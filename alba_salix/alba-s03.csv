"Double Feature: “Clairvoy-Can’t” and “Hiding Out”","ELI
So, next up: I wrote this one. It’s got some possible spoilers for our role-playing game spinoff The End of Time and Other Bothers… I say spoilers, but Magnus is involved, so who’s to say what’s true? This one is called “Hiding Out”.
Music sting.
EXT. FOREST—DAY
Whooshing and crashing noises. Magnus is practicing sword fighting with a stick.
MAGNUS
Ohoho! Nice try. You may be twice as big, but I’ve got speed and ingenuity on my side.
I know it’s not a fair fight, but hey, you were dumb enough to start it, so—
He swings and stabs.
MAGNUS
Ha! Didn’t see that coming, did you?
Of course not. Have you ever actually held a sword? Like a real sword?
You should probably think about a change in career. You know, like taking out the trash—oh wait, that’s my job. Ha ha!
A wild flurry of blows.
MAGNUS
Aww, did it hurt? Is the big bad giant scared? Why don’t you run along back to your—
HOLLY
Magnus!
Magnus whirls around, and falls over in a heap.
MAGNUS
Aaaa!
HOLLY
Magnus, what are you doing out here?
MAGNUS
I’m practicing! It’s the Mellurian Great-Heart sword technique.
HOLLY
More like Big-Mouth stick technique!
MAGNUS
Wow. Wow.
HOLLY
Sorry.
MAGNUS
Listen, trash talk is a vital part of throwing off your enemy’s game.
HOLLY
You’re supposed to be back at the House of Healing helping out the installers.
MAGNUS
They were getting along fine without me.
HOLLY
They need someone there for safety. You don’t even have to go up on the roof.
MAGNUS
Why can’t you do it?
HOLLY
I’m on reception! I’m supposed to be on reception, anyway—I shouldn’t have to come and track you down because you’re hiding out in the forest!
MAGNUS
Practicing. Practicing in the forest.
HOLLY
The Magic Support team only has a narrow window to install those lunar panels.
MAGNUS
Stupid panels. Why do we need them anyway?
HOLLY
You know why. It takes a lot of mystical energy to power all the new equipment.
MAGNUS
Which Minister Pearcey keeps dumping on us.
HOLLY
You’re just mad because you’re not allowed to use any of it.
MAGNUS
Well, it’s ridiculous! Why do we need to lock up all the fun—I mean the magic items? I can’t even use a fountain pen without having to check it out from that machine in the hall.
HOLLY
Yeah, like that’s such a burden.
MAGNUS
Hey, at least I can remember my password.
HOLLY
Everyone forgets their password.
MAGNUS
Four days in a row?
HOLLY
You need to get back to work, Magnus.
MAGNUS
We should just sign up with Mysticorp Energy. They’ll run a line straight to our front door, and do all the installation work themselves.
HOLLY
You know we can’t use them. They sell magic harvested straight from the loo lines. Using fricking! That’s so dangerous.
MAGNUS
It’s safer than the alternative!
HOLLY
What? Lunar energy is safe. And renewable, and dependable…
MAGNUS
Until it’s cloudy out.
HOLLY
The storage tanks can hold enough moonlight to last us weeks.
MAGNUS
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just… I don’t trust lunar power.
HOLLY
What do you mean, “trust”? It’s the moon!
MAGNUS
But you know, moon magic is kinda dangerous, isn’t it?
HOLLY
How could it ever be dangerous? It’s exactly the same energy that makes moondrops work. And all the equipment has been blessed by priests of Celene herself.
MAGNUS
(shudders)
Ehhh. Yeah, that’s the problem.
HOLLY
What, the priests of Celene?
MAGNUS
Don’t—
(whispers)
Don’t say her name!
HOLLY
She’s the goddess of the moon.
MAGNUS
I’m aware! I just don’t trust her.
HOLLY
Magnus, you’re being ridiculous. The moon is true and sustaining, and Celene is—
MAGNUS
Shhh! Holly!
HOLLY
What? Of all the gods and goddesses, why would you be afraid of Celene?
MAGNUS
(flinches again)
She’s always trying to spread her influence across the land. I bet you these lunar panels are a trick. She can probably see out of them, or project herself through them or—
HOLLY
Magnus. Even if she could do all that, she’s a kind and gentle goddess.
MAGNUS
Have you met her?!
HOLLY
No. Have you?
MAGNUS
Yes. I have, actually.
HOLLY
Pffft. Yeah, right.
MAGNUS
It’s true!
HOLLY
When did you meet the goddess of the Moon?!
MAGNUS
It was a few years ago, when I was delivering mail for the monastery. I was out by—you know that temple out towards Paradox? The big tree that’s been blasted by lightning?
HOLLY
The Temple of the Oracle?
MAGNUS
Yeah. I was there when it got blasted by lightning.
HOLLY
(skeptical)
Really.
MAGNUS
Yes! There was this demon and a fairy and this other scary lady who turned into a bear—there were a lot of scary ladies, actually, and they were trying to summon a different goddess, like, an ancient evil one and that’s how the tree got exploded.
HOLLY
And then Celene just showed up.
MAGNUS
She did! She showed up in a chariot covered in all this blue fire, and she wanted the demon guy to dedicate the tree temple to her but he made her mad and she sent us all away and there was a giant monster and we fell off it and the fairy couldn’t fly and we nearly died like a hundred times but then she pulled us back to her castle and…
(he trails off)
HOLLY
And?
MAGNUS
Oh man. I just remembered. Cel—the moon goddess, she gave me a task to perform.
HOLLY
She gave YOU a task?
MAGNUS
But I forgot. I totally forgot about it until now. Oh no.
HOLLY
You. An ordinary human boy.
MAGNUS
She knew my name and everything! And she said… I was supposed to deliver a message to my future boss.
HOLLY
Who? Alba?
MAGNUS
She must have meant Alba. Oh geez, I’m so dead.
HOLLY
Magnus, when are you not “so dead”?
MAGNUS
(whimpers)
HOLLY
So what was the message?
MAGNUS
She said, tell your boss that the Goddess of the Moon says… hello.
Silence.
HOLLY
That’s it?
MAGNUS
I think that was it.
Silence.
HOLLY
So, are you coming back to help with these panels?
MAGNUS
Yeah, okay.

Music sting.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
Magnus roots around the pantry shelves.
MAGNUS
Where is it, where is it? Uuugh…
All right. If I was Alba, where would I hide it…? Hmm, I’m Alba—I am judgey, I am disapproving, I like bubbleberry cake and I need to hide it from Magnus. ‘No cake for you, Magnus, you haven’t earned it, you’re too lazy, so I’ll hide my ill-gotten booty where you’ll never look—I’ll hide it innnn… the mop bucket!’
Magnus grabs the wooden mop bucket. Nothing.
MAGNUS
Dammit!
HOLLY
What are you doing?
MAGNUS
Aaaaaargh! Holly! Don’t sneak up on people!
HOLLY
I wasn’t ‘sneaking’—fairies don’t sneak, Magnus. And we closed hours ago… What are you up to?
MAGNUS
I could ask you the same question!
Holly holds out a bag.
HOLLY
I’ve been collecting Scaly Wool-weed. The roots have to be harvested by night, and dried immediately.
MAGNUS
Oh, good. That’s… good. Carry on.
HOLLY
Wait! Hahaha! You’re looking for the cake, aren’t you? Alba said you wouldn’t be able to keep your hands off it.
MAGNUS
I am being unjustly denied my rights.
HOLLY
That bubbleberry cake was a present for Alba!
MAGNUS
Hey, it was for the whole House of Healing! I did my part! If I wasn’t holding the door closed when those bees attacked Jerome, we’d all have got stung!
HOLLY
That’s right—instead of just me, Alba and Jerome.
MAGNUS
You guys were goners anyway. It was damage limitation!
HOLLY
Well, you’ll never find the cake, Magnus, not in a million years. And even if you do, Alba told me she booby-trapped it, so how’s that for damage limitation!
MAGNUS
She was probably just saying that to scare you off. Hold on… do you know where it is?
(beat)
You do, don’t you! You’re folding your wings in that smug way…
HOLLY
As a matter of fact, I found it this afternoon.
MAGNUS
Yesss! Where is it, where is it?
HOLLY
I’m not telling.
MAGNUS
Holly, you gotta tell me. It’s inhumane! I’ll do the laundry for a week. Come on, what does it take to get you to snitch?
HOLLY
I’m not snitching! Fairies don’t ‘snitch’! We don’t do anything starting with ‘sn’, Magnus: no sneaking, no snitching, no… no snuffling!
MAGNUS
Ok, fine. You found it this afternoon. Great. And if you can do it, I can do it. All I have to do is retrace your movements…
HOLLY
Wait, no, that’s not what I—
Magnus starts pulling boxes around.
MAGNUS
Let’s see now… You changed all the dots above the ‘i’s on the jar labels into little hearts—adorable!—but I already looked there…
He climbs up on the counter.
MAGNUS
Then you cleaned the ceiling for the third time this week after one of your potions blew up for the third time this week. And… aha!
HOLLY
Magnus, be careful! It’s not—
MAGNUS
Aaaahaha! Thought I’d never go looking up here, did you?
HOLLY
Magnus, don’t touch that!
She flies up alongside Magnus. They struggle with a cake tin.
MAGNUS
Hey, get off me! Well well well, what have we here? A shiny blue cake tin.
HOLLY
No! It’s for Alba! Give it to me!
MAGNUS
Argh! Hey, I deserve cake!
He loses his footing and both tumble to the floor with a scream.
Squelch!
Silence.
MAGNUS
Booby trap, huh?
HOLLY
This is all your fault.
MAGNUS
(straining)
I can’t get my hand off the tin!
HOLLY
I know. Me neither.
MAGNUS
Holly, what is this stuff?
HOLLY
I don’t know… It smells like… Igneous Glue?
MAGNUS
Great. Punished for my success once again.
(struggles)
Oh man, we’re stuck good.
HOLLY
We’ve gotta go find Alba.
MAGNUS
I’m not going anywhere and you can’t make me!
HOLLY
You wanna bet? We’re stuck together now.
MAGNUS
Oh really? How about this: We’re going to get this glue off and pretend this never happened, or when Alba finds us with our hands stuck to this cake tin, I’m going to tell her that you were the one stealing it.
HOLLY
(scoffs)
What?! Alba will never believe you! You’ve done nothing but lie and scheme! Why would she believe you over me?
MAGNUS
Oh, you poor, poor fool. That’s not how blame works! Of course Alba won’t believe me!
(beat)
But there’s always doubt, isn’t there, Holly? There’s always a tiny sliver of doubt! There’s probably a million to one chance that I’m telling the truth. But I’ll keep insisting on it—for years and years, long after a normal person would have given up! I’ll be outraged and unshakeable, and pretty soon that little sliver of doubt’s going to grow. Alba’s gonna think, ‘No one would keep lying like this for so long,’ and that million to one chance will suddenly feel like a hundred to one. Then she’ll start noticing all the little inconsistencies, Holly, the little inconsistencies in your story as the years dim your memory—but my story will stay the same! And that hundred to one will start feeling like ten to one, then fifty-fifty! ‘You’d have to be crazy to lie for this long!’ she’ll think. ‘Maybe he really is telling the truth…’
HOLLY
Oh my gods, you’re a monster!
MAGNUS
I’m a fighter, Holly! I’ll never give in! So you better help me get this glue off, or one day, however long it takes, you’re gonna look as guilty as me!
HOLLY
Fine! Ugh, you’re the worst!
(sigh)
I heard somewhere that maybe you can dissolve Igneous Glue…
MAGNUS
See, that’s more like it!
HOLLY
OK, I’ve got it. Let’s get some Oil of Satyr’s Hoof—that always does the job for softening King Gunther’s foot calluses.
MAGNUS
Gross.
HOLLY
It’s around here somewhere…
They stumble to the pantry. Holly browses through jars, finding the Oil of Satyr’s Hoof. She’s trying to reach over and around Magnus.
MAGNUS
Aah, stop shoving me!
HOLLY
Well, you keep stepping on my toes!
MAGNUS
Only ’cause you’re in the way.
HOLLY
No, you’re in the way! Get your big feet out of here!
MAGNUS
Hey, my feet aren’t big, they’re… luxurious. Everyone says so.
HOLLY
What kind of luxury is that?
MAGNUS
Well at least I don’t snore!
HOLLY
What?! I do not snore! Fairies don’t snore! ‘S’ ‘N’, Magnus!
MAGNUS
Well, I hate to be the bearer of, y’know, truth, Holly, but you snore just like the rest of us lowly mortals.
HOLLY
But I—I… Is it at least a cute snore? Like a vole?
MAGNUS
Ha! More like a whole herd of voles falling down a well!
HOLLY
Oh no…!
MAGNUS
Remember when you were ‘testing’ that new Amborella tincture and fell asleep? And you woke up with a tea cosy over your head?
HOLLY
(gasp)
I knew that was you!
MAGNUS
What was I supposed to do? Your cute little snoring was gonna shatter the windows!
HOLLY
Ugggh! When I get free of you, I’m definitely telling Alba you stole her cake.
MAGNUS
We’ve been over this already, Holly, I am a master of manipulation!
HOLLY
Just hold still, this is going to soften the glue.
Holly uncorks the bottle and tips a little of the oil onto hers and Magnus’s hands.
Pause.
MAGNUS
Well?
HOLLY
It doesn’t—it doesn’t seem to be working…!
MAGNUS
What do you mean? The glue can’t be harder than the king’s calluses—he wears out his shoes from the inside!
HOLLY
Pull!
MAGNUS
Aaraaaargh!
HOLLY
Uggghh…
MAGNUS
Well, your way didn’t work. It’s time to try it my way.
HOLLY
Noooo, let’s just go to Alba!
MAGNUS
No! We’re fighters, Holly! Glue that cannot be dissolved must be melted!
He starts rummaging in a drawer.
HOLLY
Magnus, we are not getting anywhere near a fire with this!
MAGNUS
I’m not an idiot, Holly, I’m not going to light us on fire.
HOLLY
That’s what you said last time.
MAGNUS
We’ll just hold our hands close to the fire, so that the glue melts.
HOLLY
Igneous Glue is made with lava, Magnus, you can’t melt it!
MAGNUS
Not with that attitude.
HOLLY
Not with any attitude!
Front door and footsteps.
HOLLY
(gasp)
Oh no! She’s back!
MAGNUS
Everyone for themselves!
They try running in opposite directions, but their hands are still stuck and they fall to the floor.
MAGNUS
Get off me!
HOLLY
You get off me!
The door opens. Footsteps enter, and stop dead.
ALBA
Well?
MAGNUS
Holly did it!
HOLLY
(gasps)
Music sting.

Music sting.
INT. OPERA HOUSE
An orchestra tunes up, while the audience talks in sibilant whispers.
FIRST OPERA-GOER
(male, a huge, snooty voice)
“A tour de force”, I’m told.
SECOND OPERA-GOER
(female, equally huge and snooty)
Well, we shall see. I hope we can at least put that wretched ballet last season behind us.
FIRST OPERA-GOER
Ugh! The music was bad enough, but the costumes!
SECOND OPERA-GOER
Say no more.
FIRST OPERA-GOER
Ugh. Have they replaced these seats? My tail is getting crushed.
Magnus and Holly work their way down the aisle, bumping into patrons as they approach.
MAGNUS
Excuse me.
HOLLY
Pardon me. Sorry.
MAGNUS
Coming through.
SECOND OPERA-GOER
(with distaste)
The human section is up there.
HOLLY
I’m a fairy, I’ll have you know.
SECOND OPERA-GOER
(scoffs)
Humanoid, then. Who can tell all you little things apart?
Holly flutters her wings angrily.
HOLLY
Look! Wings!
MAGNUS
Okay, maybe don’t antagonize everyone in our row, Holly.
They move on.
FIRST OPERA-GOER
They’re just letting anyone in now.
SECOND OPERA-GOER
Sad, isn’t it?
HOLLY
This looks like a good spot.
MAGNUS
All this fuss just to get a few dragon tears. I bet I could make a dragon cry without having to sit through an opera.
HOLLY
Who’s being antagonizing now?
MAGNUS
I’m not!
HOLLY
You always have to resort to violence.
MAGNUS
Who said anything about violence? Look, we just tell a couple dragons a sad story, collect their tears, and buzz off.
HOLLY
Dragons almost never cry.
MAGNUS
Well, this better be one sad freakin’ opera, then.
Holly opens her program.
HOLLY
Oh, dragon opera is where they let it all those feelings out! It’s always so big and tragic and passionate and emotional. And this show is supposed to be amazing.
(reads)
“Enziga Krammarbatch: an audacious new work of theatrical magic.” And we can say we saw it on opening night!
MAGNUS
You can say that. I’m gonna be over here sleeping.
HOLLY
Magnus, don’t you dare! You need to be ready with your pan.
MAGNUS
Alba got me up at four this morning and I’ve been riding on carts and wagons all day to get here. My bruises have bruises. All so I can come here to watch dragons stomp around and sing.
HOLLY
But how amazing is that? Dragons! Stomping around! Singing! It’s high culture!
The audience breaks into applause, then falls silent as the conductor taps a baton.
Then the music starts: gentle woodwinds and strings that quickly turn ominous as the soprano begins to belt out her first notes.
SINGER
Ins Foia dei us griben Gretza / Hem zen Ziga af Fronenfifa…
MAGNUS
Oh man, four hours of this?
HOLLY
Okay, this is a little different than I was expecting.
SINGER
Dal faunen eis Golfa dei / Com pritza, Fiantschi / Al Dimal dudal Tei
The music rises to fever pitch, with pummeling, atonal strings and brass. The audience begins to mutter and even boo.
SINGER
La Chita dala Picalinga / Da fonen is—
The singer hits a particularly startling note—then screams suddenly as she’s hit with flying produce, and falls over.
The audience is in an uproar, tearing up the seats and throwing them.
MAGNUS
All right! This is more like it.
HOLLY
Magnus, run!
MAGNUS
Are you kidding? This right here is worth the trip.
The shouts turn to roars. Fire starts to crackle.
MAGNUS
Yeah! Burn it all down! Woo!
HOLLY
I’m getting out of here.
MAGNUS
Haha! You scared of a little dragon riot?
HOLLY
Yes, actually!
MAGNUS
Some people don’t know how to have a good time. Whoaaa! Hey! Put me down!
One of the dragons picks Magnus up and flings him across the theatre.
MAGNUS
High culture can kiss my aaaass!
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
Magnus and Holly stagger in, shell-shocked.
ALBA
Holly! Magnus!
MAGNUS
Dragon opera? Can go suck it.
HOLLY
I still can’t feel my wings.
ALBA
What happened?
HOLLY
It was a brand new opera. Very controversial.
MAGNUS
It sounded like a herd of elephants decided to start an orchestra-slash-wrestling league.
ALBA
That’s how it usually sounds.
HOLLY
No, no, I’ve heard dragon opera. This was… different. It was audacious and iconoclastic.
MAGNUS
You know, when those guys decide to have a riot, they don’t mess around.
HOLLY
Some people throw tomatoes. Dragons throw forty-pound pumpkins.
MAGNUS
And sides of beef.
HOLLY
And fairies.
MAGNUS
And humans.
ALBA
So, in other words, you didn’t get any tears at all.
MAGNUS
Nope, none. Except… for this huge damn bottle.
He sets the bottle on the counter.
ALBA
What? That’s… that’s nearly a pint.
HOLLY
You’re welcome!
ALBA
What’s really in this bottle?
HOLLY
Tears! Genuine dragon tears! See, after they burned down the amphitheatre…
ALBA
After they what?
MAGNUS
Yeah, I mean, you’d think dragons of all people would know how to make things fireproof.
HOLLY
We found the soprano and the theatre owner in the bar across the street, getting drunk and crying their eyes out. They were so heartbroken.
ALBA
Really!
MAGNUS
I want it on record that I had nothing to do with any of the property damage that occurred.
ALBA
All right. Good work.
HOLLY
Yay! Go team!
Holly and Magnus high-five.
HOLLY
Ow.
MAGNUS
Ow. I’m gonna go lie down now.
