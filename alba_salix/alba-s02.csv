"Alba Salix 201: By The Book","INTRODUCTION
ELI
Welcome back to the land of Farloria! It’s time at last for Alba Salix, Volume Two. I’m Eli, co-writer and co-producer of this here show. This is the first of six episodes, coming at you weekly from now through the beginning of December.
This episode is sponsored by Join the Party, a Dungeons & Dragons real play podcast that’s exciting, inclusive, character-driven and completely hilarious.
Johnny’s a warlock on a mission to bring the Light to everyone in the land, and make sure they party responsibly. Inara is a super cool queer skater teen out to become an assassin and impress the ladies, not necessarily in that order. And Tracy—that’s Designation TR8C—is an adorable, excitable robot with a few rage issues. Together, they’re saving princes, running errands for gods, and surviving madcap reality show tournaments.
It’s the podcast that got me hooked on real play podcasts. And don’t worry: you don’t need to know the rules to enjoy it. It’s just good fun.
That is Join the Party. You can find out all about it at jointhepartypod.com.
And now, it’s time for Alba Salix, Volume Two, Episode One.
MUSIC STING
EXT. PALACE COURTYARD—DAY
Ominous music.
EMPEROR ROCKHART
People of Farloria! This day, your tiny kingdom joins the mighty Empire of Balgomar. Our Empire—your Empire—shall be immeasurably enriched by your people, your culture, and your precious, precious minerals. The magical energy that runs through your land shall fuel Balgomar for years to come!
A crowd cheers.
ROCKHART (CONT’D)
And to rule your small, quaint little province, I, Emperor Rockhart, give you your King and Queen-to-be: Prince Bulwark and Princess Minsey!
MINSEY
(giggles)
That’s us, darling!
BULWARK
Yes! A kingdom of our very own!
MINSEY
You know, I’ve always liked this palace far more than that icky little pile of old rocks in Fair-Upon-Middling.
BULWARK
Yes, truly this is a place fit for your beauteous self.
MINSEY
Oh, darling. My sweet little Bully Wully is going to be king!
BULWARK
That’s me! Kingy Wingy!
They giggle.
MINSEY
You silly, silly boy.
ROCKHART
(clears his throat)
Your Majesties.
BULWARK
Yes, Father? Oh, I suppose we should say something to our new subjects, shouldn’t we? Um, hello!
MINSEY
Hello!
The crowd gives a shout.
ROCKHART
A bright new future lies ahead for Farloria. But first, we must sweep aside the past. Bring forth the prisoners!
Heavy chains rattle. The dramatic music returns.
PARABEL
Let go of me! Murderers! Usurpers!
GUNTHER
I say, there’s no need for all this unpleasantness.
PARABEL
You may take our lives, but the spirit of Farloria shall never be defeated.
MINSEY
Oh, be quiet, Auntie Parabel.
GUNTHER
Minsey! How could you do this to us?
MINSEY
I’m so sorry, Uncle Gunther. But Daddy-in-law is right.
ROCKHART
Well said, my girl.
PARABEL
I knew it would come to this!
GUNTHER
Minsey, please.
MINSEY
No! No, the line of succession is clear: so as long as you and your son are alive, our flimsy, foreign-sponsored claim to the throne is invalid, and therefore the only proper thing to do now is… off with their heads!
A roar from the crowd. Minsey and Bulwark’s giggling turns evil, then begins to echo unnaturally as the crowd chants, “Off with their heads!”
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. PALACE BEDCHAMBER—NIGHT
PARABEL
Nooo!
She sits up violently in bed, startling Gunther awake.
GUNTHER
Darling! Parabel! What on earth is the matter?
PARABEL
Those little fiends! They won’t take my son!
GUNTHER
Who won’t? What son?
PARABEL
Oh. Goodness, you’re right. I just dreamt I had a son…
GUNTHER
Perhaps it’s a good omen, then.
PARABEL
No! No, Gunther, it was a nightmare!
GUNTHER
Deep breaths, my treasure. Let’s get you some quell-flower tea.
He rings the servants’ bell.
PARABEL
(breathes deeply)
Yes. Yes, thank you, dear.
GUNTHER
That’s the third night this week. Perhaps you ought to see your sister about this? She’s coming to the Palace in the morning.
PARABEL
Hmm. Perhaps I should.
GUNTHER
She and that fairy of hers can probably come up with something stronger than tea.
PARABEL
Yes. We’ll need something much, much stronger.
OPENING THEME
HERALD
By Appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician—Volume Two! Episode the First: By The Book.
INT. EXAM ROOM—MORNING
ALBA
So what seems to be the problem, Mister, uh…?
Sir Galitus’s voice is slightly muffled. He still has his helmet on, and his armour jingles as he speaks.
GALITUS
Galitus. Sir Galitus Lightwind the Pure, slayer of foul monsters, bringer of peace and justice.
ALBA
And have you had any—
GALITUS
’Twas I who forded the Great Raging River and pulled the Mighty Mace of Maxilarth from the Heaving Swamp.
ALBA
Congratulations. What brings you to the House of Healing?
GALITUS
Madam Salix, the matter is slightly embarrassing.
ALBA
Believe me, we’ve seen everything here.
GALITUS
Um… I appear to have a rash upon my face.
ALBA
That’s all?
GALITUS
To be the noblest of knights, one needs the noblest face, to stir the hearts of the good folk of the kingdom. But now I must keep my helmet on so that none will see my great disfigurement.
ALBA
I’m sure it’s fine. Come on, helmet off.
GALITUS
Do I have to?
ALBA
I pulled a spoon out of a toddler’s nose this morning. I’m not worried about your little rash.
GALITUS
Yes. Very well.
Galitus takes off his helmet with a clank.
ALBA
Oh dear, this is a bad one.
GALITUS
Indeed. Methinks it came about when I slew the fearsome Manticore of the Northern Wastes.
ALBA
How do you figure?
GALITUS
It didst smite me with its venom, such that my legs grew weak. But I held my ground and laid low the beast that had terrorized—
ALBA
Did it smite you in the face?
GALITUS
No, no, it was my shin.
ALBA
I don’t think the manticore caused your rash.
GALITUS
I think you’ll find it did.
ALBA
Let me see that helmet. You’ve been wearing this a lot, haven’t you?
GALITUS
Well, yes. This helm was crafted by the dwarven smiths of Logath-Blaggit.
ALBA
I think your skin is having a reaction to the metal.
GALITUS
’Twas forged and shaped precisely to fit me! Surely it is hypoallergenic.
ALBA
We’re going to have to run some tests.
(calls)
Magnus!
Magnus enters. Galitus hurriedly puts the helmet back on.
MAGNUS
Yo, what’s up, boss?
GALITUS
Don’t bring in more people!
ALBA
This is my apprentice, Magnus. Magnus, I think Sir Galitus here is having an issue with his helmet. Sir Galitus, if you would?
GALITUS
Well… fine.
He takes the helmet off.
MAGNUS
Oh, that’s brutal. Sweet helmet, though. Dwarves make this?
GALITUS
Aye.
MAGNUS
Badass. What’s this writing around the inside?
GALITUS
Those be the magic runes of the dwarves of the East-Northeast. I bested their champion in a duel for their vast mountain kingdom, but great-hearted as I am, I asked only for a fine helm from their legendary forge.
MAGNUS
So what does it say?
GALITUS
It reads, “To he who cheats death.”
ALBA
Of course! That’s what it is.
GALITUS
What what is?
ALBA
The mark on your forehead. Three crossed lines. It’s a rune too. In olden days, the dwarves used to brand their criminals with that very symbol.
GALITUS
Criminals?!
ALBA
And this doesn’t say “To he who cheats death.”
GALITUS
It does so!
Alba taps the inside of the helmet.
ALBA
It starts here. “Death to he who cheats.”
GALITUS
I would never cheat!
ALBA
Tell me, this duel that you won…
GALITUS
I did not switch our swords! It’s a filthy lie!
ALBA
Uh huh.
MAGNUS
What do you think, Alba? Orb of Hydrogenes?
ALBA
If you would.
Magnus fetches the Orb and waves it. It makes a magical shimmer which suddenly perks up as he gets close to the helmet.
MAGNUS
Oh yeah. This is one cursed-ass helmet.
ALBA
And you see, right across the forehead, there’s where they inscribed your magic rune. Precisely the same shape and location as your rash.
GALITUS
They marked me! Those little mongrels! With their filthy magic and their… their wordplay.
ALBA
Well, not to worry. We can fix this. Holly!
Holly enters. Galitus puts his helmet back on.
GALITUS
What…? No, not more people!
HOLLY
Hi Alba! Hi Mister Knight!
GALITUS
(petulant)
I’m not a “mister”.
ALBA
Sir Galitus, this is our resident herbalist, Holly. And the sooner you take the helmet back off, the sooner we can fix your rash.
Galitus sighs and complies.
HOLLY
Oh gosh. Mister… Sir, your forehead!
GALITUS
This is humiliating.
HOLLY
Did you cheat a clan of dwarves?
MAGNUS
He so did.
GALITUS
I resent these accusations.
ALBA
It looks like a simple spectral concentrator. Holly, do you have anything that will reverse it?
HOLLY
A solution of Penroth’s Blue Chickweed and some Revolting Violet should clear it up in a day or two.
ALBA
See to it, please.
HOLLY
You got it.
She heads for the pantry.
GALITUS
(quietly)
Will this prevent the… death part?
ALBA
Death part?
GALITUS
If the runes say “death to he who cheats…” does that mean I am to die?
ALBA
I don’t think so. But you might want to go back and ask them. Very nicely.
GALITUS
Yes, Madam Salix.
ALBA
Now, if you’d like to have a seat outside, Holly will be right out to bring you your prescription.
Galitus dons his helmet once again.
GALITUS
Yes, Madam Salix.
He leaves the room.
ALBA
Good work.
MAGNUS
You know it. So? What do you say to teaching me some more magic?
ALBA
Have all those bile samples been tested?
MAGNUS
Oh. Yeah. I’m almost done. Partly done. Somewhat.
I’ll start on it today.
ALBA
Yes, please. I’m off to the Palace in a minute. We’ll talk when I get back.
MAGNUS
Yeah we will!
Alba shuts the door.
MUSIC STING
INT. THRONE ROOM—LATER THAT MORNING
Alba rummages in her bag.
ALBA
Here. A tonic of reverium sap and truncheon berry. One mouthful just before bedtime should bring on a good night’s sleep, and pleasant dreams.
Parabel uncorks the small bottle and sniffs it.
PARABEL
Ugh! It’s revolting.
ALBA
Well, it’s tonic or nightmares. Take your pick.
PARABEL
I can’t drink this.
GUNTHER
Really? It smells delightful to me.
PARABEL
Some of us have more delicate senses.
ALBA
Well, I’ll leave it here, in case you change your mind.
GUNTHER
If that’s all settled, Alba, we’d like you to join us for lunch.
ALBA
Oh. Yes. Lovely. Hopefully not a long lunch.
GUNTHER
Come along. It should be waiting for us.
They walk out together into the corridor.
ALBA
What’s the occasion?
GUNTHER
I’m sure you’ve been wondering what’s going to become of the Office of the Sorceror General, now that our Sorceror General has, um…
ALBA
Been arrested for plotting to murder your niece, and fled the kingdom?
PARABEL
He acted alone, I understand!
GUNTHER
Yes. Rather. Well, considering that little incident, we’ve consulted with the Mages’ Guild and decided to reorganize the OSG under non-wizardly oversight.
ALBA
Oh? It’s about time. Who’s leading it?
Gunther opens a door and ushers Alba and Parabel into a reception room. As they enter, a calm, measured woman in her 30s stands up from the table: Antalia Pearcey.
GUNTHER
I’m glad you asked. Here she is. Good morning!
PEARCEY
Your Majesties.
PARABEL
Hello, Minister.
GUNTHER
Alba, may I present Antalia Pearcey, late of the Ministry of Transportation. Ms. Pearcey, this is Alba Salix, our Royal Physician.
ALBA
Nice to meet you.
PEARCEY
And you. I’ve heard so many good things.
GUNTHER
Ms. Pearcey will bring her administrative talents to bear, overseeing an all-new department known as the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health.
ALBA
Well, I think that will be a great step—wait, health?
GUNTHER
Yes! Since so much of your practice is mucking about with magical… things, we thought it would fit like a proverbial glove.
ALBA
Well sure, I use magic, but… Ms. Pearcey, I thought you were going to be taking over the Office of Planning?
PEARCEY
That was the original idea. But His Majesty has taken such a keen interest in the kingdom’s architecture…
ALBA
Gunther? You’re going to head the Planning Office?
GUNTHER
Yes, it turns out I have a talent for it! It came as quite a surprise.
PEARCEY
Yes, quite a surprise.
GUNTHER
I’ve been overseeing a new project there this week. They’re designing a public square in front of the new Mysticorp headquarters. Look at this!
He pulls out a sheet of paper.
ALBA
Is that supposed to be a pair of dragons?
GUNTHER
Yes, that was my idea. It’s a fountain!
ALBA
Oh, I see. So that’s water that they’re… vomiting.
GUNTHER
Spouting.
ALBA
Spouting. Sorry.
GUNTHER
There’ll be lights too. All magically powered. It’s most exciting.
ALBA
As long as His Majesty refrains from having my garden torn out.
PARABEL
Oh, your garden again. One little decree and I never hear the end of it.
A servant enters with a tray.
GUNTHER
Oh look. Here comes our lunch!
PARABEL
What is this? I specifically said, no cucumber!
SERVANT
But Your Majesty—
PARABEL
Loathsome. Take it away!
GUNTHER
I’ll gladly have yours. What would you rather, my dear?
PARABEL
(fumes, then:)
Are there any anchovies in the kitchen? And pickled plums?
SERVANT
I will fetch some right away, Majesty.
The servant hurries off.
GUNTHER
Good heavens.
PARABEL
I just felt like having something salty.
ALBA
Curse those delicate senses of yours.
PARABEL
(huffs)
I’ll be in the kitchen.
She exits as well.
GUNTHER
Parabel!
(back to Alba and Pearcey)
Ah, well. Where was I?
ALBA
So Your Majesty will be in charge of planning.
Uh, Ms. Pearcey…
PEARCEY
Yes?
ALBA
Do you have any experience overseeing magic? Or health?
PEARCEY
Our roads and ports are used by many magical vehicles.
ALBA
So… no.
GUNTHER
But Farlorian roads and ports are now among the finest on the continent!
ALBA
Aside from that little incident where we tried to run dragon boats and swan boats along the same stretch of canal.
PEARCEY
(haunted)
That was not my idea.
ALBA
So what is your plan for this new Ministry?
PEARCEY
In a word: standardization.
ALBA
And in more words?
PEARCEY
We want to replicate your success with the House of Healing. Expand it.
GUNTHER
Alba, you’ve been arguing for months that we should better serve our more remote regions.
ALBA
Well, yes. Think of the Pointy Lands. We’ve got a whole province going to see one overworked witch in a candy cottage that’s been chewed to pieces by the local kids.
PEARCEY
Exactly. So we need to develop a blueprint for service delivery.
GUNTHER
(eager)
A blueprint. Yes, yes.
PEARCEY
We are going to systematize the way you run the House of Healing. Examine what you do to create a manual of best practices. Everything down to the last pill, potion and procedure.
ALBA
(scoffs)
Everything? In one manual?
PEARCEY
I believe that’s what I said.
ALBA
I mean, we’re good at what we do, but every case is different. Every patient, every complaint…
PEARCEY
But it’s the delivery that stays the same.
(heading off Alba)
Which is why we’re going to proceed with implementing the EIIRP‑9 standard across all our facilities.
ALBA
Are you.
PEARCEY
Yes. We are. And that “we” includes you. And everyone at the House of Healing.
ALBA
Lucky “us”.
GUNTHER
Very sensible indeed. Er… what is an E double‑I…?
PEARCEY
…RP. Everything In Its Right Place, Level 9. The same standard I implemented at the Ministry of Transportation. Outlining our desired outcomes, processes and decision-making approach.
GUNTHER
Well, that sounds terribly worthwhile. I should be getting along now—got to be at the mint to approve my portrait for next year’s coins.
PEARCEY
Ms. Salix, I’d love to dive right in and pay a visit to your clinic. How does this afternoon sound?
ALBA
Why, that should be no problem at all.
GUNTHER
I do love it when my staff gets along.
MUSIC STING
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—RECEPTION
Alba has just arrived back at the HH in a flurry.
HOLLY
What are you worried about, Alba? I love organizing!
ALBA
The new Minister is revamping everything. New procedures, new rules…
MAGNUS
I always said what we need here is more rules.
ALBA
Well, you’ve got ’em.
She dumps an armload of books on the counter.
MAGNUS
Whoa. That’s… some books.
HOLLY
Yay for books!
ALBA
Those are just the index. The Minister’s on her way here now, and I saw one of her assistants loading a wheelbarrow.
HOLLY
Gosh. These are all books on how to do our jobs?
ALBA
Nope. They’re books on how to decide how to do our jobs.
MAGNUS
We get to decide?
ALBA
Minister Pearcey gets to decide.
(sighs)
We’re probably going to have to change everything. Just when we were starting to find our rhythm.
MAGNUS
So pull rank, then! You could be all like, “My sister is the Queen, so there! Off with your head, sucker!”
ALBA
I would appreciate it if you didn’t say things like that in front of the Minister. And can we please clean up here? What are these vials doing all over the reception desk?
MAGNUS
They’re the bile samples you asked me to analyze. Look. Results right here.
He waves a thick folder.
HOLLY
Wow, that’s a whole pile of bile vial trial files!
MAGNUS
Right?
HOLLY
See, that rhymed!
ALBA
Yes, thank you. Magnus, if you have laboratory work to do, you do it in the laboratory.
MAGNUS
Well, today the lab smells like dead, burnt fish.
HOLLY
It’s not fish, it’s seaweed.
MAGNUS
Oh sure, sorry, that’s perfectly fine, then.
HOLLY
It’s a remedy for milkmaid’s knee. Or it will be. I’m this close to nailing the formula. This close!
MAGNUS
Have you tried not setting fire to it?
ALBA
Both of you, get all these vials put away in the lab.
MAGNUS
Boy, somebody’s stressed out.
ALBA
Now.
HOLLY
Okay!
Magnus and Holly gather up the vials and open the door to the lab. Alba gasps at the smell.
ALBA
Holly, I think we should discuss letting you work from home.
HOLLY
But I like it here! Isn’t it nice to have company while you work?
ALBA
Company, yes. Toxic fumes, no.
MAGNUS
See? Could you work under these conditions?
ALBA
That’s enough, Magnus.
The door opens and Pearcey enters.
PEARCEY
Good afternoon—
(suddenly gagging)
What is that smell?
Magnus returns and shuts the door.
MAGNUS
Oh, nothing, just violating our own health and safety rules.
ALBA
Holly, Magnus, this is Antalia Pearcey, the new Minister of Magical Affairs… and Health.
PEARCEY
Hello, team.
ALBA
Ms. Pearcey, this is Holly, our herbalist and potions specialist.
HOLLY
Hi there!
ALBA
And my apprentice Magnus.
MAGNUS
Apprentice surgeon.
HOLLY
Would you like a cup of tea?
MAGNUS
(whispers)
Say no.
PEARCEY
(stiffly)
It’s good to meet you all. You might be wondering why I’m here today.
MAGNUS
Are you taking over the kingdom?
ALBA
Magnus.
PEARCEY
Am I what?
MAGNUS
I mean, you’re the new Sorceror General, right?
PEARCEY
In a sense. But there is no longer a Sorceror General.
MAGNUS
The old guy was all bent on taking over. I thought it was like a wizard thing.
PEARCEY
I’m not a wizard. That’s the whole point. We’re getting off topic here.
(clears her throat)
As Farloria grows, the demands on the House of Healing will become greater. There’ll be more patients to treat. You’ll need to expand. Bring on more staff. And I know that you can all rise to meet these new challenges with talent and enthusiasm.
HOLLY
Yay!
MAGNUS
Yay.
HOLLY
I don’t know what you were complaining about, Alba. This is going to be great!
PEARCEY
Is there an issue, Ms. Salix?
ALBA
I thought my staff might have some concerns.
HOLLY
Nope!
PEARCEY
Change is always hard. And there are definitely changes ahead. Normalizing procedures. Staff training. Labour standards.
MAGNUS
(mock incredulity)
Standards? For labour?
PEARCEY
That’s right.
MAGNUS
Would that mean, for instance, that I’d get to sleep indoors?
ALBA
The toolshed is indoors.
MAGNUS
Well, maybe according to the letter of the law…
PEARCEY
That’s definitely something we’d address when we do our assessment of working conditions in Stage Two.
MAGNUS
I got an assessment for you.
ALBA
Stage Two, Magnus. We have to do these things in the proper order.
HOLLY
What’s Stage One?
PEARCEY
Stage One is what we call a “user needs assessment”. We discover who is visiting the House of Healing…
ALBA
That would be “everyone in the city”.
PEARCEY
…what services they require, and what you require to deliver those services. Stage Two is about your experience here to date. The working conditions, but also your opinions. Your feelings.
HOLLY
Our feelings? Aww! You’re the best, Ms. Pearcey.
PEARCEY
That’s… uh, thank you?
HOLLY
The way Alba was talking, I thought this was going to be nothing but paperwork.
PEARCEY
No, no. Most of it is about listening. Just as an example… I’d like to get from each of you a couple of words that you think describe the House of Healing.
HOLLY
Ooh! Ooh! Today I’m feeling pride. Because we helped eight patients today, including a knight with a really rare curse, and a sweet old couple with toad pox! That’s such a tricky one to diagnose, but we did it! Because we’re the team that heals! Together!
PEARCEY
So. Pride—that’s a good one. Any others? Magnus?
MAGNUS
Let’s see…
HOLLY
Satisfaction! Last week, I just finished relabeling every last bottle, box, pouch and canister in the pantry. See? They all have their name and catalogue number here. I love decorating the labels.
She picks up a bottle.
PEARCEY
Yes, very thorough. Er, does this say “Sockweed”? No… “Storkwort”?
ALBA
It’s “Goblin grass”.
PEARCEY
That’s a “G”?
ALBA
You get the hang of Holly’s handwriting after a few months.
MAGNUS
Speak for yourself.
HOLLY
Organized!
PEARCEY
I beg your pardon?
HOLLY
When I first started here, I owed Alba many, many good deeds, and it always felt like I could never catch up. Now I finally feel like I’m on top of everything and I know where everything is!
PEARCEY
Well. That will certainly come in very useful soon as we implement the new cataloguing system.
HOLLY
New… cataloguing system?
PEARCEY
Oh yes. When we’re finished, we’ll have a searchable inventory of all the assets at the House of Healing. Have a look through the manual if you want to read ahead.
Pearcey sets another heavy tome on the counter.
HOLLY
“Everything In Its Right Place.” That sounds… sensible.
MAGNUS
Ha ha! Now you’re going to have to redo everything.
ALBA
Magnus.
HOLLY
It’s okay. If it’s that important to you, Ms. Pearcey, we can do it!
PEARCEY
I appreciate it. So. Magnus? What words would you use to describe your workplace experience?
MAGNUS
Gruelling. Boring. Uh… endless.
PEARCEY
Really! Perhaps you could expand on those.
MAGNUS
Intensely gruelling. Mind-numbingly boring. Endlessly… bad.
ALBA
Ms. Pearcey, I should apologize for my apprentice.
PEARCEY
No, it’s quite all right. I want our employees to feel free to speak their minds.
MAGNUS
Alba’s just mad because she won’t be able to hit me any more.
PEARCEY
She hits you?
ALBA
I…! I’ve never hit him that hard. And never when he didn’t deserve it.
PEARCEY
Physical correction is explicitly forbidden under the Ministry Code of Conduct.
MAGNUS
This one time, I broke a jar, and she hauled me out to the garden and made me eat brimstone peppers!
ALBA
No one made you eat them.
MAGNUS
She totally tricked me into it! She’s like, “Here, you have to learn to identify plants by taste. Eat this.”
ALBA
Well, can you pick out a brimstone pepper by taste now?
PEARCEY
Clearly, we also need to establish a standard course of study for House of Healing employees.
ALBA
Well. Strictly speaking, Magnus isn’t an employee.
PEARCEY
Oh? Are you a volunteer?
ALBA
Magnus is doing community service here on the orders of His Majesty. Serving three consecutive sentences for various crimes.
MAGNUS
“Crimes”. I knocked over a tent.
ALBA
Very nearly killing dozens.
PEARCEY
This is clearly a big topic! Let’s talk about this when we get to the Stage Two evaluation.
MAGNUS
Bring it on.
Holly is still reading the index. She turns a page.
HOLLY
Wait. There’s a filing system for baked goods?
PEARCEY
And Ms. Salix? How would you describe the House of Healing?
ALBA
It’s a house where we heal people.
PEARCEY
I like that. Straight to the point. It’s a good reminder to stick to our core mission.
ALBA
Yes. So what’s your mission here today?
PEARCEY
This is just a get-to-know-you session. Tomorrow’s when we really start in earnest. I’d like to shadow you throughout a regular day to see how things work around here.
ALBA
Great.
HOLLY
(weakly)
Yay!
INT. EXAM ROOM—NEXT MORNING
Alba is seeing T’Horxa, a weedy would-be adventurer wearing a helmet. In the background, a pen can be heard scratching away at high speed.
ALBA
And what seems to be the problem, Mister… T’Horxa?
T’HORXA
T’Horxa the Invincible! Defeater of evil, bringer of harmony and niceness.
ALBA
Yes. I’m sure your exploits are many and legendary.
T’HORXA
So legendary. Just, um… quick question. Who’s this?
ALBA
This is Ms. Pearcey—
The writing stops. It’s Pearcey.
PEARCEY
Please, just pretend I’m not here. I’m monitoring the treatment to help the House of Healing team improve the patient experience.
T’HORXA
So… you’re not a doctor?
PEARCEY
Don’t worry. All of this is completely confidential. Nothing in these notes will personally identify you.
ALBA
As I was saying, what can we help you with today?
T’HORXA
I’m… uh… T’Horxa is embarrassed to say.
ALBA
Something to do with your helmet, perhaps?
T’HORXA
My helmet? No. I mean… nay. I am here because of a blight upon my face.
ALBA
Caused by your helmet.
PEARCEY
That seems like a rather hasty conclusion at this stage, don’t you think?
ALBA
I thought you weren’t here.
T’HORXA
What’s wrong with my helmet?
ALBA
Let’s see. Did you happen to buy it for an unbelievable price some time yesterday?
T’HORXA
(he so did)
Uh… this helm was forged by the dwarves of… Laggity-Blaggity.
ALBA
And you acquired it from a bold knight with a name like… Galitus?
T’HORXA
Nay…
PEARCEY
Ms. Salix, we’re really diverging from our client intake protocol.
ALBA
Yes we are, because I’ve seen this exact helmet before. Mister T’Horxa, can you take it off, please?
T’HORXA
Does she really have to be here? Writing down everything?
ALBA
Apparently.
PEARCEY
These are simply notes on how our staff perform.
T’HORXA
(reluctant)
T’Horxa consents.
He takes off the helmet.
ALBA
As I thought. You’ve been cursed, I’m afraid.
PEARCEY
Cursed?
T’HORXA
Cursed?
ALBA
A spectral concentrator, to be precise.
PEARCEY
You’re not going to run any tests?
ALBA
We saw a patient yesterday who got himself into trouble with a clan of dwarves, and they gave him this very helmet. It seems to have made its way to Mister T’Horxa here, and affected him in exactly the same way.
PEARCEY
I would have thought you’d test for sensitivity to metal, for changes in diet…
ALBA
Look, I’ll show you. Magnus!
(to T’Horxa)
No, leave the bloody helmet off.
Magnus enters.
MAGNUS
Sup, witches? Oh, look, it’s a knight with a helmet. And a rash.
ALBA
Orb of Hydrogenes?
MAGNUS
Why, I just so happen to have it right here.
PEARCEY
That’s convenient.
MAGNUS
You don’t forget a helmet like that.
T’HORXA
Uh… thanks?
Magnus waves the Orb. It shimmers in much the same way as before.
MAGNUS
Yup, still cursed.
ALBA
Who’d have thunk. Holly!
PEARCEY
Ms. Salix, I don’t believe Magnus is certified to operate magical equipment.
MAGNUS
What? I do it all the time.
T’HORXA
Not certified?
PEARCEY
All Ministry personnel who use magical items or spells must undergo a one-day safety training, unless they’ve graduated from an approved school of magic.
MAGNUS
Really? If I take the training, does that mean I can use any magical equipment here?
ALBA
No.
PEARCEY
No. Basic gear only.
MAGNUS
Dangit.
ALBA
Would you go and find Holly, please?
MAGNUS
Fine.
He leaves.
T’HORXA
So… he’s not supposed to use that glowy thing?
ALBA
The Orb is just a diagnostic tool. Hell, it’s safer than most of the surgical gear we use.
PEARCEY
Yes. Thank you for reminding me—that will be a separate training course.
She makes a note. Holly bustles in.
HOLLY
Hi everybody! What’s up, Alba?
ALBA
The cursed helmet has struck again.
HOLLY
I heard! Lucky I made too much of that salve yesterday.
PEARCEY
What salve would this be?
HOLLY
Penroth’s Chickweed and Revolting Violet. I came up with it myself!
PEARCEY
So this wasn’t a previously documented remedy.
HOLLY
Nope. The violet cancels out residual energy from the curse, see, and—
PEARCEY
Has it been through clinical trials?
HOLLY
Of course! I always taste as I go. Plus we gave it to Sir Galitus yesterday.
PEARCEY
And you’ve booked a follow-up appointment with him to evaluate the results?
ALBA
I don’t expect he’ll be back this way any time soon.
PEARCEY
(sighs)
So you have an effective sample size of one. Ms. Salix, this isn’t good.
HOLLY
I’m telling you, it’s perfectly safe.
T’HORXA
Uh, perhaps T’Horxa should go.
ALBA
Sit. Down.
T’HORXA
Okay.
PEARCEY
How was this solution stored?
HOLLY
In a bowl. Don’t worry! It’s still good! Here, do you want me to test it now? Let’s test it!
She dabs some salve on herself.
ALBA AND PEARCEY
Holly!
HOLLY
It’s all good. See? Ooh, tingly. That’s how you know it’s working. Now, Mister T’Horxa, just hold still and close your eyes.
T’HORXA
T’Horxa is not on board with this!
All hell breaks loose. Everyone is speaking at once:
HOLLY
No, no, it’s safe! Watch, Ms. Pearcey! You’ll see! Stop moving, I don’t want to get it in your eyes!
ALBA
Holly, stop it. Put the salve down! I’m sorry about this, Mister T’Horxa. Holly!
PEARCEY
Holly, that solution is not approved. Everyone, calm down. Ms. Salix, get her to stop.
T’HORXA
No! No! I don’t want tingly stuff on my face! Help! Aaa! It burns! Aaaa!
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFICE
Tense silence.
PEARCEY
(sighs)
Well. I must say—
HOLLY
I’m so sorry, Ms. Pearcey. It’s all my fault.
ALBA
It’s fine, Holly.
PEARCEY
No, it is not. It is not “fine”. Ms. Salix, in the space of a single morning, you and your team have operated magical items without proper training; leapt to fanciful conclusions without any sort of standard diagnostic questionnaire; used an untested, improperly stored remedy against the stated wishes of the patient which caused a significant skin reaction…
MAGNUS
(snickers)
PEARCEY
…due to a hazardous ingredient mixed in by a staff member as a prank.
MAGNUS
Hey, I didn’t think Holly was going to use that stuff on any more patients. But sometimes she drinks the leftovers—see?
HOLLY
Magnus!
MAGNUS
I was trying to teach her a lesson about safe disposal of medicines. I am helping to improve our team’s compliance. Boom.
PEARCEY
Stop digging, young man. You’re already in over your head.
ALBA
All right. Thank you, Minister. Are we done here?
PEARCEY
I am recommending to His Majesty that you, Ms. Salix, attend a six-week course in standard Ministry protocol and procedure…
ALBA
For heaven’s sake.
PEARCEY
…and that your two assistants be let go, effective immediately.
HOLLY
What?!
MAGNUS
Ohhh, you’re kidding. Sweet freedom!
ALBA
You’ll be going back to jail.
MAGNUS
After working here I should get off with time served.
ALBA
Take it up with the King.
HOLLY
We can do better, Ms. Pearcey! I promise we can! Upon my honour—
PEARCEY
Enough! All of you.
ALBA
No.
PEARCEY
Excuse me?
ALBA
No. This is my team. They may not live up to your vision of a perfect, efficient department—
PEARCEY
They don’t live up to my vision of a stampede in a barnyard.
ALBA
Too bad. When they don’t have a… well-meaning bureaucrat second-guessing their every move, they do just fine.
I will take full responsibility for what happened to Mister T’Horxa. You’re right—we rushed the diagnosis because I wanted to get this exercise over with. And maybe look a little bit impressive.
Yes. We’re here to heal people, not because we want to show off or look good.
MAGNUS
Well—
ALBA
Shut it, Magnus. We will begin implementing the new Ministry guidelines. But let’s get one thing straight. This is still my House of Healing. Barnyard or not, I will run it as I see fit.
PEARCEY
Very well. Let me be clear. You’re part of my ministry now. And I expect your House of Healing and all your staff to meet or exceed our standard. You have a week to produce an action plan. We’ll reassess then.
ALBA
Yes. Thank you, Minister.
PEARCEY
(under her breath)
The wizards were bad enough.
Pearcey strides out. The door slams behind her.
HOLLY
Wow, Alba!
MAGNUS
That was so good. You totally should have said “Off with her head!”
HOLLY
You did it! We’re still a team!
ALBA
A team with twenty-one volumes of guidelines to read.
HOLLY
We can do this. Let’s show Ms. Pearcey how good we really are!
ALBA
Please don’t say that.

Hey, hallo, bonjour! It’s Eli, your co-writer and co-producer. We wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who’s been sharing the show out there on social media, playing it for a friend, all that stuff. We’re so glad to know you’re enjoying the show. It really does make our day.

It is a witty and delightful audio drama podcast about an exclusive agency whose job it is to help their clients fake their deaths and start a new life somewhere else.

MUSIC STING
INT. MINISTRY OFFICE
A clock ticks steadily in the background. A big wooden door opens, and Loria Berenice enters the room.
LORIA
(warmly)
Good morning, Madam Minister.
PEARCEY
(stern)
Good morning, Ms Berenice.
Do you have our presentation to the Chancellor ready for this afternoon?
LORIA
Good to go. No preamble, like you said—we’ll just bury him in numbers until he begs for mercy.
PEARCEY
And gives us our budget, I hope.
And remind me, what’s this morning?
Loria searches through a messy pile of papers and books.
LORIA
Uh… This morning… is… inspection at the House of Healing.
PEARCEY
Ah yes. The jewel in the crown of this department.
LORIA
And they should be getting their new secure storage unit installed today too.
PEARCEY
What time?
LORIA
The best I could get out of Magic Support was “some time between ten A.M. and six P.M.”
PEARCEY
(sighs)
As always. All right. I’m off to the House of Healing.
She rises and begins putting on her coat.
LORIA
Shall I bring you the whip, Minister?
PEARCEY
Hmm. No, make it a cudgel. Something that lands on a skull with a nice solid thunk.
LORIA
Of course. Who knows? Maybe they’ll actually be ready for you this time.
PEARCEY
They’d better be.
OPENING THEME

By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician, Volume Two! Episode the Second: Tried and Tested.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTION
HOLLY
(singing)
The laundry’s done and the beds are made!
ALBA
Thank you, Holly.
(calls)
Magnus? How’s the lab coming?
MAGNUS
(from the back hallway)
Just putting away the glassware now. Whoops!
He drops a beaker, which smashes.
ALBA AND HOLLY
Magnus!
Magnus starts sweeping up.
MAGNUS
It’s okay, it’s okay—that was a bad beaker. Very unfit for inspection. It had like, stains… and totally would not pass muster with Minister Fearsome.
ALBA
If you call her that to her face I will hit you—
MAGNUS
Uh-uh! No physical assault on colleagues, remember?
ALBA
Damn these new rules.
Magnus enters the reception area, dusting off his hands.
MAGNUS
All right. Lab’s all done.
ALBA
And the back hallway?
MAGNUS
And the back hallway. Oh. Also, nobody open the right-hand supply cupboard.
HOLLY
My right or your right?
MAGNUS
Holly, don’t open any of the supply cupboards.
HOLLY
Check.
The front door opens.
PEARCEY
Good morning, everyone.
ALBA MAGNUS AND HOLLY
Good morning, Ms Pearcey.
MAGNUS
So, are we all fired yet?
PEARCEY
No. No one’s being fired, oddly enough. Thank you for your efforts in adhering to the new Ministry guidelines. I know this can’t be easy.
ALBA
And the action plan?
PEARCEY
Yes! Very impressive! Very… thorough.
ALBA
You sound surprised.
PEARCEY
You were here when I visited last week, weren’t you?
ALBA
I suppose that’s fair.
PEARCEY
No, compared to the Sorceror General’s staff, the House of Healing runs like gnomish clockwork.
HOLLY
Aw, thank you, Ms Pearcey!
ALBA
Would you like a tour? You can see which items we’ve gotten done so far.
PEARCEY
Gotten done? You’ve actually done things? My word. You’re leaving those wizards in the dust.
ALBA
Holly?
HOLLY
You got it! So this is the reception area…
PEARCEY
I’m familiar, yes.
HOLLY
We’ve cleaned up and moved the desk so it’s easier to get past…
PEARCEY
I saw the new ramp at the front doorstep too, very good.
Holly leads everyone through from room to room.
HOLLY
Through here, the exam room has new easy-to-clean curtains. The lab’s been tidied, cabinets labeled…
MAGNUS
(under his breath)
No, not, not that cupboard…
HOLLY
Glassware and instruments cleaned.
PEARCEY
Good work.
MAGNUS
You bet.
ALBA
Everything’s a bit crowded in here today, unfortunately, but that’s because…
They continue on. The pantry is empty and echoey.
ALBA
The pantry’s been cleared out to make room for the new storage unit.
PEARCEY
They should be delivering it today, in fact.
HOLLY
(sighs)
I’ll miss you, pantry.
ALBA
I know you will. But it’s for safety.
HOLLY
I know.
PEARCEY
How is the one in your office working out?
ALBA
Oh, the cabinet is great. It’s such a relief, finally having all the dangerous magical items protected from unauthorized access.
MAGNUS
Why is everyone looking at me?
ALBA
No reason.
HOLLY
I know why we’re doing it. But I’ll miss all my bottles and jars. I won’t get to write out all the names by hand.
A moment. Alba and Pearcey at a loss.
HOLLY
And… I guess I’m still sad about the garden.
ALBA
I know.
PEARCEY
The garden?
ALBA
A couple of days ago, something came and ate nearly every flower in the herb garden. So we’ve got some replanting to do. And when we bottle the new plants, you can decorate the labels.
HOLLY
Really? Can I? Is that all right, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCEY
(reluctant)
Yes. Fine.
HOLLY
Yay! Thank you!
(pulling up short)
Right, sorry, no hugs.
They continue across the hallway.
PEARCEY
Hmm. Not so good. The hallway is still impassable.
HOLLY
This is just temporary. This will all go into the new unit.
PEARCEY
All right.
MAGNUS
At least the rakes and buckets are gone.
HOLLY
In here, the ward has been swept, scrubbed, smudged and sanitized. We’ve ordered new linens for both beds.
PEARCEY
Very good.
HOLLY
And I think that’s all for inside.
MAGNUS
Yeah, that’s it for inside…
They all return to the exam room.
PEARCEY
Yes. Magnus, you raised the issue of living conditions, and we agree, it would be better to house you somewhere other than…
MAGNUS
A freezing, moldy toolshed?
ALBA
There isn’t any mold.
PEARCEY
We will begin looking for a suitable room within walking distance.
MAGNUS
Define “walking distance”.
PEARCEY
Point seven five miles, or the distance walkable by the average adult in fifteen minutes.
MAGNUS
So… if I find something cheaper further out, can I take a carriage to work?
PEARCEY
Moving right along.
MAGNUS
I mean, you get a carriage.
PEARCEY
Defining roles. We need to assess each of your strengths, and determine where we have gaps to fill.
HOLLY
(hand up)
Ooh. Ooh.
PEARCEY
Yes, Holly.
HOLLY
I’ve been reading about the Persimmon Personality Index!
PEARCEY
I haven’t heard of that one.
HOLLY
At the market the other day, there was a booth for Persimmon Personnel. They do hiring for all those big new companies in town.
PEARCEY
Oh, one of those.
HOLLY
And they created this test, so we can find out what kind of personality and working habits we all have!
ALBA
I don’t think we need a test to tell us that.
Holly has pulled out a cloth bag from under the counter.
HOLLY
They gave me the whole package. Look!
“Know Thyself—Know Thy Employees.” There’s a gem… and a deck of cards… and they’re all different personality archetypes! Don’t you want to know if you’re the Queen of Rubies or the Fire-Eater?
PEARCEY
I’m quite sure this isn’t on the list of approved evaluation tools.
HOLLY
C’mon, it’ll be so perfect. We can discover our unique strengths—in a fun way! Find out what part of our bodies our brains are in!
MAGNUS
Uh…
PEARCEY
Then by all means, try it and see what results you get. On your own time, please.
HOLLY
You have to do it too! Fair’s fair! We want to know your personality, so we know how you like to work and how best to set you up for success in this important transition. What do you think, Alba?
ALBA
I think it’s up to Ms Pearcey.
HOLLY
Please, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCEY
Holly—
HOLLY
Pleeeease?
MAGNUS
I find it’s best just to go with it? Otherwise we’ll be here all day.
PEARCEY
I’m going to regret this. All right, let’s see what we get.
HOLLY
(a delighted squeak)
MUSIC STING
INT. OFFICE—MONTAGE
HOLLY
Alba, I want you to look into this sapphire.
ALBA
Really?
HOLLY
It helps to focus your mental waveform.
ALBA
As if there were any such thing.
HOLLY
Just enjoy how pretty and shiny it is. Admire it. Let your conscious mind drift peacefully as you gaze… into the soothing blue depths of… the sapphire…
She falls silent.
ALBA
And at some point I suppose you ask some questions? Holly? Holly.
HOLLY
Right! Questions.
MUSIC STING
HOLLY
On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being “completely answer A” and ten being “completely answer B”… Would you say that you are more like a pond or a brick wall?
PEARCEY
What does that even mean?
HOLLY
Just pick one! Go with your instinct.
PEARCEY
My instinct is no. Neither.
HOLLY
All right! I’ll say that’s a five.
PEARCEY
How many questions are there?
MUSIC STING
HOLLY
The key is not to overthink your answer. Just say the first thing that comes into your head.
MAGNUS
This is so boring.
HOLLY
Magnus!
MAGNUS
That was the first thing that came into my head.
HOLLY
Magnus. On a scale of zero to ten…
MAGNUS
Seven?
HOLLY
Let me ask the question first!
MAGNUS
…point nine.
HOLLY
Question one.
MAGNUS
Can I say seven point eight three? I’m feeling precise today.
HOLLY
Rrrgh!
MUSIC STING
HOLLY
Would you describe yourself as a catalyst or an observer?
PEARCEY
(utterly checked out)
Five.
Holly writes this down.
HOLLY
Do you prefer to set your own hours, or to think about things that could have been?
PEARCEY
Five.
HOLLY
Do you prefer going to a party or falling from a great height?
PEARCEY
Five. No, ten.
HOLLY
Which of these two circles makes you feel more envious?
MUSIC STING
MAGNUS
I’m not sure I can even put that in a number.
HOLLY
Just say your first response.
MAGNUS
Hmm. Blue.
HOLLY
As a number.
MAGNUS
Maybe bluey-green. With little swirls of white.
HOLLY
Magnus, stop touching the Sapphire of Assessment.
MAGNUS
I’m not touching it! I’m just putting my hand near it as I focus my brainial waveforms on it.
HOLLY
Stop it!
MAGNUS
Look! I’m not even touching it! I’m not! Look!
HOLLY
Magnus!
MUSIC STING
HOLLY
Don’t forget, Alba! Keep looking into the Sapphire.
ALBA
It doesn’t matter where I look.
HOLLY
But it helps to focus the mind.
ALBA
Yes, yes, you’re right.
(under her breath)
I suppose it does keep the violent urges at bay.
HOLLY
Pardon?
ALBA
Nothing, nothing. Three.
MUSIC STING
HOLLY
Question thirty-three. Would you rather try new flavours of pie or climb to the top of the tallest mountain?
Well, pie, obviously.
I’ll put that down as a ten! Question thirty-four. Do you prefer being physically active, or making yourself useful?
Can’t I be both?
Five, then? How about five? Hello?
So shiny…
Holly, please pay attention!
Sorry!
She laughs and laughs.
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTION—CONTINUOUS
Holly is still laughing in the background.
MAGNUS
Welp. This is fun.
PEARCEY
I knew it was a bad idea.
ALBA
It’s all part of a learning process.
PEARCEY
How much longer do you think she’s going to be? Perhaps we can get on with some actual business.
The front door opens, and the bell rings. Travin, an awkward 20-something wizard, enters, wheeling a cart.
TRAVIN
Hey. So. I’m looking for Alba?
ALBA
Yes?
TRAVIN
I’m Travin? I’m from Magic Support. I got your new Secure Storage Unit here.
ALBA
Oh good. Thank you.
MAGNUS
That little thing? How is that gonna hold everything in the pantry?
TRAVIN
Oh, the DragonHoard 3C comes compressed. I’m gonna take it out of the packaging, and it’s gonna expand to fill basically the whole room.
MAGNUS
What! That’s so cool.
TRAVIN
Pantry’s back here?
ALBA
Down the hall on your right. You’ll see it.
MAGNUS
Can I watch?
TRAVIN
Sure.
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING PANTRY—CONTINUOUS
Magnus and Travin wheel the cart down the hall to the pantry and unload a big box.
TRAVIN
Watch out, it’s heavy.
MAGNUS
You’re not kidding!
TRAVIN
So, we just gotta line it up in the very center of the room, so it doesn’t go crooked and damage any walls.
MAGNUS
Right. Makes sense.
TRAVIN
Then just cut this open, slide this off…
He cuts a couple of straps, then pulls away a wooden cover. A soft crackle and hiss, like an air mattress.
MAGNUS
And there it is. How awesome is that?
TRAVIN
Yeah. And now we wait.
MAGNUS
Is it doing anything?
TRAVIN
Takes a while for it to expand to full size.
MAGNUS
Right.
So is this your job, installing these things?
TRAVIN
Any kind of magic fixtures. We got a big project coming up for the Transmutation lab—
Down the hall, the exam room door opens, and Holly emerges. Her voice carries down the hall.
HOLLY
All right, team! Time for our results!
ALBA
Magnus!
MAGNUS
We’re busy!
ALBA
No you’re not. Get in here and get your damn results.
MAGNUS
(sighs)
Fine.
TRAVIN
Trust me, you’re not missing out on anything.
Magnus trudges back to reception.
MAGNUS
(under his breath)
I should have been a wizard. I could totally go to wizard school.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTION
ALBA
All right, let’s get this over with.
PEARCEY
Yes. I’m due at the Chancellor’s office soon.
MAGNUS
Hey, don’t touch the Sapphire of Assessment, Holly.
HOLLY
I’m the one administering the test. I have to hold the Sapphire to my head like this while I choose the cards. It helps amplify my mental vibrations.
MAGNUS
(snickers)
HOLLY
Who wants to go first?
Silence.
MAGNUS
Fine, I’ll go. This better be good, Holly.
HOLLY
It’s not good or bad. There’s no judgement. It’s a reflection of your true inner self.
MAGNUS
So, like, the King of Hellfire.
Holly turns up a card.
HOLLY
The Princeling of Waters.
MAGNUS
“Princeling”? Seriously?
HOLLY
He’s got a nice hat!
MAGNUS
Aw, man… Even the picture makes him look like a dork. I pronounce your test officially lame.
HOLLY
(reads)
Um… “This card signifies a rebellious spirit who questions authority at every turn.”
ALBA
Well.
MAGNUS
(suddenly liking this)
Tell me more of this fascinating result.
HOLLY
“They struggle against the system and are often resourceful and inventive, even though…”
MAGNUS
…their genius goes unappreciated?
HOLLY
“…they may appear opportunistic and lazy.”
MAGNUS
To the uneducated layperson. Go back to the part about fighting the system?
PEARCEY
I’d hoped the point of this test was to find ways to channel your strengths into positive results for the team.
HOLLY
That’s right.
MAGNUS
No way, baby. I’m sticking it to the man!
ALBA
Yes, you’re quite the rebel.
MAGNUS
You know it.
HOLLY
Okay! Let’s do yours, Alba.
ALBA
All right.
Holly shuffles and deals.
MAGNUS
My money’s on The Old Maid. Of Broomsticks. Or the Tyrant. Is there a Tyrant?
HOLLY
No, it looks like—oh my gosh! The Princeling of Waters.
ALBA
Really.
MAGNUS
What? That’s my card! She can’t have mine!
PEARCEY
That is an amusing coincidence.
HOLLY
Oh, it’s not a coincidence!
MAGNUS
Clearly your cards are stuck or something.
ALBA
I suspect improper shuffling.
PEARCEY
Perhaps the two of you have more in common than you think.
MAGNUS
Like heck.
ALBA
Gods help me.
HOLLY
That’s so interesting…
PEARCEY
Alba, you were a little bit of a terror in your school days, I hear.
ALBA
People say the damnedest things, don’t they?
HOLLY
It’s true, though! Alba, you are resourceful and inventive, and you don’t listen to authority much.
PEARCEY
This will be interesting when we talk about work habits and interpersonal strategies.
ALBA
I’m curious to see what card you get, Ms Pearcey.
PEARCEY
Yes, all right.
MAGNUS
Nobody else better get Princeling of Waters.
Holly deals out another card.
HOLLY
No! It’s The Scribe. “A figure who maintains rational order and values competence, honesty and reliability.” Right? That’s so you!
PEARCEY
(warming to it)
I suppose that’s not a bad description.
HOLLY
“A keeper of knowledge…”
PEARCEY
Hmm! Fair enough.
HOLLY
“…and a keeper of secrets.”
ALBA
Secrets?
HOLLY
Ooh, that sounds mysterious.
PEARCEY
(hastily)
It just means that I’m trustworthy, obviously, and am often privy to official secrets by virtue of my position.
HOLLY
(lightly)
You don’t have any deep, dark secrets, Ms Pearcey?
ALBA
Yes, do tell.
PEARCEY
Well!
Holly, let’s find out what personality type you are.
HOLLY
Okay!
MAGNUS
Can you trust this test if you ran it on yourself?
ALBA
It’s probably just as useful as everyone else’s results.
Holly turns over a card.
MAGNUS
“The Queen of the Wind”?
HOLLY
Aw, that does sound like me!
She flutters her wings.
MAGNUS
Careful with those wings, O Queen.
HOLLY
Sorry, I just got excited! Let’s see. Oooh! “A spirit with a deep connection to the primal forces of nature.”
ALBA
That’s one way of putting it.
HOLLY
“A dynamic personality…”
(her excitement drains away)
“…who is fated to bring doom and destruction.”
Beat.
MAGNUS
Ha ha!
ALBA
That sounds about right, actually.
HOLLY
No, it can’t be. I’m a good fairy and I help people!
MAGNUS
(mocking laughter)
Bringer of doom!
HOLLY
Magnus, this is me we’re talking about! I’d never bring doom!
MAGNUS
Who almost got us eaten by bears?
HOLLY
That wasn’t my fault! I was starving and they had porridge!
PEARCEY
Bears?
ALBA
I seem to remember a fair number of lab explosions.
HOLLY
Magnus brings on way more doom than I do.
MAGNUS
(scoffs)
PEARCEY
All right. We can’t take this test too seriously. This is simply a mildly entertaining game to spark conversation.
HOLLY
But… I looked into the Sapphire. Do you think it sensed a mental vibration from deep in my spirit that I’ve been hiding from all this time?
ALBA
I think it tells us a lot of random traits that could match anyone.
HOLLY
I’m scared, Ms Pearcey.
MAGNUS
Yeah, I dunno… maybe you should take the rest of the day off. You know, just in case.
HOLLY
In case what?
MAGNUS
In case you have a mental vibration.
HOLLY
You’re a mental vibration.
There’s a crackle, then a huge BLAM! from the pantry.
ALBA
What the hell was that?
HOLLY
Oh no!
Travin appears in the doorway.
TRAVIN
(coughing)
So… slight problem with the install.
ALBA
What happened?
HOLLY
Oh my gosh. It’s happening already.
TRAVIN
I think we might have mis-measured the amount of free space.
PEARCEY
What?! Is anything damaged?
TRAVIN
I mean… little bit. Just might need to get someone in to look at the walls, and make sure they’re still sound.
PEARCEY
This is unacceptable. Show me.
TRAVIN
Well, you know, sometimes these old buildings, they expand and contract with the cold…
Pearcey, Travin and Magnus follow him to the back hallway.
HOLLY
(whispers)
It’s all my fault.
ALBA
Holly…
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING HALLWAY
Dust and debris settle.
PEARCEY
Did you double-check the measurements before you opened the package?
TRAVIN
(guilty)
Yeah!
PEARCEY
Did you?
TRAVIN
I… I mean…
MAGNUS
Yeah, he totally did. I saw him.
PEARCEY
I see.
MAGNUS
Can’t you just shrink it?
PEARCEY
No, he can’t. Once installed, it’s proof against most types of magic. And even if we did shrink it, I don’t trust this building to stay standing now.
TRAVIN
It’s really not that bad.
PEARCEY
I’m going to talk to the head of your department, young man. And they need to get the emergency team down here on the double. Come on, let’s clear the building.
(calls)
Everyone out! Holly? Ms Salix? Hello?
MUSIC STING
EXT. FOREST—DAY
Holly is crouched under a tree. Alba approaches softly.
HOLLY
I’m a monster. I bring doom and destruction everywhere I go.
ALBA
I thought I might find you here.
HOLLY
Alba, no. You can’t be around me. It’s not safe.
ALBA
Holly, you pulled a random card out of a deck.
HOLLY
And then the whole House of Healing nearly fell down!
ALBA
It didn’t. And it certainly wasn’t your fault.
HOLLY
I brought this on us, Alba.
ALBA
You did no such bloody thing. It was that so-called wizard from the Ministry. He didn’t measure properly. He didn’t even install the unit with the door facing out.
You are a good fairy and you help people.
HOLLY
That’s just a thing I say to make myself feel better.
ALBA
It’s true. You are good. You’re good because you care. That’s who you are. That’s something to be proud of.
So take it easy today. Pearcey’s not letting us back in the building anyway. Go get some rest.
HOLLY
Thanks, Alba.
ALBA
See you in the morning.
MUSIC STING
EXT. HOUSE OF HEALING GARDEN—DAY
Magnus and Travin survey the damage.
TRAVIN
They’re being so stupid. The building’s gonna be fine. It’s just a little plaster off the walls.
MAGNUS
I know, right? That Pearcey is such a tightass.
TRAVIN
Yeah. Oh, hey, thanks for covering for me in there.
MAGNUS
You got it, dude. Oh, shoot, that reminds me.
TRAVIN
What’s up?
MAGNUS
While you’re here, Alba wanted me to ask you about a problem with the cabinet in her office.
TRAVIN
That’s the DragonHoard 11S?
MAGNUS
Yeah, the big new shiny red one?
TRAVIN
(sighs)
What’s wrong with it?
MAGNUS
It’s kinda dumb. We forgot the password. You know, we’re supposed to choose one that’s hard to guess, and Pearcey’s all like, “No, you can’t write it down!”
TRAVIN
Well, I mean, that’s good practice, but yeah.
MAGNUS
I wanna say it was something like “double, double, toil and trouble” but it’s not working. Any way you can tell what Alb… what we set it to?
TRAVIN
No, there’s no way to find out. But… if you want, I can reset the password, and you can just choose a new one.
MAGNUS
Really? That would be amazing.
TRAVIN
Oh yeah, it’s no problem.
MAGNUS
You’re saving my life, man. Seriously.
MUSIC STING
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFICE
Magnus hunts through the cabinet.
MAGNUS
Oo, nice wand.
Amulet… boring.
Teapot… lame.
Heyyy, now this looks demonic.
He flips through a book.
MAGNUS
Dammit, I gotta learn me some languages.
Whoa, that’s… graphic. Ugh.
Magnus shuts the book quickly.
He pulls out a big knife and unsheaths it.
MAGNUS
Oh ho ho. You beautiful, beautiful thing.
He swishes it through the air a few times.
MAGNUS
Ohh, that is so cool. Yeah. You probably got a name, like Blade of the Night… Sky Talon… Drinker of Souls.
The blade emits scorching, crackling flames.
MAGNUS
No way! Alba, where did you get this awesome knife?
He swings it around some more, causing great whooshes of flame.
MAGNUS
Aw yeah.
Aw yeah.
And inevitably, sets some of the nearby papers on fire.
MAGNUS
Oh crap. Oh crap crap crap.
He runs around trying to beat out the flames.
MAGNUS
Okay. Okay. Everything’s gonna be fine. It wasn’t even me! I wasn’t even here. Oh gods I’m so dead.
From the next room comes the sound of the front door bell.
MAGNUS
Aaa!
HOLLY
(calls)
Hello? Who’s here?
She runs in just as Magnus puts out the last of the fire.
HOLLY
Magnus! What are you doing in here?
MAGNUS
Me? I’m… Nothing! What are you doing in here?
HOLLY
I saw lights inside and—oh my gosh! What did you do?
MAGNUS
Nothing!
HOLLY
Yeah, right. I knew you’d be up to something.
MAGNUS
What do you mean? I saw the fire too and I came in to fight it.
HOLLY
Why is the red cabinet open?
MAGNUS
Uh… because of the fire, it popped open. Like popcorn.
HOLLY
Uh huh? Who’s causing doom and destruction now?
MAGNUS
The fire’s out! There was hardly any destruction.
HOLLY
Except for Alba’s papers.
MAGNUS
I know. Oh geez. You gotta help me hide them.
HOLLY
No! We have to get out of here! The building’s not safe.
MAGNUS
Travin says the building is totally fine.
HOLLY
Like he’d know.
MAGNUS
He’s a wizard. He knows stuff.
HOLLY
Magnus, just close the cabinet and let’s go.
There’s a faint tapping sound.
MAGNUS
Wait. What’s that noise?
HOLLY
Magnus, leave it!
MAGNUS
It’s coming from inside this bag.
He picks up a heavy cloth bag and opens it. The tapping turns into fluttering: something small battering its wings against the inside of a glass jar.
HOLLY
Stop touching things! Do you want to bring doom and—aww, it’s a little butterfly!
MAGNUS
Holly…
HOLLY
Oh no, he’s stuck. Well, thank goodness we got that fire put out. He could have been killed!
MAGNUS
Holly, why does Alba have a butterfly in a jar? In a bag? In the back of a magic-proof locked cabinet?
HOLLY
Exactly. I’m going to have a word with her when she comes back. Look at his tiny face! He’s so sad.
MAGNUS
But don’t you think he might be dangerous too? Or is Alba secretly evil?
HOLLY
He’s just a butterfly. Just hang on, little guy.
MAGNUS
How do you even know it’s a he?
HOLLY
My people train butterflies.
MAGNUS
To do what? Harvest nectar? Carry flower petals?
HOLLY
On Midsummer’s Day they dance! You should see it—fairies and butterflies turning the sky into fountains of colour!
MAGNUS
…Right.
HOLLY
Here you go, buddy. You’re free!
She opens the lid. A tiny patter of feet on the glass.
MAGNUS
You gonna dance for us, Mister Butterfly?
BUTTERFLY
(a tiny, growling voice)
No.
Shocked silence.
MAGNUS
You talk?
HOLLY
Oh my gosh, you do talk. Hello! My name’s Holly.
BUTTERFLY
I will not dance for you, Holly.
HOLLY
That’s okay! You don’t have to.
BUTTERFLY
The two of you are going to dance for me.
MAGNUS
Shyeah right. Last animal who told me to dance, I got out a shovel and I—
He’s cut short by a blast of lighting.
MAGNUS
OW! Holy dangit it to heck in a—ow!
Tiny fluttering wings. Another blast.
BUTTERFLY
Dance, human! Come on! Ha ha ha ha!
MAGNUS
Aaa! Stop that! Holly!
HOLLY
It’s okay, Mister Butterfly!
MAGNUS
Get this thing away from me!
HOLLY
Magnus, be nice! He’s not a “thing”.
MAGNUS
He shoots lightning!
HOLLY
He’s just disoriented.
MAGNUS
Lightning, Holly!
BUTTERFLY
Did I hear right, fairy? You enslave my people?
HOLLY
What? We don’t enslave! It’s artistic collaboration!
BUTTERFLY
Lies!
Another crackle of lightning.
HOLLY
Aaa! That’s not nice. I just rescued you!
MAGNUS
Yeah, what were you doing in that jar, anyway?
BUTTERFLY
She imprisoned me. The human hag. Said she didn’t want me in her garden. She would have me go hungry, she would!
HOLLY
What? No! We have plenty of nice flowers you can drink from. Or… we did until yesterday, anyway.
BUTTERFLY
Drink from the flowers? Oh no. Nectar is sweet. But now I feed on something far sweeter—pure beauty!
MAGNUS
What does that mean?
HOLLY
It was you that ate all the flowers?
BUTTERFLY
(chuckles)
Oh, they were delicious. And all the lovely shiny beetles and ladybugs…
HOLLY
(gasps)
MAGNUS
Since when do butterflies eat ladybugs?
BUTTERFLY
I would have had that pretty little bunny rabbit, too, if that evil witch hadn’t caught me.
MAGNUS
You? Eat a bunny rabbit? I’d like to see that.
The butterfly gives a monstrous screech.
HOLLY
Eeek!
MAGNUS (SIMULTANEOUS)
Whoa! Whoa, teeth!
BUTTERFLY
That could be arranged.
MAGNUS
Nope! Nope, don’t need to see that!
HOLLY
You ate Alba’s flowers and herbs and all the little bugs, and she’s the evil one? I don’t think so!
The butterfly flaps about, gnashing his sharp teeth.
BUTTERFLY
Soon I shall feast upon her bones. But first, I shall feast upon yours, fairy!
A flash of lighting.
MAGNUS
Whoa! Help! Fire!
BUTTERFLY
I shall drink your tears.
HOLLY
Stop it!
BUTTERFLY
Fear me! I am Pelipaghh the Devourer!
HOLLY
Yeah, well, I’m… I’m Holly, the Queen of the Wind!
Holly’s voice grows low and fierce as she takes to the air too. Wind howls around her, and lightning scorches the room.
BUTTERFLY
I do not fear the little minions of the witch.
HOLLY
We’re not minions! We’re staff!
BUTTERFLY
You serve her whims.
HOLLY
Come here, you!
Another bolt of lightning.
BUTTERFLY
Ha ha ha!
HOLLY
Get back in your jar!
The wind grows louder.
MAGNUS
Holly! What the heck? Are you doing that?
The butterfly screams in terror as he is swept into the middle of a whirlwind.
BUTTERFLY
Aaaaa! No! Let me go!
HOLLY
(low and terrifying)
I am Queen of the Wind. I bring doom and destruction! Starting with you!
BUTTERFLY
Noooo!
MAGNUS
Holly!
HOLLY
Magnus, get the jar.
MAGNUS
Right. Right.
BUTTERFLY
Aaaaaa!
The whirlwind deposits the frantic butterfly in the jar, which Magnus quickly corks.
MAGNUS
Got him. Thank the gods. Here. One evil butterfly.
HOLLY
Say you’re sorry!
BUTTERFLY
(panting, defeated)
I will not! Filthy fairy!
HOLLY
Say it!
BUTTERFLY
No! You can imprison me but you can never—aaaaaa!
Holly shakes the jar, rattling the butterfly around inside. She laughs madly.
BUTTERFLY
Okay, okay! I’m sorry! Aaa!
MAGNUS
Whoa, whoa, let’s all calm down. Queen of the Wind, I got it.
HOLLY
What’s that? I can’t hear you!
BUTTERFLY
I’m sorry! Uncle!
MAGNUS
Holly, why don’t we, uh, just put him back in the cabinet?
BUTTERFLY
Yeah. Yeah. I’ll go back in the cabinet. It’s good. I’ll be good.
Still breathing hard from the fight, Holly and Magnus stuff the jar back into the bag and shut it back in the cabinet.
MAGNUS
That was amazing, Holly. I didn’t know you could do that.
HOLLY
(softly)
Neither did I. Gosh.
MAGNUS
Totally badass.
HOLLY
Thanks.
(she takes a deep breath and lets it out)
Wow.
Something tinkles to the floor.
MAGNUS
So dead.

She pulls out a heavy book and flips through it as Holly bursts in.
HOLLY
Hey Alba! We’ve been summoned to the Palace.
ALBA
Is it Her Majesty again?
HOLLY
Yup! Time to check on the royal baby.
ALBA
Which sadly means we have to check on the royal mother-to-be. And I was so looking forward to curling up with these interior signage regulations. All right.
Alba tosses the book down.

(blearily, from under a desk)
What!?
HOLLY
I’ll get your house call bag.
ALBA
Thanks.
She pushes her chair back and stands.
MAGNUS
Ow….
ALBA
Where’s Magnus?
HOLLY
(suddenly dark)
WHO CARES.
(chipper again)
I mean… No, I haven’t seen him all morning!
ALBA
Dammit. Magnus!
MAGNUS
Yes, your Loudness. What is it.
ALBA
Why are you under the desk?
MAGNUS
It’s not my fault. It was those damn fairies… and all their prancing…
ALBA
I need you to cover reception, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Can’t we just close for the day?
ALBA
No, we can’t. What’s wrong with you now?
Holly comes back in with a bag.
HOLLY
Oh, look, there he is.
Magnus came with me to the fairy circle celebration last night!
ALBA
Magnus did?
HOLLY
Yes! He ate all the fairy cakes…
MAGNUS
Well, you guys should have stopped me.
HOLLY
(still smiling)
And then he made fun of everyone, knocked over one of the stones and threw up on my friend Starlight.
MAGNUS
Ughhh. My head hurts.
HOLLY
It serves you right!
ALBA
Magnus, pull yourself together. Holly and I are off to the Palace.
MAGNUS
All right, all right, all right. I got it. I’ll hold down the fort.
ALBA
Thank you.
HOLLY
Yay! You’re going to be an auntie, Alba. Again!
Alba and Holly hurry out. Magnus slumps into a chair.

Parabel’s footsteps.
ALBA
I can’t examine you if you keep pacing like that.
PARABEL
I think better when I am pacing.
ALBA
Well, if you pace less, you might think less, and it might spare us from any more decrees about pink buildings. Sit. Holly?
HOLLY
Pink is nice!
ALBA
I meant, bring me the Sceptre of Sanela.
HOLLY
Oh right. You got it.
PARABEL
Your snide remarks aside… it’s good you are here. I’ve been thinking about how to serve those in need. How the few must sacrifice so that the many might flourish.
ALBA
(under her breath)
Artena, grant me strength.
PARABEL
How the poor, grubby masses rely on us for their guidance and safety.
ALBA
Mm hmmm.
HOLLY
Here you go, Alba.
PARABEL
How one Queen must rise above her people.
ALBA
Well, you’ve got that part down.
Sound of magic building.
PARABEL
Yes. I have risen to what my station demands of me. With this crown comes great responsibili—ouch!
The magic cuts off with a crackle.
ALBA
Hold still!
PARABEL
I’ve been holding still for you all morning! I need an answer.
ALBA
We’re not calling a coin toss here. It’s complicated at the best of times. And the earlier we do it, the less reliable the scrying.
PARABEL
The scry-ing or the scry-er?
ALBA
(mutters)
Well, Your Majesty’s temperament is completely normal.
PARABEL
What was that?
ALBA
Your humours are as well balanced as ever, your Majesty.
PARABEL
I should hire a proper physician.
I need to know if my child is a boy or a girl.
ALBA
All the readings so far are somewhere in the middle. It could be either. Or neither. Which is why we need to recalibrate the Sceptre. It’s a very sensitive piece of—
Another rush of magic. Part of the sceptre falls off and clatters on the floor.
HOLLY
I’m sorry, Alba! It’s like it jumped out of my hand.
ALBA
It’s fine. Just bring me the backup calibrator from the bag.
PARABEL
I’ll cancel my next appointment, shall I?
HOLLY
Here you go, Alba.
Magic builds and then dies with a clunk.
ALBA
Oh, now what?
PARABEL
Well?
A clicking sound.
HOLLY
I just charged it!
PARABEL
(stands)
Enough. I need to know the sex of this child, Alba.
ALBA
Yes, yes. There’s so much planning to do for the baby shower.
PARABEL
(paces to the window)
You don’t know the half of it.
ALBA
Holly, hold the sceptre. I’m going to replace the power stone.
HOLLY
Holding on!
PARABEL
(alone, gripping the windowsill)
I see it coming. A darkness that consumes everything it touches. Kingdom by kingdom it stalks us. Until only we remain, blissfully ignorant as the mouse before the cobra strikes. Their puppet prince hungry to rule and no legitimate heir in sight…
A snap and a shower of sparks.
ALBA
Dammit!
HOLLY
Oh my gosh.
All our equipment is failing. It’s like the baby doesn’t want us to know.
ALBA
It’s an embryo, Holly, not a sorcerer.
All right, let’s do this the old-fashioned way.
HOLLY
A resonating salve?
ALBA
Yes.
Parabel, the salve we’re going to use tests the physical signs only, so it’s not always reliable at this stage—and you’re not even listening.
PARABEL
Can you see them, sister? My subjects. How they scurry to attend to their duty, ignorant of the predator watching from the shadows. Such mindless little things, grovelling before their queen like… like ants, with those horrid little antenna things.
ALBA
I thought we were mice.
PARABEL
Ugh!
HOLLY
(whispers)
Alba, human babies don’t have antennae, do they?
ALBA
Not typically.
HOLLY
Oh. Phew! I thought I’d missed something.
ALBA
Lie back, please, Your Majesty. And hold the royal garments up over your belly, thank you.
Holly opens a bottle.
HOLLY
Sorry, Your Majesty. I didn’t have time to warm the salve up.
PARABEL
It’s no matter.
(a sharp breath in)
A shimmer of magic, more subtle and stable.
HOLLY
Oh, wow. It’s starting to glow already!
ALBA
So it is.
Well, Your Majesty, you can break out the fireworks and the good napkins.
PARABEL
It’s… good news?
HOLLY
Hooray!
ALBA
It’s a boy.
PARABEL
What?!
ALBA
As I said, it’s not one hundred percent reliable at this stage, but it appears your baby is male in body, with all the dangling bits required by ancient custom to profess your child an heir to the throne.
PARABEL
No. No!
HOLLY
Your Majesty!
PARABEL
Get away from me.
HOLLY
I’m so sorry! Do you want a towel for the salve?
Parabel snatches the towel from Holly.
PARABEL
Alba. Listen to me. You must help me to hide this and speak of this to no one.
ALBA
I know you had your heart set on having a third daughter of a third daughter of a third daughter. But for heaven’s sake—
PARABEL
For once in your misspent life, listen to me! Our kingdom hangs by a thread! We must hide the sex of this child from everyone, forever!
ALBA
What kind of life is that going to be? Parabel, come on. Sit down. Would you like a sedative? Holly, get a sedative.
PARABEL
Ha! I’m just hysterical, is that it, sister?
ALBA
Parabel, what’s gotten into you?
PARABEL
Only concern for my child and my people.
Scurry elsewhere. You are dismissed!
Parabel flows out of the room.
ALBA
(sighs)
As usual.

There’s no boats. Sweetie, wake up.
PEARCEY

Pearcey is already up. She runs around the room getting dressed.
PEARCEY

LORIA

PEARCEY

Pearcey pours water into a basin to wash her face.
PEARCEY
Ugh. It’s all the bowing that gets me.
“Ah, Minister, you enlighten us SO with your interesting suggestions.” “Ah Minister, you see with such brilliance and clarity, for a commoner.”
LORIA
Commoner? Did they say that?
PEARCEY
Oh yes. Just yesterday.
They’re all waiting it out, praying that I’m just going to disappear in a puff of smoke. And then they can get back to their incestuous, nepotistic old-wizard-club ways.
LORIA

PEARCEY
I suppose I do.
Who is today’s first audience?
LORIA
Oh… Let me think.
PEARCEY
Or perhaps we should get our little bottom out of bed and check the diary?
LORIA
Well, that’s no fun!
PEARCEY
Exactly. There will be no fun in my department!
She tickles Loria, who springs out of bed.
LORIA
Eek! Help!
(laughing)
No fun! I promise!
Screaming and laughter as Pearcey chases Loria around the room.
LORIA
Okay, okay! I have the diary! Stop!
PEARCEY
And our first audience…?
LORIA
Is… the Office of Dissipation, Viticulture and Profligate Expenditures.
PEARCEY
Well. This has all the tell-tale signs of a truly stupendous day.
LORIA
(in her snooty, professional voice)
Shall I fetch your robes of office?
PEARCEY.
(snooty too)
Yes. And my reading lenses.
And a ledger, doesn’t matter which. I want them to think I’m reviewing their spending.
LORIA
At once, Minister. You enlighten us SO with your wisdom…
PEARCEY
Ms Berenice. Are you making fun?
LORIA
Nope! No fun.
PEARCEY
Oh, and has King Gunther sent word about my request?
LORIA
Which request?
PEARCEY
To hire an additional staff member? You did send it.
LORIA
I think… Oh wait. Yeah, I did!
PEARCEY
Loria.
LORIA
I don’t memorize every note that lands on my desk. If you’re going to be grumpy, you can write your own requests.
She stalks off.
PEARCEY
(takes a deep breath)
I’m sorry, I’m just overwhelmed lately. The King expects me to overhaul a department I know next to nothing about and refuses to send me any assistance.
LORIA
(clears her throat)
PEARCEY
My little L‑Bear, your assistance goes above and beyond the call of duty.
I speak of a need for one with less fire and duller claws.
LORIA
(purrs)
Meow!
PEARCEY
And less temptation! Now get dressed!
A knock at the door.
PEARCEY
Now what?
We follow Pearcey to the front hall. She opens the door.
TRAVIN
Hey…
PEARCEY
Yes? Oh, it’s… Travin, isn’t it?
TRAVIN
Yeah. Hey. Package for you from Magic Support.
PEARCEY
(with withering sarcasm)
Oh good. What new wonder do you have for me today?
TRAVIN
It’s this…
PEARCEY
A rock.
TRAVIN
Plus a note from the king.
PEARCEY
The king? What’s the note?
TRAVIN
Let’s see…
(clears throat)
He unfolds a letter. Crossfade to Gunther as he writes the message at his desk.
TRAVIN AND GUNTHER
“His Majesty King Gunther the Third hereby acknowledges on the 23rd day of this month of the Rooster, that he has received your—”
PEARCEY
Is there any way you might be able to get to the actual message in this message?
TRAVIN
Yeah, sorry.
GUNTHER
Most rude. Where was I? Oh yes.
The Office of Appropriations has come up with a firecracker of an idea: out-sourcing! I believe I have that right. We get the people we need but only pay a fraction of the normal costs. This is a great boon, as now we should be able to afford that state banquet next week. And those dancers from Vanyaco I’ve been so looking forward to.
(clears throat, gets back on track)
With that in mind, please accept this new Spectral Assistant, which I trust will serve you well.
His Royal Majesty, Gunther the Third, King of Farloria and benevolent protector of—
PEARCEY
Yes. Got it. Much obliged. Is he sending someone or not?
TRAVIN
Yeah. That’s what this is.
PEARCEY
This is a rock.
TRAVIN
Yeah, so that’s your Spectral Assistant. The rock is just the hardware. Like, the physical thing it’s bound to.
Silence.
PEARCEY
No. No, we’re done. You and your rock are dismissed.
She starts to shut the door.
TRAVIN
Oh no, c’mon, wait. I’m supposed to deliver this to you. If I don’t, my manager is gonna be on my case.
PEARCEY
Fine. Give it here. Just tell me it’s not going to go haywire and knock down the building.
TRAVIN
Uh… it shouldn’t.
PEARCEY
Good. Thank you.
TRAVIN
You’re welcome, Madam—
Pearcey shuts the door in his face.
LORIA
What is that?
PEARCEY.
Don’t ask.
The calm, even voice of Leon Stamatis (of the podcast Greater Boston) emerges from the rock.
LEON
Ah, good day.
PEARCEY
(screams and drops the rock)
LEON
My name is Leon, and I have been assigned to you by the Incorporeal Workers’ Union as part of my afterlife release program.
LORIA
A talking rock?
PEARCEY
Childish. Do I have Travin to thank for this hilarious joke? Or some other short-sighted, pointy-hatted imbecile?
LEON
I assure you that this is no prank, Minister.
LORIA
You did say you wanted someone solid…
PEARCEY
Don’t you start too. I need dependable assistance, not a rock.
LEON
There is nothing more solid and dependable than a rock. Rocks have stood the test of time, witnessing the rise and fall of countless civilizations. They are the very definition of dependable.
LORIA
Right. So how do you assist?
LEON
This piece of obsidian has been tuned and updated to run Igneous 4.2.1. It acts as an anchor for my Prescient Outsourced Presence.
PEARCEY
No. I don’t have time for this.
LEON
You are correct. I have taken the liberty of updating your schedule accordingly.
PEARCEY
You what?
LEON
Today, 8 to 8:30am.
Finish getting dressed. Smart and formal attire. Consider wearing that new jacket, but settle instead on the robes of office.
9 to 9:45am.
Answer summons from Queen Parabel about state of the kingdom (anticipated).
PEARCEY
The Queen?
LORIA
What?
PEARCEY
“No morning appointments” indeed.
LORIA
You don’t have an appointment with the Queen. I swear!
LEON
11 to 11:15am.
Stop for food in the kitchens on the way to the Wizard’s Council. Council won’t start on time because wizards.
2 to 4pm.
Summon Alba Salix. Skip small talk. Address her team’s failure to meet each and every touchstone. Be firm but understanding. Guide her to an action plan that doesn’t involve murdering members of her staff.
6:30 to 9pm.
Dinner with Loria. Fettucine Portayo and braised Brassica sprouts. Dancing to follow.
LORIA
Hmm!
LEON
9 to 10pm.
Sex with Loria (anticipated). Suggest a “spontaneous” role-play scenario: naughty riding instructor…
LORIA
(bursts out laughing)
PEARCEY
All right! That’s quite enough.
LORIA
Oh, I like this rock.
PEARCEY
Very well. Mister…?
LEON
Leon. Just Leon.
PEARCEY
Mister Leon, I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I’m going to try you out.
(lifts the rock)
Oof. I don’t suppose they make any spectral assistant pebbles?
> MUSIC STING
EXT. ROAD FROM THE PALACE, DAY
Sounds of the town fade into the distance as Alba and Holly walk.
ALBA
We’ll have to replace that sceptre too. Hopefully it’s still under warranty.
HOLLY
Alba… do you think the Queen will be okay?
ALBA
She’ll be fine. It’s the baby I feel sorry for. If anything could mess a kid up more than being raised by Parabel…
HOLLY
Humans get awfully wound up about who’s a girl and who’s a boy.
ALBA
It’s true. She flew completely off the handle when little Coralyn decided she wanted to wear trousers.
HOLLY
Is she right about the Balgomarians, though? If it is a boy, is the baby going to be in danger?
ALBA
Who knows? I doubt it. Her Majesty is always being overdramatic. The Theatre Guild should give her a lifetime achievement award.
HOLLY
(suddenly gasps)
Oh no! Something’s on fire!
ALBA
Exactly. Or “Oh no! Which of my hundred dresses shall I wear?”
HOLLY
No, the House of Healing! I think it’s on fire!
Holly flies off as Alba breaks into a run.
ALBA
What?! Oh gods. What’s that idiot boy done now?
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
A raging fire. The sound of rushing water and bandits yelling and pounding on the far side of an interior door.
BANDITS
Boss! What do we do? Help!
MAGNUS
It’s working. Ha ha, listen to them!
JEROME
I don’t know, Magnus…
MAGNUS
No, no! Jerome, do not get up! We have to keep the door shut!
The pounding grows weaker and stops as the water on the far side of the door rises.
JEROME
We’re not… killing them, are we?
MAGNUS
It’s just a little water. They’re bandits! Brigands! They can swim!
BANDIT 1
(from inside)
Help! I can’t swim!
MAGNUS
Or I guess that’s pirates. Pirates can probably swim.
Alba throws open the front door.
ALBA
(gasps)
What is going on in here!?
JEROME AND MAGNUS
Alba!
ALBA
What’s burning?
HOLLY
The appointment book! Why it is on fire?!
ALBA
Does it matter why? Put it out!
MAGNUS
It’s okay, boss! Everything is under control!
Holly puts out the fire.
HOLLY
Agh! There we go.
ALBA
Get out of my way, Jerome.
MAGNUS
No no, he’s holding the door closed!
ALBA
Why? What’s going on in the back?
HOLLY
And why is the door bulging like that?
A dangerous creaking. A hinge flies off with a bang.
JEROME
The hinges are giving out! Save yourselves!
He leaps up and runs for safety outside. The door to the operating room bursts open, sending cubic tons of water flooding outwards.
EXT. GARDEN—CONTINUOUS
Alba, Magnus, Holly and Jerome all scream as they are carried out into the garden. All of them cough and sputter.
MAGNUS
Did we get ’em?
Ahoy! Bandits! Show yourselves!
He runs back in the front door, footsteps sloshing.
HOLLY
Oh, my wings! Alba? Alba, where are you?
JEROME
She’s up in the tree. Alba! Are you okay?
HOLLY
Just hang on! I’ll come and get you!
ALBA
(shouts down)
I’ll be right down. After I finish counting to a hundred.
Magnus emerges from the building again.
MAGNUS
Where the heck did they go? Jerome, did you see any of them?
JEROME
Uh… no, there’s nobody here.
HOLLY
See who? Magnus, were there patients inside?!
MAGNUS
No, they weren’t patients. They were brigands!
JEROME
I guess they got out?
MAGNUS
But how? The window in the lab is tiny!
ALBA
Oh, Magnus… can I have a word with you?
MAGNUS
Oh man. Alba. You wouldn’t believe what happened, but lucky for you, Magnus was here to save the day—
ALBA
Potes volare!
Sound of magic lifting Magnus into the air.
MAGNUS
Whoa! Hey! Put me down!
Listen, it was Guy van Fleet!
ALBA
Guy van Fleet, the highwayman.
MAGNUS
No, Guy van Fleet the undertaker! Yes, of course it was—
ALBA
Guy van Fleet came here.
MAGNUS
Yes! He attacked the House of Healing! It’s true!
ALBA
Magnus, I am done with your lies, your disobedience, your attitude, your disregard for safety and constantly having to—
HOLLY
Alba… there is a sword here. No… two swords.
MAGNUS
See, I told you! Guy was here with fifty men! Jerome, back me up here.
JEROME
Well, I don’t think it was fifty…
MAGNUS
Exactly, it was more like a hundred! It was a siege.
ALBA
Enough.
A whistle of magic as Magnus is carried away, his yelling diminishing into the distance.
MAGNUS
Listen, I’m the victim here! Albaaa!
HOLLY
Alba, what if Magnus is telling the truth?
ALBA
Well, then, he can have a nice, refreshing dip in the leech pond.
In the distance, Magnus yelps as he tumbles into the water.
> MUSIC STING
INT. LABORATORY
Water drips in the background.
ALBA
Look at this mess. We were gone for less than an hour!
JEROME
Oh boy. I’m sorry, Alba. Can I help sweep up?
ALBA
I expect something like this from Magnus. But you, Jerome?
JEROME
I just stopped by to get a refill of that potion you gave me for my insomnia—
ALBA
Save it. I’m done. Finis. Factum. No more nice witch. Clear the lab bench, Holly.
HOLLY
Okay. Do you want me to put all these bottles in the back room, or—
ALBA
Never mind.
She sweeps all the items off the table.
HOLLY
Alba! Are you okay?
Alba begins gathering ingredients.
ALBA
Oh yes. I’m beyond okay, Holly. I’m done being trifled with, dismissed and ignored. Lock your doors and hide your children! The witch is back.
HOLLY
Alba?
ALBA
Holly, go fetch Magnus out of the pond. We’re off to visit Minister Pearcey.
> MUSIC STING
INT. MINISTRY OFFICE
A clock ticks.
PEARCEY
Shall we begin?
ALBA
Yes, let’s. I brought a little something along to aid our investigation.
She places a bottle on the table.
PEARCEY
And this is?
ALBA
A truth potion.
MAGNUS
Why do you not trust me?
I mean, sure, maybe I… stretched the truth on previous occasions. But this is serious! This all really happened!
ALBA
Well then, you won’t mind giving your evidence under the influence of a truth serum.
MAGNUS
If that’s what it is.
ALBA
Minister?
PEARCEY
I’ll permit it.
ALBA
Go ahead, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Yeah? How do I know it’s not, like, fireweed extract?
PEARCEY
Magnus, please do as you’re asked.
MAGNUS
This stuff could be hemlock, for all you know.
JEROME
Alba wouldn’t do that!
MAGNUS
Pfft. Well, you drink it, then!
JEROME
Okay!
ALBA
Jerome, no, don’t—!
Too late. He uncorks the bottle and downs it.
JEROME
Mmm! That’s nice.
ALBA
Jerome, I swear to all the gods…
JEROME
It tastes like that Frinozipax stuff you were prescribing last year.
PEARCEY
What’s Frinozipax?
JEROME
Why, it’s an all-natural herbal potion made from—
ALBA
(sharply)
Let’s begin our questioning.
JEROME
(feeling the effects and totally enamoured with Alba)
Yes! I’m ready to be interrogated, Alba.
PEARCEY
It’s not an interrogation. It’s an interview.
MAGNUS
Pfff. Yeah, you leave the room and see how fast this turns into an interrogation.
PEARCEY
Come to think of it, I could use a coffee. Alba?
ALBA
Yes please. Interviewing does work up quite a thirst.
Pearcey heads for the door.
PEARCEY
Two sugars?
MAGNUS
No! You can’t leave me alone with her. Look, we’re talking! We have nothing to hide!
She sits back down.
PEARCEY
Good. Then why don’t we begin at the beginning. You say several bandits broke into the House of Healing?
MAGNUS
Yes, I say that, because they did.
ALBA
Why did they have to break in? We were supposed to be open for business.
MAGNUS
Well… okay, maybe they didn’t break in. But they took me by surprise!
ALBA
Were you perhaps asleep at reception?
MAGNUS
I object! That’s not germane to this investigation!
ALBA
(clears her throat)
MAGNUS
Okay! Okay! Yes, I was at the desk. And I may have closed my eyes, just for a second. The next thing I knew, I was surrounded by all these bandits…
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
Footsteps. Several swords are drawn.
GUY
Don’t make me tell you again.
BANDIT 3
Yeah, don’t make the boss tell you again. Drop the letter opener.
Magnus drops it.
MAGNUS
Heh. Okay. Look, let’s just talk this over like good, decent fellow outlaws. You know I’m totally your guy, Guy!
GUY
Bind him and secure the rest of the building.
Guy heads down the back hallway as the bandits tie Magnus up..
BANDIT 4
Hold still, kid.
MAGNUS
Owwww! Really?
BANDIT 4
Settle down or it’s gonna hurt a lot more.
MAGNUS
(shouts after Guy)
A surgeon is always a good thing to have around, right Guy?
What if you get hurt in a daring duel with the King’s guard? Or you have to make a spectacular leap from a tower and break a leg?
GUY
Indeed. Now, tell me… things seem to have been rearranged since I was last here. Where do you keep the most dangerous poisons?
MAGNUS
Poisons? Well, I don’t know if you noticed the sign, but this is a House of Healing, and we don’t—grrk!
He gasps as Guy draws his sword and presses the blade to his throat.
GUY
Such lovely and smooth skin you surgeons have. It cries out to be split open. I am not going to ask you again.
MAGNUS
Okay! Okay! Look, everything’s in the new secure storage. The big metal door off the back hallway.
GUY
That wasn’t so hard, was it?
MAGNUS
Yeah, but I don’t know the password. And without that, it’s pretty much impenetrable.
GUY
Ha!
MAGNUS
Hey, I should know. I’ve tried everything.
GUY
They have yet to make a safe that can keep out Guy van Fleet, the purple thief of Kings, the hinderer of royalty, the people’s most feared champion.
MAGNUS
You can crack safes too?
GUY
Watch and learn, young Magnus.
MAGNUS
So awesome.
INT. MINISTRY OFFICE
PEARCEY
Awesome?
MAGNUS
Yeah. I was buttering him up. Distracting him. He was so busy going on about how great he was that he forgot all about the letter opener. All part of my ingenious plan…
ALBA
Enough. Jerome?
JEROME
(enraptured)
Yes, Alba?
ALBA
How did you get wrapped up in all this?
MAGNUS
You mean, how did he help me save the day!
ALBA
Speak again, Magnus. Go ahead. Just one more word.
Jerome?
JEROME
Your eyes are so beautiful when you’re angry.
ALBA
(groans)
Yes, thank you, Jerome. Why were you at at the House of Healing?
JEROME
To refill my prescription.
ALBA
The one I gave you yesterday?
JEROME
Well… Yeah. I kinda drank it all in one go so I’d have an excuse to see you again. Because, you know, you’re just so smart and amazing and perfect and… did I say amazing?
ALBA
We definitely gave the potion to the wrong idiot.
PEARCEY
Jerome. Jerome.
(taps sharply on the desk)
Over here. Yes. Can you tell us what you saw when you came into the House of Healing?
JEROME
Oh yeah. Magnus was there. But Alba wasn’t! I didn’t see her anywhere. She’s great, isn’t she?
PEARCEY
Focus, Jerome. What did you see?
JEROME
Well, let’s see. I walked in and there he was, tied to his chair…
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
The front door opens.
JEROME
Hello! Alba?
MAGNUS
Shhh!
JEROME
Huh? Who’s there?
MAGNUS
Jerome, be quiet! Get over here and help me.
JEROME
Magnus? Why are you tied up?
MAGNUS
Because I wanted to try out a new magic trick.
JEROME
Oh. Are you practicing escapes now? How’s it work?
MAGNUS
It doesn’t. Never mind! We’re being robbed!
JEROME
Oh no! We are?
MAGNUS
Come on, get me out of these ropes. There’s a letter opener on the desk.
JEROME
Okay. Who’s robbing us?
Jerome sets to work sawing at the ropes.
MAGNUS
Guy van Fleet! And his bandits!
JEROME
(gasps)
They don’t have Alba, do they? We have to save her!
He stands up.
MAGNUS
No, no, stop! She’s not here. There’s like five brigands in there. Now hurry up and cut me loose!
JEROME
Gotcha.
He saws at the ropes, which give way.
MAGNUS
That’s better. All right, let’s go!
JEROME
Okay!
Jerome makes for the door.
MAGNUS
No, no—Jerome, where are you going?
JEROME
To the gatehouse to alert the palace guards?
MAGNUS
No, if we go and get the guards, Guy and his guys are gonna get away!
Come on, no one is going to rob the House of Healing on my watch! That’s MY job!
JEROME
So what do we do?
MAGNUS
I’ve been thinking this through. First priority, we need to jam the back door shut—and that job falls to you, my faithful sidekick.
JEROME
Who, me?
MAGNUS
Now, they’re probably gonna have someone watching the back door, so… toss me that umbrella by the coatrack.
JEROME
Okay…?
Jerome tosses the umbrella.
MAGNUS
In the meantime, I will provide a distraction. Go!
He throws open the door to the back hallway and brandishes the umbrella.
MAGNUS
Ha ha!
BANDIT 1
Whoa! The kid got loose.
The bandits draw their weapons.
GUY
Oho! Perhaps I underestimated you, little man.
MAGNUS
Oho! Perhaps you did!
A bandit runs in from the back.
BANDIT 2
What’s happening?
GUY
Nothing to worry about. You should be watching the back door!
BANDIT 2
Right. Sorry, boss.
MAGNUS
Hah!
Take this! and that!
GUY
With an umbrella?
MAGNUS
Spinning death blow!
The umbrella opens with a pop.
BANDIT 3
Get him!
The bandits draw their swords.
GUY
Impressive. No, my friends, stand back.
BANDIT 1
You don’t want us to thump him, boss?
GUY
No. I have him. I am going to enjoy this. Toss me your sword.
MAGNUS
Oh. You need two swords, do you?
GUY
It is not for me. I prefer not to strike down unarmed children. Catch!
He tosses the sword to Magnus.
MAGNUS
Your last mistake! Vortex Blade!
A whirlwind of blades. Guy defends with little effort.
GUY
I see you have not improved at all since our last encounter.
MAGNUS
Tiger Claw! HA!
GUY
There is no need for you to call your strikes, boy. Especially when your strikes are as pitiful as that!
BANDIT 2
Yeah!
MAGNUS
Hey! That was an awesome Tiger Claw!
GUY
Aha!
His blade zings out.
MAGNUS
(gasps)
Ah! A lucky strike! But you only just nicked me.
GUY
Death by a thousand cuts. A horrible way to go.
MAGNUS
Not today!
BANDIT 2
Boss, I think someone jammed the back door.
GUY
What? You imbecile!
Jerome looks in from reception.
JEROME
Magnus! I jammed the back door. Now what?
MAGNUS
Fall back to the waiting room!
GUY
Oh no you don’t!
MAGNUS
Hell yeah we do!
Magnus slams the door. The bandits beat on it from the other side.
MAGNUS
Enjoy your stay!
(winces in pain)
JEROME
That looks bad, Magnus!
MAGNUS
It feels worse! Oh gods.
BANDIT 1
Hey! Open this door!
They pound at the door.
MAGNUS
Quick! Grab that chair and push it under the door handle.
JEROME
That door’s not gonna hold them, Magnus! We gotta get out of here!
MAGNUS
No, no, sit, Jerome. Sit in the chair. Good boy.
Now, where does Alba keep the matches?
JEROME
Uh… are you sure about this?
Magnus rummages, tossing things out from drawers, as the pounding on the door grows.
MAGNUS
Aha! Now to start a fun little fire…
He strikes a match.
JEROME
Hey! Isn’t that the appointment book? Alba’s not gonna be happy.
A growing crackle of flame.
MAGNUS
Man, my arm hurts! Dammit, all the bandages are in the other room, too.
JEROME
So… now do we run?
MAGNUS
Nope. This is the good bit—see there’s a new fire suppression system in here.
JEROME
A what?
MAGNUS
There’s half a dozen water sprites living in the attic. If they smell smoke from down here…
The sprites burst out singing a shrill alarm as waterfall sounds emerge from the back room.
MAGNUS
They do that.
Supposed to keep the patients and all of our flammable supplies safe or something.
A raging fire now. The sound of several bandits yelling and pounding on the other side of an interior door.
BANDITS
Boss! What do we do? Help!
MAGNUS
It’s working. Ha ha, listen to them!
JEROME
I dunno, Magnus…
MAGNUS
No, no! Jerome, do not get up! We have to keep the door shut!
The pounding grows weaker and stops as the water on the far side of the door rises.
JEROME
We’re not… killing them, are we?
MAGNUS
It’s just a little water. They’re bandits! Brigands! They can swim!
BANDIT 1
(from inside)
Help! I can’t swim!
MAGNUS
Or I guess that’s pirates. Pirates can probably swim.
INT. MINISTRY OFFICE
PEARCEY
So tell us, if there was a band of highwaymen trapped in the back room… where did they go?
JEROME
I dunno! They were there, and then they were gone.
ALBA
Magnus?
MAGNUS
Well… I mean, yeah! Exactly!
We locked the doors. All the windows were still shut. And the water was all the way to the ceiling!
PEARCEY
Hmm. Perhaps we should take another look at the scene of the incident.
ALBA
I suppose we should.
PEARCEY
Jerome, you are free to go.
JEROME
Thanks!
MAGNUS
And me? Am I free to go?
Alba, Pearcey and Jerome file out of the room.
JEROME
Can I come along with you, Alba?
ALBA
No. Go home.
JEROME
Awww.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—CABINET
A tiny, enclosed metal space.
BANDIT 3
Ow! Move your elbow!
BANDIT 2
Move your face!
The bandits struggle and grumble at one another.
GUY
All of you shush!
They all fall silent.
GUY
Okay. I think the coast is clear. On the count of three, everyone push. One. Two. Three.
Groans and shouts as they force the filing cabinet drawer open.
GUY
Okay. One a time. Stop pushing!
The bandits struggle to pull themselves from the filing cabinet.
BANDIT 1
That was a brilliant plan, boss! Hiding with all the files!
BANDIT 2
Yeah! Heh heh. I think I got a paper cut.
GUY
I am not so happy right now.
BANDITS
Sorry, boss.
GUY
This is not over. The little surgeon will pay dearly for this.

Oh! Parabel, you’re still up.
PARABEL
Mm hmm.
GUNTHER
What are you reading, dear?
PARABEL
Oh… just a few books on pre-natal care.
GUNTHER
Superfoods For Your Unborn Baby. My… Raising the Magical Child.
(chuckles)
Are we having “the magical child”?
PARABEL
Oh, they’re all magical, aren’t they?
I just want to give the baby a good head start in life.
GUNTHER
I don’t think we can afford to bring in musicians to play for you around the clock again.
PARABEL
Oh no, nothing like that this time.
(mutters)
Not after little Willemina decided to smash her violin. On her violin teacher.
GUNTHER
101 Spells For Mothers-To-Be. Isn’t it a bit risky to do magic while you’re expecting?
PARABEL
Oh, no, these are all minor charms. Completely harmless.
GUNTHER
Ah, I see.
PARABEL
(mutters)
And completely useless.
GUNTHER
Well, good night, dearest. Don’t stay up too late.
PARABEL
I won’t! Night, darling.
They make kissy-kissy sounds at one another.
As Gunther shuffles to the bedroom, Parabel tosses her book aside.
PARABEL
(sighs)
Useless.
To the Library it is.
OPENING THEME
HERALD
By Appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician—Volume Two! Episode the Fourth: Harvest Moon.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFICE—DAY
PEARCEY
For the last time, Magnus, you may not play with knives at the reception desk.
MAGNUS
I wasn’t playing with it! I was showing it to our patients. They were totally interested!
ALBA
They were being polite to the person with the knife.
PEARCEY
I think the safety risk is quite evident.
MAGNUS
What about my safety? We got held up by bandits last week!
PEARCEY
What if you turn your back and a child takes it?
MAGNUS
(scoffs)
I know three easy ways to disarm an opponent with a knife.
(beat)
Two of them are non-lethal?
ALBA
No knives, Magnus.
Holly skips in, and begins handing out flowers.
HOLLY
Happy Harvest Moon, everyone!
PEARCEY
What are these?
HOLLY
Flower garlands! To wear to the Harvest Moon Faire tonight! You’re all going, right?
Silence.
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Aw, come on! There’s going to be drinking and dancing and music and pretty lanterns.
MAGNUS
So… can I have my knife back?
ALBA AND PEARCEY
No.
HOLLY
And costumes and cotton candy, and jugglers and plays…
PEARCEY
I’ll have to check my calendar.
ALBA
I’ve got another round of resumes to look through for the new hospital we’re setting up in Paradox.
HOLLY
Aww. You should give yourselves at least one night off! Balancing life and work is important. Right, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCEY
A night off is fine, of course. Whether or not you spend it at the Faire is up to you.
HOLLY
Alba’s going to go. Right, Alba?
ALBA
I thought you’d have some special fairy ritual to enact for the full moon.
HOLLY
That’s not happening this year. I’ve been kind of uninvited. But that means I can spend more time with all of you! What do you say?
ALBA
Oh… fine.
MAGNUS
Yeah, I guess.
HOLLY
Ms Pearcey? C’mon, it’s a perfect chance for us to bond as a team!
PEARCEY
Yes… bonding as a… team.
HOLLY
Yay! This is going to be the best Harvest Moon ever!
MUSIC STING
INT. PALACE LIBRARY
The sound of a heavy page turning.
JULIA
Ooo, jackpot.
AMANDA
So, Julia. When you have a moment…
JULIA
(still writing)
Uh huh?
AMANDA
Perhaps all these lovely, priceless tomes could find a better place to live than the checkout desk?
JULIA
In a minute. Hey Amanda. I found a chapter in Sarvik’s Historias about Balgomarian Yeti. Check this out.
Julia turns a page.
AMANDA
They’re green?
JULIA
And only three feet high.
AMANDA
Aww!
JULIA
It sounds like they’re a matriarchal society.
AMANDA
Small green ladies in charge. I’m a fan.
JULIA
The best part: The Yetani, as they call themselves, are famous for their gin, made from a rare juniper bush which only grows in the ice caves of the Frozen Sea.
AMANDA
I already want some.
JULIA
And they mix it with ice wine, birch syrup and vodka to make something called a Green Flame.
AMANDA
Wait, Green Flame—does that mean you light it on fire?
JULIA
You totally light it on fire.
AMANDA
Yes! Do you think the palace kitchens have Yetani gin?
JULIA
Not any more!
I may have already stopped by the kitchens on my way into work.
Julia pulls out a big bottle and sets it on the desk, followed by a pair of cocktail glasses.
AMANDA
Yes! I want mine with extra flame!
Julia sets to work as Parabel enters.
PARABEL
You there. Librarians.
AMANDA
Oh! Your Majesty. Hi!
JULIA
Royal Librarians at your service.
She shakes a cocktail shaker.
PARABEL
Are you drinking? On the job?!
AMANDA
Uh. Nope! Not yet.
JULIA
We are compiling the first comprehensive ethnographic study of the drinking cultures of Farloria and the neighbouring—
PARABEL
I don’t know why I asked.
I sent a page down yesterday to retrieve a book.
Amanda starts digging through papers.
AMANDA
Yes, sorry, your Majesty. So you were after… The Six Books De Rerum Spiritus of Sundvik, Tome 2?
PARABEL
That is the one.
JULIA
I think that one’s in our Rare Documents collection.
She begins hunting through drawers of index cards.
AMANDA
So. Can I get your Majesty a drink? Of water, I mean? Or coffee?
PARABEL
I am fine.
AMANDA
Cool. Cool cool.
JULIA
Okay, I show three copies. One’s at our sister branch in Fair-Upon-Middling. The second one… Does your Majesty read Vayaxan?
PARABEL
Excuse me?
JULIA
It’s the original edition, written in demonic script.
PARABEL
Hmph. And the third copy?
JULIA
Yeah, the third one’s a more recent translation. But it’s out on loan since… oh, wow.
AMANDA
Who loaned out a book from Rare Documents?
JULIA
It says it was checked out by Mr. Krankel.
PARABEL
Doctor Krankel.
JULIA
That’s the one.
PARABEL
He’s been banished from the kingdom.
AMANDA
Someone’s going to be owing a lot of late fees!
PARABEL
(clears her throat)
I require a copy of this book.
JULIA
Uh… Demonic script?
PARABEL
That I can read.
Jula returns to the counter.
JULIA
I’ll put in a request, but it’s going to be about a week and a half.
AMANDA
What about secondary sources, Julia?
PARABEL
Secondary sources?
Amanda and Julia begin leafing through other big books.
JULIA
Yeah, there may be some useful references to it in other books. Try Benneghi’s Compendium?
AMANDA
Yup, on it.
JULIA
I didn’t realize you were so interested in ancient magic, Your Majesty!
PARABEL
Just… curious.
AMANDA
Okay, I think I found a reference. It’s by Fractazius?
JULIA
Oh, right! Good old Fractazius the Dark.
Julia vanishes into the stacks to search.
AMANDA
See, Fractazius apparently wrote a play based on The Books De Rerum Spiritus.
PARABEL
A play? What use is that?
JULIA
The Ambassador of Doom. It’s said to actually contain key passages from the Books.
PARABEL
I see…
AMANDA
Ooo, it looks like it was even banned once, back in King Lothar’s time.
Julia returns, flipping through a small book.
JULIA
I’m guessing that was after the disaster at the Grandville Opry.
AMANDA
Oh, when it burned down?
JULIA
Well, supposedly the fire was just a cover-up for what really happened.
AMANDA
Uh-oh!
JULIA
On opening night, the lead actress suddenly transformed into a demonic beast of unparalleled power that killed dozens before being subdued by the town guard!
AMANDA
Whoa.
PARABEL
Unparalleled power, you say?
JULIA
She leapt into the front row and devoured the patrons’ faces.
AMANDA
Nooo!
PARABEL
I will have this play.
AMANDA
See, this is why no one likes audience participation.
JULIA
I know, right? Hmm. There’s no publishing date, but I think this might be the first printing?
PARABEL
Yes. I will have it now, please.
JULIA
Oh. Sure. Was there anything else, your Majesty…?
Parabel is already striding out in a huff.
PARABEL
Unbelievable.
AMANDA
Cranky.
JULIA
I wonder why she wanted that book, anyway?
AMANDA
Eh, royalty. Who knows why they do anything?
JULIA
So, drinks?
AMANDA
Hell yes!
Julia pours out the drinks and strikes a match. There’s a little whoomph of flame.
JULIA
Ohh, even the flames are green.
AMANDA
Nice!
They clink glasses.
AMANDA AND JULIA
Cheers!

INT. PEARCEY’S BEDROOM
LORIA
Someone’s all gwumpy pants.
PEARCEY
I am not grumpy.
LORIA
No, you’re gwumpy pants. That’s worse.
PEARCEY
We could just stay in… Have a nice dinner and a relaxing bath?
LORIA
We can do that any old night. It’s our anniversary!
PEARCEY
Which anniversary?
LORIA
Of the night we first met!
PEARCEY
We met at an office party the night of the Harvest Moon Faire.
LORIA
Exactly!
PEARCEY
The Harvest Moon is on a different date every year.
LORIA
It’s not the date. It’s the occasion, silly. Let’s go dance and watch fireworks and eat fried pumpkin on a stick. C’mon, gwumpy pants.
PEARCEY
I am not gwumpy pants.
LORIA
Can you say that again with a little bit more of a pout?
PEARCEY
I just… What if one of those miserable wizards from the OSG sees us together?
LORIA
Tally. Who cares what they think?
PEARCEY
We’re fighting to get them to abide by proper workplace guidelines… and here I am, seeing you.
LORIA
And?
PEARCEY
I’m your superior.
LORIA
(snickers)
Debatable.
PEARCEY
Rude. You know what I mean. I don’t want to set a bad example.
LORIA
You do realize this is the one night of the year you don’t have to worry about being recognized.
PEARCEY
What do you mean?
Loria opens her purse.
LORIA
There’s this little thing called a masquerade.
PEARCEY
That’s true. But where are we going to get…
She comes to a halt as Loria holds up a pair of masks.
LORIA
(proudly)
Ah?
PEARCEY
…masks. Why do you have all these masquerade masks?
LORIA
“Thank you, Loria! They’re so beautiful! You’re a genius.”
PEARCEY
They are… quite pretty.
LORIA
Yeah, they are. Here, I picked this one for you.
Pearcey tries it on.
PEARCEY
I’ve never worn one of these before.
LORIA
Oh, that looks super adorable! Yes, a thousand times yes.
PEARCEY
All right. What about you?
LORIA
Well… I like this lacey blue one but there’s also this silvery one with the little ears… What do you think?
PEARCEY
(entranced)
That one.
LORIA
The blue?
PEARCEY
I think you should definitely wear that one.
LORIA
Done.
(beat)
What?
PEARCEY
(coy)
Do we really have to go out tonight?
LORIA
Come on, you, let’s get dressed.
MUSIC STING
EXT. FAIRGROUND STALL, EARLY EVENING
A bustling crowd in high spirits. Drummers perform nearby.
WITHROW
Duviar nectar! Fresh-squeezed duviar nectar!
FAIRE-GOER
(quite drunk)
Say, I’ll have one of those!
Withrow pours a cupful of juice from a keg.
WITHROW
You betcha. That’ll be sixpence.
FAIRE-GOER
Okay. Whoa, that’s a lot.
WITHROW
Fresh duviar fruit’s hard to come by in these parts, but it’s the most healthful drink you’ll drink all night, my friend.
FAIRE-GOER
(chuckles)
Well, you’re not wrong about that.
Coins jingle.
WITHROW
Have a great Faire!
(to the next customer)
Good evening, friend. Can I get you a nice cup of duviar nectar?
MAGNUS
(disguising his voice)
What’s in it?
Withrow starts pouring another cup.
WITHROW
Only one hundred percent fresh-squeezed duviar fruit, direct from the Pointy Lands. An excellent source of duviatic acid, which has been shown to aid in pancreatic function. And a happy pancreas makes for a happy stomach. That’ll be sixpence, my friend.
Magnus pulls back his hood.
MAGNUS
(back to his normal voice)
Oh no. You’re busted, sucker!
WITHROW
Busted—what? Why?
MAGNUS
House of Healing Hygiene Enforcement Squad! Withrow Lee, you are charged with selling drinks without a license.
WITHROW
Uh, it’s right here. Say, aren’t you that kid that works for Alba? Mathias…
MAGNUS
Magnus. And I’m eighteen, by the way, and certified by the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health, by the way.
WITHROW
Certified to do what?
MAGNUS
Certified to take you downtown, buddy.
All right, fine, your so-called license looks legit. But what about this health drink of yours?
WITHROW
Duviatic acid’s a real thing. Ask Alba! There’s even evidence it may boost the immune system, but I don’t tell my customers that because there’s only been the one study so far.
MAGNUS
Well, aren’t you a paragon of scientific rigour.
WITHROW
Darn tootin’. If I lie, Alba will wire my mouth shut.
MAGNUS
Hmph. Do you reuse these cups?
WITHROW
Sterilized after every use with a Purissimus spell.
MAGNUS
Dangit.
Fine. But how do we know this fruit isn’t contaminated with deadly… fig fungus?
WITHROW
(dubious)
Fig fungus?
MAGNUS
It’s spreading all over the Pointy Lands. One little spore can paralyze you from head to toe.
WITHROW
Look, can I get on with selling my wares now?
MAGNUS
Go ahead. But I’ll be watching you, buddy.
WITHROW
Knock yourself out.
(raises his voice again)
Duviar nectar! Sixpence a glass!
MUSIC STING
EXT. MARKET SQUARE STAGE
A boisterous crowd watches a player on a stage.
PLAYER
And these two souls once so in love
Do murder one another for the sake
Of money, greed and power, you shall see
Next Friday ‘pon this stage, at half past eight!
A smattering of applause. Holly flutters through the crowd.
HOLLY
Alba!
ALBA
Down here.
FAIRE-GOER
Hey, watch the wings!
HOLLY
Sorry!
(to Alba)
Did I miss the previews?
ALBA
Yes, he just finished. Why do they always have to give away the entire story?
PLAYER
And now, my friends, be much afeared! Our main event at last is here:
The Tragic History of Baron Bolgu… brought to you by the Guild of Knife Sharpeners.
Applause. Two more actors take the stage: the gruff Cook and the young Master Martin.
COOK
Ho there, good Master Martin!
MARTIN
Ho there, cook! Have you the evening repast prepared?
COOK
‘Tis under way, ’tis under way.
MARTIN
You must work fast! The repast is well past time.
COOK
I blame these blasted blades.
MARTIN
Ay, these are in a truly ‘trocious state, good cook. No good to chop a chop, these.
COOK
Such a dull tool could scarce split the wind from an old nun’s backside. Speaking of dull tools, how fares our lord the Count?
Laughter. The play continues under Alba and Holly’s dialogue.
ALBA
Looks like there’s going to be a murder.
HOLLY
Oh no! How can you tell?
ALBA
They’re doing an ad for the Knife-Sharpeners’ Guild. They always sponsor the true crime ones.
HOLLY
Oh, you’re right! I’d never noticed that.
ALBA
At least it’s better than the love stories, where they’re all ads for mattresses.
HOLLY
I don’t know if I want to see a murdery play.
MARTIN
The Count is in a rare mood.
COOK
How rare? Bloody?
MARTIN
A bloody rare mood indeed! He rants on his hunger and he rails on his thirst.
JEROME
Oh! Hey! Alba, is that you?
ALBA
Dammit.
HOLLY
Hello, Jerome!
JEROME
Holly! Nice to see you too. Mind if I sit here?
ALBA
(under her breath)
Well, so much for enjoying the show.
COOK
The Count did dine but an hour ago. Let him rant and rail and perhaps he shall shout himself hoarse.
MARTIN
Or myself deaf.
COOK
And bring you peace, either way.
MARTIN
I sooner would keep my ears. The Count must have food!
COOK
Then quick, hie you to the sharpener’s shop, and he’ll shortly shave and shape these shivs sharp as shark’s teeth.
MARTIN
I surely shall!
COOK
Mind you, good Master Martin, forget not your purse, lest you return transfixed with our best blade ‘twixt your ribs, for ’tis never sharp to short the sharpener.
Laughter and applause. In the background, another actor takes the stage: the Baron, giving his opening soliloquy.
JEROME
Did I miss anything?
HOLLY
Alba says there’s going to be a murder.
JEROME
Really? How can you tell?
ALBA
Oh, I just have this feeling.
JEROME
That reminds me. I’ve been having a feeling too, kind of an itching. I tried that salve you ladies gave me the other week, but it’s been getting worse all day.
ALBA
How about we watch the first act?
JEROME
Okay, I can wait!
HOLLY
(whispers)
Alba…!
ALBA
(whispers)
What?
HOLLY
It’s going to be dark soon. Don’t you think we should, you know, get Jerome to somewhere safer?
ALBA
We just got here.
HOLLY
The moon’s going to rise, and then… you know.
ALBA
I know.
HOLLY
Maybe we should tell him that he’s a—
ALBA
He does not need another excuse to pester me for more cures. Besides, he’s perfectly nice when he’s… affected.
HOLLY
You mean when he’s a werewolf.
ALBA
Not so loud! Just the first act, that’s all I ask. We can go at intermission.
HOLLY
But—
ALBA
Intermission. Now hush.
BARON
Ho, who’s there? My ears yet ring.
Methought I heard a voice from in the hearth.
DEMON
(hisses)
Hail and well met!
BARON
What! Who art thou, fiend?
JEROME
Oh, look! Isn’t that the guy who played Count Bozannio last spring?
HOLLY
I missed that show. Ooo, I love his outfit!
ALBA
Can you both be quiet for one single minute?
MUSIC STING
EXT. FAIRGROUNDS—DUSK
Loria and Pearcey approach a lively crowd of revelers dancing to a band of musicians.
LORIA
What about the Gryphon and Bucket?
PEARCEY
That wasn’t our first date. You tricked me.
LORIA
It still counts.
PEARCEY
You said it was a departmental planning session.
LORIA
It worked. I seem to remember it worked about five more times after that?
PEARCEY
(laughs)
Maybe.
But no. Our first official, mutually-agreed-upon date was May 12.
LORIA
Remind me?
PEARCEY
7pm. Closer to 7:15.
LORIA
I believe you. What happened?
PEARCEY
Dinner. Dancing. Ice cream.
LORIA
(mischievous)
Ohh, the ice cream, yes…
Wow. So that’s your idea of a first date?
PEARCEY
Well…!
LORIA
Damn, you’re pretty forward, aren’t you?
PEARCEY
Minx.
LORIA
Hussy.
They laugh. Holly flutters past overhead.
HOLLY
Oh, hi! Loria, is that you?
LORIA
Yes?
PEARCEY
(under her breath)
Oh, no.
HOLLY
Hi! It’s me! Holly? From the House of Healing?
LORIA
Of course! How are you?
HOLLY
I’m good! Gosh, what a pretty mask! I almost didn’t recognize you. Who’s your friend?
PEARCEY
(disguising her voice)
Uh… I’m Tally.
HOLLY
Hi Tally! You both look super cute.
PEARCEY
Thanks.
LORIA
So. You having a good Faire?
HOLLY
It’s so neat! All the candy and ribbons… Oh, but I almost forgot. Have you seen a dog running around?
LORIA
What kind of dog?
HOLLY
About this big, kind of unusual-looking? He’s got a short muzzle, strangely wide at the shoulders… His name’s Toby.
LORIA
I haven’t seen anything bigger than a beagle.
PEARCEY
Yeah, me neither.
LORIA
Sorry, Holly. We’ll keep an eye out!
HOLLY
Thanks! Nice seeing you!
She takes off again.
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Toby! C’mere buddy! Toby!
PEARCEY
That was a close one. Do you think she suspected?
LORIA
Oh, for heaven’s sake.
PEARCEY
I’m serious.
LORIA
Are you going to let that ruin your night? You are, aren’t you.
PEARCEY
I knew this was a bad idea.
LORIA
Look. If it’s going to be like this every time we go out together… I think you’d better let me go.
PEARCEY
Let you…?
LORIA
You’ve basically replaced me with that talking rock.
PEARCEY
Leon isn’t a replacement. A rock can’t do filing or run errands.
LORIA
Well, I’m glad I can provide such valuable assistance.
PEARCEY
That’s not what I mean.
LORIA
This secret office romance bit has been exciting and everything, but I think we’d better call it off.
PEARCEY
(devastated)
Loria…
A moment.
LORIA
(realizes)
The office part, you goof, not the romance.
PEARCEY
Oh, thank the gods.
LORIA
I bet I can get a transfer to the Planning Office. I’d be two floors up. Keep an eye on His Majesty’s latest crazy ideas.
Tally, I’m not leaving you.
PEARCEY
Just your job?
LORIA
Just my job. Why do you think I took it in the first place?
PEARCEY
What, to be near me?
(laughs)
LORIA
What can I say? I’m very goal-driven in my career.
Come here.
They kiss.
PEARCEY
So if we’re not working together, what are we going to do for excitement?
LORIA
Mmm. We’ll have to think of something.
PEARCEY
Well… come dance with me. Let’s see if it sparks any ideas.
EXT. FAIRGROUND STALL
It’s quieter here, though the crowd is still lively. Crickets can be heard further off.
Withrow counts out some coins for a customer.
WITHROW
And that’s seven, eight, nine is one shilling, plus five more is your change.
CUSTOMER
Thank you!
WITHROW
You have yourself a great evening, my friend.
MAGNUS
You keep giving them the right change.
WITHROW
I keep telling you, there is no scam.
MAGNUS
Yeah, right.
WITHROW
Duviar nectar! Fresh from the Pointy Lands!
MAGNUS
The way Alba tells it, you’re always up to something.
WITHROW
Get your fresh squeezed duviar nectar!
In the distance, there’s an unearthly howl, and screams of panic.
MAGNUS
So, like… What was your favourite?
WITHROW
Favourite what?
MAGNUS
Your favourite hustle. Your favourite scheme.
WITHROW
(whispers)
Will you stop it? I’m not hustling anyone!
MAGNUS
You can tell me. I used to be an outlaw myself. C’mon. Even just a straight-up con with no magic.
WITHROW
Hey there, Miss! Would you care for a refreshing cup of…
(no luck—he sighs)
Kid, you’re scaring away my customers.
MAGNUS
Tell me about one con and I’ll leave you alone.
WITHROW
I don’t want to talk about this.
MAGNUS
(loudly)
What’s that? Duviar fruit can carry deadly fig fungus?
Gasps from the crowd.
WITHROW
(whispers)
Kid, for Kroth’s sake.
MAGNUS
I hear one bite of a contaminated fruit will stop your heart!
Howling and barking and screams of panic, growing louder and closer.
WITHROW
All right. All right.
Okay. When Alba and I were at Hazelbrooke, we used to go to this cafe near the campus called the Crotchety Crow. And every day—
Alba rushes up.
ALBA
(winded)
Magnus! There you are.
MAGNUS
No I’m not!
ALBA
What?
MAGNUS
I was just helping Withrow! Is that so wrong?
WITHROW
Hi Alba.
ALBA
Withrow.
WITHROW
It’s so good to see you.
ALBA
Yup. Magnus, I need your help. Toby’s on the loose.
MAGNUS
Whoa, really? As in Jerome Toby?
ALBA
Yes. We have to find him. Holly’s trying to spot him from the air.
WITHROW
Who’s Toby?
ALBA
He’s a… stray dog.
WITHROW
You mean a werewolf?
ALBA
What gave you that idea?
WITHROW
Oh, full moon, howling and screaming in the distance…
MAGNUS
Oh yeah, look, there’s a full moon tonight. What are the odds?
ALBA
Why do you think they’re having a festival?
Holly zooms past.
HOLLY
(shouting from the air)
I see him! Alba, he’s coming this way! I think he’s following your scent.
ALBA
Oh, let’s hope so.
The screams get closer. Then Jerome appears, panting and woofing happily.
JEROME
Woof woof rarf woof!
ALBA
Toby! Come here, boy.
Jerome launches himself at her and knocks her to the ground.
ALBA (CONT’D)
Oof! Okay, that’s enough. No kisses.
HOLLY
Yay!
MAGNUS
Does anybody have a collar?
HOLLY
We should be fine. He’ll follow Alba just about anywhere as long as he doesn’t get distracted.
ALBA
All right, Toby. Off. Cut it out.
She pushes him off.
WITHROW
Alba? Do you want a hand?
ALBA
I’m fine.
WITHROW
Come on, let me help you up.
Jerome abruptly stops panting. Deadly silence. He lets out a deep, throaty growl.
ALBA
(quietly)
Withrow, stop. Back away, please. He can be a bit jealous—
WITHROW
He’s wagging his tail!
What’s up, buddy? Why don’t you move over and let Alba…
Jerome lunges, snarling like a demon.
WITHROW
Aagh! Whoa! Buddy! Nice werewolf!
HOLLY
Toby!
Withrow scrambles back, then runs off, screaming and pursued by a werewolf. Alba and Holly give chase, their voices all fading into the crowd.
ALBA
Withrow! I told you to back away!
WITHROW
Help!
HOLLY
Toby, it’s all right!
MAGNUS
So I’ll just look after the stall, okay? Okay!
Duviar nectar! Three pennies a glass!
EXT. FAIRGROUND MUSIC STAGE
The band finishes their song, and Pearcey and Loria emerge from the dancing crowd, laughing.
PEARCEY
I think I need a drink after that!
LORIA
Glad you came to the Faire?
PEARCEY
Yes, yes.
The dancing fairgoers suddenly erupt in panic as Jerome chases Withrow through their midst. Shouts of “Look out!” and “Mad dog!”
JEROME
(barking viciously)
WITHROW
(screaming)
Help! Somebody!
PEARCEY
Loria, look out!
LORIA
Whoa!
WITHROW
Aaaaa!
Withrow and Jerome barrel past. People scatter. The band stumbles to a halt.
PEARCEY
Are you all right?
LORIA
Yeah. Looks like they found their lost dog.
The crowd is in chaos. Holly shouts from overhead.
HOLLY
It’s okay! He won’t hurt you. Toby, over here!
WITHROW
Look out, everybody! It’s a werewolf!
Gasps from the crowd.
HOLLY
Oh, thanks, Withrow, that was really helpful!
LORIA
That was a werewolf?
PEARCEY
(sighs)
I’m going to have to write this up.
LORIA
Wow.
Cut to the midst of the crowd.
JEROME
(growls)
HOLLY
Everybody stay back! Withrow, you can move away slowly.
Withrow?
SMALL CHILD
Puppy!
BUDDY (A FAIRE-GOER)
Someone needs to deal with that dog!
HOLLY
We are dealing with him!
BIFF (ANOTHER FAIRE-GOER)
It’s not a dog, it’s a werewolf. I got this.
Biff steps out of the crowd and draws a sword. Cheers.
BUDDY
Yeah, you get him, Biff!
HOLLY
Albaaa! Where are you?!
The crowd begins to close in, some pulling out makeshift weapons. Shouts of “Fight! Fight!”
JEROME
(growls louder)
BIFF
Everybody, keep steady. We got him cornered.
I’m gonna put this dog down.
He takes a fancy swing with his sword. Loria steps in front of him.
LORIA
Uh-uh. No you don’t!
HOLLY
What she said!
BIFF
Get out of the way.
PEARCEY
Stop! Weapons down, all of you.
BIFF
Move it, ladies. I don’t want to have to hurt you.
LORIA
You back off, buddy!
PEARCEY
Are you threatening a Minister of the Crown, sir?
BIFF
(laughs)
What, you?
Pearcey takes off her mask.
PEARCEY
Yes. Antalia Pearcey, Minister of Magical Affairs and Health.
BIFF
Oooo!
HOLLY
Oh my gosh! Hi, Ms Pearcey!
PEARCEY
Yes, hello Holly.
BIFF
Well, la di da.
PEARCEY
Sir, put your sword away.
BIFF
If you’re Minister of Magical whatever, why aren’t you dealing with this animal?
PEARCEY
The situation is under control.
(whispers to Holly)
It is under control, isn’t it?
HOLLY
(whispers)
Totally! Alba’s on her way.
PEARCEY
She’d better be.
(aloud)
One of our specialists will be here at any moment.
BUDDY
That monster could hurt people!
HOLLY
He is people! He’s a person, like you and me. Even if he does steal the occasional sandwich and pee on things he shouldn’t. He’s never hurt anyone!
BIFF
Clear off, fairy.
He shoves her aside.
HOLLY
Ow! Hey!
BIFF
C’mon, little wolfy.
PEARCEY
Sir, I won’t ask you again. Put the sword away.
BIFF
This thing could kill everybody. It’s a monster.
HOLLY
He’s not a monster.
Holly’s wings start to buzz angrily. Wind howls. The crowd starts to back away.
BIFF
Says you.
(then)
What the hell are you?
HOLLY
I’m the Queen of the Wind, buster!
BIFF
(shaken)
Well, why don’t you blow awaaaay—aaaaaa!
Biff’s voice is distorted as he’s sucked into a whirlwind. His sword goes flying as the wind carries him off.
HOLLY
(straining)
There. Anybody else?
BUDDY
Nope, I think I’m good.
The crowd mutters uncertainly. The wind dies down and Holly’s wings buzz to a stop.
Alba runs up.
ALBA
Get out of the way.
Toby!
PEARCEY
Ms Salix. Thank heavens.
JEROME
(pants happily)
ALBA
Good boy. Come here. Is everything all right?
Holly?
HOLLY
(giddy from exhaustion)
Hi Alba! I, um… there was a guy with a sword and I… kind of stopped him.
She falls over.
ALBA
Holly?
JEROME
Woof!
PEARCEY
As you were. Thank you, everyone. Please, go back to enjoying the Faire.
LORIA
The Minister commands you to go have fun.
The crowd reluctantly disperses. The band gets back to playing.
PEARCEY
Ms Salix? Did you know about this individual’s condition? Is he a patient of yours?
ALBA
What’s that, Toby? Time for a walk?
JEROME
(excited)
Whuff!
PEARCEY
Ms Salix!
ALBA
Sorry, it’s so loud here! Let’s talk some other time! Come on, Holly.
HOLLY
(still giddy)
I’m okay!
Alba, Holly and Jerome rush off.
LORIA
Well? How’s that for excitement?
PEARCEY
His Majesty owes me a raise.
LORIA
Mmm hmm. Dinner?
PEARCEY
Yes, please.

EXT. HILLTOP, AFTER MIDNIGHT
Crickets. The party can be heard faintly in the distance. Withrow speaks in hushed whispers with a woman.
PARABEL
There you are.
WITHROW
Sorry I’m late. There was a… situation.
PARABEL
The moon is almost at its zenith. Did you bring the device?
WITHROW
Um… as I said, there was a tiny bit of an incident and… somebody stole it.
PARABEL
What?!
WITHROW
I got chased around. There was a whole thing, with a werewolf…
PARABEL
Why weren’t you keeping out of sight tonight?
WITHROW
Hey, a guy’s gotta make a living somehow.
PARABEL
Did you see who took it?
WITHROW
No. I must have dropped it when I was being chased.
PARABEL
You fool. I should have known better than to hire you.
WITHROW
Well, you wanted to summon a demon.
PARABEL
Can the ritual be done without the device?
WITHROW
It’s dangerous. I wouldn’t want to try—
MAGNUS
Why… hello.
PARABEL
(gasps)
WITHROW
(startled)
Magnus! What the…
MAGNUS
Hey, Withrow. How’s it going?
WITHROW
What are you doing here?
A rustle of grass as Magnus steps forward.
MAGNUS
Just getting some fresh air. Anyway, Withrow, dude, while you were running for your life, I noticed you dropped a little something on the ground.
WITHROW
Do you have it?
MAGNUS
Say, who’s your scary friend?
PARABEL
(disguising her voice)
None of your business, boy.
MAGNUS
Fair enough. Nice cloak.
Anyway, so here’s this little doodad…
He pulls it out of his pocket.
WITHROW
Thanks, kid. You’re saving my—
MAGNUS
Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.
PARABEL
Be careful with that!
MAGNUS
Now, my best guess is, this is some kind of deflector? Like, for detecting and dispelling magical barriers? As you would if, you know, you were summoning a demon from another plane?
PARABEL
Just hand it over.
MAGNUS
I’ve been reading up, man. I know things.
PARABEL
If you two are quite finished…
MAGNUS
Do I know you from somewhere?
PARABEL
No.
She takes a step back. Magnus follows.
MAGNUS
I totally do.
PARABEL
Stay away from me.
WITHROW
C’mon, never mind her. Give me the—
MAGNUS
Ha!
Magnus lunges forward and knocks Parabel’s hood back.
WITHROW
Magnus—
MAGNUS
(in disbelief)
Whoaaaa! It’s—you’re—
PARABEL
Yes. I am.
MAGNUS
You’re the Queen. You’re the actual mothergoosing Queen! What the heck is going on?
PARABEL
You will address me properly.
MAGNUS
Right. Right. Your Majesty, whatever. Sorry. What are you two up to?
PARABEL
Right now, we are about to deal with a stupid boy who has found out too much.
Mister Lee. Kill him.
MAGNUS
Ho ho! I’d like to see you try. Ha! Hoo!
He strikes a pose, then carries out a flurry of unarmed moves.
WITHROW
Look, kid. I don’t want to do this. I really, really don’t want to do this, but…
MAGNUS
Yeah?
WITHROW
Obliviscere!
A violent surge of magic.
MAGNUS
Aw, dude, that spell was sweet! Alba never… shows me anything… cool…
(gasps)
He falls to the ground.

Jerome wanders in from the back, barefoot.
JEROME
Ugh. Where am I?
ALBA
Good morning, Jerome.
JEROME
Oh! Morning, Alba! Hi Holly.
HOLLY
You should get some rest, Jerome. You had a busy night last night.
JEROME
I did? What was last night?
HOLLY
The Harvest Moon Faire?
JEROME
It was? How come I don’t remember it? Darn it, I was looking forward to it. I always seem to miss it for some reason…
ALBA
Jerome, we have some important news to tell you.
JEROME
Okay?
HOLLY
The first thing is, you should read this brochure I made!
JEROME
“Were It’s At”. Is that spelled right?
HOLLY
Read it! Read it!
JEROME
“Were It’s At. A guide for new and newly-discovered—”
(gasps)
Is this for real? I’m a…?
ALBA
I’m afraid so.
JEROME
This explains so much…
The front door opens and Magnus wanders in.
MAGNUS
Hey guys.
HOLLY
Hey Magnus! Did you have fun at the Faire last night?
MAGNUS
The Faire? Like, the Harvest Moon Faire?
HOLLY
Yes!
MAGNUS
…was last night?
HOLLY
Yes!
MAGNUS
You sure?
HOLLY
Pretty sure! Jerome turned into a werewolf and everything.
MAGNUS
Aw man. That would have been cool to see.
How come I don’t remember any of it?
JEROME
I don’t remember anything either. Magnus! Are you a werewolf?
MAGNUS
Am I…?
Maybe!
JEROME
Here, read this list of symptoms.
ALBA
Magnus is not a werewolf.
MAGNUS
Yeah? You don’t know.
ALBA
Catch.
She tosses him a small bottle, which he catches.
MAGNUS
What’s this?
ALBA
A bottle made of silver.
JEROME
(growls)
ALBA
You’re not a werewolf, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Aww! But… last night—
ALBA
It was the Harvest Moon. Half the town can’t remember what they did last night.
MAGNUS
Well, I’m sure I did something awesome. Dangit. That would be so cool. Hey, Jerome, do you think you could…?
JEROME
Huh?
MAGNUS
You know, just a little bite. Here. Right on the arm.
JEROME
You want me to bite you?
ALBA
No. Jerome, no biting. Magnus, get to work.
MAGNUS
You never let me have any fun.

ELI
Greetings! Kamusta! Góðan daginn! It’s Eli here, your writer and co-producer, bringing you Episode 5 of Alba Salix, Royal Physician, Volume 2.
Somehow we are already up to Episode 5, because time flies when you’re making podcasts, apparently. We’re coming up on our crazypants season finale next week. But don’t worry—there are more stories to come, believe you me.
First off, The End of Time and Other Bothers! If you haven’t heard it yet, that’s our improvised role-playing game spinoff, set mostly in the same world as Alba, full of fairy cakes and demons and utter lunacy. We’ve got a holiday special on the way, and a new season starting in January. Look for “Other Bothers” in your favourite podcast app.
Next up, it’s another season of The Axe & Crown. Gubbin, Stan and Betula will be back in the studio in the new year. We’ll have more about that soon on this podcast feed too… and in the meantime, if you support us on Patreon, you might catch a little scene featuring our favourite trolls, coming soon. And we’ve already begun planning Season 3 of Alba, of course, and it’s going to be a wild ride too.
So, tons of stories coming at you! If you want to help us get them made, and you’re able to, do consider joining us on Patreon. You’ll get regular updates, plus a ton of bonus content and other goodies, and you’ll get to hear all those new episodes first. Look for the Patreon link at albasalix.com.
That’s all for now. On with Episode 5!

INT. PALACE THRONE ROOM
A big wooden door opens and Gunther enters.
GUNTHER
(excited)
Hello, Minister. Hello, Alba.
PEARCEY
Your Majesty.
ALBA
Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
I’ve just been reviewing your proposal for this new School of Medicine.
PEARCEY
You read it?
I mean, thank you for reading it, Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
And I agree. We need to begin training a new generation of healers to keep this kingdom fit and well. A state-of-the-art facility for research and education. And I believe we should begin as soon as possible.
ALBA
That is good news.
PEARCEY
I can have my staff draw up a list of requirements for the building design…
GUNTHER
No need.
PEARCEY
Your Majesty?
GUNTHER
I’ve designed it already!
ALBA
(to herself)
I’m not going to say anything. I’m not going to say anything.
GUNTHER
It’s over here.
Behold!
Gunther strides over to a corner and whisks away a sheet.
ALBA
(sighs)
PEARCEY
It’s… very nice.
GUNTHER
Isn’t it? I’ve been using a brand-new tool—a gift from the Gnomish ambassador. It’s a kit with all these parts you can snap together to create “visualizations” of buildings, or whole streets… Look, there’s even little trees.
ALBA
Yes, the trees…
PEARCEY
…are lovely, Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
And now, we can simply pop down a piece of paper, and the quill magically draws up all the blueprints and the budget for us.
He does so. The quill begins sketching and writing at high speed.
PEARCEY
Why is it such a strange shape?
GUNTHER
It’s a unicorn! Known for their legendary powers of healing.
ALBA
Give me strength.
PEARCEY
Oh, it’s lying down. I was confused. So this tower here…
GUNTHER
Yes, that’s the head! I thought perhaps the horn could even light up magically.
ALBA
Ahh.
PEARCEY
Mmm.
They regard the building in silence.
ALBA
Well, I’m quite certain there’s no other building like this anywhere in the world.
GUNTHER
I know!
I have already signed a decree that construction will begin in the spring.
PEARCEY
Really! Your Majesty has the funding all ready?
GUNTHER
Ahh. In fact, that is why I’ve brought you here. We need to find the money to get the old shovels in the ground.
ALBA
Hopefully there’ll be more than just shovels.
GUNTHER
Oh, indeed. Shovels in the ground, bricks on top of the ground, a… roof on top of the bricks…
ALBA
Spoken like a brilliant architect, Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
So you two will need to coordinate and… uh, raise the funds from private sources.
PEARCEY
How much?
GUNTHER
According to the budget calculator… five hundred and forty thousand crowns.
PEARCEY
(a strangled noise)
ALBA
And perhaps there might be a few pennies left over for repairs to the existing House of Healing?
GUNTHER
Oh yes, we can throw that in too.
What I thought we could do is to hold a great big gala. The Queen herself will be the royal patron, and lead the fundraising campaign.
ALBA
Isn’t that lovely of her.
GUNTHER
And as Parabel is the founding patron, it will be called… the Queen Parabel School of Medicine.
ALBA
Of course it will. Why don’t you make a building that’s shaped like her, then?
GUNTHER
(gasps)
Alba, that’s brilliant. What was I thinking?
Ha! Unicorns indeed. I’m going to go and find Parabel right away!
He rushes out.
ALBA
And tell her to ask all her friends for money!

INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—RECEPTION
Pearcey’s heels echo around the room as she paces.
PEARCEY
(sighs)
Loria warned me there was something like this coming, but I had no idea it would be this bad.
Have you heard anything from the Queen yet?
ALBA
Nothing. She’s barely gone out in public lately, since, well…
PEARCEY
Since what? Is something wrong?
ALBA
You didn’t hear this from me, but she’s pregnant.
PEARCEY
Oh no. Is it far along? Do you think she’ll be able to carry out her duties as patron?
ALBA
She’ll be fine. The baby’s not due until April. But that doesn’t mean she’ll actually lift a finger to help us.
PEARCEY
It’s down to us, then. Half a million crowns for a building we didn’t ask for.
ALBA
I thought you’d be used to this sort of thing by now.
PEARCEY
And you know I’ll be the one to blame when it all goes horribly wrong.
(slowly building panic)
Oh gods, the swan boats. It’s the swan boats again…
ALBA
It’s not the swan boats.
PEARCEY
It is. I’m responsible for building someone else’s terrible idea, and I’m going to be the one who has to clean up all the blood afterward…
ALBA
Let’s keep it together. We just need a plan.
PEARCEY
(calming breaths)
Yes. A plan. All right.
Who is our main demographic? Wealthy patrons, I suppose. The nobility?
She takes out pen and paper and begins to jot notes.
ALBA
Her Majesty is still our best connection there.
PEARCEY
We might be better to focus on the wealthy merchants and industrialists, then.
ALBA
Looking to put their names on a prestigious project.
PEARCEY
And after all, they benefit from a healthy workforce.
ALBA
(sighs)
I didn’t become Royal Physician to go about begging for money.
PEARCEY
It wasn’t part of my job description either. But here we are.
Could your staff be any help to us?
ALBA
There’s a first time for everything.

EXT. DOORSTEP—DAY
Magnus knocks on the door. After a moment, it’s opened by a nervous old woman.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Yes? Can I help you?
MAGNUS
Hey, how are you, ma’am? My name is Magnus, and I’m here on behalf of the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health…
NEIGHBOUR 1
Never heard of it.
MAGNUS
Yeah, it’s a new thing. We’re raising money to build a new school for healers…
NEIGHBOUR 1
That all sounds very nice, but I haven’t got—
MAGNUS
Okay, look. Do you like being healthy?
NEIGHBOUR 1
I suppose so?
MAGNUS
Yeah, you do. Eating, breathing, having teeth? Not dying? All that good stuff?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Sure.
MAGNUS
Now, do you know what the number one threat to your health is?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Pony pox?
MAGNUS
Nope.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Goblin fever?
MAGNUS
Wrong again. It’s Liqui-Melt… ibium Syndrome.
NEIGHBOUR 1
You what?
MAGNUS
You haven’t heard of Liqui-Meltico Syndrome? It’s a tropical disease from the south. It’s transmitted by spiders.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Ugh!
MAGNUS
Right? Did you know that the average human inhales up to sixteen spiders every night?
NEIGHBOUR 1
No! We inhale them?
MAGNUS
They’re sneaky little bastards. And now that the disease is on the move, every one of those spiders might be a carrier.
NEIGHBOUR 1
How do I know if I’ve got it?
MAGNUS
Oh, you’ll know. Trust me, you’ll know. The disease actually starts liquefying soft tissues like your brain and eyeballs and all your organs. That’s why it’s called the Squirty Plague, see? And then all that goo starts leaking out of every orifice on your body.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Gods above.
MAGNUS
Of course, before all that happens, it starts with soreness and flu-like symptoms. Do you ever have soreness in your arms and legs, or your back, or…?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Well, yeah. I’m on my feet all day at the store. I just assumed it was from working long hours…
MAGNUS
Never assume. When you assume you make a soup out of your soft tissues.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Oh dear. I need to see a healer.
MAGNUS
You should. And you know what else you should do? Donate generously to the Queen Parabel School of Medicine. We take pledges, but cash is faster and easier.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Yes. Absolutely. Wow.
MAGNUS
Just know that you may well be saving a life. Your own.

PEARCEY
Good morning, team.
HOLLY
Hi Ms Pearcey!
ALBA
You have a “bad news” look. Don’t tell me.
PEARCEY
I just found out we won’t be able to use the Great Hall at the palace.
HOLLY
Aww! Why not?
PEARCEY
They’re still cleaning up from the ball they held in honour of Prince Aquarelian and his entourage.
HOLLY
Oh, I heard about that! Didn’t they have a great big water fight? That sounded like so much fun!
ALBA
It is an honoured custom amongst the mer-people.
HOLLY
Traditions like that can be so wonderful for bringing everyone together.
PEARCEY
Not to mention costing several thousand crowns in water damage. They’re still wringing out all the tapestries.
ALBA
Well, next time the mer-people visit, perhaps His Majesty will think to host them down at the harbour.
PEARCEY
(sighs)
They brought hoses.
ALBA
So do we have another venue?
PEARCEY
The only place that’s available Friday night is the Old Coach House.
HOLLY
Yay, that’s a pretty building!
ALBA
A bit… rough and ready.
HOLLY
It has a simple home-spun charm.
PEARCEY
They’re still charging us a fortune for the booking. We’re hardly going to have anything left for food and drink.
HOLLY
No problem! I love cooking. And I can bring some of my fairy friends to help out as well!
PEARCEY
Hmm. How many friends are we talking about?
ALBA
No. Minister, think about what you’re saying.
HOLLY
It’ll save us money. We fairies are experts at foraging for wild food. And we can sing and dance while we cook!
ALBA
Can I also add: no.
PEARCEY
Well, we should still consider it, given our budget.
Holly, if you and your friends would provide us a full ingredient list ahead of time. We have to be aware of dietary restrictions.
HOLLY
Oh, but I always improvise. You know, add a little bit of whatever’s in season…
ALBA
Which is how we ended up having to fix a dozen people who ate your ginger snaps and suddenly grew tails.
HOLLY
The tails were cute!
PEARCEY
(alarmed)
Or perhaps you can help with decorating instead.
HOLLY
I can do that! We’ll fill every corner of the Old Coach House with flowers.
PEARCEY
As long as they aren’t poisonous, allergenic or covered in thorns.
HOLLY
Well…
PEARCEY
Nothing’s going to go wrong. Is that clear? No tails! No swan boats! Not again!
ALBA
I will provide a list of safe flower varieties.
PEARCEY
Good. Good.
HOLLY
Okay. Is there anything else I can do to help? Please?
PEARCEY
Let’s talk about the gala later. How has the door-to-door campaign been going?
ALBA
We’re up to forty-five hundred crowns.
PEARCEY
A bit slower than I’d hoped.
ALBA
Well, there were a few hiccups early on… but we fixed them.

EXT. DOORSTEP
Magnus knocks on the door. It’s opened by a gruff older man.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yes? Hello?
MAGNUS
Hey, how are you, sir? My name is Magnus, and I’m here on behalf of the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health…
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yeah, I have no idea what that is.
MAGNUS
We are building a brand new school so we can teach lots more healers and heal lots more people. Sounds great, right? Right. They’re gonna be out there fixing bones and smacking babies and removing unwanted tails…
NEIGHBOUR 2
Removing what?
MAGNUS
So you can see why your donation is so important.
NEIGHBOUR 2
“My donation.” Yeah, right, buddy. Let me guess, you only take cash.
MAGNUS
(he struggles for a moment)
Why… no. I am not allowed to accept cash donations.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yeah? Why not?
MAGNUS
Because my boss doesn’t trust me not to steal the donations for myself.
Wait, what the hell is going on?
NEIGHBOUR 2
What kinda scam is this?
MAGNUS
Yes, I totally came here to scam you. Dammit! Stop asking me questions!
NEIGHBOUR 2
Is this some kind of weird double bluff?
What’s your name, kid? Who do you work for?
MAGNUS
Magnus of Hezelford. I work for Alba Salix, the Royal Physician… who apparently slipped me a truth potion before I went out this morning. The damn witch!
NEIGHBOUR 2
You work for the Royal Physician.
MAGNUS
Yes! I’m her apprentice. Look, I’ve taken up enough of your time—
Magnus starts backing away, but the man grabs him by the arm.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Not so fast. I’m turning you in, you little fraud.
MAGNUS
Ow! Let go!
NEIGHBOUR 2
“Ministry of Magical Affairs”. What kind of fool do you think I am?
MAGNUS
A big one, I figured, but apparently you’re much smarter than you—ow! It’s true! Everything I’ve said is true. The Ministry, the school thing…
NEIGHBOUR 2
You said it was a scam.
MAGNUS
No, the fundraising part is real, I was just stealing donations.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Well, you picked the wrong guy to try and rip off.
MAGNUS
No argument here!
NEIGHBOUR 2
I was a sergeant in the town guard. You know what we did with little creeps like you?
MAGNUS
Ow! I warn you, I know many unarmed moves that I hope look intimidating but actually kind of suck in a real fight—dammit!
NEIGHBOUR 2
I guess the question is, do I report this to your boss, or should I turn you in to the town guard?
MAGNUS
Town guard, definitely town guard.
NEIGHBOUR 2
All right, back to the witch it is.
MAGNUS
I’m begging you, man! Turn me in!

INT. BALLROOM
Holly flutters across the room as she works. We hear rustling, like leaves, and an unsteady creaking sound.
HOLLY
(singing)
Welcome, welcome, you’re just in time… to help us build a brand new school, la la la!
Magnus is working, closer at hand.
MAGNUS
Argh! Dammit… Holly, are you sure these are the “safe” flowers?
HOLLY
Magnus! I’m ready for the next garland. Come on! We need to finish!
She touches down beside Magnus.
MAGNUS
Just hold your horses. I’ve got blisters from stringing all these stupid garlands.
HOLLY
Well, if you didn’t want to be stringing stupid garlands in the stupid ballroom, you shouldn’t have tried stealing money from our donors.
MAGNUS
Stupid donors. Stupid retired cop donors.
Here’s your garland. Are we done now?
HOLLY
Stay put. I’m not supposed to let you out of my sight.
Holly flies up and starts tying the garland.
HOLLY
Wait, it’s not going to reach. Magnus! The garland’s too short!
MAGNUS
Yeah, well, I ran out of twine! Look, just tie it to one of the arms of the chandelier.
HOLLY
But then it won’t be symmetrical.
MAGNUS
So, do the same thing on the other side.
HOLLY
We can’t waste any more time. Ms Pearcey’s going to be back here any minute.
MAGNUS
I know! Look—go ahead and tie it off and we’ll fix it later.
HOLLY
Okay, okay.
Holly flutters about.
MAGNUS
See? It’s fine. It’s on the far side, so she won’t even notice.
Holly finishes and touches down.
HOLLY
There.
MAGNUS
Nice.
HOLLY
All right. Let’s start setting up the tables.
MAGNUS
Sure. Give me a minute. I just want to enjoy the feeling of having arms, while I still can.
HOLLY
The garlands do look pretty good from here!
MAGNUS
Right?
Well, I guess we better get on with—
Part of the chandelier gives way with a groan. The garland rustles, and metal and cut glass smash on the floor.
HOLLY
Aaaa!
MAGNUS
Oh boy.
HOLLY
Get a broom!
They run around trying to clean up.
MAGNUS
I told you we shouldn’t have tied it to the chandelier.
HOLLY
You…!
She hits him.
MAGNUS
Ow! Hey! Physical assault in the workplace!
The door opens, and Pearcey enters with an armful of flowers.
PEARCEY
Holly, Magnus, I’ve brought the flowers for the centrepieces. How are you doing with the…
(she notices the mess)
…tables?
MAGNUS
Hey… hello, Madam Minister.
PEARCEY
(icy silence, then)
Well. There’s another five hundred crowns down the privy.
HOLLY
I’m sorry, Ms Pearcey!
MAGNUS
It’s all good. This gala is supposed to bring in money. That’s kind of the whole idea, right?
PEARCEY
Yes. We’re expecting fifty of the richest people in the kingdom to come and give us money. And look at this place. Honestly. A broken chandelier. Stems and leaves and glass everywhere.
HOLLY
We’re cleaning up!
MAGNUS
It’s all under control, your ministerialness.
PEARCEY
All right. Deep breaths. Let’s take it one step at a time—
The other arm of the chandelier falls off with a crash. Everyone gives a shout of alarm.
HOLLY
Aaa! Watch out!
PEARCEY
(sighs)
MAGNUS
Well hey, at least it’s symmetrical again.
PEARCEY
Get. This. Cleaned. Up.
HOLLY
Yes, Ms Pearcey.
They start sweeping up.
MAGNUS
So… those new flowers sure look nice.
PEARCEY
Yes. The rest are on the way from the florist. For the love of Loxsyn, don’t break all the vases as well.
MAGNUS
(under his breath, mocking)
“Don’t break all the vases as well…”
HOLLY
Wait… these are orange vipertongues.
PEARCEY
That’s right.
HOLLY
They’re not on Alba’s list!
PEARCEY
Yes they are…
HOLLY
No they’re not! Who ordered them?
PEARCEY
I did. It was… a special request.
MAGNUS
Vipertongues, huh? Do they cause swift and painful death?
HOLLY
They can cause mild sinus allergies in some humans.
MAGNUS
Boo. You can’t name something that lame after a viper.
PEARCEY
All right. We don’t have time to change them. Just set up the tables, please.
HOLLY
All right, but if someone sneezes themselves to death, don’t say I didn’t warn you!

GUNTHER
Parabel, darling…
PARABEL
Yes, dear.
GUNTHER
Why aren’t you getting ready for the gala tonight? I thought you’d be excited to spend the evening with your friends… see and be seen, enjoy yourself.
PARABEL
I don’t think I can.
GUNTHER
Why ever not?
PARABEL
I’m not feeling well.
GUNTHER
Because of the baby?
PARABEL
Yes… the baby.
GUNTHER
You could put in a brief appearance, surely. You had that lovely pink dress picked out…
PARABEL
It doesn’t fit any more.
GUNTHER
We just had it adjusted! Come now. Let’s see.
PARABEL
It doesn’t fit.
GUNTHER
Surely the baby’s not growing that fast. Is it?
PARABEL
Look.
She stands up.
GUNTHER
Oh. Oh good heavens. I could swear you were half that size only yesterday.
PARABEL
Why, thank you, darling.
GUNTHER
I didn’t mean it as a criticism! That is a royal baby in there, after all.
PARABEL
As I said, the dress doesn’t fit.
GUNTHER
This is happening rather quickly, isn’t it? Should we be worried?
PARABEL
No, no, Alba says it’s just a… super-expansionary pregnancy, I think she called it.
GUNTHER
Oh dear, that does sound dangerous.
PARABEL
Oh, no. She says it’s nothing to be worried about.
GUNTHER
Ah, good! Then you can go to the gala.
PARABEL
It’s just so uncomfortable.
GUNTHER
Just for a few minutes.
PARABEL
Very, very, uncomfortable.
GUNTHER
Then we’d better get Alba back here to see you.
PARABEL
Not that uncomfortable!
GUNTHER
Parabel, dear, your people need you. It’ll be your name on this new building, and your face, smiling down at every bright young student, every loopy old wizard who steps through its doors!
PARABEL
(softening)
Yes.
GUNTHER
Not to mention the rumours that will spread if you don’t show up.
PARABEL
(sighs)
All right, darling. I’ll go.
GUNTHER
Thank you. We’ll get the tailors in here right away to see to that dress. You’ll look magnificent.
PARABEL
I always do…
GUNTHER
Courage, my treasure. You’ve done this twice before!
PARABEL
Yes, that’s true.

PEARCEY
Where is everyone? The musicians are late…
HOLLY
I’m sure they’ll be here any minute.
MAGNUS
Pff. Musicians are always late.
PEARCEY
The Palace caterers are nowhere to be found. To say nothing of—
The door opens. Alba hurries in from the rain—it’s pouring outside.
PEARCEY
Ahh, there you are.
ALBA
Yes. Sorry, there was an emergency back at the House of Healing.
HOLLY
Oh no! What happened?
ALBA
An outbreak of pony pox.
PEARCEY
Well, get changed. Holly, I need you to fly up to the Palace and find out where on earth the royal caterers are.
HOLLY
Sure thing!
ALBA
No, no, don’t bother. I know exactly where they are.
PEARCEY
Where—oh no.
ALBA
Yup.
PEARCEY
Oh, no, no, no…
HOLLY
Well, don’t keep us in suspense. Where are they?
ALBA
At the House of Healing, recovering from a massive bout of pony pox.
HOLLY
Oh my gosh! All of them?
PEARCEY
I don’t suppose any of them are well enough to cook?
ALBA
And infect all our guests?
PEARCEY
Oh no, no, no.
(to Magnus and Holly)
Well, don’t just stand there, you two—get to work. Cooking!
MAGNUS
Us?
HOLLY
You got it! Cooking is my most favourite thing ever.
MAGNUS
Couldn’t we just make the dinner appear by magic? Like the Sorceror General used to do for banquets and things?
ALBA
That was all illusion. Someone had to actually make the food first.
MAGNUS
Great. So we’re screwed, in other words.
ALBA
Magnus, I have had a long day that is only getting longer. I need you two to go into that kitchen, find something on the menu that you think you can cook, and cook it.
HOLLY
You got it! We’ll take it from here.
PEARCEY
Good. Alba, get dressed. Our guests will be arriving soon, and then we’ll have to… mingle.
(she shudders)
ALBA
Yes. Good luck with that.
PEARCEY
Oh no. You’ve got to do your fair share too, Ms Salix. Come on. I’ve written out some sample donor conversations to practice.
ALBA
Fine.

Holly hums as she fetches pots and utensils out of cupboards.
MAGNUS
“Asparagus Galinoise with a truffle infusion over steamed mastodon sprouts”?
Holly, do you understand anything on this menu?

Forget the menu. Let’s make it up as we go!
MAGNUS
Because that usually ends well.

What a terrific evening, Your Ladyship. Best party of the year.
PEARCEY
Thank you. It was so good of you to come.
PRESTON
Say, is something burning?
PEARCEY
I’m sure it’s fine.
Holly flies by.
HOLLY
Good evening, Your Ladyship! Hello, unknown gentleman!
PRESTON
Fairy servants! That’s a nice touch.
(to Holly)
Hello, darling.
HOLLY
Would you like a glass of sparkling wine?
PRESTON
I would love some.
PEARCEY
Thank you, Holly.

Is everything all right in the kitchen?
HOLLY
Perfectly fine!
PRESTON

Whew! That’s certainly different. A bit… I want to say, cabbagey?
PEARCEY
(sniffs)
Good heavens. Yes, there are certain… vegetal notes to it.
Holly, what on earth is this?
HOLLY
Fairy moonshine! It’s wholesome and nourishing. Contains twelve essential nutrients required to build stronger wings and add shine to your hair. If you had wings, I mean. Only the best for our wonderful donors!
PEARCEY
(whispers)
You made moonshine out of our dinner?
HOLLY
We had a problem with the hors d’oeuvres. Magnus is moving on to the soup course.
PEARCEY

PRESTON

Boy, this stuff does kind of grow on you, doesn’t it.
PEARCEY
Indeed! Well! I’m sure our good chef will have plenty more wonderful surprises up his sleeve tonight.

Yes! Yes, he will.

Holly? What is on fire?
HOLLY
I’ll be right back!
PEARCEY
Oh dear.
ALBA
Good evening.
PEARCEY
Ah, Ms Salix. Please meet Mister Edgar Preston. Mister Preston, this is Ms Alba Salix, the Royal Physician.
PRESTON
It’s an honour, Ms Salix.
PEARCEY
Mister Preston is one of our most generous donors.
ALBA
That’s wonderful.
PRESTON
Well, magic is our business, you know, and we’re very interested in giving back to the magical community…
ALBA
What business would that be?
PRESTON
I am the head of Mysticorp Energy, ma’am.
ALBA
(suddenly dark)
Mysticorp—oh. Yes.
PRESTON
The kingdom’s largest exporter of mystical energy!
ALBA
I’m aware. Extracting energy straight from the loo lines isn’t the safest of practices.
PEARCEY
(whispers)
Ms Salix…
PRESTON
We take every precaution—
ALBA
What was it now? Two major spills in the last year?
PRESTON
Now listen, those were sabotage by our competitors.
ALBA
Not to mention the earthquakes, and the rain of skunks back in April.
PEARCEY
Well! I must say, it was very good of Mister Preston to attend our little fundraiser, especially on such a stormy night.
PRESTON
Oh, it’s my pleasure. At least it’s only raining water, eh? Heh heh.
PEARCEY
We are certainly very grateful for his presence and his company’s generous donation. Aren’t we, Ms Salix?
ALBA
Yes. Yes, that is very good of him.
PEARCEY
It’s been lovely chatting with you, sir.
PRESTON
Likewise!
PEARCEY
(laughs politely then, to Alba:)
Why do you have to provoke our donors?
ALBA
Force of habit.
PEARCEY
Can you wait to do it until after our school is built?
ALBA
Yes, you’re right, I’m sorry.

Aren’t those flowers lovely, Mister Preston?

Oh, yes, gorgeous.

Nothing! Everything’s under control now.
HOLLY
I think the guests are getting hungry.
MAGNUS
I’m working on it! I’m trying to get an assembly line going here. So we just place the vegetables here. The knives chop them and lift them into the pot…
HOLLY
What, by themselves? Oh no, Magnus, don’t you dare try cooking with magic.
MAGNUS
We can’t feed all those people by hand! Watch, it’s gonna be fine.
(tries to remember)
Uh… so it’s… Nimis multi pomari!
Shing! Several knives spring into the air and hang there, clinking softly.
HOLLY
Aaa! Magnus, if you’re going to use magic, use it for things that don’t involve knives!
MAGNUS
It’s okay! It’s okay. Um… I dunno why they’re just floating there.
Nimis multi… pomarii?
The knives all begin chopping violently. Magnus and Holly both shout in alarm.
MAGNUS
Okay! That worked better than I expected.
Holly makes for the door as the knives pick up speed.

Ms Salix, this is Lord Croncible, the shipping magnate.
CRONCIBLE

Oh, it is a pleasure to meet you, fair lady!
ALBA
Lord Croncible. It’s so good of you to lend us your support.
CRONCIBLE
It is my duty and pleasure.
(chuckles)
ALBA
(feigning great interest)
So. How is the shipping business? Sail any good ships lately?
CRONCIBLE
Oh, it’s about more than just ships these days!
ALBA
You don’t say!
CRONCIBLE
Yes, you see… these days the smart money is in carpets.
PEARCEY
Oh dear.
ALBA
What, shipping by carpet?
CRONCIBLE
Absolutely! Those Niamondese flying carpets are the wave of the future.
PEARCEY
Ah, how fascinating!
ALBA
Ms. Pearcey, didn’t you issue a report on freight carpets while you were Minister of Transportation?
PEARCEY
Oh, yes, just some preliminary findings…
ALBA
I think the conclusion was “inefficient and a risk to cargo and crew”.
CRONCIBLE
Oh, no, no, no, now there ya go. These modern ones are perfectly safe, dear lady. They’ve got bracing and active damping. We’ve even got side rails… No more being dumped overboard when a breeze comes up!
PEARCEY
Yes, you see, Ms Salix? Probably worth another look.
ALBA
Yes, I’m sure you’re right.
My, aren’t these flowers lovely?
PEARCEY
(instantly)
Don’t smell the flowers.
Does that mean you’ve solved the weight ratio problem, Your Lordship?
ALBA
Yes, didn’t I read that the bracing is so heavy they can barely carry a single banana?
CRONCIBLE
Bah! Simple technical challenges. The fourth-generation carpets use hollow bracing, so now we can carry a substantially much greater payload!
ALBA
Two bananas?

That’s about right.

How does it taste?

No idea. But hey, there’s enough for everybody!

Well, can you stop all the knives and things so I can try some?

Yeah, see if it needs some spices or whatever.

ALBA
Thank you both for being here.
LORD JONEWOOD
Yes! Well, it’s such an important cause, you know. I think it is such an imperative to care for the most vulnerable in our society, and orphans are among the most—
LADY JONEWOOD

Dearest, this is the House of Healing gala.
LORD JONEWOOD
Oh yes, of course. It’s Friday. Silly me. Uh, yes! Orphans are among the most likely to contract horrible diseases.

Well, I suppose you’re not wrong.
LORD JONEWOOD
What’s that dreadful one with the eyeballs? And the extra teeth all over the place?
ALBA
The Biting Blight.
LADY JONEWOOD
Ugh! That does sound horrid.

Horrid!

Well! Speaking of horrid, how about tonight’s weather?
LADY JONEWOOD
Oh, it’s frightful out there! I was just saying—
A hush falls.

His Majesty, King Gunther the Third!
Her Majesty, Queen Parabel!
A smattering of polite applause, and a few sneezes.
PEARCEY
Oh my. That’s odd.

Isn’t it, though?
LORD JONEWOOD
Oh. Good heavens, I didn’t realize Her Majesty was… with child again.
LADY JONEWOOD
No, she’s isn’t—oh! She is! Dear me, when did that happen? I saw her only a week or two ago and there was no sign whatsoever.
LORD JONEWOOD
I say, this isn’t some wild new fashion in dresses, is it?
ALBA
No, that’s all her. Well, her, plus what looks one very big baby.
PEARCEY
Oh dear. I’d have postponed the gala if I’d known. I had no idea she was so far along.

She wasn’t.

Your Majesty. I say, does this serve as an official announcement?

Announcement?
LORD JONEWOOD
Of your happy state? Of expectancy? Of a third child? Oh dear. Ha ha. Unless it’s some kind of dreadful bloat. I know women of a certain age are particularly susceptible to hyperinflation of the—

You must be so relieved! How far along are you?

Eleven weeks?!

Oh my. Is that a lot?

To hell with the speeches. I need to examine you, immediately!

Ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests.

Nothing is wrong.
ALBA
Yes, your being nine months pregnant, two and a half months in, is perfectly normal.

It wasn’t supposed to happen like this…

What wasn’t?
From down the hall comes a smash and clatter of cutlery. Magnus pokes his head out the kitchen door. Parabel takes the opportunity to slip away down the hall.

ALBA
Sort them out. I have a medical emergency.

Yes, we are up to our season finale and—okay, fair warning, this one gets a bit intense, so brace yourself—check the show notes if you’re concerned.
In the meantime, I’ve got some people to thank, starting with our wonderful cast, who made us laugh and cry in the booth and made this series a joy to record. Thanks also to our amazing special guests this season, who were a total blast to record with. We love you all so much.
Thank you to our fabulous sponsors this season. And thank you to all our generous and lovely donors on Indiegogo and Patreon for making this all possible.

I say “we”, but… thank you to my partner, co-producer and co-writer Sean, who has really pushed me to go bigger and bolder with our stories this season, and who has provided so much support day in and day out. Thank you, dear.
And finally, one more kind of unexpected thank you. So my computer pooped out last week. Just went pfft! Screen went dark, wouldn’t start up again, and made for some extremely panicked moments.

It is I, Queen Parabel of Farloria—

Yes, I am. If we could get down to business.

Yeah, it’s all clicking into place now.
All right. Lay it on me.
PARABEL
I am with child.
ATEN-ABEN
Nice. Congrats.
PARABEL
Alba tells me the child will be a boy.
ATEN-ABEN
Yep, it’s looking that way.
PARABEL
Which would make him heir apparent, and void our enemies’ claim to the throne. The moment they learn a crown prince has been born, his life will be in mortal peril.
ATEN-ABEN
Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense.
PARABEL
But you have power over destiny.
ATEN-ABEN
I can push the world toward one future or another. If you wanted a girl, you should have talked to me before you went and got preggers.

Well, what good are you, then?!
Mister Lee, couldn’t you have summoned me a proper demon?

It was short notice. Everybody’s booked up on the full moon. It was this guy or Sovono-gargh, the god of snails.

PARABEL
How powerful?

Powerful enough that no one can harm him. Your boy shall have all your magic—all the magic of your whole bloodline put together. I can make him so powerful that the land of his birth shall never fall to its enemies so long as he lives.

Ow! Why you nasty little…! Let me taste your soup!
She smacks the snapping lid with a ladle.
HOLLY
Gimme. Come on!
Magnus, now! The lid!
Magnus runs over and grabs the lid.
MAGNUS
Ha! Got it.
HOLLY
Thanks!
MAGNUS
Ow, ow, it’s hot it’s hot it’s hot!
Holly stirs the “soup”.
HOLLY
Hold onto it!
Hey, this isn’t soup, it’s just hot water with some onions in it.
MAGNUS
The knives stole the rest of the ingredients. They’ve been hoarding them all in the top cupboard.
HOLLY
What? Why?
MAGNUS
How should I know? Stupid knives.
A dozen knives go shing!
MAGNUS
Sorry, I mean, very nice, shiny knives. You’re all super great and I think we should be friends!
HOLLY
Whoa, look out! Plates incoming!
The plates clink together as they close in.
MAGNUS
We’re surrounded.
HOLLY
(sings)
Hello bowls! Hello plates!
MAGNUS
What are you doing?
HOLLY
I don’t know—maybe they like music?
(sings)
What’s wrong? Was it something you ate?
The plates rattle louder.
MAGNUS
I don’t think they like music.
HOLLY
Let’s back away slowly.
CUT TO:
INT. BALLROOM
Anxious chatter.
GUNTHER
We’ll be back on track in just a second. The Royal Physician has gone off to look after Parabel. She has everything under control.
The doors burst open and Holly and Magnus tumble out into the ballroom, screaming and pursued by cutlery. A few guests scream as well.
GUNTHER
What on earth?
PEARCEY
Magnus! Holly! What is this?
MAGNUS
We’re having some minor technical issues in the kitchen.
HOLLY
Magnus! Make them stop!
PEARCEY
Why are there forks and knives following you?
The knives follow, with whispery sounds of metal on metal.
MAGNUS
(crawling backwards)
See, that’s a long story that hopefully I will live to tell you later.
(whimpers)
Nice cutlery!
C’mon, you wouldn’t hurt the one who brought you to life? Would you?
A tense silence. Then the knives and forks all abruptly crash to the ground. Magnus and Holly gasp in relief.
HOLLY
So, who’s hungry?
MUSIC STING
INT. STOREROOM
The storm rages outside.
PARABEL
Alba… Don’t let him near me. Don’t let him hurt the baby.
ATEN-ABEN
I would never hurt the baby. I’m simply escorting him to his new home.
ALBA
Begone, demon!
ATEN-ABEN
Go ahead. Hit me with your best shot.
ALBA
Aten-Aben, diabolum! Aten-Aben, exeas! Aten-Aben, effugare!
She summons a swirling magic wind, but it fizzles out to nothing.
ATEN-ABEN
(laughs)
Somebody a bit short on power?
ALBA
Is this your doing?
ATEN-ABEN
I am only following Her Majesty’s wishes.
ALBA
Parabel…
PARABEL
He promised my son would be the most powerful wizard alive.
ATEN-ABEN
And he will be! But you can’t just create that much power out of nowhere. It’s much easier to borrow. From the family, as it were.
ALBA
You’ve given all our power to the baby.
ATEN-ABEN
Yup.
ALBA
That’s too much for one person to handle. You’re endangering him. And everyone around him.
PARABEL
You didn’t tell me any of this!
ATEN-ABEN
You didn’t ask.
PARABEL
And now you’re here to take him away?
ATEN-ABEN
He’s going to be quite the star back home.
PARABEL
You promised he would be the defender of Farloria.
ATEN-ABEN
Mmmmnope, I don’t recall saying anything about Farloria. I believe it was: “The land of his birth shall never fall to its enemies so long as he lives.”
PARABEL
But we’re in Farloria.
ATEN-ABEN
Yes, but… shhh.
They fall silent. The wind howls fiercely. The walls of the building begin to creak and groan.
ATEN-ABEN
That’s our ride.
Wood splinters. The whole building shakes violently.
ATEN-ABEN
(laughs)
PARABEL
What are you doing?
ATEN-ABEN
The child will be born in my kingdom.
The walls groan and crack.
ATEN-ABEN
It’s pretty nice, as hell dimensions go. Good neighbours. Spectacular scenery. Warm all year round. He’s gonna love it.
Come on, let’s go.
Bricks crumble and wood splinters as the building lifts off into the air.
CUT TO:
INT. BALLROOM
Crashing and creaking. Guests tumble to the floor as the building sways and furniture slides across the room. Gale-force winds shake the walls.
LADY JONEWOOD
What’s happening?!
LORD JONEWOOD
Dear me, it’s quite the storm out there now, isn’t it?
LADY JONEWOOD
I should say it is. It’s lifting us right into the air!
GUNTHER
Oh dear. Parabel! Has anyone seen the Queen? Darling, where are you?
He stumbles out to the hall.
PEARCEY
No! Your Majesty!
(too late—she groans)
Everyone! Try to grab onto a wall. Make your way up here to the stage so you don’t get hit by the furniture. Hold on to each other for safety.
HOLLY
Magnus! You didn’t magically animate the whole building, did you?
MAGNUS
Are you kidding? I barely managed to levitate some knives.
HOLLY
Which nearly killed us.
Aten-Aben’s amplified voice rings out.
ATEN-ABEN
Your Majesties, ladies, gentlemen… This is your captain speaking, welcoming you aboard this nonstop flight from Grandville to the hell dimension of Qwaytox. Please stay seated. Keep your soles on the floor. You may experience some turbulence as we make our ascent.
Screams as the room lurches.
MAGNUS
See? He said “hell dimension”. We’re being stolen away by demons! I’ve got nothing to do with it!
HOLLY
Then why have your eyes gone red?
MAGNUS
The kitchen was kinda smoky?
HOLLY
Glowing red.
MAGNUS
Whatever. You’ve been drinking too much moonshine.
HOLLY
Also… you’re floating two feet off the floor.
MAGNUS
I’m what? Whoa! What the hell?
HOLLY
I told you. I think you’re possessed or something!
MAGNUS
Ha! How cool is this?! I wonder if I can fly?
A whoosh. Magnus cries out as he runs smack into the wall.
HOLLY
Magnus!
MAGNUS
(panting)
Ow. Okay. I’m okay. Just… stuck to the wall, apparently.
LORD JONEWOOD
I say, this is a bit more exciting than the Jackalope Sanctuary fundraiser, what?
HOLLY
Magnus, what did you do?!
MAGNUS
I swear, it wasn’t me!
EXT. FOREST, MIDNIGHT
A discordant shimmer of magic.
ATEN-ABEN
It is done.
PARABEL
Just like that?
ATEN-ABEN
Yes. All that remains is for you to await the birth.
PARABEL
Good. Good.
WITHROW
So… are we all done here?
ATEN-ABEN
Just one question.
PARABEL
Yes, O demon.
ATEN-ABEN
There’s a boy lying in the bushes.
WITHROW
There’s—what? No…
PARABEL
(hisses)
I thought you said you hid him!
WITHROW
I did!
ATEN-ABEN
I can sense his body heat.
Who is this?
WITHROW
The kid? Oh, he’s nobody important. I already made him forget what he saw tonight.
MAGNUS
(snores)
PARABEL
And you’re absolutely sure about that? If Alba finds out…
ATEN-ABEN
What’s this about Alba?
PARABEL
Oh, nothing…
(struck by a sudden thought)
Would you care for a sacrifice? Would that help with the baby’s destiny?
WITHROW
No, no! If Magnus goes missing, Alba’s gonna start figuring things out.
ATEN-ABEN
Does this boy work for her?
WITHROW
He’s her apprentice.
ATEN-ABEN
Is he really! And she’s the Royal Physician now, yes?
PARABEL
Yes. Yes, she is.
ATEN-ABEN
Well then, this should work out perfectly.
PARABEL
Yes?
ATEN-ABEN
When it comes time for the baby to be born…
A magical shimmer.
MAGNUS
(gasps in his sleep)
ATEN-ABEN
young Magnus here shall assist with the delivery.
FADE TO:
INT. BALLROOM
MAGNUS
Seriously, all I did was float some dishes. I can’t fly a whole building full of people.
HOLLY
Try it, though! Maybe… think about veering to the left?
MAGNUS
Veering to the left… veering…!
No.
HOLLY
No, really, really concentrate on it.
MAGNUS
All right, all right.
(grunts through gritted teeth)
The whole building creaks. A few screams from the guests.
HOLLY
There! There it is!
MAGNUS
(in sudden agony)
Aghhh!
HOLLY
Oh geez. Magnus, are you okay?
MAGNUS
(groans)
Okay, maybe you’re right. It feels like I’m being pulled through the air towards something. But I can’t control it. Holly… it’s… the second I try, it’s like I’m being stabbed in both ears!
HOLLY
Okay. Okay, deep breaths.
MAGNUS
(calming)
Aw, man…
HOLLY
Just… stay put. I’m going to go find Alba.
She flies off.
MAGNUS
I’m stuck to this wall. Where am I gonna go?
I mean, besides Hell.
MUSIC STING
INT. STOREROOM
ALBA
So why don’t you just transport her to your dimension? Why fly a whole building all the way across the planar convergence?
ATEN-ABEN
Style, my good woman.
ALBA
You don’t have the power to do it yourself.
ATEN-ABEN
(caught out)
I’m flying the building, aren’t I?
ALBA
Are you?
ATEN-ABEN
Not long now! We should be crossing out of this dimension in just a few minutes. How’s the patient?
PARABEL
(under her breath)
The patient will see you burn in your own hellfire.
ALBA
She’s fine.
ATEN-ABEN
Excellent. Still a good while between contractions? Can’t have the baby arrive until we’re safely on terra inferna.
PARABEL
So my child will be king in Hell?
ATEN-ABEN
Oh yes. My home country, to begin with, but with his power we could rule whole continents.
PARABEL
And what’s to become of me, then?
GUNTHER
(through the door)
Parabel? Parabel, are you in there?
PARABEL
Gunther!
GUNTHER
(through the door)
Parabel! I’m coming.
The door rattles, but it’s locked.
ATEN-ABEN
Oh, no, no, no.
This simply will not do.
PARABEL
Gunther!
Gunther takes a running start. The door bursts open and he tumbles into the room.
PARABEL
(gasps)
Oh my.
GUNTHER
Darling! You’re safe.
ALBA
Gunther, run!
GUNTHER
Why? What’s going on?
ATEN-ABEN
The witch is right. We can’t have the husband present.
Gunther strides over.
GUNTHER
Who on earth are you? Explain yourself, sir!
ATEN-ABEN
Am I right, Alba? Men—they always think they can handle it, and halfway through they faint, just like that.
He snaps his fingers. A sharp crackle of magical energy and Gunther collapses to the floor with a groan.
PARABEL
Gunther! No!
ALBA
Gunther!
PARABEL
(cold fury)
What have you done to him?
ATEN-ABEN
He’s just asleep, probably.
What does it matter?
PARABEL
That is my husband. The King of Farloria. Father of my child.
ATEN-ABEN
And no harm will come to him if you behave yourself.
PARABEL
(steely)
Yes. Of course.
Alba has moved over to examine Gunther.
ALBA
He’s breathing.
ATEN-ABEN
Told you.
ALBA
Hmm. His Majesty’s pupils look normal. I think he’ll be all right.
PARABEL
Well, that’s something.
HOLLY
(whispers)
Alba!
ALBA
(startled gasp, then, in a barely audible whisper)
Holly. Get out of sight.
ATEN-ABEN
What’s that?
ALBA
Nothing.
ATEN-ABEN
Who are you talking to?
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY—CONTINUOUS
We hear the roar of the wind, and Holly’s breathing, very close. The voices of Parabel, Alba and Aten-Aben emerge from the room.
ALBA
No one. Just myself. Clearly this tense situation is getting to me.
Holly’s wings flutter as she flies up to the rafters.
ATEN-ABEN
There had better not be anyone out in the hall.
As he speaks, he pokes his head out the door. Holly holds her breath.
ATEN-ABEN
Hmph. I could have sworn I heard someone.
He slams the door. The voices are muffled now.
ALBA
I told you. It’s just me and the voices in my head.
ATEN-ABEN
You talk too much.
ALBA
We do, don’t we Parabel? We’re so fairy talkative. Fairy, fairy talkative.
PARABEL
What’s that supposed to mean?
ALBA
It would be fairy good indeed and help people…
HOLLY
(gasps)
ALBA
…if you were to get hold of your tongue.
PARABEL
What? Do you think I should have been the quiet and dutiful little girl, while you lectured me at every turn?
ATEN-ABEN
Both of you be quiet.
ALBA
I’m just saying. Parabel just has a tongue like a viper. It’s practically poisonous.
PARABEL
You’re one to talk.
ATEN-ABEN
I won’t ask you again.
ALBA
What? Blame her. And her poisonous viper tongue.
ATEN-ABEN
One more word and I’m going to chuck your beloved king overboard. Understood?
ALBA
Mm hmm.
HOLLY
(whispers)
You got it, Alba. We’re on the case.

INT. PEARCEY’S APARTMENT
LEON
Today, 10 to 10:15am.
Stop in at florist to change order for centrepieces: fifty orange vipertongue blooms.
PEARCEY
Florist?
LEON
Apologize to them for last-minute change but make request top priority.
PEARCEY
When did even I put that in the calendar?
Loria enters, dressing for work.
LORIA
What’s up, babe?
PEARCEY
Nothing, just… another new appointment I don’t remember making.
LORIA
Spooky. Like when it told you to buy an umbrella?
PEARCEY
Yes… and I wish I had. I got drenched without one.
LORIA
So, just to be clear, you’ve got a piece of rock possessed by a dead guy…
PEARCEY
I have a Prescient Outsourced Presence who tracks my schedule.
LORIA
And fills it with random things.
PEARCEY
Only occasionally. And they’ve been very useful random things.
LORIA
Now you’re all “Trust Leon. He’s always right.”
PEARCEY
I thought you liked him.
LORIA
I’m just saying. You better not lead my Tally wrong, Mister Rock, or you’re gonna be paving a road. Got me?
LEON
I strive for reliability and accuracy.
PEARCEY
Is that everything in the calendar, Leon?
LEON
No further events. I have cleared your schedule in case of further contingencies.
PEARCEY
Good.
This gala is going to be the end of me.
LORIA
You’re gonna be fine. You got this. You always do.
PEARCEY
No swan boats.
LORIA
No swan boats! You’re gonna be amazing.
PEARCEY
Thanks, love. See you tonight.
They kiss.
LORIA
There’s a ton of paperwork coming down, so I’m probably gonna be a bit late. Save me some wine?
PEARCEY
I will.
Loria heads out. The door shuts behind her.
FADE TO:
INT. BALLROOM
Nervous chatter amongst the guests as the building flies onward.
PEARCEY
(to herself)
No swan boats. No swan boats.
(aloud)
Everyone, please calm down. Let’s not jump to any hasty conclusions.
MAGNUS
Yeah, exactly! The reason I am stuck halfway up this wall is because of a rare equilibrium between the aero-static forces and… the fabric of my robe.
PRESTON
What’s wrong with your eyes?
MAGNUS
Nothing! I am simply tired from cooking… and so I am keeping my eyes shut so that they can rest.
LADY JONEWOOD
He’s in league with the demon!
LORD JONEWOOD
Yes, yes! Out the window with him!
MAGNUS
No! Guys! Listen, I’m pretty sure I’m the only thing keeping this building from crashing to the ground.
Holly bursts back in and begins flying rapidly around the room, gathering flowers.
HOLLY
(shouting as she flies)
Everyone! I need your help.
PEARCEY
Where are the King and Queen? Are they safe?
HOLLY
They’re in the back. Alba’s with them.
PEARCEY
And the demon?
HOLLY
Yes. He’s got them in the storeroom.
Gasps and mutters.
HOLLY
But Alba figured it out! All we have to do is gather up all the flowers from the centrepieces.
PEARCEY
What?
HOLLY
They’re called vipertongues.
PEARCEY
Of course! That’s what they were for.
Yes. Everyone, please gather up the orange flowers and give them to Holly.
PRESTON
Ugh. No, get those things away from me!
(sneezes)
PEARCEY
(to Holly)
Some of our guests have been sneezing all night. So do these cause more severe reactions in demonic species?
HOLLY
Exactly! We’re going to smoke this demon out, everybody!
Which I’m feeling a little bit conflicted about. I mean, we’re healers. We’re not supposed to harm anyone, but… he is doing very bad things.
PEARCEY
I think we can safely make an exception.

Six hundred and sixty-six souls in a bag, six hundred and sixty-six souls…
You’re not singing!

ALBA
Bless you.
ATEN-ABEN
Very funny.
(sniffs, sneezes)
What’s that smell?
ALBA
(feigning innocence)
What smell?
PARABEL
I smell flowers.
(sneezes)
ATEN-ABEN
Ugh. What is going on?!
(sneezes again)
This is some sort of trick!
ALBA
It’s probably just the catering staff. They’ve been having a lot of trouble in the kitchen.
ATEN-ABEN
(shivering with cold)
Witch! What have you done to me?
ALBA
I haven’t done anything.
ATEN-ABEN
Liar.
ALBA
You took all my magic, remember?
ATEN-ABEN
Tell me what is happening!
ALBA
(with exaggerated sympathy)
Oh dear. You’re going a bit purple. Are you cold?
ATEN-ABEN
Yes!
ALBA
I’d say it looks like APF.
ATEN-ABEN
Which is?
ALBA
Acute Pyrostatic Failure. A dangerous condition for a demon. Your core temperature is plummeting.
ATEN-ABEN
(now gasping for breath)
You poisoned me.
ALBA
Did I? Have I left this room?
ATEN-ABEN
You were passing messages to your staff. All that talk about poison and tongues… It was code. This is some kind of toxin, isn’t it?
ALBA
You demons really have to be careful when you leave your home dimension. It’s freezing cold up here.
ATEN-ABEN
You’re going to pay for this.
Aten-Aben staggers forward, but Parabel suddenly pushes her way between them.
PARABEL
Oh no. You will not touch my sister.
ALBA
Parabel.
ATEN-ABEN
Out of the way, Queen.
PARABEL
Surely you wouldn’t do anything to harm the baby.
ATEN-ABEN
I could do a lot to you to without harming the baby. Besides, I intend to claim custody of the child once he’s born. And I can only do that if he’s an orphan.
PARABEL
Why, you loathsome creature.
ATEN-ABEN
It’s called How to Get Ahead in Hell. If something’s getting in your way, destroy it.
He rises and walks over to Gunther.
ATEN-ABEN
In fact, let’s start right at the top.
It’s been a good reign for old King Gunther, hasn’t it?
Another magical charge begins to build. Aten-Aben strains mightily.
PARABEL
Stop this!
ATEN-ABEN
He’s probably not gonna rate more than a page or two in the history books, but who knows? I guess that’s gonna be a question for the scholars.
PARABEL
No! Gunther!
The magic builds to a crescendo—then Alba slams a chair into Aten-Aben’s head. He staggers, and the magic dies instantly.
ATEN-ABEN
Augh! Dammit!
ALBA
I might not have magic, but luckily, we’re locked up in a storeroom full of chairs.
ATEN-ABEN
Get away from me, human!
(straining)
ALBA
Aww, is somebody short on power?
ATEN-ABEN
(panting)
Witch! I will throw you in the Dungeon of Thorns myself. A few centuries there should rid you of that smugness.
He tries another spell, but it’s weaker still. An icy crackling
ALBA
That’s another symptom of APF. Your body’s Lugosi cells are shutting down. You’re out of power too, Aten-Aben.
PARABEL
Yes, demon. How does it feel?!
Parabel picks up another chair and hits him as well. Aten-Aben groans and slumps to the floor.
ALBA
Nice swing.
PARABEL
Thank you.
Good heavens. Did we really just…
ALBA
Knock out a demon?
PARABEL
Yes.
ALBA
Yes. Good job!
They share a laugh. Then:
PARABEL
We should tip him overboard before he causes any more trouble.
ALBA
I’ll do it. Stay here. I’ll be back in a minute.
PARABEL
Alba… be careful.
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY—CONTINUOUS
The door opens, and Alba begins dragging Aten-Aben to the back door.
HOLLY
Did it work? Yes!
ALBA
Yes, it did. Thank you, Holly.
HOLLY
It wasn’t just me! Ms Pearcey ordered the flowers, and you gave me the idea to use them, and everybody else helped me gather them up.
ALBA
Help me open the back door.
HOLLY
You’re going to… oh my gosh.
ALBA
Yes I am. And we need to do it fast. If we cross into the Infernal Plane, he’s going to start regaining his strength.
HOLLY
Okay…
Together they open the door. It blows violently open. The wind howls outside.
HOLLY
Oh gosh!
ALBA
Be careful, Holly!
Alba strains to shove the demon out without being pulled out herself.
ATEN-ABEN
(weakly)
It won’t do you any good, you know.
ALBA
What won’t?
ATEN-ABEN
This building is still on course. Even without me, it’s going to fly all the way to the Pits of Qwaytox.
(laughs)
Sorry, Alba. Your sister’s boy is still going to be born in Hell.
ALBA
Maybe. But at least he won’t be raised by you.
She shoves. Aten-Aben screams as he falls.
Then, nothing but the howling wind.
HOLLY
Are you all right, Alba?
ALBA
Better.
I’m going to look after Parabel. Can you head back to the ballroom and tell our guests what’s happening?
HOLLY
Not yet. I’ve got a job to do.
ALBA
What job? Where are you going?
HOLLY
I’m going to turn this carriage house around.
ALBA
You’re what? Holly, no!
Holly launches herself out the door.
She strains and beats the air with her wings.
ALBA
Holly!
HOLLY
It’s okay, Alba. I’ve got this.
She screams fiercely as the storm swirls around her.
CUT TO:
INT. BALLROOM
The walls groan and crack. The chandelier smashes to the ground. Guests scream.
PEARCEY

Magnus, what’s happening?
MAGNUS
I don’t know! You guys, it’s like something’s trying to push us off course.
Aaaaa—!
SHOCK CUT TO:
EXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE
HOLLY
Come on! You can’t—fight—the Queen of the Wind!
The boards she’s hanging onto crack and fall away. Holly careens off into the night sky, screaming.
FADE OUT.
INT. BALLROOM
The carriage house is still in flight, but no longer being buffeted by turbulence.
MAGNUS
So, how’s it looking, boss?
ALBA
It’s definitely some kind of Qwaytoxian magic. Your body is being pulled toward… our destination, whatever that is. If I had my magic, I might be able to dispel it.
MAGNUS
Yeah. Demons kinda suck, you know?
For a minute there, it was like something was fighting me, trying to push us back. It was like we flew into a hurricane.
ALBA
Yes.
MAGNUS
And then it just stopped.
ALBA
Yes.
MAGNUS
Was that Holly?
ALBA
It was.
MAGNUS
Aw… dammit.
I hope she’s okay. I mean, she’s a crazy fairy who eats too many weird mushrooms, but she’s just a better… everything than me, you know?
ALBA
I know.
MAGNUS
That’s where you’re supposed to say, “No, no, you’re brilliant, Magnus.”
ALBA
(chuckles softly)
You’re getting there.
You always had great potential.
MAGNUS
(snickers)
So much for that, eh?
The sky’s starting to get red.
ALBA
Yes. We’re getting near the convergence.
MAGNUS
Oh boy. They basically eat humans, don’t they?
ALBA
It’s not going to be a warm welcome.
MAGNUS
Aw, man.
The door opens.
HOLLY
(out of breath)
I made it. Is everybody okay?
ALBA AND MAGNUS
Holly!
HOLLY
I’m sorry. I couldn’t turn the building around. The demon magic is too strong. I’m sorry, Alba.
ALBA
You did what you could.
MAGNUS
So… I got a question for you, Holly.
HOLLY
What.
MAGNUS
Listen. Do you think, if the building wasn’t flying… do you think you could carry it? Or bring it down safe, at least?
HOLLY
You mean…
MAGNUS
Like… if I wasn’t here.
ALBA
Magnus.
HOLLY
I think I could probably land the building, but…
MAGNUS
Okay. Good.
HOLLY
But what about you, though? Where are you going?
MAGNUS
Well, see, this beam I’m stuck to? The bricks around it are starting to fall apart. A couple good kicks and it’ll probably come loose.
ALBA
That makes sense. It would have been easier for Aten-Aben to attach you to a beam than a whole building made of different materials.
HOLLY
But… but then you’ll be flying off to Hell. By yourself.
MAGNUS
Better than all of us.
ALBA
I’ll grant you that.
HOLLY
Magnus, you can’t!
MAGNUS
Hey, we gotta do something. I figure it’s gonna get pretty hot in here soon.
HOLLY
It’s going to be so quiet around the House of Healing, you know…
MAGNUS
Aw, you guys will be too busy to notice. And hey, you got Minister Pearcey now. She’s a laugh a minute.
HOLLY
Because I know we fight and get on each other’s nerves a lot, but now and then…
MAGNUS
Yeah. We do okay. We do good in the world. The team that heals together, right?
HOLLY
Right.
Silence.
MAGNUS
So, Alba. Go ahead, say it.
ALBA
Say what?
MAGNUS
“Go to hell, Magnus.”
ALBA
(laughs)
You’re a better person than I was at your age.
MAGNUS
Whoa! Was that praise? I’m not dreaming, am I?
ALBA
All right. There’s not much time left.
MAGNUS
(deep breaths)
Okay. Okay. I… I can do this. I’m gonna—
Holly seizes him in a hug.
MAGNUS
Holly! Geez!
HOLLY
I’m not crying. You’re crying, like a… like a dumb human boy.
MAGNUS
Yeah, that’s me.
ALBA
Take care of yourself down there. We’ll find a way to get you back.
MAGNUS
I’ll be fine. I’m always good. I mean hey, I’ve fought with bandits, and dragons… and I got trapped in Limbo once by an angry goddess, and I managed to get out of there! Hell is gonna be a piece of cake.
ALBA
…Limbo?
MAGNUS
Yeah. Long story. Tell you later.
(to the room)
Okay. Everybody hold on tight! We’re gonna try a thing here.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE NIGHT SKY
Over the wind, we hear a cracking, crunching sound as bricks give way.
MAGNUS
Oh gods!
Another crunch. Broken bricks tumble away.
MAGNUS
Oh geez!
With a twisting, wrenching sound, the beam tears loose and soars past us at an unbelievable speed, carrying a screaming Magnus with it into the distance.
At the same time, the wind begins to whip up into a tornado. We close in on Holly, groaning with effort as she beats her wings furiously.
Finally, there’s a cracking, crashing noise as the carriage house hits the ground.
FADE OUT.
INT. BALLROOM
Gasps and groans.
HOLLY
(nearly fainting from exhaustion)
Did it work? Did we stop in time?
ALBA
It worked. I don’t think we crossed over.
HOLLY
Yay.
Is the Queen all right?
ALBA
Let’s hope so.
PEARCEY
Everyone. We should make our way outside.
ALBA
Oh dear, that’s a nasty cut.
PEARCEY
If you are able, please help out anyone nearby who needs it. And watch out for debris.
ALBA
Keep the pressure on it. I’ll come back around.
Outside, morning birds chirp.
LORD JONEWOOD
I say, is this Hell?
LADY JONEWOOD
I don’t think they have birds in Hell, dearest.
LORD JONEWOOD
Oh, I didn’t realize you’d been.
LADY JONEWOOD
I haven’t!
Not yet.
GUNTHER
My fellow Farlorians, I have good news.
Queen Parabel and her new baby are alive and well.
A cheer goes up.
GUNTHER
I’m afraid we don’t have a name yet. He arrived a little earlier than planned, but he’s certainly a good size.
From inside comes a clap of thunder and the sound of the baby giggling.
PARABEL
(from inside)
Now, stop that!
GUNTHER
And quite… vigorous.
It’s probably safest if nobody goes back there.
PEARCEY
(near exhaustion)
Mister Preston, can you please check the guest list and see who’s unaccounted for? Is the way to the kitchen safe? Hopefully some food survived the trip.
ALBA
Minister, you’ve been on your feet all night. Get some rest.
PEARCEY
But things need to be organized. And we’ll have to find some way to get a message back to Grandville, too…
Oh, goodness. Loria.
ALBA
Antalia Pearcey, have a seat. Doctor’s orders.
PEARCEY
Yes, Alba. Perhaps I’ll just… lie down for a minute.
What about you?
ALBA
Never mind me.
She begins to circulate among the guests outside.
ALBA
Lady Crannion… oh no, that’s broken, isn’t it. Hold it steady—sir, could you look for some cloth and something to use for a splint? I’m going to go and check on Her Majesty and her little one.
Another giggle. More thunder.
ALBA
Wish me luck.
GUNTHER
Well then! I suppose the next question is… does anyone know where we are?

TAG: HOLLY DEPARTS
Birds chirp in the background.
ALBA
I just wish there was more I could do.
HOLLY
Alba. You’re doing so much already.
ALBA
I know.
HOLLY
You just work on getting your magic back. Magnus and I will be back before you know it. I’m sure I’ll meet some helpful people along the way!
ALBA
In Hell.
HOLLY
There are nice people everywhere if you look hard enough.
ALBA
Good luck, Holly.
HOLLY
You too. I hope you find your sister!
ALBA
(chuckles)
Oh, don’t remind me.
HOLLY
Bye Alba.
Music swells as she takes to the air.
HOLLY
I’m on my way, Magnus!"
