"S1 E1: Well Met","INT. PALACE CHAMBERS, MORNING
PARABEL
Good morning, Millie.
MILLIE
Good morning to you, Your Majesty. Tea?
PARABEL
Yes, please.
MILLIE
Beautiful day out today.
PARABEL
The girls are off to their riding lessons?
MILLIE
Yes… though it took a bit of doing. Willemina is still unhappy they don’t have unicorns.
PARABEL
Well, Mummy and Daddy can’t afford unicorns this year. Where is Gunther, anyway?
MILLIE
His Majesty’s still in bed, I think.
SOUND: Wooden door opens
SOUND: Soft hissing
GUNTHER
(emerging, sleepy)
No, I’m awake.
(yawns)
Or almost awake. I swear, it must be something in that tonic Alba gave me for my…
SOUND: Tea service crashes to the floor
MILLIE
(horrified)
Oh, my word! Your Majesty!
PARABEL
Millie… oh, do take better care. Look what you’ve—
(screams)
Gunther!
GUNTHER
What? Parabel, what’s the matter?
PARABEL
Your hair! It’s all snakes! Look in the mirror!
SOUND: Snakelike hissing grows louder and louder
GUNTHER
Oh, for heaven’s sake. Get Alba in here!
MUSIC: OPENING THEME
HERALD
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the First: Well Met.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
SOUND: Quiet bubbling, stirring
SOUND: Book page being turned
ALBA
(mumbling)
Grind and add seven leaves dried catnip. Is that per dose, or the whole cauldron?
SOUND: Door opens
JEROME
Alba!
ALBA
Hi Jerome.
JEROME
I wonder if you could help me out.
ALBA
(barely paying attention)
I’m a bit busy this afternoon…
JEROME
Oh, I understand. This won’t take long… I’ve just been having a touch of the old rheumatism again.
ALBA
(sighs)
Mm hmm.
JEROME
I was wondering, since you’re so good with potions and all, if you could mix up something.
ALBA
I’ve got three prescriptions to fill right now, Jerome.
JEROME
Not to worry, I can wait.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Hooves clop in, then desk bell rings
ALBA
Excuse me a moment.
(to new patient)
Yes, can I help you?
VALTAR
Yes, I needs must see someone about my back.
ALBA
You’re in luck… our visiting chiropractor, Balthig the Ogre is in today. Have you seen him before?
VALTAR
No, I have not.
SOUND: Clipboard
ALBA
All right. You’ll need to fill out this patient information form.
VALTAR
(moving off)
Certainly.
SOUND: Hooves clop
JEROME
Boy, a centaur. Don’t get many of them around, eh?
ALBA
(distracted)
No, we don’t.
JEROME
So, you coming to the Palace tonight?
ALBA
The Palace?
JEROME
To see the show. The Dragon Mountain Monks are in town to perform astonishing feats of acrobatics and martial arts!
ALBA
Nah, not interested. I really don’t need to see a bunch of bald weirdos jumping around and chopping firewood with their hands.
JEROME
But Alba! They’re doing the Great Sword Dance. The Monks only perform it publicly every eight years.
ALBA
Yes. Very exciting. Seen it.
SOUND: Hooves approach
VALTAR
(wandering up)
Hold on, what’s this about a consultation fee?
ALBA
I’m afraid chiropractic isn’t covered for centaurs.
VALTAR
How is that fair?
ALBA
You’ve got twice the vertebrae and two ribcages.
VALTAR
It’s discrimination!
ALBA
I don’t set the prices. Take it up with Balthig. He’s right through there.
VALTAR
(wandering away again)
I believe I will.
SOUND: Hooves recede, interior door opens and shuts
ALBA
Where was I… one pennyweight of powdered parchment leaf. Bring to a boil…
SOUND: Stirring
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
KID
(running in)
Albaaa! I have the hic hiccups!
ALBA
Do you really.
KID
They’re terrible awful. How do I hic make them stop?
ALBA
That’s easy. Just stand on one foot…
KID
Uh huh…
ALBA
No, the left one. That’s it. Now, give me your hand, and put out your pinky finger…
KID
Like hic that?
ALBA
Just like that. Good. Now, hand me that big pair of shears.
KID
These she—hic—shears?
SOUND: Slight clatter of shears, and the soft noise of the blades opening
ALBA
Hold still now… keep that finger out nice and straight…
KID
No, wait wait wait!
ALBA
What is it?
KID
They’re gone! The hiccups! They’re all gone!
ALBA
Are they? Well, that’s a relief. I guess you get to keep your finger then.
KID
Whew!
ALBA
But if you ever have bad hiccups again, you just come and talk to me. Okay?
KID
O—hic—okay.
ALBA
You sure they’re gone?
KID
Totally gone! Um, th-thanks Alba!
ALBA
Don’t mention it.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Distant crunch
VALTAR
(from the other room)
Aaaaa!
BALTHIG
(from the other room)
Now other side, please.
JEROME
Supposed to rain again tomorrow, I heard.
ALBA
Are you still here?
JEROME
And the day after that. I dunno how they tell. D’you know how they tell? Being a witch and all?
ALBA
Jerome. I’m supposed to cure the ills of an entire kingdom here, and you are wasting my time.
JEROME
Oh. Well… so, about my rheumatism…
ALBA
Yes. Yes, you’re right. Sorry. Here. Take this. Drink a mouthful with every meal. Don’t bug me any more.
JEROME
Oh! Well, thank you kindly then.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
HERALD
(entering)
Miss Alba Salix.
ALBA
(ready to snap)
Yes.
HERALD
His Majesty the King requests your presence at the Palace.
ALBA
Oh?
HERALD
‘Tis a matter of some secrecy, he says, and most urgent.
ALBA
Now what?
(sighs, then, leaving)
Tell him I’m on my way.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Crunch
VALTAR
Aaaaaa!
SOUND: Interior door opens
SOUND: Hooves, unsteady
BALTHIG
All done.
VALTAR
(winded)
Yes, thank you, that’s much better.
BALTHIG
You pay now.
VALTAR
Yes, yes of course… Very, uh, very reasonable rates indeed.
SOUND: Largish bag of coins handed over
BALTHIG
Remember stretching. Take care bye bye.
INT. PALACE
HERALD
Miss Alba Salix to see you, Majesty.
GUNTHER
Show her in. Hello, Alba.
SOUND: Door closes
ALBA
Hi Gunther… did you try out that hair tonic I gave you?
GUNTHER
Yes, about that.
ALBA
What’s the towel for?
(proudly)
Washing your new head of hair, were you?
GUNTHER
Look.
SOUND: Hissing and slithering
GUNTHER
Notice anything different?
ALBA
Oh, um… well, yes, you have a lovely full head of, um…
GUNTHER
Snakes.
ALBA
That’s the word I was looking for. How did this happen?
GUNTHER
Clearly a result of your little tonic.
ALBA
Clearly not! There’s no way it could have caused anything like this.
GUNTHER
Alba, what am I supposed to do now?
ALBA
Well, the… uh, serpentine look is very in this year. Gorgon chic, they’re calling it.
GUNTHER
I will not live with snakes on my head. What if one of them bites me?
ALBA
Oh, they’re only garter snakes. They’re quite harmless.
GUNTHER
Parabel won’t come near me. I can’t go out in public like this! And I was looking forward to the Dragon Mountain Monks show this evening, too.
ALBA
Yes. Sorry, Your Majesty. I’ll see what I can do.
GUNTHER
And what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
ALBA
I’d keep the towel on. Snakes like the warmth.
EXT. PALACE GROUNDS
MUSIC: Lute and cymbals, distant
SOUND: Rhythmically rustling robes, dozens of bare feet stamping
MONKS
(in the distance, synchronized)
Hyaaaaa—foo! Hah!
LAING
Good work, brothers. Let us take fifteen before we rehearse the second half.
MONK
Yes, Father.
MAGNUS
Father Laing! Can I show you my moves now?
LAING
Not now, Brother Magnus.
MAGNUS
But you promised to let me show you. I’ve been working hard!
LAING
Magnus…
MAGNUS
Please. I want to be a warrior-monk.
LAING
You are young still, and have not the proper energy and attitude to pursue the art of combat.
MAGNUS
But I wanna learn to kick through walls and kill people with just my eyelids. Why the hell else would I join your stupid order?
SOUND: Smack
MAGNUS
Ow! I mean why the heck.
LAING
You only prove my point.
MAGNUS
Okay, sorry, I renounce all worldly things and I promise to use my powers for good and I don’t have an ego and stuff. Can I be a warrior monk now?
LAING
Magnus, your skills lie in other areas. You have it in you to be an excellent healer.
MAGNUS
Stupid healing. Can’t you teach me, like, one secret pressure point? Like that one that makes your ribcage explode?
SOUND: Big door creaks, distant, and booted footsteps
LAING
Hush, boy.
(calling)
Miss Salix? Excuse me, are you Miss Alba Salix?
ALBA
(approaching)
That’s me.
LAING
A pleasure. I am Father Laing of the Order of Dragon Mountain.
ALBA
Nice to meet you. Look, is this going to take long? I’ve got an important matter to attend to on behalf of His Majesty—
LAING
I understand you are the head of the new House of Healing, and as such I wonder if you might have a place for a young man who shows great potential as a surgeon.
ALBA
A surgeon?
LAING
Yes. Permit me to introduce Brother Magnus.
MAGNUS
Are you a witch?
LAING
Magnus! This is Miss Alba Salix, the Royal Physician.
MAGNUS
A woman physician? You gotta be kidding.
ALBA
An apprentice? This kid?
MAGNUS
I’m seventeen. And I know martial arts.
ALBA
I can’t say he sounds of much use to anyone, let alone me.
LAING
He does have some skill, and he’s… got great potential.
ALBA
I don’t need any assistance.
MAGNUS
You heard the witch.
ALBA
I certainly don’t need him. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some herbs to gather.
INT. PALACE
SOUND: Muffled hissing throughout
PARABEL
Gunther?
GUNTHER
Yes, Parabel.
PARABEL
Did Alba get rid of the snakes?
GUNTHER
She’s working on it. Though I may as well give in and get Krankel in here to have a look.
PARABEL
You said you weren’t going to ask him.
GUNTHER
Well, what choice do I have?
PARABEL
Well… maybe I can help?
GUNTHER
(skeptical)
What do you propose to do, dear?
PARABEL
Well, you know how I have mystical powers too…
GUNTHER
Yes…
PARABEL
I am Alba’s sister, remember.
GUNTHER
And do you know any snake-removal spells?
PARABEL
Well, not spells… I haven’t studied the way Alba has, of course, but if I concentrate, and picture you in my mind without the snakes…
GUNTHER
Yes?
PARABEL
(nervously)
And then, um… if I kiss you…
GUNTHER
You’ll have to come a bit closer for that, dear.
PARABEL
Uh huh!
(braces herself, then kisses him)
…Anything?
GUNTHER
Not yet.
PARABEL
(disappointed)
Kissing always works.
GUNTHER
Perhaps if you were to kiss each snake individually?
PARABEL
(squeamish)
Nnnghh…
GUNTHER
Go ahead.
SOUND: Towel unwrapped, louder hissing
PARABEL
All right, here we go. Nghh…!
(tries mightily… then gives in)
Okay, you’d better summon Krankel.
EXP. MEADOW—DAY
SOUND: Birdsongs and other forest noises. Humming wings, like a dragonfly’s, zoom all about, and so does the voice of…
HOLLY
(singing)
Good morning, meadow, good day! You’re the loveliest meadow of all, I dare say…
(fading into the distance)
Hello, Mister Hedgehog! Hello, Bumblebees! Hello, daisies and blackbirds and sycamore trees…
SOUND: Footsteps through underbrush
ALBA
(approaching, from the other direction)
Snakeweed. Why can’t I find any snakeweed?
HOLLY
(approaching at top speed, still singing)
Swallowtail butterflies, grasshoppers too…
SOUND: Holly zooms in; thump of impact and crashing of bushes, clattering of bottles
ALBA
Augh!
HOLLY
Ooof!
(picking herself up)
Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t see you there.
ALBA
(winded)
Why don’t you watch where you’re flying?!
HOLLY
Here, let me help you with your basket… My name’s Holly, by the way.
ALBA
Bloody fairies! I can manage my basket just fine.
HOLLY
Oh, chokecherries. Are you making a liver tonic?
ALBA
No.
HOLLY
A poultice?
ALBA
No.
HOLLY
A charm against thieves?
ALBA
No, it’s for removing snakes from someone’s—who the hell are you, anyway?
HOLLY
Snakes? Ohh! Chokecherry doesn’t remove snakes, that’s just an old wives’ tale. Sorry! Didn’t mean it like that—being that you are, you know… um…
ALBA
An old wife?
HOLLY
I didn’t mean it like that…
ALBA
I’m neither, thank you very much. Now excuse me.
SOUND: Footsteps, followed a few seconds later by humming wings
HOLLY
You know what’s better for removing snakes, is silverbark.
ALBA
Did I ask?
HOLLY
(miffed)
It seemed like the best way to help you out. You know, to make amends for bumping into you and calling you an old wife—
ALBA
That’s very kind. I don’t need your help.
HOLLY
(flying away)
Fine!
(catches herself, and returns)
But really, you should try the silverbark. There’s a stand of it right over there.
ALBA
All the books I’ve ever read say chokecherry.
HOLLY
Who are you going to believe? A bunch of books, or an expert herbalist?
ALBA
Expert? You? You can’t even fly straight.
HOLLY
Well, that’s probably just the rainbow-cap angel mushrooms I was trying earlier. Seems like they mess with my sense of direction. I should make a note of that…
ALBA
Uh huh.
HOLLY
It’s my big research project, see. I’ve been working my way through the native fungi of Farlora, to find out their effects on fairy physiology.
ALBA
And suddenly all is explained.
HOLLY
Can’t I at least carry your basket or something?
ALBA
No thank you.
SOUND: Wings
HOLLY
Please? I need to do you a good deed to set things right. It’s what we fairies do. Here, let me. Let me!
ALBA
No! Let go, you. Don’t make me smack you!
HOLLY
It’s really nothing! I can always—
SOUND: Crack of wicker, crashing and clinking
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Oops.
(flying away)
Sorry sorry sorry!
SOUND: Wings receding
ALBA
Bloody fairies!
INT. PALACE
HERALD
The Sorceror General to see you, Majesty.
GUNTHER
Krankel.
KRANKEL
Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
Do you know anything about snakes? Removing them, I mean?
KRANKEL
Are they getting into the palace gardens again?
GUNTHER
No. They’re on my head.
SOUND: Towel, hissing snakes
KRANKEL
Oh dear. And how did this come about? Let me guess—was it perhaps that “physician” of yours?
GUNTHER
It was supposed to be a hair tonic…
KRANKEL
Oh dear me. How terrible.
GUNTHER
Is there anything you can do?
KRANKEL
Mmm. It’s a tricky business, this. Do you have any more of the tonic, so-called?
GUNTHER
Alba took the rest of the bottle.
KRANKEL
Hmm. Without being able to perform an analysis on this preparation, I will require more time to formulate a suitable remedy.
GUNTHER
I hope you’re enjoying yourself, Krankel.
KRANKEL
Not at all, Majesty. But I did warn you, if I recall.
GUNTHER
Yes, yes. Stop poking at my snakes.
KRANKEL
With respect, Majesty, it is a consequence of allowing, if I may be so bold, a self-taught hedge witch to minister to the health of yourself and the kingdom at large…
GUNTHER
Thank you, Mister Krankel.
KRANKEL
Doctor Kra—
GUNTHER
Doctor Krankel. Just look for a remedy, please.
KRANKEL
(leaving)
Of course, Majesty.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
SOUND: Bubbling and fizzing, spoon stirring metal pot
ALBA
…Two parts tincture of rosehip to three parts dragon scale oil. Reduce heat and add three leaves of cow parsnip… drat.
SOUND: Spoon set down
SOUND: Door creaks open
ALBA
You!
HOLLY
I have wronged you, Miss Alba Salix, and now I must—
ALBA
What are you doing in my pantry?
HOLLY
I must do three good deeds for you to set things right. Look! I brought you a new basket.
ALBA
How did you get in?
HOLLY
Um… through the window.
ALBA
Oh gods…
HOLLY
Yeah, sorry about that, by the way.
ALBA
You broke my window!
HOLLY
I know! I’m sorry! I’ll fix it. Okay, so that’s four good deeds. But look, I’ve been sorting your pantry. Look!
ALBA
You’ve been… Oh, great Ivar, what have you done? I had everything filed away…
HOLLY
It was a crazy jumble! I don’t know how you could ever find anything.
ALBA
There’s a system! I had a system. And now I’ve got about two minutes to come up with a potion for the King!
(sighs)
Cow parsnip… cow parsnip… look at this! They’re not even in alphabetical order.
HOLLY
No, see! Alphabetical doesn’t make sense. I mean, if you’re looking for cow parsnip, is that under C for cow or P for parsnip or H for Heracleum? (hare-a-CLEE-um)
ALBA
You tell me.
HOLLY
I’ve organized them all by their Glade-Miles Herbal Catalogue Number.
ALBA
Oh gods help me.
HOLLY
This is the eight hundreds, which is everything with a hollow stem… here’s your hemlock, fennel, parsley and look… cow parsnip! You want the greens or the flowers?
ALBA
Give me that!
HOLLY
You’re welcome!
ALBA
And put my shelves back the way they were.
HOLLY
But I have to do a good deed so that we can—
ALBA
Here’s your good deed. Put everything back, and then get out of my pantry.
HOLLY
Geez, okay, okay.
ALBA
If there’s one thing I don’t need, it’s more “help”.
SOUND: Door opens
GUNTHER
(entering)
Alba, for heaven’s sake, I’ve got half an hour before I have to be back at the palace for the Monks’ show!
ALBA
There you are, Gunther! I was just, ah, finishing up the mixture… Here, get that towel off. Drink this.
SOUND: Towel removed, hissing of snakes
GUNTHER
Thank heavens.
(drinks)
Ugh. How long will it take?
ALBA
It should be instantaneous.
SOUND: Continued hissing
GUNTHER
Is there a particular instant you had in mind?
ALBA
Just give it a minute.
GUNTHER
I don’t feel anything.
HOLLY
(entering)
Hey, Alba, what should I do with this pumpkin extract? Oh, hey! You look kind of like the King except with snakes on your head!
GUNTHER
I am the King!
HOLLY
Oh! Well, in that case, hail, good King… uh…
ALBA
Gunther.
HOLLY
Gunther. King Gunther. I like the snakes!
GUNTHER
I don’t!
ALBA
(mutters)
Damn, they’re not shifting…
HOLLY
(quietly)
I told you, silverbark…
ALBA
Well, I don’t have any!
HOLLY
Not to worry. I brought some from the meadow.
SOUND: Rustling leaves, then chopping and clinking
HOLLY
Look—just grind it up finely, squeeze out the juice into one cup pear cider vinegar…
GUNTHER
Who is this person?
ALBA
Her name’s Holly. She’s… she’s an expert herbalist.
(mutters)
So she claims.
SOUND: Stirring, fizzing
HOLLY
A dash of nutmeg… and here you go.
GUNTHER
(drinking)
Mm, actually not too bad. Oh my word! It’s working.
SOUND: Hissing and slithering, receding
HOLLY
Here, bend down quick.
ALBA
No, no, use the basket! Take them outside.
HOLLY
See? It’s the oils in the silverbark. They help the snakes’ tails grow out and detach from your head.
GUNTHER
Dear me. I’ve never been so glad to be bald.
HOLLY
Bye, little snakes!
ALBA
Great. They’re all going under the furniture…
GUNTHER
That’s the last of them. Thank heavens. I must get back to the Palace. Thank you—Holly, was it?
HOLLY
Any time, your Majesty!
GUNTHER
Alba, I do hope you’re keeping her on.
ALBA
(under her breath)
No. I’m holding out for someone even more annoying.
SOUND: Door closes
HOLLY
What did I tell you?
ALBA
It was the chokecherry. A delayed reaction.
HOLLY
Was that a good deed or what?
ALBA
And now I have three dozen snakes living in my office.
HOLLY
Oh. Right. I can help with that. Hey… if they sprang from the King’s head, does that make them all princes and princesses?
ALBA
I don’t care. Chuck ’em out.
HOLLY
(to a snake)
Hi cutie. I’m gonna call you Princess Coily… and you, you look like a Tyrone…
ALBA
Holly. The basket.
HOLLY
Yes Ma’am!
INT. PALACE GROUNDS—STAGE TENT
WALLA: Excited anticipation
MUSIC: Monkish accompaniment, dramatic
HERALD
Your Royal Majesties! Ladies and Gentlemen. We proudly present, from the far Western Reaches, the warrior monks of the Order of Dragon Mountain!
WALLA: Applause
SOUND: Pounding footfalls and monks shouting
GUNTHER
Impressive, aren’t they?
PARABEL
Mmm, I like that one.
GUNTHER
Parabel!
PARABEL
You had your belly dancers last week.
GUNTHER
You insisted they wear robes. Look, what do you call that?
PARABEL
It’s traditional garb.
GUNTHER
It looks drafty.
PARABEL
That’s rich, coming from Mister “Ooo, the Sultan of Svangililand Has a Harem, Why Can’t I?”
GUNTHER
I didn’t say that.
PARABEL
Oh yes you did.
GUNTHER
Well, I didn’t say it like that.
KRANKEL
Your Majesties.
GUNTHER
Krankel! What are you doing here?
KRANKEL
I have found a remedy for the snakes that have been plaguing your royal scalp… er… your snakes—what’s happened to them?
GUNTHER
Alba took care of them.
KRANKEL
Did she?
GUNTHER
Well, she and her fairy.
KRANKEL
Which fairy would this be?
PARABEL
If you please, Mister Krankel…
KRANKEL
Doctor Krankel.
PARABEL
…the show is about to start and you’re being most distracting.
GUNTHER
Indeed.
KRANKEL
Yes, my apologies, Majesties. A good evening to you both.
(to himself)
A fairy, eh? Hmmm.
SOUND: Monks finale
WALLA: Applause
LAING
Your Majesties. We humbly offer you: the Golden Sunflower Head Slice Technique, demonstrated by Brother Coe and Brother Fang.
WALLA: Applause.
SOUND: Clashing swords and shouts
PARABEL
Ooh, that looks dangerous.
GUNTHER
Nonsense… all those swords are blunted so no one gets hurt.
SOUND: Swish, chop and a clattering of lumber
WALLA: Gasps and applause
GUNTHER
On the other hand…
MONKS
Hyah!
SOUND: Running footsteps, frantically whooshing sword blade
MAGNUS
(approaching)
Haaaaaaaaa! Hah!
(continues under)
WALLA: Laughter and excited chatter
PARABEL
Who on earth is that?
GUNTHER
That boy’s going to take someone’s head off.
LAING
(furtively, to Magnus)
Brother Magnus, what are you doing?
(aloud)
Your Majesties, I apologize! This is not part of the…
(to Magnus)
Get off the stage!
SOUND: Sword swinging
MAGNUS
Yaaah! Look, Father Laing! The Spiral pose! Torch bearer pose! Harvesting the grain! Tiger claw!
PARABEL
Shouldn’t we call the guards in?
GUNTHER
The monks should be able to handle it. He’s one of theirs, after all… and not a very good one.
LAING
Magnus! Not around the tent poles.
MAGNUS
Hurricane blade! Cannon kick! Hah!
LAING
Magnus! Come away from that pole!
SOUND: Crack of wood
MAGNUS
(falling)
Whoa, woah, whoa!
SOUND: Crash and thump
WALLA: Gasps and groans, a few laughs and cheers, then screams of panic
PARABEL
Oh dear!
GUNTHER
Idiot’s gone and gutted himself.
PARABEL
Oh dear, there’s blood everywhere…
MAGNUS
(weakly)
Ow! Dammit! I mean… cursèd… I mean… doggone drat in a hat…
SOUND: Wooden beams creak and then cave in
WALLA: Gasps
LAING
Magnus!
MAGNUS
Augh!
MONK
(running over)
Brothers! Father Laing! Are you all right?
LAING
Find the right place to stand, and the violence and troubles of the world shall pass you by.
MAGNUS
(muffled)
I’m fine too!
LAING
Your Majesties, Ladies and Gentlemen, there will be, um, a short break in the performance.
(to Magnus)
You idiot.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
HOLLY
I’m telling you, it makes perfect sense! It’s all in the book.
ALBA
It would help if either of us had this book.
HOLLY
What’s next?
ALBA
(wearily)
Purple coneflower?
HOLLY
That’s in the nine hundreds. No, wait… rats, it should be right here between sunflower and ragweed…
ALBA
Never mind. I’ll just get some from the garden.
HOLLY
I know it’s here somewhere…
ALBA
Thank you for your help.
HOLLY
I can sweep the rooms too. Organize your office?
ALBA
(firmly)
No.
HOLLY
But I haven’t made amends properly yet.
ALBA
We’ll call it even.
HOLLY
No, no, that’s not how it works! Upon my honour as a good fairy, I have solemnly…
SOUND: Door opens and monks enter
LAING
(entering)
Set him down there.
SOUND: Magnus set down with a bump
MAGNUS
Oof.
LAING
Oh, uh, Miss Salix!
ALBA
Yes? What’s happened?
LAING
A boy has been injured.
ALBA
Oh, dear. One of yours?
MAGNUS
(weakly)
Hey, Doc.
ALBA
Ah, it’s you.
LAING
He ran out during the performance, fell on his sword and brought the stage tent down on himself.
ALBA
Least he could have done is finish the job.
(sighs, then calls)
Holly!
HOLLY
(entering)
What can I do?
ALBA
I need fresh bloodwort. Lots of it.
HOLLY
(running off)
Coming up!
LAING
Miss Salix, I would entrust young Magnus to your care.
ALBA
What for? I’ll bandage him up and you can be on your merry way tomorrow.
LAING
Well, he is badly hurt, and we are, um, leaving town early.
ALBA
Ah. King didn’t appreciate the impromptu renovations, huh?
LAING
He was tough but fair.
HOLLY
(hurrying in)
Here’s the bloodwort.
(gasps)
Oh, geez, the poor kid!
MAGNUS
‘M seventeen…
HOLLY
We gotta clean up that gash and close it up.
MAGNUS
They let women and fairies work as physicians here?
LAING
Shut up, boy.
MAGNUS
What kind of a place is this?
HOLLY
Hey!
ALBA
Magnus? Hold still, this might hurt.
SOUND: Swat
MAGNUS
Ow! You’re supposed to be healing me!
ALBA
I know. Women, eh?
HOLLY
Oh juniper that’s a lot of blood.
MAGNUS
Eee, ee, ow… dammit to… golly gee darnit that stings.
HOLLY
Sorry, I gotta staunch the wound.
LAING
As well, I was hoping that you might give more thought to taking on young Magnus as an apprentice.
ALBA
Are you serious? Look at the damage he’s done in one night.
LAING
(lowering his voice)
I think of it this way… he is young, and hot-tempered, he has great interest in seeking the powers of dark magic. Something that I understand you yourself have experience in.
ALBA
(hushed)
Who told you that?
LAING
Magnus needs a guiding hand such as yours to set him on the right course.
ALBA
You want me to teach him dark magic?
LAING
No. I mean that you have made the journey into the darkest places of the soul and come back to the light.
ALBA
Not interested. I’ll fix the kid up, sure, but his karma is your problem.
LAING
Miss Salix. I hope you’ll reconsider.
HOLLY
Alba, you’re gonna have to bandage this one up, I’m feeling all woozy.
ALBA
Great.
SOUND: Drawer opened, rattle of instruments
MAGNUS
Don’t you have Threadstrong brand sutures?
ALBA
Stitch in Time are far better.
MAGNUS
Not on a wound this deep.
ALBA
These are the D series sutures. They’re double-enchanted to prevent infection and promote healing.
MAGNUS
I’m telling you, Threadstrong is the way to go.
SOUND: Rummaging in drawer
ALBA
You want Threadstrong? Fine. But don’t blame me when you come down with drill worms. And they always leave a scar.
MAGNUS
Excellent. Ow, ow.
ALBA
Hold still.
MAGNUS
Ow! Who did you sleep with to get this job? Or are you bestest friends with the Queen or something?
ALBA
Her sister, actually.
MAGNUS
Oh, that explains it.
(pause, then with growing glee)
Wait a second. You’re the Queen’s sister?
ALBA
Quick on the uptake.
MAGNUS
That means it was you… You tried to marry the King! Isn’t that how it happened? Three sisters tried to save the King’s life, and the youngest actually cured him and married him.
ALBA
There are a lot of different stories out there.
MAGNUS
So does that mean you failed? Or did the King just think she was prettier than you? Heh. OW!
ALBA
You should lay still and not talk when I’m trying to stitch you up.
MAGNUS
What, ’cause I might hit a nerve?
(proudly)
Oh yeah.
(pause)
Hey, is that what he meant about how you’ve been to dark places of the soul?
ALBA
Who said that?
MAGNUS
Father Laing. He said you know dark magic.
ALBA
He was only trying to get me to take you in.
MAGNUS
I bet you do. Show me a trick. Show me. Disintegrate something!
ALBA
No.
MAGNUS
Please?
ALBA
Give it up. Laing, tell your young monk here that I don’t do dark magic.
(nothing)
Father Laing?
MAGNUS
He snuck out.
ALBA
Bloody monks!
MAGNUS
I know, eh?
(pause)
Alba?
ALBA
Yes, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Are you evil?
ALBA
You don’t want to know.
MAGNUS
Yeah I do.
ALBA
No, you really don’t.
MAGNUS
C’mon, you can tell me all about your sins. I’m a holy man. Hey, where are you going? You haven’t done my leg yet. I’m still bleeding.
ALBA
(leaving)
Good. Keep it up.
MAGNUS
Ha ha, funny.
(pause)
Alba?
INT. PANTRY, CONTINUOUS
HOLLY
Hey, Alba. Get you anything?
ALBA
No, I’m fine.
HOLLY
Sorry about ducking out… whew! All that blood. I had to make some tea and calm down a bit.
(guilty)
I kind of used the last of your camomile, but I’ll get you some more…
ALBA
Mm hmm.
HOLLY
Whatcha looking for? I can find it for you.
ALBA
Found it, thanks.
HOLLY
Alba, that’s not wild carrot, by the way, that’s poison hemlock…
ALBA
I know what I’m doing, Holly.
HOLLY
Alba? What are you doing?
ALBA
Just taking care of my patient.
HOLLY
You’re not going to… I mean, I know he’s annoying and all, but he’s just a kid! You can’t just kill him!
ALBA
I’ve got motive, means and opportunity. The monks all up and skipped town. Who’s going to know? Or care?
HOLLY
I can’t let you do this.
ALBA
Get out of my way, fairy.
HOLLY
Alba, I thought you were nice!
ALBA
(grimly)
Ha.
HOLLY
Or at least, I thought you were a good witch, but you’re…
ALBA
Yes?
HOLLY
I don’t know.
(beat)
Alba? Are you evil?
Pause.
ALBA
No. But I like having the option.
HOLLY
(lets out a breath)
Well, thank all the twinkly stars for that.
ALBA
Now get out of my way. I’ve gotta stitch up the idiot kid.
HOLLY
(clears her throat)
Hemlock. Hand it over.
ALBA
(sighs)
HOLLY
Thank you.
INT. PALACE
GUNTHER
Will the defendant please stand.
MAGNUS
Yo.
SOUND: Chair pushed back
GUNTHER
Brother Magnus of Hezelford, this court finds you guilty of endangering the public, destruction of royal property, causing a disturbance and making a complete mess of the new curtains.
MAGNUS
I object, your Kingship.
GUNTHER
Don’t get smart with me. I, Gunther the Third, King of Farloria, do sentence you to five thousand hours of community service.
MAGNUS
What?!
GUNTHER
Did I say five thousand? I meant six thousand.
MAGNUS
Dammit.
GUNTHER
To be served at the House of Healing under the care of Miss Alba Salix, Royal Physician…
ALBA
What?!
MAGNUS
(suddenly seeing the bright side)
Heeey…
GUNTHER
…in the hopes that she will be a good influence on your character and keep you out of trouble.
ALBA
Gunther, what are you thinking?
SOUND: Gavel bang
WALLA: Whispering
GUNTHER
Court is dismissed.
(to Alba)
Alba, I’m counting on you.
ALBA
Gunther! Wait!
MAGNUS
Hey there, boss.
ALBA
(sighs)
Hello, Magnus.
MAGNUS
You ready to rock?
ALBA
Fine. Let’s get back to the House of Healing.
MAGNUS
Sweet. You can give me my first lesson in black magic.
ALBA
All right, all right.
(leaving)
Have you ever had hemlock?
MAGNUS
(following)
No, is it good?

SOUND: Morning birds
SOUND: Knocking at wooden door
ALBA
Magnus. Time to get up.
MAGNUS
(muffled)
Okay, okay. Hold your horses, jeez.
SOUND: Door opens, clattering of tools
MAGNUS
(emerging)
Hey, it’s dark out, Alba. Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night?
ALBA
It’s practically dawn.
MAGNUS
Practically, but not actually dawn. Therefore, night.
ALBA
Here. Take this bottle. I need you to collect the dewdrops from the grass.
MAGNUS
What for?
ALBA
A lot of spells call for moondrops—dewdrops collected the night of a full moon.
MAGNUS
But that means bending over. I’m still wounded, you know.
ALBA
You’re fine. It’s time for you to start earning your keep.
(leaving)
Now get to it, before the sun comes up and they burn off.
MAGNUS
(calling after her)
This is inhumane treatment, you know.
(sighs)
SOUND: Soft rustling of grass
MAGNUS
(muttering)
Come on. Dammit, this thing’s too small. She could at least give me a jar or a funnel or something.
BIRD
I offer thee a tiny clue.
MAGNUS
What? Who’s there? Whoa… was that you?
BIRD
I offer thee a tiny clue to catch the precious morning dew.
MAGNUS
You’re a bird.
SOUND: Bird twitter
MAGNUS
It must be the sleep deprivation. I need coffee.
BIRD
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNUS
Excuse me?
BIRD
Into the bottle it will pop.
MAGNUS
You’re not serious.
BIRD
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNUS
I am not singing a song to a bunch of dewdrops.
(fussing)
I already look like enough of a loser trying to catch dewdrops in a tiny… dammit…
BIRD
Sing a song.
MAGNUS
I’m not singing! Go away! Do I tell you how to do your job?
BIRD
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNUS
(giving chase)
Scram! Beat it! Go catch a worm or something. Hee-yah!
SOUND: Shovel picked up and thrown
BIRD
(running away)
Into the bottle it will pop!
MAGNUS
Go ahead. One more rhyme and I’ll show you my advanced shovel technique.
SOUND: Annoyed twittering
MAGNUS
Yeah, same to you!
(yawns)
All right. Dewdrops…
SOUND: Holly’s wings, approaching
HOLLY
(flying in, sleepy and spacey)
Good morning!
MAGNUS
Wrong on both counts.
HOLLY
Oh, Magnus. It’s a beautiful morning. And last night!
(sighs happily)
I flew to the stone circle in the Golden Glade with eleven other fairies. We did a dance to the full moon, and tried this amazing wine I made from star-berries…
MAGNUS
Well, aren’t you just special.
HOLLY
Aw. Why are you such a grumpy goose?
MAGNUS
Let’s see… I’m forced into hard labour despite my life-threatening injuries. And at night I have to sleep in the toolshed. But no, wait, I’m not allowed to sleep because it’s four A.M. and time to gather dewdrops in a thimble.
HOLLY
Oh, moondrops. Of course! Are you singing to them?
MAGNUS
Holly… don’t you start, too. Some bird’s already been trying to tell me how to do it.
HOLLY
You should always listen to the birds and animals. They’re your friends!
MAGNUS
My friends have bigger vocabularies.
HOLLY
So. The dewdrops in Alba’s garden usually like the key of B flat major. It all depends on the type of grass. Watch.
(sings)
Come, spring from your leaves, each glimmering bead…
SOUND: Tiny drip
HOLLY
See?
MAGNUS
Holly, I am not singing to Alba’s front lawn.
HOLLY
It’s easy.
MAGNUS
Well, you do it, then.
WALLA: PANICKY VOICES, HUSHED, MIDDLE DISTANCE
SOUND: Urgent door-knocking
HOLLY
(takes a breath and resumes singing)
Each glimmering…
(stops abruptly)
Oh my gosh. They’re bringing someone in.
MAGNUS
Oh. Yeah… looks like an emergency case. We better go see.
HOLLY
You should stay and get the dewdrops before they’re gone.
MAGNUS
Hey… why don’t I go, and you get the dewdrops?
HOLLY
(calling)
Remember, B‑flat!
SOUND: Holly flies off
MAGNUS
Yeah, like I know from B‑flat. Well, thanks a million.
(pause; then sings, badly and trying not to be heard)
Spring from your leaves… every glimmering bead…
(sighs)
I hate my life.
MUSIC: OPENING THEME
HERALD
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Second: The Labours of Magnus.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
ALBA
Holly. There you are.
HOLLY
(arriving)
Hi Alba! Sorry I’m late.
ALBA
I need the Silver Star ointment, the Quick-Knit compresses and a pair of pliers.
HOLLY
You got it.
SOUND: Pantry door
ALBA
(announcing)
Patient is male, mid-forties, with a deep puncture to the right leg and probable concussion.
HOLLY
(returning)
Wait, I know him… that’s Jerome! The guy who was in here the other day for his gout, right?
ALBA
And the day before that for a cold, and the day before that…
HOLLY
And now he’s got an arrow in his leg? Talk about unlucky!
ALBA
You have to wonder.
HOLLY
What happened?
ALBA
Just before sunrise, his son heard a commotion in the henhouse, thought it was a wolf and shot him in the leg with a crossbow. Jerome tried to run, tripped over a blue bantam rooster and cracked his head on a stone.
HOLLY
Wow… he got a goose egg from a chicken?
ALBA
Fell right on his wounded leg too. Luckily he hasn’t lost too much blood, but we’ll have to be careful not to damage the femoral artery…
MAGNUS
(entering)
What’s up. Whoa, did he take a crossbow bolt to the leg? That’s heavy duty. Can I help take it out?
ALBA
I’d rather keep my patient, thanks. Holly, I need seven drops of the ointment, all around where the arrow went in.
HOLLY
Sure thing.
MAGNUS
Isn’t that the Jerome guy you always complain about?
ALBA
The very one.
MAGNUS
Well, hey, now’s your moment!
ALBA
My moment to what?
MAGNUS
You know… off him.
HOLLY
Magnus!
ALBA
I didn’t off you.
MAGNUS
Well, clearly you knew a good thing when you saw it.
ALBA
We all make mistakes.
SOUND: Clinking of eyedropper in bottle
MAGNUS
I can do that. I can clean out the wound if you want.
JEROME
(howls in pain, though still asleep)
HOLLY
Oh my gosh, I’m sorry, Jerome!
MAGNUS
See, she’s doing it wrong.
ALBA
No, no, I think he’s having a reaction to something the ointment.
MAGNUS
Maybe he objects to being treated by a fairy.
HOLLY
Maybe he objects to the presence of a nasty human.
MAGNUS
Holly, you shouldn’t talk about Alba like that.
ALBA
That’s very odd. Couldn’t be the silver, could it?
HOLLY
I’ll make up a Sanitas tincture. That should disinfect without causing a reaction.
ALBA
No, it won’t be as effective.
MAGNUS
Yeah, Holly.
HOLLY
It is so effective!
ALBA
Hand me the amulet hanging on the door. Second hook.
SOUND: Fine chain jingles
MAGNUS
This one?
ALBA
Thanks.
MAGNUS
(laying it on thick)
You’re welcome, Alba.
ALBA
Munda me. Clarifica me, Clara. (MOON-da MAY. cla-REEF-ica MAY)
SOUND: Whispery magic flourish
HOLLY
(quietly, a mantra)
I’m a good fairy and I help people. I’m a good fairy and I… Ooh, pretty!
ALBA
Right, let’s get that arrow out. Holly, get ready to apply pressure on the wound.
HOLLY
Sure thing.
MAGNUS
I know this technique that we learned back at the monastery where you can melt wood. I bet that would work.
ALBA
I need you to stay out of the way, Magnus.
MAGNUS
I totally studied this! My mind has power over wood!
SOUND: Big jug picked up
ALBA
You want something to do? Here. Go up the road to the royal stables and gather up the saltpeter from under the manure pile.
MAGNUS
What?
ALBA
Saltpeter. It leaches out of the manure as it ages.
MAGNUS
I know where it comes from. But why me? Why can’t Holly do it?
ALBA
I need her help in here.
MAGNUS
I can do surgery!
ALBA
Magnus.
MAGNUS
(getting whiny)
C’mon. Why do you think they call it saltpeter? It causes… wiltage.
HOLLY
Wiltage?
MAGNUS
Wiltage of the…
(uncomfortable)
the peter.
ALBA
You aren’t going to eat any, are you?
HOLLY
And anyway, why does that matter if you’re a monk? I thought you had power over wood.
MAGNUS
It saps the essential masculine energy that I need to perform amazing feats of martial arts.
ALBA
That works out nicely then. Get out there and shovel.
MAGNUS
(leaving)
Hmph. This is why my prior warned me not to consort with women!
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
ALBA
(calling)
You should have listened to him.
(to Holly)
Now then. Bend the leg towards me, please, and hold the bandage there.
JEROME
(whimpers foggily in his sleep)
HOLLY
Okay. Hang in there, Jerome…
ALBA
Maybe Magnus was right. If I didn’t have this dope coming to me every day for his nonexistent problems, I could have so much time back…
HOLLY
Alba, that’s an awful thing to say.
ALBA
Having second thoughts about doing good deeds for an evil witch?
HOLLY
You aren’t evil, you just need someone to help. And keep an eye on you.
INT. STABLES, MORNING
SOUND: Morning birds, distant horse snorts and whinnies
SOUND: Scraping of pitchfork
SOUND: Squirrel chitter
MAGNUS
Damn witches and fairies. Trying to keep a good man down. Gods, it stinks out here!
SQUIRREL
Dance a turn with yonder broom.
MAGNUS
What? Oh. Great, now it’s squirrels giving me advice.
SQUIRREL
Dance a turn with yonder broom. Thy labours will be over soon.
MAGNUS
Bite me. I’m not dancing. My manhood’s already suffering enough damage.
SQUIRREL
Dance a turn with yonder broom.
MAGNUS
Go away! Git! Damn rodent! Hya!
SOUND: Pitchfork whooshing and clanging, angry chittering
SQUIRREL
Dance a turn with yonder broom!
MAGNUS
Beady-eyed little freak! Take that! Hai! Hoo!
(toppling over)
Whoaaaa!
SOUND: Heavy squelch; pitchfork clatters to the ground
MAGNUS
Augh! Crap.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
JEROME
Ughh…
ALBA
That should do it, I think.
HOLLY
Alba, I think he’s coming round.
JEROME
(sleepily)
Oh dear. Oh, ouch, ouch, what’s wrong with my…
HOLLY
Easy there, Jerome… you bumped your head.
JEROME
What’s going on?
HOLLY
You’re at the House of Healing. Easy now. Try not to move that leg either.
JEROME
My leg?
ALBA
Do you remember being shot with a crossbow?
JEROME
No… I just remember… the moon, and… chickens everywhere…
ALBA
Quit moving around, Jerome.
JEROME
I know you…
ALBA
Yes. Sadly.
JEROME
Al… Alba? I remember you, you’re nice.
HOLLY
He’s delirious. Jerome? How many fingers am I holding up?
JEROME
Chickens… tasty chickens…
SOUND: Door opens and shuts; squishy footsteps approach
HOLLY
Jerome?
ALBA
I definitely like him better concussed. Ugh, where’s that smell coming from?
(sternly)
Jerome?
JEROME
Wuh?
HOLLY
Magnus! What happened?
MAGNUS
(arriving)
Everybody just shut up.
ALBA
Magnus, what…?
(Sighs)
Please stop tracking manure everywhere. Why don’t you wash up outside?
MAGNUS
Your neighbourhood is full of smug, smartass woodland creatures and they all hate me.
JEROME
(a groan, almost dog-like)
HOLLY
Jerome, you really have to relax. Alba, I’m going to make up a Samstrong’s potion for Jerome.
ALBA
Did Magnus get enough moondrops?
SOUND: A desk bell rings
MAGNUS
Hey, someone’s at the counter!
COUNTESS
(from the other room, cheerful)
Hello! Excuse me!
ALBA
Oh, drat, I forgot. Countess Carnelia has an appointment this morning. If it’s not one thing, it’s eighteen hundred other things…
COUNTESS
I say. Hellooo!
HOLLY
She sounds nice.
SOUND: Rummaging with jars
ALBA
Ridiculous woman. Of course, she is a friend of Parabel’s. Won’t take any medicine I give her, unless it’s leeches… Dammit. Magnus!
MAGNUS
Now what?
ALBA
We’re fresh out of leeches. I need you to gather another jug of them from the pond out back.
MAGNUS
Yup, that’s why I studied surgery at the Monastery, so I could shovel crap and fetch leeches.
ALBA
Magnus.
MAGNUS
Fine, how do I catch them?
ALBA
Easy. You go to the pond, roll up your trousers and wade in.
MAGNUS
Oh, that sounds like fun.
ALBA
Or I could get a pair of scissors and we can study surgery on your liver.
JEROME
(dreamily)
Liver…
MAGNUS
Okay, okay.
SOUND: Jug hefted, then footsteps
ALBA
(calling after him)
And make sure to pry the leeches off. Never squeeze them.
MAGNUS
Whatever!
SOUND: Door slams
INT. RECEPTION, CONTINUOUS
SOUND: Desk bell
COUNTESS
Hellooo!
ALBA
(entering)
Your Ladyship.
COUNTESS
Miss Salix! Good morning.
ALBA
Sorry to keep you waiting. How have you been?
COUNTESS
Oh, busy, busy, you know how it is, the life of a patron and philanthropist…
ALBA
Of course! That reminds me… the Queen suggested you might be inclined to make a small donation to the House of Healing?
COUNTESS
(uncomfortable)
Yes, well. I’ll have to talk it over with my bookkeeper. I’m… reorganizing my giving portfolio, you see. And I’ve been so dreadfully busy of late…
ALBA
All those salons and parties must have you positively exhausted.
COUNTESS
Oh, you have no idea. It’s been taking a terrible toll, Miss Salix—my health has been in tatters. Just look! My hands are swollen again and my face is red as a beet…
ALBA
Your hands look fine to me.
COUNTESS
Oh, no, no. They may look fine but my hand specialist always told me I’m at great risk of fatsoplasia.
ALBA
You don’t say.
COUNTESS
And my ear, nose and toenail specialist is warning me I have too much blood in my bloodstream. Look how red I am!
ALBA
Your Ladyship, you’re about as red as an albino snowman who’s seen a ghost.
COUNTESS
But that’s only the outward aspect. A healer such as yourself should know the difference between mere appearances and true inner redness.
ALBA
Yes, of course.
COUNTESS
I need more leeches—I think the ones you gave me are too full.
ALBA
My assistant is just fetching you some now. Did you drink the tincture I gave you?
COUNTESS
Eugh. That stinking, undrinkable pink tincture?
ALBA
I really think you should drink that tincture.
COUNTESS
I tried, but I simply couldn’t.
ALBA
You’ll let leeches stick themselves to you, but you won’t take a simple herbal—
COUNTESS
Miss Salix, isn’t there anything you can do?
ALBA
(under her breath)
I could stitch your mouth shut for a start.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
JEROME
Uhhhh…
HOLLY
Hey there, Jerome. I just need you to drink this.
JEROME
What’s that?
HOLLY
It’s a Samstrong’s Healing Extreme potion. Made with fresh dewdrops, so it’s got all the healing power of the full moon.
JEROME
The moon? I like the moooon.
(drinks)
HOLLY
I know, me too!
(leaving)
Just take it easy and I’ll be back in a few minutes.
JEROME
I like the mooooon…
(it starts to turn into a howl)
EXT. LEECH POND, DAY
SOUND: Songbirds, ducks
SOUND: Water sloshes
MAGNUS
(to himself, near panic)
Oh, jeez dangit heck I should have stayed at the monastery. Okay. Pry it off, don’t squeeze. Pry it off, don’t squeeze. Urrghghhh!
SOUND: Tiny pop and splash
MAGNUS
Urgh… that’s one. Wait, that’s it? One leech? C’mon… please don’t make me wade back in there…
(pause, then calls)
Okay, guys, I’m ready. I’ll dance or sing or whatever as long as I don’t have to go back in the leech pond. Guys? People of the animal kingdom? Figures. They’re never there when you need them…
(muttering, under the following)
Living on nuts and berries. I know they’re laughing at us.
SOUND: Fluttering wings arrive
BIRD
(whispering)
This oughta fix him.
SQUIRREL
(whispering)
What’s in the vial?
BIRD
(whispering)
Stole it from the witch’s pantry. You’ll see.
(clears throat)
Greetings, human child.
MAGNUS
Oh, hey, Mister Bird. Sorry about earlier.
BIRD
Think nothing of it.
MAGNUS
Um, any tips on collecting leeches? So far I got a total of one.
BIRD
One is all you need. Leeches just need the right food, you see.
MAGNUS
I am not letting them feed on me, thank you very much.
BIRD
No need for blood. I got something a thousand times more powerful.
MAGNUS
Aren’t you supposed to talk in rhyme?
BIRD
Sometimes you gotta improvise. Break loose. De-versify, you might say. Here, take this vial.
MAGNUS
(reading)
“Drake’s Jelly”. What’s drake’s jelly?
SQUIRREL
(delighted)
Nooo. You didn’t!
BIRD
(aside)
Zip it, squirrel. You trying to blow this?
(to Magnus)
It’s a growth formula—a multiplication factor.
MAGNUS
It makes leeches multiply?
BIRD
(evasive)
Something like that.
SOUND: Tiny clink
MAGNUS
Okay. As long as there’s no dancing. How do you know all this stuff, anyway?
BIRD
You learn a lot when you hang around a witch’s house.
MAGNUS
Hey, he likes it! He’s actually going for it.
BIRD
Welp, gotta fly! Nests to build, songs to sing…
MAGNUS
He’s getting bigger. Cool. Do they divide in half, like amoebas, and camels?
BIRD
Later, human!
MAGNUS
(distracted)
Right! Thanks for the tip.
SOUND: Fizzing
MAGNUS
Wow, he’s really growing fast.
SOUND: Splashing
SOUND: Tiny, rasping screech
MAGNUS
Holy crap. Bird! What is this stuff?! What did you do?
SOUND: Screech, slightly bigger
SOUND: Jug being stoppered
MAGNUS
Oh gods. Goodbye, liver. I’ll miss you.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
COUNTESS
I want a test for fatsoplasia.
ALBA
But that’s not what you have, your Ladyship.
COUNTESS
I know what I have! On account of being the one who has it!
ALBA
You’re showing none of the symptoms.
HOLLY
(entering)
Jerome’s had his potion, Alba.
ALBA
Thanks Holly. Can you go check on Magnus?
HOLLY
Will do.
COUNTESS
My colour specialist was telling me I should be taking moosemint leaf.
ALBA
(skeptical)
I suppose that wouldn’t hurt…
COUNTESS
Would you please provide me with some, in that case?
ALBA
Why are you coming to see me if you have all these specialists?
COUNTESS
(caught)
Well… you are the Royal Physician, appointed by the King himself.
ALBA
So, nothing to do with the fact that treatment at the House of Healing is paid for by the King himself.
COUNTESS
I don’t know what you’re insinuating.
ALBA
I’m sure you don’t.
COUNTESS
Do you have any moosemint?
ALBA
No. None.
COUNTESS
Well, so much for nationalized medicine.
ALBA
Do you actually pay any taxes?
COUNTESS
Where are my leeches?
EXT. GARDEN
MAGNUS
(chummy)
Hey, Holly…
HOLLY
Hi Magnus! How did you do with the leeches?
MAGNUS
Good, good. Say, this is just a hypothetical question…
HOLLY
Yes?
MAGNUS
If you were going to shrink something, like with magic, how would you do it?
HOLLY
Is this about the saltpeter?
MAGNUS
No, it’s about the lee… it’s about learning basic magic concepts, which I’m trying to do, as an apprentice.
HOLLY
Magnus. You know fibbing causes acne.
MAGNUS
Not fibbing!
HOLLY
What did you do? Is it the leeches?
MAGNUS
No.
SOUND: Leech screech, muffled
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Maybe.
HOLLY
What did you do?
MAGNUS
It wasn’t me! It was your friend the bird! Honest!
HOLLY
Let me see that jug.
MAGNUS
No! Don’t open it!
SOUND: Big stopper pulled, and a burbling screech, louder and deeper
HOLLY
Yeow!
MAGNUS
Put the lid back on! Put it on!
SOUND: Burbling; stopper wrestled back in
HOLLY
(breathless)
Magnus! What did you do?
MAGNUS
It was the bird! He told me to feed them drake’s jelly!
SOUND: Muffled screech
HOLLY
What? You know what drake’s jelly is, don’t you?
MAGNUS
It’s this green stuff that comes in a tiny bottle…
HOLLY
It’s where baby dragons come from.
MAGNUS
What?!
HOLLY
Worms and leeches are the larval stage.
MAGNUS
For dragons.
HOLLY
Yes! Earthworms turn into hill dragons, leeches turn into water dragons, nematodes turn into vinegar dragons… But they don’t do that unless they eat drake’s jelly.
MAGNUS
And where does that come from?
HOLLY
From dragons, silly. It comes out of these glands they have under their—
SOUND: Screech
MAGNUS
That’s a real dragon in there?
HOLLY
Yeah. Gosh, he had big jaws.
MAGNUS
All the better to eat us with.
SOUND: Distant door slam, and businesslike footsteps
HOLLY
Uh oh.
ALBA
(approaching)
Magnus, what’s taking so long?
MAGNUS
(freaked)
Hi Alba!
ALBA
Please tell me you’ve managed to catch some leeches.
MAGNUS
I, uh… why, yes, as a matter of fact, they’re right here. Uh, you don’t have to open it though! I was just thinking maybe there weren’t enough of them. I thought I’d go back for some more.
HOLLY
Magnus has something to tell you, don’t you, Magnus?
MAGNUS
Well. I. That is…
ALBA
Yes?
SOUND: Door again, and running footsteps
COUNTESS
(a distant scream, then, approaching)
Help! Mad dog! Horrible, filthy beast! Help!
JEROME
(close behind, barking happily)
Whoof? Rarf! Woof!
(pants)
ALBA
Toby! What are you doing here?
COUNTESS
Get this thing away! It’s sniffing me!
ALBA
Off. Toby, get off the Countess. Sorry, Your Ladyship. That’s just Toby. He sort of… turns up every once in a while.
JEROME
Urrf!
COUNTESS
Horrible creature! It’s probably full of diseases…
ALBA
He’s fine. Toby, off. Scram.
JEROME
(whines)
SOUND: Dog footsteps recede
COUNTESS
You can be sure I won’t be donating any money to this place.
ALBA
Oh well.
COUNTESS
Is that my jug of leeches?
MAGNUS
Well, you see, it’s, uh, not a very nice jug, and I thought—
ALBA
Just give the Countess her damned leeches and she’ll be on her way.
HOLLY
(worried)
Um… Alba, that’s not a good idea…
COUNTESS
Give me that jug!
SOUND: Jug snatched, water sloshes
COUNTESS (CONT’D)
Honestly.
ALBA
(hurrying things along)
There you are. So lovely to see you again, your Ladyship.
COUNTESS
Not so fast. You’d better not be trying to cheat me.
SOUND: Squeaking of stopper
MAGNUS
No!
HOLLY
Don’t open it! Magnus, tell them.
MAGNUS
Honest! There’s lots in that jug. I counted twice.
COUNTESS
(straining with the stopper)
I’m supposed to believe you, you unsanitary little man?
MAGNUS
And it’s a very tricky stopper and you won’t be able to get it back in.
ALBA
Yes! You’ve got your leeches, now have a lovely day and hope you feel better soon.
COUNTESS
What are you all trying to hide?
MAGNUS
Nothing! But the leeches are… very sensitive to light.
COUNTESS
(straining again)
For heaven’s sake.
HOLLY
(unable to contain herself)
Countess, you can’t have that jug! There’s a giant dragon in there!
Silence.
MAGNUS
(weakly)
Heh!
ALBA
Holly, what’s gotten into you?
COUNTESS
I’ve never heard such rubbish in my life.
MAGNUS
Yeah, Holly. What rubbish.
(suddenly urgent)
But no, seriously, Countess! I’d wait until you get home to…
SOUND: Pung! the lid pops. a huge screech, slithering
COUNTESS
(screams)
SOUND: Jug smashes on the ground, water splatters. burbly screech
MAGNUS
…open it.
ALBA
Magnus!
MAGNUS
It’s not my fault!
ALBA
That’s a water dragon.
HOLLY
Ohh! He’s beautiful!
ALBA
What have you done now?
MAGNUS
I deny everything!
SOUND: Screech
ALBA
Get back!
HOLLY
He’s already so much bigger. Who’s a good little dragon?
SOUND: Screech and snap of jaws, slithering, and heavy snorting breathing
(continues under)
COUNTESS
Help! We’re cornered! It’s going to eat us!
ALBA
(calmly)
Mister Dragon.
HOLLY
I’m gonna call him… Langley.
ALBA
I’m guessing you’re too young to understand what I’m saying, but we’re not going to hurt you. We’re just going to edge along this wall toward the back door if that’s all right.
SOUND: Warning screech
COUNTESS
(screams)
MAGNUS
That’s pretty much a no.
ALBA
So much for diplomacy.
MAGNUS
I bet I could take him. Want me to subdue him?
HOLLY
Magnus, you be nice to Langley.
ALBA
He’s agitated enough as it is.
SOUND: Hiss!
COUNTESS
Get it away from me! Kill it!
ALBA
Your Ladyship, please pull yourself together.
COUNTESS
Do something!
HOLLY
You’re both scaring him. There, there, little guy…
SOUND: Snarl
COUNTESS
No! Get it away!
ALBA
For heaven’s sake. Aurei somni oculos implebunt.
(AW-ree SOM-nee OC-you-los im-PLAY-bunt)
SOUND: Magic noise, fizzles
MAGNUS
(after a moment)
What did that do?
SOUND: Dragon hiss
ALBA
I guess that sleeping spell doesn’t work on dragons.
COUNTESS
(sleepy)
Get… away… thing… breathing on me…
(snores)
SOUND: Body falls to the ground
ALBA
Works on countesses, at least.
SOUND: Quieter bellow, snuffling
ALBA (CONT’D)
Now you listen, dragon. That’s the Countess Carnelia. She’s my patient and the Queen’s best friend… so you’d better eat all of her. I don’t want any evidence.
HOLLY
Alba! Come on, Langley. Let’s get you down to the seaside where you can get something proper to eat—
SOUND: Louder bellow and snap of teeth
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Eeek! Langley, be nice!
MAGNUS
If only I had some kind of weapon.
ALBA
Magnus, leave it. And Holly, quit trying to pet him. Listen, you’re the only one who can fly. I need you to—
SOUND: Dog running
JEROME
(angry)
Woof! Woof woof rarf ruff woof!
ALBA
Toby! Be careful!
MAGNUS
That is one weird looking dog.
SOUND: Dragon screech
ALBA
Holly, now! While he’s distracted—get inside. Get me the glass wand and the duckweed pollen.
HOLLY
Duckweed pollen? Ohh… of course! That’s a great idea.
ALBA
Go! Now!
HOLLY
Okay!
SOUND: Holly’s wings, zooming off
SOUND: Screech
JEROME
Woof! Whuff! Rarf!
MAGNUS
Yup, lead him on, just a little further… that’s it… don’t mind me…
ALBA
Magnus, what are you doing?
SOUND: Shovel clank
MAGNUS
Ha ha! Hyah! Get back, foul fiend! I have the power of Shovel!
ALBA
That’s not helping.
SOUND: Screech, cut short by the plang! of a shovel connecting, then a confused, groggy bellow and MORE THRASHING
ALBA (CONT’D)
Magnus!
MAGNUS
Yeah! Snicker-snack, baby! Ya like that?
(jerked off his feet)
Hwaaaugh!
SOUND: Dragon bellow, and the shovel falls to the ground. then, scrambling and scraping
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
(dragged off into the distance)
Craaap! Help! Alba!
JEROME
Whurrf?
ALBA
Good boy, Toby. You saved us all from being eaten.
JEROME
(proudly)
Ruff!
(pants)
MAGNUS
Help! Nice dragon…
(being squeezed)
Oooof!
ALBA
Well, close enough.
SOUND: Holly’s wings, approaching
HOLLY
Wow. They grow up so fast, don’t they? He’s been a dragon for fifteen minutes and he can already climb a wall while carrying a gangly human boy.
ALBA
I just had that roof replaced, too.
MAGNUS
Alba! He’s drooling on me! Help?
JEROME
Rurf?
HOLLY
I didn’t know you had a dog, Alba.
ALBA
Oh, no, Toby’s not mine… he just shows up every few weeks.
HOLLY
Aw, he likes you! Look, he wants tummy rubs.
ALBA
(softening)
He’s all right.
(fondly)
Oh, Toby.
HOLLY
He’s got such a funny build, though. Like a walrus terrier or a… Alba, he couldn’t be a werewolf, could he?
ALBA
He’s not a werewolf. It’s broad daylight, in case you hadn’t noticed. Although, come to think of it, I’ve never seen him during the day before…
MAGNUS
Guys? Little help with this dragon? He’s trying to eat my hea—
(suddenly muffled)
Mmphh!
HOLLY
I guess we should see to Langley, huh?
ALBA
I suppose we should.
HOLLY
I take it the duckweed pollen is for a shrinking spell?
ALBA
Exactly. I need you to fly up there and sprinkle the pollen on the dragon’s back. Then tap him three times with this glass wand and say “Non est parvum vos sentio”.
HOLLY
“Non est parvum vos sentio.”
(taking off)
Got it!
SOUND: Wings, continued throughout
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Hi Langley. It’s just me! Hold still now…
MAGNUS
Mmmph!
SOUND: Glittery magic, then three little tink! noises
HOLLY
Non est parvum vos sentio!
SOUND: Rubbery, stretchy noises, a squelchy pop
MAGNUS
(gasping for breath)
Aghh! N‑nice dragon… friends now?
SOUND: Langley bellows, but the sound shrinks to a tiny squeak
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Whoa, whoa! Holly, what did you do?!
(sliding)
Agh! I can’t get a grip on the roof!
HOLLY
I gotcha, I gotcha!
MAGNUS
Aaaaaa!
SOUND: Slipping and sliding, then a crash of branches and roof tiles
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Oww! I thought you said “I gotcha!”
HOLLY
(fawning)
Poor little Langley. Was it scary up there?
SOUND: Tiny langley bellow
SOUND: Holly lands
ALBA
Thank goodness that worked.
MAGNUS
I’m falling to my death and who does she rescue?
HOLLY
He’s hungry and scared, and besides, you had the shrubbery to break your fall.
MAGNUS
I hate you all. Have I mentioned?
COUNTESS
(waking up)
What… what happened?
ALBA
Your Ladyship! Are you all right?
COUNTESS
You. What am I doing at the House of Healing?
ALBA
(with exaggerated sympathy)
You passed out.
COUNTESS
There was a horrible thing… it tried to eat me…
ALBA
It sounds terrible. You must have been having a nightmare.
COUNTESS
Yes, that’s it… just a nightmare…
JEROME
(happy)
Rowr ruff woof!
COUNTESS
(screams)
Get it away! Help! Help! Guards! Someone!
(recedes into the distance)
SOUND: Footsteps
ALBA
(calling)
Good boy, Toby! Remind me to give him a biscuit.
MAGNUS
That figures.
ALBA
Fine. I’ll give you a biscuit too.
SOUND: Tiny bellow
HOLLY
I should get this little guy down to the seaside before he gets big again.
ALBA
Yes, do you mind? Take him up north of the Cape, if you have time.
SOUND: Wings
HOLLY
(zooming off)
C’mon, Langley! Let’s hit the beach!
MAGNUS
So! That turned out okay.
ALBA
Magnus.
MAGNUS
Yes Ma’am.
ALBA
How exactly did that leech manage to come into contact with drake’s jelly?
MAGNUS
It was the bird’s fault! I guess she didn’t like me for some reason, and she gave me this bottle of…
ALBA
This is my bottle. From my pantry.
MAGNUS
Yeah! She must have got in through the window. Which Holly still hasn’t fixed.
ALBA
A bird stole it. Is that the best you can come up with?
MAGNUS
Honest! I’d never heard of the stuff. The bird said it would make them multiply…
ALBA
(relenting just a little)
You lived at the Dragon Mountain monastery and you never knew where dragons come from?
MAGNUS
I guess no one sat me down and had that little talk. It’s not like it comes up a lot in day to day medicine, is it?
ALBA
I suppose not.
(calling)
Toby! Hm. Where’d he go?
(sighs)
Oh well. He never stays for long. It’s as if there’s a voice, calling him on, down the road…
JEROME
(groggy)
Ohhh. Where am I?
ALBA
Jerome, what are you doing out here? You need to rest. And for heaven’s sake, put some clothes on.
JEROME
Okay.
SOUND: Footsteps recede
ALBA
(leaving)
Look, you’re ruining the dressings we put on you.
JEROME
(following)
Sorry, Alba.
ALBA
(over her shoulder)
Magnus, clean up all those roof tiles.
MAGNUS
(sighs)
Fine…
SOUND: Door opens and shuts
SOUND: Shoveling debris
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
I think I broke another bone.
RABBIT
Ahem.
MAGNUS
What? Who’s there?
RABBIT
Let the tiles lay where they fell—except for one, and smash it well!
MAGNUS
Oh, no you don’t! I’m not taking any bogus household hints from a rabbit! Beat it! Heeyah! Hoowah!
SOUND: Shovel whirling and clanking; something smashes
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
(cringing)
Ohgods!
ALBA
(from inside)
Magnus!
MAGNUS
Sorry!

Liverwort, spleenwort, brainwort… uh…
HOLLY
(whispering)
Kidneywort.
MAGNUS
(whispering)
I was getting to that.
HOLLY
Just trying to help…
MAGNUS
(aloud)
Kidneywort and Left Pinky Finger-wort.
ALBA
Good. Name three natural anaesthetics.
MAGNUS
Nodding rose, napping violet and blunt trauma.
ALBA
Why do I bother?
MAGNUS
Fine, snoozeweed.
ALBA
Thank you. I suppose this apprenticeship might not be a complete waste.
MAGNUS
You know what would really be worthwhile, though, is if you taught me some magic.
SOUND: Distant clank and crash from outside
HOLLY
(alarmed)
Um, Alba… speaking of herbs… what’s happened to the garden?
ALBA
What? Oh! Who the hell is that? Gods, they’re tearing everything out!
(running out)
Hey! Get out of my garden!
EXT. GARDEN, CONTINUOUS
SOUND: Morning birds
SOUND: Shovels clanking, cracking of branches
SOUND: Door opens. shovels stop
ALBA
(running up)
Hey! Stop that this minute!
JAN
(furtive)
Oh gods, it’s her!
ALBA
Just what do you think you’re doing?
DOUGLAS
Um. Nothing.
JAN
Nothing, Ma’am.
BAILIFF
(approaching)
Excuse me, madam. Is there a problem?
ALBA
Bailiff Henry. What are your men doing destroying my herb garden?
BAILIFF
Merely enforcing the law, madam.
ALBA
I beg your pardon?
SOUND: Rustling paper
BAILIFF
(clears his throat)
“A Royal Decree on the Aesthetic Character of the Royal Lands, County Grandville…”
SOUND: Paper snatched
ALBA
Give me that.
(skimming it)
“All buildings within sight of the Palace to be painted in selected shades of pink…”
BAILIFF
It’s Sub-Section Eight.
ALBA
“Garden at the House of Healing to be torn out and replanted according to Palace standards!”
BAILIFF
There you are.
ALBA
I don’t believe this.
BAILIFF
All right, you men. Stop gawping and get back to it.
DOUGLAS
(scared)
Sir?
BAILIFF
What? What’s gotten into you two? You think she’s going to curse you or something?
JAN
(hushed)
I heard she was the one made Mickey Hutter’s ears fall off.
DOUGLAS
She made the birds peck old Mrs Angley to death.
BAILIFF
She never did that.
ALBA
Oh, didn’t I?
JAN
She’s the Queen’s sister! She’ll have us killed!
BAILIFF
(a little desperate)
Finish the job or it’s two days’ pay docked for both of you!
JAN
With respect, Sir, we wish to resign.
DOUGLAS
I cannot work today on account of I have a terrible cold.
BAILIFF
We have orders—
ALBA
Bailiff, I would be quite happy if your men were to cease work right now. And if they were, perhaps, to help salvage what they’ve torn up, I would be even happier. Otherwise, well… I won’t be responsible for their safety.
JAN
(beat)
Sir?
BAILIFF
I think perhaps we could come to some arrangement.
MUSIC: OPENING THEME
HERALD
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Third: Into the Woeful Woods.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
SOUND: Simmering, and rustling leaves
HOLLY
You’re doing it wrong…
MAGNUS
I am not doing it wrong.
HOLLY
You’re supposed to put the nettles into the water after it starts boiling.
MAGNUS
No one asked you, fairy.
SOUND: Interior door and footsteps
HOLLY
You’re gonna waste an entire bag of leaves.
MAGNUS
Holly, I don’t need tea-making lessons from a hopped-up pixie.
HOLLY
(silent, then suddenly dangerous)
What did you call me.
MAGNUS
A clumsy, mushroom-addled pixie.
SOUND: Angry buzz of wings
HOLLY
Magnus. Don’t you ever call me a pixie.
MAGNUS
I just did. Twice.
(blurts)
Pixie. Oops! Three times.
HOLLY
Don’t associate my name with those people. My Mama and my Grandma fought their kind for years.
MAGNUS
I thought you fairies believed in peace and hugs and whiskers on gryphons.
HOLLY
Not when it comes to pixies! They eat cornflower husks! They bite their toenails!
MAGNUS
You “fought” them? What was it, a cider drinking contest?
SOUND: Holly zooms in and whacks magnus
MAGNUS
Ow! Dammit!
HOLLY
Take it back!
MAGNUS
Get away from me!
SOUND: Chaos: holly flying in circles while magnus swings at her with a broom. smashing and clattering
HOLLY
Take it back! Take it back!
MAGNUS
Pixie! Mushroom fiend!
ALBA
(entering)
What in Hades is going on?!
HOLLY
Take back what you said!
MAGNUS
I bet you kiss bumblebees!
HOLLY
Yeah, well you’re a mean, lazy, good for-nothing young human… youngster!
SOUND: An enormous crash.
HOLLY
Ow!
ALBA
Holly! Magnus!
SOUND: Deathly quiet except for an occasional tinkle of glass bits
ALBA
Well?
MAGNUS
She started it.
HOLLY
(winded)
I did not! He insulted my people!
MAGNUS
Just telling it like it is.
ALBA
Children!
HOLLY
Sorry.
MAGNUS
(simultaneously)
I’m not a…! Sorry.
ALBA
First the bailiff and his lackeys take out my garden, and now you two have wrecked half the pantry.
(sighs)
That was my last bottle of gossamer fern extract. And the doleful goatweed.
HOLLY
I’m sorry, Alba. We’ll replace them all.
ALBA
Yes, you will.
HOLLY
If I have to travel to the ends of the earth.
ALBA
There’s an idea. And take Magnus with you.
HOLLY
I shall atone for my… wait. Magnus? I’m not taking him!
SOUND: Scribbling
ALBA
Yes, you are. You are both going to go out and collect the ingredients on this list.
MAGNUS
Can’t we just go to an apothecary?
ALBA
On my budget?
MAGNUS
I see. The kingdom’s health care system is founded on slave labour.
ALBA
You noticed.
HOLLY
(reading)
Gossamer fern, chuckle briar… golden bellweed?
(worried)
Alba, that only grows in the green grove in the deepest depths of the Woeful Woods.
ALBA
Well, that should narrow down your search.
HOLLY
But those woods are all full of badgers and bears!
MAGNUS
I thought the animals were our friends? What—you scared of a widdle fuzzy badger?
HOLLY
We have… religious differences.
MAGNUS
Did they side with the pixies?
HOLLY
Alba, I can’t go to the Woeful Woods!
ALBA
Magnus will go with you and defend you.
HOLLY
Defend me? Forget badgers—he’s never even seen a tree.
MAGNUS
Can I bring a sword and everything?
EXT. WOODS
SOUND: Birdsong ambience
SOUND: Footsteps
MAGNUS
Let me see the list.
HOLLY
Why do you care? You couldn’t tell a mushroom from a mulberry bush.
MAGNUS
I want to know what plants we’re looking for.
HOLLY
You just stick to navigating, monkey boy.
MAGNUS
Say, why don’t you go fly up over the trees and see if we’re still heading in the right direc—oh, wait, you hurt your wing flying into the pantry door.
HOLLY
Okay, okay, let’s be nice. C’mon, we have to work together.
MAGNUS
So I hear.
HOLLY
(calming herself)
I’m a good fairy and I help people. I’m a good fairy and I help people.
(to Magnus)
What does your map say?
SOUND: Rustling paper
MAGNUS
Uh… we’re getting close to the turning.
MAP
(thin, accented voice)
In. Fifty Paces. Turn: Left. At: Babbling Brook.
HOLLY
Really? I don’t think I trust this GBH thing. Anything made by gnomes…
MAGNUS
It’s GPS.
HOLLY
Whatever.
MAGNUS
It stands for Gnomish Place Seeker.
HOLLY
It’s probably going to lead us into badger territory. Or bears… Hey look! Fairy cake!
MAGNUS
That’s a cake?
SOUND: Crinkling paper
HOLLY
Uh huh! See? It’s a magic cake we fairies make to sustain us on long journeys.
MAGNUS
What’s it doing lying in the grass?
HOLLY
Some nice fairies must have left it here. I wonder if it was anyone I know…
MAGNUS
Or some nice fairies got eaten by a giant spider and all that’s left is their cake.
HOLLY
Want some?
MAGNUS
I’ll pass, thanks.
HOLLY
(eating)
Mmm. You’re missing out.
MAGNUS
How is it magic?
HOLLY
One little piece like this is enough to keep you going all day. Well… that’s how it’s supposed to work. Mine never turns out. I mean, it tastes good but actually it kinda makes you a little bit hungrier…
MAP
In. One Hundred Paces. Turn: Left. At: Babbling Brook.
HOLLY
Okay, maybe a lot hungrier. But it’s sooo good.
MAGNUS
Can you see the brook yet?
MAP
Reckoning…
HOLLY
No. Shouldn’t we have heard it babbling by now?
MAP
Reckoning…
HOLLY
(slowly becoming more spacey)
Hee. “Babble.” What a great word. Babble, babble…
MAGNUS
Are we heading north?
HOLLY
Duh! Look at the moss on the trees.
MAGNUS
Uh… I’m looking. What about it?
HOLLY
The moss grows on the north side. Dummy.
MAGNUS
Is that true or are you just making up more weird fairy stuff? That’s really north?
HOLLY
Absolutely one hundred percent due north.
MAGNUS
Aw, c’mon, I just got this thing! It can’t be broken already.
HOLLY
Oh my gosh! More fairy cake!
(stops and scarfs it down)
Geez, this is my lucky day.
MAGNUS
Holly. How can you just eat random things you find on the ground?
HOLLY
Trust in the forest and it will provide.
MAGNUS
What if it’s poisoned? Or maybe it’s a trap. Left by pixies. Maybe pixies stole the recipe.
HOLLY
Pixies can’t cook.
MAP
In. Thirty. Paces. Turn: Right. At: Great. Granite Mountain.
MAGNUS
Okay, looking for a mountain.
HOLLY
Oh, sure. You don’t believe me about the moss, but you’ll listen to that piece of paper.
MAGNUS
It can’t be wrong. It’s got all the latest data.
HOLLY
Do you see any mountains?
MAGNUS
They could be hidden by the trees.
MAP
Warning. Warning. This map. Has been. Stolen.
HOLLY
You stole the map?
MAGNUS
What? Holly, I’m hurt that you would think such a thing.
MAP
This map. Has been. Stolen.
MAGNUS
Besides, they wanted a hundred and seventy crowns for i! For a piece of junk!
HOLLY
I bet you didn’t pay for that dagger, either.
MAGNUS
Don’t you talk that way about Bloodletter!
HOLLY
Ew.
MAP
This map. Has been. Stolen. And will now. Self-destruct.
SOUND: A bang and a fizzle, like a firecracker
MAGNUS
Ow! Well, that’s just great.
HOLLY
Ha. It serves you righ… Holy calendula! (ca-LEND-you-la) More fairy cake!
MAGNUS
No map, no compass and you can’t even fly.
HOLLY
(stuffing her face)
First of all, we don’t need a compass. Hello! Moss! And second of all…
(trails off)
Gosh, this is awesome cake…
MAGNUS
I bet you’re faking. I bet you can fly just fine.
HOLLY
If I could fly, believe me, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.
MAGNUS
Well, that’s a darn shame for both of us, then.
(beat)
Any other brilliant ideas? Can your special fairy senses detect jimson weed or whatever?
HOLLY
Watch it, buster. And second of all…
(smug)
I do know the way back.
MAGNUS
Oh? How?
HOLLY
I’ve been leaving a trail of markers behind us. That way, we can just retrace our steps.
MAGNUS
Really? That’s… kind of smart, actually. What are you leaving for markers?
HOLLY
That is the amazingly brilliant part. I’ve been leaving pieces of fairy cake. That way, one, I can travel lighter as we go, and two, we have something to eat on the way back!
A long pause.
HOLLY
(worried now)
Oh.
MAGNUS
Great.
HOLLY
Oh. Oh gosh. The cake we found…
MAGNUS
Uh huh.
HOLLY
All this time we must have been…
(trails off)
MAGNUS
Keep going, that was almost a thought there.
HOLLY
(tiny)
Magnus, I think I ate all the cake.
MAGNUS
Good, and?
HOLLY
(getting whinier)
And now I’m hungrier than I was before.
MAGNUS
Shocking.
HOLLY
This is all your fault. This is all your fault! Distracting me with your useless map.
MAGNUS
Oh, it’s my fault you ate all our trail markers.
HOLLY
Yeah? Well, I hope you get lost.
MAGNUS
We’re already lost!
HOLLY
I hope you fall in a hole. And die. And then get eaten alive by bears.
MAGNUS
Why don’t you have some more cake, pixie?
SOUND: Holly flies off, or tries—the buzzing of her wings is erratic and peters out
HOLLY
Have fun getting out of here without a map!
(in the distance)
Ow! Ow!
SOUND: A crash of bushes
INT. PALACE
SOUND: Construction and bustling activity
GUNTHER
There you are, Doctor Krankel.
KRANKEL
Good day, Your Majesty. I’m looking for the Master of Revels.
GUNTHER
You’re out of luck.
KRANKEL
Majesty?
GUNTHER
Parabel had him fired, so everyone’s coming to me for approvals.
KRANKEL
I had thought this was to be a surprise birthday party for Her Majesty?
GUNTHER
It is a surprise party. But she had… strong opinions about the plans.
KRANKEL
Ahh. Well then, Your Majesty will be glad to know the fireworks are all prepared.
GUNTHER
Excellent. The orchestra will be out on the jetty…
KRANKEL
Perfectly suitable. But with respect, Majesty, I had hoped for a more refined musical accompaniment.
GUNTHER
I know. But “Balgomarian Rhapsody” is one of Parabel’s favourites.
KRANKEL
Of course, Majesty.
GUNTHER
Have you found a way to make the banquet appear out of thin air?
KRANKEL
There are several possible approaches, but most efficacious would be to…
ALBA
(approaching)
Gunther.
GUNTHER
Alba, if you don’t mind, the Sorceror General and I are discussing some important business.
KRANKEL
(charming)
Miss Salix. Good day.
ALBA
More important than the health of your citizens?
GUNTHER
Why, what’s the problem?
ALBA
The Bailiff’s men destroyed my garden this morning.
GUNTHER
Your garden?
ALBA
They uprooted my nervous nettles and chopped down the only surviving squid-apple tree this side of the River Twist.
KRANKEL
Oh dear.
GUNTHER
So, surely the order came from the Bailiff’s office.
SOUND: Paper rustles
ALBA
This is Your Majesty’s signature right here on the work order.
GUNTHER
Oh, er… Look, I don’t have time to read every word in every document I sign. Certainly not today.
ALBA
How reassuring.
GUNTHER
Alba, can this please wait until after the party?
KRANKEL
Yes, surely you can use herbs from your existing stores?
ALBA
I have no existing stores!
KRANKEL
How reassuring.
ALBA
They were destroyed by that idiot boy. The one Your Majesty ordered to do his community service for me.
GUNTHER
This is all very unfortunate, but what do you want me to do about it?
KRANKEL
Your Majesty, perhaps the Office of the Sorceror General can be of assistance here?
ALBA
You?
KRANKEL
Miss Salix, I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye…
ALBA
Ha.
KRANKEL
…but as a gesture of goodwill, I’d like to offer you access to our stockpiles.
ALBA
(coldly)
How very kind of you.
KRANKEL
You’re most welcome, Miss Salix. We at the OSG like to be prepared for emergency situations, droughts, shortages…
ALBA
Acts of vandalism…
KRANKEL
…and the like. Just get in touch with my secretary, and she’ll ensure you have everything you need.
GUNTHER
There you go! Problem solved.
ALBA
Yes, very convenient. Perhaps a little too convenient.
KRANKEL
I’m sorry?
ALBA
You had my garden torn out, didn’t you, “Doctor” Krankel? Slipped a little old work order in front of the King, in the midst of all the other party paperwork?
KRANKEL
What possible reason could I have—
ALBA
And how do I know these herbs of yours are safe?
KRANKEL
I really must protest—
GUNTHER
Doctor Krankel has been Sorceror General for twelve years now, and a trusted advisor to both my father and myself—
ALBA
What about those magical listening devices in the council chambers?
KRANKEL
Planted by Meyurian government agents.
ALBA
The suggestibility potion in the Palace drinking water?
KRANKEL
A chance combination of two harmless cooking ingredients.
ALBA
The “accident” aboard HMS Buttercup?
KRANKEL
Was an accident, as you say. Your Majesty, if I may, I must see to the arrival of the pigeon aerobatic team.
GUNTHER
Thank you, Doctor Krankel.
(sighs)
Alba, why can’t you two get along?
ALBA
I’ve told you, he’s been plotting against you for years. And as the only person who seems able to see that, I’m the biggest obstacle to his plans. Which is why he’s trying to show me up by having my garden destroyed.
GUNTHER
No, no, that wasn’t Krankel… I remember now. It was Parabel.
ALBA
What?!
GUNTHER
It was on her giant list of pre-birthday improvements.
ALBA
Parabel wrote this decree?
PARABEL
(approaching)
Did someone call my name?
ALBA
You!
PARABEL
Alba! Which dress should I wear to the party?
ALBA
You had my garden torn out?
GUNTHER
I’ll just be over here.
PARABEL
I know the blue one is more proper, but I still like the red one.
ALBA
Whichever one you like is probably fine, Your Majesty.
PARABEL
Oh, come on, just pick one of them.
ALBA
Fine. The blue one. It’s… more regal, not as showy.
PARABEL
See? That wasn’t so hard. The red one, please, Millie.
ALBA
Parabel? My garden?
PARABEL
Your what? Oh, you mean that underbrush in front of your building?
ALBA
It’s the herb garden for the House of Healing. Was the herb garden.
PARABEL
Oh. Well… it’s not like it was a very nice one.
ALBA
It’s not supposed to be “nice”. It’s supposed to provide vital medicinal ingredients.
PARABEL
You could grow them in little rows, at least. Or arrange them by colour?
ALBA
I give up.
PARABEL
(calling)
Oooh! I know! You should trim all your plants into cute animal shapes!
ALBA
(leaving)
Happy birthday, Your Majesty.
KRANKEL
(to himself)
That went well.
EXT. WOODS
MAGNUS
Hey, there we go, Holly! There’s a sign up ahead.
(no reply)
Holly? Pff, whatever. “Welcome to Badgerton, population 38 badgers, 3 bears.”
BADGER
Why, hello there.
MAGNUS
Whoa!
SOUND: Dagger drawn, clumsily
BADGER
Now, now. I mean you no harm, good sir.
MAGNUS
You shouldn’t sneak up on a guy.
BADGER
You look like a young man on a quest.
MAGNUS
Who wants to know?
BADGER
I am but a simple apothecary.
MAGNUS
You don’t say. And what are you apothecarrying?
BADGER
Why, magical herbs, tree products, mosses, lichens, fungi, maple syrup and souvenir gifts. Badger’s the name, badger’s the species. Proprietor, comma, Badgerton All-Natural Dispensary.
MAGNUS
Really! Now that’s handy.
BADGER
Step right this way.
SOUND: Footsteps—following magnus’s pov
SOUND: Shop door with bell, interior ambiance
MAGNUS
Nice hut.
BADGER
Thank you kindly. I take it by your garb that you are a monk of the Dragon Mountain order.
MAGNUS
Darn straight. Brother Magnus to you.
BADGER
Warriors and healers by trade, unless I’m much mistaken. Seeking rare medicines, perhaps?
MAGNUS
You got it, Badgerino.
BADGER
Excellent. What can I get you?
SOUND: Slip of paper
MAGNUS
Let’s see now… buttery goldenrod?
BADGER
We carry three varieties, all available fresh, dried, powdered, or extract.
MAGNUS
Sweet. How about bladderwort?
BADGER
Dried only, but it’s top quality.
MAGNUS
This is gonna be easier than I thought.
EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS
SOUND: Forest ambiance, slightly creepier
SOUND: Trip and fall, crash of bushes
HOLLY
Oof! Grr! I hate walking! I hate it! And it’s getting darker… Oh gods please don’t let me meet any badgers…
SOUND: Chitinous clicking
SPIDER
Why hello, little fairy.
HOLLY
Gaah! Where did you come from?
SPIDER
Oh, I live here. You look tired—won’t you step into my parlour? For… dinner?
HOLLY
No offense, Mister Spider, but your parlour looks kind of… web-like.
SPIDER
No, no, dear, that’s just decoration. It’s the latest fashion in parlours. Come in, come in!
HOLLY
Mama taught me not to talk to strange eight-foot-tall spiders!
SPIDER
Please! It’s almost time… for dinner.
SOUND: Snatching and clacking of jaws; snapping of twigs
HOLLY
Yeek! Get away!
SOUND: Erratic flying
HOLLY
(receding into the distance)
Ow ow ow!
SPIDER
(forlorn)
No one ever wants to stay… for dinner.
INT. HOUSE CONTINUOUS
SOUND: Crackling fire, soft bubbling
SOUND: From outside, an unsteady buzzing of wings
HOLLY
(approaching at speed)
…aaaaaAAAAA!
SOUND: Glass smash and tinkle, thud and more crashing: cutlery, furniture
HOLLY
Oof! Oof! Ow! Oh, my head… oh, Goddess, I am never gonna eat cake ever again.
(pulls herself up with a groan)
Anybody home? Hello? I’m sorry about your window… Holy Molae, something smells so good.
SOUND: Louder bubbling, pot lid clank
HOLLY
Oh my gosh, porridge. YES. Oh porridge, I love you so much.
(takes a mouthful)
Ow! Ow! Hot!
INT. HUT
MAGNUS
And three pounds of soldierwood bark.
BADGER
Strips or powder?
MAGNUS
It’s all good.
BADGER
I’d recommend the strips, then. You’ll have to grind it yourself, but it’ll keep far longer. Aaand your total comes to… let’s see, three hundred and seventy-nine crowns, five ducats and sixpence.
MAGNUS
Well. You see, I don’t have that kind of cash, I’m afraid…
BADGER
We also take MagisterCard and Farlorian Express.
SOUND: Dagger drawn
MAGNUS
Sorry, Mr. Badger. This is, how you say, a stick-up.
BADGER
Er, I, er, you could always start a tab!
MAGNUS
No no. This is how a stick-up works, you see. You hand over the sack of herbs, and all the cash in the till, or else I stick this dagger up your pointy nose. C’mon. I haven’t got all day.
BADGER
Here.
SOUND: Bag rustles
MAGNUS
And the cash, please. Chop chop.
SOUND: Coins scooped into another bag
BADGER
You bring shame to your order.
MAGNUS
Thank you, good sir. I’ll be sure to tell my friends about your fine establishment. You wouldn’t happen to have a map of the area, would you?
INT. HOUSE
SOUND: Crackling fire, no bubbling
SOUND: Wooden door opens, big footsteps
MAMA
(entering)
So, did you have fun?
BABY
That was the best puppet show ever, Mama! I wanna go again tomorrow!
PAPA
Well, tomorrow it’s a different show for grown-up bears.
BABY
Does it have duels and guys stabbing people and things?
PAPA
No.
MAMA
(simultaneously)
Yes. You’re too young to see it.
BABY
Aww!
PAPA
Wait—something’s wrong.
Hush.
HOLLY
(distant snoring)
BABY
Someone’s broken my chair!
MAMA
Someone’s broken my table!
PAPA
Someone’s broken my front window!
SOUND: Spoon clinks against empty bowl
BABY
Someone’s eaten my porridge.
PAPA
Someone’s eaten MY porridge!
SOUND: Clank of ladle in pot
MAMA
Someone’s eaten the whole pot.
HOLLY
(distantly: snores, giggles in her sleep)
PAPA
What’s that?
BABY
There’s somebody in my room!
MAMA
Junior, fetch me that frying pan. Papa, get your pitchfork.
BABY
Here, Ma.
SOUND: Frying pan clanks
MAMA
We’ve got ourselves an intruder.
EXT. WOODS, NIGHT
SOUND: Big bag rustling, coins jingling
MAGNUS
(to himself; labouring slightly)
Who’s number one? That’s right, Magnus number one, muthagooses.
GUARD
(calling, distant)
Brother Magnus! You are charged with theft. Stand, in the name of the law!
MAGNUS
I scorn your local badger laws! I scoff! Ha ha!
SOUND: Distant bowstring; arrow swoosh and thunk, close by
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Whoa, Nelly. I, uh… vanish into the night!
SOUND: Running footsteps
GUARD
(running)
Stand, robber! Show your hands!
SOUND: Another arrow, further away
SOUND: Running
MAGNUS
(out of breath)
Ha! Lost ’em.
HOLLY
(whispering)
Magnus? Magnus, over here!
MAGNUS
Holly?
HOLLY
Shhh! They’ll hear us!
MAGNUS
Holly, why are you locked in a wooden cage marked “Thife”?
HOLLY
Because bears don’t know how to spell the word “Thief”.
MAGNUS
Huh. Well, at least they spelled the word “Lunch” right.
HOLLY
What?! Is that what that one says?
MAGNUS
Bears, huh? Well, I hope they kill you humanely before they eat you.
HOLLY
What? Magnus, get me out of here!
MAGNUS
You dare ask me to pervert the legal system?
HOLLY
Come on! You know how to melt wood!
MAGNUS
No time, I’m afraid. I’ve gotta deliver my cargo of magic woo woo herbs to the boss.
HOLLY
You found the herbs?
SOUND: Sack rustling
MAGNUS
Every last one on the list. Look! Musk roses, eglantine, and a pound of smug bastardroot.
HOLLY
You cheated. You went to a store.
MAGNUS
I never.
HOLLY
You totally did. I bet you stole it all too!
MAGNUS
Mister Badger let me have it for free! I guess he just liked my face.
SOUND: Arrow swish and thunk
GUARD
(distant)
Brother Magnus! Stand and show yourself!
BADGER
(distant)
That’s the boy! Get him!
SOUND: Running feet approach
MAGNUS
Yikes. I guess that’s my cue.
(heaves his bag back up and starts running off)
So long, bear bait! Ooof!
SOUND: Trip and fall—bag crashes, coins scatter
SOUND: Running footsteps, sword drawn
GUARD
Stay down! Hands on your head! Now!
SOUND: Snapping of manacles
GUARD (CONT’D)
Right. Into the cage with you!
MAGNUS
No way, fur face!
SOUND: Chaos—struggling, crashing, ripping
BADGER
Hold onto him! Keep him still!
MAGNUS
Hey, hey! Hands off, you pervert!
GUARD
Get in the cage! Move!
MAGNUS
Hey! What are you doing? What’s with the leaves?
BADGER
That’s right! Lock him up. We’ll decide what to do with him in the morning.
SOUND: Key in padlock, wooden cage opens and slams, lock clicks
MAGNUS
Hey! Get back here! I demand to speak to my lawyer!
HOLLY
Keep your voice down! You’ll wake the bears. They might decide they want a midnight snack.
MAGNUS
This is just great. Locked in irons and stuck in a cage with a lame fairy, waiting to be eaten by semiliterate bears. And that badger put something down my pants.
HOLLY
I saw. It’s poison ivy.
MAGNUS
That would explain the mild but growing itching sensation.
HOLLY
“Leaves of three, let them be.”
MAGNUS
I’ll be sure to remember that next time I’m being arrested. Aggh, it’s getting worse! This is a travesty of justice!
HOLLY
Well, you did steal all those herbs…
MAGNUS
Oh, don’t you get all high and mighty with me, “Thife”!
HOLLY
That was a misunderstanding!
MAGNUS
Aha.
HOLLY
And besides which, I was starving!
MAGNUS
I wonder why.
HOLLY
I’m not talking to you any more.
MAGNUS
Fine.
Silence.
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Gods it itches!
HOLLY
We really should get out of here.
MAGNUS
Ya think?
HOLLY
Do your wood-melting thing!
MAGNUS
My what?
HOLLY
You said you learned how back at the monastery.
MAGNUS
I was trying to heat up some food and kind of melted the table.
HOLLY
I see. Got any special martial arts moves for breaking out of cages?
MAGNUS
Yeah. But they involve not having my legs in shackles.
HOLLY
Great.
MAGNUS
How about you? Any bright ideas?
HOLLY
Well… I think the lashing on this side is coming apart. I tried budging it earlier but I couldn’t do it by myself. But if we both rock the cage back and forth…
MAGNUS
Hey, yeah. Okay. On three. One, two, three…
SOUND: Slight rhythmic creaking
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
No, no. We need to be in sync.
HOLLY
You’re going to and fro… you should be going fro and to.
MAGNUS
Whatever. One, two, three.
SOUND: Creaking
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
There we go!
HOLLY
Shhh!
MAGNUS
I think it’s working. It’s starting to give a little.
SOUND: Wood snaps
SOUND: Door, far distant
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Almost there…
PAPA
(far distant)
What’s going on out there?
HOLLY
Uh oh, there’s a light! I think someone heard us!
MAGNUS
It’s a bear. It’s three bears.
HOLLY
We’re gonna be a midnight snack!
MAGNUS
Go faster!
SOUND: Cracking and splintering
HOLLY
We did it!
MAGNUS
The door’s off. Quick, quick, make a run for it!
PAPA
(distant)
They’re getting away! Stop them!
MAGNUS
So long, suckers! Oof!
SOUND: Trip and fall
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Holly! Holly, I can’t run in these leg irons!
HOLLY
Well, I can’t carry you!
MAGNUS
Please! Please, Holly, they’re gonna eat me!
HOLLY
Say you’re sorry.
MAGNUS
What?!
HOLLY
Say you’re sorry for stealing those herbs.
MAGNUS
Sorry to who? Badger’s not here.
HOLLY
To the universe.
MAGNUS
Holly…
HOLLY
Say it.
MAGNUS
I am sorry, O Universe. I am so sorry I stole a bunch of herbs from a nice badger who was only trying to make a living.
HOLLY
That’s better.
MAMA
(closing in)
Stop that fairy!
BABY
(closing in)
Porridge stealer!
MAGNUS
Holly!
HOLLY
Hold onto my waist. Oh Mercury, help me…
SOUND: Erratic buzz of wings
HOLLY (CONT’D)
(fading into the distance)
Ow ow ow…
MAGNUS
(simultaneously)
Aaaaaa!
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
SOUND: Door and footsteps. morning birds outside.
HOLLY AND MAGNUS
(suspiciously cheerful)
Morning, Alba!
ALBA
What?
HOLLY
It’s good to see you.
MAGNUS
Yes. Isn’t it a lovely day.
ALBA
I suppose this is bad news.
HOLLY
No, no, we got your herbs and everything. Look!
SOUND: Rustling leaves
ALBA
What’s this supposed to be? Goldenrod?
HOLLY
Uh huh. It’s a… special variety they grow in the swamp.
ALBA
And this?
MAGNUS
That’s ginseng.
ALBA
This is a yam.
MAGNUS
It’s orange ginseng!
HOLLY
Sometimes known as false yam!
MAGNUS
Every herb a modern House of Healing needs.
ALBA
And not, say, a bag of ten random plants you stumbled on in the dark…
(accusing, in turn)
Magnus? Holly?
HOLLY
(beat, then breaks down)
I’m sorry, Alba.
ALBA
(sighs)
Never send a pair of dimwit assistants to do a witch’s job.
HOLLY
I’ll make it up to you. I’ll be your herbalist forever.
ALBA
Please don’t say that.
HOLLY
We need to make amends. What can we do?
MAGNUS
Uh… “we”?
ALBA
Well, there’s a stack of bedpans and chamber pots behind you that need cleaning out. And then you can start rebuilding the pantry.
HOLLY
Yes, Alba.
MAGNUS
Great.
ALBA
Consider yourself lucky. I’m off to Her Majesty’s surprise birthday party.
SOUND: Door slams
MAGNUS
I hate my life.
HOLLY
(beat)
Are you gonna eat that yam?

SOUND: Footsteps and bumping of stretcher
ALBA
(rushed)
Get him up on the table.
PATIENT
(barely awake)
Ughhh….
HOLLY
You’re gonna be okay. Alba’s on the case, and you’re doing great.
SOUND: A thump
ALBA
Magnus, be more careful.
MAGNUS
Well, his head is huge!
ALBA
Holly, hook him up to the monitors, please.
HOLLY
On it.
MAGNUS
What we got, Doc?
ALBA
Patient is male, mid-fifties. Reported a headache this morning, and noticed the swelling later, along with dizziness and blurred vision.
SOUND: A little “tink!” at intevals, like a heartbeat monitor
MAGNUS
Hey, how come you didn’t use the tinky-tinky machine when you were healing me? My injuries were way more life-threatening.
HOLLY
Do we need to anaesthetize?
ALBA
No, but a silence spell would be great about now.
HOLLY
I meant the patient.
ALBA
He was self-medicating with plum brandy all morning.
MAGNUS
That’s what that smell is…
HOLLY
So his head isn’t supposed to be this big?
MAGNUS
What is wrong with him? Is it an abcess?
SOUND: Soft tapping
ALBA
Nope. See that? That’s bone. His actual cranium is enlarged.
SOUND: A scrunching, creaking noise, like something growing
MAGNUS
And getting larger.
HOLLY
Oh, that’s easy! He’s pregnant!
MAGNUS
Uh, humans don’t give birth through their foreheads, Holly.
HOLLY
Well, excuse me.
MAGNUS
See, this is why I have a problem with fairies doing medicine on people.
HOLLY
Fairies are people, monkey boy.
ALBA
Focus, please.
HOLLY
His pulse is strong and fast.
ALBA
So clearly, his humours are out of balance, with an excess of blood in the—
HOLLY
(puzzled)
Actually, the scroll says his humours are fine. Nothing out of balance at all.
ALBA
What? That can’t be right…
MAGNUS
I say we lance the swelling.
HOLLY
You always want to lance things and cut things open.
MAGNUS
Only ’cause it gets results. Once, I treated a guy who had this huge lump on his—
ALBA
(interrupting)
Medicine is detective work. We don’t go in with the scalpels and needles without knowing the root cause.
SOUND: Scrunch
MAGNUS
Boring… Whoa.
ALBA
Still growing.
HOLLY
Ew! That vein in his forehead!
MAGNUS
What happens when it gets too big?
HOLLY
I don’t want to know!
ALBA
It can’t be purple bloat, and it’s the wrong time of year for balloon worms.
MAGNUS
Maybe it’s a curse?
ALBA
Hmm. Good thought. Go and get the Orb of Hydrogenes from my office. (hi-DROD-jen-neez)
MAGNUS
And then can I lance him? Back at the monastery I had to save this monk who got a scratch on his arm from a zombie sloth and it bloated all up like a great big—
ALBA
Get me the Orb, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Fine. Promising young surgeon thwarted yet again.
SOUND: Scrunch
PATIENT
Urgh…
HOLLY
Stay with us. You’re strong and healthy and you’re gonna beat this thing.
ALBA
Holly, I don’t think he even knows what you’re saying.
HOLLY
It’s called an affirmation. It strengthens the spirit.
MAGNUS
Is this the right orb?
ALBA
That’s the one.
SOUND: Magical shimmer
ALBA
Hmm… No sign of malevolent magic.
HOLLY
So what do we do?
ALBA
(beat)
I think we’d better lance the swelling.
MAGNUS
I’ll get the needles.
SOUND: The ominous scrunching, growing sound again
SOUND: Rattle of instruments
PATIENT
Ughhhh…
HOLLY
(to patient)
You’re gonna be all right. You’re hale and hearty, and you’re gonna make it just fine.
MAGNUS
All right, my beauties. Who’s up for a little trip to the centre of the brain? Ten gauge? Eight gauge? Perhaps the one I like to call Ye Old Apple Corer?
ALBA
Standard gauge, number Four B.
MAGNUS
Your wish is my command. 70
ALBA
A little higher up, that’s it. Just behind the ear.
SOUND: A tiny, squishy noise, followed by a splatter of fluids
MAGNUS
Yeaaaaah.
HOLLY
Eww!
MAGNUS
Holly, if you can’t take the goo, get out of the operating room.
HOLLY
It’s glowing!
ALBA
Now that’s even stranger. Why is the cerebral fluid glowing?
MAGNUS
Dunno, but at least it should take the pressure off, shouldn’t it?
SOUND: The scrunching noise intensifies to dangerous levels, and the ongoing “tink tink” is quite RAPID NOW
ALBA
Or maybe not.
MAGNUS
Should I poke him again?
HOLLY
Oh gods!
ALBA
Get down!
SOUND: A messy, splattery explosion
MAGNUS AND HOLLY
(yell)
SOUND: Eerie silence—the “tink” noise has stopped. just the occasional drip
MAGNUS
Did you see that? That was awesome.
(beat)
But, you know, in a really bad way.
MUSIC: OPENING THEME
HERALD
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Fourth: A Chance to Cure.
INT. RECEPTION
ALBA
I’m so very sorry, Mrs Strudebaker.
MRS S.
Thank you, Miss Salix. I’m sure you did everything you could.
ALBA
It was quick. And I’m quite certain he didn’t feel any pain.
MRS S.
The way he drank, he seldom did. Oh, Arthur. Poor, silly Arthur. I just knew he’d meet a bad end some day… Would it be all right if I see him?
ALBA
Not just yet.
SOUND: Interior door and clanking of buckets
MAGNUS
(passing through)
Good morning. Don’t mind me…
MRS S.
What’s in those buckets?
MAGNUS
Nothing! Nothing to see…
ALBA
(sotto voce)
Magnus, I told you to use the other door.
MRS S.
That sound earlier… He didn’t—Arthur didn’t explode, did he?
ALBA
Well, in a manner of speaking…
MRS S.
It would be just like him, you know.
SOUND: Exterior door
GERRARD
(entering)
Help! This is an emergency!
MAGNUS
Whoa, check him out.
ALBA
Oh dear, not another one.
GERRARD
Are you the Royal Physician?
ALBA
That’s me.
GERRARD
My head is swelling. I need medical attention!
ALBA
All right, hold on to your hat. Sorry.
MRS S.
Is it an outbreak? Are we all going to explode?
GERRARD
Who’s exploded?
MRS S.
My husband!
GERRARD
Is this true? People have actually exploded?
ALBA
Well…
MAGNUS
Maybe.
ALBA
One.
MAGNUS
A little bit.
ALBA
We’re working to ascertain the cause.
GERRARD
I demand to be treated this instant!
ALBA
Please stay calm, Sir.
GERRARD
Do you know who I am?
ALBA
Yes, you’re that real estate man on all the signs around town.
GERRARD
Carlton Gerrard, property developer. I own this town. And you’d better have a cure for this, this… whatever it is!
ALBA
Yes, yes, come this way. Magnus—
MAGNUS
Standard gauge Four B?
ALBA
No. You stay here and… see to Mrs Strudebaker.
MAGNUS
Three B?
SOUND: Door slams
MAGNUS
Dangit.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
SOUND: Bubbling and stirring, plus the tink! noise again
GERRARD
So you have no idea what’s wrong with me.
ALBA
We’re working on it. Now, if you’d be so kind—
GERRARD
I need answers!
ALBA
Have you been drinking, Mr Gerrard?
GERRARD
Never touch the stuff. A man’s body is a temple. If I poisoned my mind with alcohol, I’d never have gotten this far—
ALBA
Just ruling out some possible factors. Any recent illnesses?
GERRARD
None. I’m healthy as a horse. Haven’t missed a day of work in twenty-six years. And that includes weekends.
HOLLY
(hushed)
Alba, I’ve gone through the books… the symptoms are all wrong for brain galls.
ALBA
(hushed)
Damn.
HOLLY
But then I thought, what about a shrinking spell?
ALBA
Then he’d have a tiny head that’s still about to explode.
GERRARD
What are you two muttering about? Get on with it!
HOLLY
It’s okay, Mr Gerrard! You’re healthy as a horse! You can beat this thing!
ALBA
You had to say it, didn’t you?
INT. RECEPTION
MRS S.
It’s a shame, really. We never saw enough of each other.
MAGNUS
Yeah, you mentioned.
MRS S.
It was the show business, you see. He was always on the road.
MAGNUS
Uh huh.
MRS S.
“Strudebaker the Magnificent”. The best stage magician who ever lived. Dazzlioni, Bagatelle… All those younger so-called illusionists, they stole every trick they know from my Arthur.
MAGNUS
But he didn’t do any real magic.
MRS S.
Oh, he dabbled a bit. And once he started losing his audience to those young upstarts, Arthur started hawking crystals and whatnot to make ends meet. Not that that ever worked.
MAGNUS
Wait a second. You said he was travelling?
MRS S.
Yes, he was just back from touring the west coast, down through Mediocria and the Pointy Lands. He caught some tropical disease out there, I just know it.
MAGNUS
You think?
MRS S.
I always warned him, don’t drink the water, and certainly don’t eat the food—that’s just asking for trouble.
MAGNUS
Sounds like a recipe for health.
MRS S.
But did he listen? Of course not. Always travelling, to all parts. Farloria, Balgomar, Eastrise… He went all over the place.
ALBA AND HOLLY
(both yell, off mic)
SOUND: A messy explosion in the other room
MAGNUS
Tell me about it.
MRS S.
And now he’s gone and exploded.
MAGNUS
Yeah. Listen, I gotta get back in the operating room.
(leaving)
We’ll have the undertaker call by your place, okay?
INT. OPERATING ROOM
SOUND: Dripping
HOLLY
(shellshocked)
I don’t understand it. We gave them pinchweed, elm bark…
ALBA
None of the incantations seemed to do anything.
SOUND: Door opens
MAGNUS
Another one blew and I missed it?
ALBA
Grab a mop.
MAGNUS
Yes ma’am.
ALBA
This is awful. Two patients lost in one day. And high profile patients at that.
MAGNUS
That’s a heck of a splatter radius. We should really put up some curtains or something.
HOLLY
Urghh…
SOUND: Mopping up
ALBA
But why these two? What did they have in common besides the symptoms?
HOLLY
Both male, both human…
MAGNUS
Both old, and kinda full of themselves.
HOLLY
You don’t know that.
MAGNUS
Hey, that’s what Mrs Strudebaker said. But more importantly, she says he probably picked up some tropical disease on tour.
ALBA
Really! Now that is interesting.
MAGNUS
See? Detective work.
ALBA
But how would Gerrard have caught it? He hasn’t left town in years.
HOLLY
Maybe he went to a magic show?
ALBA
Wait a second. What was that first thing you said, Magnus?
MAGNUS
Strudebaker was on tour in Melluria…
ALBA
No, about both patients being full of themselves. What if… what if that fluid in their brains was actually ego?
MAGNUS
You mean their heads got too big? Literally?
HOLLY
Oh no. That means…
ALBA
The egotistic fluid!
MAGNUS
The what?
ALBA
It’s only been a theory until now. This could be the first time it’s been isolated.
HOLLY
Oh my gosh it’s my fault. It’s all my fault.
ALBA
What is?
HOLLY
My affirmations. I told them both they were strong and they could fight it off. Oh gods, I fed their egos and now they’re both…
ALBA
I don’t think it was you, Holly.
HOLLY
(in tears)
I’m a bad fairy!
ALBA
Something out there is causing people’s brains to overproduce egotistic fluid. People with over-inflated egos will be the most susceptible.
SOUND: Desk bell, from the other room
HOLLY
Oh gods, it’s another one!
ALBA
We don’t know that yet.
(calling)
Be right with you!
PAGE
(at the door)
Forgive me, Miss Salix, but this is a dire emergency.
ALBA
Let me guess. Who’s sick?
PAGE
Her Majesty the Queen.
ALBA
Oh no. If anyone’s got an excess of egotistic fluid, it’s Parabel.
INT. PALACE
GUARD
State your business.
ALBA
Royal Physician and her assistant to see Queen Parabel.
GUARD
Carry on.
SOUND: Gate opens; their voices and footsteps echo
HOLLY
(hushed)
I killed them, Alba!
ALBA
Nonsense. How were you to know?
HOLLY
I’ve killed two of your patients, oh, Alba… I don’t want to be a bad fairy.
ALBA
Well, help me with this, then. The salve you brought should induce melancholy, and on top of that we’ll both work on deflating her ego.
HOLLY
Both of us?
ALBA
We have to. It was always “me, me, me” when we were growing up… now she’s Queen she’s completely out of control. You should have seen her birthday party.
HOLLY
I saw the fireworks in the shape of her face.
ALBA
That’s Parabel for you. At dinner she had to have a different dress for every course.
HOLLY
I still don’t think I can be mean to her.
ALBA
Just keep your affirmations to yourself and leave the rest to me.
HOLLY
Okay.
ALBA
And don’t let on about the other cases. Don’t want to get her blood pressure up.
SOUND: Door opens; no more reverb
GUNTHER
Alba, thank goodness you’re here.
PARABEL
Alba! You have to help me…
ALBA
Your Majesties. Oh, Parabel, for heaven’s sake, what have you done now?
PARABEL
Me? Me?!
ALBA
See what I mean?
PARABEL
So much for bedside manner.
ALBA
Holly, she’s got the same symptoms. Cranium is enlarged, warm to the touch…
HOLLY
Okay. I’ll have the unguent ready in a sec.
GUNTHER
The same symptoms? There are other cases?
ALBA
(realizing her slip)
Yes. Two so far.
PARABEL
Oh, my head…
GUNTHER
There, there, dear. You’re in good hands. You can overcome this—whatever it is.
PARABEL
And I’m too young and beautiful to die.
GUNTHER
That goes without saying.
PARABEL
Oh, honey duckling…
HOLLY
(sotto voce)
Alba…
ALBA
Your Majesty, we’re going to have to be alone with the patient.
GUNTHER
But Parabel is in a weakened state…
PARABEL
And my Gunther gives me strength to carry on.
ALBA
Sorry, but no. Your Majesty, I have to insist.
GUNTHER
Very well. Courage, dear.
PARABEL
Oh, darling, I miss you already…
GUNTHER
Be strong, my treasure.
ALBA
Out!
SOUND: Door closes
PARABEL
Alba, why do you always have to ruin things?
ALBA
It’s my job. Hold still.
PARABEL
Oh, it’s too awful. Don’t look! Stop looking at me!
ALBA
How am I supposed to cure you if I can’t look at you, you stupid girl?
PARABEL
You see? You always treat me like I’m still your baby sister.
ALBA
Well, if the slipper fits…
PARABEL
I’m Queen now, and you’re not. And you should show some respect. Isn’t that right, fairy?
HOLLY
I wouldn’t know. I don’t get involved in human affairs.
PARABEL
Where did you find her? Are you sure she’s a good fairy?
HOLLY
Okay, I have to apply this to your forehead now… hold still for me, Your Majesty.
(whispering, to Alba)
Can I still call her Your Majesty?
ALBA
It’s fine.
INT. RECEPTION
SOUND: Quiet squishing and scraping
MAGNUS
(to himself, as he works)
The upper jaw connected to the cheek bone. Cheek bone connected to the temporal bone. The temporal bone connected to the… Wait. No, you’re part of Gerrard’s skull, you should be in that pile. Temporal bone connected to… c’mon, where is it…
SOUND: Door opens
GUY
(bursting in)
A surgeon! Ho! A surgeon!
MAGNUS
(startled)
Alba’s not here right now… can I help you?
GUY
I need medical attention, on the instant!
MAGNUS
Everyone’s so demanding today.
GUY
I have been wounded in a duel. Pierced here and here with a poisoned blade.
MAGNUS
That looks pretty deep.
GUY
Are you a surgeon?
MAGNUS
Well, I… yes! Yes, I am the House of Healing’s resident surgeon. So… poisoned, huh?
GUY
Indeed.
MAGNUS
Well, I’m okay with the surgery, but poisons aren’t really my department—
SOUND: Shink! of a sword being drawn
GUY
Forbidden to heal a known outlaw, are you? Don’t worry. I won’t tell. And neither will you. How’s that for fair?
MAGNUS
I’ve got a better idea. Hyah!
SOUND: Flurry of limbs. sword clatters to the floor, then picked up
GUY
Oho! Clever move, monk.
MAGNUS
Nice sword. I like the weight.
SOUND: He gives the sword an experimental swing or two
GUY
Yes, isn’t it nice? That’s why I always carry a spare.
SOUND: Shink!
MAGNUS
Well, aren’t you a tactical genius.
GUY
I hate to boast, but yes.
SOUND: Swords clash
MAGNUS
I trained in the Monastery of Dragon Mountain, for your information.
GUY
I’d guessed by the robes. But by the way you fight, I surmise you didn’t actually train for very long, did you?
MAGNUS
That’s a special technique to keep you off your guard. Haaa!
GUY
Really! I thought it was to get me to take pity on you.
SOUND: They fight, blades whirling and furnishings smashing, until…
SOUND: A wire whips through the air
MAGNUS
Glrk!
GUY
Drop the sword, little brother.
MAGNUS
(strangling)
Okay.
SOUND: Sword drops to the floor
GUY
Guy Van Fleet is the name. I’ve killed two men today, so I have a few to go to keep up my average.
MAGNUS
(awestruck)
You’re Guy Van Fleet? The highwayman?
GUY
No, Guy Van Fleet the scullery maid. You, young sirrah, will find me a remedy for this poison, and bind the wounds. Yes?
MAGNUS
That sounds like a good deal.
GUY
Now, as a little incentive, I should warn you that the wire around your neck is enchanted. I call it a dead man’s garrotte. If you’re wearing it and, let’s say, something happens and I die…
MAGNUS
(as the garrotte tightens)
Hurk!
GUY
…there goes your head.
MAGNUS
Uhhh…!
GUY
Now, let’s see about this poison, shall we?
MAGNUS
The pantry’s this way.
GUY
Good. And remember. I die…
MAGNUS
Hlgk!
GUY
…you die.
MAGNUS
Ingenious!
INT. PALACE
SOUND: Dabbing and squishing
ALBA
Any change?
HOLLY
No… I tripled the strength of the salve, but it’s still not doing anything.
SOUND: Scrunching noise
PARABEL
I knew I should have summoned Krankel sooner.
ALBA
That horrid little phony?
PARABEL
Why did we ever make you Royal Physician?
ALBA
Oh, I don’t know—for saving your life and Gunther’s?
PARABEL
And now I’m about to die because of you!
ALBA
It’s not my fault your head is swollen!
PARABEL
Oh? Whose fault is it?
HOLLY
It’s yours.
PARABEL
(speechless for a moment)
Well, I never!
HOLLY
(steeling herself)
It’s true. You’ve brought this on yourself.
PARABEL
How dare you address me like that. I’m your Queen.
HOLLY
See! And that’s the problem! You’ve let it go to your head.
PARABEL
Just who do you think you are?
HOLLY
I’m… I’m a good fairy who knows what’s best for you… Your Majesty.
PARABEL
It’s bad enough I have to listen to my domineering older sister.
ALBA
When have you ever listened to anything I’ve told you?
PARABEL
You don’t even have any natural talent.
ALBA
Unlike you, of course.
PARABEL
One happens to be the third daughter of a third daughter.
HOLLY
Well, why aren’t you out healing people, then?
ALBA
Good one.
PARABEL
Because I’m Queen, and I have more important duties!
ALBA
Such as?
PARABEL
Such as ruling, and representing Farloria to the world, and inspecting the Royal Constabulary…
HOLLY
But anyone could do that.
PARABEL
I’ve had enough of your impertinence, fairy.
(calling)
Guards!
HOLLY
(cracking)
I’m only saying it because otherwise you’re going to die, just like the others!
PARABEL
(stunned, then)
Die? People have been dying?
ALBA
So much for keeping that under wraps.
HOLLY
I’m sorry, but yes. We had two other cases like this today and they both…
PARABEL
What?
ALBA
Had complications.
HOLLY
(simultaneously)
Exploded.
PARABEL
And you couldn’t save them?
ALBA
If we’d saved them, they wouldn’t have… had complications.
PARABEL
Oh, gods, I’m too young to explode!
HOLLY
There’s no such thing. You… You’re not strong enough and you can’t possibly fight this!
PARABEL
Where’s Krankel? Summon the Sorceror General!
INT. OPERATING ROOM
GUY
Aaaaarghh!
MAGNUS
Seriously, I can give you a local if you want.
GUY
I prefer the pain. It’s good for you. Makes you feel alive.
MAGNUS
How’s the numbness?
GUY
Completely gone.
MAGNUS
That’s good then. The antidote’s working.
(to himself)
Thank the gods.
GUY
Arghh!
MAGNUS
So, close call, huh?
GUY
Hardly. I’ve survived far worse than this. When I broke into Castle Coconella, I slew twelve of the Duke’s elite guards with nothing but a lead pipe, and that with my hands tied behind my back.
MAGNUS
You’re kidding.
GUY
All in a day’s work for the kingdom’s most feared outlaw.
MAGNUS
Say, you haven’t felt any swelling in the, uh, head region, have you?
GUY
No… why do you ask?
MAGNUS
Just making sure it’s not.. something else. Okay, that’s the right side done. Turn this way and I’ll get that other wound allll sewed up.
GUY
It’s “sewn”.
MAGNUS
Yeah, I was just being, you know, colloquial. You know how we hardened criminals are.
GUY
Of course.
MAGNUS
So I was just thinking, if you ever need more help, you know, in future, with break-ins or hold-ups or anything, ’cause I trained at the Monastery of Dragon Mountain where I learned to fight plus a lot of other useful skills such as sewing up stab wounds and splinting broken limbs and I’m also pretty good at mopping floors and… oh and I broke out of prison once! Well okay, a cage, anyway, I haven’t actually killed anyone before although I’m working my way up to it, I mean, I came pretty close this one time but yeah maybe it’s best to leave that kind of stuff to you since you’re the… expert…
A long pause.
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
I’ll just get you stitched up now.
GUY
Yes, that would be best.
INT. BEDROOM
SOUND: Door opens
HERALD
(entering)
The Sorceror General to see you, Majesty!
KRANKEL
Your Majesty.
PARABEL
Oh, Mister Krankel—!
KRANKEL
Doctor Krankel.
PARABEL
Thank heavens you’re here. Alba says I’m dying.
KRANKEL
Indeed. I came as soon as I could. Excuse me, ladies.
ALBA
Not at all.
KRANKEL
Good heavens. This is quite worrying.
PARABEL
(frightened)
Ohh!
KRANKEL
If your Majesty would be so kind as to hold this cup while I fill it with thrice-distilled spirit of amber.
SOUND: Clasps on a bag being opened
SOUND: Flask opened and poured into a metal cup
ALBA
And what is this meant to achieve?
KRANKEL
A proper diagnosis. Observe the ripples on the surface of the liquid. Yes, it appears Your Majesty’s physical form has been distorted by mystical means.
ALBA
We’ve already tested for curses.
KRANKEL
Not necessarily a curse—possibly an accident. Let me see, now…
INT. OPERATING ROOM
GUY
Nnghhh!
MAGNUS
There we go. Just gotta tie that off…
SOUND: Snip of scissors; needle dropped into a tray
MAGNUS
And we’re done.
GUY
Good work, Brother Magnus.
MAGNUS
Hey, any time.
GUY
You may be young, but you could be quite a fine surgeon.
MAGNUS
Well, you know, I—gurk!
GUY
Which is why it’s a shame I have to kill you.
INT. PALACE
KRANKEL
See how the ripples cross now—the sign for water.
PARABEL
I must be taking on too much water!
HOLLY
That’s not what it means! Your Majesty.
KRANKEL
Hmm. Water can also refer to reflection or refraction…
PARABEL
Like a mirror?
KRANKEL
Quite. Has Your Majesty seen anything unusual in a mirror today?
PARABEL
In a mirror…
ALBA
Or glass or a crystal?
PARABEL
(suddenly guilty)
A crystal?
HOLLY
Like this crystal?
PARABEL
Oh, that silly old thing.
KRANKEL
A Prystorchion crystal! How did Your Majesty come to possess such an item?
PARABEL
It was a gift!
KRANKEL
Let me see. Yes, an impure specimen. Very dangerous. Your Majesty wasn’t attempting to work magic with this, I hope?
PARABEL
No, no, of course not.
ALBA
Then how do you explain this little pamphlet on “Your Crystal Clear Path To Prosperity”?
PARABEL
I have no idea where that came from.
HOLLY
Yeah right!
ALBA
(surprised)
Holly!
HOLLY
I can’t stop it, Alba! All these mean words are coming out by themselves now.
PARABEL
I found out how much my birthday party cost and I just felt so guilty… I didn’t want the kingdom to go broke on my account.
ALBA
Where did you get the crystal, Parabel?
PARABEL
I bought it from that traveling magician, Strudebaker.
ALBA
Aha!
PARABEL
I did the ritual from the pamphlet and I saw myself reflected in the crystal, with my head all bulging… I looked hideous!
HOLLY
Not much of a change, then!
ALBA
That’s enough, Holly.
KRANKEL
As I thought—just look at that curvature.
PARABEL
Well, yes, but… Doctor Krankel, this is hardly the time!
KRANKEL
Definitely flawed. Typically one would use it in a spell to attract certain energetic patterns such as money… but an impure crystal can cause feedback, distorting the mental anchor, specifically the spell-caster’s own head.
PARABEL
Am I going to die?
KRANKEL
By no means, Your Majesty. Now that we know the mechanism behind your malady, breaking the spell is as simple as—
SOUND: Crystal smashes, followed by the sound of the magic spell dissipating
SOUND: The scrunching noise
PARABEL AND HOLLY
(gasp)
KRANKEL
—breaking the crystal.
ALBA
Why didn’t I think of that?
KRANKEL
Well, not everyone can be an expert on magical healing.
HOLLY
You lay off Alba, you smug bully!
KRANKEL
Miss Salix, you ought to curb your fairy minion.
HOLLY
Minion? You’re a minion!
INT. OPERATING ROOM
MAGNUS
(choking)
Gack! No, you don’t have to do kill me! I won’t tell, honest…
GUY
I’m a wanted man, you see. I rode seven miles out of my way to avoid being followed here. I won’t be caught because some foolish boy couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
MAGNUS
I won’t tell. I won’t tell anyone.
(the noose tightens)
Honest! If I tell anyone you can kill me, but I won’t, I really won’t! And hey, if you ever need healing after a big job goes down, I’m your guy… Guy.
Pause.
GUY
That’s not a bad point, you know.
MAGNUS
Free of charge!
GUY
Very well, then. Just remember—I have eyes and ears everywhere.
MAGNUS
Gurk!
GUY
And if you breathe a word to anyone about this, you can bet that what’s left of your miserable life will make the fires of Hell look like a vacation on the Meyurian Riviera.
MAGNUS
Absolutely! Fires of Hell!
SOUND: Wire whips through the air as it’s retracted
MAGNUS
(gasping)
Oh thank the gods.
GUY
Farewell, and remember…
MAGNUS
Not a word!
SOUND: Door opens and shuts
GUY

Hiyo Arsenic, away!
SOUND: His horse whinnies and breaks into a gallop, fading
MAGNUS
Thanks Guy!
(sighs)
You’re the best!
INT. PALACE
PARABEL
Oh… oh dear, it aches…
KRANKEL
You see? Your Majesty is already returning to a normal, healthy tiara size.
ALBA
When are you going to learn not to meddle with things you don’t understand?
KRANKEL
With respect, Majesty, I must concur with your sister. These magics are not to be trifled with—
PARABEL
I’m a third daughter of a third daughter! I have the gift!
ALBA
Of stupidity, clearly!
HOLLY
Clearly.
PARABEL
The Royal Physician and her assistant are dismissed.
KRANKEL
Good day to you, Miss Salix.
ALBA
Shove it, wizard.
HOLLY
Minion.
KRANKEL
Majesty, if I may—
PARABEL
You too! All of you! Get out of my INT. bedroom!
KRANKEL
Yes, Majesty.
HOLLY
And Your Majesty’s head is still too big!
SOUND: Door slams
EXT. ROAD—SOON AFTER
SOUND: Daytime birds and insects
ALBA
We’ll have to put out a public health bulletin—there may be more crystals out there.
HOLLY
Do you think Mr Gerrard had one too?
ALBA
I’d heard he was in bad shape financially. He was trying to build a new planned borough on the edge of town but it fizzled. He must have turned to magic to get himself out of debt.
HOLLY
So it had nothing to do with their egos at all.
ALBA
Not directly.
HOLLY
So we were just insulting the Queen for nothing.
ALBA
That was satisfying, at least.
HOLLY
(sighs)
I’m such a bad fairy.
ALBA
Nonsense. Have your wings and skin turned grey?
HOLLY
Um… no, not yet.
ALBA
Teeth?
HOLLY
(she checks)
Still not pointed.
ALBA
I think you’ll be fine.
HOLLY
I still have some good deeds to perform for you. Though I understand if you don’t want me to…
ALBA
Well… to tell the truth, you’ve been a lot of help.
HOLLY
Really?
ALBA
Verging on useful.
HOLLY
Aww. Thank you, Alba!
ALBA
Don’t mention it.
HOLLY
We’re like a team now!
ALBA
Maybe I can still get Parabel to fire me.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
MAGNUS
Brother Magnus, chief surgeon and special assistant to Mister Guy Van Fleet. Heh.

Whuppa-whup-whup! This is a dead man’s garrotte. One move and kchrkk!

HOLLY

The team! The team that cares! The team that heals! Together!
MAGNUS
Oh, hey, guys.
ALBA
Magnus, I thought I told you to clean up around here.
MAGNUS
I was just getting to that.
ALBA
Have you called the undertaker?
MAGNUS
In fact, that’s the very next thing on my list.
ALBA
All the instruments are just lying out. And what happened to the chairs in here?
HOLLY
Are those sword marks?
MAGNUS
Uh…
ALBA
Honestly, Magnus, what have you been doing for the past two hours?
MAGNUS
I’ve been busy…
ALBA
What, having a duel on top of the reception desk?
HOLLY
Ha! And then stitching up the other guy afterward?
MAGNUS
Maybe I was. You don’t know.
ALBA
Is that what happened?
MAGNUS
…no, of course not. Ha. That would be ridiculous.
ALBA
Well, get back to work. This place is a disaster.
HOLLY
Kinda like you! Sorry! Sorry!
SOUND: Interior door slams
INT. OFFICE
PARABEL
I came to apologize for throwing you out. I called you terrible names and behaved like a spoilt child after you’d just saved my life. And I shouldn’t have been meddling with magic, of course, although I was only trying to help our kingdom.
KRANKEL
Your Majesty, there is no need to apologize. It was a stressful situation.
PARABEL
But you were right, of course. It was foolish of me to try to practice without the proper study and understanding.
KRANKEL
And is that perhaps the other reason for Your Majesty’s visit?
PARABEL
What do you mean, Doctor Krankel?
KRANKEL
Do I gather that Your Majesty seeks to… develop her inborn gifts?
PARABEL
Gifts? Oh, you mean that nonsense about being the third daughter of a third daughter.
KRANKEL
It would be a pleasure to help shape such a prodigious natural talent as your Majesty’s.
PARABEL
It’s nothing, really.
KRANKEL
But if I may—why not go to your sister instead?
PARABEL
Do you really think she’d teach me? She doesn’t trust anyone, least of all her little sister. Do you know she says you’re plotting to take over the kingdom?
KRANKEL
How very amusing, Majesty. Probably best not to tell her about this, then.
PARABEL
Oh, gods, of course not. Alba can get stuffed.
KRANKEL
Indeed. Shall we begin?

Hello Alba. I came to ask: my neighbour has been taking a potion for his lumbago, and I was wondering if you stock it?
ALBA
What kind of potion?
SCHPRINGELER
I believe it’s called Frinozipax.
ALBA
(suddenly chilly)
We don’t stock it.
SCHPRINGELER
I’m told the results it provides are quite astounding.
ALBA
Last visit, I gave you a herbal tea and some exercises.
SCHPRINGELER
Why, yes…
ALBA
And how are those going?
SCHPRINGELER
I haven’t really had time…
ALBA
You people! Everybody just wants a pill or a potion or some other easy way out. Try eating better! Get outside a little. Don’t drink so much mead.
SCHPRINGELER
I’ll do my best. So, do you think you’ll carry Frinozipax any time soon?
ALBA
I don’t care if it cures leprosy and straightens out crossed eyes. We don’t carry it.
SCHPRINGELER
All right then.
ALBA
Honestly, if I ever get my hands on whoever is shilling this stuff…
WITHROW
Alba?
ALBA
Yes?
WITHROW
It is you!
MAGNUS
Who?
WITHROW
Alba, you’re looking fantastic.
ALBA
Withrow Lee? What are you doing in Grandville?
WITHROW
Oh, I’m just in town for a conference. Who’s this kid and why is he dressed like a monk?
ALBA
My apprentice Magnus. He used to be with the Dragon Mountain order.
MAGNUS
Hey, hey, no “used to be”.
ALBA
Magnus, this is Withrow. He’s a… an old friend.
WITHROW
Oh, “friend”, is it?
ALBA
Well, all right, we were more than that.
WITHROW
Boy, were we!
MAGNUS
Okay, say no more.
WITHROW
Back in the day, we were the Diabolical Duo… the Paranormal Pair—
MAGNUS
Let me guess, you met making stone tools down by the watering hole?
WITHROW
Oh, a wise guy, huh? We met at Hazelbrooke.
MAGNUS
You went to witch school?
WITHROW
Darn tootin’.
MAGNUS
Did you learn any cool dark magic?
WITHROW
Oh, I could tell you some stories—
ALBA
Dark magic was strictly forbidden.
MAGNUS
In other words, your school was lame.
ALBA
It was not lame.
WITHROW
Says the girl who dropped out to protest the curriculum.
(to Magnus)
She turned the Headmistress’s chair into a beanbag before storming out.
MAGNUS
A beanbag?
WITHROW
Full of carnivorous Mellurian jumping beans.
MAGNUS
Okay, that’s pretty good. See, why can’t you teach me stuff like that, Alba?
ALBA
You have to ask? Well, it’s been nice to see you, Withrow—
PATIENT
Excuse me. Miss Salix?
ALBA
Yes? How can I help you?
PATIENT
Do you carry Frinozipax?
WITHROW
Frinozipax? Funny you should ask—
ALBA
No, we don’t. It’s useless pap for useless people. Go away.
PATIENT
Oh. Thanks anyway.
WITHROW
Softhearted as ever, I see.
ALBA
Fifty crowns says it’s just elderflowers and molasses. But that’s the power of suggestion for you.
MAGNUS
Whoever’s selling it, I bet they’re making a killing.
ALBA
And if I ever find out who they are, I’m going to stuff them headfirst into a pill bottle.
WITHROW
(changing the subject)
So, Royal Physician, eh? Not too shabby…
ALBA
Oh, yes. It’s great fun running the neighbourhood clinic and the national health policy office, on top of tending to whichever Royal Majesty stubs their little toe. And here I am on my supposed day off, running a booth at the market. And I have to file a report with the Chancellor tomorrow about the state of local witch-run clinics in the countryside.
WITHROW
That’s my Alba, always the overachiever. Why don’t you take a break?
ALBA
Don’t I wish.
MAGNUS
I can take care of the booth.
ALBA
You?
WITHROW
C’mon, Alba! Get some fresh air. It’s market day!
ALBA
Oh… all right. Magnus, take over for me. And no skipping off this time.
MAGNUS
You can count on me.
MUSIC: OPENING THEME
HERALD
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Fifth: To Market, To Market.
EXT. MARKET
SOUND: Lively crowd
WITHROW
I always love the market. The food, the hustle and bustle…
ALBA
The easy marks?
WITHROW
Hey, now, my business these days is strictly above board.
ALBA
I see.
VENDOR
(distant)
Candy apples, three pennies each! Two for fivepence!
WITHROW
Hey, you want a candy apple? They were always your favourite.
ALBA
I don’t like that woman. She lives with her father and treats him like garbage.
WITHROW
Just this once. Here.
VENDOR
Candy apples!
WITHROW
We’ll take two.
VENDOR
Certainly, sir.
WITHROW
Thanks. Here you go, Alba.
VENDOR
That’ll be five pennies, please.
WITHROW
Can you break a sovereign?
VENDOR
Not a problem. You want it in shillings?
SOUND: Jingling coins
WITHROW
That’d be great. Actually, hang on. Give me four shillings and… no, wait, make that three shillings and twelve ducats.
VENDOR
(confused)
Twelve?
WITHROW
Oh, silly me. I can’t do math. Twelve plus thirty-three and one is eight… so why don’t I give you back one and you give me five ducats, three groats and a crown?
VENDOR
Uh… of course.
WITHROW
Keep the change.
VENDOR
Really? Thank you, sir.
WITHROW
Have a lovely day.
VENDOR
And the same to you and the lady.
WITHROW
(to Alba)
There you go.
ALBA
(amused)
Strictly above board, eh?
WITHROW
She won’t figure that out for hours. Maybe never.
ALBA
You really haven’t changed, have you?
WITHROW
Did you miss me?
ALBA
Not in the least.
WITHROW
Yeah, you did.
ALBA
Eat your apple, you.
EXT. MARKET BOOTH
HOLLY
(arriving)
Hi, sorry I’m late! Hey Magnus, where’s Alba?
MAGNUS
She went off with her old boyfriend. And when I say old…
HOLLY
Aww, she has a boyfriend? Is he nice?
MAGNUS
Say, Holly… have you heard of this new potion, Frinozipax?
HOLLY
Yeah, everyone’s asking about it lately. I think it’s a scam.
MAGNUS
It totally is. We should sell something like that.
HOLLY
You are not selling placebos!
MAGNUS
Okay, we can throw in some ingredients or whatever. How about this stuff?
SOUND: Bottle clinks
HOLLY
No! I told you, we’re almost out of sludgewort.
MAGNUS
So don’t use so much per dose. Spread it around. If we could crank it out in big batches, we’d sell hundreds of bottles. Thousands!
HOLLY
That’s not how the House of Healing works!
MAGNUS
Which is why we’ve been missing the boat. Look, I’ll just use a tiny drop.
SOUND: Bottle corked and shaken
JEROME.
(stuffy nose)
Hey there, Holly. Hi Magnus.
HOLLY
Hello, Jerome!
JEROME
Is Alba around? I need something for the shrew flu.
MAGNUS
Why, if it’s the shrew flu you’ve got, sludgewort is the best relief.
JEROME
This doesn’t look like sludgewort extract…
MAGNUS
(improvising)
Because it isn’t! It’s what we healing experts call an essence. Did you know that dilution actually increases the effectiveness?
HOLLY
(quietly)
Magnus! That’s ridiculous!
MAGNUS
In fact, the more times we dilute, the stronger the essence becomes.
JEROME
Really.
HOLLY
That’s not how it—
(as Magnus covers her mouth)
mff mmblff!
MAGNUS
You’re a blacksmith, right? You know how my fellow monks of Dragon Mountain make their swords?
JEROME
What, by folding the metal over and over…?
MAGNUS
And beating it thinner and thinner. Keeping it lightweight and making it amazingly strong.
HOLLY
And you say I’m full of woo woo.
JEROME
That’s incredible. How come you don’t do that with all your potions?
MAGNUS
It’s a brand new technique. Everyone knows about the fantastic healing properties of the humble sludgewort plant. But it took the genius of Miss Alba Salix to realize that by diluting it, you multi-amplify its potential by a factor of one hundred-fold!
JEROME
Wow!
MAGNUS
Here, give it a try.
JEROME.
(drinks)
Ahh. I think I feel better already.
MAGNUS
See, Holly, he feels better already.
HOLLY
(leaving)
I’m telling Alba.
JEROME.
(sneezes again)
MAGNUS
That’ll be three crowns.
JEROME
Alba never charges that much for potions.
MAGNUS
This is our first premium product offering. If you have any side effects, we’ll give you double your money back! How about it?
JEROME
Well, okay.
SOUND: Coins
WALLA: Excited crowd
MAGNUS
Thank you, my good man. Here you go.
JEROME
Thanks. Tell Alba I said hello!
MAGNUS
Sludgewort essence, only three crowns a pop! Hello there, ma’am. How are you feeling today?
EXT. RIVERSIDE
SOUND: The market fades as they walk; distant seagulls
ALBA
So Withrow, what’s this conference you’re here for? The big magic exhibition isn’t until November…
WITHROW
Yeah, this is just a… sales conference.
(changing the subject)
Hey, want to head up to the bridge?
ALBA
Hmm. It’s not exactly the greatest neighbourhood on the other side.
WITHROW
We don’t have to cross. We’ll just go up to the lookout.
ALBA
All right.
WITHROW
Anyway, it’s not like you couldn’t defend yourself. Remember Scotty Gostrinder?
ALBA
Oh, gods, the “Chosen One”?
WITHROW
Hazelbrooke’s greatest boy hero.
ALBA
He defeated one lousy hydra…
WITHROW
And then he was dumb enough to challenge you to a magic duel. And before he could get his first spell out you up and hit him in the face.
ALBA
Smug little creep.
(pause)
Withrow, why did you have to go and tell my apprentice about our… school days?
WITHROW
Why not? That was our finest hour!
ALBA
Now he’s going to be all excited to learn about dark magic.
WITHROW
Hmm. Reminds me of this girl I used to have a thing for.
ALBA
You were the one always trying to summon demons.
WITHROW
They’re not all evil.
ALBA
No, just most of them.
WITHROW
And it wasn’t all dark magic. Lots of it was just being creative. Remember the sneezing powder in Mrs Saraling’s spellbook?
ALBA
That was a good one.
WITHROW
She turned half the class into slugs.
ALBA
The only time I saw her madder was when you set all the exam papers in the room on fire.
WITHROW
Yup. Accende meum ignem! (a‑CHEN-day MAY-oom IG-nem)
ALBA
Careful, now!
WITHROW
It’s okay. I didn’t do the hand motions.
SOUND: Footsteps stop
ALBA
It is a nice view, isn’t it?
WITHROW
You can see clear out to the Sea of Squidge.
ALBA
Beautiful. You know, I’ve lived in this city for years now, and never bothered to come up here.
WITHROW
Maybe you should get out of that House of Healing more often.
ALBA
I really should.
SOUND: Blade being drawn
MUGGER
Hold it right there.
WITHROW
Can we help you?
MUGGER
Yeah. Put your hands in the air. You stay quiet like mouses and nobody has to get hurt.
(beat)
What?
EXT. MARKET BOOTH
WALLA: Excited crowd—“hey, quit shoving!” “stay in line!”
SOUND: Coins
MAGNUS
Thank you, sir. Enjoy. Step right up, don’t be shy!
BERTHA
I’ll take some of that sludgewort.
MAGNUS
You bet. That’ll be six crowns.
BERTHA
Six?!
MAGNUS
Supply and demand, lady.
ANGIE
(from back of line)
Hey, hurry it up!
WALLA: Mutterings of agreement
SOUND: Rummaging in crate
MAGNUS
Oh, shoot. That was my last bottle.
(to crowd)
Hey, anybody got any empties? Or your own container? Half price if you drink it on the spot!
SOUND: Bottles clink
URCHIN
I got some empties here.
MAGNUS
Awesome. You, sir, are a fine, enterprising young gentleman. I’ll give you a nice shiny crown for ’em.
URCHIN
Make it five.
MAGNUS
Five crowns?
URCHIN
Each.
MAGNUS
What?!
URCHIN
Supply and demand.
ANGIE
What’s taking so long?
MAGNUS
One crown each.
URCHIN
Four. Take it or leave it.
MAGNUS
I’m not paying you four crowns for one bottle!
URCHIN
Oh well. See ya.
MAGNUS
No, wait! I’ll… Here.
SOUND: Coins counted out, scooped up
SOUND: Bottles clink
URCHIN
Nice doing business with you!
MAGNUS
Kids these days.
BERTHA
So if diluting this stuff makes it stronger, shouldn’t we water it down even more before we take it?
MAGNUS
Yes, that’s a great idea. How many bottles you want?
BERTHA
In that case, I guess, just the one. It should last us years, right?
MAGNUS
No, because… it doesn’t keep!
ANGIE
Bertha, here—I’ll give you half, and we can split the bottle.
CHARLIE
Hey, count me in. The more ways we split it…
BERTHA
All right. Each of you gimme two crowns, and come by my kitchen. I’ll give you your share.
MAGNUS
No! That’s not allowed! This is a specialized process done by specialized specialists. Do not attempt to water down this complex formula at home. Home dilutions are killing magic!
BERTHA
Here’s your six crowns.
MAGNUS
Not if you’re gonna split it. That’s twelve, no, eighteen crowns.
BERTHA
Say, let’s talk to Henry. He bought a bottle earlier. Maybe he’ll share.
MAGNUS
Where are you going? Hey! I just paid forty crowns for these damn bottles! Hey!
WALLA: Crowd dispersing

I’m serious. Your money or your life.
ALBA
I’m thinking neither.
MUGGER
C’mon. All your valuables in the bag or I start gettin’ expressive with this here pigsticker. What’s so funny?
WITHROW
Oh, nothing.
ALBA
Potes volare! (PO-tays vo-LA-ray)
SOUND: Magic shimmer
MUGGER
(hauled off his feet)
Aaaa!
WITHROW
I was thinking maybe turning him to ice, but levitation’s pretty good.
MUGGER
Please! I’m afraid of heights!
ALBA
Mm, this bridge is a bit tall, isn’t it?
WITHROW
Majestically tall.
ALBA
Quite a long way down to the river.
MUGGER
I’ll do anything…
ALBA
Hush, now. You wouldn’t want me to lose my concentration and… drop you.
MUGGER
(falls, then stops with a jerk)
AaaaAA!
WITHROW
(calling down to him)
You ought to be more careful who you try and rob.
MUGGER
I didn’t know she was a witch!
ALBA
(calling)
What does that matter? You don’t rob people.
MUGGER
Okay, okay! I’m sorry! I’ll… I’ll turn my life around!
(he plummets suddenly)
Aaaa!
(distant)
Please!
WITHROW
Ha, look at him. For a second there I thought you were gonna let him fall that whole way.
ALBA
From up here? It’d kill him. From halfway down… well, it’ll hurt, but he’ll be fine.
MUGGER
Aaaaaaa…!
SOUND: Splash
ALBA
Probably.
WITHROW
Maybe you should take up crime-fighting as a new hobby.
ALBA
I’ve missed doing that kind of magic. Whew. Except for the headache and shortness of breath.
WITHROW
Short of breath, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
ALBA
Tried what? Oh, don’t tell me you’re on the bandwagon too.
WITHROW
I’m… kind of the local sales rep for Farloria.
ALBA
Really. All right. So what’s in it?
WITHROW
It’s an all-natural herbal formula—
ALBA
So is stewed pimple grass.
WITHROW
No, this is the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it brings down inflammation, evens out your complexion, and it’s great for ulcers too. Here.
SOUND: Bottle uncorked
ALBA
You make this?
WITHROW
I’m a distributor. I can send some your way if you’re interested. It’ll add ten years to your life. And take ten years off your age!
ALBA
Okay, knock it off with the sales pitch.
(swallows)
Tastes all right. That’s usually a bad sign. Hmmm. You might be on to something, though…
WITHROW
How’s that headache?
ALBA
It works fast, doesn’t it?
WITHROW
Quicker than the caffeinated beavers of Lake Zoom.
ALBA
All right, I’m impressed.
WITHROW
Come by my room at the inn and I can give you a whole lot more.
ALBA
Buy a lady dinner first?
WITHROW
Why, naturally.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
ALBA
So, Mr McWhinney, what can I help you with today?
MCWHINNEY
Well, I’ve got this toothache, and a ringing in my ears whenever I open my eyes…
ALBA
Have you tried Frinozipax?
MCWHINNEY
Tried what?
ALBA
It’s an all-natural herbal formula. Not only does it relieve pain, it boosts your stamina, balances your humours, and it’s great for warts…
SOUND: Office door shuts
HOLLY
Is she going to prescribe that stuff to every single patient?
MAGNUS
Sure sounds that way.
HOLLY
I’ve gotta find out what’s in it.
MAGNUS
Me too.
HOLLY
You are not touching this stuff. Remember what Alba said.
MAGNUS
Figures. I’m not allowed to have a side business. But her old flame comes to town selling junk potions and she’s all over him like mice on gingerbread.
HOLLY
How are those bedpans coming?
MAGNUS
I think this violates the terms of my community service.
SOUND: Exterior door
ABE
Good morning, little lady. I have an appointment with Miss Salix.
HOLLY
It’s Abe, right? Just fill out this patient information form, and Alba will see you in a minute.
SOUND: Office door
ALBA
…so try the Frinozipax for a week and let me know if there’s any change.
MCWHINNEY
Thanks, Miss Salix.
ALBA
Bye now.
SOUND: Office door shuts.
MCWHINNEY
Abe! Fancy meeting you here.
ABE
Hey there, McWhinney.
MCWHINNEY
Never thought I’d see you at the doctor’s office.
ABE
Yeah, got an ulcer, I think.
MCWHINNEY
An ulcer, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
ABE
Rhinocer-what?
MCWHINNEY
It’s an all-natural herbal potion made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients.
ABE
And it cures ulcers?
MCWHINNEY
Yup, it’s the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it brings down inflammation, evens out your complexion, and it’s great for ulcers too.
ABE
Really!
MAGNUS
That’s exactly what Alba said to the guy before last.
HOLLY
This is creepy. I need to test this stuff. Alba!
SOUND: Office door
ALBA
Send in the next patient, Holly.
HOLLY
Alba, what exactly are the active ingredients in Frinozipax?
ALBA
Why, it’s an all-natural herbal formula made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients.
HOLLY
And why are they so secret?
MAGNUS
Say, I hear it’s great for headaches.
HOLLY
Magnus…
ALBA
Yup, this is the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it improves your eyesight, adds body and shine to your hair, and it’s great for headaches too.
HOLLY
And it seems to be controlling what you say.
ALBA
Nonsense. How can an all-natural herbal potion have any effect on what I say?
MAGNUS
Yeah, Holly. Say, what’s the cure for rocket fleas?
ALBA
Rocket fleas? You might want to try this new product we’ve got. It’s called—
MAGNUS AND HOLLY AND ALBA
—Frinozipax.
ALBA
Ah, you’ve heard of it?
HOLLY
It’s all you’ve talked about since we opened this morning!
ALBA
Well, it does have a thousand uses.
HOLLY
Can I try a bottle?
ALBA
Absolutely. Here you go.
MAGNUS
Alba, I have a hangnail.
HOLLY
Magnus!
ALBA
A hangnail? Well, we have a new product just in that you might be—what am I saying?
HOLLY
See, you keep talking about this stuff!
ALBA
I hope this wears off.
HOLLY
That’s why I need to test it.
ALBA
Good idea. See if it’s a Moliari curse.
SOUND: Stopper pops
HOLLY
Okay.
(tastes it, smacks her lips)
ALBA
Holly!
HOLLY
Nope, not Moliari. Wow, I see why people like it, though! I feel pretty good!
MAGNUS
That’s how you test it?
HOLLY
It’s my protocol number one! What? I feel fine.
ALBA
That was incredibly stupid.
HOLLY
I only took a tiny sip!
MAGNUS
You know, I think I might have gout.
ALBA AND HOLLY
Gout, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
MAGNUS
Why, no, I haven’t.
ALBA
Magnus.
MAGNUS
It sounds amazing.
ALBA
Stop it.
MAGNUS
What else does it do?
ALBA AND HOLLY
Oh, it’s a wonder of modern medicine.
ALBA
Not only does it cure gout…
HOLLY
It erases wrinkles…
ALBA
Builds strong teeth…
HOLLY
And it’s great with pie!
MAGNUS
Golly gee! What’s it made from?
ALBA AND HOLLY
It’s an all-natural herbal formula…
HOLLY
…wow, that’s crazy!
ALBA
(nonstop)
…made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients. Magnus, if you do that one more time I will cuff you.
MAGNUS
Totally, totally worth it.

Be right there!

SOUND: Door opens
WITHROW (CONT’D)
Alba! Back for more already?
ALBA
Why yes, you devil. And I could use another couple of cases of Frinozipax too.
WITHROW
Can do. Take as much as you need.
ALBA
It’s been flying off the shelves. What a day! I could use a dose myself.
WITHROW
Go right ahead.
SOUND: Bottle uncorked
ALBA
Thanks.
(drinks)
That’s odd. Does this taste funny to you?
WITHROW
Funny?
ALBA
Here, have a sip.
WITHROW
(drinks)
Seems fine to me.
ALBA
It isn’t expired, is it?
WITHROW
Can’t be. I just bottled that batch.
ALBA
So you bottle it yourself?
WITHROW
It’s a secret process. I can’t tell you much more than that.
ALBA
Of course you can tell me aaall about it.
WITHROW
It comes out of a special keg I got from Mister Benvenito. Wait—why did I just say that?
ALBA
Say what?
WITHROW
You swapped the bottle! That wasn’t Frinozipax you gave me!
ALBA
No. We altered the recipe a little. So, instead of selling more, it makes you tell the truth, Withrow.
WITHROW
Alba! I wouldn’t lie to you.
ALBA
For instance, where might I find this magical keg?
WITHROW
Why, it’s in my trunk. Hey! No! Alba!
ALBA
Get out of the way, Withrow.
WITHROW
I… I have a headache!
ALBA
A headache? Have you tried Frinozipax? Nice try, you sleazy cad!
SOUND: Flurry of blows from a purse
WITHROW
Ow! Ow! Alba, what’s Frinozipax?
ALBA
(furious)
Let me tell you all about Frinozipax! It’s an all-natural herbal potion made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients!
WITHROW
Ow! Help! Alba, please! I bruise easily!
ALBA
Not only does it relieve bruising, it brings down swelling, heals up friction burns, and it’s great for black eyes too. Except that it doesn’t really do any of that, does it, Withrow?
WITHROW
No. But it does relieve pain!
ALBA
For a little while—and then it fades. And every time you take it, it does less and less.
WITHROW
At least it works quickly…
SOUND: Latches click, then trunk opens
ALBA
Quicker than the Streaking Cheetahs of Highspeedia. This little keg here? I’m guessing it’s enchanted to provide an endless supply—am I right?
WITHROW
That’s right. Alba, don’t—Mister B will kill me if anything happens to it!
ALBA
Who is this Mister Benvenito?
WITHROW
He invented Frinozipax. He’s from Qwaytox…
ALBA
A demon, then! I should have known. So this “conference” you’re in town for…
WITHROW
I’ve been sworn to secrecy!
ALBA
I assume Mister Benvenito is running the show?
WITHROW
Yes… please give me the keg.
ALBA
And where is the conference?
WITHROW
At the Weird Fellows’ Lodge on Knife-Sharpeners’ Lane. Alba, I think I have the plague!
ALBA
The plague, you say?
SOUND: Big solid wooden smash and splatter
WITHROW
Nooo! Alba!
ALBA
Sorry, Frinozipax won’t cure the plague. Withrow, it’s been fun, but I draw the line at prescribing snake oil to my patients. If I ever catch you pulling this sort of stunt again, I will have you chucked in a dungeon so fast it’ll give the Streaking Cheetahs vertigo.
WITHROW
I’m a dead man, Alba! He really will kill me!
ALBA
You should have thought of that before you started working for a Qwaytoxian demon.
WITHROW
He’ll send me to the… the Home Office… Alba, I like my skin. I want to keep it.
ALBA
You’d better help me out, then, hadn’t you?
WITHROW
Yes, Alba.

Live and learn, folks. But now it’s time to award a very special vacation on the beautiful Meyurian Riviera to some very special and hard-working sales representatives—I’m talking, of course, about everyone in this room! Yeah! You! And you! And you! Everybody here gets a vacation!
WALLA: Cheering, even wilder than before
BENVENITO (CONT’D)
(to himself)
What a bunch of chumps. Where’s my drink?
WITHROW
Here, Mister Benvenito.
BENVENITO
(drinks, then spits)
What is this? I said wood alcohol! This is god damned Frinozipax!
WALLA: Sudden hush
WITHROW
Sorry, sir! Wrong bottle.
BENVENITO
What’s your name?
WITHROW
W‑Withrow Lee.
BENVENITO
Ah, yes, Withrow
How are ya? Enjoying the conference?
WITHROW
Yes, sir!
SOUND: Paper being flourished
BENVENITO
You remember this contract? Signing over your soul and all your earthly possessions to me? Remember the penalties for noncompliance?
WITHROW
I didn’t really read that part…
ALBA
And this is why we don’t do deals with demons.
BENVENITO
Say, folks, according to this, our good friend Withrow Lee has just earned an upgrade from re-education at the Home Office to eternal torment.
WITHROW
Accende meum ignem!
SOUND: Crackling flame
WALLA: Gasps
BENVENITO
Oh, now, Withrow
Did you really think that would work? Burning up one little piece of paper? When I have six more copies filed away in separate magic-proof vaults?
ALBA
No, but there’s still a loophole.
BENVENITO
Who the blazes are you?
ALBA
An interested party. Mister Benvenito, isn’t it true that you and your company can be banished from this earthly plane by saying your name three times?
BENVENITO
Of course it is. But it would have to be my true name. Why am I telling you this?
ALBA
Must be something in the water.
BENVENITO
That drink… you tricked me. Lee!
WITHROW
She made me do it!
ALBA
What’s your true name, demon?
BENVENITO
My name… is Astraxo. Dammit!
ALBA
Thanks.
ALBA AND WITHROW
Astraxo, diabolum! (dee-AB-o-lum) Astraxo, exeas! (ex-ZAY-ass) Astraxo effugare! (ef-foo-GA-ray)
SOUND: A giant clap of thunder
IMP
Hello, Kathmak Mystical Group. My name is Serdikos. You’re requesting the banishment of the demon Astraxo to his home realm of Qwaytox?
ALBA
That’s right…
IMP
No problem, ma’am, we can do that for you right now. I’ll just need you to answer three verification questions for me.
BENVENITO
Aha!
ALBA
What?
IMP
It’s just standard policy. Question one: What school did Mister Astraxo attend?
ALBA
Astraxo? Tell us.
BENVENITO
Well, I would, but I’m afraid I’ve gone and forgotten the answers!
WITHROW
I don’t think he’s lying.
ALBA
You’ve forgotten what school you went to?
BENVENITO
I expunged all those useless memories when I took over the family enterprise. I made room in my brain for strategy and logistics instead.
(scoffs)
Childhood. Such a pitiful, unproductive time.
ALBA
So what school? Braxonic College?
WITHROW
A demon of his rank? Naw.
(to Benvenito)
Was it Creepside?
SOUND: Clang
IMP
Thank you.
BENVENITO
Lucky guess.
IMP
Question two… What was Mister Astraxo’s favourite book growing up?
ALBA
How old are you?
BENVENITO
Seventy-two. Arghh!
ALBA
That narrows it down a little.
WITHROW
“Gertie the Goblin”? “The Sword in the Stove”?
BENVENITO
I’m not saying! I can’t hear you!
ALBA
“The Littlest Unicorns”.
SOUND: Clang
BENVENITO
That’s not true! I hate unicorns!
IMP
That’s the answer I have here. Finally… what was the name of your first pet growing up?
BENVENITO
I didn’t have a pet. I ate every animal that came into my family’s cave!
IMP
Well, maybe so, but it says here you named at least one of them.
ALBA
Remember… was it a bunny? A kitty? A lightning lizard?
BENVENITO
I can’t hear you, la la la!
(then, faraway)
Lizard…
ALBA
Aha! What did your lizard look like, Astraxo? What colour?
BENVENITO
Red… he was red.
ALBA
Did he sleep on your bed at night?
BENVENITO
He… he used to sleep in the coals in the fireplace, or if he wanted to cool off he’d sleep on my pillow. He was the best.
ALBA
And you called him…
BENVENITO
B‑Bloodstone.
SOUND: Clang
IMP
Thank you for verifying… we’ll just go ahead with that banishment now. Have a great day and thank you for choosing Kathnak.
BENVENITO
Wretched humans! You’ll be hearing from our lawyers!
SOUND: A noise like a huge drainpipe and a clap of thunder
WALLA: Shock, turning to anger
ALBA
Good riddance. Well, good news, everyone. You’re free now—no longer slaves to a cruel, avaricious demon.
(pause)
Er… don’t all thank me at once.
FIRST SALES REP
That was our livelihood!
SECOND SALES REP
And now you’ve voided our contracts.
WITHROW
Uh oh.
THIRD SALES REP
What about my free vacation?
WALLA: Outrage—cries of “yeah!” and a growing chorus of “kill! kill!”
WITHROW
Alba!
ALBA
There’s just no pleasing some people.
WITHROW
Ruuun!

That’s a pretty dress, Mummy.
PARABEL
Thank you, Willemina!
WILLEMINA
Is it for the wedding?
PARABEL
Why, yes it is.
WILLEMINA
Will Princess Minsey have a dress like that?
PARABEL
No, this one is nicer, because the queen has to have the best dress of all.
WILLEMINA
I guess that’s fair.
PARABEL
Of course it is.
WILLEMINA
Because Princess Minsey is prettiest.
PARABEL
What, darling?
WILLEMINA
Daddy says Minsey will be riding a unicorn.
PARABEL
Does he.
WILLEMINA
Did you have a unicorn at your wedding, Mummy?
PARABEL
No, just regular old horses.
WILLEMINA
Oh. Was this before unicorns?
PARABEL
Before unicorns?
WILLEMINA
You know. In old people times.
PARABEL
What’s that supposed to mean?
WILLEMINA
You’re the queen. ‘Cause you’re married and you’re old.

BULWARK
…take thee, Princess Minsey, to be my lawful wedded wife…
SOUND: The ceremony continues as we crossfade to…
GUNTHER
Who would have thought? Two warring nations finding peace at last through marriage—between two young people who actually love one another.
PARABEL
Who would have thought?
GUNTHER
Goodness, look at them. It takes me right back to our wedding.
PARABEL
Our wedding wasn’t quite this big. And this is just the rehearsal.
GUNTHER
Well, one has to put on a show for the foreign dignitaries, you know…
PARABEL
Of course.

I’m sorry, I’m just so excited. I’ve been practicing for tomorrow!

Well, I’m happy to see your darling niece is enjoying herself.
GUNTHER
So am I. I can’t imagine a sweeter, more deserving girl.
PARABEL
Can’t you.
GUNTHER
Other than yourself, of course.
PARABEL
Of course.
SOUND: A shimmer of magic
ALBA
Quidem, illud tutus saltare… (QUID-dem ILL-ood TOOT-us sal-TAH-ray)
GUNTHER
Alba? What are you doing?
ALBA
Just a bit of protective magic for your Majesties. Something bad is in the air.
PARABEL
Yes, I believe it’s that horrid incense you’ve been waving around.
ALBA
A huge international event like this is a perfect target for someone with their eye on your kingdom, and your heads.
GUNTHER
Magical security is already being taken care of by Mister Krankel.
PARABEL
Doctor Krankel.
ALBA
I know. You might as well put the Poachers’ Guild in charge of the Royal Jackalope Sanctuary.
GUNTHER
Nonsense.
PARABEL
The Sorceror General has always been—
ALBA
—always been a power-hungry, conniving rat. And since when are you a fan of his?
PARABEL
I just think he deserves a fair shake, that’s all.
ALBA
I’ll give him a fair shake.
GUNTHER
Alba, let’s discuss this after the rehearsal.
ALBA
All right. But mark my words—there is an evil force, lurking in the shadows to ruin the royal wedding.
PARABEL
(under her breath)
Well, we can hope.

INT. PALACE COURTYARD
SOUND: Lively chatter
GUNTHER
Looking forward to the wedding tomorrow, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHART
I hate these ceremonies, myself. I’ll just be glad to see my youngest married off, the damn fool.
GUNTHER
Prince Bulwark seems like a fine lad. Sharp as a hedgehog’s backside.
ROCKHART
Always littering the place with his poetry and depressing us with his terrible songs. I blame the wife, you know. Coddled him terribly.
GUNTHER
But luckily he’s found love at last.
ROCKHART
Yes, I suppose. Minsey’s a lovely girl, for a foreigner. I expect she’ll measure up.
GUNTHER
“Measure up”?
ROCKHART
Perform, you know. Make a man of young Bully. He could use it.
GUNTHER
I see.
ROCKHART
She’s a fine woman. Speaking of which, that Queen of yours—phwoar!
PARABEL
I beg your pardon?
ROCKHART
(to Gunther)
Ooo, look, she’s pretty when she’s angry. So prim and proper in public. But I’ll bet she’s a real tiger in the old royal bedchamber, what?
PARABEL
One happens to be standing right here, Your Magnificence.
ROCKHART
Too bad she hasn’t been able to give you any male heirs.
GUNTHER
Well! We should be getting on. We’ll see you at dinner, then, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHART
Indeed.
(whispers, to Parabel)
Wear something low-cut, eh?
PARABEL
(gasps)
Well, I never! And you said nothing to defend me.
GUNTHER
Dear, the man has a whole army at our doorstep. It’s best we don’t wag our fingers in the face of the hungry dog of fate.
MINSEY
Uncle Gunther! Aunt Parabel!
PARABEL
Oh no.
GUNTHER
Minsey! How’s my favourite niece?
MINSEY
Oh, I’m in such a muddle! I didn’t mean to rush ahead at the altar, but I couldn’t help it!
PARABEL
Anything to get through it faster.
MINSEY
Did you see Bully’s face? When we got to the vows he did that little thing where his lips get squinched up…
GUNTHER
I’m sure it was suitably adorable.
MINSEY
And tomorrow we get to do it all again for real!
PARABEL
Yes! Wonderful!
MINSEY
I’m afraid I might just explode!
(giggles)
PARABEL
Oh, please don’t do that…
GUNTHER
Speaking of tomorrow—I brought you this.
MINSEY
A necklace? Oh, Uncle, it’s beautiful!
PARABEL
(sweetly)
Gunther, darling…
GUNTHER
It was made for your grandmother Queen Ursula.
MINSEY
Oh, Uncle!
PARABEL
(whispering)
Sweetie bear, did you just give her my necklace?
MINSEY
I love it so much.
PARABEL
(whispering)
From our wedding?
GUNTHER
(whispering)
You haven’t worn it since. I thought you didn’t like it.
PARABEL
(whispering)
What does that have to do with it?
MINSEY
Thank you, Uncle G!
GUNTHER
You’re welcome, Minsey.
MINSEY
It’ll go so nicely with my dress! It was sewn by mice, you know. Mice! Isn’t it all just too perfect!
(giggles)
PARABEL
(laughs)
Yes. It’s just too perfect.

Colour… asparagus green.
HOLLY
(singing)
Wedding day! Wedding day!
MAGNUS
Black bile levels… twenty point three…
HOLLY
(singing)
It’s a perfect day to get married, especially if you’re a princess or a prince!
MAGNUS
Yellow bile, seventy-two point… Holly, do you really have to sing while you work?
HOLLY
Yes! We fairies have music in our very souls.
MAGNUS
And candy floss in your very brains.
HOLLY
Oh, Magnus, listen to you. It’s a bright, sunny day, and tomorrow, Princess Minsey will get married to the Prince of Balgomar, and you? You’re just the grumpiest thing on two legs.
MAGNUS
You’re right, Holly, it’s such a beautiful day to be stuck in the office at the House of Healing testing urine samples.
(sighs)
So what are you doing inside?
HOLLY
I’m brewing a cordial from the fruit of the rare Gesundephat tree.
MAGNUS
That’s what all that mess in the laboratory is for?
HOLLY
It’s a gift for the Prince and Princess!
MAGNUS
Alba’s gonna kill you.
HOLLY
It’s okay, it’s nearly finished.
SOUND: Exterior door
MAGNUS
Speak of the witch.
HOLLY
Hi, Alba!
ALBA
Holly, where were you this morning? I could have used some help with my protective spells for the Royal Family.
HOLLY
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot! I’m so sorry, Alba. How many good deeds do I owe you now?
ALBA
I lost count at forty. And for heaven’s sake, will someone clean up this damned office?
HOLLY
So was the rehearsal nice? I hear they’re going to have fountains that pour out chocolate, custard and strawberry jam!
SOUND: Interior door slams
HOLLY
Gosh. I hope she’s feeling all right.
MAGNUS
Duh. It’s the wedding.
HOLLY
But everyone loves weddings! There’s cake! And flowers! And cake!
MAGNUS
That’s just it. Remember? Her own lack of a happily-ever-after royal wedding?
HOLLY
Huh?
MAGNUS
Don’t you know how the King and Queen got married?
HOLLY
My memories from back then are a bit foggy.
MAGNUS
And you wonder why I don’t try your fairy drinks.
HOLLY
So, what about the King and Queen?
MAGNUS
Okay, once upon a time, when the King was still a prince, he got turned into a goat by an evil witch.
HOLLY
Really?
MAGNUS
People came from all over the kingdom to see if they could cure him. They tried magic, acupuncture, hot baths… nothing worked. And then three sisters came to the Palace.
HOLLY
Did they cure him?
MAGNUS
The oldest one cast a spell but it didn’t work. The middle sister brought a magic flower from a far-off mountain, but that didn’t work. Then the youngest one came over and kissed him… and he became human again.
HOLLY
Awwww! And that was Queen Parabel?
MAGNUS
Yup. They got married a week later. But the older sisters were jealous because they’d failed.
HOLLY
I guess they must have been. Poor Alba.
MAGNUS
Yeah, well, don’t mention it to her. She’s kind of touchy about it. Probably it was her last chance at scoring a husband or something.
SOUND: Interior door
ALBA
Holly, did you finish brewing that liniment for Mr. Woo?
HOLLY
Working on it! Alba, I’m so sorry about your wedding.
ALBA
My wedding?
HOLLY
Or, I mean… the fact you didn’t have a wedding because you didn’t cure the King that one time. Prince, I mean. Who’s now the King.
ALBA
Holly, I really do need that liniment.
HOLLY
It’s okay, Alba, I understand. It can be tough making up for your own mistakes. I should know!
ALBA
Never mind. I’ll make it myself.
HOLLY
All this wedding business must be such a painful reminder of past trauma that you can’t think clearly.
ALBA
Holly, I think you might want to leave the building while you still can.
HOLLY
But I have to filter my cordial!
ALBA
What cordial?
HOLLY
The one I’ve been making for the Prince and Princess!
ALBA
You mean the orange muck I just poured down the drain?
HOLLY
You just what?
ALBA
I threw it out.
HOLLY
But… but I’ve been infusing that for eleven days! Do you know how hard it was to find a ripe Gesundephat fruit at this time of year?
ALBA
I can’t make proper medicines when all the equipment in my laboratory is full of vile-smelling moonshine brewed by a brainless bumpkin fairy.
HOLLY
Alba! That’s… that’s the meanest thing anybody has ever said to anybody ever!
ALBA
There’s plenty more where it came from.
HOLLY
I thought you cared.
ALBA
Holly, if you don’t clear out this minute it’s going to be very bad for your health.
HOLLY
Well, I’m not sorry about your non-marriage. I hope all your days are filled with regret and loneliness. And no cake. Ever.
SOUND: Exterior door slams
MAGNUS
Boy, some people just have no tact.
INT. PALACE HALL
GUNTHER
More wine, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHART
Don’t mind if I do.
SOUND: Pouring
GUNTHER
Er, I wonder if we might get on to resolving the territorial dispute over the Pointy Lands.
ROCKHART
Dispute?
GUNTHER
Well, disagreement.
ROCKHART
Are you disagreeing with me?
GUNTHER
Difference of opinion?
ROCKHART
What opinion? We propose to hand back the Pointy Lands to Farloria.
GUNTHER
Really!
ROCKHART
In exchange for which Balgomar will retain the right to extract any minerals and mystical energies from the surrounding Loo Lines.
GUNTHER
But the coast is unstable there. The chances of a mystical accident—
ROCKHART
Are two million percent. Or two million to one. Something with zeroes in it. Anyway, if it does blow up, in all likelihood the wind will carry all the residue southward.
GUNTHER
Into Farlorian territory.
ROCKHART
Well, I daresay you lot are quite used to that sort of thing, what?
GUNTHER
We’d also like to see Balgomarian troops pull back from the River Twist.
ROCKHART
We’d love to!
GUNTHER
Oh!
ROCKHART
In an ideal world, of course we would. We’d withdraw them all in a heartbeat. But sadly, we live in a world of whatchemacallem, geopolitical instability, what. A king needs armies.
GUNTHER
But do those armies have to be sitting on our border, Magnificence?
ROCKHART
They have to sit somewhere.
GUNTHER
Surely you have other borders to defend?
ROCKHART
Yes, but those are with our enemies.
GUNTHER
Not sure I get your meaning.
ROCKHART
It’ll make them wonder. “If those Balgomarians have an army like that poised to lay waste to Farloria at a moment’s notice,” they’ll say to themselves, “what terrible ruin could they wreak on us?”
GUNTHER
Ah.
ROCKHART
They’ll think twice about invading once they see how well we fortify ourselves against friendly nations! And Gunther, my boy, I’d certainly call Balgomar and Farloria friendly nations, wouldn’t you?
GUNTHER
Of course, Your Magnificence.
INT. OFFICE OF THE SORCEROR GENERAL
PARABEL
By the rose and by the fern / By the frond and by the thorn / To honey sweet this water turn / By the first light of the morn.
SOUND: Magic twinkling, turning warped and ugly
PARABEL
Oh dear. The roses are all going brown. Does that mean it’s working?
KRANKEL
Perhaps flower charms are not Your Majesty’s forte either.
PARABEL
I thought flowers might help me to relax.
KRANKEL
As I have said before, I suspect that Your Majesty’s natural predisposition is toward elemental magic.
PARABEL
Well, then, do teach me some, Doctor Krankel.
KRANKEL
Of course.
(thinks)
Ah. Your Majesty, observe the steam from this teacup.
SOUND: Tea poured, cup clinks
PARABEL
Yes.
KRANKEL
Concentrate on the patterns it makes as it moves.
PARABEL
It’s rising…
KRANKEL
Indeed. Watch the currents as it rises and… er… forms itself into a small black cloud. Good heavens.
SOUND: A tiny clap of thunder, a rising hiss—then a bang and a shower of tea and teacup bits
PARABEL
Oh!
KRANKEL
Dear me.
PARABEL
Was it supposed to do that?
KRANKEL
It may be safest to finish up Your Majesty’s lesson for the day.
PARABEL
I don’t know what happened.
KRANKEL
Nervous tension may be a factor. To do, perhaps, with the royal nuptials tomorrow?
PARABEL
No, everything is wonderful. Everyone thinks the Prince and Princess are the most beautiful couple that ever walked the aisle. And Gunther’s been kind enough to go through all my closets to save me the trouble of choosing gifts.
KRANKEL
Truly a grand day for our kingdom. To say nothing of its new “allies”.
PARABEL
Ohhh! Those Balgomarians have no respect at all. The things they say about me! I’m Queen, for heaven’s sake.
KRANKEL
But a Queen, if Your Majesty will forgive me, who was born a commoner. The Balgomarians have little respect for any ruler not descended from a royal bloodline.
PARABEL
The filthy brigands.
KRANKEL
Which is a worrying thought. If the Balgomarians were to “consolidate their influence” here in Farloria, they might decide our kingdom would be better ruled by Prince Bulwark and his new bride.
PARABEL
Rule Farloria? Those little twerps?
KRANKEL
I fear so. And there would go Your Present Majesties’ heads.
PARABEL
You really think they would kill us?
KRANKEL
They did it to Lord Ponsling and the Duke of Norwexony.
PARABEL
Something must be done.
KRANKEL
As you say, Majesty. But where to begin?
PARABEL
Well, between you and me, Doctor Krankel… I’m a little concerned about Princess Minsey’s ears.
KRANKEL
Come again?
PARABEL
Some feel they’re too big.
KRANKEL
Surely that’s up to the groom to decide?
PARABEL
That’s what I said. But after the rehearsal I’m sure I heard some of the Balgomarian royals chatting, and they were making the most unfortunate comments. Large ears are considered bad luck, apparently. Something about demonic rabbits.
KRANKEL
Ah. Well, when one marries one’s niece to a foreign prince, one has to put up with foreign folk beliefs.
PARABEL
So. Do you think there’s anything we can do for poor dear Princess Minsey?
KRANKEL
Did Your Majesty have anything in particular in mind?
INT. PALACE CHAMBERS
ALBA
Dead? The Princess is dead?
PARABEL
I’m afraid so. Such a terrible thing. Her lady in waiting found her this morning.
ALBA
Parabel, I’m so sorry. Gunther must be devastated.
PARABEL
It was so sudden. I can’t understand it.
KRANKEL.
(arriving)
I can. This was lying beside the young lady’s bed. An empty bottle of extract of croakweed—a deadly poison.
PARABEL
Poison! Well, so much for all your protective spells, then.
ALBA
She must have taken it herself.
PARABEL
Suicide?
ALBA
No, it would have to have been by mistake. The magic would have kept anyone from poisoning Minsey deliberately, herself included. But where could she have gotten croakweed?
PARABEL
Yes, where?
KRANKEL
Well, if you’ll look closely, the bottle’s label bears the seal of the House of Healing.
ALBA
What?
PARABEL
Alba! You don’t mean to say that you had something to do with it?
ALBA
How could I have?
PARABEL
You poisoned the Princess!
ALBA
Parabel, why would I do a thing like that?
PARABEL
You never liked poor Minsey.
ALBA
Whereas you loved her more than life itself.
PARABEL
Perhaps her wedding was too much of a reminder of how you lost the chance to marry your own prince?
ALBA
That was nine years ago, Parabel. I think I’m quite over it, thank you.
KRANKEL
The question remains: how did the Princess happen to obtain a bottle of deadly poison from the House of Healing?
PARABEL
Yes, how?
ALBA
Oh no.
INT. CHAPEL
MAGNUS
I didn’t know! Honest! She came in dressed like a farm girl. I didn’t know who she was.
GUNTHER
And you gave her the croakweed?
MAGNUS
How was I supposed to know it was poison?
ALBA
Did you happen to notice the great big skull on the side of the bottle?
MAGNUS
I was too busy trying to read Holly’s handwriting.
ROCKHART
The Kingdom of Balgomar demands that this witch and her ridiculous assistant be punished for this injury to our people!
MAGNUS
Hey, now…
GUNTHER
Injury to your people?
ROCKHART
The death of my son’s bride-to-be! We demand that these two be not only hanged, but preferably drawn and quartered, and possibly roasted first!
GUNTHER
This witch happens to be Royal Physician and sister to the Queen.
ROCKHART
It matters not.
ALBA
Your Majesty, I’m sure there’s an explanation for this. I need to examine the Princess.
ROCKHART
In order to work some foul magic on the body, I’ll wager!
GUNTHER
The Royal Physician may examine the Princess.
MAGNUS
And her assistant?
ROCKHART
Silence!
ALBA
Wait. There’s a pulse.
GUNTHER
You mean she’s…
ALBA
It’s very, very slow and faint, but there’s a pulse.
GUNTHER
But she’s cold as ice! And when we held a mirror to her face, there wasn’t breath enough to make it fog up.
ALBA
Well, I have good news, Your Majesty. Princess Minsey is alive.
GUNTHER
Thank heavens!
ALBA
But she is in a deep, deep sleep. Hmm. Her pupils are dilated, and there’s… a silver star in each of her eyes.
ROCKHART
Meaning what?
ALBA
Meaning… she didn’t take croakweed after all. It was cloakweed! Magnus, you idiot, you’ve saved the day.
MAGNUS
Just doing my job.
GUNTHER
How long will she sleep for?
ALBA
If she drank an entire bottle at my usual strength… a hundred years.
GUNTHER
A hundred! Is there a cure?
SOUND: Door creaks open
BULWARK
(a dramatic groan)
Ohhh…
GUNTHER
Your Highness!
ROCKHART
Bulwark! What are you doing here, boy?
BULWARK
Oh, Minsey my love.
GUNTHER
We have good news and bad news, Your Highness.
BULWARK
So beautiful even under this shroud of gloomy night eternal. Perchance might a kiss break the spell and restore to you your precious life?
(kisses her)
ALBA
Your Highness, please don’t disturb the patient.
BULWARK
Nothing! Oh Minsey, why must it end like this?
ROCKHART
Bulwark! Pull yourself together.
GUNTHER
The Princess still lives.
BULWARK
Indeed! Her soul resides now in heaven above, as doth her spirit in my heart.
ALBA
No, literally, Your Highness, she’s still—
BULWARK
But if our love cannot in this life, than mayhap in the next.
SOUND: Sword drawn
GUNTHER
Your Highness!
ROCKHART
Stop it, boy! What’s gotten into you?
BULWARK
Farewell, O cruel world that might make… O cruel world that… oh, hang it all. A failure to the end, I die.
(stabs himself)
Aghh!
ROCKHART
Bulwark!
BULWARK
I die… I die, Minsey. Oh, drat and fizzle, that hurt.
SOUND: A thump; his sword clatters to the ground
ROCKHART
You imbecile! She’s alive.
BULWARK
A‑alive?
ROCKHART
I should simply let you expire and lay waste to this puny so-called kingdom.
GUNTHER
No need for that!
BULWARK
Father, please, no!
ROCKHART
(sighs)
But I grow soft-headed in my old age. You! Physician!
ALBA
Yes, Your Magnificence.
ROCKHART
How are you at healing foolish boys who have run themselves through with swords?
ALBA
It’s quickly becoming my specialty.
MAGNUS
Heh.
EXT. FOREST, NIGHT
SOUND: Crickets
HOLLY
…I just couldn’t believe she threw it away. After all my work! You think you know a person, and then you find out you were actually thinking about a different person. A person who’s mean and spiteful and gives other witches a bad name. I’m sorry to burden you with all this, Mister Moth. You’re such a good listener.
ALBA
(approaching)
Holly?
HOLLY
(wary)
Alba. What are you doing here?
ALBA
I need your help.
HOLLY
What’s that? You need a bumpkin fairy to stand around while you insult her and destroy her work?
ALBA
I’m sorry, Holly. I shouldn’t have done that. Even if you were getting on my nerves.
HOLLY
See, I can’t do anything right.
ALBA
Now stop it.
HOLLY
I’m a bad fairy. And you… you are an evil witch.
ALBA
Holly, you’ve been working at the House of Healing for how many months now?
HOLLY
Three. No. Eleven. No. Do you mean human months?
ALBA
We’ve saved lives, Holly. We’ve helped a poor prince turn back into a frog. We’ve cured people of the shrieking cough and the flattened fifths. Do you call that evil?
HOLLY
You lied to Jerome. You said he couldn’t talk for a week or he’d die.
ALBA
I may have exaggerated a little.
HOLLY
And you hit those two little kids and turned them purple.
ALBA
They tried to stick me in the oven, Holly.
HOLLY
Because they were scared of you! And what about that constipation remedy you gave to the Lord Mayor?
ALBA
All right, all right. But does any of that outweigh the good I’ve done? The good we’ve done for the people of this kingdom?
HOLLY
(considers)
No. But you went and threw out the cordial I’d been brewing for a week and a half.
ALBA
I know. I’m sorry.
HOLLY
Now I have nothing to give the Prince and Princess!
ALBA
Nonsense. Holly, you’re a fairy.
HOLLY
What does that have to do with—
ALBA
And they’re a young, soon-to-be-married couple.
HOLLY
So?
ALBA
Who might be on the way to having children soon. Children who might need a little help from a fairy as they grow up?
HOLLY
You mean—you mean help from me?
ALBA
You’re getting the idea.
HOLLY
You think I could be a fairy godmother?
ALBA
Why not?
HOLLY
Watch over their children? Impart wisdom? Make them beautiful clothes for the ball?
ALBA
The word of a fairy would be a gift more precious than any potion.
HOLLY
You’re right! Oh my gosh, you’re so right. Thank you, Alba! I can’t wait to tell the Prince and Princess!
ALBA
That’s where I need your help. Something’s happened to Minsey.
HOLLY
Oh no! What?
ALBA
She’s taken cloakweed and now she’s in a deep, deep sleep. We have to work a spell to wake her.
HOLLY
Okay. What do we need?
INT. CHAPEL
SOUND: Cauldron bubbling
ALBA
One coffee bean.
MAGNUS
One coffee bean.
SOUND: A small plop, and stirring
ALBA
A feather from the early bird.
HOLLY
One feather.
ALBA
The first rays of dawn captured in amber.
HOLLY
Check.
SOUND: A little glow
ALBA
One drop of the Princess’s blood.
MAGNUS
Coming up.
SOUND: Sword unsheathed—shing!
ALBA
One drop.
MAGNUS
We might need extra.
(sighs)
Okay, one drop.
SOUND: Sword sheathed
SOUND: Needles rattle
ALBA
The crow of a rooster.
HOLLY
Got it.
SOUND: A small bottle uncorked
SOUND: Rooster crow, thin and wavering
MAGNUS
Here. One drop of blood.
ALBA
Smelling salts from the Stinking Sea of Stank.
HOLLY
(holding her nose)
Right here.
ALBA
And finally, a whisker from a cat who has trodden on someone’s privates every morning for twenty years.
MAGNUS
Yup. Good old Mittens.
SOUND: Stirring, percolating
HOLLY
Almost ready, Alba.
ALBA
Surgamus et eamus. (SUR-ga-mus et AY-a-mus)
SOUND: Puff of steam and magic flourish, a bell in reverse
HOLLY
(wheezing)
Wow, it’s… certainly powerful.
ALBA
That would be the smelling salts.
MAGNUS
Ugh. If this doesn’t wake her up, nothing will.
ALBA
Hold her mouth open for me.
MAGNUS
Yup.
SOUND: Pouring. more magic
MINSEY
(sleepy, delicate coughing)
Oh my. Oh dear. Oh, yucky! What’s that?
ALBA
Your Highness. Don’t try to sit up yet.
MINSEY
Oh goodness. Where am I?
BULWARK
Is it true? It is!
MINSEY
My prince!
BULWARK
I was afraid I’d lost you forever.
MINSEY
Darling, your tunic is all bloodied! Have you been hurt?
BULWARK
They said you were dead, my love. I simply couldn’t go on without you.
MINSEY
(breathless)
You mean, you tried to kill yourself? Because of me?
BULWARK
Yes!
MINSEY
Well, that was a bit silly. What if I were still alive?
BULWARK
And you are, love!
MINSEY
Well, then, it was very silly of you!
BULWARK
I am a silly, aren’t I?
MINSEY
You are such a silly.
BULWARK
But I’m your silly.
MINSEY
My big, silly, silly Prince Bully.
(they both giggle)
BULWARK
Oh, Minsey, you do have the dearest smile. My only sorrow is that I cannot see it and kiss you at the same time.
MINSEY
You could paint a picture?
BULWARK
That would be silly.
MINSEY
Yes!
(giggles)
HOLLY
It’s the cutest thing ever. The cutest thing ever!
MAGNUS
Pardon me while I go find a bucket to be sick in.
ALBA
Bring two.
INT. PALACE COURTYARD
GUNTHER
Are we all set? Is everyone alive and accounted for?
MINSEY
Here, Uncle Gunther!
ALBA
The bride is in perfect health, and the groom is healing up quite nicely. And I have my team on hand in case of any emergencies.
KRANKEL.
(entering grandly)
Your Majesty.
GUNTHER
Yes, Mister Krankel?
KRANKEL
Doctor Krankel. My analysis of the residue confirms that it was indeed cloakweed, not croakweed. The mislabeling of the bottle certainly paints the House of Healing in a poor light.
ALBA
My assistant’s handwriting aside, we still don’t know why Princess Minsey took the croakweed in the first place.
GUNTHER
That’s true. Minsey dear, why did you go looking for croakweed?
MINSEY
Oh, that! It was…
(whispers, embarrassed)
It was for my ears. Big ears are bad luck in Balgomar, you know.
KRANKEL
A ridiculous superstition.
GUNTHER
Who told you that? Prince Bulwark?
MINSEY
No, he wouldn’t! It was Auntie Parabel.
GUNTHER
Parabel?!
PARABEL
(arriving)
Yes, darling?
GUNTHER
Minsey says you told her to take croakweed.
MINSEY
She said it was the only thing that would help.
PARABEL
(taken off guard)
Well! Yes! It was her ears, you know. I heard Prince Bully’s family whispering about them behind her back.
GUNTHER
Her ears?
MINSEY
In Balgomarian they’re called “the horns of the demon rabbit”.
PARABEL
And I was told that croakweed would shrink them.
ALBA
Told by whom?
PARABEL
(beat)
It was Krankel. He specifically told me to recommend it.
KRANKEL
I—!
GUNTHER
Krankel! Explain yourself.
KRANKEL
Your Majesty! I said no such thing!
GUNTHER
Please tell me you didn’t suggest that my niece, the Princess of Mediocria, take a deadly poison to shrink her ears.
KRANKEL
Majesty! I did nothing to harm the Princess! It was the Queen! The jealous, fickle Queen!
GUNTHER
What?
PARABEL
Don’t listen to him. He tried to kill Minsey! Alba was right—he is out to take over the kingdom.
GUNTHER
Really.
PARABEL
Gunther, you can’t possibly believe that I wanted to kill your darling niece.
GUNTHER
Of course not.
PARABEL
Guards, seize that man!
SOUND: Boots step forward, swords drawn
GUNTHER
Well, Krankel, what do you have to say?
KRANKEL
Your Majesty, I protest! Clearly this is a case of—oh my, look over there!
GUNTHER and GUARD. What?
KRANKEL
Apodidraskein! (ah-po-dee-DRASS-kane)
SOUND: Big magical zap! then silence
PARABEL
He’s gone! Escaped!
GUNTHER
Guards! Search the Palace. And the Office of the Sorceror General.
ALBA
I doubt you’ll find anything.
GUNTHER
Where’s he gone, then?
ALBA
I don’t know. But I’m certain we haven’t seen the last of Helbard Krankel.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING
HOLLY
Morning, Alba!
ALBA
(hums to herself)
Good morning, Holly. Good morning, Magnus.
MAGNUS
Gee, you’re… chipper. Are you feeling all right?
ALBA
Never better.
HOLLY
See, Magnus? A royal wedding lifts everyone’s spirits.
ALBA
As does the chance to say “I told you so” to the King and Queen.
MAGNUS
Aren’t you worried, though? Krankel is on the loose somewhere, probably with a big fat grudge.
ALBA
Oh, yes. But if I know him at all, he’ll be biding his time before he makes a move. And when he does, I’ll be ready.
MAGNUS
Maybe you should be teaching me some magic, in case he comes back and I need to defend myself.
ALBA
I’ve told you, I’ll teach you some magic as soon as you’re done getting our patient records back in order from that explosion.
MAGNUS
Have you looked at our patient records lately?
ALBA
Yes, what about them?
MAGNUS
You didn’t notice anything different?
SOUND: Wooden drawer slides open; riffling through papers
ALBA
Well, I thought it seemed a bit easier finding everything…
MAGNUS
Right?
ALBA
When did you get all this done?
MAGNUS
Oh, in between my seven hundred other chores. So how about it? A little magic training for your hard-working apprentice?
HOLLY
Uh, Alba…
ALBA
All right. I suppose you’ve earned a lesson or two.
MAGNUS
Yeaaah.
ALBA
Go find a bottle of fireweed oil and a box of thumbtacks and meet me in the library.
MAGNUS
(leaving)
You got it, boss.
SOUND: Paper rustle
HOLLY
Alba, these aren’t really in alphabetical order… and these patient names are gibberish.
ALBA
I know. It looks like Magnus enchanted my pen and had it relabel everything.
HOLLY
But you’re really going to teach him magic?
ALBA
No. I’m going to teach him a lesson. Or two.
