          <p>You don't often see Old Jack inside of Mary's. Oh sure, you'll see him around. Sat on the sidewalk outside the doors. Rummaging through the dumpsters. Asleep in the alley. But every once in a while winds up inside. Sometimes with loose change and crumpled bills to pay for a cup of coffee or a sandwhich. But other times, relying on the kindness of other people. It's the latter in this case.&nbsp;</p><p>At an out of the way table, he sits with Oona. One of the smaller tables, just for two, against the wall. On his own, Jack would take the seat facing the door and most of the windows, but today he's yielded it to Oona. Everything about him says 'old and worn,' from his duct-taped sneakers, to his many-patched jeans, to his worn old flannel, to his wrinkled winter coat. And he smells. Not exceptionally <em>badly</em>, not like urine and rot, but like he hasn't seen the inside of a shower, nor his clothes the inside of a washing machine, in a while.&nbsp;</p><p>But he and Oona are out of the way. Where, hopefully, Old Jack won't bother the other customers too much. <span style=""color: rgb(84, 141, 212);"">""S'not the same,""</span> Old Jack is saying to Oona, looking at the tea bag in his mug with dissatisfaction. He's got a deep voice, low, and kinda mumbly and grumbly. <span style=""color: rgb(84, 141, 212);"">""Should be loose-leaf.</span>"" A sadly common complaint. He grunts in disappointment, but none the less circles his hands around the mug, stealing what heat he can from the ceramic into his scarred, worn fingers.&nbsp;</p>

To crouch down and look in his eyes again and ask him...and then I notice...no one else heard him. No one seems to notice that he even spoke to me. If they did they're not saying anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're all watching Lillian Rivera make her exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clasp my hands together, Old Jack hadn't hurt me, and yet I can still feel the gentle pressure where he'd touched me. And then I scoot on past him and back to my table. ""I'll take it to go please."" I tell the waitress, Tori, and pack my things.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'd eat at dad's afterall.&lt;/p&gt;

A brand new suburban neighbourhood it’s supposed to become, a late vinex project. But work has been delayed for months now. Graffiti adorns the concrete structures.

			<p>Exter came out of burn and entered a parking orbit. An ISA &nbsp;(Interstellar Space Agency) patrol ship scanned them, ran their ID and waved them on. Exeter had been keeping its nose clean for the last few years. On the bridge, calculations were made. They don’t have enough fuel for a touch down and dust off at the Ranch. Vandemberg Spaceport has added a surcharge, in addition to the already scandalous port fees that were negotiated after the war, to cover ‘clean up’ on Ares, the moon that served as an Alliance Naval Shipyard... but has since be ‘decommissioned.’</p><p>They’d have to travel by shuttle to the ranch, and then pick up some paying customers or cargo when it was time to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>(Assume a skeleton crew of ‘temp workers’ on Exter. Let me know if you want to keep any of them.. if so, write them up. But between Nika, Rina and thr others,, you don’t “need”anyone else to Keep Flyin).</p>

Tasks that needed finishing before she could leave were prioritized and tasks she couldn't finish before the arrival were parceled out to some of the hands. Larry and Nala were both good about rearranging tasks as needed.</p><p>Ranch work doesn't stop just because visitors are expected, though, and today was no exception. Nika released the horses from their stalls into the paddock and pulled on her gloves to begin tossing pitchforks full of hay into the feeding troughs. The water were full, thanks to Rina's jiggering of a constant fresh-water refreshing system. When she stepped into the paddock, it was to find Nate already out there doing the feed.</p><p>""You didn't need to do that,"" she told him with a smile.</p><p>He tossed the last bit into the bin and then leaned on his pitchfork, one hand on his hip. ""I know. But I needed to do <em>something</em>,"" he admitted. ""Are you planning on loading up as soon as they touch down?""</p><p>""I expect that we'll need to help make arrangements for cargo or passengers before we can head out. Probably be a couple days on the ground, just to arrange that... but I don't rightly know. None of us are exactly rich enough to keep her flyin' out of our own pockets."" Nika paused and then shot him a cheeky grin. ""Well... Kiera might be. But the rest of us ain't!""</p><p>""Ain't ain't a word,"" he teased back, tossing an arm around her shoulders as they walked back toward the barn. ""Ain't that what you're always tellin' all the kids?""</p><p>Laughing, she wrapped an arm around his waist, hooking her gloved fingers into a belt loop. She leaned her head against his shoulder briefly, matching her steps to his back into the barn. ""I do tell them that all the gorram time,"" she admits. ""It ain't stopped 'em yet.""</p><p>She leaned into the kiss he pressed to the top of her head. When he released her, with a quick swat to her derriere, Nika sent him a sassy grin. ""Meet you in Dancer's stall. Nala's goin' all-out on breakfast this mornin', since they'll be gettin' here in time to eat -- she hopes.""

          <p>Getting everyone together and moving was actually more work than the actual shuttle ride down to planet side was. <em>Guess I'm not as rusty as I thought.</em></p><p>The conversation on the ride down was full of talk of how good it would be to see everyone again. To get a chance to get on horseback again. To get fresh food rather than the fake stuff that they ate on a regular basis. Everyone, even Chris, knew they were there on serious business. But all the more reason to enjoy the moments beforehand, Ezekiel thought.</p><p>Nika had land outside the main ranch area set aside for shuttle landings. In fact, it was the same place he and Kiera had landed when Kiera had surprised Nika and Rina with Ezekiel's presence so many years ago. As the shuttle doors opened on the early morning darkness, Ezekiel leaned over to Kiera as they got ready to leave and said, ""At least this time, we let them know we were coming.""</p>

            <textarea class=""message-content-editor"">&lt;p&gt;Getting everyone together and moving was actually more work than the actual shuttle ride down to planet side was. &lt;em&gt;Guess I'm not as rusty as I thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation on the ride down was full of talk of how good it would be to see everyone again. To get a chance to get on horseback again. To get fresh food rather than the fake stuff that they ate on a regular basis. Everyone, even Chris, knew they were there on serious business. But all the more reason to enjoy the moments beforehand, Ezekiel thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nika had land outside the main ranch area set aside for shuttle landings. In fact, it was the same place he and Kiera had landed when Kiera had surprised Nika and Rina with Ezekiel's presence so many years ago. As the shuttle doors opened on the early morning darkness, Ezekiel leaned over to Kiera as they got ready to leave and said, ""At least this time, we let them know we were coming.""&lt;/p&gt;

          <p class=""MsoNormal"">Sleep came hard, granting Rina
only a shallow slumber that was easily broken. After waking yet again on the
shreds of a dream, she checked her watch: 04:50. Giving up, she threw back the
covers and dressed in the predawn darkness. There was one thing she needed and
right now, it might be the last time she'd get it. <br>
<br>
<em>Best I do it now. I won't have later.</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">She
paused on her way out to check on Gabe, cracking his bedroom door and peering
through. The light she kept burning in the main room showed her
enough: he was still asleep and would be fine. Nevertheless, she wrote him a
note and left it propped on the table on her way out the door. <br>
<br>
The air frosted with her breath as she stepped off for Joshua's grave. 15 years
of sunsets and sunrises, of greeting and releasing the day with him as much as
she could, meant that she knew the way without needing to watch her feet. The iron
gate swung silently under her hand on her arrival and she sat on his grave, her
back against the headstone, and cast her eyes toward the horizon. As was her
routine, Rina tipped her head back, stretched her legs before
her, spread her fingers on the ground beneath her, and began.<br>

shuttle it was. She'd heard it before.<br>
<br>
<em>They're here.</em><br>
<br>
She gave Joshua's headstone a final pat. Déjà vu was strong when she put the
graveyard at her back and went down the hill toward the LZ. Had it been 15
years since Ezekiel's first arrival to the ranch, pulling her away from his
brother where he lay? Rina shook her head. She was approaching the age where
the circles life ran to were starting to show themselves, where changes rung
only served to illustrate how some things would forever remain the same. Rina
tracked the shuttle's progress with a hand raised against the growing dawn and
steered herself to her house midway. She'd wake Gabe and join the reunion at
the main house when everyone got there.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">""Gabe,"" she called

A Rina hug was a more intense affair. He had found Rina did not do anything halfway and hugs were no exception to that rule.</p><p>Then he got to stand in front of his nephew who had sprouted what felt like a foot since the last time Ezekiel had seen him. Standing firmly on the border between childhood and manhood, Gabe was quickly growing into the adult he would soon become. Ezekiel remembered being a 14 (<em>or is it 15? had it been that long?) </em>year old boy and feeling uncomfortable with all the routines of the past and with things like giving relatives hugs. The Lord knew that he could see it in Chris.&nbsp;</p><p>So instead of giving a hug, Ezekiel extended forth his right hand. ""Gabriel, you are looking well."" Normally, he was Gabe to Ezekiel (and probably would be again), but something about seeing him again, older (and hopefully wiser) made Ezekiel lean towards using Gabriel.&nbsp;</p>

But she turned her attention to the more serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;""Beggar's Wave was pretty sparse too -- deliberately so. The text of what he sent is what bothered us. He was 'glad to hear we were having a party for Arden' and he'd join us at the planet for it. Signed, Beglan Shea, PhD. You know how he felt about that title,"" she replied, casting a glance at Kiera. ""So as much as I hate to drag everyone home for trouble... I think maybe we got some trouble.""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a slight shrug and she raises her coffee cup to drink from it. ""If it turns out to be nothin', that's all well and good. But... I got the prickle at the back of my neck that's saying he wouldn't have invoked Arden's name *and* his title if he weren't hip-deep in horse manure and needs help.""&lt;/p&gt;

          <p>Ezekiel looked directly at Gabriel, giving him his full attention. This was an adult request coming from his nephew. Gabe, much like Chris, currently straddled the space between child and adult. Ezekiel had been forced early on in his life to make the jump to adult faster, leaving his home behind before he was fifteen. But he felt he had been better off for it. If Gabe was adult enough to ask, then he was adult enough to come along.&nbsp;</p><p>""Gabriel, you are welcome aboard the Exeter. You and Chris can serve as stewards during the journey.""

            <textarea class=""message-content-editor"">&lt;p&gt;Ezekiel looked directly at Gabriel, giving him his full attention. This was an adult request coming from his nephew. Gabe, much like Chris, currently straddled the space between child and adult. Ezekiel had been forced early on in his life to make the jump to adult faster, leaving his home behind before he was fifteen. But he felt he had been better off for it. If Gabe was adult enough to ask, then he was adult enough to come along.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;""Gabriel, you are welcome aboard the Exeter. You and Chris can serve as stewards during the journey."" He then looked over to Rina. ""Assuming your mother gives her permission.""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paused for a second, considering the cat.

          <p>Elias finds some rationale to how the thing is constructed, even if he can't precisely figure out what each of the instruments do. It is clear the chamber was repurposed from something else and cobbled together with scraps and seemingly incongruent artifacts. It seems miraculously put together by a very advanced engineer, even if the parts are odd.</p><p>But after the confusion of it, the core parts can be identified. There is no way to plug in for a diagnostic, but the panel seems to use lights to communicate readings. Except for the yellow light, they are all green. Glyphs above the lights start to make sense. Inverted triangle perhaps means pressure, heart pulse perhaps means vital signs, cloud means air quality, and a star perhaps means temperature. If the assumption is correct, it's the temperature gauge that is yellow.</p><p>On the bridge, Sid's metapad confirms that the ship's data was uplinked to the <em>Promise </em>and provides a report:</p><p style=""margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">===================</span></p><p style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;""><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"">Status:

            <textarea class=""message-content-editor"">&lt;p&gt;Elias finds some rationale to how the thing is constructed, even if he can't precisely figure out what each of the instruments do. It is clear the chamber was repurposed from something else and cobbled together with scraps and seemingly incongruent artifacts. It seems miraculously put together by a very advanced engineer, even if the parts are odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the confusion of it, the core parts can be identified. There is no way to plug in for a diagnostic, but the panel seems to use lights to communicate readings. Except for the yellow light, they are all green. Glyphs above the lights start to make sense. Inverted triangle perhaps means pressure, heart pulse perhaps means vital signs, cloud means air quality, and a star perhaps means temperature. If the assumption is correct, it's the temperature gauge that is yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bridge, Sid's metapad confirms that the ship's data was uplinked to the &lt;em&gt;Promise &lt;/em&gt;and provides a report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=""margin-left: 40px;""&gt;&lt;span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);""&gt;===================&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: Calibri; margin-left: 40px;""&gt;&lt;span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125);""&gt;Status:

          <p><strong>Emily</strong>, <strong>Hannah</strong>, <strong>Elijah</strong>, and <strong>Stavros </strong>got home from worship at the Landis<strong> </strong>family home. <strong>Hermes Landis</strong> was not an actual ordained minister, but he was the closet thing Abundance had. Sadly Emily knew more of the Bible and had a better grasp of the inner meaning of most passages. Tonight Landis was trying to make a point about the parting of the Red Sea and how it was close to living in Abundance.</p><p>Emily and Elijah were in the kitchen, Hannah and Stavros in the home parlor, when&nbsp;<strong>Corinne </strong>arrived. It was quite late/dark by this time and past the children's normal bedtime.</p><p>Before Emily finished with Corinne, <strong>Calamity </strong>and <strong>Dune </strong>arrived. They were assisting a pant-less <strong>Harris </strong>(owner of the mining company). Harris had on shirt, vest and boots only.</p><hr><p>Questions:</p><p>Corinne: why are you visiting Emily at this late hour?</p><p>Emily: why is Stavros here so late?</p>

Sadly Emily knew more of the Bible and had a better grasp of the inner meaning of most passages. Tonight Landis was trying to make a point about the parting of the Red Sea and how it was close to living in Abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily and Elijah were in the kitchen, Hannah and Stavros in the home parlor, when&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Corinne &lt;/strong&gt;arrived. It was quite late/dark by this time and past the children's normal bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Emily finished with Corinne, &lt;strong&gt;Calamity &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Dune &lt;/strong&gt;arrived. They were assisting a pant-less &lt;strong&gt;Harris &lt;/strong&gt;(owner of the mining company). Harris had on shirt, vest and boots only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corinne: why are you visiting Emily at this late hour?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily: why is Stavros here so late?&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>The North stage is a platform raised about 6' off the ground raised atop a series of disparate scaffolding and risers held together by cross bars, lumber, screws, bolts, and cabling.&nbsp; The stage is about 50' across and 30' deep, has a series of dark tarps hung behind it tied down by twine and rope.&nbsp; Cross beams hang over the front of the stage with a dozen or so large lights set in silver metal half-spheres aiming towards the stage, though the lights do not appear to be emitting anything just now.&nbsp; Cables and lines run from the lights to the sides supporting the cross beams along both sides of the stage and towards the rear.</p><p>Standing on either side of the stage are some large black boxes with a fabric sort of covering in front of them.&nbsp; There are two large boxes on either side (about as tall as a man), with smaller boxes stacked atop of them.&nbsp; Wires run from these to the sides of the stage and then back out of view just as with the lights.</p><p>It is afternoon and a 5 piece band of young adults (2 girls, 3 men) has just concluded playing on the stage and departed.&nbsp; They were announced as <strong><em>Three Plus Two</em></strong> ... or, at least, the loud fellow in the red suit had said that was the name of the group.&nbsp; The lead singer is a gregarious woman who seems to have captivated many in the crowd with her pleasing combination of pleasant bluesy lyrics with a jazzy lilt.&nbsp; The music is not acoustic.&nbsp; That is, the sound is coming from the cabled boxes to either side of the stage.&nbsp; Liquid fuel powered generators chug in the background, and the sound of the music and the voices are propelled loudly from the speakers which hiss and pop with the sound.&nbsp; (Note that electronic devices are the exception, rather than the rule, as the knowledge of how to power and run electronics is a skill that has largely fallen from the realm of common knowledge.)</p><p>On the street before the stage there must be more than two hundred people.&nbsp; They are seated on makeshift chairs and stools, blankets and sheets, and standing.&nbsp; The crowd nods, bobs, and moves to the sound of the music in the warm spring sun.&nbsp;</p><p>Vendors carrying boxes of wares stroll among the gathered waiting spectators hawking food items, hats, clothing, jewelry, spinners made of metal and light wood, and many other trinkets of amusement.&nbsp; Barter or jingle is good for most items.</p>

          <p class=""MsoNormal"">People. So
many people.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Nibbling
pensively on her nether lip, Coda scurries her way through the crowd, wondering
how they manage to move, to breathe, to think, while surrounded by such an
agitation. When she’s on stage, she can manage that: she even appreciates it,
the waves of a hundred pulses dispersed into the air and ground, rhythmed. But without
the distance, and the unreal feeling of power that accompanies her performances…
well, she feels just what she is: one frail, clumsy stranger, lost in a crowd full
of people, with no clue of what she is, that barely notice she’s there at all.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">She’s
alone, for now. She prefers that, when she’s running Nero’s errands: having Ba,
Rotschild and the whole wolfpack around her to a casual meeting was as
ridiculous as bringing a flamethrower to do groceries. Too unsubtle. Too
lethal. Not a good idea.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The job in itself
is pretty straightforward: she must simply carry a small black package to a
given stall, near the North Stage. <em>Can’t miss
it</em>, he said<em>, they sell jewels
and all that fancy shit. Go there, and ask for Holloway. Tall gal, gray eyes, lacks
two fingers. She'll let you inside her place, if you say who sends you. Give her the box, tell her that she needs to come tonight, listen
well if she has somethin’ to say, and get the hell out of here. </em>He
averted his eyes for a moment, exhaling a long trail of smoke (she didn’t where
he managed to find cigarettes: those were so expensive these days). <em>I don’t care what you do afterwards, but you
better get your ass back here before nine. We need to impress them tonight. </em>And with that, he dismissed her.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">She looked
inside the package before leaving, of course (he didn’t forbid her to do so, after
all). Inside, she found two things: a dozen of little glass phials, each full
of a translucent, thick-looking blue liquid, and a small envelope, sealed shut
with black tape.&nbsp;She hadn’t opened either
– couldn’t bring herself to. She knows Nero wouldn’t like it, and even though
his sway over her has been steadily decreasing over the course of the last days,
she still feels her stomach churn at the mere idea of disappointing him.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">It could be
just a drug thing. That wouldn’t be suprising: from what she gathered (mostly
from Rotschild, a fervent consumer), the abandoned building where Nero
installed the <em>Smotherland </em>was a well-known
drug hub way before they arrived, and Nero being the greedy bastard that he is
(<em>but in a good way</em>, she can’t keep
herself from mentally adding), he gladly took part in their new neighbors’ business,
selling drugs to the party-goers to accompany the shows. Now that he's on the
leave, he's maybe trying to placate them with a gift – or to get rid of a troublesome product. But if that’s the case, it doesn’t make
much sense to send <em>her, </em>and not someone
already involved in that business already. Like Rotschild, for example. Or Giuliana.
Or Cayd. Or Reever. Or pretty much any one of Nero’s thugs.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps foolishly, that makes her hope. Hope that this Holloway, whoever she is, may be someone like her. Someone… different. She hadn’t have much luck finding answers

many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;Nibbling
pensively on her nether lip, Coda scurries her way through the crowd, wondering
how they manage to move, to breathe, to think, while surrounded by such an
agitation. When she’s on stage, she can manage that: she even appreciates it,
the waves of a hundred pulses dispersed into the air and ground, rhythmed. But without
the distance, and the unreal feeling of power that accompanies her performances…
well, she feels just what she is: one frail, clumsy stranger, lost in a crowd full
of people, with no clue of what she is, that barely notice she’s there at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;She’s
alone, for now. She prefers that, when she’s running Nero’s errands: having Ba,
Rotschild and the whole wolfpack around her to a casual meeting was as
ridiculous as bringing a flamethrower to do groceries. Too unsubtle. Too
lethal. Not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;The job in itself
is pretty straightforward: she must simply carry a small black package to a
given stall, near the North Stage. &lt;em&gt;Can’t miss
it&lt;/em&gt;, he said&lt;em&gt;, they sell jewels
and all that fancy shit. Go there, and ask for Holloway. Tall gal, gray eyes, lacks
two fingers. She'll let you inside her place, if you say who sends you. Give her the box, tell her that she needs to come tonight, listen
well if she has somethin’ to say, and get the hell out of here. &lt;/em&gt;He
averted his eyes for a moment, exhaling a long trail of smoke (she didn’t where
he managed to find cigarettes: those were so expensive these days). &lt;em&gt;I don’t care what you do afterwards, but you
better get your ass back here before nine. We need to impress them tonight. &lt;/em&gt;And with that, he dismissed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;She looked
inside the package before leaving, of course (he didn’t forbid her to do so, after
all). Inside, she found two things: a dozen of little glass phials, each full
of a translucent, thick-looking blue liquid, and a small envelope, sealed shut
with black tape.&nbsp;She hadn’t opened either
– couldn’t bring herself to. She knows Nero wouldn’t like it, and even though
his sway over her has been steadily decreasing over the course of the last days,
she still feels her stomach churn at the mere idea of disappointing him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;It could be
just a drug thing. That wouldn’t be suprising: from what she gathered (mostly
from Rotschild, a fervent consumer), the abandoned building where Nero
installed the &lt;em&gt;Smotherland &lt;/em&gt;was a well-known
drug hub way before they arrived, and Nero being the greedy bastard that he is
(&lt;em&gt;but in a good way&lt;/em&gt;, she can’t keep
herself from mentally adding), he gladly took part in their new neighbors’ business,
selling drugs to the party-goers to accompany the shows. Now that he's on the
leave, he's maybe trying to placate them with a gift – or to get rid of a troublesome product. But if that’s the case, it doesn’t make
much sense to send &lt;em&gt;her, &lt;/em&gt;and not someone
already involved in that business already. Like Rotschild, for example. Or Giuliana.
Or Cayd. Or Reever. Or pretty much any one of Nero’s thugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;Perhaps foolishly, that makes her hope. Hope that this Holloway, whoever she is, may be someone like her. Someone… different. She hadn’t have much luck finding answers
in Bell Town, and perhaps Nero purposefully sent her where she could finally quench
her thirst for explanations. Highely unlikely, given how self-interested the
guy was, but eh, a girl can dream, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;And so, she
dreams, lost amidst the revelers, squinting her eyes while looking for a stall with jewels on it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <p>Coda nods
calmly. Enhancing perceptions? Tapping in an unseen force? That speaks to her. What this
woman calls “tapestry” must be her own metaphor for the Song, visual where
Coda’s understanding is musical. Interesting.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">She intends
to ask more questions, but her breath catches in her throat as Holloway
uncovers the string of pearls. All cautiousness lost, she hastily pulls her
stool closer to the woman, slightly stumbling in the maneuver. Fascinated, she reaches
for it with both her hands, and raises it to the light over the nacreous sheen
of the beans. The bracelet is perfect – it will hook the attention of the
audience right away by sheer beauty alone, not to speak of the properties that
Holloway alleges it has. The blue line that runs across the pearls… it’s almost
like the one that shines in the Skull’s cavity. What other wonders could she
find in that store?</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">She’s a bit
taken aback when Holloway states her price. Reading her? The last time she had
undergone that kind of scrutiny, it was performed by some brainer, back in
Denny. The guy had stared into her eyes for two full hours, and then avoided
her like plague for the remainder of her stay.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>“Alright.” </strong>she ends up saying, in a hushed voice. <strong>“I think I will settle with this one for
now.”</strong> With a luxury of precaution, she folds around her left arm, and clasp
it around her wrist.&nbsp; <strong>“As for that, uh… reading. If it’s gonna
take long, maybe it’d be better if we waited. Nero will flay me alive if I
don’t show up in time for the show. To which you’re invited, by the way. That’s
why I was sent me here in the first place.”, </strong>she adds with a awkward smile.<strong> “Maybe we could meet up there, after the

not. She won’t fidget away. If anything, that’s an occasion to learn more about
how Holloway’s abilities function, and how they differ from Coda’s own. And so,

you prefer to do it now…” </strong>She takes a deep breath, steels herself, and

I need to catch the audience attention, so let's go dramatic. I'll need red dye for my hair, and a new dress. Black.&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bustier would be nice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b style=""background-color: initial;""&gt;"" &lt;/b&gt;She nonchalantly flicks her wrist, so that Holloway's bracelet catch the light and sparkle. &lt;b style=""background-color: initial;""&gt;""Show my bare arms, y'know.""&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finger joins the first.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""Second. No fighting during my song. If I have to yell, we risk much, and I don't want that. And if someone dares bring trouble near my stage, I'll have no choice but to defend myself. With a song."" &lt;/strong&gt;Oh, how she's proud of her tone, right one - just detached enough to be threatening, without becoming fully cliché.&nbsp;""&lt;b style=""background-color: initial;""&gt;And not a pretty one.""&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lets that sink in a few seconds, then raises a third finger.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""Third...""&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the big one.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She really wants to perform Holloway's melody: she owes her that. However, without the lyrics, there's only so much she can do. Nero has been very clear about what he wants: she knows exactly what piece he intends her to perform, and she can't fuel two songs at once. She has only one voice, after all.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as always with her gift, there's a loophole.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a band accompanies her, they can take on Holloway's melody. She'll sing her own composition on top, and adjust her own accords to the band's music. She never tried it, but she's certain it could work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for that, she needs mundane musicians, melodies whose only magic comes from sheer artistry and dedication. And from what she gathered today on the streets, there's only one group that can provide her with what she needs.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""I'll sing the song you want at the end of the set, when everybody will be focused on me: that'll give you enough time to figure who you want in or not in the room at this point.&nbsp; But there's no chance I go in &lt;em&gt;a capella&lt;/em&gt;. If we do something this big, I want a band. Scratch that: I want the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; band.""&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She slowly articulates, to be sure he understands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""I want Three Plus Two.""&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<div class=""rp-story"">
			<p>What takes 30 minutes, turns into an hour as a group of people surround the outside of Mrs. Bentely's house as they seem upset about what had transpired. Just as you begin to hear police siren's, the sound is subsided by the sound of some black vans and some trucks moving around the building as men in black suits and uniform begin to push the crowd away. A black Sedan moves in on the road towards the incoming fuzz' car as you all see it is none other than Agent Red talking to the officer, as he flashes his own badge and waves the officer woman away. Soon enough a base is set up within the house with some security along with medical support to over look the party of their wounds and take Asha and Lucy for some needed medical care along with the others.</p>

			<p>Make a post for your feeding attempt. I will keep the top most post (this one) updated with the stats I use for your rolls (so you can verify that all bonuses get in). I will do a single post response if the feeding attempt ""just resolves"". if it results in a scene, I'll create it and we can proceed from there. Reminder: You just describe your plan of feeding and I'll make a roll for you, using a different RPG system with custom dice.&nbsp;</p><p>East Passyunk Social Difficulty 3</p><p>Presence 4</p><p>Socialize 3</p><p>Persuasion 2</p><p>Feeding Grounds +2</p><p>Lash Out +4 -1&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The house had two rooms, more or less. The door led into the main room, reeking with smoke from the hearthfire burning in a pit in the center. The lack of proper building materials (and time and energy for construction, for that matter) meant the houses were assembled, like this one, cheaply, hastily, from whatever could be scavenged. Back home, the Red Folk had long ago mastered the trick of building proper flues, that evacuated smoke without letting in cold and wet.

The oil, for instance, is made from a flower that used to grow back home, although of course it doesn't any more.

Some of the feelings make sense, though they rise spontaneously out of nowhere. Gitta comes to mind, and she wants to cry. That makes her think of the Eyes, and she's mad. But the emotions become more strange, and more powerful, as the spell advances. She thinks of Oppida and feels sad; she watches Afren, watching dutifully over his daughter, and feels afraid. She thinks of the man who came for her mother the other night and feels a strange, unnatural sense of euphoria.</p><p>Strong feelings, even strange feelings, are always a part of casting.

			<p><strong>Panel 1: </strong>The scene is from the end of Issue #5, next to Morales' Warehouse and docks on Sedgewick Street in Red Hook. Long shot of TEMPUS and LI FENG on a foggy night-time rooftop as they survey the black sedans of the SI-FAN below. The cargo ship <em>Heavenly Pearl</em> can barely be seen through the fog, docked and with gangplank down.</p><p><strong><em>SWEETS</em></strong> (off-panel, through two-way radio): ""The crew - they're all <em>dead,</em> but they're still <em>standin'</em> here!""</p><p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> LI FENG, crouching, watches the unfolding action below with an intense glare. TEMPUS is just behind her.</p><p><strong><em>LI FENG:</em></strong> <em>Bao Cheng-ho</em> -- he is <em>here!</em></p><p><strong><em>TEMPUS:</em></strong> That's my cue...</p><p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> Extreme close-up of TEMPUS' temporal field regulator sparking with a strange electromagnetic energy.</p><p><strong><em>SOUND EFFECT:</em></strong> <em>ka</em>-<em>KRAKKK!</em></p><p><strong>Panel 4: </strong>A bright blue flash, casting TEMPUS in a Kirby-esque psychedelic silhouette. LI FENG is semi-transparent against him as she turns half-way toward him, shielding her eyes from the flash.</p><p><strong><em>LI FENG:</em></strong><em> What is -- ?!</em></p><p><strong>Panel 5:</strong> TEMPUS is in the same pose as Panel Two, but his surroundings have changed. He stands in what looks like a concrete basement with pockmarked, unadorned cement walls. A metal janitor's bucket and mop stand in the corner, shrouded in spiderwebs and dust. The only light, aside from that generated by his temporal control harness, is dim red light shed by a caged emergency light bulb mounted in a nearby corridor.&nbsp;</p><p>A metal ladder descends from the top of that corridor, going down into the darkness of the shaft below. A sign mounted next to it reads AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT.&nbsp;</p><p>The corridor also extends further into the darkness, turning a hard 90-degree corner toward the right. Another sign hangs on the wall at that corner beneath another caged light bulb, only this one isn't lit. This sign reads BOMB SHELTER, with an arrow pointing down the hall toward the right.</p><p>No one else appears to be present. It is cold and quiet, save for a distant, echoing dripping sound.</p>

          <p>Scaling the ladder, Sebastian climbs up through the open shaft. By the cool air that blows in, he can tell it leads to the outdoors; artificial light shines down from what appears to be an open booth built atop the shaft. It seems like a cylindrical phone booth, only it has no door or phone. Outside the booth is night sky, but due to light pollution and slight cloud cover few stars are visible. Immediately surrounding the booth is an industrial-looking neighborhood, with cranes, silos, and chain-link fences defining its character.</p><p>A roaring sound echoes overhead, as though the sky were being rent in two. A massive aircraft soars through the night sky, with wings swept back at a 45-degree angle and what appear to be rockets mounted under each wing. However, the rockets have no visible exhaust. It reminds him of prototype designs he's seen in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> for turbojets, which would be consistent with what he's seeing. But he's never seen a working model before, and this jet-powered plane would rival the size of a Boeing 314 Clipper.</p><p>The enormous jet plane descends, its landing gear extending, and as Sebastian peeks over the rim of the shaft, he sees a city skyline drastically different from the one he was looking at moments before. The skyscrapers which define the skyline are stark, unadorned concrete monoliths, with some lesser buildings seemingly made mostly of glass. Gone are the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Skylights wave across the cloudy sky. The floor of the city is elevated from the channel, lined with towering dyke walls, though there are numerous ships docked at their base. Much smaller flying craft with mounted searchlights swarm the harbor like fireflies.</p><p>It takes a moment's observation, but it begins to dawn on Sebastian that his vantage point is the same as it was before the bright blue flash engulfed him. He is in Red Hook, looking out at Manhattan Island - but it's no Manhattan he's ever been in before.</p><p>A glance to the west, beyond Governor's Island, confirms this. Where once the towering green-tinted spectacle of the Statue of Liberty stood, holding her torch aloft to welcome weary immigrants arriving from overseas, now there is a statue of a stern woman holding a banner topped by a double-headed eagle, giving a Roman salute toward the east.</p>

Rolls-Royce Phantom that stopped in front of the burnt-out pub fitted about as
well into this part of the City as the two broad-shouldered, rough-looking men on
the front seats fitted into a car like this, despite their tailor-made suits.
Despite that, none of the few passers-by bothered with a closer look. The men
didn't look like they would appreciate curiosity.<br>
The passenger got out and slowly turned on the spot, sending a glower in every
direction before stepping up to the rear compartment with its toned windows and
opening the door.</p>

dressed as elegant as ever, wearing a dark blazer and skirt that all but
screamed 'Big Business'. She headed for the entry of Nell's without a glance
back as the man closed the door behind her. He took one step after her,
obviously used to looming behind her, but then stopped and got back into the
car. <br>
Noone followed the boss into Nell's, ever. Instead, the two goons drove off to
park somewhere less obvious, the passenger glowering at a young woman on the
side-walk who was heading the other way...</p>

          <p class=""MsoNormal"">Catching
the bottle of bourbon, Maura raised it in a slight salute to Johnny. &nbsp;As long as everyone was on the same page she
was not opposed to trading favours against favours. Eventually the day might
come that the Tongs would be more trouble than they were worth, and she and Old
Liu would end up squaring up. But for now that was a rather distant future –
she still had some old enemies left to deal with before she could go and make
new ones.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">While the
Marshall asked his questions, Maura stepped around the bar in search for a
glass to drink the bourbon from, and exchanged a few silent gestures with Max
on whether or not he too would like one. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sitting
down on her table again she filled her glass (and Max’, if he had requested
one), and continued to observe the conversation. Honestly, if it were not for
the involvement of Old Liu, Maura would have already dismissed all of this as
simply a grieving mother unable to face the truth.<br>
But so…</p>

She asked Maximus in a murmur, not wanting to draw attention for now. The woman
was obviously opening up to Johnny, and he was asking all the right questions.
Which left her to wonder what to do. Had it been a violent murder, she could
have stretched out her underworld feelers, or drummed it up as a charity case
with her public personality – a rousing speech against crime on some occasion,
combined with a plea to the people to step forward and share anything useful
they might now with the police.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">But with
what seemed to be so obvious a suicide case… She could try to get a copy of the
police report, but it would take time and resources to do so, and in any case
Johnny would likely be able to achieve the same thing faster and with less of a
hassle. But were mundane approaches failed, others might yield success.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, best
wait for Max’ input. He was as good as her at sniffing out falsehoods, if not
better. The mother might not lie by conscious choice, but denial was a powerful
thing.</p>

          <p>Johnny wrapped up his questioning of Ms. Chen, taking care to get the workhorse information the Circle would need: the school that Emily attended, the names of the teacher running the drama club and Emily's friends in that club, and similar.

The money can be easily returned but any doubts the other midwives have in me is hard to wipe away. I think we can both agree more compromises to ministers is something we would like to avoid. Now then Magister, what would you ask of this minister of yours?""&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>One of the first things Stone-Parting-River does after going on a tour of the fascinating area called the Dojo is hit the books.&nbsp; Stone, very much aware of the glaring disadvantage he is currently at, is determined to puzzle out learning Old realm to the near exclusion of everything else the first few weeks his time here.&nbsp; Stone will not rely on someone else to do something as simple as read a sign.</p><p>Retracing his steps, he finds himself in the library.&nbsp; Like everything else he has seen in this fascinating and yet slightly terrifying place, it is grandiose beyond anything he has experienced.&nbsp; Stacks of scrolls and bound books nearly beyond sight both outward and upward, and for some reason spiralling downward as well.&nbsp; Beams of light meandering around, lighting for those within researching some topic or another.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was little in the way of recognisable organization and direction for Stone.&nbsp; What may be gods or spirits flitted about, or they could just be sentient sheets of paper for all Stone knows about this place.&nbsp; Stone begins to wander about, looking for something resembling a Librarian or information desk to get some direction - and hope they understand a more mortal tonuge .</p>

			<p>The invitation, in the charcoal grey envelope of central court, arrived at night when the household - bar Sir Ian Grenville, busy cooking the books - were sleeping. Slipped beneath the door, like a wisp of fog, but with greater import.</p><p>The next morning it was laid before Ian's place at the breakfast table, with the other post. But it almost made him choke on his eggs - for within the envelope was a note from the king's personal servant.</p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>Sir Ian,</em></p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;""><em>You are invited to attend interview with his Imperial Majesty, King Brynn-av-Alice.</em></p><p>Instructions for attendance, including a request to come without others, followed - and finally, a date and time.</p><p>He had barely time to finish breakfast - but it would not do to keep the king waiting.</p><p>A dash through the streets to the citadel, and, showing his invitation at every gate, it was not long before Sir Ian stood before the great grey doors of the king's reception room. Doors through which he had never been; doors which, in truth, he never expected to enter.</p><p>He knocked loudly, three times, as instructed.</p>

          <p>Despite the short notice, Ian had taken precious time to dress for the occasion. High fashion for the Dunmothian gentleman was by and large a sober affair of blacks, greys and crisp whites, with here and there a hint of color afforded by a sash or cravat. The one exception to this rule was that men who had served were permitted to wear their regimental dress uniforms on formal occasions. Before dashing out to meet the boy king, Sir Ian had availed himself of this privilege.&nbsp;</p><p>Now he stood before the doors to the royal audience chamber with his lean frame clad in the salmon and canary velvet of the Queen's Second Colonial Hussars-- the Dawn Regiment, so named for having been stationed at the farthest eastern reaches of the empire. Bright golden thread lined his doublet and the seams of his trousers; his riding boots were like polished onyx. After some consideration, he had girded his dress saber as well. A boy, he reasoned-- even a royal one-- might be taken with such things.&nbsp;</p><p>When the doors opened to admit him, Sir Ian swept impetuously to the center of the chamber like some exotic bird. Once there, he dropped a bow so deep that his greying hair brushed the polished granite beneath his soles.&nbsp;</p><p>""Your majesty,"" he declared, with eyes averted, ""Sir Ian Grenville-- ever a servant to Dunmouth-av-Alice and her crown-- hastens to obey your summons.""

          <p>The chamber was indeed opulent, but not entirely as Sir Ian had imagined. Already intimately acquainted with the polished marble floor, the stonework extends almost seamlessly from floor to ceiling, but changing at the boundary of floor and wall into a black onyx which Grenville would recognise from his sejourns in the Western Mountains, where such stone would be left in the wake of Anu'u.</p><p>The walls too were adorned with the eighteen banners of the provinces, eight of which flanked each of the left and right walls, and two of which were behind the throne dais in front of him. Grenville's eyes are drawn to these: on the right, the long grey banner of Dunsmouth-av-Alice, adorned with the city symbols; and to the left, the mahogany banner of the Red Mountain province. Unusual placement, Sir Ian would note, as this was the most recent acquisition in the imperial campaigns.</p><p>If his eyes managed to stray to the ceiling, they are vaulted and high, affording thick, deep shadows in whatever balconies and lofts might cut into the stone depths. They are carved from the sandstone taken from the uplands of Dunmouths's own province.</p><p>Sir Ian knows that there are large windows in the recesses of this room, but they admit no light today, being covered with luxuriant thick drapery which must be imported from one of the southern merchant cities, the style being unfamiliar to him. This again would attract comment, were this fact to be known outside of this room, for it suggests infealty to the Shepherdesses of Amberley province, who tirelessly and ceaselessly produce fine wool for the production of soft furnishing. Indeed, the interdiction demanding that courtiers dress entirely in woolen clothing and furnish their house with Amberley wools had only recently been lifted.&nbsp;Instead, the room is lit by large candelabras which hang suspended by ropes unseen from the vaulted ceilings; light is cast in small pools in this manner, such as the one occupied by Sir Ian himself, and those illuminating the banners of the provinces.</p><p>Another pool of light is ahead, and is by far the largest, although perhaps not the brightest. Its yellow light illuminates the throne dais, which contains the three wooden thrones of state, arrange in a loose arc. In the best of times, these thrones would hold the reigning monarch, their spouse, and their named heir. Today, and presumably throughout this epoch, only one throne is occupied. It would be assumed that the monarch would sit in the central throne, but this is not the case, and instead the Boy-King sits in the left-hand throne, that of the named heir, slouching and leaning in that way common to most teenagers, despite that the Boy-King is in fact 17 years old, and shortly to come of age.</p><p>He is dressed not in the regal clothes of state, but in fashionable but sombre mourning robes - still, after all this time, missing his mother.</p><p>""Sir Ian Grenville,"" he shouts, from the other side of the room. The sound echoes around for a few moments, then is deadened by the thick curtains.

Standing tall in their ceremonial armour, clasping pikes, they step into the central aisle of the room, turn towards the door, and march out in synchronous time. A few other figures, for the most part servants, join the parade at the back. The guardsmen look forth, through and past Sir Ian, as they go by; the servants look down, not meeting his eye. Only one, a woman in a dark cloak, looks up as she passes. Was that a smile, a smirk? It's hard to tell in the gloom.</p><p>""Step forth, Sir Ian,"" the Boy-King says, more quietly, as the heavy doors slam shut behind him.

          <p>From the corner of his eye, Sir Ian watches the young king's courtiers depart. How should he respond to Brynn-av-Alice's challenge?&nbsp; Not that the true culprit in the embezzlement was the matronly Lady Wilhelmina Grives. Such a tale might serve to impeach her testimony in a court of law, but was not tuned to please the ear of a boy-- a young man, Ian supposes-- still awkwardly mourning the death of his mother. No, it would have to be something else. But what?</p><p>Grenville slowly approaches the dais, making a show of straightening one gilded cuff. <em>Speak, man, </em>he urges himself. <em>Chin up and speak. </em>Any courtier worth his snuff could give a reason why his own dignity should not be besmirched.&nbsp;</p><p>Ian would give the child two.&nbsp;</p><p>""Two reasons, your majesty,"" he says. Sir Ian raises his head high enough to look down his rather prominent nose at the lounging monarch. ""First, because I have committed no crime. If I have drained the jeweled goblet of the Queen's Haven Charitable Society, it was only in order to fill the humble cup of the Eastland refugees. That is more, I fear, than can be said for many of my fellow directors, who are concerned mainly to add more jewels to the goblet. But all this by the by. Second--""</p><p><em>The second reason. The second reason--</em></p><p>Images flash before Grenville's frantic mind: the Red Mountain banner hung close by the throne; the cloaked lady, smiling as she passes; Brynn and Ian alone, in the first private audience ever granted to him despite years of service to the crown.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Ian delicately clears his throat. ""Second,"" he proceeds, feeling his way, ""if it should chance that your majesty has an... interest, in the Eastern tribesfolk who now dwell among us, there is no one better positioned to be informative and useful to the crown than I. Nor anyone, I may add, with more fruitful and-- for lack of a better term, varied-- connections in Queen's Haven.""</p><p>A dangerous game, this. Ian forces himself to inhale and exhale slowly, to meet the boy king's eyes without fear in his own.&nbsp;</p>

""Second,"" he proceeds, feeling his way, ""if it should chance that your majesty has an... interest, in the Eastern tribesfolk who now dwell among us, there is no one better positioned to be informative and useful to the crown than I. Nor anyone, I may add, with more fruitful and-- for lack of a better term, varied-- connections in Queen's Haven.""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dangerous game, this. Ian forces himself to inhale and exhale slowly, to meet the boy king's eyes without fear in his own.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          <p>Brynn waves his left hand dismissively as the man before him outlines his first excuse; with the second, he narrows his eyes, and his other hand grips the armrest of his throne more tightly.</p><p>""You,"" he says, with a little mirth, a little malice. ""You dain to wonder what the interests of a <em>king</em>&nbsp;might be? What might be my concerns, my follies, my worries? I,"" he repeats, jabbing his left forefinger down on its respective armrest. ""I am concerned for the wellbeing of my court, my city, my country. And that my mother's memory is preserved.""</p><p>An odd point to make - quite a juxtaposition from the others. Balancing the memory of one dead monarch with the future preservation of the people and politicians of the entire kingdom. Perhaps in the eyes of the Boy-King, the two issues are entwined, but it is not how the threatened populous feel.</p><p>""I am not concerned with the particulars of your trial, Sir Grenville. You can be royally excused - did you know that? - on whatever grounds I see fit."" Brynn is clearly agitated, and annoyed, but the reason isn't entirely clear. ""You are <em>right</em>, I suppose, in that I am interested in the Eastern tribesfolk. And you are <em>correct</em>&nbsp;that I have summoned you here as one with particular knowledge and experience. I understand you were a colonial agent in the Red Mountains, and of course your position now is well-known - and appreciated by - the court and myself.""</p><p>""I would greatly value your insight and advice, Sir Ian Grenville, but I cannot employ you if you are imprisoned, innocent or otherwise.

So, you see, you would have to be working towards an aim which the Court would find acceptable.""</p><p>""Let me be candid with you, Sir Grenville - and should any of this reach external ears, yours shall be removed."" This threat of gruesome violence is rather glossed over as the boy-king continues at full pelt. ""The Regent does not see me as a suitable monarch, child or not. Tradition states that I would reach the age of majority at 16, but this was bypassed, and now I must wait until I am 18 to rule. I have no reason to believe, and plenty of hearsay to imply, that they will delay this further, until I am 21. What's to say they do not castrate me further, and deny me the right to rule until I am 25, 30, one hundred years old?""</p><p>Brynn maintains a cool composure, but his voice is quaking with barely restrained anger. ""This is unacceptable, Sir Grenville, and it snubs my mother, who is not here to defend herself. She would not see her heir treated like this. And so, little pawn, you and I must hatch a cunning plan. How can we make the regent see that I am an adult and a suitable monarch who must be treated with respect?""</p><p>The question hangs in the air like a poison dart.</p>

          <p>Contemplating the young king's challenge, Ian is reminded of an adage he learned from his fellow colonial officers in the Red Mountains.&nbsp; <em>A clock has many moving parts; a dagger none.</em>&nbsp;Simple violence has few points of failure.&nbsp; The natives might accuse the Dawn Regiment of brutality when a thief's hand was crushed by a hammer, or when one of the Red Folk's more vocal medicine women disappeared only to turn up as a battered corpse between the corn rows.&nbsp; But there was very little theft in colonial Eastland.&nbsp; And the malcontents were careful to whisper.</p><p>If the Lord Regent stood between Brynn-av-Alice and genuine rule, then the direct course would be through the Regent's gut.&nbsp; A dead man wields no veto.&nbsp; But surely this option would have occurred to Brynn, and the Lord Regent-- whether through the boy king's fear, principle or self-restraint-- still drew breath.&nbsp; It would be capital treason for Sir Ian even to voice such a suggestion.&nbsp; Did he dare place himself so entirely in this child's trembling hands?</p><p>Such dark thoughts play across Grenville's features: a sullen brow, followed by a pained wrinkling of the nose.&nbsp; He turns away from the dais and paces the room, hands clasped behind his waist, his trim body mirrored in marble.&nbsp; No, he would not suggest an assassination.&nbsp; Ian had already thrown the dice once in this interview; to do so again, and at such high stakes, would be madness.</p><p>Brynn-av-Alice wasn't a killer, however he might fancy himself.&nbsp; Ian is reminded of the Dunmothians who came to the Red Mountains on holiday, imagining themselves to be great hunters.&nbsp; Grenville would have the natives trap and hobble some bear or mountain cat, then drive the poor creature down to the hunting party so that the visiting dignitaries could enjoy all the thrill of the kill with none of the danger.&nbsp; That's what the boy king needs: a guaranteed victory, with no personal risk.</p><p>""If your majesty will indulge me,"" Ian says, speaking slowly and pacing as he speaks.&nbsp; ""What you require is a signal triumph of policy, one where your view carries the day against the Lord Regent's advice and before all the world.""&nbsp; Sir Ian pauses, spreads his palms parallel to the floor as if preparing to play the invisible instrument of state.</p><p>""I will withdraw from the board of the Queen's Haven Charitable Society during the pendency of my trial.&nbsp; I shall have it reported that this was at the private request of the Lord Regent; he may deny it if he likes, but the scribblers will scribble and the talkers will talk.&nbsp; Meanwhile, do you let it be known that you oppose my removal from the board, and suspect some mischief in the whole legal proceeding against me.""</p><p>Grenville flexes and spreads his fingers over the phantom keys of his machination.&nbsp; ""I have... reason to believe, that once I am down there will be unrest in Queen's Haven and the neighboring boroughs.""&nbsp; His 'friends' among the Eastlanders will make it so, or so Ian prays.&nbsp; ""Acts of vandalism, a few of violence.&nbsp; Defacements of property, with scrawls against the crown and mutterings upon government's miserliness towards the poor refugees.""</p><p>""Here your majesty emerges once more,"" Ian declares, wheeling back sharply to face the thrones.&nbsp; He seeks and holds the young monarch's gaze, his own bright with the assumed excitement of this moment.&nbsp; ""You deride the Charitable Society for its corruption and mismanagement, and the unrest they have fomented.&nbsp; You declare that I am free of the charges falsely leveled against me by these venal and self-dealing persons.&nbsp; At a stroke, you dissolve the board-- as you may, for the society exists under a charter granted by your royal mother of late memory.&nbsp; In its place, you install your good servant-- myself-- as sole director.""</p><p>Ian allows himself the twitch of a smile.</p><p>""Henceforward the floodgates of civic generosity are opened.&nbsp; The Charitable Society performs signal good works among the refugee community.&nbsp; The unrest, I make bold to assure you, vanishes as if it never was. And all credit for having put down this burgeoning calamity in Dunmouth goes to your majesty's wisdom alone, in defiance of the bad advice and guidance of the Lord Regent.""</p><p>Grenville draws a deep breath after his speech.&nbsp; ""After such a public victory, the Lord Regent would be hard pressed to veto a declaration of your majesty's majority,"" he concludes.&nbsp; Standing once more before the king's dais, Ian studies the boy's expression for his reaction.</p>

Brynn's voice drips faux sincerity.&nbsp; ""'This power, your majesty, this office, this preferment, is to be placed entirely at your disposal.&nbsp; Not for myself-- not for myself, your majesty-- do I take up this honor, but for &lt;em&gt;you.'""&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian grits his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;""Do you think me dense, Ian Grenville?"" the monarch snaps.&nbsp; ""Do you think that I have lived from my birth amongst hangers-on like yourself, amongst vines that entwine the royal trunk only so that they may climb to the light, and cannot feel their coils?""&nbsp; His voice rises with each sentence, bounding back from the distant, marble walls.&nbsp; ""You would dare to use me-- to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;me-- in settling your own scores, putting down your own rivals?!&nbsp; Have I shown you some, some--- &lt;em&gt;weakness &lt;/em&gt;that you make bold to exploit?""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last thought seems to infuriate the youth; the muscles around his mouth spasm, and his knuckles whiten on the arm of his throne.&nbsp; ""No sir,"" Brynn-av-Alice spits.&nbsp; ""No.&nbsp; You claim that you will be the scalpel to cut out a cancer in Queen's Haven; but &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;are the cancer, Grenville.&nbsp; And I will cut you out.""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king draws a shuddering breath, then plunges on, ""Henceforth you are removed from the board of the Queen's Haven Charitable Society.&nbsp; Do not think to show your face there, and do not &lt;em&gt;dream &lt;/em&gt;to show it here at court.&nbsp; I will see you tried to fullest extent of the law, sir, and when you are convicted for your embezzlement-- I say &lt;em&gt;when, &lt;/em&gt;and not &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;-- I will make certain that you are tossed deep into Ditchbend Prison.&nbsp; You will not see the light of day again until you are far grayer than you already are.&nbsp; Queen's Haven will prosper in spite of you, not because of you.&nbsp; Let that be my triumph, and my recommendation to the Lord Regent.""&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;""Now go,"" Brynn declares, uncoiling a finger to point at the distant door.&nbsp; ""Place your affairs in order.&nbsp; Reconcile yourself to the dishonor that is coming for you.&nbsp; Your banners are down, Grenville.&nbsp; They are down utterly.""&lt;/p&gt;

          <p>Time was at a standstill, frozen before Liz's eyes, Ayesha
falling scarcely an inch as the diminutive woman watched in horror, hand
outstretched to her. Her mind flooded with adrenaline, and therefore, simple
instinct, fight or flight or maybe something else eradicating her otherwise
logical mind in the raw burst of simple impulse.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Her logical mind wouldn't think to reduce her own size. It
made no sense, but blasted with a shaking, electric need to do something, she
drew upon her inner, mysterious workings and began to collapse inside of
herself, the distance between her outstretched hand and friend growing.
Realizing her mistake, even on an instinctual level, she reversed her change in
size, growing back to her normal size again. Then, still desperate, still
irrational, she began to shrink again.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Liz had been an only child, the sole daughter of Andrew and
Patsy Weiss. It was a misconception that a ""loner"" chose a life of solitude.
Sometimes it just worked out that way. Sometimes circumstances pushed a person
in one direction or another, the life of the party or the quiet observer of
that same celebration. It wasn't a role that bothered her, not one that weighed
on her shoulders, but something inside of her had started to move after her
encounter with the Wind Wizard, shift towards something different than her
default approach to life.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">She hadn't thought about Wind Wizard for years, probably
more than a decade, but finding him broken in the rubble of the shattered
super-prison had changed something within her. She hated the idea that someone
who meant something to her could simply disappear. Ayesha and Liz haven't had
the time to become close, haven't been able to spend time off-the-clock in an
effort to strengthen their bond, but Ayesha was a friend, had the potential to
be a close friend. Liz wouldn't lose that. Not today.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">She expanded her size again, growing to her normal size
again from her brief slip into her smaller, shrunken form, but something
happened, something strange. She stopped at her normal size, paused at her
typical 5'5"" for a moment like there was a groove there, a divot where she
caught herself for a beat, but then she continued to grow, expanding still
more, the distance between her reaching hand and Ayesha finally shrinking as
her size expanded.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Liz's eyes widened, unsure of what was happening, but it
didn't matter. If it helped, if she could catch her friend, whatever was
happening was worth it.</p><p></p><p></p>

To control her own density, to slip through atomic mesh like a ghost or harden herself into a hypersolid battering ram was the merest party trick. It was all connected: density, energy, mass, magnitude. Dang Jia's elixir of life had torn the scales from her eyes, the caul from her brow and shown her the scalar landscape that Einstein had only glimpse from afar.</p><p>Gravity relaxed its hold on Nano Girl and Ayesha. Their fall gentled – slowed – arrested, leaving them cushioned in mid air, the warlike dart of the <em>Victorious Talon</em>'s prow high above, the ocean lapping invitingly below.</p><p>Nano Girl felt her fingers prised apart by an irresistible force, and Ayesha rose slowly from the palm of her hand, levitating like some classical goddess, her toga-sheet coiled around her hips and shoulders, diagonally across her body in some vestige of modesty. The very air around Ayesha was warped, the light lensed to create a distortion that made her skin seem darker, the sheet paler. Globules of utterly black meta-energy, what could only be called a <em><strong>krackle </strong></em>bled from her skin and seethed in an aura around her, as dark as the hearts of distant galaxies.</p><p>Ayesha smiled at her plus-sized friend beatifically. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><strong>“...no matter how big you are, you're still so small to me,”</strong> </span>she said, her voice thrumming with a resonance Nano Girl had never heard before. Lifting her palms skywards the smallest degree, Ayesha began to levitate them towards the flying ship, rising to the heavens like a darkly beautiful and brilliantly terrible angel.</p>

How limited! To control her own density, to slip through atomic mesh like a ghost or harden herself into a hypersolid battering ram was the merest party trick. It was all connected: density, energy, mass, magnitude. Dang Jia's elixir of life had torn the scales from her eyes, the caul from her brow and shown her the scalar landscape that Einstein had only glimpse from afar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gravity relaxed its hold on Nano Girl and Ayesha. Their fall gentled – slowed – arrested, leaving them cushioned in mid air, the warlike dart of the &lt;em&gt;Victorious Talon&lt;/em&gt;'s prow high above, the ocean lapping invitingly below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nano Girl felt her fingers prised apart by an irresistible force, and Ayesha rose slowly from the palm of her hand, levitating like some classical goddess, her toga-sheet coiled around her hips and shoulders, diagonally across her body in some vestige of modesty. The very air around Ayesha was warped, the light lensed to create a distortion that made her skin seem darker, the sheet paler. Globules of utterly black meta-energy, what could only be called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;krackle &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;bled from her skin and seethed in an aura around her, as dark as the hearts of distant galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayesha smiled at her plus-sized friend beatifically. &lt;span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“...no matter how big you are, you're still so small to me,”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;she said, her voice thrumming with a resonance Nano Girl had never heard before. Lifting her palms skywards the smallest degree, Ayesha began to levitate them towards the flying ship, rising to the heavens like a darkly beautiful and brilliantly terrible angel.&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>The Tazatel agent hurries through the street, not wishing to be caught after curfew, for fear an over-inquisitive watchman would have to fall foul of an accident too. Of course, Evagail felt indifferent about the plight of the city and its denizens - but an overly bloody trail of collateral would reflect badly on her work, and Thatcher would not approve.</p><p>Having planned for violence, she had naturally planned for injury, and knew in exquisite detail one or two routes through the arse-ends of Dunsmouth that would get her to the door of preferred physician, Professor Baltimore.</p><p>An interesting old salt, he was neither truly an ally nor an adversary. Instead, he offered agents in distress no-questions-asked surgical assistance - usually with a heady dose of laudanum on either side - in exchange for certain favours. He was not thought to be any kind of threat to the Tazatel, on account of his questionable reputation - were any allegations made, he could be made to look like a devil much sooner than the useless authorities could bring down a boot on the Nendmen.</p><p>Breathless, with her slashed face stinging in the clinging evening air, she reached the door in the narrow, cramped street where Baltimore held his surgery. A bronze plaque marked the building. Naturally, it was after surgery hours - but she knew better. She picked up the heavy door knocker, the shape of a wolf's maw, and dropped it heavily against the wooden door three times.</p>

          <p>The walk from the tidy, stylishly appointed streets of Hearthside to the strictly ordered passages of grimy Cinderfall had taken a lot out of Evagail and she's tottering just a bit as she reaches Baltimore's door. This neighborhood is so named because of its position on the leeward side of the foundries and manufactories of the industrial sector and there is a perpetually sooty weariness about the place that keeps eyes downcast and footsteps on the shortest path to one's destination. The tightly-stacked architecture primarily houses laborers and servicemen, still setting Cinderfall several notches above downtrodden Queen's Haven in terms of quality of life but there is a cloying closeness to the atmosphere here that Evagail finds distracting. Even the liberating perspective from Alfie's rooftop eyries up above the dirty brick tenements does nothing to mitigate her unease when visiting this district.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(99, 36, 35);"">Multiple stab wounds provide little by way of additional comfort, as it happens,</span></em></strong> she reflects ruefully, with gritted teeth.</p><p>As she drops the heavy knocker to clunk with dull and ominous reverberations against the sturdy oak of Baltimore's door, she identifies her oversight. The crafty surgeon prefers his after-hours patients to employ the rear entrance, she remembers, limiting any troublesome conclusions to which his neighbors might arrive. It's too late now to amend her plan of ingress, of course, and a quick study of her surroundings reveals no suspicious onlookers. Still, Evagail is embarrassed at how easily her injuries have shaken her professionalism.</p><p>At least she'd been sharp enough to elude any unwanted encounters after leaving the greenhouse.&nbsp;</p><p>Glancing down at herself under the guttering light of the nearby streetlamp as she awaits Baltimore's response to her summons, Evagail gravely tries to ignore the pain and gauge the damage she'd taken. The left sleeve of her coat hangs in tatters below the elbow though she'd done her best to restrict the flow of blood from that limb, if only to avoid leaving an incriminating trail. The gouge beneath her right breast doesn't feel quite so bad but there's a cool, gummy layer sticking a wide section of her dress to her skin there that&nbsp;reminds her all too clearly of Teague's blade scraping against her ribs. Worst of all is the rip in her cheek, letting out a sluggish but so far unrelenting seepage of vital fluid to trickle down her neck and soak the shoulder of her garments. All those brutal new additions to her appearance come with an assortment of less serious nicks and bruises from her protracted scuffle. Speckled with potting soil, bits of ornamental foliage, and splinters from Teague's wooden shelving, Evagail imagines she ought to tell quite a story upon first impression but is too beaten at the moment to care.</p><p><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(99, 36, 35);"">No really valuable real estate hit,</span></em></strong> she tells herself for the fifteenth time, in regard to her major organs, honestly more hopeful than clinical. <strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(99, 36, 35);"">And if he'd clipped an artery, I'd be lost and leaking by now all over Hearthside's fanciest stonework, would I not?</span></em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Like so many members of the Tazatel before her, there's a part of her that turns to the organization's quasi-religious connections when pushed beyond her limits.

What have I truly won today? Will it matter?</span></em></strong></p><p>Furrowing her brow in consternation at that—and grimacing as invisible strings of torment threaded through her wounded cheek twist cruelly with the expression—Evagail steers away from this troubling and unproductive consideration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(99, 36, 35);"">Am I strong enough to see this through?</span></em></strong> She nods vehemently in reply to that one as it's an answer she believes she already knows. <strong><em><span style=""color: rgb(99, 36, 35);"">Yes.

			<p>
	Pilots sat in the briefing room and awaited the start
of the proceedings. Pilots of the 
	<em>Checker
Squadron
	</em> sat side by with pilots and gunners from the <em>Foxfire Squadron</em>. Their droids beeped behind them in cacophony of
beeps and cheeps. Jessa felt that someone was looking on her and when she
lifted her head, she saw that Kytra Quo and her gunner Ryate were also amongst
the ones sitting there.</p><p>
	<img src=""https://image.ibb.co/eduzh7/rebel_base_750.jpg"">&nbsp;</p><p>
	In front of them stood Commodore Ratal and Commander
Syrush engaged in a quiet talk, while Kerrick from the Alliance Intelligence
sat somewhat behind and seemed lost in his thoughts. Jessa shivered when she
saw him in the room, but he doesn’t seem to be aware that she was present.&nbsp;

forward:

	Kai was sitting silently on the
briefing as he was scratching the barcode with his prisoner number, tattooed on
the back of his hand. He looked around. It was only few weeks back, when he sat
in the same room with Commander Carr, Skeeter as her number two, Epp, Theebo
and Amara. That was the 
	<em>Checker Squadron</em>
	back then… but three died since and Theebo couldn’t handle it anymore and left…
as he had no fight in him left. Kai wasn’t surprised that baron Syrush allowed
him to be reassigned to non-combat duties… Alliance doesn’t force people to
serve in the frontlines if they don’t want to. In the battle, you want people on
your left and right to be counted upon. &nbsp;</p><p>
	Only Amara, who was now a Squadron
Leader, was a familiar face. Others were newcomers. Ky’ron, the only survivor
of the last batch of pilot reinforcements … Michaiah, who flew transport shuttles
before … Jessa, the Mandalorian saved from that asteroid field, obviously
having a lot of issues … Juru, reassigned to combat role from duties of analyst
and tactitian. He sighed. He was the number two now. It was his job to keep an
eye on them, while Amara could lead the Squadron. Good number two always solves
problems in the Squadron, so the Squadron Leader doesn’t have to. He made a
mental note to visit everyone before the flight and ask them how they were
doing and if they were ok to fly. He learned that from Skeeter, who was now dead
and gone… 
	<em>damn that tatoo, it was itching
the whole day long.

to her and added quietly:

not necessary. Keep it if you want to… but I have no intention to harm you... nor

Captain Verenz and the so-called Task Force Scorch. We don’t know much more
than that… but it is supposed to be some kind of detached formation tasked with
hunting Rebel shipping and given a lot of leniency in doing so. Word is they may
be reassigned to the Ninth Fleet operating in our area, but no one really
knows. Still... I didn’t forget and I won’t. We are gathering more info as we speak

it is a good thing that you don’t want an answer from an Intelligence officer,
because he woudn’t give you one. What you desire to know is a strictly confidential
infromation. But… I do have a debt to you… so as a &lt;em&gt;normal human being&lt;/em&gt;... the name you are looking for is
Captain Verenz and the so-called Task Force Scorch. We don’t know much more
than that… but it is supposed to be some kind of detached formation tasked with
hunting Rebel shipping and given a lot of leniency in doing so. Word is they may
be reassigned to the Ninth Fleet operating in our area, but no one really
knows. Still... I didn’t forget and I won’t. We are gathering more info as we speak
and we &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;get even.”
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	As Jessa sat in her cockpit and mechanics
worked around her, she had time to look around. Her eyes wuickly found an Y-wing
crewed by Kytra Quo and her gunner Ryate. He was busy checking their fighter-bomber,
while Togruta pilot, as always barefoot, knelt uder the nose of her plane. She
was calm and acted without a haste, as like she had all the time in the world. Others
in hangar were used to her pre-flight ritual, and only a handful newcomers were
watching her curiously, but Jessa watched it with fascination.</p><p>
	She was sitting on her heels, her
head bowed, whispering something that Jessa didn’t hear. She raised an Akul-tooth
in her hand and touched her forehead with it, before laying it on the ground
and reaching for small box on her side. Inside was mix of local red clay and sand.
She took it out and started to spread it over her face and arms with a whisper,
asking the spirits of the land to protect her on her next mission. Clay from
her fingers draw strange symbols on her skin and when she was finished, she
stood up and drew few more on her Y-wing, before closing the small box. She
kneeled again, touched her forehead with Akul-tooth before putting it back in her
pocket. Kytra smiled, as covered wth mud and sand, she was ready to fly to the
stars.</p>

          <p>Jessa nodded at the ground crew
as they started calibrating her cockpit. “<strong>Can
you switch the display text from basic to Mandoa?”</strong> she asked one of the
techs near her. <strong>“I can read and speak
basic but when fighting every millisecond counts. Also, according to my HUD,
the air filter of this T-65 hasn’t been changed in over a year.”</strong> She remarked.
Like this, work progressed moderately fast and the occasional interjection of
Rowdy lightened the mood. When Jessa saw the Togruta however, her heart dropped
somewhere between her kidneys. <strong>“You had
to have the Y-Wing right next to me didn’t you beautiful…”</strong> she muttered,
which was followed by Rowdy’s remark <strong><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; color: #C00000;"">“Observation: Your heartrate has become erratic after seeing
that female there master. Would you like me to call medical support?”</span></strong> Jessa
just hissed <strong>“Oh be quiet you bucket of
bolts or I use you for target practice…”</strong> She was yet again happy to be
wearing her helmet as she was blushing heavily. While Rowdy might have wanted to
voice his offence, he knew better than to push Jessa in moments like this,
which is why he remained silent.</p>

<p>Going through the pre-flight
checklist was tedious but necessary, especially since the girl had not have
time&nbsp;to train on the fighter before her first mission. <i style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">“Not optimal but I will just have to learn quickly” </i><span style=""color: rgb(127, 127, 127);"">Jessa thought.
When she was nearly done with the list, she noticed something and immediately
called the chief of her ground crew. </span><b style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"">“Chief
I might be wrong, but shouldn’t there be 6 torpedoes in the tubes? The system
only registers 5. Please make sure if that is a sensor glitch and fix that or
if there in fact are only 5 then give me another one.”</b></p><b style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""></b>

<p>The mechanic quickly hurried

she asked while getting up. With her pre-flight checklist done, the Mandalorian
left Rowdy in charge of final adjustments. She walked over to the Y-wing, next
to which Kytra was standing. She looked at the craft that clearly was in desperate

          <form class=""edit-message-form"">
            <textarea class=""message-content-editor"">&lt;p&gt;Jessa nodded at the ground crew
as they started calibrating her cockpit. “&lt;strong&gt;Can
you switch the display text from basic to Mandoa?”&lt;/strong&gt; she asked one of the
techs near her. &lt;strong&gt;“I can read and speak
basic but when fighting every millisecond counts. Also, according to my HUD,
the air filter of this T-65 hasn’t been changed in over a year.”&lt;/strong&gt; She remarked.
Like this, work progressed moderately fast and the occasional interjection of
Rowdy lightened the mood. When Jessa saw the Togruta however, her heart dropped
somewhere between her kidneys. &lt;strong&gt;“You had
to have the Y-Wing right next to me didn’t you beautiful…”&lt;/strong&gt; she muttered,
which was followed by Rowdy’s remark &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ""Verdana"",sans-serif; color: #C00000;'&gt;“Observation: Your heartrate has become erratic after seeing
that female there master. Would you like me to call medical support?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Jessa
just hissed &lt;strong&gt;“Oh be quiet you bucket of
bolts or I use you for target practice…”&lt;/strong&gt; She was yet again happy to be
wearing her helmet as she was blushing heavily. While Rowdy might have wanted to
voice his offence, he knew better than to push Jessa in moments like this,
which is why he remained silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the pre-flight
checklist was tedious but necessary, especially since the girl had not have
time&nbsp;to train on the fighter before her first mission. &lt;i style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""&gt;“Not optimal but I will just have to learn quickly” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=""color: rgb(127, 127, 127);""&gt;Jessa thought.
When she was nearly done with the list, she noticed something and immediately
called the chief of her ground crew. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""&gt;“Chief
I might be wrong, but shouldn’t there be 6 torpedoes in the tubes? The system
only registers 5. Please make sure if that is a sensor glitch and fix that or
if there in fact are only 5 then give me another one.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;""&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

elbows and had mud and grains of sand on her face and arms. She smiled on the
newcomer: 
	<strong>“It is nice to see you again,
daughter of the fierce Mandalore.”
	</strong> As she was holding her small box made of
some unknown reddish wood, she shrugged: 
	<strong>“I
am glad to share, but it is just not that interesting… I am Togruta and I walk
the old path, guided by the spirits and the land itself. That clay on my skin
is called 
	<em>iqri’uo</em>. We prepare it from
a mixture of local clay and oils. According to the tradition, it is made from
the earth of planet we are walking on… so this one has more sand in it. Back home
we spread the clay on our bodies when we hunt, because the ravenous Akul have difficulties
to cath our scent when we are covered in it… and now we use it to protect us
prom the dangers of the deep dark space above. This way, the spirits can find
me even up there in the cold and guide me back on the solid ground.”
	</strong> She
let Jessa touch the clay and smiled again: 
	<strong>“Back
on Shili, there is not much water and we had to walk long distances to gather
it… so we also use 
	<em>iqri’uo</em> to clean
our skin from dirt. It served me well here, where the water is also scarce.”

	<strong>“Those who departed are never really lost to us as there is someone to
remember them.”
	</strong> Togruta smiled on her, but when
Jessa squeezed Kytra’s hand, she paused for a second and her smile faded an
inch. She gave the Mandalorian girl an inquiring and little confused look as if
questioning… if what she 
	<em>thought</em> was
happening was 
	<em>really</em> happening. Her
eyes were deep and impenetrable. Whatever she thought about it, stayed hidden
behind them. She smiled again just a little bit: 
	<strong>“I admit… I was a little worried, when you rushed away like that… I
hope I didn’t offend you in any way. If I did somehow, please do accept my
deepest apologies. It was not my intention.”
	</strong> With her hands crossed on her
heart, she bowed deeply to her for a few heartbeats, before straightening up: 
	<strong>“We can talk about the Togruta cultural
heritage after the mission if you would prefer that. There is no rush.”
	</strong></p><p>
	As Jessa talked to Y-wing
gunner, his head popped up again on the top of the plane, this time with his
hand holding monkey wrench: 
	<strong>“Only the dead
can enter the great beyond, so to kick my ass, you need to be dead too. If you
would die just to kick my ass, I would laugh it off before you even manage to
land one kick! Ha!” 
	</strong>He disappeared again.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>

smile that was, truth to be told, a little more than intimidating and Mandalorian
girl inadvertently remembered that one of those rumours also stated that
Togrutas were venomous. As she heard

either way to indicate what she thought about it.&nbsp;</p><p>
	Few bystanders burst out
laughing as Jessa was speaking to Ryate, because he joker was caricaturing the
Mandalorian marching on the top of Y-wing with a bucket on his head and
gesturing importantly. Before she could do something unwarranted, Togruta pilot
gently touched her arm: 
	<strong>“All is
forgiven, as those who stare death in the face shouldn’t bother with small
transgressions people sometimes feel are important. Here and now, they are not.

so, if you excuse me…”

Brining the precious water for the gardens. Maenna had not yet officially gone through the rites and rituals for full membership when Damson tracked her down. But, it was not any surprise that Damson found her at the White Garden, where they tended the special flowers. The New Path started about a week after the bombings. A large faction of the faithful left the main religion and no longer considered themselves orthodox Woven. They called themselves the New Path, or the New Weave. They drank the flowers, had visions and revelations, and if not joy, at least a removal of pain. </p><p>Some gangs of militant, traditional Woven, had started assaulting and harassing them, but it had not spiraled into full out sectarian violence, yet. Some of the New Path, around the time Damson came calling for Maenna, though--were starting to sing a new song, less tolerant, more dogmatic. Damson heard rumors of one assassination, a Woven priest shot in the back. </p><p>Nasak was one of the first to start the more militant ideas in the New Path sect. Nasak, before all this, before the bombs, before he ever drank of the flower, was Ro’s lover. </p><p><strong>Bert, if you’re listening in here, tell us, what was that all about? Why is Nasak still bitter or obsessed or otherwise interested in Ro? </strong></p><p>As Damson entered the White Garden she found Maenna speaking quietly to Alieh. It was obvious to Damson that Maenna had just drank a tincture of the flowers and was in trance. Alieh guided Maenna to a set of pillows near an empty pool, and, upon seeing Damson, walked up to her. </p>

It didn't show at first, but it got worse and worse.""&lt;/strong&gt; They pause as if remembering what that was like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""Nasak got so jealous that he couldn't stand Ro being with other people, you know, talking to them, sitting next to them, sharing food with them. Ro was trying to assure and appease him at first. Eventually they told him to cool it, but that only made Nasak more jealous, more demanding. So, Ro wouldn't have any of that shit, they told him when he started on that issue a couple of times. Then Nasak tried to force them, wanted to beat them into shape.""&lt;/strong&gt; Bert laughs and shares a conspiratory look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""You can imagine how that went.""&lt;/strong&gt; They laugh again while you alternatingly glance between them and Ro whose rifle's barrel, slung over their shoulder, just catches some rays of the setting sun as they load some tinkling crates into the cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;""Long story short, they broke up with Nasak running with his tail between his legs. He still thinks, though, that he owns them, no matter how many times Ro makes a point that they're their own person and he should stay the fuck away.""&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>The newly opened bar had quite a lot of people in it. Doli quickly located the lonesome man sitting by himself having a drink. It was rather easy to approach him, get him to buy her a drink. Quickly words started falling out of him - telling Doli of his business, and how it's all falling apart because of some gang.&nbsp;</p><p>Touching him was easy - he yearned for touch - so soon she was no longer hungry. And yet, the man now was both in a very bad position and even weaker to fend off against the gangsters.&nbsp;</p>

""It's always so interesting to see how close.. or far they get... The drink is usualy made in New Orleans and it's fairly complex. Anyways, back to the matter at hand. Who? Where? And most importantly... Why?""&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<p><img src=""https://d2folr83karyot.cloudfront.net/image/16912.jpg""></p><p>Sunny and Kyffin, (and anyone else joining them) make their way out of the town and along the road east. The sun is shining and the sky is a bright blue with only a dusting of clouds to the south. The only sounds in the fields next to the road are the songs of birds and the chirping of insects. The breeze carries the scents of rich soil and grain.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Farmer Hansen's steading is south-east of town, comprising some 150 acres. He farms mostly maize, amaranth, and quinoa. The path from the road to his farmhouse runs north to south, and as you walk into his circle of land you see him at the first intersection. He's a stocky man of 50+ years, with skin a dark, leathery tan, deep brown eyes and a sharp nose. He is standing on the road, looking in toward the field, and doesn't see you approaching.</p><p><img src=""https://d2folr83karyot.cloudfront.net/image/16915.jpg""></p>

The large center room is sparsely decorated and furnished; old cork boards with empty shells pushed into them poorly spelling TOILIT, OCKTOBURS ROOM and ARMORY while pointing different directions make up the majority of what could be called wall art, with several desks, a table and a workbench being the most notable furniture in the main room, alongside a very badly bowing couch. And on every available flat surface is evidence of Dylan's profession: gun parts, cleaning oil, empty magazines and cartridges, pieces of scrap metal, old treated timber. And most recently there are a number of children's toys lying in one corner, sun bleached and with most of them missing pieces, inevitably lost to time.</p><p>Still, all things considered, it's surprisingly clean, with the only notable mess due to the dust and debris from Dylan's most recent 'expansion,' the fortification of the new area clearly taking precedence. All in all, a comparatively spacious and simple housing fit for a mercenary.&nbsp;<br>Something interesting though...it takes a moment for the realization to gestate, but eventually it becomes clear that as much as this place fits Dylan (or, at least the description of him), it doesn't fit October. It doesn't <em>feel</em>&nbsp;like a teenage girl lives here or that a musician would call this home. In fact, aside from the poorly spelled sign pointing to her room, you'd be forgiven for thinking she doesn't live here at all...</p><p><strong><span style=""color: rgb(95, 73, 122);"">""Dylan! Hope?

The large center room is sparsely decorated and furnished; old cork boards with empty shells pushed into them poorly spelling TOILIT, OCKTOBURS ROOM and ARMORY while pointing different directions make up the majority of what could be called wall art, with several desks, a table and a workbench being the most notable furniture in the main room, alongside a very badly bowing couch. And on every available flat surface is evidence of Dylan's profession: gun parts, cleaning oil, empty magazines and cartridges, pieces of scrap metal, old treated timber. And most recently there are a number of children's toys lying in one corner, sun bleached and with most of them missing pieces, inevitably lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, all things considered, it's surprisingly clean, with the only notable mess due to the dust and debris from Dylan's most recent 'expansion,' the fortification of the new area clearly taking precedence. All in all, a comparatively spacious and simple housing fit for a mercenary.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Something interesting though...it takes a moment for the realization to gestate, but eventually it becomes clear that as much as this place fits Dylan (or, at least the description of him), it doesn't fit October. It doesn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;like a teenage girl lives here or that a musician would call this home. In fact, aside from the poorly spelled sign pointing to her room, you'd be forgiven for thinking she doesn't live here at all...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=""color: rgb(95, 73, 122);""&gt;""Dylan! Hope? Stokes? Anybody home?""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; October calls out hopefully, nervously.&lt;/p&gt;

The rabbit, well he’s just an asshole.

Maybe work in a part of the Manifesto. My head hurts. &lt;strong&gt;""I...thought we might need support. For tonight."" &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look up at her, hoping the lie sticks. Hoping I sent that text to Kate &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;Mary told me about Mister Atom. I did...right?&lt;/p&gt;

			<p>As my training continued it eventually gnawed at me that I I had not seen the ""Roach"" in quite some time, For all the grief he gives me I do owe him. And I squelch on my debts. </p><p>I was not exactly sure how to get to him, but fortunately he was&nbsp; waiting for me outside of the tournament area. Apparently a friend of a friend tipped him off I was at the tournament, my relief turned a little sour when I realized this tip probably had a steep cost, this place was way beyond his dealings.</p><p>""So this is how you lay low""- he said with a chuckle. I explained that my entree was not entirely of my own volition. He insitited he knew all about that. Whether it was true or he just wanted to sound in the know I couldn't tell.&nbsp;</p><p>""Look I got a big job for you"" - he whispered the mirth leaving his face. "" I have a jar and the damn lid will not come off"". I sank a little bit, this was code making someone talk, he knew I did not like that kind of work.</p><p>""Look I would not ask you if this was a normal jar, but this damn Lid will not budge, and I dont want to say it but I stuck my neck-"" I interrupted him ""I owe you"". We both gave eachother a little nod.</p><p>it took us about 2 days to get to the ""guest Quarters"" Inside was a strikingly muscular grey man stark naked thoroughly chained to chair. Obviously he was not human, or fully. His bright green eyes clashed with ash grey skin. He looked to my entrance with amusement in his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Although I disdained torture, I have been called in the past to help, usually as a big scary prop. But this one was not going to give in that easily.&nbsp;</p><p>He had been held hear for at least a week, probably held in another location longer, and seemed completely unphased.</p><p>First impression's I thought to myself, in a commanding voice I said ""You are going to talk, how much of you is intact is entirely up to you"".&nbsp;</p><p>Not a word just amusement on his face like a child about to receive a toy. </p><p>I rolled up my sleeve slowly letting the tension build leaned back so he could see my full height and punched him square in the jaw as hard as I could. It felt like hitting a wall,&nbsp; no give, no impression that I was ever going to move it, saying his skin was like stone did not accurately portray it, his face was a mountain. I tried to hide my shock and the pain in my fist the best I could, but the smile practically screamed he knew. I looked at the men guarding him, broken fists, damaged weapons. </p><p>""no ones accusing you of having a glass jaw""- I complimented him. I pulled out my sword it, and layed it on his should letting him have a good look. I explained to him I am not even sure how old it is or who made it. But we all know how dangerous an artifact can be,</p><p>His eyes moved from the blade back to me, and again a big grin stretched across his face. I slid the blade across his skin attemping to dig in but again to no avail, I pushed harder and harder until I realized if this was a normal blade it would have shattered.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I then swung down hard on his hair, nothing, not even a cut strand. and that same god damn smile across his face.</p><p>Changing gears I picked up piece of metal from one of the boys swords, I asked him to start a fire outside and bring me this when he was ready.&nbsp; With that my gaze turned backed to the grey man who sat their, smile never fading.</p><p>After two days of trying everything of shocking him, burning him, crushing, slashing, nothing phased him, even jabbed molten steel in his eye. Nothing.</p><p>I reported to the ""Roach"" Nothing is breaking him. But I met some new people that might be able to help. and thus I returned back to the tournament area seeking assistance from my team members.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; </p><br>

          <p><del>&nbsp;</del>Damn it, damn it, damn it. I cant wait to get out from underneath that cursed exalteds thumb. Here I am in my paradise. Alone, no one to interrupt my studies or experiments, and no one raising pitchforks because of my less than adequate looks, <del>but marvelous hair</del>. Anyways I have to leave this paradise or that witch Rose will mark me for death more then I already am, which is to simply put, a lot. Nevertheless I will abandon my studies for now as... I am -obligated- as she puts it to serve, not that she appreciates my genius, and until I wiggle my way out of that oppression I will do as bid. However, the tasks she has me doing&nbsp; this time around are all trivial which I could knock out in a day or two. I suppose I could go gambling for a bit... wouldn't hurt any right?</p><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I walk around the tournament stands prowling for a game of chance to win. Despite gods and mythical creatures being the ones to reside in this place I'm still rejected at every turn and to be honest it stings a little. Without some big chip to bet no one is willing to stand the sight of me. <del><strong>Perhaps if I put on make up they would see how fabulous I could be.</strong></del>&nbsp;</div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">At the boiling point of my frustrations for being rejected my simpleton of a team mate Sid comes begging and pleading for my help. Apparently there is a man hes trying to break, but just does not possess the inventiveness to do so. I suppose I could help, Sid would owe me a favor and this is an excellent way to take out my frustrations in a ""healthy"" manner. .&nbsp;</div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">After agreeing to assist Sid with his endeavor to break a man. He more then eager to bring me to a nearby town near the base mountain. When we get in town we cross through some back alleys before he eventually bring me to a lone looking door. At this point my attention wavers a bit. He goes through what could only be described a stereotypical villainous code as he does a rhythm and says nonsensical words strung together. In all honesty I stop caring at this point and start to space out.</div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Eventually Sid gets us inside the building where he greeted by.... lesser thugs. They all seem to stare at me with actual awe. Perhaps they think I'm some sort of mad man who is well versed in the art of torture. I couldn't blame them. My looks tend to make people think like that. Eventually these lesser thugs guide us to the basement before bringing us to a dry bleak dreary gray room. Inside it are two guards stationed, sid, and in the center of the room a&nbsp;<del>chiseled, sexy,</del> naked Gray Man. I walk up to the man calmly giving him my best mad doctor smile, <del>but it comes out as a sensual smile.</del>&nbsp;The Gray Man shudders at the sight of my look. Clearly this wont be that hard.</div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I tell the man sitting before me,</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&nbsp;""You're going to spill everything these fine people want to know... or I will put you through the same hell that made me look like this.""&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I give him that same mad smile I gave him before. However this time his reaction is different, he seems to give me a mocking smile like I put him back in his element.</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">""Oh Well, don't say I didn't&nbsp;offer you the easy way out.""</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">And just like that I began getting to work to break this man. I start off with some light.... -experiments- to see just how resilient this man is. A few prods and pokes with a sharp weapon some flayed skin here and there. However the man just keeps that mocking smile through it all. Perhaps I need to put some effort into it.</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I pull my bag out. I show the man all manners of concoctions. Poisons, laxatives, mind warping drugs. I dont take the time to bother explaining them. I can guess he already figured out all these potions and vials I laid before him does not bode well for his health.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I start applying several home brews just to experiment. An ointment that would make a man feel like they are burning wherever applied. Results are ineffective he doesnt even seem to break a sweat. I break a green vial infront of his nose. One whiff of this stuff and nightmares start to become a reality in the eyes of the beholder. However, this man still doesnt seem to break as if he mentally pushed himself through whatever nightmares hes seeing. Okay... time to bring out the big guns. I grab a vial filled with powder. This powder however is the devils powder. You put this on someone and they are liable to flay their own skin just to make the pain stop. I slowly apply this to each limb of the man. Slowly stopping to see if he ever broke that mocking smile. I frown, he didn't.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Through the hours I try all manner of combinations but I cant seem to get it into this Gray Man's thick skull that he should fear me. It aggravating. <del>Why dont you let me try?</del>&nbsp;Ah Hah! I have an idea. I feel myself moving and thoughts flow into my head... strange part is I cant seem to recognize my own thoughts. How odd of a feeling. I walk up to the man I feel my body making its own actions. I just watch for now. My body seems to be... giggling? Am I giggling? The Gray Man seems to be put back on the defensive losing that mocking smile. I playfully slide me finger up and down the mans body as if I'm... caressing him? I try to stop myself, but my hands wont listen to me. For a few more minutes I seem to play with the man but then I suddenly stop only to start... playing with his hair? Am I knotting his hair? Words leave my mouth, but they arn't mine.</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">""Eyes you can get lost in, an exotic skin tone, abs to die for, but your hair is something were going to have to work on honey.""</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">
<strong>I. Did. Not. Say. That. </strong>I feel like I'm shouting at myself to stop but I cant. I try to walk away from the Gray Man but my body just keeps playing with his hair. I come to the realization that I'm not in control. Something is controlling me, but what? It cant be magic.. I'm not so weak willed... am I? The only bright side to any of this is the Gray Man just looks down right disturbed having long since lost that mocking smile for a more pleasant look of dread. Even if I feel like I have that same look of dread.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br></div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">My body stops knotting the mans hair after a while. It seems to look around my bag, I know my body is looking for a mirror, but I stopped carrying those ever since my disfigurement for obvious reason. My body seems frustrated.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">""Thats a shame, I thought I had a mirror to show you what I've done with your hair. It looks positively lovely! ""&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The guards in the room seem to be giving my strange looks as well as Sid, but they let me continue.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">""Not a big talker are you? Thats a shame, but I suppose a man of mystery has is own unique appeal I could get behind.""</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I walk infront of the man and lean forwards looking the man dead in the eyes. I see the same horrified look in his eyes as I know are in mine. My body is going in for a kiss. I actively am bucking, screaming, shouting for my body to stop but it just doesn't listen. The Gray Man in a moment of desperation rocks his head back at the last possible second before head butting me in the nose. Just like that I'm back in control my hands move the way I want them to and this pain is mine. I feel in the back of my thoughts something screaming in pain. Thats odd.. I dont feel pain, not anymore at least but yet I know some part of me does. I go to feel my nose and I realize is broken.&nbsp;</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><del><strong>That bastard broke my nose! I was only showing him affection.</strong></del></div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">""You bastard, you broke my nose.""<br>
</div><div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">I swear I hear a voice, that it both mine and not. Am I losing it? Well I couldnt say. I feel an anger boil up from inside me. I dont know why but I was both wildly pleased the man stopped me and insanely pissed off he rejected my affections. I need to get out of this place to clear my head. Just as I pack up to leave I see the man giving me a bigger mocking smile then I have ever seen him give since I came into this place.

Here I am in my paradise. Alone, no one to interrupt my studies or experiments, and no one raising pitchforks because of my less than adequate looks, &lt;del&gt;but marvelous hair&lt;/del&gt;. Anyways I have to leave this paradise or that witch Rose will mark me for death more then I already am, which is to simply put, a lot. Nevertheless I will abandon my studies for now as... I am -obligated- as she puts it to serve, not that she appreciates my genius, and until I wiggle my way out of that oppression I will do as bid. However, the tasks she has me doing&nbsp; this time around are all trivial which I could knock out in a day or two. I suppose I could go gambling for a bit... wouldn't hurt any right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I walk around the tournament stands prowling for a game of chance to win. Despite gods and mythical creatures being the ones to reside in this place I'm still rejected at every turn and to be honest it stings a little. Without some big chip to bet no one is willing to stand the sight of me. &lt;del&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perhaps if I put on make up they would see how fabulous I could be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;At the boiling point of my frustrations for being rejected my simpleton of a team mate Sid comes begging and pleading for my help. Apparently there is a man hes trying to break, but just does not possess the inventiveness to do so. I suppose I could help, Sid would owe me a favor and this is an excellent way to take out my frustrations in a ""healthy"" manner. .&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;After agreeing to assist Sid with his endeavor to break a man. He more then eager to bring me to a nearby town near the base mountain. When we get in town we cross through some back alleys before he eventually bring me to a lone looking door. At this point my attention wavers a bit. He goes through what could only be described a stereotypical villainous code as he does a rhythm and says nonsensical words strung together. In all honesty I stop caring at this point and start to space out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;Eventually Sid gets us inside the building where he greeted by.... lesser thugs. They all seem to stare at me with actual awe. Perhaps they think I'm some sort of mad man who is well versed in the art of torture. I couldn't blame them. My looks tend to make people think like that. Eventually these lesser thugs guide us to the basement before bringing us to a dry bleak dreary gray room. Inside it are two guards stationed, sid, and in the center of the room a&nbsp;&lt;del&gt;chiseled, sexy,&lt;/del&gt; naked Gray Man. I walk up to the man calmly giving him my best mad doctor smile, &lt;del&gt;but it comes out as a sensual smile.&lt;/del&gt;&nbsp;The Gray Man shudders at the sight of my look. Clearly this wont be that hard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I tell the man sitting before me,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&nbsp;""You're going to spill everything these fine people want to know... or I will put you through the same hell that made me look like this.""&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I give him that same mad smile I gave him before. However this time his reaction is different, he seems to give me a mocking smile like I put him back in his element.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;""Oh Well, don't say I didn't&nbsp;offer you the easy way out.""&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;And just like that I began getting to work to break this man. I start off with some light.... -experiments- to see just how resilient this man is. A few prods and pokes with a sharp weapon some flayed skin here and there. However the man just keeps that mocking smile through it all. Perhaps I need to put some effort into it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I pull my bag out. I show the man all manners of concoctions. Poisons, laxatives, mind warping drugs. I dont take the time to bother explaining them. I can guess he already figured out all these potions and vials I laid before him does not bode well for his health.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I start applying several home brews just to experiment. An ointment that would make a man feel like they are burning wherever applied. Results are ineffective he doesnt even seem to break a sweat. I break a green vial infront of his nose. One whiff of this stuff and nightmares start to become a reality in the eyes of the beholder. However, this man still doesnt seem to break as if he mentally pushed himself through whatever nightmares hes seeing. Okay... time to bring out the big guns. I grab a vial filled with powder. This powder however is the devils powder. You put this on someone and they are liable to flay their own skin just to make the pain stop. I slowly apply this to each limb of the man. Slowly stopping to see if he ever broke that mocking smile. I frown, he didn't.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;Through the hours I try all manner of combinations but I cant seem to get it into this Gray Man's thick skull that he should fear me. It aggravating. &lt;del&gt;Why dont you let me try?&lt;/del&gt;&nbsp;Ah Hah! I have an idea. I feel myself moving and thoughts flow into my head... strange part is I cant seem to recognize my own thoughts. How odd of a feeling. I walk up to the man I feel my body making its own actions. I just watch for now. My body seems to be... giggling? Am I giggling? The Gray Man seems to be put back on the defensive losing that mocking smile. I playfully slide me finger up and down the mans body as if I'm... caressing him? I try to stop myself, but my hands wont listen to me. For a few more minutes I seem to play with the man but then I suddenly stop only to start... playing with his hair? Am I knotting his hair? Words leave my mouth, but they arn't mine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;""Eyes you can get lost in, an exotic skin tone, abs to die for, but your hair is something were going to have to work on honey.""&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I. Did. Not. Say. That. &lt;/strong&gt;I feel like I'm shouting at myself to stop but I cant. I try to walk away from the Gray Man but my body just keeps playing with his hair. I come to the realization that I'm not in control. Something is controlling me, but what? It cant be magic.. I'm not so weak willed... am I? The only bright side to any of this is the Gray Man just looks down right disturbed having long since lost that mocking smile for a more pleasant look of dread. Even if I feel like I have that same look of dread.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;My body stops knotting the mans hair after a while. It seems to look around my bag, I know my body is looking for a mirror, but I stopped carrying those ever since my disfigurement for obvious reason. My body seems frustrated.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;""Thats a shame, I thought I had a mirror to show you what I've done with your hair. It looks positively lovely!

Thats a shame, but I suppose a man of mystery has is own unique appeal I could get behind.""&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;I walk infront of the man and lean forwards looking the man dead in the eyes. I see the same horrified look in his eyes as I know are in mine. My body is going in for a kiss. I actively am bucking, screaming, shouting for my body to stop but it just doesn't listen. The Gray Man in a moment of desperation rocks his head back at the last possible second before head butting me in the nose. Just like that I'm back in control my hands move the way I want them to and this pain is mine. I feel in the back of my thoughts something screaming in pain. Thats odd.. I dont feel pain, not anymore at least but yet I know some part of me does. I go to feel my nose and I realize is broken.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That bastard broke my nose! I was only showing him affection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""&gt;""You bastard, you broke my nose.""&lt;br&gt;

I dont know why but I was both wildly pleased the man stopped me and insanely pissed off he rejected my affections. I need to get out of this place to clear my head. Just as I pack up to leave I see the man giving me a bigger mocking smile then I have ever seen him give since I came into this place. I also see the guards and the Sid snickering in the back to themselves. This man has destroyed what was left of my pride and dignity.

In the center of the cavern is an altar, its top stained with the blood of many previous sacrificial offerings. Plumes of incense smoke rise from bowls placed upon the altar.

	<span id=""selection-marker-1"" class=""redactor-selection-marker"">The only Arachnid warship seen so far: a flat wedge with two spikes jutting out of the narrow front end and a total of twelve spines that curve forward coming out of the rear top and bottom. It is like all their constructs an entirely organic ship and as such is alive.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
	The skin of this creature is a strong adapting armour, like that of all Arachnid ships. Backing up this armor are shields consisting of interwoven energy fields and layers of gravitational distortion. These shields are capable of absorbing large amounts of energy, be it directed energy or kinetic in nature.
</p>
<p>
	The armament of the Scout consists of a Quantum Gravitic Discharge Cannon which fires bursts of energy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	The ships sublight propulsion consists of a powerful gravity drive system that is used for maneuvering and main thrust. this gives the Scout superb maneuverability and acceleration. This drive can also be used as a tractor beam. Because of their long experience with FTL physics they have a hyperdrive system that allows them to move in and out of hyperspace at will, at whatever position they wish to appear at. This gives them a great advantage in ambushes etc. they can also use the drive to pass in between hyperspace and real space and be virtually invulnerable there.
</p>
<p>
	Since the ship is alive it has an intelligence similar to that of a sentient AI and so can perform difficult maneuvers on its own. On sensor readings the ship will read as built out of organic materials rather than the metal alloys that most starships are built out of. When its ECM is engaged it is almost impossibly hard to detect.

          <p>Dear Ms. Hotaru,</p><p>Thank you for you letter. I wouldn’t consider myself a famous astronomer, just a lucky one. I was an amateur looking through a small telescope for undiscovered comets when I found what turned out to be the Amenoukihashi. Sometimes the greatest discoveries happen by chance.&nbsp;</p><p>In space natural objects like comets, asteroids and even dust clouds are pulled around by gravity. In the ‘Verse, with our five suns, this results in some pretty strange orbits. Imagine five people pulling on you from different directions. But as strange as they are, they are predictable, if you know the location and momentum of the object relative to all the suns and planets. &nbsp;What you don’t ever see is a natural object suddenly change its direction. And that is what the Amenoukihashi did.</p><p>Of course, the Verse has many space ships traveling between the planets, so spotting a large spaceship would not be that unusual. What was unusual is that the Amenoukihashi was outside the elliptic of the Verse, a sort of flat disk where most of the suns and planets orbit; and where you’d find almost all space traffic. I happened to be looking in that direction because I hoped to find one of those unusual objects that does orbit on that disk.&nbsp;</p><p>I watched the small speck travel in one direction for a week or so, then it changed direction. That was when I knew it wasn’t a comet. The rest is history.</p><p>I don’t know if there are any other Arks out there, though it’s true several others never made it to our system. If you continue to study astronomy, maybe you’ll be the one to find one.</p><p>I hope that all made sense. If not, I hope you will look up some of those words and ideas and tell me if they make sense. And I’d be happy to answer any more questions you have.</p><p>I am happy to correspond with you more if you’d like to learn more about astronomy.</p><p>Maybe you can tell me what are your favorite subjects in school, and your hobbies.&nbsp;</p><p>Beglan Shea,</p><p>But my friends call me ‘Beggar'&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Dear Hotaru-san,</p><p>I spent many years on a ship. I actually loved being in the black, my last ship, a durance class, had a large shuttle bay with huge windows and a roof you could turn transparent. That is where I set up my telescope, but some nights I would just lie there and look all around me at the stars. When I think of them moving in harmony, always changing but ever the same, I see the work of God. It makes me feel better when things are chaotic in my life, to know that it is there, constant. And there has been a lot of chaos in it. Someday, maybe when you're older, I have some stories for you. corse, they may'nt get you to like the Black any more.</p><p>Stella misses her mother terribly. We have a game we play, Rosie takes out personal ads on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Bu_Gao_Lan"" target=""_blank"">Bu Gao Lan</a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;with little clues for us to solve to learn where she is, or where she is going. She hides little things, Easter Eggs she calls them, I could never figure out why, in the messages. It is like a game of hide and seek she plays with Stella from all across the 'Verse. She usually uses the 'penny' ads, or sometime 'lost and found' classified, since those are free. We see each other as much as we can, but we do miss her. It helps to know she is doing good work.</p><p>Where do you think you'll be headed?</p><p>Your friend,</p><p> Beggar</p>

          <p>Video Message 2530.246 6:00 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys</p><p>The video starts with three children staring into the screen. They all are of Japanese descent. The one in the middle is a young girl with short hair that barely reaches to her jawline and blue eyes. On one side is another girl obviously younger with much longer hair wrapped in a ponytail that drapes over her left shoulder. On the other side is a boy who looks to be closer to a teenager with hair neatly combed and parted.&nbsp;</p><p>The three of them are speaking in Japanese to each other. For those who know the language, the dialect that the children are speaking is obviously nothing spoken around the verse in hundreds of years.</p><p>IN JAPANESE:</p><p>“Is it working?” Tomiko, the younger girl asks.</p><p>“Shh,” Hotaru responds, pointing to the screen. “He can hear you.”</p><p>The three children all turn as one to stare at the screen.</p><p>IN ENGLISH:</p><p>In unison, they say, “Happy Birthday, Beggar-San. Thank you for saving us.”</p><p>The three children move as if to bow but because the screen is so small it looks like they are just bobbing their heads.

They all are of Japanese descent. The one in the middle is a young girl with short hair that barely reaches to her jawline and blue eyes. On one side is another girl obviously younger with much longer hair wrapped in a ponytail that drapes over her left shoulder. On the other side is a boy who looks to be closer to a teenager with hair neatly combed and parted.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three of them are speaking in Japanese to each other. For those who know the language, the dialect that the children are speaking is obviously nothing spoken around the verse in hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN JAPANESE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is it working?” Tomiko, the younger girl asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shh,” Hotaru responds, pointing to the screen. “He can hear you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three children all turn as one to stare at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN ENGLISH:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In unison, they say, “Happy Birthday, Beggar-San. Thank you for saving us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three children move as if to bow but because the screen is so small it looks like they are just bobbing their heads. Then they sing a little Japanese birthday song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotaru points to the girl. “This is Tomiko,” she points to the boy. “And this is Daichi”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hotaru talks about you all the time,” Daichi says. “We are honored to leave you his message.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Tomiko pipes up, “She found your birthday in the university database.” Tomiko leans forward so her face takes up the entire space.

          <p>Wave 2535.001 00:10:01 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys</p><p>Happy New Year Beggar-San!</p><p>Daichi came home to visit for the break. Our community had a large celebration. Everyone loves Daichi. My Haha made her famous Onigiri. We all drool when she makes it. Next year I will have to decide if I want to apply to schools off-planet or stay here in RA Shinkyo.</p><p>I find so many sad things in the Verse and then I look around here and see that my people are sad too. I think many of the adults are disappointed at what they see. It is not what they expected. But for now, in the new year, they are happy to see their Daichi-Kun.</p><p>Daichi caught me before Midnight and gave me a ticket to come to his graduation later in the year. He said he had one extra after giving to the rest of his family. I told him to give the ticket to Tomiko because she adores him so but he said he wanted me to go. I want to see him graduate, but I am nervous about getting on the ship.</p><p>I am sad to see that Rosalie could not get home to see your for the new year. I hope you get to see her soon.</p><p>Your Friend,</p><p>Hotaru Minami</p><hr><p>Wave 2535.199 11:59:59 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys</p><p>Dear Beggar-san,</p><p>Daichi is graduating in the morning. I fear I could not get on the ship so I gave the ticket to Tomiko. I hope he will forgive me for giving in to my fear.</p><p>By the way, I have been thinking about your comment regarding all those anonymizers and I started writing my own. Wish me luck!</p><p>Your Friend,</p><p>Hotaru</p><hr><p>Wave 2535.301 08:49:02 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys</p><p>Dear Beggar-san,</p><p>I have finally decided! I will apply to be a teacher. After making lists of all the schools and all the professions I could enter, I did what you suggested and went with my gut. If I am a teacher, I don't have to learn only one thing. My Haha is disappointed with my choice. She says I should go to medical school and become a doctor. She mentioned a university on Osiris. I do not want to go to Osiris or to be a doctor.</p><p>Your Friend,</p><p>Hotaru</p><hr><p>Wave 2536.025 09:09:09 Firefly.Little-Earth.That.Was</p><p>Beggar-san!</p><p>Can you guess who this is? No? Don't worry, it is only me, Hotaru.</p><p>I thought I would try out my new program. I spent all night finishing it up.</p><p>Tomiko is not talking to me anymore.

Our community had a large celebration. Everyone loves Daichi. My Haha made her famous Onigiri. We all drool when she makes it. Next year I will have to decide if I want to apply to schools off-planet or stay here in RA Shinkyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find so many sad things in the Verse and then I look around here and see that my people are sad too. I think many of the adults are disappointed at what they see. It is not what they expected. But for now, in the new year, they are happy to see their Daichi-Kun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daichi caught me before Midnight and gave me a ticket to come to his graduation later in the year. He said he had one extra after giving to the rest of his family. I told him to give the ticket to Tomiko because she adores him so but he said he wanted me to go. I want to see him graduate, but I am nervous about getting on the ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sad to see that Rosalie could not get home to see your for the new year. I hope you get to see her soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Friend,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotaru Minami&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave 2535.199 11:59:59 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Beggar-san,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daichi is graduating in the morning. I fear I could not get on the ship so I gave the ticket to Tomiko. I hope he will forgive me for giving in to my fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I have been thinking about your comment regarding all those anonymizers and I started writing my own. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Friend,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotaru&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave 2535.301 08:49:02 Minami.Hotaru-Tethys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Beggar-san,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have finally decided! I will apply to be a teacher. After making lists of all the schools and all the professions I could enter, I did what you suggested and went with my gut. If I am a teacher, I don't have to learn only one thing. My Haha is disappointed with my choice. She says I should go to medical school and become a doctor. She mentioned a university on Osiris. I do not want to go to Osiris or to be a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Friend,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotaru&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave 2536.025 09:09:09 Firefly.Little-Earth.That.Was&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beggar-san!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you guess who this is? No? Don't worry, it is only me, Hotaru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I would try out my new program. I spent all night finishing it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomiko is not talking to me anymore. She yelled at me yesterday and said I do not understand what she is going through. It is hard for me to understand when she never talks to me anymore. Ever since she went to see Daichi graduate, she seems to be avoiding me. I have tried to ask Daichi but he will not say anything either.

		<div class=""rp-story"">
			<p>It doesn't seem like a house, more like a village. Even though it's definitely after midnight at this point (for Tanner drew his last breath at the very stroke of it), the Embers Estate (as Flora loves to call it with a wink and a smile) does not show any signs of stopping...whatever it is all those people are doing.&nbsp;</p><p>The Embers Estate was once referred to as the Abney House, a historical plantation on the very edge of Arlington Brook's city limits. The last owner in a line dating back to the 1600's, Dr. Zachariah Abney, ended up fleeing the town in disgrace back in 1911 after it became known that not only was he running a back-alley abortion clinic for poor, down-on-their-luck girls, but he was also sterilizing them as well, taken up with the eugenics movement at the time, deciding for himself that he did not want such wanton behaviors to be passed on to the next generation. Legend has it that it's haunted, but Aunt Flora knows that there's nothing a bit of white sage can't fix.&nbsp;</p><p>There's beauty in the place, however, with a sweeping lawn and a driveway framed with laurel trees still bright with their autumn colors. Lanterns are strung through the branches of every tree, lighting the way of the cars. Grazing animals, goats and sheep, make a meal of the front lawn.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the house there's a servant's quarters, converted into a clinic where Aunt Flora sees her patients, but everything else is pure chaos. People laugh and dance around a bonfire unceremoniously lit in the backyard. It's clear that a party is going on, with people wearing animal masks paired with strange formal wear: a tuxedo here, a ball gown there, togas, kilts, ceremonial dresses from all sorts of cultures. A slight woman with strawberry blonde hair serves what seems to be wine out of a giant metal garbage can, wearing a white dress and the mask of a deer, antlers and leaves crown her brow. A man in a pig mask tries to jump the bonfire, while another man in a fox mask holds him back.</p><p>There is a weird indication that this isn't even a party. This is just how things are.&nbsp;</p><p>In the middle of all of this is Aunt Flora. She's wrapped in a gossamer dress of burnt orange that trails the ground. Necklaces of crystals hang from her throat, and a crown of laurel leaves freshly picked from the trees in the front sits on top of her head. She is the only one not wearing a mask. She approaches the teens with open arms.&nbsp;</p><p>""Welcome to my space! I <em>love</em>&nbsp;your energy!"" she cries. ""If you want, Eve is serving up some delicious libations that you can enjoy while I take a look at this poor little...""</p><p>Her face falters a bit as she looks at Sam.</p><p>""Dog?""</p>

She feels much better. She snuffles at Flora for a bit, exploring the funky scent of the woman.

			<p>Gror turns toward Ailinel and the others, ""You wish to talk, fine. Than speak quickly.""</p><p>""Quick I will be if you answer truthfully and directly Gror.""&nbsp;Nár's voice is stern and his tone gruff.&nbsp; ""Why did you and these sell swords attack us just now rather speak to us about your intent?""</p><p>Ailinel adds; ""It is you who have the greater need for talk, not us. You have wrongfully and unprovoked attacked us in the wild. It is you that need to convince us to talk, not the other way around. So speak, and be swift about it. Why should we spare you?""</p><p>""You wish to know why I did what I did? I knew from the moment I met you."" He says glaring at Ailinel and then Nár. ""That you had already made up your minds. You let you prejudice color your view of me. Elves and friends of Elves cannot be trusted. They betrayed my folk at the Battle of Five Armies and have been doing so for far longer."" His voice is layered with anger.</p><p>""Still waiting for a reason to talk with you..."" Ailinel says sarcastically.</p><p>Gror's tirade begins to make&nbsp;Nár think the Dwarf is unhinged and he feels an anger rise in him. ""You dare to presume to know our hearts and our minds without bothering to know us. Gror,&nbsp;I perceive that for too long you have entertained dark thoughts so that you can no longer distinguish between good or ill. If you continue on this road, you shall come to rue it. None of us are your enemies Gror unless you make us so. We are giving you a second chance if you will take it.""</p><p>""He has already made us his enemies, Nár. And two people are dead because of it. He might save his life by talking, but he'd better start talking soon.""</p><p>Grór considers his options, ""I may have been hasty in my actions. But it is true what I said, she did judge me on our first meeting. For that I do not wish to see her again. Young Tom is at the camp, he is bound, but safe. I will claim my share from the Troll horde as the only claim for my brother's death. This barrow I have lost. I will claim only the treasure of the Troll for my due rewards, and you shall see me no more.""&nbsp;</p><p>Tolerance: 0/1</p><p>Base TN for rolls: 16 (could be modified.)</p><p>Encounter Goal: End the fight, get information from Gror.</p><p>What is the goal that you are trying to get out of Gror here?</p><p>Successes: 2</p>

          <p>Alleria's uncharacteristic passiveness was not lost on Valentin. They had known the elf for some time now, and had always admired her confidence. &nbsp;The indecision and turmoil they saw in her was all too familiar; their childhood memories were tainted with it as they had tried to carry the burden their father had placed on their shoulders.

But it was not who I am, and for that reason it was not sustainable.""</p><p>""Things... may not have resolved the way I would have wanted them to, for which I have my regrets."" They continued, looking down for a moment. This was proving to be more difficult to discuss than they had thought it would be. When they looked up again, their gaze was filled with resolve.
