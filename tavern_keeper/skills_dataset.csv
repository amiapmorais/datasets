Consequently, he has continued to attend to the duties of the household, in the hopes that one day one of his grandchildren (or great-grandchildren) will return to the ancestral nest and prevent the line being broken.It is his habit to deliver a cooked breakfast to the rooms of owners-in-residence each morning at dawn... even if they've asked him not to. ",Persuasive 13
Trinket,"> walks around the mansion exploring. That's when he found it: the study. It was bigger than any home he had ever lived in. It had beautiful rugs over the hardwood floors, an ornately designed desk. He looked around at the bookshelves stuffed with books and trinkets. Oh thank the heavens, there was even bottles of liquor on the shelves. He moved jauntily to the sitting area near the fireplace. Cigars? Who was the person who had this place before them? This was insane. He called out ""Hey guys, I found my room!""Roll 1d100 for the most impressive trinket left on site. ",Trinket
Vigilant 10,">The one piece of art is a work of brass five feet high by ten feet high, riveted into the wall.  It depicts flames in an almost impressionist style, twisting and turning up from a bonfire.  Disturbingly, from some angles there are hints of distorted, screaming faces and contorted bodies threaded throughout, evoking the idea of someone being burned alive.  It is both grotesque and beautiful. ",Vigilant 10
Treasure,">3. The top level of the three storey structure can be spotted from the surrounding streets. The single room on that level is unusual. Accessible by a narrow (and somewhat rickety) spiral staircase the uppermost room of the mansion sits at the top of a octagonal turret, and has shuttered windows that can be opened to look across the Hold in every direction. The staircase delivers climbers to the north edge of the room, and in the centre, on a slightly raised platform, is a plush leather armchair, dusty and marked from age and use. Beside the chair, attached to a rod rising vertically from the platform, is a small wheel - turning the wheel rotates both the platform and the chair, affording the viewer a 360 degree view of the Hold, without having to leave the comfort of their seat.Roll 1d6-3. A positive number will result in the discovery of a treasure, the quality of which is better the higher the number. Negative numbers reveal nothing. ",Treasure
Specialist Amenities,">1. The original owner (and builder) of the mansion was Balon Daar, who also designed and oversaw construction of the Beacon. He built it as a near-exact replica of his ancestral family seat in Yndaros.It was kept quiet at the time, but Daar was one of the earliest people to commit suicide by leaping from the top of the Beacon. ",Specialist Amenities
Repairs,">7. Some impressive element of the mansion is in disrepair. It is not necessary but could be a great improvement.At the rear of the house, leading out into the garden, a large solarium had been constructed, with the ceiling and walls comprised of small panes of glass supported by a latticework of wooden framing. Within the structure were a vast variety of potted plants, some large and tree-like, others small and bushy, along with an assortment of herbs, creepers, flowers and grasses. A twisting gravel path led from the house proper to the garden, wending its way amongst the flora before depositing wanderers on a small lawn at the rear of the property. At some point, however, a number of the glass panes in the roof of the solarium had been broken, allowing the rain to run in, which had caused substantial water damage. Many of the plants too were somewhat worse for wear - some needed pruning, others repotting, and most needed water - it would certainly take a lot of work to put things right again. Roll 10D20 to determine the thaler cost of the repair. ",Repairs

The Rookery (as is to be expected); and whichever window is closest to where the Crown is being kept at any given time.Any crow he's questioned about this denies all knowledge as to what he's on about. Baumelo and his men are staying at the Court and Harp. One might expect a Twilight Friar and his retinue to sleep in monks' cells at the Sun Temple, both for convenient access to services the devout would naturally attend, and to save the Church money... rather than an inn with a notoriously pricey rate.Although if Baker and his chums are moonlighting as muscle for Aragina and her stringent guest policies, that might offset the total owing somewhat.Rumour has it that Baumelo himself has taken residence in the bedroom (purportedly) modelled after the personal chambers of First Father Jeseebegai at Templewall.  Maybe that little bit of hubris is the reason he picked Aragina's establishment... and not that it's a mere block away from the mansion...

Who was the prisoner? Was Merovech bringing him to you to be judged? If I may ask.” ",Riddle

Jot here, "" gestures towards Jot, ""believes them to be of a tribe with little purpose except the mean nature held  by all of that ilk. They may have bèen planning a raid on your farmlands or your animals. I believe that Merovech discovered a few orcs on this side, slew them, and was heading for the West bank to finish off the rest, when the cowardly orcs fired their darts and arrows, wounding or killing your men. As has said, this did not stop one final mighty strike that slew two with his only throwing spear. If there were any remaining goblins, the terror of these two men - even wounded and dying - sent their craven legs hotfooting away. Either the flow of the Anduin  itself, or a westerly breeze, pushed the boat back to this side. So no goblin scum was able to reach the bodies. In this way they have been preserved to return to their homeland. In that we are fortunate to have been their bier carriers. There's was a mighty last fight, with all honour to their memory.

State of the Pack,">Ellery stepped forward into a beam of sunlight that had managed to break through the cover of the woods. She breathed in the moment, allowing the cool air to fill her lungs while she sampled the surrounding scent. There were so many sounds and tastes, whiffs both subtle and heavy. So much life. But it wasn't complicated. She didn't have to mull over word choice and the effect they might have. She didn't have to worry about how certain reunions might go.Out here there was only instinct. The hunt.She flexed her paws, readying them for the flurry of action they were about to receive. The wolf, its coat a mottled mix of light and dark shades, was calm but ready to launch into motion like a compressed spring about to uncoil. Dark eyes looked to her packmates, their extraordinary forms just as familiar as their human ones. Her ears twitched. The scrape of leaves and the snapping of twigs in the distance drew her attention. Something larger than a rabbit was nearby. ",State of the Pack
Harness the Wolf,">Sometimes it was strange, stopping and seeing how much life has changed. In the world, with the pack. Within herself. It was disorienting sometimes. But this? The hunt? It was as easy and as natural as breathing. Just the way she liked it.The group of them moved silently, instinctively falling behind Ellery as they surveyed their surroundings, the scent of earth and wolf and....something else that stood out. It wasn't one of the smaller beasts, which was nice. While smaller prey was easy, it would take while out here to bring back enough for dinner. And she'd prefer to get home as quickly as possible. Twigs snapped, leaves crunched underfoot, and turned to its source, small snuffling sound as she tried to isolate....whatever that was. ",Harness the Wolf
Harness the Wolf,">At the mechanical snap, followed by the all too familiar yelp of pain, the mottled wolf raised her head, ears pricking with an alert clarity. Ellery's heart raced, looking from the source of the sound to her two packmates nearby. It wasn't them. Aria was at the lodge while Kurt and Speedy had set out to meet with the deserter. The quick assessment meant that the pack was safe and accounted for. Whatever had been trapped wasn't one of their own. She let out a breath that she wasn't aware of holding and let herself return to a relaxed readiness, hackles settling. With the apparent sense of danger elsewhere, Elle allowed herself to take notice of the state of the others - 's almost pained unease and Ben's comforting proximity. She moved closer, lowered her head and gave the greypelt a reassuring nudge. Unsure of 's distress, she resolved to not push further in that direction. Better to put some distance between themselves and the source of the agitation, especially since a sprung trap meant more intruders would be arriving.She disliked having Sheep in their territory as much as the others, if not more so. Their very presence presented a risk to the safety of everyone involved. But now was not the time to investigate or send a message. Whatever had been caught in the trap would have to face it's fate alone.Elle huffed and moved in the opposite direction, muzzle dropping to the ground to pick up a scent. They had a dinner to find and she had a pack to protect.  ",Harness the Wolf
Make a Challenge,">This was always a comfort to her, having packmates at her side. When she was hurting, they were always there and it was her duty to do the same. Even with packmates that were lost to them. The pained whining still echoed through the trees, he wasn’t dead yet. Which meant he was still hurt, hurt and alone and even though he was feral, he was one of their own. Regardless of what anyone said, he was still one of their own. While Ellery was redirecting her attention, turning back to the hunt, ….couldn’t let it go. She wasn’t going to leave Zachariah behind, not to meet such an undignified fate to the weapons of sheep.  That’s not the way things should be done. Taking a moment when she assumed attention was off her, she started to head in the direction of those continued sound of distress.

The Die of Equipment Fate!,">Odur has already surveyed the items on the table at which and are seated, and has hobbled off to pick through the next assortment of chaff from the innkeepers' adventuring days.  His injured leg is swaddled in bandages, and won't bend properly, so he sticks it out to one side as he toddles along.  He pushes aside a rotting canteen, then lifts a short sword encrusted with spots of rust like tiny barnacles.  The dwarf doesn't bother to hide his disapproval.""First pick o' piss all,"" he grumbles, tossing down the old weapon with a clatter of metal.  ""Didnae ye alewives keep anythin' for t'-- 'ere noo.""  Odur's eyes sparkle in the fat of his cheeks, and he dives into the pile to retrieve a cuirass of boiled leather in passable condition, along with its accompanying greaves and bracers.  The chest piece has... protrusions, fitted to the female anatomy; it's clearly an item that Gelda kept for herself.  But it's sturdy and clean, and if Odur's being honest with himself, he has some protrusions of his own.Maybe he can beat the leather down a bit, for shame's sake.Odur raps a knuckle against the hardened hide.  ""Suppose as I might make some use o' this,"" he concedes, as if he's doing the ladies a favor by relieving them of their gear.

Agility Challenge,">Odur shovels the breastplate, greaves and bracers into his arms.  Although the inkeepers have given him their blessing, he eyes them warily.  After all, it's daft to just give away perfectly good armor.  He must act before they change their minds.The dwarf turns suddenly and scuttles into the kitchen with his prize, like a crippled and overweight rat heading back to its hole.Once there, he begins the process that he hopes will refashion the hard leather cuirass into a somewhat less feminine shape.  Odur heats water at the kitchen hearth, makes several trips to fill a large basin, then dunks the breastplate and leaves it to soak.  Once the hide has softened, he slops it onto the floor and lays into the ghost of Gelda's bosom with a tenderizing mallet.  It's messy, sweaty work, but in the end he manages to deflate the breastplate to a contour more in keeping with his own paps.  While you wouldn't know it was a female dwarf's armor, there's still clearly something off about it.With a groan, Odur struggles back to his feet.  He drags the soggy cuirass over beside the hearth and leaves it to dry in a puddle of water and grit.  His work has kept him in the kitchen for some time, and so fortunately for all, he's missed 's blithe declaration that they'll be going after the dark dryad possessing Old Nook.

Yasmin base Will,">OOC: Just having my early morning breakfast coffee now, so ctaching up with things. :) I think a pleasure roll in the context you've used it (i.e. slave use of a white silk girl) would work as an opposed dice roll between relevant atributes/skills, rather than against a target number. My understanding is a target number applies when you're trying to achieve a result against an abstract something. i.e. trying to scale a wall, you roll vs an appropriate difficulty number, as the wall is an abstract something without stats, as opposed to a player character. Where you have an 'opposed action' against a player character, you both roll suitable attributes/skills. So in this case it would be your Pleasure skill versus Yasmin's Will. Her base Will would have a penalty applied because she has failed her slave belly test just earlier, which makes it easier for you. As a rule of thumb I'd use the table of successes on page 67 in respect of the fail of my slave belly roll previously to determine the level of the difficulty factor applied from page 66, on a like for like basis. i.e. the first 'solid success' of 1-4 points fail difference on the table would equate to the first category of +5 difficulty on the other table and so on.  Yasmin failed her slave belly test by 2 points and so that would fall in the 1-4 solid 'fail' which presents her now with a +5 difficulty factor to her resistance to your Pleasure roll. Hope that makes sense? I suspect with that sort of penalty the overall result will be the same as when you rolled against a base difficulty number.  So, you have a Pleasure skill of 16 which is enhanced by the difficulty of +5 because Yasmin is already aroused by what you did earlier, giving you a score of 21. Yasmin rolls her 4D6+2 Will to try and control herself. Which I'll roll now. :)The only other thing to mention is it's probably best to make things like 'Pleasure' rolls before writing a post, just in case for example you wrote a long post describing a success only to then roll a failure... ;) It's perfectly permissable to roll for both of us to speed things up and get an immediate result of course.  So let's see how our 'frigid' heroine withstands those hands on her sex...

Spark,">The MorganThe pub fit like a glove.He didn't mean that in a positive sense. It was like a baseball glove, a cumbersome pitcher's mitt, awkward in its faux-Irish Americana. He'd known a dozen places back home that the Morgan was trying to imitate, but it just wasn't the same; the ceiling spars weren't oak that had been marinading in a peat bog since the Middle Ages; the glass didn't have grime on it dating back to the Easter Rising; the seats hadn't been polished by the trousers of miners and dock workers for untold decades. There was Guinness on tap, Jamesons on the shelf and Flogging Molly on the jukebox, though, which seemed to keep most of the clientele happy. Hell, he'd never expected to be in this position – he was supposed to be working here, not running the place. But after what had happened with Uncle Royce, what choice did he have?That wasn't to say that just because the role was uncomfortable he didn't like it. Like Ravenswood itself, it was the people that made it great. Rian smiled as he heard Aunt Jingfei call out the order to the new waitress, Grace. Jingfei was an angel – he hadn't expected her to take up her apron and spatula in the pub kitchen again, but he was sure glad to have her around. If only he could convince her to serve bangers 'n' mash instead of bangers 'n' spiced jasmine rice.Greg was talking his ear off about the prospects at the dog tracks again, trying to convince Rian to put down a stack on Direwolf, a keen little greyhound named after one of the local capes. Wonder if there'll ever be a dog named after the Wall? he mused. Speaking of things that didn't fit right... Rian shook his head, trying to put the thoughts of costumes, powers, and weird totemic marriages out of his mind. He glanced along the bar towards the girl with the fountain of colourful hair who didn't look quite old enough to be in here, as he often did when he felt his thoughts turning inwards like that. The kid had a way of looking at you that could make you feel like she knew exactly what was going on in the convoluted catacombs of your mind. Rian didn't know whether that was reassuring or deeply unsettling. The espresso machine that squatted like a chromed motorcycle engine on the bar finished gurgling, and he topped the cup off with a flourish of foamed milk that could, charitably, be described as heart-shaped and a pinch of powdered chocolate. He was learning on the job when it came to barista-ing. Rian slid the cappuchino across the varnished wood of the bar to Isabel. “On the house, Izzy,” he said with a warm smile, kindly not adding you look like you could use it. With those bags under her eyes, the kid always looked like sugar and caffeine were the only things keeping her going.Crack!Rian's gaze was torn away by the sound, fearing a dropped tray of drinks, porter-soaked carpet, drycleaning bills from the customers, that didn't seem to be the problem. It took him a moment to parse the situation, both what he was seeing and the swirl of moods spreading through the Friday night crowd like ink in water. The lascivious smugness oozing from the grinning student; the envy and approval from his mates; the waves of disgust and disapproval silently filling the other women in the room; and the whistling kettle of fury that was was , heat in her head exceeding the warmth of the hand-print on her backside.“Oh, hell,” Rian muttered to himself. Hastily he slapped his palm on the bar and vaulted over it, his well-built, athletic form landing easily on the other side. He raced to the door and flung it open, letting in a draft of the honking, rattling, garrulous city air. Standing to one side like an usher he looked over at Grace and raised an eyebrow. He'd seen her fight. There was no doubt how this was going to go for the handsy bastard. ",Spark
Spark,">The MorganMore than anything, was tired.Last night's patrol had been a rough one -- she could feel the fresh bruises on her back, on top of the ones from last week that the mirror told her were just now turning yellow. Then she'd put in a full day at school, missed the bus and had to run to the bar... where she showed up ten minutes late for her shift. Luckily, she and had a bit of an understanding, but it still been a rough start to the evening, and the jackasses at the long table near the dart boards had been fucking with her for over an hour now.The waitress' statuesque frame was beautifully silhouetted by her black tights and form-fitting, long-sleeved black turtle neck. Some people would say her garments were partially to blame for the attention she was receiving from the college shitheads, but Kennedy often felt those same people needed a knee in the groin from time to time to get them to wake up and realize what the hell year it was.Her blue eyes widened when the smack resounded throughout the bar, and the glasses of beer on her tray swayed a bit when she stopped abruptly, then did a one-eighty so she could face the brazen idiot who'd just slapped her on the backside. As she turned, other patrons could see the man's handprint -- it had been quite the spank.""You like my ass?"" the woman heard herself saying, a buzzing in her ears almost blocking out her own voice. Suddenly she was smiling, but her eyes blazed brightly as she set down her tray on an empty table. ""Well do you?"" she pressed, walking straight towards the man and his still laughing but now slightly uncomfortable friends. ""Kind of hurt, you know? You must like it rough. Do you like it rough? Like this?""Grace's movements then were hard to follow -- at least for those not used to seeing her in action. She closed the distance in a wink, then slammed the no longer laughing asshole to the wall with one of her worn Dr. Marten lookalike buckle shoes. She stood for a moment on one shapely leg, pinning him there by the neck as she clenched her fists and bared her teeth. When several of the man's friends shouted and got up from their table, Grace released the purple-faced moron, but then grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out of his seat. Pivoting her hips, she yanked the man over top of her and sent him flying, ass over teakettle, to land on the bar's floor heavily as beer, fish and chips, and more went flying.Crouching down beside the dazed man, Kennedy's smile was gone. ""Listen. Don't touch my ass again, creep. Got it? The cops in his shithole town might look the other way if your rich parents fill their pockets, but I'll fucking break your arm next time. Cool?""Standing, Grace exhaled heavily and didn't bother looking at her boss as she took off her bar apron and handed it to him as she walked out, her dark braid swinging. ""Sorry Rian. It's been a day."" ",Spark
Spark,">The MorganThere was something about Fridays at the Morgan that felt like coming home. The faint smell of cigar smoke that lingered in from outside, the chatter of familiar voices, the waves of emotions that rolled over her like an ocean. The giggling and shrieking of the out-of-towners, the boyish boasting of the college kids at a table some ways away, Auntie calling orders out to an exhausted, frazzled Grace. It was hectic and lively and just so...Ravenswood. Her Ravenswood, at least. Isabel’s eyes flicked up from the napkin she was doodling on when Rian slid a coffee her way.

Damn, damn it all. She wheeled around in her stool, watching Rian vault over the bar, getting up to see Grace grab the creep and slam him into the floor. He went sprawling and the table of women - the hen do - started to scream. Izzy understood the panic, it was completely rational, but it made her heart race. Heart palpitations that were hers but not hers. The conflict was over(more or less), and the boys were busy nursing their wounds, but these women just...didn’t know how things went down around here.

What he wouldn't give for a quiet night... it was almost as if cramming people together in a room with alcohol as they unwound from their weeks was a bad idea! Perish the thought.“Ah, sorry for the wee donnybrook, folks,” he called out across the bar, laying the sunny Irish brogue on thick. “Some lads can't hold their drink – or remember the good manners their mammies taught 'em,” he said as the young men trouped out, his cheerfully tone at odds with the dark look he gave them. As they exited he grimaced at the gob of saliva one of them left by way of a tip, and shot a glance to Greg, who'd paused at the top of the stairs as the commotion started, sending a mute appeal for him to man the bar for a minute.Rian stepped out onto the street, closing the Morgan's door behind him and faced the band of louts grimly. “Oh, aye, it's a bit of fun laying hands on people, is it? I like a bit of that meself.” His leather jacket creaked as he folded his arms, feet planted on the doorstep of the bar, looking implacable. He met all four of their gazes levelly. “Now, fook off back to daddy and keep your dirty paws off my people.”But Top-Knot couldn't leave it there. He had to threaten Grace. Rian's eyes turned into chips of green ice as his hand shot out and grabbed the boy by his unfortunate hair choice. “Ah, now. Now ye've done it. That's an apology ye owe her.” Rian rolled his wrist, twisting Top-Knot's scalp painfully. “Make it heart-felt, why don'tcha?” ",Intimidate (Normal 3 + Jaw 3)

They'll be blown far off course doubtless, but once the interference dies down he should start getting their feeds back. Still, he's never had so many go dead at once. There will be losses from this, for sure. And every time he loses one of his eyes, it's like losing a part of himself; the sensory-emotional connection is a strong one.""I've never seen a duster come up that fast before"", he thinks as he brings himself back to the moment and tries to look for something pragmatic to do.

We still weren't getting a signal on our phones, but we were happier when we started down the path through the woods. Some shelter was better than nothing. I was proud of Gemma, because I thought she would want to turn around way before that. But she kept smiling at me, and held my hand for a while. We stopped for a brew before the path opened up onto the road again. I had something for us to eat, and went to get some dry twigs to get a small fire going. Just to keep us warm while we sat down.When I got back, Gemma wasn't there, but her stuff was, so I imagine she had gone to relieve herself. I started on the fire, and just as I gave a satisfied grunt of success I felt an enormous pain.Something struck me on the back of the head and all I could see was mud and stars before I lost consciousness.  Spending 1 Resolve.

The ground was treacherous, slick mud covered me and my clothes. Though I found it a little bit funny that the mud was washed off in the rain before long. That's strange.

Persuasion,">Considers Gunvar for a moment, ""I see, my lord, you test us a little more. Good. I am not offended. It is pleasing to see that you look for assurances of our abilities. Perhaps I can demonstrate my skills of deduction and analysis?   I would ask you to consider a small puzzle I solved when I travelled in the East. Indulge me, when I say that it is an old tale of an Eastern King who executed nine prisoners. The king started by tying them to posts set out in a square pattern in his courtyard -  a grid of 3 rows of 3 men in a line. Then the king rode his horse past them and cut off each head as he charged down in a single straight line. It started a bit like this, ""  sketched a grid to show how the nine condemned men were 'posted'. and then he continued,"" of course it would not be  a puzzle without a twist. Bring in your most capable servant, that weaselly fellow who met us at the gate might do. Is he clever enough to solve my puzzle do you think?""(OOC: I am going to assume that Gunvar is intrigued enough to permit this)""Now, if you remember,  the king charged along in a straight line, beheading all the men on his first run. So he may have made this trail first..."". ""After the first run, he had to twist his horse around to face a new way and he started his second charge, beheading prisoners in the new line of charging."""" and he continued until all were beheaded. Tired with his robust sense of justice, he looked at the courtyard and counted the number of times he had turned and charged. He saw he had turned four times and made five charge-lines in the sand. Let us see if you employ a fool my , this bit is easy, can your lackey draw out the 5 straight lines with the places the king turned his horse around as he executed the nine men?""(The lackey should have no problem doing this.)"" and now my puzzle, the king asked his court if he could do the same job with less turns and charges - is it possible?"" 's aim here is to amuse , and to show him that is a brighter associate than his best lackey. ",Courtesy
Persuasion,">""Ah, , once again you show your careful mind, with its intricate attention to detail and its ability to puzzle things through.You may need further convincing of our ambitions. I am not sure you have seen the extent of our plans. You ask for evidence of greatness, we seek great people to join us. You are clearly a strong and wise member of King Bard's council. You are versed deep in the intrigues of this region. This alone would be enough to recommend you to us an important - nay, vital, - ally. We have no foothold in the city except a sound financial and commercial set up.To demonstrate my trust in your standing and capability, you should know that we have already secured many of the stepping stones of our what we refer to as the Great Enterprise. Know this, Lord, when I reveal this you will become a confidant of the highest order. When the dragon fell on Esgaroth, we received a setback: we had almost 'owned' that weak fool, the Master at that time. Another year or two and we would have had him snared in debt and under our complete control. We have 'interests' in Dorwinion and beyond in Rhun; When recounted his story of the eastern king, he is speaking of a real king in a real court: one who is allied to our vision, as you might be - of course, he is a king - Bard is too intransigent to acquire. But I am convinced that you have the ability to influence him. It is why we wish to ally ourselves with you.But there is more!  From the East to Dale is not even half of our ambition. Are you prepared for GREAT risk and GREAT reward? "" (courtesy here to maintain Gunvar's attention & interest) ",Courtesy
Persuasion,">Continues, "" Moving from Dale to the west, we have two routes. First, Do you really believe that our elf is in Mirkwood by accident? Here we are  trying to get a very bold operation. If successful, we will have a way through that forest, guarded and guided by the blessings of the Elf King. We will secure his non-interference in the affairs of Dale and Esgaroth with riches that he has a weakness for. Of course this is not a finished project, it would be helpful if we had access to the wealth of Erebor's gem operations. The Elf king will need a particular sort of bribe. We know you have dwarf connections - how serious might they be? If you think I am being unguarded in comments, it is simply because now is the time for hard and clear talking and decisions. You are right to be cautious: but honesty with each other is paramount now. Perhaps you can feel more confident to trust us since you can see our ambitions?The second part? I spoke of two routes past the forest. We are already operating across the Narrows. travelled that way only last year. The carvings we delivered reveal that. But it is a longer route, and the forest would be better and more secret. Either way we will move ahead.Past the forest, we are based in the land of the Beornings. A man of your obvious good taste will not likely have travelled THERE!. They are simpletons, we control their foodstuffs and wool trade. Their menfolk make impressive bodyguards - loyal to the end and as easy to shape as the oaks they live amongst. I would be hiding the truth if I said we had safe passage across mountains. That is a further problem to solve.But after that we travel further through empty lands, small simple towns and rustic folks - to the Great Sea. Can you imagine it my Lord. An empire of trade and wealth from there, through here and on into the East.  this is our Great Enterprise. Commercial control of all of the North... and without the silly costs of armies, or the wastages of war. With this wealth we will control it all. What say you now? Are our ambitions worthy of consideration?"" (OOC: another very poor roll!

Great Bow,">Again to set an example of archery in combat I will loose off an arrow at Gunvar's group: but the numbers are going to be against it.Zaken, pauses, readies his bow briefly, and fires in Gunvar's direction. In the rush it is likely to be a poorly aimed shot, and it is a bit smoky, so a normal arrow shot has a TN of 12 +Parry rating of target. I would have to say that the movement and need for speed should make the shot 'hindered' (or just extra difficult) so the basic TN of 12 would be increased to either 14 or 16 before raising it further by adding the targets Parry score. If Gunvar's Parry was about 5  this means that Zaken's final TN would be either 14+5 = 19 or even 16 +5 = 21. I am going to assume that since Zaken was also daunted earlier at the chasm it is fairer to say that this shot should be a total of TN = 21. With a bow skill of 2d6 to add to the basic 1d12 this will have to be some shot!After the shot: actually it wasn't too bad. If Zaken had rolled a little more, or if his shot was not hindered by the environment, he might have made it. Of course, normally he could add a hope point too (favoured Body +6) and I think the shot would be enough for Gunvar to squeal in pain: but crossing the chasm earlier means Zaken is daunted and cannot add any Hope points. The arrow flies off over Gunvar's head - perhaps the noble twitches in fright, and glares across to see his supposed ally attacking him! Does that shake Gunvar's  resolve a little? Will the coward break and try to run? It will depend on the new arrivals on the staircase behind the treacherous lord. (Over to the LM here!)To Ramis: You can also attack any of the ten, by using with his sword (skill =2 ). The basic TN you will need depends on the stance you attack with. This basic TN is then added to the parry rating of the man he is facing to get a final TN. s attack roll is Sword: 1d12 +2d6. Good luck!Then can have a go with his mattock: I expect you can leave Brian to run the attacks of a few of s stone guards and the return attacks from the group of ten.again apologies if this post was not needed: but you said you had not attacked anyone in this game before.

CaA with Str,">In his dreams, flew through the night air on the edge of a silver dagger, chasing, being chased, fighting or tussling in a more intimate but no less life or death way with a blue-skinned she-devil. He caressed the box as he muttered to himself in his drowsy nightmare-ride, awakening only slowly at 's cries and the glittering of glamour-lights in the barn.Shivering free from the cloak of sleep was awakening into pain. An ache like an axe-wound split his head all at once, rage flowing like blood from the imagined wound into his brain. “No! No fucking arrows!” Kellen hissed through gritted teeth as he hopped with startling agility to his feet from prone. “No pissant sewing needle swords! It's a waste! A waste of good red vein-hot wine!” Clutching the box, tucking it under his arm, Kellen burst into a scuttling sprint towards the three ruffians – but not straight towards them. He veered sharply to the side, to one of the fragile looking support beams that held aloft the upper floor of the barn, groaning under the weight of mouldering hay. He slammed his shoulder into the beam, hoping to bring the stack down on top of the figures he blearily recognised as hostile...But either he was weaker than he thought after the arduous trip (and not because he was naturally as muscular as a plucked chicken, not at all) or the beam was stronger, because he bounced off with a whuff of dislodged breath and a fresh bruise on his shoulder.""Is that... is that Nordvale cedar? That's... that's surprisingly sturdy,"" he wheezed, shaking his head and starting to back away from the intruders with a sickly smile as the odds came clearer to him. ",CaA with Str
Stabbim,">Garrard used the seconds it took him to struggle into his clothes - dawdling only as much as he dared - to consider the situation. A part of the old preacher wanted to let them take him. Take the key to Kellen's box to a deep dark cell in Norden, take his lashes and negotiate his freedom from there or else slip these thugs on the road. Leave the Hen in peace.The problem was while Dulvert seemed a businesslike sort he didn't trust the man's assurances that they wouldn't want more.Curse it he was a talker, not a fighter, and even with the drop on them the odds were against the wiry road arbiter, and yet his chances only got worse once they flanked him. How long till they found Soe's gift clutched in his hand? Even now the clothes that hid it were finding their way out of his hands and onto his back. No, this was going to end in a fight, and a short but brutal show of force here and now was the best his odds were going to be.This was exactly why gambling didn't rank amongst the er'Shar vices. Garrard's tight-pursed father Jurah had instilled in him that the only way to profit by gambling is to be the house. Here Dulvert had all the cards, and Garrard scarcely had the shirt on his back.Feigning stumbling as he squirmed a foot into one of his books, Garrard took a step forward, caught himself, and with a roar of sudden fury sent the blade in a glittering backhand arc up toward his captor's throat.Garrard felt the blade catch, but then too quickly it came free. A glancing blow, Trinity turn their backs. Garrard glanced back, bracing himself to back-pedal at the thrust of Dulvert's long knife, but instead of the cruel smile he expected Garrard saw the man clutching at his throat, trying hopelessly to hold a gaping wound shut as blood poured down his chest in tidal pulses. Dulvert's breath came in gurgles like a drowning man's last gasp and his eyes were wide in shock, the whites showing all around his pinprick pupils. Soe kept her knives sharp!The bounty hunter collapsed to his knees as the life left his eyes and Garrard turned to meet a noseless ugly face, wearing an expression as shocked as his own.

Overcome with Str,">“Down you go,” Kellen cackled as he saw Nathan deftly kick the ladder away and the brute at the top take a hard landing. His mind started to fly about, searching for ways out of the barn, opportunities to turn the tables on their foes... but with a hideous gravity, his thoughts started to turn back to the blade in the box. This was a desperate fight. He needed the, hah, edge, the black knife would give him. But it was locked away, curse that meddling whisky priest! Kellen fingers the box. The lock wasn't that sturdy, really. The wood of the box itself was not all that tough. A good, hard fall might just break it apart...He darted to the edge of the loft, hoisting the box above his head and fixing his gaze on Fenrei. “She's already tasted you... she wants more!” he whispered with a unnatural cruelty in his voice. Something seemed to shift inside the container as he brought it down, hurling it towards the injured man as if an occult sympathetic connection existed between wound and wounder. It didn't matter too much to Kellen if he hit Fenrei or the box shattered on the barn floor, so long as the knife was freed – it didn't occur to him until after it was thrown that it would be out of his grasp. “No!” ",Overcome with Str

""Foul sorcery!"" he cried, backing away from the dying man.Garen, though, the lanky one with the bow and the ratty, limp hair, was made of sterner stuff. He drew his bow again -- but this time, he'd lit an oil-soaked arrow and fired it straight at the load. The flaming missile streaked across the room -- and thunked into a beam above Nathan's head ineffectually, fizzling out seconds after it struck the wood.Some of you know I very much favor player-facing rolls in Fate. There aren't very many instances where I think the GM should roll, but this is one of them -- an NPC / foe trying to create an advantage vs. the environment. Failure!

Roll,">Garrard looked at the tip of Lom's axe and swallowed hard. It was a cruel thing, dull and notched - more a bludgeon than an edge. Not a weapon that killed cleanly or swiftly. He glanced at Soe. The Lyrian did have a bad habit of dragging trouble to the doors of those he called his friends.Lady of Ways I'm going to have to kill him. How in the stygian depths am I going to kill an armed man who sees it coming?The road-arbiter's hand shook as he held the knife out in front of him and retreated a step or two past the still-dying Dulvert. If he'd doubted that Dulvery would leave peacefully he was now certain Lom wouldn't. ""There's no need for any more violence friend."" He jerked his head at Dulvert ""you might yet save him if you act now."" It was a poor lie.Instinctively Garrard thumbed open the lid of his hip flask to take a pull and steady his nerves before the violence started. A cheap brown spirit too harsh to name washed into his mouth, and already he could feel his blood warm. His blood warm and his mind cool, and all at once Lyria blessed her servant with a moment's clarity.Darting a step forward and stooping, Garrard pressed his teeth into his lower lip in emulation of an 'f' sound, sending his mouthful of raw-tasting spirits spraying in a half-mist straight at the still advancing Lom - more specifically straight at the naked flame of his lantern, and at the ugly face illuminated behind it.

All three wagons are INCREDIBLY similar in construction, size, shape, and the tarps all appear to have been cut from the same cloth.Both the tavern and the building next to it have side doors. There's a very old sign hanger above the door in the building opposite the tavern. The door is painted in a dark grey-brown which peels a little around the edges of the wood slats. The side door in the tavern has a stool next to it and appears to open in half, much like the door  at the cafe Bree delivered her game to earlier today.Bree, as you're looking around you notice a symbol on the tavern's side door that looks like a rose with three leaves on its stem.Jal-bek, as you look over these wagons you can tell one of them sits a few inches lower than the other two as if the load in it has more weight to it.

Shipname 1,">Putting it all togther:Haf is from Lostwater, of the Circle of the Wurm, in the Barrier Islands, where it's common to learn to sail before you can walk. When she came of age, she joined the crew of the Thistlethorn, under Captain Mona, and where Masias, or Masi, was the first mate. Masi was as proud as the sea has salt, but had some reason too—she knew her ship and sail. The two were initially at loggerheads, but time and tide turned them into fast friends. And then it all shattered. One night, Haf went down to bunk, and awoke to screams and fire. Somehow they'd been set upon by a shipful of Broken during the night. They killed the captain and tore the ship apart. Masi hid Haf, and as the ship burnt and died, Haf could only watch and hold onto a spar as it drifted away. Days followed nights, of Haf looking at the sea, and trying to kick towards the impossibly distant shore. She made it ashore and promptly lost consciousness. When she awoke, it was to the smell of fish on a fire—being tended by a wanderer called Kabeera. Haf didn't know if Kabeera was speaking to her or the birds, half the time, what she did know was that she would have died if it wasn't for this mad, strange woman. Kabeera nursed her back to health, and as she did, she taught her the language of the crows, how to ask them questions, and see the future in their wings. When she had recovered, Haf swore two vows—to aid Kabeera if she should ever ask, and vengeance for her shipmates, and her lost captain.

Her parents were lost to a storm at sea when she was a young child—for as long as she can remember, she has been raised by the village, but especially the mystic, Kabeera - who has looked young for as long as anyone could remember. Growing up, as far as Haf knew, everyone learnt to speak to crows and ask them tidings, just as they learnt of tide and sails.

Masias, or Masi, had come aboard at the same time, and was designated lookout.Masi had a swagger about her—she was as proud as the sea has salt, which made her and Haf begin as rivals ... but time and tide turned them into fast friends. It turned out that part of Masi's swagger was because she was the daughter of the chieftain of Longhall, a small village of the Barrier Islands. As was her village's custom, Masi was doing a turn at sea, before she returned home to take up her duties. A year passed and the Thistlethorn brought Masi back, and she invited the crew to celebrate her Hometide Feast. It was one of the best nights of Haf's life—full of song and stories, and best of all was when Haf and Masi snuck away to the hillside to speak of dreams and fall asleep under the stars. Tides turn quickly: they awoke to smoke and screams. With everyone invited to the Feast, there was nobody to keep watch, and nobody to raise the alarm when the Broken set upon the village leaving killing in their wake. Haf and Masi arrived too late to do anything but put out fires and bury the dead. Masi was suddenly chieftain, tasked with rebuilding a village in ruins. And before she left, Haf swore on iron that she would avenge their double loss—of ship and of hearth.  ",Place name 1

Roll,">Nathan is surprised to find the bunker is built for a single nuclear family. He calls the zoning commissioner's office saying that he's looking into the zoning regulations for bunkers in the city, and what would be required for constructing a bunker. (If there's official paperwork required, he'll ask for a rough estimate about how many have been built in the Cleveland area.) If he gets some resistance, he notes that he's trying to save the life of a kidnapped child and not asking for personal information on the bunker-owners, just for general numbers. (Which I think are usually a matter of public record in most U.S. cities?)(I guess this is a bureaucracy roll? Not sure.)Then, with a sense that he's gotten all he can from the Church website, it strikes him that they still haven't gotten a license plate for the kidnappers' car. He connects to the traffic camera system and first backs up the entire database of footage from the night previous (for six hours following the abduction) to the cloud. He checks how many cars were flagged as speeding within a 10 block radius of the abduction site around 6:30-7:00pm the evening previous. (Widening his search to from 5:45 to 7:45 if necessary.) Presumably there's not that many, and he should be able to check the video for each to see whether it's a late-model tan Ford Taurus. If he can't then, he'll grab some free car-recognition software like this and and set it to work on the entire city's speedcam network for the night previous, looking for cars of that model/make/color. He sets up a script to pull the plates for each flagged capture of a late Ford Taurus. He sets up a database where flagged Tauruses can be tracked, where the license plates can be stored, and then, as an afterthought, sets up a second script to read off the database and map it to a private Google Map. There will obviously be false positives there, but by paying attention to which routes could connect back to the abduction site, he's hoping they can get lucky. (And that, once they have a suspected car, they can run the plates and confirm it with some connection to Lewiston.) Oh, and of course all this is running on the city's in-house server, which he set up a few years ago, so that it can run in the background and be accessible from anywhere. He'll have the map update automatically every five minutes. Then something clicks in his mind, and he texts his sister:Hey Jas, Thanks for your help last night. We got that device sent off to a lab for analysis. Between you and me, the owner's still missing. Oh, and can I ask you something? Does it sound realistic someone with one of those devices could go without a steroid injection for 4-5 days? When we talked, it sounded like you thought 24-48 hours was a likelier timeframe, but we were told 4-5 days before deprivation would become a life-or-death issue. Does that sound right, for someone using steroids for ""several life-threatening conditions""? I suspect our contacts (victim's family) aren't being completely forthcoming with us. The roll below is for the coding/scripting involved. I assume it's routine stuff for him, but it's your call!! Oh, and I don't know if you need a Bureaucracy roll since he's just requesting public information (AFAIK), but I can do of those too.  ",Roll
Roll,"> Oh, it's okay. I just thought I might actually have a quick in-character scene with Odd, but we can just say I missed him. Nathan picks up the book, start skimming it, and immediately find myself going down internet rabbit-holes searching out all the crazy references in the book.  But let's say Nathan does spend the evening pulling out a list of specific keywords that seem to be specific to the Balfour cult's rhetoric and then did some extensive web searching for postings from Cleveland IPs that include those keywords. It takes him the evening to refine the keyword list to exclude other Christian groups, and of course probably some of the church people are using VPNs, but it's what is doable for right now. He can leave spider bot searching.   He's trying to get an index of IP addresses that correspond to members of the cult, so we have addresses for as many members as possible. (He's still thinking it's a publicity/recruitment scam, and thinking maybe someone else in the congregation might be helping hide the kid.)Also, as a preparatory measure:He also prepares a script to probe the Church's website, trying passwords (at first from the keyword list and from specific words germane to the case, like the name and date of the kidnap victim). He's masking the attempt using a non-logging VPN that makes it look like his IP is in Russia, and all he's really trying to do is access the  log of visitors and their IPs, again to try build a partial roster of church members (and people interested in the church) within the state. He doesn't launch this script: it's illegal, and kind of a last-ditch thing. But he sets it up on a freemium cloud server so that he can—again, from behind a VPN on his phone—launch it at any time.  I guess this takes a Computer skill roll, so I'll do that now. ",Roll

Library Use 20 ,">James' research homes in on the Plagues and how some of them only affected the Egyptians but not the Israelites. >>Plague of Flies – Exodus 8:20-32 The Bible says that this plague only effected the land of the Egyptians and not the land of Goshen where the Israelites lived (Exodus 8:22).<<Hmm... this resonates with the odd fly episode that we witnessed outside the Eggstravaganza diner. Balfour's car was completely free of flies. Like in the lore, the righteous true believer is spared. He thinks.He also verifies the two main references to the death of the firstborn child. -One is the sacrifice that God demands of Abraham to test his faith. Abraham does not hesitate and is about to slaughter his son Isaac, but God stays his hand and spares the son. By showing no hesitation, Abraham proves his unflinching faith to God.This could be consistent with a staged kidnapping. A preacher could twist that, and a subsequent liberation of the kidnapped firstborn, as a sign of a sacrifice done willingly and stopped by God's will. He thinks.-The second mention is in the Tenth Plague: >>The tenth and final plague was the death of the firstborn of all the people and animals. This was a plague on the Israelites and the Egyptians. The plague consisted of the firstborn being killed on a certain night. To avoid the punishment the people would kill a sacrificial lamb (sheep or goat) and paint the door posts of the house with the blood of the lamb. When the Lord passed through the land, He would not kill the firstborn of the houses that had shown their trust in His provision of salvation.<<He thinks. So, here we have God's vengeful angel descending to kill first borns. The righteous are offered a chance to be spared through the revelation of the warding procedure to mark oneself as true believer - the lamb sacrifice and the blood mark on the door. In Balfour's website, this symbol appears in conjunction with the procedure:James decides to research the symbol meaning and significance in the religious reference books of the Library.

Good Impression,">Khadn remained uncharacteristically quiet as they entered the drawing room, his mouth open a little and eyes a lot. Whatever it lacked in technical acumen, the mural stirred his imagination. He could just picture himself swinging from the rigging of one of those flying galleons with a dagger clenched in his tusks, skittering up a wisp-thin turret to rescue a maiden as lovely and green as spring shoots, duelling one of those statuesque servitors on a marble courtyard. Oh yes, these landsmen had an way of making dreams come to life!The libraries and scriptoriums they were eventually lead through were of less interest to him, smelling too much of dust, drudgery and hard intellectual work. Those labouring scribes reminded him of his early life scraping at the mud, before the call to adventure had blown its clarion in his ears and lifted the scales from his eyes. He was vaguely tempted to push over a torch sconce or two, set a little fire about to give them some interest in their day. The master of the house, it turned out, was both disappointing and interesting. Khadn had expected something grander than this underfed buzzard, but there was something about him that hinted at the potential for fulfilling those stories of landsman witches he had heard of, men who could conjure winds and bend steel with their wills. Wanting to make a good impression on the man for the other's sake, the goblyn pressed his palms to his scale-armoured breast and bowed low before sinking gracefully to his knees on one of the cushions. With great dignity and respect he intoned:“Wisdom-keeper of the men of old, your treasure-house of learning honours this humble soldier with its hospitality. I am , Kholopukil of the Marrow Knights, a guardsman on the wall that keeps the dusk-watch at the world's end, knight of the road, and proud to be the companion and sword arm for the esteemed Vals Dratha and hopeful pilgrim . Never in all my days have I seen such knowledge gathered in one place – why, a student would need ten heads to hold it all!” ",Good Impression
Whose Six Sons Are These,">Khadn felt unsettled by reciting the prophecy – what had initially seemed the ramblings of an over-smart org took on a greater, darkre significance when repeated and reinforced by a man so drenched in the trappings of wisdom.“So... the Nasumi are not merely gone... not merely dead... but ghosts and night-walkers? Spirits leave no tracks. Do you say that our quest is hopeless, wise one?” he asked glumly. “Unless you are one who can speak to the dead.”The talk of primordial oceans and beginnings was obscure to him, but endings... from the Wall of Broken Bones, one could see the end of the world on a clear day. “The deep sea comes before the world... dust comes after,” the knight mused, the absinthe-drink giving making poetical sprites buzz in his head. “Time is the mill that grinds all things, and battle turned the lands of the dusk into the Waite of dust. Wise one, spoke to me, in his broken fashion, of a temple drowned in dust, beneath the Battlewaite. Secrets of his people's ancestors carved in stone. Does that have meaning to you?”He neglected to mention that 'Ghol's tablet might be the key. It seemed to him that a man who had pinned so much knowledge to the shelves of this archive might be insatiable for more. He cocked his head as Dratha and Mern discussed the Book of Six Sons (a reasonable number of sons, he thought). “Dangerous? Is it very heavy and prone to fall on heads? Are the pages poisoned?” ",Whose Six Sons Are These
Recognize a Marrow Knight,">The tolling bell struck like a flash flood, drowning the flow of Lyni's thoughts. She looked up, then down at the texts scattered around her. Tomes lay open, scrolls unrolled, even a copper tablet lay against one of the stacks for easy consultation. Myr anatomy, speculation on Mhulak alchemical knowledge, a text on the Baalfr Galachos, a translated travel memoir of a Dunsain adventurer, an illustrated guide to common birds of the Farlands. Glancing at her notes, she could mostly account for her reasoning for consulting most of these texts. The presence of an analysis of Ghanish histories, however, was truly mysterious.She tidied as quickly as she could. Without time to replace the documents properly, she at least made sure each was closed and piled to protect against accidental destruction. A hurried process, and soon she was hurrying to Mern's sitting room.Just outside the curtains, she took a moment to compose herself.Lyni slid into the room. Her back was straight, her head slightly bowed. Her steps, all her movements, seemed at once sinuous and deliberate. At odds, perhaps, with the flush on her cheeks, the many stray hairs who'd escaped the tyranny of her ponytail. She lost the struggle to keep her eyes politely downcast before it began, drinking in the exquisite detail of the wizard's guests.First honour went to the host. She knelt and began to genuflect to her teacher. ""Master,"" she paused in her respectful greeting, realizing the Ghanish scroll was still in her left hand. She blinked, then stuffed it in her sleeve.After an awkward moment, Lyni apologized for her gaff by taking Mern's cup to be refilled. The smell of the powerful liquor hit her nostrils, and her brow furrowed in disapproval. Mern was wise, learned, dangerous, but still an old man. She barely filled half of his bowl.""Perhaps we could send for some clove tea?"" She asked Mern, perhaps too pointedly to be truly diffident. ""Your guests,"" she took this as an excuse to continue examining those reclining before him, ""might appreciate something gentler."" ",Recognize a Marrow Knight

They could reflect present circumstances, aristocrats who derived their authority by the estates they oversaw. Often, they were genealogical, referring to ancestral land lost during the Breaking. The rarest reflected plots owned in fallen Kerispur, borne by a handful of important families allied to the royal court.But 'owner of land'?Lyni wasn't short by any measure, and the sitting org was as tall as she was standing. His rumbling reply was more ice-water running down her back. A veiled threat?The Marrow Knight's approval of her greeting would have pleased her, had he not named himself a 'ghost-chaser'. Alone, the logical assumption would be he was talking about hunting an elusive quarry. Taken with the rest, however, it painted a disturbing picture.It was then she realized she'd been asked for her name twice. She reached for the first one that came to mind.""I am Blaženka."" As she replied, she remembered this was the obviously Ghanish name of a scholar who’d articulated a theory of alchemical origin for the Vargör.“Oh,” she said, demurely, “shit!”Epiphany washed over her, leaving calm in its wake. At that moment she knew, if she was very lucky and these visitors weren’t here to kill her, her time in the archives of Tung had come to an end. When the Church sought her outside of Kimmura, and it was only a matter of ‘when’, this would be among the first places they looked. A place of learning; the kind that comforted her, the kind that excited her. She needed to move on, and keep moving until she found somewhere to, or became someone who could, disappear.“My apologies,” she was smiling again, gently, “my name is , physiker.” She had been asked to explain the title many times, so the next part came naturally. “A healer of the sick and injured.” ",Roll

Women and men of Stonyford! As told you not only a fugitive have we brought in your village, but also news, inauspicious news, unfortunately.In our journey in search of we found a large gang of outlaws. Their camp is South, across the river, not far from the Gladden Field and when we arrived there they were making preparations to raid your lands and villages. As far as we know they have neither families nor scruples, their only desire is to loot your goods, to capture those of you who are worth to sell as slaves and to kill the others. Coming back we sank all the boats we had found on the bank. We did so to give to a little more time, time you should use to prepare yourselves for the imminent war. “He paused for a moment, letting that his words penetrate into their minds and hearts, then he continued:“Follow my advice: call the thains and summon a moot. Gather the herds and strengthen the palisade. Light to fire in the forges, whet your weapons and repair armours and shields so that you are ready when they come. Our fellow, Larsi son of Torg, the valorous dwarf of the Ered Luin people, has already gone on ahead to break the news to Beorn the Skinchanger, our wise leader. So, don’t be afraid, you’re not alone, still there is hope in the hearts of the men and strength in their arms.“ ",Awe (+1 bonus die)

To stay to protect the settlement, risking to lose all, things and lives, or to go North, leaving Stonyford to the mercy of a merciless gang of cutthroats?“However,” he thought, “what if Valter stroke all those helpless people while they were going North to find the protection of Beorn? It would be a disaster!”Thus, he cleared his throat and said to :“Better to stay and fight behind the protection of the palisade, if a fight has to be, than to risk to be ambushed while on the road. That’s my opinion. We should stay here and wait the return of Larsi, and of Beorn with him. Meanwhile we can strengthen our defences and send scouts to get an early warning of the coming of Valter and his thugs. As for your proposal, Jot,  I agree with you: somebody should warn the Woodmen of the danger. I’ll give you the hermite’s axe as well, so you can bring that heirloom back to the people whom it belongs to. ”(OOC: Battle to weigh up the different military options) ",Battle
Battle,">"" , I have said I will stand with you. You wish to stay with the villagers, so will I. Come, my friend, we have traps and plans to set up. I think that we could set up some tiny rafts upstream of the river: when we see the slaver's boats they can be set alight and pushed out into the river; even if they do  not hit the enemy, these floating fires will unsettle their approach, maybe slow them down and give us longer to shoot at them - with fire arrows too. Releasing floating fires can be a job for any bold lad: that should keep them away from the fighting as well.""will also roll Battle to look out for any approachs to the village that might give advantages.

Healer,">As quickly as it had begun – no, quicker, much quicker and more final – the skirmish with their elusive, persistent persecutor was over.The tunnels seemed to go quiet, with Carlasan's muted sobs mixing with the thrashing of the tormented sea just outside. Relative freedom, so close at hand. Bendane's hand sank slowly to his side, mid-cast, as he watched Lahra slump choking and dying to the rough ground, beyond his ability to minister to. He was not sure he could have mustered the good will to do so, even if Rawiya's shot was not so perfectly lethal. Some part of him wanted to sneer, to tell the dead woman and the survivor Wrecker that they picked the wrong crew, that this was the wages of their murderous trade, that they got what was coming to them. But he couldn't manage that, either.He looked up as Rawiya hobbled past her target, eyes widening. “Nine bloody hells. Did you roll in the hay with a dire porcupine?” This, he could deal with. A quick survey of the plainsfolk's wounds suggested their were messier than they were severe, but it still gave him plenty to attend to. A scattering of powdered rust monster extract would clear the wounds of any residual metal shards and ward off lockjaw, and there were ample bottles of booze to irrigate and disinfect them. To distract her from the stinging, he bantered: “What you said about ruthless, short-sighted egomania not being a religious calling? I don't know about that - sounds like every chaplain and prayer-slinger I've ever run across.” Feeling stern eyes on him, he glanced up at the scowling Nephthys. “Present company excluded,” he added nervously.He finished by tightly bandaging her left forearm and ribs, then turned to the puncture wound on her foot. “Ooof. Nasty. Best I can do is clean and bind it and strap a pad to your foot to distribute the weight.” He set about this, then sat back with a sigh. “That should hold you together. Boundless curiosity intact and a pinch of pixie dust for spice. Don't ask for a lollipop, though. I'm all out.” He called over to Shi'leiran: “Looks like you took a tumble as well. Anything I did for you would risk disrupting the last time I stitched you up, I'm afraid.”Bendane rested his shoulders against the wall, grimacing as he was reminded of his own lacerated back. “Well, fuck us. We're alive. Fuck those that aren't worse, I suppose.” He bowed his head in exhaustion, arms slack at his sides in the pile of debris. He felt his hand brush against something hard and angled, and wearily glanced out of the corner of his eye – then gave a grunt of relief as he saw the familiar, iron-bound cages of his spellbooks stacked amidst the flotsam.

Amdir Search,">The party can drive the wagon a fair bit closer to the encampment, almost to the line of the trees. As he has offered already, stands guard over the Orc-Man and the wagon. Skirfira's Raven might elect to stay with him as an extra pair of eyes. This pleases the big man.Zaken is keen to step down and look for any things of interest in the camp. Moving through the trees - which look stunted and tired with few leaves of their branches - he leads the approach to the camp with Fletch by his side. Amdir will follow behind with the others, bow strung and arrow nocked, scanning the sides of the barely visible trail leading into the bespoilt area. It has a foul feel and a grimy look to the campsite.There are small piles of discarded rubbish; a few bones sticking out of a charred circle of ashes near the middle. A discarded big pot, ideal for stews. Three large pieces of brown cloth have been stretched between two close tree trunks, making some sort of wind break. Dug out of the ground itself are several shallow trenches; lined with straw or grass, and with bedrolls on top. Clearly these are quick and lazy sleeping shelters with a wind break behind. In front of them, lie two further, quite narrow,  trenches about 18 inches deep: these face each other and make two seating areas, each like a low down bench. The ground between the two trenches was used as a table in this manner explains Fletch. In the bottom of these trenches are the spilt debris of a few meals. Not far away there is a barrel, empty of beer, (but it was refilled with water yesterday). Fletch moves over to a specific bed-trench. He riffles through the covering that is on top of the straw, and extracts his belongings: his pipe; a change of top that might be called a shirt; a cap made of leather; his small whetstone; and his prized fletching rig. He looks at a bottle, drains the last of its contents, and drops it. A lean-to of branches is the largest temporary dwelling. Probably room for four in there, except that Fletch says that this is where the leader, , stayed. Inside this place there are some (3) roughly sawed log-rings that might serve as seats; and a pile of squashed bracken material long enough to doss on. From the overlapping branches that are pulled together into the primitive roof, two ropes are hanging. One holds a bag covered in flies, and beginning to stink of something going 'off'. Something stopped dripping out of this bag a while ago, as the stain under it appears quite dry. Blood perhaps?The other bag is stuffed with some rags and one or two tools, including a knife. The rags are in a bundle and may be spoil from victims.On the floor, partly covered in the bedding, is a box of some wood, tied around with leather (probably) straps.  Stuffed into the 'walls' of this bivouac; and acting as very rough shelves; there are some older bottles and a container like a mug or cup. There are two leather (probably) pouches also packed into the 'walls'. When inspected, one of these is almost half full with - pipeweed! - but no-one wants to take it!A club rests next to the bed: it has a stone carved head with a hammer on one side and a point on the other. The point is also stained a dark brown colour. Next to that is a rolled up canvas - very like to a map. That should interest Skirfira the scholar..Zaken is glad he has his gloves on. Amdir will poke around using the tip of his arrow. He will lift things, a little half-heartedly, not enjoying the prospect of finding what these bandits would want to keep nor what they would finally choose to throw away either! ",Amdir Search
Wisdom,">In the meantime Amdir has approached the hanging bag (the other one, NOT the rotting meat larder). He puts some gloves on. woven of a material similar to his grey cloak, they do not restrict the nimble movements of his fingers.He examines the rags and the knife.  The knife is black with a black design on the hilt. It reeks of evil; it seems to his Elven senses that the knife carries anger. With a dull slowness, he recalls the size of that scabbard still in the wagon. They would fit each other.  A dark noise from inside his head: a will to connect the two. An impatient will that wants to see this knife in that scabbard. His elven brooch chooses that moment to reflect some sunshine from above his head - onto the knife. The voice is cut off: he wraps the blade in the same rags. No. He will say nothing of this to the others. He will take all the risk of the knowledge of the blade on himself. It must stay separate from the whispering scabbard.  ",Wisdom

It may blow sand and dust sometimes, but the deposits are being thinned, trees are in leaf ( a most welcome sight anywhere to any elf) and there is the frequent trickle of water or reflection off a clear pool as they pass. The animals have no difficulty getting water or grass as they plod along. In a conversation  with Zaken on the journey he communicates the idea that he has retained something ominous from that campsite. He also learns of what Zaken experienced at the moment he cast the box into the flames. Neither want to discuss the shadow, nor the sneer from . Somehow he had worked his gag free: now it is regularly checked by the elf. The orc does not seem to relish being touched by Amdir, and glares at him at these times. The elf responds with a smile - that is not a smile - and conceals the fact that the orc thing is repugnant and abhorrent to him.  It would be good to hand this thing over to Thorin Stonehelm for justice: but if the Dwarf Prince does not feel it part of his jurisdiction then they have will have to  escort it all the way back to Dale where King Bard can judge the thing's banditry crimes.The two companions notice that Fletch has gone very quiet and withdrawn.

As her interviews with the squadron pilots confirmed, there are times when accepted doctrine is not the most effective tactical choice. While the thresholds for such divergences are still the result of input parameters, the neural net she has developed allows for far greater flexibility than a simple If-X-then-Y decision tree like the Vulture architecture.In essence, she has attempted to program a veteran pilot's instinct into her droid platform. And one of the hallmarks of almost every veteran pilot she has interviewed is pride.

There would've been some kind of public record of the case, though for all he knows that names will be stricken from the public records. But if they can figure out when she was forced out, they can probably find the right record... OOC Computer skills check below. (Rolled a 3!) ",Roll

If the records are accessible, he'll search the log for records of Ms. Peale's license plates. If the vehicle is still there, he'll call Jae (who is presumably en route to the hospital) and suggest he take a few minutes to search the lot in question and maybe puncture the tires, to prevent Ms. Peale making an easy getaway. After that, he'll also run a scan of the records for female children brought into the hospital during the timeframe in question, and see if Regina's still at the hospital. He's got more planned, but it depends on whether they're still on the premises or have already left. I guess that's a Computer Use roll: 29, a ""Good Success""]]] ",Roll
Roll,">So, Nathan was trying to call Jae to let him know that there's no record of the rental car ever stopping at the hospital. I'm guessing he'd text, and if he didn't get a response in a few hours, he'd get concerned, maybe assuming the worst. He also pays close attention to whether a message received checkmark appears by his messages after sending them. He starts by sending a message to the group:Message:Has anyone heard from Jae lately? He went to check out the hospital that Ms. Peale supposedly asked about at the tollbooth, but I, uh, secured information to the effect that Peale and Regina never went there. I was trying to contact Jae to alert him, but he's not picking up *or* responding to texts. And it's been a few hours now, which seems like a long time—I'm concerned he may have run into the suspect outside the hospital and... well, who knows what could have happened. According to my phone's messaging software, he [is/is not] receiving the messages. I don't know what's up. Is anyone in the area, who could drive over to the hospital and see if he's there? I'm sending a map showing the likeliest route from the tollbooth to the hospital, in case someone's closer and can check it out?Then Nathan sits in awkward, disturbed silence, and starts digging for the following in the city's digital records database for the license plates (and make & model) of Jae's car. He figures he might as well run a search on the local law enforcement database for anything in the last 24 hours, even if it's flagged in the daily downloads of speed camera logs or something. Note: made a Computer Skill roll of 53 (basic success) if it's needed.

Then he takes up his fiddle and begins to play a jaunty melody. ""When your road has gotten rough and you've had more than enoughof the troubles overfraught and fought in vainJust take a moment to consider you can still enjoy your dinnerInstead of being dinner to some nut-brain""The melody is like a balm permeating the joints and muscles of the group as they take the time to lick their wounds (the tabaxi doing so quite literally). During the break, he takes out the small chest he found in the wardrobe and examines it closer for a lock and any sign of a trap.

Sorry for the bonds. We had to be sure you were in your right mind. Short story (and you know I'm not one for those): I happened upon these fine folk and we tracked you back to some weird alien craft that was attacked by a white dragon.  We bested the crew, made a new friend,"" he gestures to Krath, ""nearly shoved a tadpole in my nose and possibly committed infanticide.

Plot a Course vs 13,">From the bridge, ‘Erad went directly to the shuttle bay. He made no stops, detoured only to collect a tricorder, and did not linger en route. Commander Xad’s order was to meet in 30 minutes, and by the time anyone else arrived they would find that the helm officer had long ago reported for duty, and was hard at work on his pre-flight checks. When at last the away team was assembled, Lato’Erad was confident in the efficiency of the Helmholtz’s impulse manifolds, secure in the accuracy of the flight computer, and pleased with the hum of the engines as they vibrated the deck plating.With everyone else already aboard as he finished a final round of spot checks, the tall and broad-shouldered junior officer gently pushed past Xad, Wang, , L’Eni, and Nostrun to take the conn. He rumbled a gravelly but sincere “Pardon me,” as he went.The controls beep, beep, beepbeep, beep’d as he tapped at them, adjusting his assumed heading not just with regard to the subspace interference, but to stay well away from the hazardous zones generated by operation of a starship’s warp coils, and even to account for localized gravitic topography.It is impossible to ignore the smile on his face, a crack shooting through his stony appearance. “Course laid in. It appears to be a comfortable flight.”Half turning in his seat to look back at the team, the smile still prominent on his face, ‘Erad offered up: “Should have us aboard the Alcubierre shortly.”Then, with practiced ease and grace that is perhaps surprising given its source, he  settles his hands on the helm and the shuttle rises gently into the air.

Fear,">Miguel hated cryo. It was just one of those things that got under his skin, along with corporate assholes and cockroaches. Unfortunate that he was most likely surrounded by all three. He closed his eyes after he settled into the pod, waiting as the techs worked to get him hooked up, trying to send his mind away, settle into the zone, fall into the ease he felt with a ship’s controls under his hands. But this was not that – not by a longshot. In the pilot’s chair he was in control, and here it was the opposite. If something happened in space when he was flying, a blown conduit or system failure, he at least had a chance to change his fate. Here, in the cryopod, there was no changing his fate, no agency whatsoever. If something happened mid-trip and the life support failed, then that was that. He would never wake up.His breathing was getting faster, not slower, his body tensing in the cold gel. He could hear his own heartbeat, pitched like the thrum of an engine.Too-fast, too-fast, he told himself. Slow it down. It made no logical sense to fear this; it should be the opposite. Having absolutely no control absolved him of any responsibility for things going wrong. It would be one thing, wouldn’t it, if he tried to fix things and failed, and people died because he wasn’t good enough. This had nothing to do with him. It shouldn’t have been frightening.That was the problem with fear, though. It was illogical. It would not listen no matter how he tried to reason with it. It would not leave him alone. The only thing for it would be for the techs to finally push the button. Meanwhile time crawled.Miguel gritted his teeth, waiting to fall asleep. ",Fear

She leans imperceptibly towards Sam, a little shocked.Fingertip smudging the graphite into deeper shadows around the edges.""Dad? He's-- yeah, he's as good as he'll ever be again."" It would sound bitter, but Cassie is barely paying attention to her words, spooling them out just so Sam doesn't take her hand away. ""My brother is an idiot, though. I just keep thinking about him-- instead of Byron.""She's crossed some invisible line now with the drawing. Her hand keeps moving, but Cassie can't bear to look down at what is coming out on her paper. She should have stopped. Torn it out. Balled it up Burnt it.""And about what happened.""Hard, jagged lines that make her hand cramp from squeezing the pencil.Sam's eyes are brown, Cassie realizes, but if she drew them in color, they would be amber, like some sort of animal. ""S-some of us are going to cut after fourth. To explore the park, if you wanted..."" Cassie leans forward a breath further until--Sam's eyes drop to the page and Cassie's gaze follows without meaning to. Her hand has stopped drawing. ",Gaze into the Abyss
Turn Someone On,">Cassie comes out of her vision, chest heaving from the hunt, lips just parted. The knife fills her with dread, even in two-dimensions, but it also radiates the sort of power that makes her ache somewhere deep inside. Even the Blinded God's wordless demand just confirms its awful importance. It drowns out the shock she should have felt after witnessing a murder.Her face burns and her palms itch and some small part of her realizes that this isn't her, that this desire is from the voice in her head.But it feels good.Turning to Sam, Cassie quirks her lips into a teasing smile. ""You don't look so easy to terrify, Sam. But thanks, it... just sort of came to me."" She brushes her own hand over the picture, intersecting the path of Sam's fingers as the other girl traces the drawing, meeting her gaze when their hands touch. Her smile is sly, ""Maybe we should try to find out what it is."" ",Turn Someone On
Shut down,">Sam feels the tension she’s got roiled you right now boil over into anger, eager for release.She stands up and turns to a Jessica, walking forward to stand face to face with her.“Jessica, you need to back off... now. We know you’re upset... but she didn’t mean anything by it. How could she know you were gonna see it and freak out? She was just drawing some stupid thing from some fucking nerd shit I couldn't get her to stop talking about? Calm down and don’t talk about her brother or dad like that, ok? You need a punching bag?... then go to the gym...” She says, trying to be calm... and taking deep breaths... her hands clenching and unclenching with the itch for movement.Cassie can see it... how much Sam craves to just smack this girl... how violence is the language she knows best.The beast she’s trying to keep reigned in that just understands it’s scared and confused and angry and wants to lash out...How hard she’s holding herself back from it... trying to not give in.She hears... scary and savage snarling as Sam speaks... canine, it sounds like? ",Shut down
Turn Someone On,">""It's not like--"" Cassie starts, but then Sam grabs her hand and she's left blushing as she trails after the other girl.""A wolf?"" Cassie asks as they fall into step. Her eyes flicker to where Sam's hand hangs at her side, wondering if the other girl had meant anything by it. ""Like, you run around in the forest and howl at the moon? But--"" the incredulity dies on Cassie's lip and she looks at the other girl again. ""You're serious? Like a werewolf or something? And... you've been looking out for me?""Once again, Sam's blunt compassion sends Cassie's emotions off the rails. It's been months since anyone has said that to her, besides the occasional teacher who actually meant that they were worried about her future. The stab of vulnerability frightens Cassie, but part of her has been craving security--""Maybe I am. In trouble, I mean. I don't know, I've just been feeling alone."" They walk in silence for a few minutes before she adds, ""Thank you.""Sam's pout pulls Cassie out of her reverie, and she surprises herself by reaching over and snatching Sam's hand back from her crossed arms. ""Hey, fuck Jessica, alright? She wouldn't know what to do with herself if it wasn't for all this attention. Did you hear her, I was already getting looks. She would have taken it all out on me if you weren't there."" ",Turn Someone On
shut down,">Sam's eyes widen as she flushes, and feels Cassie take her hand and hold it.. it was meaningful.. different than her perfunctory let's get the hell out of her one from a minute ago..Her heart begins to pound again but for different reasons than before.Cassie was... sweet... and innocent... earnest.And warm and soft... and kind of cute... Sam also thinks.She clears her throat and tries to not make it seem like it's a thing... that she's completely still confident and nonchalant right now, even as she feels cracks opening in her walls.Alone...That's what really gets her if she's honest. She has felt that way for so long, way before what happened... it's hard to remember not feeling itShe feels herself yearning so badly. SO badly... to connect. To trust.To open up and trust Cassie.But that would be completely stupid.... she can't possibly.I mean it figures... So far she wants to bang the shady vampire girl who she's pretty sure is supposed to be her mortal enemy or something... and also probably just wants to drink her blood, which is not a kink of hers.And then she's kind of actually... possibly really into Cassie... who's being taken over... used... invaded... by this...seriously scary... evil... thing.She has to help her... but she can't actually care too much, because she knows that just gets you hurt... or them hurt.Cassie deserved better than her anyway.""Jessica doesn't really matter. You are in trouble... and I'm going to help you. We'll figure this out, Cassie... but I'm not tame... you need to be careful around me. I'm dangerous on my best day... and I'm kind of really stressed right now..."" Sam gruffs out, her tone brusk and warning as she shakes off Cassie's hand, and keeps walking ahead with purpose, leaving Cassie scrambling to catch up.Even though it's the complete opposite of what she wants to do... which is just hug her and tell her how she's felt alone too... and how she will try her best to save her...She knows she's exaggerating a little with Cassie to push her away... She's not that loose a cannon... and she's generally pretty safe unless you seriously piss her off or attack her.She's been working really hard on that... all that stupid meditation stuff has been actually helping.But Cassie doesn't know that, so it's a good enough excuse.""Tell me about who's going to check out the woods? You said you're supposed to sneak out at 5th period or something? Who's going with you?"" She asks, businesslike now as she tries to concentrate and they finally reach under the bleachers.Fuck emotions... She was going to get shit DONE. ",shut down
Gaze into the Abyss,">""A scavenger hunt?"" Levi asks. He furrows his brow. Scavenger hunt... did somebody say something about that? He doesn't run in the same circles as Justin or - any of the popular kids, really. But maybe if he thinks about it...Levi focuses on spreading the samples on the sheet. The quiet scratching sound of the heated salt crystals. If he focuses on that, blocks out the chatter and gossip at the tables around them. The sounds of the students doing everything except what they're supposed to. Maybe he'll remember? ",Gaze into the Abyss
Hypnotic,">Helene watches what happens to Levi with alarm. She can tell that something's deeply wrong, but has no idea what triggered it.She knows what a panic attack looks like. She used to get them, once upon a time, when her life was very different. But she never really knew how to get through them herself gracefully, and she has no idea how to help someone through them.Maybe if she was a few years older, maybe if she'd had better help herself, she'd have the tools to safely, responsibly help him through this. Well, she doesn't. But she does have one very powerful tool. And right now, with the metaphorical hammer she's holding, Levi looks an awful lot like a nail.She leans close, and looks deep into his eyes. And she does the thing, the thing with her eyes that makes people listen to her, makes people do what she says. ""Levi. You're safe. I promise. Calm down.""  ",Hypnotic
Turn On,">""Yeah, I do,"" Helene says. She's stopped writing around the words 'heard something behind me,' but now she goes back to it, giving Levi space for whatever he needs. ""That really sucks."" She fills out the last field on the worksheet, and caps her pen. She's still for a moment. Then she turns quickly wraps her arms tight around Levi. ""I'm glad you're ok. Let me know if you ever need anything, ok? Anything."" Levi feels a surprising need in how tightly and closely she holds him, and an unexpected affection in her voice. Why the aloof new girl is opening up to him isn't immediately clear, but it's happening. He also can't help but be aware of her breasts against his chest and the smell of lavender in her hair.She lets him go as abruptly as she hugged him and grabs his filled-in worksheet. She favors him with a slight smile, but beyond that, the mask she wears around the school is back in place. ""I'll pass these in."" ",Turn On
Shut down,">Helene freezes in place from where she's standing near the lab table with the filled-in worksheets. She smiles robotically and walks up to the desk, dropping them in front of Mr. Strassmore.""This was way too easy and you knew it,"" she says quietly, gesturing at the handouts. Her smile never wavers; the class can tell she's speaking, but not necessarily hear her. ""But you gave it out anyway because you're a mediocre teacher. And you know that too. Sorry for hugging my friend.""She returns to the desk and grabs her purse and backpack, favoring Levi with a quick smile as she gathers her things.   ",Shut down
Keep Your Cool,">Levi feels the buzz of the phone in his pocket. Checking to make sure Mr. Strasmoore is distracted by ensuring Helene gets out of class, he slides it out and checks it, reading the text from Cassie. He purses his lips. It's a little early. He'll have to explain to his dad later why he wasn't in class. But he's got to get out of here, away from the eyes and the staring.When the bell rings, Levi gets his bag and slips out into the hall, quietly making his way through the throng toward the front door of the school. If this goes well, just slip out and keep walking. Don't look back. He pushes through the front door of the school. ",Keep Your Cool

Two handed axe,">Being on his knees, his adversary was a threat to and his companions no more, so hit him with the haft of his axe making the man unconscious. “There is no need to taint the great river’s waters with your blood, boy”, he whispered to the sleeping man, “Maybe, when all is ended, you might want to amend your many mistakes, who knows?” But he had no time to linger, so he swiftly picked up his throwing axes and ran towards the place where was fighting against the archers. Mighty were his arms in the battle, but no man could stand up to him in running and swiftness. So it was that he reached his friend in few minutes, cutting through the melee as cool breeze through a grove.Standing shoulder to shoulder with , took up his long hafted axe with two hands and letting out his battle cry he slashed at one of the archers. “For and Stonyford!!”(OOC: Forward stance, if there were more than one adversary I would try the swift strike called shot.

Someone must assist.There are still two? or maybe three?  other archers off to the side. They are peppering the village side of the river: even though  's and 's  charge has removed some pressure from this attack, the villagers are being driven to shelter and their return fire is diminishing. So, the villagers are taking cover, they should hold out for a bit longer: but if Valter wins his fight, there will be a breakthrough. And if Valter is bested, those archers will run anyway.So their choice is clear, they must attack Valter directly before their friends are overcome, as he runs back across the water will call out his support and attempt to raise the morale of the injured men (Rally Comrades option i.e.  open stance ) with a battlecry""DALE!

Culture,">Someone attacked a temple of the Priest Kings? Sarah thought to herself when the topic died down. Who would be stupid enough to do that? Not even agents of the Kur attack so openly. Something strange must have happened...Sarah had no love for the Priest Kings. She thought them real enough; she had seen Kur before, even touched one, and divine beings did not wage war on physical ones. She had spoken to those who claimed to know what they were from books that had been written and published on Earth before she was born, who said they were giant insects with technology so advanced it might as well have been magic. Sarah did not necessarily believe them, but then, Sarah did not think that it mattered all that much what they were. They were real, and had seen fit to keep Gor in the cultural Iron Age which had done her little good and plenty of harm. No, Sarah did not believe in their mysticism or holiness. And neither did Elisha given that she had noticed none of the signs of obeisance she had come to expect every time the Priest Kings came up. That was odd...""Tell me, captor? If I had not begged last night, would my treatment at your hands been any different?""Elisha's question jolted Sarah out of one musing, and into another...""You were brooding last night, Say-rah,"" Atiya said as she scrubbed Sarah's back in the cool mountain river. The statement caused the First Spear to glance back over her shoulder, meet her sister in the eyes. ""...how did you know?"" she asked, not denying the fact.""You did not hush our captive,"" Atiya replied. ""You do not do that unless you are thinking or deep in sleep, and this stony ground is not the soft grasses of the forest."" After a moment of quiet, she asked, ""What troubles you?""Sarah sighed, slow and heavy. How can I even begin to talk about this? Yet Atiya was her Second Spear, her most trusted girl, her sister. She would not lie to her.""Her weeping reminded me...of me."" The water swirled about them as Sarah turned to face her sister. ""I wept like that, often, in the dead of night. Do mistake me, I fought back against my slavery, hard, and carry the scars from that rebellion even now. I did what I had to, said what I had to in order to survive, and not once did I submit willingly or abandon my plans to escape...but that doesn't mean that...""Atiya's arms gently rose up and rested on Sarah's shoulders, her hands cradling the back of her head. ""Say-rah,"" she whispered, eyes filled with empathic pain, ""you know that I didn't mean-""Sarah stopped her, held her fingers to the girl's lips. ""I know. You don't have to apologize, though I thank you for it. But that isn't it. It's that feeling, that knowing that you'll never see your family, your loved ones again. It weighs on you.""Atiya nodded, her own eyes starting to glisten. She understood. Yet even still she was reassuring. ""You have not lost your family. Your sisters are with you, I am with you, always. Your daughter is beautiful, and strong like her mother. Your man visits the trading points regularly.""""And I am thankful for all of that, I truly am,"" Sarah said, holding her sister close. ""I just remember being that girl, lost, alone, afraid, trapped, when all I could think about was my mother and father, how I would never see them again, how desperately I wanted to go home. She's still somewhere, deep inside me, and last night she came out again...""Sarah wanted to say more, about how if she could she would like to live in a world where children weren't taken from their parents, but the words did not even begin to form before she choked on them. It was a useless conversation, and one she wouldn't risk having now. To weep over the pain that Gor had caused was one thing but to suggest that slavery, the trade that helped them live their lives, was wrong? That was too much, and even distraught she would not say what could be confused for weakness.Fortunately Atiya did not press further, and merely held her First Spear in silence. ""That girl was strong, for enduring what she did and not breaking,"" she finally offered, pulling away far enough to let their noses touch. ""She brought you to the forests, where you belong. Your parents would be proud.""Sarah smiled, for even though she was not convinced it was what she felt she needed to hear. ""I am sorry. I am only human, and my life on Gor has been a turbulent one. I will try not to inconvenience you with my emotions.""""I am not inconvenienced,"" Atiya said, rubbing her nose to Sarah's. ""And the only thing you need to apologize for is not scrubbing my back as hard as I have scrubbed yours!""At that Atiya slapped Sarah on the bottom, causing the First Spear to yelp. And together they began to play.Thinking about her conversation with Atiya this morning, Sarah considered Elisha's question. ""Possibly,"" she said with a shrug. ""You would not have escaped the beating with the switch and stick, as my sisters and I can be vicious to free women. But they would have tired quicker, and grown bored if you had not begged. Perhaps you would have even earned our respect, as though we do not believe in what you believe about how women must act and dress a refusal to abandon that belief is evidence of strength. Perhaps that would have meant a warmer blanket or more than just bones and gristle, but who can say? We are past that now, and you are at our mercy.""Approaching the town, several women came out to greet them. Sarah would have expected it to be men who would do that, but hill women were tougher than most and Sarah and Elisha appeared to be one of them. The only weapon visible between the two was Sarah's short bow, which would not be out of the ordinary for two women travelling alone. ""Tal,"" Sarah answered. ""I am Adira, and this is Elisha, both of the Pamiri tribe. We are returning home from pilgrimage to the Sardar mountains, in accordance to the wishes of the Initiates.""Sarah then made the signs of obeisance that she expected to be customary when mentioning the White Caste.

Shut Someone Down,">Home. Out. It's my dad. My brother. I--Cassie turns slowly, her mind racing: she only has one chance to get the right lie, or she'll have to run for it-- and she's not particularly interested in having a chat with Principal Savage tomorrow. ""Oh. Dr. Greene, hi! I was just--"" The door behind Dr. Greene cracks open and then shut again, interrupting Cassie. Her gaze flicks to the door, and then back to Dr. Greene, first meeting the older woman's eyes and then taking in her hair and the unbuttoned blouse. ""What are you doing here, Dr. Greene? This isn't the English hall. Don't teachers usually eat lunch in their office or the staff lounge?"" ",Shut Someone Down
Turn Someone On,">This is new. Cassie keeps her face impassive as Rene's fingers brush against her hand.She had spent most of sophomore year crushing on Ricky-- the sort of strangled, wide-eyed affection that read as overly enthusiastic friendship. Then there was the accident and nothing mattered... and then Sam showed up this year, and everything mattered.After this morning, and maybe nothing matters again. But... Cassie hadn't thought about either of the twins like that in months-- and never about Rene. But the other girl wasn't exactly being subtle, and if nothing else, crushing on Sam had given Cassie permission to notice girls. With a furtive glance at Ricky, Cassie lets her fingers tangle with Rene's for a second, barely pulling her towards the back seat with her. ""What's that song, Rene? I think I recognize it..."" She teases. ",Turn Someone On

Persuasion,">Once arrived in Edoras, having greeted the guards who already knew him, went directly to the King’s stables where he took his horse and Othar’s one and then he stood there for a while taking care of them and of the others horses. He was very fond of those animals and he often thought them as more trustworthy than humans: their big bright eyes housed indeed, he was used to thinking, neither grains of deception nor trace of falsehood. Having cleaned and curried them, took care of himself washing his face and hands and changing his travel clothes for garments which fit better the court of a King.He wore black trousers under a black coat with white pluff sleeves and a silver tree embroidered on the breast. A grey cloak with the emblems of the Stewards of Gondor and the green horse of Rohan in white field covered his shoulder.He went into the inn where he knew he would have met Othar and his new and old companions. He stopped on the threshold looking around in the crowded place to see where his friends were. He spotted who were talking with an exceptionally handsome woman. Then he recognized Othar and the others around her, thus he stepped slowly into the room towards the group. He were taking his time to look at the new entry of the group: something in her clothes and manners told him about something exotic, indubitably stranger, but he recognized in her something strangely familiar which, however, he could not find a name for. There was an aura of joy and beauty around her, and a uncanny light in her eyes which he was awed by.Having come close enough to catch the words of the conversation that was going on, he heard talking about “...convincing teenagers to court.” and he saw all them toasting to love.Having reached the group he waited for an opportunity to chime in, then he presented himself to the stranger lady, bowing slightly:“Hail, my fair Lady, I had to reconsider the Inns of Edoras: I knew them for the deliciousness of the beers they offers and for the virtuosity of the minstrels they have as guests, but I never heard that such flowers grow up in their rooms!” He said smiling, then added courteously:“ I’m Herion's son, scout of the Stewards of Gondor, tender of Thengel’s stables, part of the Troll slayers company, at your service. May I be so bold as to inquire your name? ”Then, when he rose again and made eye contact with her,  a few verses came up to his lips as if they were coming from a fairy, distant land so that he could not help singing softly:“Her hair was long, her limbs were white,And fair she was and free;And in the wind she went as lightAs leaf of linden-tree.” ",Courtesy

What the hell is wrong with the robot?!"" he blurted, before catching himself.  David knew he shouldn't lose his cool in front of the staff.  They would look to him for steadiness and leadership during this operation.  It was just that he felt so damned awful...

And tell me anything you know about Hitchhiker.""She wrote a quick script, repurposing an old school attack bypass to spoof the right key against her name.

Perception,"> Heather approaches the address that Shannon had given her on foot. She had taken a cab to get way within walking distance. Not wanting the driver to know where she was going, she had decided to go the last few streets on foot. A decision she did not regret as it gave her time to clear her mind and mentally prepare for the gathering. She didn’t like big gatherings like these. Even though Shannon had taught her how to behave amongst other kindred, she was still anxious about the possibility of making a mistake that could cost her a lot. Because of that, Heather preferred to avoid Kindred gatherings when she could. However, today, she didn’t have a choice. Not just her Sire had made it clear that Heather couldn’t avoid tonight’s meeting; the Prince himself had insisted on her coming. The knowledge that she had been summoned here by the highest authority in the city only fed into her anxiety. Arriving at the address she had been given, Heather brushed a few strands of hair out of her face before stepping in. As the ghoul asked for her jacket, Heather just nodded quietly and handed it over. She then quickly straightened her blouse underneath – indubitably the single most expensive piece of clothing, she owned – and made sure her black dress pants were clean, too. Finally, she inspected her hairdo in the reflection in the glass pane of the front door. Caring about her appearance like this wasn’t typical for her, not even in the slightest. However, she had been taught the importance of keeping up appearances when interacting with other Kindred. And even though she didn’t like to pretend, she wanted to be taken as serious as her age would allow. Satisfied with her appearance, She stepped into the main area of the museum. She politely refused the nourishment offered to her – she had just fed last night and pitied the poor souls, who were being offered up like appetizers. Quickly, she stepped away from the entrance area and took a good look around the room to see if she could spot any familiar faces in the crowd. ",perception

His unamused look turns into a cruel sneer as he hears a voice ask him whether he wants to feed his newly formed, existence sustaining habit with the blood of someone else. Even as he turns around to face the servant asking, his words are already coming out in a snarl. ""What kind of schmuck doesn't eat up before a big meet?

He mutters to himself: ""It's only a matter of time before that pain in the ass starts doing his usual ""Unholier than thou"" schtick.

Only Faerie could give him the power he needed to deal with the dangerous world he had to live in now. Strangely enough, that put him on the same page as his sister, who was always drawn to power, but in a way she couldn't manage. He was much less weaker than her. He hoped at least...His mother had warned him of the perils of the Faerie Court. Other charms of Faerie could be tasted from outside that setting, and some power could be eked out with skill and patience. But for absolute and quick access to power, he would have to contend with the Court. Something his mother advised against, even with all the advice he might get from her. Even with all her knowledge and experience of it, she would not return.  ",Roll
Roll,">Warning tales that struck true kept him from pursuing this course til now...Not the prospect of missing time, of one's loved ones being old when you return; but of a painful death. It would seem that the true Fae play for keeps. Win or die in their game. Not like the fairy tales of other people's childhoods, but certainly of his. For whatever else would happen, they were just slow torturous preludes to a final death. Which always seemed like a bad thing to . Bad enough to keep him away, until now. Even now though he has his doubts, he could still turn back. But one more step where he can entertain the notion of going back to his normal life, and then he's through... ",Roll
Roll,">He recalls how he ended up here. Finally ignoring the warnings to pursue this course...His long-time girlfriend Darcy had been claimed by a Fae Prince, a promise gone awry or something and she was bound to him for an eternity. Something only a royal decree or some kind of princely status on his part could overcome. Not even murdering him would free her. So, there's that. Something worth risking dying over. Because living with it wasn't an option.  ",Roll
Roll,">And a tool that'll help him unlock it all? It seemed clear and obvious enough back in the real world, a picture of his mother, a Queen Consort of Faerie, and his half-brother, a Prince. Surely enough to claim some part of that power.But now, having stepped across into this realm, it hardly seems enough to get his foot in the door...The land will surely remember them, and that must be worth something. Unless they are out of favour, in which case he's probably signed his own death warrant...but once he's here he understands that the power should be within him, all he has to do it is walk barefoot, and drink spring water, and eat a fruit that he has plucked himself. So goes the tales at least... ",Roll
Roll,">The weather has turned foul as he makes his way through the forest. A dismal misty rain that has him soaked to his skin even as he convinces himself it's not too heavy. He spots a shelter, a fire, and a figure sipping a warm beverage...a completely alien figure. They look like a bizarre mixture of tree trunk, goat and human. The outcroppings on theirskin must be random, but there's a pattern to it, swirls and furls that draw the eye in. They smell like petrichor, that vibrant powerful smell of the ground after rain. It's comforting and aggressive at the same time. The sounds coming from them as they sips the drink are strange as well. Chirping and humming, punctuated by the odd snort. Faun from Pan's Labyrinth ",Roll
Roll,">The sound of their breath puts at ease somehow...it's a moment before he realises what it reminds him of, a horse's breathing, slow and steady but powerful. It reminds him of those trips they all used to take upstate before everything went to hell. It feels like family, being safe.Although, from what he knows now, all that was just an illusion. They were never safe, and his parents were never who he thought they were... ",Roll
Roll,">Something else concerns him though...the way they look at him. It chills his blood more than their alien appearance. It reminds him of the way his father looked at them - not that he thought it was strange at the time, only in retrospect. Like they were all pawns for his grand ambitions. Tools for his schemes. At least they're not looking at him like he's supper!But it's not like he has much choice. He needs a guide and this is it...unless he wants to be lost in this forest forever. ",Roll

They never lie. They never tell the whole truth. When he takes his seat by the fire he takes the offered drink with a little shaky hesitancy, remembering what his sister warned him of accepting hospitality. That was at Court though, and this is just a warm drink by the fire. Except at summer camp, it doesn't mean anything more than that!As he sips, he remembers a cherished childhood memory. Sitting on his mother's lap on the back porch of the holiday home Upstate. Drinking hot chocolate, swirling with melting marshmallows, slowly disintegrating in the heat. She puts an arm around him, kissing the top of his head. He squirms a little, perhaps a little embarrassed at the attention - though there's no one there. And eager to slurp the marshmallows before they disappear. She ruffles his hair and lets him go, with a smile and a soft word.She wasn't always like that. Sometimes she could be an ice queen, but when they were alone, she usually mellowed. Away from his dad, and sister, there was little at stake to maintain the pretense. ",Roll

",Roll
Roll,">After what seems like forever, they ask for what he offers in exchange for their help...He's thought about that, quite a lot, and some form of tribute seems to be the best thing he can offer. Not a once-off thing that could be taken and then leave him high and dry - though he knows that's a very human way of thinking about it.He offers a yearly offering. A back-to-basics traditional offering.""I offer a loaf of bread, and cream and butter enough for it. Every Spring solstice"" ",Roll
Roll,">He reaches into his jacket pocket, bringing out a loaf of soda bread, handing it over to them, waiting...They take it, sniffing at it, appreciating the warm and hearty smell of it, but noticing that there is no cream or butter with it. They harumph, a guttural noise that reminds or a horse who's not happy with its lot. They nod, accepting the arrangement. Raising Taboo to 1. ",Roll
Roll,">The Host tells a story of someone who wandered here and is still here as part of a bargain. From their description of a gormless young nerd, recognises that it must be Eddy, his mathlete college friend who went missing last year.Everyone assumed that the pressure had gotten to him, maybe his drive to excel had been too much. Some said he dropped out, others that he'd gotten involved in some kind of high stakes get-rich scheme where his genius-level math would be of some use. But had noticed a few things, neither of those stories fitted, and suspected he'd gotten caught up in something supernatural - enough had filtered through from those chaotic days in high school so that Eddy knew what was up. Strange too, that no one had really come looking for him, which made most believe he'd just dropped out and gone home. He's stuck no counting grains of the harvest, a monumental task obviously, and one struggles to think of how Eddy could end up making, but what can he do?He can hardly ask what Eddy got in return, or if he could help? No better to just keep on your own quest...""Well, may your harvest next year be fruitful!""He says, realising that he doesn't have a drink to raise in a toast, so a smile will have to do. Their head turns in a curious manner, with a smile that looks quite hungry and then they nod in return whispering in a strange language like a prayer to the wind.  ",Roll
Roll,">They ask why thinks it was their Door he found? isn't sure, at least not explicitly. His half-brother and mother had over the years hinted at several doors, but were never clear about where they would lead, or in fact that they all didn't lead to the same Realm. His research only showed a vague understanding of the cosmology, or the differences between Realms. They definitely didn't suggest that a Door could be someone's. But he chose their Door because it was ostensibly open, and not hidden underneath a pool, or waterfall, or behind a closed door. It seemed easier, and safer to get in and out of. Which seems like so much naivete now.""It seems more welcoming than the others I knew about? But truth be told, I don't know enough to have made the choice properly. Maybe my mother steered me in this direction?"" ",Roll

Roll,">In return he offers them a welcome hearth to visit. Even as he assumes that they will be able to glamour their appearance in his world, wonders if this is an acceptable offer. But hospitality and the opportunity to experience his world can't be nothing. If he frees Darcy, he hopes it will be okay with her too. But needs must... ",Roll

Unless I should have asked after him, maybe someone has to rescue him, and I gave up the chance?Guilty and anxious, waits for their answer... ",Roll

There's no room left for Cassie to panic, so she blots it out, focusing on her friend. As the monster pads over to them, Levi begins to rise, his voice a determined wobble.The victory is short-lived. Even as Helene and then Jordan spill into the cavern and start shouting, the god's voice rasps through Cassie's mind again. The beast is unclaimed. No wolf ever grew to be that size, no natural wolf, it has to be--""What the hell are you doing here Sam? Get out! Get the hell out-- it isn't safe for you!"" Her scream echoes around the cave.

You ditched me so I couldn’t help, and worse, you fucking brought Levi out here?!... so that you can get whatever’s inside you infecting him too?!

Investigation,">Over breakfast, a strange tingling sensation crawls over Emmerick's hand, the same that wears the gauntlet and now holds his tea cup. He glances down at it perplexed and blinks a couple times as he's almost positive that for a moment he saw his porridge bowl through the flesh of his hand. He chuckles to himself thinking his mind must need to catch on to the rest of his body waking up. This unseen business must be making him paranoid. He goes back to sipping his tea.After stopping by the mayor's he asks Bintz to meet him at the library at noon. He heads there to start his own research on matters of curses keeping in mind the substances used for it and trying to discern a possible source. He will also look up anything on the Forest King and the heart of the forest. ",Investigation
Investigation,">Teblin crawls out of bed around noon, eats some rations, and guzzles water from his water-skin. Sitting down on the floor next to his bed, he opens his spellbook and prepares his incantations for the day.About thirty minutes later he finishes his preparations and heads toward the Mastera Library. Once there, he consults Emmerick and attempts to search for similar topics. He also seeks out Yuri to see if he has any advice on how we might defeat this corruption in the forest. ",INVESTIGATION
Nature,">After resting and recovering from their ordeal in the cursed wood, Fyllin goes for a hike. Even though he very much enjoyed the one with Brandt a day or two ago, today he really needed to focus on himself and nature.Once he's outside the gate, he gets off the road as soon as possible. He takes a moment with his eyes closed, before he takes off running. After a few minutes of heavy breathing and sweat, he shakes his hair and flows into the body of a wolf, and keeps running through the forest. He runs and runs, bobbing and weaving around trees, crashing through the underbrush, and splashing through creeks and streams. Eventually, his mind isn't thinking cohesive thoughts, and is just breathing in the nature around him.Sitting down on his haunches on the edge of a clearing, he slows shifts back to his gnome body, sitting cross legged. He listens to the breeze through the branches around him, and feels it brush against his skin. He hears the songbirds, and opens his eyes to see a falcon sitting in a tree across the clearing. He hears rabbits and mice scuttling around. Closing his eyes again, he reaches his hands out and runs them through the grass around him. He digs his fingers into the dirt, and rubs it in his hands.Everything is in balance. Everything has its role. Fyllin thinks back to seeing the energy of life in the forest around him after consuming the leaf that Branch gave him. That energy starts in the earth, and flows though everything.And then there was that Darkness, whatever it was. From what he could tell, Branch and the Forest King worked to preserve the balance, the flow of energy. And then this Darkness came, and corrupted all that. But what was it? He felt the bite of death when it came over him, but was it that simple? Was it death incarnate? Or was it some force that bent the power of death to its will?Fyllin sits at the clearing, watching nature swirl around him, and hoping for inspiration for his questions to come from it. ",Nature

There were still so many unanswered questions and his curiosity was getting the best of him. Despite completing his immediate objective, he didn't think this assignment was going to end back in Womford. He was tied to this now. ""I am perfectly fine traveling at night if you all are,"" he says as he walks out of the hut. As the others gather their belongings together, he pulls out three of his daggers and sets them to leaping from one hand to the other following each other in a fluid weave of flashing silver. Juggling always set his mind at ease and helped him to focus. He thinks about the fragments of clues they have accumulated looking for connections that may previously had been overlooked... ...After several minutes of struggling to fit the pieces together, he snatches the knives out of the air and sheathes them.

Quick look around, (as much to gather a summary of our position as to prepare  for the next wave of attacks), apart from an Orc soldier writhing in agony at his feet (wounded or not?) he has a Black Uruk just behind that one, preparing to launch a counter attack   he can see that is facing his duel with a Black Uruk: the shield with his axe embedded in ti near the boy's feet;that Jot is recovering from a hard push by an enemy with a shield; protected partly by the resolute Champion ;that himself, is in fact very well placed to prevent the next attempt on the elven lady. 's immediate foes had been frustrated by his last move ;that Larsi was trading blows with a monster of an ugly brute, (and largely getting the better of that conflict, continuing his remarkable assault against the enemy);that Baldor is using the height gained from the rocky outcrop well and landing cuts across the head and face of his foe with an unerring accuracy, exploiting all the edges and advantages of the rocky ground, and the fact that the rockfall he has triggered seems to hinder his opponents as they move against him that Belgo, tear marks on  his face now drying, stands in front of the lady Irime still, somehow holding up one of the bucklers dropped by an orc soldier as a screenthat the lady herself stands still, poised and closely observant of all that is around her ....

Stealth,">Thrali and Skirfira lead Zaken without incident down one corridor and then another. Such is their sense of purpose that while a few passing dwarves cast curious glances towards the Lakeman, no one raises a question. By the time they make the final turn, they find themselves moving along in the company of several excited dwarves heading down the passage in the direction of raised voices, laughter, and cheering. They stop just as they reach one of the entrances to the forge chamber, stepping aside to let two members of Azan's house guard pass by at a grim-faced jog. Thankfully, once again, no questions are asked, the uproar ahead being too much of a draw.Thrali peers into the hall. It is a space he knows well, having spent number of his younger years charging these very furnaces. The space is dominated by a central tapering chimney forge carved from the same solid stone as the surrounding walls. An angry orange glow from the chimney's top lights the chamber's domed roof and a dizzying dark bore above for the exhaust gasses. The roar of the furnace mixes with the sound of falling water from the far side of the chamber, water which powers an elaborate system of bellows feeding air through an auxiliary furnace and into the central forge.For a few moments Thrali just stands and admires the pride of Azan. Then he looks round and sees to his satisfaction that many of the shift crew have left to investigate the commotion. Only a couple of greybeards remain to watch over the bellows and the inferno.""We only have a short window before the others will come back to tap the hearth and recharge the chimney. Zaken, remain by this doorway to delay any who return this way. Skirfira, you and I will need to gain the charging platform without being seen. We can dispose of our burdens into the flux shaft without anyone's being the wiser. Quickly now.""He moves quickly and quietly up a ladder to the platform and moves towards the chimney's opening. The roar and the heat are indescribable. ",stealth
Deception,">Thrali moves along the platform up to the curved wall of the chimney's top, its lip some six feet overhead. He looks for Skirfira, sees her still moving to the base of the ladder below. Sliding aside a wooden hatch backed by fire-proof bricks, he exposes a wide shaft slanting down through the wall of the furnace. Thrali steps back to avoid the initial blast of heat before peering cautiously down into the inferno, a fierce orange glow lighting his face. The forge has been freshly charged and pulsates malevolently.He moves to toss the green cloth bundle down the shaft but finds himself overcome with curiosity, having not actually seem the scabbard with his own eyes.He steps back from the shaft and carefully unwraps the bundle.The light from the furnace sparkles from every facet of the stones inset into the scabbard's surface and momentarily kindles a blaze in his own heart. Thrali looks around wildly for a way to escape with this treasure, sees Skirfira nearing the top of the ladder and Zaken watching intently from below near the door.He quickly rewraps the bundle and feels its hold on his heart lessen immediately, but he despairs that he will be able to consign it to the flames. He slumps down onto the platform with his back against the curved wall to the side of the shaft opening and cradles the bundle in his lap as he waits for Skirfira. ",corruption

People of this beautiful land! May the peace reign forever and our quarrel be ever resolved by words and mead and not by weapons and blood!”However, his voice failed to overcome the growing feast din, and the few who caught his words turned up their nose at them, thinking that talking about weapons and blood in such a merry occasion was strange and out of place.But did not care about the cold reaction to his wish, and he drank his mead anyway.

As soon as the companions' identities have been established, the heroes are free to mingle with the inn guests during the interaction. Riddle or Song rolls may be called on by the worthies of Bree. As usual, Insight rolls may be required if the companions wish to discover any secret motives hidden behind the guest's inquisitiveness, while Inspire and Persuade are needed to enliven the evening, or to win a heated debate.(As per usual, if a good argument can be made for a different skill for certain actions, I will allow it) ",Guest 1

Insight,">Luckily the round of drinks assist with his introduction, and any reluctance on the part of his audience will slowly be eroded as the ale takes effect. Mention of trading (1) gets a few of the Bree-based locals making enquiries about the fabled wealth of Erebor - with some vague allusions to one very rich hobbit who has passed through Bree once more in the past year it seems - it eases the atmosphere somewhat as the great distance involved strikes the locals with a bit of awe for these hardy travellers: who have made such a great effort 'just to come to Bree'.The small regular mounded hills to the south (2) are quickly named as The Barrows on the Barrow Downs. With ale down the throats of a few, some legends of spirits and bloodsuckers are mentioned, with the usual warning about people who have ventured there but never been seen again, and the 'advice' never to go there after midnight. One, slightly more in his cups than most, Rimba Wheatman, mentions a Wight-King, before he is hushed by a sharp prod from behind. No-one else wants that story.. The topic is quickly moved on by himself to say that the road to the Shire (3) is in good condition for the season.  He was visited just after Yule by five hobbits from Brandy Hall who were out looking for their first wild pheasant hunt of the New Year - a treat for Gorbadoc (Broadbelt) Brandybuck, the lord of Brandy Hall and father of Dodinas and Dinodas, who went east a while back.  His five visiting hobbits (headed by Rory Brandybuck and Rufus Burrows his friend) told him how the road was not damaged by the melted snow at all.The men from Coombe are now lubricated enough to offer information that the village had to beat off two separate raids on some of the outlying houses. On both times the raiders retreated north into the woods called Chetwood.  Herdsmen do not move their animals north of the village at all for foraging currently. there is concern that unless things improve, the south will be over-grazed.  There appears to be no cooperation or help from the Bowmen of Archet, One wife mutters that talk in Coombe is that the men of Archet are in league with the raiders.  (GS gains this extra information)Roll insight to think about this woman's comments, but it is easier to believe that she is simply bad-mouthing the other village rather than reporting a commonly held belief.

Performance,">Something about the Prancing Pony reminds him of the hearth fire in the great hall at Stoneyford. A few good evenings, usually soon after Yule and close to the same time of year as now, come to his mind. It inspires him to mention some chants and simple drinking songs and he is asked to sing some. Again the boy-man is experiencing a moment of personal growth. With a small approving nod from Larsi, he will launch into such a song. It is surprisingly familiar across the mountains and several of the Bree-worthies find it very easy to join in (after roll edit) right at the beginning of his effort he almost falters, but a special extra push (add 1 Hope, changing  a failure into a GS). It gathers a round of applause and an encore. ",Song

The village Green is just outside the inn, with an area clearly set out for practice at one side.And he will start on the bow - (three or four Successes say?) over the next three days. He asks to stand up and then gauges the right size of the wood needed, and prepares by cutting down a few of his own arrows to fit the proposed size of 's short bow.One of the locals, Jomi Goatleaf, is interested, as he too has got a new bow made for him by one of the master bowmen of Archet last autumn.  Jomi offers to join them tomorrow (when a lot more sober) on the Green.

Atiya tried, and Sarah appreciated her for trying, but sometimes a trained hand was an unavoidable necessity.And then the slave girl began doing other things. Things Sarah remembered doing when she had been made to be pleasing. Things that made her toes curl in the water as it swishes and splashes lightly around her moving hips. When she began lightly kissing her shoulders and hit that one spot that sent shivers down her spine, Sarah could see why Harn was reluctant to let this girl go.

Then, it split into dozens of tendril-like appendages that reached into the building from vents, windows, doors and more.

Guided From Beyond the Pale Weird Move ,">The bit Chastain says about reaching out within to see the future makes cock her head with interest as she contemplates her own vættrskurðr and what it might now show. She swiftly discards any chance of a direct connection to her—even if coded messages might fall well inside his wheelhouse—rejecting the reference as mere coincidence. While it certainly isn't impossible the venerable philanthropist (who is clearly something more) has chanced upon Dǫkkálfr spirit brands in the past, there are undoubtedly many other interpretations. That particular avenue isn't really a useful means of self-exploration anyway in her case.His concealed words on the dangerously changing times and signs that speak of unforeseeable fates fill with a disquieting sense of nostalgia. For the first time in a very long while, she finds herself thinking of her allies lost to uniformed beasts masquerading as men and the devotees to unholiest science so many decades before. She yearns briefly for someone trustworthy to speak with who is not inextricably bound to this realm, wondering what the dauntless brute Mǫttull, crafty spellshaper Klǿingr, and irrepressibly resourceful scout Ósk would do if their positions were reversed. Surely their skillsets would have granted them a very dissimilar outlook. When the abstruse proclamation concludes, does not move forward to offer friendly accolades to their host along with the appreciative and grasping rabble. That simply isn't her style. Instead she feels her lip curling with disdain for the vacuous Midgardian smiles and outstretched mortal fingertips, all seeming so terribly, unabashedly vulnerable. Could these little rabbits ever begin to comprehend the truth lying naked, patient and insidious within the darkness that filled so many corners of their happy forest home?   knows she could scarcely bear to rub elbows with such impermanent beings at this time. She acknowledges that she is not the only extraordinary entity among this assembled host but that doesn't mean there's anything else quite like her in attendance.Even as a part of her regrets being the last dark elf on this plane—genuinely missing those departed allies and their unique skillsets which had been so carelessly tossed to the unforgiving, unappeasable entropy— accepts that she is not without assets of her own. The proud Nazi fools and their sniveling collaborators among the Norsemen had locked her up in the belief that she was the least threatening and of diminished value in comparison to the others but that, as wise humans say, had just been their opinion. Some on this world might think of her as a priest, shaman or cultist and, while none of these definitions fit her role perfectly, it is fair to say her fidelity to and reverence for the tremendous, unfathomable power of the Corrupted Void called Fúinnginnung are features representing much of what defines as a sapient being. As Eyðahǫfuð—One Who Is Empty—she communes with the Lost Beyond not to beg favors or supernal forbearance but to open herself to otherwise inaccessible clarity.She does this now as the restless party-goers mill insignificantly about her. The child Cas is a fan of nature documentaries and, sitting at their side before the glowing slate called television, has grown to appreciate the stark and unapologetic savagery of the myriad fauna from all over Midgard. An image forms in her head of mighty crocodiles eerily closing that third eyelid as they immerse themselves to reign through fear and supreme confidence over their underwater kingdoms. The sensation of treating with the Corrupted Void is a little like that but also nothing at all like anything the substantial body can quantify. All things, physical or immaterial, living, dead or inanimate are irrevocably connected to that unplace. It is not so difficult to skim the surface in search of perspective if one is willing to tease the inescapable fate of nothingness and, perhaps, pay a toll.It has been a very long time since reached out to the Beyond but a reunion seems prudent to obtain the guidance she seeks. Right now, all she really wants to know is how she should react to Chastain's puzzling overtures, whether she should cooperate with whatever he's planning or contradict his directives. Should he be considered an ally or a threat to what values, an opportunity or a complication? ",Guided From Beyond the Pale (Weird Move)

If we tarry the trail grows cold, or may be hidden, and we lose time on the thieves. Do the orcs now watch us so closely as to pounce the very instant we are weakened?

Sneak,">The night’s shadows are dark and deep, and the moon’s pale reflection guides my way home. It’s quite late by the time I left Atomsk. Again. Magnus wanted to get an early start the next morning, to be off on another of his “fishing trips”. So, he left me to close up shop. Again. Now, with my satchel full of borrowed books (let’s see what you have to offer, Ms. Anne Rice. Interview with the Vampire, indeed) and a discarded and cracked Magnetrine conductor’s lamp I rescued, I caught the last bus north towards home and drifted my way along the silent streets. Only a small herd of reindeer noted my passage. No one else does. I drift like a ghost through the village, past closed doors and shuttered windows of other homes, or like a vampire on the hunt. The thought makes me smile. Only the looming Boma towers with their Cyclopean lights seem to imply any disapproval. Always watching, always keeping their own counsel, but never silent. Even at this hour, I can feel the low bass rumble of the Loop under my feet, like Jörmungandr, ever restless, and hungry.    I have to write that down. It’s too poetic to forget.     I doubt my parents are waiting up for me, but I’d rather not give them an opportunity to express their disapproval concern of the day. So, I leave the road and creep along the treeline, past woodpile and tarp-covered snowmobile and my mother’s light blue Saab (ugh), to the point where my bedroom window faces the lake. I left the window unlocked, and ever so gently I ease the shutters open and the sash up to sneak into my darkened room. ",Sneak
Empathize,">   The telephone receiver dangles from its spiral cord, oscillating slowly like a pendulum towards its final point of equilibrium. (see, I was paying attention in Physics) A disembodied voice can be heard, as if from a distance.          “…said that, but I was overruled. I’m sorry. Prim-1 is cycling and already at 15% capacity, with…” Besides the voice, I’m alone in the room. The door that leads to the back side of the building, where Mom’s neglected garden boxes sit in endless anticipation of attention and the firepit sits, unlit and cold, sways gently on its hinges. Its slow *sqweak* calls my attention to it, and beyond its open frame. There, in the distance, at the edge of the forest, beyond the small meadow of grass behind this blighted subdivision of Riksenergi corporate housing, a flash of white, as the image of my mother’s housecoat flapping behind her disappears into the shadows.    What the hell…? Where on God’s green earth is she going? There’s nothing out there, not in that direction…”Mom? Mom?! MOM!” I call to the empty air, as I start running after her.             “Just where do you think you’re going, young lady? And, at this hour? You should be in bed, asleep, not inconsiderately shouting your head off! You come inside, RIGHT…NOW…!”    I never even heard my father’s car, but there he was, behind me, calmly picking up the phone receiver from the floor and hanging up on whoever had been apologizing on the other end of the connection without even acknowledging the caller.        “But…Dad! Mom just fucking ran off, right into the woods, wearing nothing but her nightgown! She got some weird call on the phone, and then just took off. She didn’t even get dressed or take an electric torch with her. We have to go after her!”             “Do not take that tone of voice with me, and you watch your tongue! If I say ‘come inside’, you ‘come inside’! Your mother is a grown woman, and she knows what she is doing. I am confident that she knows what she is doing. If she felt the need to run out in the middle of the night, and her job is involved, then, that is her prerogative, and not for you to question. You, however, are not grown, not yet, and, until you are, as our daughter, you will do what your parents tell you to.  And, as your father, I am telling you to go to bed. Now, young lady, right now!”    I have nothing to say in response. What’s with him? Why doesn’t he go after her?     My racing heartbeat slows, as, in shock, I go to my bedroom and close the door, but not before spying my father take, with shaking hand, a bottle of aquavit and a single glass from the cupboard and drop heavily into a chair by the kitchen table.   ",Empathize
Mind,">   The sun’s barely broken over the trees, and the morning fog still clings stubbornly to the trees before I’m out the door. I pause only to drape a throw over my snoring father, head resting on his crossed arms on the table where he fell asleep during the night, before grabbing my bike and pedaling over to Astrid’s house. I need a sympathetic ear to make some sense of this new chaos in my life.  ",Mind
Investigation,">      “I’m holding up OK. I didn’t sleep. Not even a little. I mean, the dark forest is no place for an adult, you know,” I say, with a meager attempt at a smile on my face.      “And then, to top it all off, I saw this kid staring at me from the trees when I left my house to come see you. About our age. Maybe a little younger. Blonde hair. Haven’t seen him before in school. Maybe his family moved here over the summer. Another Riksenergi orphan, I’ll bet.”      “But, what was …off, was, well, it was the way he stared,…just strange. He didn’t even try to hide. He was just standing there out in the open, staring. Like a statue.”       “Anyway, we can head back to my house. Dad will probably have left for the Loop already, so I’m pretty sure we won’t have to run into him. If there’s something there to find, well, two sets of eyes are better than one, and I really appreciate your help.”    A short bike ride in the reverse direction brings us back to my house. As expected, my father’s car is gone. Everything inside seems to be in order, save for the empty aquavit bottle in the recycling bin and the solitary shot glass drying out on the dish rack, both the only remaining testimony to my story.  So, where to begin…?  ",Investigate
Roll,"> Astrid returns a confident smirk at her cousin's attempt to keep spirited, sympathetically reaching for and squeezing her arm in reassurance. ""I know. We'll find her, Hanna. You can count on me."" She states, without falter, before leaving her a moment back to the foot of her bed, reaching for her favored jacket on the edge, and slipping it over her head carefully, so as to not completely undo her grooming efforts from before. ""Aunt Kara hasn't been the kindest to me, but she's still family. I'm still gonna make sure she's okay, if she's in some kind of trouble."" She states, as she steps towards her the mirror set against her dresser, and takes a few corrective strokes with her brush to set her hair how she likes it, before casually tossing the brush on her bed.  Finally satisfied with her state, she returns to Hanna, and offers a grin, craning her neck to the door. ""Let's roll!"" She casually states, before leading her out her bedroom door. Unlike the Nilsson household, Ash had little reason to fear her mother's nagging at this hour, so she simply heads out through the front door, although she keeps relatively quiet, until they've properly left the house. ""So, you've been seeing that little freak too?"" She asks, while making way to the shed to collect her bike. ""One of your new neighbors, right? Äng, I think their name is. Yeah, I've found him peeping at me a few times as well. I was walking down Torslundavägen just yesterday, and I could feel his eyes on me."" She states, as she opens the shed, and stands up her bike from the ground. The blue-haired rebel arches her brow towards her cousin with, tinged with concern. ""That creep didn't see you heading for my house, did he? Maybe I should start closing my windows and curtains at night. He strikes me as a perv. You should probably keep your windows locked too.""Once her bike was ready, Ash followed Hanna back towards her house, each on their bikes. The ride didn't lend itself to much discussion, but much more didn't need to be said for now. They'd both practiced the back-woods route that allowed them to reach each other's house, using the small dirt roads between the local farms and rural ranches, and even small bits off the beaten path to cut a lot of the time. Reaching Sanga-Saby from the cul-de-sac using only the main roads would take around 45 minutes if left only to the main roads, but their method cut that time in half, even less than 20 if they pushed themselves. It didn't take them long before they were walking their bikes into her garage, and into the house proper, thankfully by themselves. ""Well, that makes things easy for us. How 'bout you have a peak at your parent's room and office? Feels more appropriate for you to do that. I'll hang around the den, living room and kitchen, and see if I can find anything."" ",Roll
ConvinceHonor Point ,">Sarah returns Romana's nod approvingly, and smiles. There is the woman she remembered who could turn men this way and that with a few choice words. ""Weapons shouldn't be hard to find, weren't they selling some here in the marketplace?"" she tells her former lover who at that point still seems unsure despite his commitment. Now that things have been properly explained to her, she feels a great deal more comfortable actually speaking. ""Even without them you give off an air that you are not to be trifled with, and no one will trifle with you. Nothing is certain, of course; you know that better than most. He might call a bluff, or he might not. Either way, not going to this meeting and deciding instead to run will send the wrong message to the other chieftains watching. It sucks and is more than uncomfortable, but this is the best way to recover that artifact before Nasir uses it to unite the other tribes beneath his banner.""Only now, far belatedly did Sarah realize that she should have listened to her own words. Lekhshey was present, and still very much a hill girl. If she were to slip away and warn her chieftain about Maximus's plans that would be disastrous for everyone at the table. A quick glance told Sarah that she was more than unhappy, but luckily she was still present. Her loyalty must be dealt with, quickly.""Not that I or my girls have any love of Treve, mind you,"" she nonchalantly reminds everyone gathered. ""In fact, in general, I can't say I have any love for any city that lords itself over people that don't wish to be lorded over. It would be a shame, a great shame, if something were to happen to old friends after the bargain we've made, but life would move on I suppose."" Taking a sip of her paga, she lets her message sink in, yet covertly gives a wink to Romana. Maximus too likely saw it, given how close the two were together. ""But my girls and I would have to get out of these hills, captive slaver trash in tow,"" she continues, glancing over her shoulder at every one of her women, lastly lingering on Lekhshey. ""And that would prove difficult if the Priest Kings decide to punish Peshi Puza and the Pamiri tribe with blue fire."" Looking back to Romana, she elaborates for the sake of the others gathered.

Wild Die,">Sarah returns Romana's nod approvingly, and smiles. There is the woman she remembered who could turn men this way and that with a few choice words. ""Weapons shouldn't be hard to find, weren't they selling some here in the marketplace?"" she tells her former lover who at that point still seems unsure despite his commitment. Now that things have been properly explained to her, she feels a great deal more comfortable actually speaking. ""Even without them you give off an air that you are not to be trifled with, and no one will trifle with you. Nothing is certain, of course; you know that better than most. He might call a bluff, or he might not. Either way, not going to this meeting and deciding instead to run will send the wrong message to the other chieftains watching. It sucks and is more than uncomfortable, but this is the best way to recover that artifact before Nasir uses it to unite the other tribes beneath his banner.""Only now, far belatedly did Sarah realize that she should have listened to her own words. Lekhshey was present, and still very much a hill girl. If she were to slip away and warn her chieftain about Maximus's plans that would be disastrous for everyone at the table. A quick glance told Sarah that she was more than unhappy, but luckily she was still present. Her loyalty must be dealt with, quickly.""Not that I or my girls have any love of Treve, mind you,"" she nonchalantly reminds everyone gathered. ""In fact, in general, I can't say I have any love for any city that lords itself over people that don't wish to be lorded over. It would be a shame, a great shame, if something were to happen to old friends after the bargain we've made, but life would move on I suppose."" Taking a sip of her paga, she lets her message sink in, yet covertly gives a wink to Romana. Maximus too likely saw it, given how close the two were together. ""But my girls and I would have to get out of these hills, captive slaver trash in tow,"" she continues, glancing over her shoulder at every one of her women, lastly lingering on Lekhshey. ""And that would prove difficult if the Priest Kings decide to punish Peshi Puza and the Pamiri tribe with blue fire."" Looking back to Romana, she elaborates for the sake of the others gathered. ""This artifact was stolen from the Priest Kings, no? -"" a quick glance around those assembled showed that neither she nor Talya were present, along with one other male, ""-wherever she is, brought up a point that weighs on me. When the Priest Kings discover that Nasir is using this artifact, and they will discover this, then won't they bathe the Pamiri -the entire Voltai mountain range- in their wrath?

The redheaded newly inducted Panther Girl was still trying to come to terms with the realities of her new life, and had asked a similar question, even proposing that maybe there should be somewhere in the Northern Forest that recently freed women could go if they didn't make the cut to be a Panther. Sarah had sighed and said that no such place existed, that as dangerous as the forests were they were the safest place that a woman could go and be truly free, but that danger did not allow softness of weakness. What she didn't tell her, what she should have told her, was that she had asked the same exact question, even going so far as to search for a place far from Gorean civilization where such a place could exist. She had even found one, north of the Northern Forests in an untouched corner of Gor. It was a good land, if cold, nut no worse off than the British Isles or the Nordic countries back home. But building a city for freed slaves and runaway women was beyond her capabilities. Perhaps now, though, with the Kur ship intact and hidden somewhere nearby and friends in powerful positions, such an endeavor might be worth revisiting.

She knows the woman well, and knows she lies more convincingly than most tell the truth. She also knows that the woman has tells, small subtle things that give her away. Sarah spots one or two...or does she? Can she just be imagining it, projecting her guilt unjustly onto her friend and wanting her to be guilty of worse crimes than she herself committed? Or has Romana simply gotten better at lying since they last saw each other? In the end, Sarah does not know if she believes her. She also does not know if Rhea had been truthful when she had said what she did during their bath; Sarah had openly admitted to being Romana's friend, and from her description the little slave tart was both ruthless and manipulative. It would not be beyond the girl Romana described to try to plant a seed of discord between two friends, one of which she had already made her enemy. That did not mean that Romana was innocent of the accusation; Sarah had indeed seen a tell or two that she had been looking for that told her that her friend may be lying. But all things considered, there was enough history between the two to where Sarah felt she could give her the benefit of the doubt.""There are no chains in the Northern Forests,"" Sarah said definitively. ""None but those we place about the necks of intruders and trespassers. No men force us to dress and talk and act like they wish us to, either as a perfumed slave girl or a 'free' woman covered in bedsheets. Men are at our mercy there, and if it is a prison then it is as vast as this mountain range we wander through. If more women behaved as we did then those prisons wouldn't exist.  I will not stay with you to your gilded prison, I am done being locked inside a cage. But...I will do what I can to return you to it, if that is what you want.""Sighing softly, Sarah takes Romana's hand and holds it close.

Then he turned the horse and shouting at the top of his voice, he charged her adversaries taking them from behind.“Gooondoor!! Death’s upon you!

Battle,">Hearing the terrible shout behind them, the orcs who were attacking turned round all of a sudden. Then they saw a horseman and his horse going at full speed against them. The dying sunlight shone with a red light on his sword and helm, so they seemed with a great dismay to see flames burning on his sword and coming out of his eyes.Cruel though they were, they could not sustain that fearsome view: their black hearts filled with a wild fear, while their hands, paralysed by the terror, dropped their weapons on the ground.Then, as if they were spurred by a silent recall, they began to run at breakneck speed back to the mountains and holes where they had come out from. ran after them for a little while, then, seeing that there was need to fight no more , he reined up and went back to the spot where was. “I hope you’re well, my Lady! And that those vile creatures had not had the chance to cause any danger to your fair person!” said courteously to the elf. But, as an answer, instead of the musical voice of the lady, he heard another female voice shouting a deadly challenge far away.He turned towards the voice trying to see who was crying such a battle cry and whom her challenge was directed to.“Look!” Said pointing far away with her graceful hand.He looked ahead in the direction she was pointing out to, and he saw the village lady riding proudly out of the gate against a huge orc who was standing out of it.“That shouldn’t have been!” He muttered to himself. Then added aloud:“They aren’t honourable creatures at all, and surely won’t respect her challenge for a single combat. She would be broken to pieces if someone didn’t help her...”Then he saw the small figure or a man riding like the wind with an unsheathed sword towards the lady and the orc chieftain. Recognising the horseman as , he breathed with relief. “We’re too far away to help her with our swords, my lady, however, perhaps our bows could reach what our arms cannot.”And having said that, he unshouldered his bow, then, stringing it, he looked for a right spot where to shoot from.  ",Battle
Bow,">“My lady,” he began a little embarrassed, speaking to  , “If the old stories tell the truth, your elvish bow can hit such a distant target.

They are denser and tougher than he'd expected, but with the powerful claws, he is only slowed a little and soon he's dug out the ground around the limbs clinging to the sword. He can actually feel the plant begin to grow again and fill in the parts he clawed through, but not quickly. With the sword partially free from the most immediate branches, he grabs the hilt with both paws and sets the clawed feet against limb and dirt and pulls. At first it doesn't come free and Fyllin can feel the plants start to wrap their limbs around his legs. It finally just won't budge and a little panicked about being trapped in here, Fyllin lets go and whips around back into the hole and begins widening it in hopes of getting some help.Moments after you see Fyllin give up and begin shifting dirt all over the place, the rest of you hear something further up the trail.

Insight,">(assuming the sight of Dale, entering through the gates, lifts his Misery)Zaken, nonetheless will stand behind the dwarves and the hobbit. The Thegn often looks at these characters while speaking, so the Lakeman has plenty of time to judge this noble's character.(For first time arrivals at Bard's court: this party have few positive memories of the nobles who hang around the King trying to be heard and to influence policy.1. Lord Hakun - a right haughty git, dismissive of our reports of Orcs in Dale - until we dragged a body in!2. Lord Gunvar - a traitor and terrorist rebel, now locked up in Erebor. (Some of his contacts need tracing, e.g. Niping.)3. - our current speaker - exhibiting all the public charisma and warmth of a iced fish4. Lord Bryni - absentee Lord with a huge budget spent on clothes, (room to spare inside his skull) might have a money problem5. Captain - The one really Good Guy so far. He has supported our efforts. Commands a character, Bramnir, who we can call on if helpful.6. Thegn Osgar - VERY much part of a faction that sees the Dwarves as taking unfair advantage of the new city. So,  a loyal citizen, just narrow minded and maybe even nationalistic?(OOC: After roll: is a GS enough to see if Jofur is just being as polite as the court protocol demands, or if he takes against us as Osgar might, when seeing Dwarves?) ",Insight
Persuasion,">Thinks to himself, and he will share with( the others soon after, ""Aah. This one knows he is being observed: either Bard is within earshot, or some other noble is around and he is trying to  be informative without looking like a blabber mouth. He might respond to sensitive enquiries...""Zaken will step up to speak, just cutting off , who looks like he also has a few things to ask, ""On behalf of my friends, I thank you for your praises, .  You have explained the history of this scholar well. All is clear about his purpose and importance to King Bard and to the great city of Dale, "" (it is quite easy for Zaken, the mercurial negotiator, to emulate the high-falutin style of courtiers:  overdressing language simply to pace out the delivery)""Of course, we realise that there is more to your story. If it is acceptable to ask for some further information about this missing scholar, we would like to know where he was travelling from, and his planned route,  and if there were any messages that show where he was last seen.""He bows in a style that makes the Thegn smile a little. ",Courtesy

",Insight
Insight,">Not surprised that 's overheard comment didn't help. His cousin was too direct there. ( quick use of Insight to see if there is a route for his next effort to persuade a bit more from the courtier)(aah. He thinks: the look on Jofur's face as he delivers both comments  concerning the health of Bard, the man is loyal alright. And worried for the ill King.) ",Insight
Riddle,">""Does he bring anything with him?"" Sigeric asks bluntly from his reward position among the group. He still seems unfamiliar with the group, and as such is guarded in his closeness with them, but it seems in this case he is more concerned with his hound. The massive canine sits on its haunches beside him, obediently looking between those talking as if he understood what was being said. Given the dog's height, Sigeric is able to easily keep his hand resting on the back of the creature's neck - keeping him calm and the appearance to those wary of the beast that he has it firmly under control. ""Is there anything we should be expecting to bring back with us besides himself?"" Sigeric's question attempts to subtly pry at what business or importance this dwarf has with King Bard. ",Riddle
Persuasion,">""May we ask more of you, Lord Jofur?"" Zaken has closely watched the Thegn to see what he is uncomfortable about: he has a blank face towards Thrali and Skirfira. He relaxes more when looking at Amdir or at the wood elves next to Sigeric. Is it embarrassment, or is this man one of Thegn Osgar's faction. Either this courtier knows that the loss of the dwarf is due to some failing or fault of Bard's realm: or he simply opposes the mission of the scholar.""I feel that this open court area is too crowded for simple discussion, sir. You have said that the scholar will be coming here with some important knowledge. If this is about the security of this realm, we are too exposed for an experienced diplomat like yourself to be able to let simple adventurers like ourselves know what we should learn. "" in a lower tone, and sympathetic, ""I presume that your position is at risk if we fail. Rest assured that if we ask Captain to join us he will be able to tell you of our calibre. We can do this: if we are told all the details you can... by your grace.""This is a major effort by Zaken, whose curiosity alone would bring this intensity: he also does not want to leave this encounter with Jofur thinking poorly of him or his friends.

Persuasion,">This one appears to hold the dwarves as competitors: almost a threat to his king's plan. He must feel that they will take the scholar to Dain. Time to allay that fear.The group are more to one side now. Amdir will show the commitment of the group to the exact mission in a subtle manner.""We will need to learn of the route taken by this Domi. Only if we know where to go to, can we come back with what King Bard desires.  I have limited  awareness  of the area around Dale, so some assistance about the direction to start looking in would be of great help.  You could request Captain to send an officer of his militia with us to guide us and keep us on the right track.""At the same time, Amdir will prompt the other members  of the fellowship to add their offers of help. ",Courtesy
History,">Jofur's last comments show that the courtier has only a vague grasp of life outside the city. No doubt he is a skilled diplomat (perhaps); but he is no traveller. He has clearly listened to many tall tales of how dreadful life is outside the city walls - probably over large meals and many drinks in any of the taverns like the Missing Scale. He probably has no idea of the time it takes to travel (if you are not on roads like the last trip). Amdir has moved up from far to the south. A week's delay is no great amount, unless the scholar was already quite close. This courtier must have had some news more recently about Domi's progress. (Uses Lore to think about the journey - he will have been told of the Blue Mountains when back in Lorien)(after roll: which gives him a good feel for the distances involved) He thinks quickly: with his earlier history he sailed up the Anduin, travelled the elf path across Mirkwood to Laketown - via Thranduil's halls - and then up to Dale, he has now gone on to the Iron Hills and back. It was very much quicker along the road. But, taking a wagon through Mirkwood? Such a story would be all over Wilderland! So this scholar will have gone over the northern route: AROUND the forest. And that has rivers to cross with wagons. Such crossings can take a week even for small caravans: the elves build a carry cradle and swing the wagons across. (A day's work for one wagon.) The wood elves have concealed materials to get wagons and carts across the Forest Stream: and it has long been held that the dwarves have similar: for those in the 'know'. Going around the great forest of the north is more than 150 leagues. (OOC: 500 miles roughly) And the Blue Mountains are at least as far again past the High Pass. No, Jofur is misinformed, or is simply throwing out a wild guess at the travel time.""Let me be frank, Lord Jofur. It is clear to me that the last message about Domi's progress has made you estimate his arrival should have been no more than a week or so back. And the scholar was using a wagon and coming from the west? That makes barely 50 leagues away - at most.  How did the message arrive? Raven perhaps? The birds have long been allies of the men of Dale. So let me deduce this: if birds are your messengers, then birds are your spies too. The dwarf has disappeared hasn't he? Tell us if all of the wagon train he was with has also disappeared? Or has it been attacked? You must know.""Assuming his deductions about the bird messenger system are valid, this logic should oblige the noble to come clean with any more information he has. ",Lore
Intimidation,">Thrali tries to ignore the lingering headache and the sense of unease he has carried with him since the ill-fated night in the storm. The bandying words back and forth between Jofur and the others have made little sense to him. How is it that humans can say so much to each other while making clear that much is left unsaid? There was, however, a tantalizing mention of orcs? Nothing would ease Thrali's troubled mind like the chance to swing his mattock.The interminable, inscrutable talking continues. Thrali's scowl grows with every passing minute. He is mightily relieved when Amdir demands answers.""Yes, I would have plain talk. The Blue Mountains are far removed from my home in the Iron Hills, but its inhabitants are Durin's Folk. If Domi needs our aid, I am eager to render it"" As he speaks, Thrali unhooks his mattock from behind his shoulder and swings it around to lean upon in front of him like a staff. The move is casual and not particularly threatening, but Thrali suddenly looks more like a warrior than a disheveled, past-his-prime elder.Or at least such is his intent. But the atmosphere in the room suddenly changes, the guards quickly coming to alertness. Thrali feels all eyes on him. His head is pounding. He has had enough. ""Out with it, Jofur!"" he shouts. ""I will not""--now pounding the mattock's shaft into the floor with each word--""Take. Kindly. To. Dithering!"" ",Awe
Intimidation,">Fair enough, the Lakeman replies to the noble. Accept my apology . I am of House Mostar; Bowman of the Guild and a successful bowyer from Esgaroth. Perhaps if you need something in that department, I can help.Taking a deep breath before continuing, I confess to know little of the events and am here at the behest of Zaken, gestures to his cousin, so I may lend assistance to the Company. ",Awe
Persuasion,">""I think that Amdir is right. If Domi cleared the Narrows between Mirkwood and the Grey Mts, then he will have been lost while on the trade route - and there may well be tracks up to that point. And that will show us which way to go next.If Domi disappeared before that, then the quickest way to the Narrows entrance is along the trade route anyway.If Domi went into the forest: we have to leave it all to Amdir and the Woodelves.Of course, there is one obvious line of enquiry to explore..."" turns to Jofur,""Sir, please permit us access to any records or clues concerning this mausoleum. Domi may simply have left his route and gone straight there without telling you. He may even now be working with the dwarves of Erebor...""(this last comment is a ploy to 'encourage' Jofur to realise that the fellowship need every help to succeed.

As the ogre’s club slams into his deceased companion’s head blue blood sprays over the half-elf. The bard’s luck had not all run out and he was able to instinctively close his eyes before being striped in blue ogre blood. Annoyed with the way that this day was going he says to himself, “Shiny, let’s be bad guys.” Stepping through the opening in the wall Raf looks both ways down the alleyway, his companions would see the image of someone who appeared to have taken a handful of ogre blood and wiped it across his face. The half-elf’s usual jovial eyes now burned with a fierce intensity. While he usually preferred to convince people through deceit or persuasion, was also proficient in shifting his entire appearance to be far more intimidating than one would expect for his size. “I knew you cunts were stupid, but I never thought I could underestimate how stupid.” The bard’s voice was biting and the ogres would find themselves discouraged.  With no weapon in hand stares at the ogre, “You truly do not understand how much you have fucked up.” The half-elf chuckles slightly shaking his head. ”Here is the deal, you and your friends,” casting a glance to the fallen ogre, “friend, tell us everything about the one who sent you, the one with the mutilated circumcision of a face. I want to know who and why. Cooperate, and you get to walk away from here, something not many can boast. Or…” Raf uses Prestidigitation to create the smell of sulfur and brimstone, a sadistic smile taking his face, “I take my time with both of you, and explore the definition of what pain is.” Taking a finger, Raf wipes some of the blood from his face and licks it off his finger as if jam, never breaking eye contact.  understood that his new position may cause him to take some injury during the calamity, but he was a fool-hardy bard who still thought himself invincible.    ((Intimidation check 13, Bonus Action Cutting Words, 1d10 below to be used against Intimidation check)) ",Cutting Words

While understood that not all folk had the fortitude to stand toe to toe with ogres or other hostiles, there was still a crowd, even if many had made for cover. What had begun as a rote, mundane day had transformed into a whirlwind of intrigue and danger, and it was ironic that on the way to the dockmaster’s he had been lamenting his boredom to Kalen. While still focusing on the task at hand ’s mind was also considering who this Scarred Man was, what Bellamin had done to deserve such attention, and what was in the crate they were to transport.

We have one resourceful individual after us, I don’t want to add another.” With the deposit, gaining passage by sea would not be out of the question, and would serve to keep ogres from sneaking in the back door as it were.  Turning back to his whisky focuses on how the main target of the day’s attacks was Bellamin. Bellamin could be a hothead, but he was not known for being one that would go out to instigate a fight with someone.

Time is of the essence; we have nine days to make delivery.” Taking a large drink of whisky, “There are enchantments on this parcel that if attempts are made to circumvent the locks, Lord Baric will know, and rather than us collecting the rest of our 50,000 gold, we will be in the Lord’s debt for 100,000 gold…” leaves this to sink in. Pouring another measure of whisky, it was a good day for the drink, feels it stick in his throat at the mention of drow from Santiago. Forcing it down, the bard remembered stories his father told of the dark elves and their hatred for all surface dwellers, especially surface elves. “I cannot recall any dealings with drow for my part.” Thinking more on the drow situation remembers the strange things he ‘heard’ before the commotion with the ogres. Where the two connected? Standing with Santiago, the half-elf makes an inventory of his gear. “I’m going to collect my things and see to provisioning supplies for the journey. The package we are to deliver are too large for our current mounts, so a wagon may be necessary.” Moving to the stairs, every shudder of the building causing a flinch, “Maybe with the drow situation it would be best for us to make our way to Waterdeep by sea. If we stay close to the shore we should be able to avoid bad weather and pirates. The drow may have power magic working for them, but I don’t imagine there’s much sailing experience in the Underdark.” In his room he noticed that the room was out of order, but nothing jumped out at the bard. With the way that things had gone, still gave his pack and gear a once over. Coming back down stairs and stepping back onto the high road, he looks to Santiago, “I’ll meet you and the others north of the docks.

Caeldrim enjoys the second glass of whiskey. He follows Raf up to his room to collect his gear so we can move. The swaying of the building doesnt effect him as he gathers his things from his now somewhat ransacked room. Once done putting his pack together he grabs a couple bottles of whiskey for the road since this place isnt going to need it.""So are we staying together or are separating til tomorrow.

As the innkeeper came to their table, nodded a greeting and was interested by the dwarf’s accent and speech pattern. “I’ll be drinking your finest dwarven spirits.” It had been some time since he had tasted it, but could think back to dwarven fire whiskey, the dwarves said that the secret was the clerics beseeched Moradin’s blessing, but the bard expected that the fermenting tanks were held above the forges that ran night and day.   gave a selection of coins to the dwarf to coax any information he may have, and for his discretion. “Pardon me gentlemen, I must indulge myself.” After taking hold of his lute, the bard approaches the musicians and gets their approval to sit in for a song. explains the gist of the song and after warming up with a few strums begins singing, the notes of the song invoked the feeling of an epic adventure, with a shade of tomfoolery.  “Oh, the dragon's balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles with a long and shiny blade 'Twas I who fucked the dragon, fuckalizing fuckaloo And if you try to fuck with me, then I shall fuck you too.” The previous residence at the Laughing Gnome would have never been receptive to this ballad, but this inn would find the humor in the song and cheer as the song played.  From where he was playing gave the entrance of the inn an intense once over, looking for signs of nervous folk, or those who might be exuding anxiety.   Thanking the musicians for allowing him to join their set for a song and promising to come back for another song later in the night, the bard returns to his companions ready for food, drink, plotting, and any information the innkeeper may have.

History,">Settling into the common room amongst his companions, Bellamin reflects on the events of the day. He was relatively sure he had heard one of the Ogres rumble something about a little man and the ""merchant"" that had led the attack in the marketplace seemed to have had a special interest in Bellamin as well. Unfortunately the halfling had a tendency to let his mouth run more often than not, however his fists had always been able to back up the insults that had always sprung forth. Surely he had made a plethora of enemies in his past, but had he offended one enough to pursue him to such reckless ends?((History check))Breaking from his reflections Bellamin recognized a familiar aching in his loins, after Cael placed his order for grub and drink Bellamin added to the order ""Innkeep! Might you send over a few of your 'staff' to keep me company as well? It has been at least 12 hours since I was last comforted!"" Bellamin scans the room for any potential single use companions.

Performance,">Drinking and toasting by the fire after a long working day to rebuild the damaged door of the village, heard a group of Dunlendins challenging one another to a singing contest. He could not understand the words of their language, but he liked their exotic melody made of unpolished but very effective tunes. That gave him the idea of composing a song to pay homage to Lady Edelyn, hero of the Battle of Stanshelf, and as a gift to his companions. He based his song on a Gondorian melody traditionally used to celebrate a victory and pay honour to those heroes who sacrificed themselves for the good of their land and the safeness of their companions.The sun was red when they came like a slidedown from the mountains to burn and slaughterthey flooded fields and barns like a black tidethey wanted the Lady to tear asunderThe sun was red when the spears were thrown and like a rain of stars they fell on themwhile the Lady rode against their chieftain aloneher spearhead shone like a red fearful gemThe sun was red like an opening budwhen challenged the vile creatureand watered his sword with its black bloodbut he did not pierce its iron armourThe sun was red like a bloody tearwhen Banog’s mount was woundedbreaking with its fall his horseman’s spearwho, nimble like a bird, with a jump dismountedThe sun was red when ' voice rangclear and bright like a morning starpiercing like an arrow the battle clangmarking foes' hearts with a light scarThe sun was red when the Gondorian swordsglistened high with the same colourReaping heads through the enemy hordesShowing their mastery and their undisputed valourThe sun was mirroring the Lady’s ragewhen she rode towards the fanged monsterwith fierce eyes going on the rampageand lo! With a mighty blow she beheaded the creatureThe enemy host swayed at her victorious cryand like a sail which flaps like a flag once its bounds end up to untieit disbanded running away like a scared ragtagwhile the sun was sinking red into the western seablessing with her last rays the free people victory.Having composed the song, looked for his companions to show them his new work and he found them debating where to go once they would leave the village of Stanshelf.He listened carefully to their different opinions and proposals, then he chimed in after ' remark.""It seems we don't lack important errands, my friends.""Then he paused smiling at his companions and nodding his approval.“However, I need to remind you that we were on a mission for the King and Queen of Rohan, thus, before we embark upon a new enterprise, we had better conclude this one reporting its  result to Their Majesties.

She cannot say if it is an illusion she had glimpsed or simply the effects of stress layered upon physical trauma but she doesn't much care for the implications either way.""Poor fellow,"" the young woman observes once Alexi points out the woefully misplaced body, almost glad for the grisly distraction. She has seen her share of dead bodies during her time with the Flaming Fist—murders and accidents and so on within Baldur's Gate's numerous districts—but it isn't something she had ever grown complacent over. Much as the other guards seemed to embrace detachment, Mieke has never been able to ignore the idea that this fragile, ruptured, and neglected vessel had been a living being with thoughts and dreams and loves and fears not so long before. ""Perhaps the Burgomaster can tell us if he had family,"" she suggests in a subdued tone after perusing the letter.

I am not ungrateful for the loan but if the cost is weathering abuse, then please take them back.""She meets the inventor's gaze levelly as she speaks and she's never been much good at masking her emotions so the hurt in her own honey-colored eyes is fairly plain. It may be safe to surmise that the Sembian is overreacting but she's still a young woman far from home for the first time and cut off from any friends or family she ever valued. This state doesn't appear likely to change in the near future and the newest pressures can't possibly be improving her severe outlook. Self-doubt is the only thing she has in great abundance, aside from resolve, and since waking up near the gray and muddy road one is steadily pulling ahead of the other. More than anything else, despite her physical prowess, she really seems like someone who doesn't want to feel alone.""I cannot tell if you two can sense it but I believe we have wandered into a very bad place,"" Mieke explains carefully. ""We may well be in over our heads here. And we need to be able to count on each other if we are to survive. Respect is key."" She purses her lips in a prim, pensive expression before continuing.

It's a curious sensation, as of hot wax dripped from a candle along her open wound, but not in an especially unpleasant manner. That psychosomatic heat dims quickly to a more soothing sensation, almost like gentle fingertips curiously teasing her torn flesh.

Insight @23,">Qanhaz rubs at his temples. Amarla’s reveals of the assassin and Farid’s occult gloom are ruffling him. “Someone gave it away to me! No?
