the role that boots has had a change of

a change of heart and boots is now a

bard of sorts yes College of swords bard

so mm-hmm

boots boots the blade yeah this whole

time hey when did you go to college just

in between we had lunch and he was like

yeah it's a the College of swords is

basically what he wanted to be the whole

time but he just didn't know it existed

so he's been trying to wrestle these

other classes into some kind of homebrew

and then the the custom class he was

playing was essentially just ripping off

a bunch of Battlemaster stuff we have a

battle master and he's like this is

actually what I wanted to be and I was

like yeah go ahead and change it like I

consider I'm on the record of saying

that your character sheet is an

imperfect translation of your idea for

your character into the rules and so

it's not unusual for a player to be like

oh this isn't I don't change my

character I want to change my character

sheet yeah so this is actually in a lot

of ways it's extremely similar to some

of the stuff that I had done by cobbling

together homebrews and various things so

shout out to David bags on Twitter who

helped me who you know was like hey

check out sword boards and so I did

sword yeah I play I expect any scene

[Music]

what kind of bird are you actually your

swords is a bomb can write Slim's story

Slim's every deserves to be written when

last we left our heroes you folks were

about to assault the temple of anti

sanity within which are a bunch of

insane dorms also known as Darrow and I

think we said we were just gonna pick it

up here and roll initiative and I have

chanced very slightly changed the

dimensions of the building mmm to give

my guys more cover last time because I

kind of just it's only a symmetrical on

his side well okay yeah [ __ ] you dance

on the cymbal all right yes go ahead it

will start the battle with you casting

fire make for those of you who wanna

know the behind the scenes straight dope

on what's happening tonight we have a

patreon and people 5 or $10 tears get

access to my adventure notes which are

now basically complete I think and when

these folks are finished with this

adventure which may happen tonight that

would surprise me but when they're down

at the adventure I will post a no it's

for everybody so if you're like I don't

want to give you patreon money screw

that that's fine I just wait until these

people are done and they can read all

the juicy behind-the-scenes nonsense and

find out all the stuff they skipped and

all the stuff that I had to make up and

change because I don't have no idea what

I'm doing

one makes it two fails three bales blow

on those that's why I didn't and so yeah

let's say I've got a laser pointer so

this dude makes it and this student

makes it and that guy fails in that guy

fails so this is

one two three four mm-hmm

so who deep black talonflame from night

saloon yes it's a slave master no God's

no masters I'm sorry how much damage 48

Wow so two and three failed and the

other guys made it so they take 24 mm-hm

and associative I have already finished

affirmed on my guys because I am trying

to be responsible trying to be

responsible when you've got a result

just call it out we'll see what happens

1818 or slim yes

showoff Oh 414 where's yes hired

where's keys over here yes hired

dexamethasone each has hired ex judge or

judge so yeah judge is also plank eight

eight I'm gonna use my lieutenant

ability to swap us so ya know he now has

been made field commander aka lieutenant

by King be commander and so he's sort of

in charge of like tactics and strategy

take care of that gun I don't wanna know

what happens when they ring it yeah so

yeah the dwarves are on fire

[Music]

it burns holy fire consumes us well

nobody's just still there dancing yeah

dancing a jig let's see Liam King or 14

yeah

oops wait they're not there yet that's a

dead mutant annyeong

no no no show me oh yeah you got the

judge Hannah for until boots switched it

and then and then okay oh you guys can't

see these cards yet because I haven't

acted yet judge so yeah you just watch

Kings eyes flash with sunlight and small

marble of fire emits from his finger

sails into the room different detonates

in a fireball and the Darrow are now

burning narrative lis burning it doesn't

have a lasting effect yeah so so yeah

line of sight to the gong yep

and so from here it's 125th range

awesome you're well with alright yeah so

he's gonna go ahead and use his action

to silence it's no dogs allowed from

Snoopy I think of the Thanksgiving oh

yes yeah that means it's it's a it's an

intersection and then four squares out

in that a circle yes I go there halls

the entire thing it's five where is the

intersection that towards the center yes

if it's right here then then in that

case there would be further out it's

like it's like

eight by eight basically if it's 40 feet

across

Wow so hang on it's not an 8x8 square

though you're right hey by eight it's a

circle so it would need to be kind of

towards the back wall to get the Gong in

it yes I wanna do it somewhere around

your overlay templates

so it's super useful to have them not

where I need them here right so that's

it okay so let's get to me I'm gonna get

AG who's that guy at the bottom they

anything this guy is uh this is this guy

sound like a silly question but what are

the effects of silence silence for the

duration of ten minutes

concentrate yes haha so the duration no

sound can be created within or pass

through this 20-foot radius sphere

centered on point you choose within

range any creature or object entirely

inside the sphere is immune to thunder

damage and creatures are deafened while

entirely inside it casts a spell that

includes a verbal component is

impossible there got it

that was judge at slim me you guys judge

casts yeah take at least forty minutes

Ilana okay

you don't put a thing underneath him to

mark you as a seal on we should have up

we should have a lot of those and it

should have magnetized basis oh I have

no way yes

slim while Anna's finishing her sir yes

when did you put the seal on it's the

one yeah that guy all right these are

dwarves from a Kickstarter I've back

5 that's a save right yeah yeah that's a

16 plus 8 all right I'm sorry you want

to mark this cuz I think this is gonna

use the spell again so yeah he he tries

to he tries to abjure you I'm sure yeah

he tries to observe you and you feel

this this barrier this interdiction

between you and him is preventing

somebody's somebody some extra play no

powers perfectly happy with you where

you are and so this Darrow is esteros

not to my home so that was the Darrow

priest it's leech okay let's move me

into somewhere useful so I want to be a

little bit out there I've always

considered you a little bit out thank

you sir yeah guys cuz I want to show

this everything on this island looks

like it's me

out of ya floral or clamshell building

this building looks like it's made out

of marble it's kind of out of place

how tall is this the ceiling in the rug

30 feet every day um six squares okay

unless I forgotten if you like bunched

bunched up well it was too many of you

on one thank you three come on yeah

knock a guy over a bit I'm like sitting

in the middle seat over the back part in

the back seat a little squished Larry's

like get away from me I already have to

sit in a small room with her all day can

we swap Odie yang squeeze you like

Yuri's so you know what I'm gonna just

fire - I see it's to agonizing blasts

that wanker we're number two I think

right okay let's just do two at the same

time so well that one's probably missed

it does that nine is this armored

closure try it yeah you give me are you

missed this one is 16 16 misses these

guys were heavily armored I know I have

failed miserably slim you know you are

you're only fifth level so maybe when

you level now you have learned that

lesson and you won't do it again yes yes

your watch leach ineffectively was a

spray some of his holy new polymer and

it's it's everything except the thing is

aiming for yeah that sounds about really

[Laughter]

[Music]

so I took the Internet's advice and got

a total of the band all of the dead for

my Cantor it does take sound schooling I

don't know what it does so you point at

one creature you can see within range

and the sound of a Dolores Bell fills

the air around it for a moment the

target must succeed on a wisdom saving

thrower take one d8 necrotic damage if

the target is missing any of the tip

points

that takes one d12 my product damage the

spells damage increases by one die when

you reach fifth level and then that so

on what happens if he makes this a

[Music]

alright it's anything else it's a catch

up to so DeLorean horses belt so don't

be sitting it's my grandmother was named

Dolores it's not my word its yeah you're

all the toy so that guy's not even in

the thing yeah okay

actually he can do it from here Josh

what another Christmas a make a int save

[ __ ] int you win some he's the Darrow

chance in his the the wizard he doesn't

speaks of spell in his insane language

and the words caused you pain the the

insanity of them to president like st.

it was crazy [ __ ] man and it's like it's

crazy all right you take six seven eight

nine ten eleven you take thirteen points

of damage and you have to clear your

mind otherwise the memory now the memory

of what this thing said will continue to

affect you you can clear your mind in

one of three ways you can either choose

to become dazed for a turn which will

give me you can either move our attack

but not both on your next action or you

can just volunteer to take ten damage to

pound until you save which could only be

ten damaged next round take 10 damage

save and you might make it be fine or

you can voluntarily end one spell you've

castles concentration

you just you just type that up right now

it's it's a it's a official DD thing

although from which addition it is

enviro under the tag wrote no no his

actual official canonical being a

nonsense just not from this decision

yeah six

yeah thirteen damage so you could be

dazed okay so on your next turn you guys

dazed is something that isn't in fifth

edition by the way so if you see people

in chat or in the you tell me it's just

going insane with my terrible dungeon

mastering it's from fourth edition and I

quite like it so unwelcome time I'm

busting I'm busting it out right now

like that or on him so that was the

always art it's a copper bit I know

everyone awesome

do eat 2600 yeah use my new bone bow

with that one

so that's 27 to hit I think I just heard

yeah Terry tackling bone bone it is plus

1 ya plus one to hit and it's magic it's

the boom boo-boom is so and yeah yeah

plus 6 is it plus 5 so 10 damage - which

one - - yeah again with my bone though

or what is it jeez 31 yeah you know just

missed well he ate a fireball and then a

couple yes wait plus an you did how much

damage

21 that last one was 12 12 plus 10 yeah

okay cool happened anything else

I'll move big head up a little bit yeah

go big cat wait big cat knows the path

to glory get up in there

I stay back but they can't you get up

yeah big cat will do yeah he's happy to

get into the battle uh it's boots boots

some boots newly barded who is he's

always been apart yeah but he's only now

apart he's only now always been apart

I'm graduating graduate from college in

the toilets big brains on boot the nosy

look at the big brain huh I am gonna

attack number one what do times oh there

he is number one will see 12 does not

hit anything

No so does a 19 yes all right yes they

are a c-17 is 15 damaged him this is

number one

sorry 12 damage 10 there's number one

number one number one got it uh and uh

what is what is dazed do its you either

you can either move or act but not both

gotcha

uh I actually have no idea really why

days doesn't in this edition it seems

there is it I don't know I'm not that I

can think of all right I don't mind it

to be a very useful kind of way to

negatively affect a player without

completely making them useless judge

don't let him get in your head

Bartek inspiration no it's a d8 it is so

nice uh uh do you know how this works

should i how does it work if it wasn't

at all undressed off the refreshers

within the next ten minutes uh wait

alejandra was bored yeah really bored

that's cool all right

within the next 10 minutes you can roll

that die and add the number roll to one

ability check attack roll or saving

throw but you must decide to roll it

before you know what the outcome of your

d20 roll is okay and then once you roll

it it's gone

and you can we have whatever time they

go

anas ryokan bard led an army of insane

dwarves on an assault against assault

against a KOA TOA

the fish man that attacked man I believe

got them all no no that's just a

strategist oh my precious little

followers were there they were tear

tongs or Rodriguez are where is drinka

yeah anyway

good times for me at least uh does that

Boots's boots done that is booths okay

so now the guards go so these guys have

Hal birds and they must have some [ __ ]

oh just imagine any reaction whenever

like the fire ball went off in his

recruitment if they're all crazy

so this dude number one he as a result

of seeing his from a being lit on fire

and cease seeing his friend eviscerated

he sort of has a psychotic break and he

just starts lashing out madly with his

halberd in in like in every direction

anyhow birds all for you guys marlis he

attacks you will see so boots

a c15 big cat a c22 judge now

and slim yes 18 plus 7 is 25 so I

believe it's big cat and slim can you

roll one more time for a display is a

key role more time oh I forgot yep yep

17 plus 7 is 21 so this is mini dice

[Music]

yeah well how many nights then did he

say he's using this isn't Albert what's

that

it's a polearm so it's like a long spear

with a big huge like X plate at the end

of so it's got reach it's got 10 feet to

reach and normally they can just attack

one person with it but they could have

somebody in the back rank but he's you

just watched him kind his mind break and

just starts lashing out at all Jenny

went mad himself of mad yeah and

actually he also has strength of

insanity which gives him he can once

burn down her he can he can buff his

attacks by 86 no I know these guys are

these guys are these guys are yeah I'm

Stein out madness wrapped in insanity so

it's seven eight nine stand by

nine where's the damage on this thing

there is nine 12 11 11 boards damage I

mean - did you rule I roll three dice

across just all of us or yes yeah and

then this guy this guy there's no reason

and this guy are gonna same thing to you

for oh wow so boots nope

big cat is big has still displaced yeah

oh no no actually yes okay let me see it

doesn't matter even if I added those two

rules together they would not you judge

no 17 head sees no slim 16 plus 7 hits

so

now judge & slims both 16 points of

damage from halberd slashing at you

you're still an injured or a Bic I

didn't get it oh okay and then the other

guy does the same thing big cat gets hit

this time you can get three more

ferocity boots

it gets critically missed you Hwang's

himself and he's so angry anything judge

a seven and seven is fourteen I'm sure

that mrs. and slim six and seven

thirteen I'm sure that mrs. so this time

only big cap in addition to your three

ferocity you get six seven eight nine

ten eleven twelve points amateur and

that are the Darrow guards it's now

judge you're dazed but you're only dazed

for this time yeah so you said that I

have to move right you can move or act

but you cannot do it okay and that

includes bonus action it's not right no

you can also take a bonus action I can't

take about okay so what I'm gonna do I

can move and take a bonus action I can

take a bonus action but you cannot move

acting taking apart a section alright so

in that case now these guys are using

what does a reach right which means yeah

if I may have ten feet or each and you

we're out of their range that I'm

they're both yeah we need some kind of

like in fact we need concentration

flying or something like is it consi

yeah it's ten or half the damage

whichever is lower higher which are

ready

Trevor's higher waiting yeah whichever

is higher yeah Jerry soon yeah but is it

a safe or is it just a shot that's a

concept it's a con 16 yeah you're fine

okay who is it guess my own self like

what's the what's the amount amount the

amount is

10 the DC's either ten half the damage

you took whichever is greater and so

it's usually gonna be it's usually gonna

be ten until things start to get really

bad yeah okay cool Errol de Tim and I'm

a plus six but actually no at this level

it's off to me now that I think about a

list of times we've concentrations like

first to fifth level but this is we've

not only were restored to the campaign

at this high level before it so yep so

so this this line right here is not

considered a space right we're just

gonna do that like part of this together

it's like a half square yeah that's fine

yeah so here I'm still in Custer

if you move straight you're still in

range of although they all three

remaining guards seem to have recovered

some of their they've shaken off some of

their psychosis so they're no longer the

product we will do that thing again okay

yeah in that case right there I speak

going on it yeah I think since I'm still

within range everybody I don't drag

um and I'm gonna go ahead and cast

horizontal you haven't left anybody's

yeah areas I'm gonna go ahead and put a

few on number three and I think that's

it Richard that was judge its limit all

right I got a dude me let's let's move

to the other side yeah so I get

advantage on that you do that you're

gonna get these two guys when you when

you leave their air yep you're gonna

leave their a threatened area because

they ever

just leave me there then all right I

will take my two attacks so I got a 17

and a 26-7 they both hit they see what

you're attacking the guards the other a

c-17 that one that's right next to me

number three okay so let's see here I

can re-roll ones and twos I believe go

ahead and add your he number three yeah

no three of the seal on it that I'm

gonna consume so go ahead and add two t6

onto that Wow okay so okay so 16 damage

for the first attack is number three

mm-hmm oh all right it was the other one

that ate the five on the face okay I

guess it's not possible for me to close

distance yeah I know I'm just wondering

if I can oh yeah there's a space for me

to be here okay like well actually no

sorry oh sorry that's like one of the

things that could always move over here

yeah but if I well I guess I can move

through yeah okay yeah put me over there

all right I'm gonna do my action surge

where is that did you only use one

attack on that one guy on number three

well I rolled for two but yeah I guess

he uses other attack a second attack oh

well no look it has to be two attacks in

an action right I don't know if I can

break up my action

like that can to do what with what I

mean well because I have to to to sort

of split moving fires with rascal all

right

and I don't care top one guy and then

move and attack somebody else right and

I don't I don't think so it says

whenever you take the attack action you

get to attack yeah I don't think you can

assume that way all right that one's

pound make sense I'm sure chat will tell

me if I'm wrong but alright so I'm gonna

use my action surge that man I'm going

to take an attack action which will give

me two more attacks cat seems to think

that it's okay I know you can I know you

can move attack and move but I don't

think you can move attack move attack

and maybe you can talk about whatever

you roll he hadn't moved yet oh well

then that's yeah ayah tell us his first

movement yeah I don't see why not and

then I moved okay so I get my second

attack then sure okay yeah doesn't

matter all right well I have seen that

guys can do the same thing yeah yeah I

haven't used my action surge yet 7:18

want to is this guy that I'm attacking a

normal guard or is he that one of the

yeah more powerful dudes know that more

powerful dudes are there on this guy

okay does 13 damage so this is number

where are you number three no number

four

yeah god yep alright now I will use my

action surge and I'm going to do two

more two more attacks hell yeah act like

six attack how many texts no no I'm only

actually taken to oh okay this is this

is a one-time thing he gets to do we're

at it attack yeah okay

all right so 17 somebody hits its or

easy okay whoa are you familiar with the

help yeah you can help yeah 13 more

damage on that how much more 13 got it

still up it's not happy he's alive

alright bloodied if this were fourth

edition blast attack that's 25 hits I

[Music]

keep meaning to try another yeah slim

did you just chew through two guys yeah

[Laughter]

and then you slip i slim to hell i don't

you skewered drawn here yeah I imagine

based on my understanding of the gift

that there's like your fighting style is

very fluid and balletic like even though

you've got this huge [ __ ] off great

sword it doesn't seem like it weighs

that much based on the way you swinging

around instead this kind of alien

fighter well the other I mean there are

marshal society yeah and plus they have

these weird proportions right there

these tall long and lanky you can't yeah

nope yeah I'm done meat that's why I was

trying tell everybody I know why shots

like no you can't do that no like yes

you can sorry what did you say that you

can't you can't you can't he can't

okay attack moving it up okay I knew you

could move attack a move I didn't know

you could attack the window that was

slim its know that you dude sorry if we

get if we go another guest they should

play it Jim yeah Jim yes linen Jim

yeah Slim Jim some Jim Joe all these

spells are all on like I don't think my

house is gonna make it you've gotta

charge are you serious we've only been

playing for 40 minutes and use no no no

I mean it's it's it's I've still got a

lot of charge I don't think it's gonna

make it all right well we've done look

yeah we got your Apple little we're good

for now don't worry about the action

economy here is gonna slow him yes

do me a favor and make a wisdom saving

from okay - you see a flaming crab an

iron crown of heroes limbs head and his

eyes sort of glaze over and he looks at

judge as though he's gonna attack judge

on his next action no I think that's you

know you act on when you're madly

crowned while slim is charmed in this

way a twisted round of jacquard jagged

iron appears over his head and a madness

glows in his eyes

slim must use his action before moving

on each of his turns to make a melee

attack against judge slim connect

normally on his turn if the priest

chooses no creature or if none are

within range okay great on your

subsequent turns you must use your

action to make it okay this guy

yeah it's gonna try to pilot you right

he's gonna give her you around boo cast

that's what know that one that one leach

can I see him as she from there oh no

the Oh Bella was I can't - maybe if I

move to whom he casts the spell he moved

perfectly legal he's trying to get out

of range of you lose guys trying to

shoot him from outside I'm sorry I

didn't realize that stays on but you've

done that do you like yeah there's

there's actually like a gif of you like

yeah and then well is there another one

over here right with three down now six

who's gonna have to come into the room

well not wonder if I could hit that guy

back this bottle did come over here

probably but that's the main issue

destiny right my fingers are pointing

towards him and you know I can't stand

next to me after Katie Sergent hands

soft sir so I've moved and I think I've

got line of sight with that get at the

back who's just keeping out of it ends

up to no good

that seems like it yeah yeah so no it's

a kindred spirit I will give him another

you're in Brit talking with agonizing

blast will SATs 815

ac15 yeah or though yeah you hit okay

and that yes no I into twelve damage

come on ice and there's have to do

anything he doesn't have to make a

saving throw over which I found that's

annoying it's not because he's right

yeah I know fifteen again and hits again

I'm sorry how much damage was the first

time 15:15 damage right no I'm sorry

sorry sorry sorry wrong dice

eight sorry eight damage on the first

one got it okay and then six seven eight

nine on the second one got it thank you

- two of his celestial blasts come

flying out of his fingertips in the arc

across the room and they splash over

this guy and they corrode away is this

evil flesh can I can I tell our day to

fly up into the sky and just fuzz around

rather than being stand on this there

perhaps he'll fly around can you know

that you just like I think if I wanted

to attack his one of my no it's not cool

view right yeah does he have any like

nifty ability that was legions king all

right so go ahead make an attack against

that Daryl hey that's my bonus that King

is using his commander ability as a

commander of the chain to give somebody

else that is a 16 plus 8 which is 24 yes

a good melee fighter who can do a lot of

damage a free attack that is 10 damage

10 damage to number 4 weight number what

number one god it's still alive he's not

happy when cast spiritual weapon so your

gillette red sword right there Oh sort

of red appears yes 14 plus 7 is a hit -

oh he's gonna have to make a

constitution say uh and it's a d8 go

ahead and use some shiny dice from Jess

mmm giant and that would be 3 plus or I

believe it's 7

yeah let me just double-check

yeah yes yes still concentrating mm-hmm

so he has some hit points what does that

learn number the spiritual weapon oh and

you did say I know seven dammit that's

better flick that guy up Brahmin beat

smoting

ha ha class the only doorway so ya

cuddles are one he's wet of it is it get

in the back

I need everybody except copper I guess

every said copper no d-o-d well actually

he's give us a go around corners I don't

know if it goes around corners I would

say that he would have advantage on the

same without bothering to look up the

rule because I can't be arsed I would

say you would have advantage on the

saving throw so everybody make a charity

save I did everybody except copper

I'm gonna use my bread against my dice

Matt's been fiddling with my dice

[Music]

fifteen minute fifteen as well I do not

make it with a whopping cetera well okay

so you to take half of it rest of you

take all these fireballs or five six

seven eight eight more ferocity dice we

need are you I want more cooler stuff

for for big cat three will do with

ferocity nice so that's judge oh yeah

would you do me a favor

oh yeah would you make a constitution

save against DC 15 yeah no you don't

have inspiration die

yeah

I don't I don't make it suddenly yeah

you can hear that wait wait what is it

it's ten right know again it's ten the

damage to whichever is higher and yeah

it's 15 in this instance make it so yeah

suddenly you can hear the water is

splashing and as though the damage Thank

You Chet or Jerry what is your role

I roll ten right old for then I added

six are you it by resistance so I take

seven names correct so you take half of

what you saved so half of you take out

for fifteen yes which is we were drowned

up right I guess so it's eight so that

means you're deep the DC is for that's

crazy n is like I said worth over sire

right yeah that's why I knew I knew it

was like super rare that I was ever

gonna be more than what is magic

resistance doing yeah you get the role -

you do you have advantage on savings but

I'm still gonna fail you say fifteen

damage until thirty okay so I get

fifteen back that's right he'll remember

me well yeah

god I'm like we're just like awful are

you from hell are you from Alec uh and

that's definitely from help okay his

family's from Hell for sure a family

from hell I really I really want to get

rid of the silence about unfortunately

it's not opportunities past cover okay

okay you get rid of this [ __ ] clown

the Med this one is a dollar I'm gonna

be this one's been here shopping you

should have moved away from me George

hungry no nineteen should join the

derrick get ready

eight damage eight damage to that guy

with of just a regular everyday arrow

yep and then wait nine damage you said

eight actually fourteen do I hit wait

wait wait wait wait wait you're

attacking the priest no he's heavily

armored okay and then your concept bro

Oh cuz he took damage he's fine big cat

up for a multi attack so I'm talking

with some book and whatever it is

beastly ferocity yeah if I if I get my

[ __ ] together what I like to do is

either to go through the Monster Manual

and take all the like basilisks all the

stuff that's like big cat and say if you

get this as your pet you get these

abilities and make them kind of

customized if he's trying to make it

generic for anything you get it makes it

to kind of weasels especially they don't

come within a you know yeah come with

that yeah lady it's gonna be all kind of

quasi tedious work but the payoff is

they'll you have a bunch of dope effects

regardless of what type of monstrosity

what is what's the category of creature

is like an aberration or monstrosity or

some [ __ ]

large monstrosity monstrosity yeah

two thoughts

eighteen hits plus so that's not nine

because there's thirteen damage

thirteen and then one more attack

eight plus six go get them you can sorry

won't see the AC ones

well you're talking the priest or 14 I

think I miss 14 misses yeah doesn't say

as I see you know that we'll run it down

there Casey you hit him once at least

yep ac 16 okay is that 14 on the mate oh

it's 14 16 so don't cut the constant

strange uh you made one of them because

he hold the three concentrations over so

you're I knew it was some optimal based

on the order of operation but I don't

think that the arrow would have been

able to make that judgment

yeah I mean you got a I kind of there's

a difference between what I know and

what the bad guys know and I always try

to err on their side that was copper

it's boots all right I'm gonna say cat

just wrecked yeah you get some extra

tuna tonight yeah nice how are you two

doing now that your snapped out of your

trance I have less than half of my hip

points fireball all right no worry about

me vodka huh

all right can go ahead and cool me as I

as I'm out I'm gonna run towards this

guy but before I do touch you on your

shoulder pauldron and I say you'll be

right which is healing word Oh

so everybody this party is a better

healer than the Clark I'm feeling to

four plus four and you kill my mother 2d

for 2d four plus four oh wow yeah that's

a human was a bonus action so I'm gonna

come up here and try to stick this sword

all the way through this guy's head

you can read that that's where he keeps

the mice that run his brain 17 cranium

rats say 1713 it's 17 it's in so a 19

would also hit correct yeah ACS 1427

damage yeah

27 damaged yep is that oh really that

guy over there yeah uh-huh

he's just a wizard just normal sort I

rolled good wait I'm sorry

Gate goop alright what was your first

damage I was a respectable did you did

you did you did you give me both damages

or did you get torn up that was the

total of both damages and you didn't

tell me what okay you didn't give me the

first number and then give me the total

of it it just gave me one number and it

was both yes make sure just make sure

Marriott that's correct one plus one

plus five for a second there I thought

that you would basically done like okay

I do nine damage and nine more that's 18

and then I wrote down 27 so I was like

wait no yeah the guy's dead do you have

any more movement or action but you want

do you got more inspiration dice you can

hand out or whatever

I'll use my bonus action and let's see

that was I did I moved so I'll just kind

of I don't know let's square myself up

to throw a dagger at that guy I guess

okay it was boots it's judge Horner or

he's surrounded now he's he's done so um

so Dan who's gonna reach out and grab

him and try to do his infernal conduit

oh nice yeah I believe you will have to

make a constitution saving throw

it needs to be above 18 all right sorry

16 my good guy still alive so now he has

to make a signal

yeah for Constitution that needs to be

about the 16 he failed okay you all do

one so I need some helium so those boxes

are [ __ ] cool yeah yeah so I can do

up to 18 points of like Life Drain

intruments and you heal me but I don't

know if he has 18 HP left so I'm just

gonna [ __ ] he does you know

I'm gonna start draining and by the

point that he falls like collapses you

pick a number

really yep it's not a dial you turn and

well I can't possibly 16 points of HPV

doesn't have 16 to give you pick a

number how you tell me I can choose 18

I'll get it regardless if he's dead or

not it works like land okay then yeah I

will take 18

okay and then okay yep so yeah you drain

some of his life mmm and you heal that

much correct yes that's cool okay and

that's all I'm gonna do I'm I always

just feeling this dude that was judge it

slim me I don't know if you can get next

while there's a yeah okay I don't know

if my sword the spiritual mmm can ask

chat

I don't think spear for weapon takes up

a square it's like a floating sword so

uh just moving just moving within 30

feet in that chumpy

[Music]

just within 30 feet I don't like to be

right next to him and oh yeah I think

we'll silence I'm just gonna I'm just

gonna chuck a javelin oh oh well I think

like this is an actually person it's a

floating sword so I'm pretty sure you

can just attack him

oh really yep I have a feeling it's that

way too because I'll just have the

nobody said the ghostly the spectral

spirits or well it was that one yeah you

create a floating spectral weapon within

range the last with the duration it just

says it can make an attack when it's

within five feet of enemy we can look it

up later go ahead and add you can make

it just a serial blade or whatever okay

that's what it's supposed to does he

take whatever form like he said I'll do

some chip shop at source or tippity-top

1616 missus

that's fair a twelve damage for the

first attack twelve dommage seventeen

[Music]

I'm gonna use the superiority die

[Music]

so 17 damaged and I'm using the trip

attack got it

trip attack respective attack he has to

make a strength saving through against

15th any of you guys have made them I

have a whole thing they can do it no you

guys he roll what else we don't want him

to do the others yeah they've got this

cool thing because of their insanity

that they never get to you it's good you

guys are not indulging them alright no

actually you know what I am my own oh

I'll save it yeah that was slim it is

now this guy he is gonna use his last

four level spell I think what's gonna do

not wonder panic I should think yes it's

trapped in that corner hey what's he

gonna do well I mean he's insane what's

the thing so the question is one two

three bro can you not see you I'm in the

doorway didn't you cast a spell no I

came in a cast spiritual weapon yeah

step by oh and then you retreated yeah

one two three so I guess so Bobby's

gonna come through snakes can he

interesting so yeah I need my key down

big cat to make a charisma save oh my

god uh do you do that's a copper look I

like twitching and his his body is

pulsing and if that shape is changing

and morphing and he screams as his arm

ripples and splits into a giant tentacle

and he attaches ooh giant tentacle yeah

so now he has a pentacle for an arm okay

I just believe

you can make it used to be you could

make a roll and if you succeed on your

own you believed it wasn't there even if

it was a I hit you are grappled you

don't take any damage right now but

you're restrained blinded and you're at

risk of suffocation so he hits you with

this tentacle and it wraps around you

of my choice that I can see within range

right I would choose to see you a

creature a creature you can see why

what's the context for this are you

trying to inspire yourself I'm just

gonna like like not like what's the

ability you're trying to use healing

word healing word yeah you can healing

wounds like yeah that's I'm gonna be

okay I'm gonna say healing things to

myself oh I would if I were you I would

choose to see myself all right so that's

eight yes what if I would damage the

camera yes please you would blind all

your viewers to get one of those like

ten TV you can get I was looking for

these I gave up and I'm like I'll just

get the ones they're like 80 cents or

whatever but you it's gonna Amazon

you're like a laser pointer hammer

sounds like we got you covered

he said it doesn't cost much you spent

like 17 bucks and you get a laser

pointer a little like burn through this

stuff like this bright beam green laser

I've seen those it's amazing and they

show you on Amazon like a match on fire

I'm super still though they know if they

very kosher yeah I get to keep the beam

steady yeah yeah I cast a cast healing

word and a third-level to actually kind

of a little bit yeah well do Bart's get

spells it first of all I'm a six level

board of the most I'm just not used to

bards being effective

[Music]

[Music]

actually like mine d12 [ __ ] up so okay

so Josh good it's gonna right over here

[Music]

mutant Darrow actually how are you still

belly hurt oh definitely far less badly

no rebuff 10 yeah so yeah I'm gonna go

ahead and do my there any great weapons

probably like a Halpert or something

I'll burn yeah I don't think it's

actually a 14-4 cheated there is AC 14

alright so then I do 7 plus 5 a 12

damage on the first attack right again

12 damage then I do 6 just by which is

11 damage so total of 23 image got it

yeah it's you're you're using a great

sword right adamantium life the

adamantium one yeah you're hacking into

a minutes you're great sword is you know

connecting and doing what and we're

normally do but this thing just ignores

it that doesn't literally nort but it's

just so like crazy and it's its body is

shifting and morphing and mutating as

you as you watch it that it's just got

this insane health I'm gonna go ahead

and use a bonus section up on him yes

Elam that was judge it slim okay let's

see here this is one of the most

effective initiative trackers I have

ever used because we used to we had one

this was the poll with with clothespins

I mean like but it was in the middle of

the table so you still like a great it

was easy for me to ignore that's not in

the water isn't not know if that's on

the let's on the line on the jump I put

a hedge five foot up step

it's not really like a step step it's

bigger than I need to roll again holding

it up there it's a lot like an altar

actually it's not yes no you have to

really think no it's very hand to

consider that pool though so yeah became

a short attack I don't I don't have

advantage do I know if big cat had moved

five feet over you all right I was a

Miss giant that's a hit a game guys and

I'm gonna use a superior you die

seventeen damage and make a strength

saving through MB to fifteen or fall

down yeah

plants might be three okay you calm down

no no it's a d12 though he falls yeah

that's weird

yeah his limbs rive and twists it looks

like his other arm is about into

tentacles he is knocked prone which

basically I think gives advantage I'm

rollin advantage okay you're done I'm

done okay he stands up haha stupid boy

can you at least pretty happy where he

is no I wish stupid I should've done

something different um let's see who did

the most damage to him probably be

that's between charge and slim certainly

so one two or three or four five six one

two three four five judge which I see

John 16:13 plus eight is twenty one

fears me so you are you so his keys East

and he stands up and looks at you and

thrusts his be tentacled arm once once

an arm now a rippling masts

of sucker to tentacles and they wrap

around judge and those tentacles grow

tentacles until eventually there is

tentacles across your eyes and sneaking

into your ears and trying to worm their

way down your throat you are restrained

blinded and you are running out of it

and you get water anyone need a refill

oh I forgot to use my mug yeah I might

do that I might I might just you know

you're gonna enter the room welcome okay

I'm gonna OD attack ah don't want to and

so if he goes blue flying over s plus 5

- Oh bollocks ate that potion oh my that

push if you attack better next time oh D

I'll make give you a little man give me

my potion anyway uh I moved on it's a

good night

and then it's king yeah I'm gonna say

yeah hey wait wait you gonna go through

the walk he's flying sword oh I'm sorry

his consort I thought there was you

it's a floating spectral labrum big cast

floating spectral blade

that a six plus seven that's 13 years

fourteen Aesir correct so spectral sort

of exists a special sort has avenged no

well I rolled worse okay I point at him

you see fifteen was safe he felt unless

he's mean

fifteen damaged necrotic if that matters

got it you he's now reasonably wounded

he definitely seems to it like every

time you cut him from the wound blood

comes but also more tentacles startled

tiny little tentacles filament start

coming out of his body that was King

it's copper and big cap okay I'll do

hunter's mark on them after one DC hmm

so Phil I don't see a designation unless

it has great in the name but like when

you look at the weapon properties great

is not one of these acts great sword

great mall is this uh is this your

fighting style he's wondering if you

news yes proper halbert's

twenty six hits for nine oh nine plus

ten eleven twelve damage sixteen does

the sixteen hit yeah yes okay AC 4412

damage twelve more damage like it's

heavy the designation for great and then

I look up under fighter fighting styles

under a great level rider will tell you

it's probably just two-handed I think

it's well just to reach weapons if

there's a reach weapon he can use with

his fighting style yeah and I think it's

just I said probably like a halberd and

I think and he's looking for weapons and

of the great property but I don't think

that's how it works I think it's too it

yeah wielding with you hands so yeah I

guarantee you there's a [ __ ]

two-headed witch well other yeah there's

there might not be a knock to a degree

from cool battery of 15% so let's have

the two-handed or personal property even

is benefit eglee only four hits for nine

and thirty damage that's big cat right

now with his multi attack thirteen

damage lance is special though because

if you're too close and then image

twenty-five it's 4:08 damage eight more

got it it's three more front and then

I'm done boots all right how's this guy

looking really bad awesome but it's hard

to tell because a lot of it like you

guys have done a lot fool a lot less

damage to creatures that are about as

big as this thing and wiped them out so

that this thing has this inner this

inner strength that is allowing him to

stay alive beyond all reason tough guy a

[Music]

toughy see here that case hinged again

Lance isn't two-handed either that's

weird yeah and if you're within 5 feet

its disadvantaged so it's kind of all

right well I'm still gonna take him to

why it's too bad so two plus it's in

that misses 19 plus eight is a lot more

than that and that it's correct correct

you and I'm going to make this a

defensive flourish so I can expand and

roll a Bartok inspiration die I add this

damage to my attack and to my AC until

it's our next turn Nick yeah that's what

I'm looking at Thanks so that's 15

damage and until the start of my next

turn my AC is

[Music]

Wow are you done no okay thank you

you're going to retreat I'm sorry you're

going to take MTAC opportunity yes are

you gonna roll an attack of opportunity

here I'm thinking about it can't do it

because you've got wrapped up oh he's

got two arms yeah I was a mutant it's a

guy who's about he's about to have two

tentacles yeah he's gonna go for it all

that all that I could just rolled that

was boots it's judge okay take damage

right yeah you take to do three thirteen

months ouch

so I think you did you make like a

strength or athletics trick or something

acrobatics doing a strength acrobatics

check or dexterity no I'm sorry a

strength act athletics check or a

dexterity acrobatics check nope looking

there I guess slim that's the folks of

behind MC yeah that's work tirelessly to

track all of our roles and everywhere oh

yeah big that's given me advantage yep

yeah good job big cat good kitty good

you disappear again all right does this

bear least often becomes their big yes

yeah doesn't disappear it is not yes

[Music]

you extra displaced my dice rolls are

just uh let's see here but your favorite

Vantage yeah I know you only need hit a

14 I know if this thing lives until it's

I still didn't hit okay yeah wait right

you to use your action try to escape

escape yeah it's 10 damage 10 damage

yes dead no yeah pretty awesome yeah

suffocate me to death

well no no that nothing nothing that

dramatic something we could anyway yeah

so it looks as though now all the bad

guys are dead

alright that's good this this room is

clean because we are pretty beat I want

to go over and check out the gong and

buy one mechanism mallet well I want to

see how it's connected like is it there

chains there's a there's a metal frame

and two chains a hanging from the two

chains as are gone and there's like a

little racket further gone mallet man

list somebody with some strength at all

they come over and help me like

dismantle this thing because like

silence is still up and I wanted like

try and basically take the going down so

that way somebody else can't come along

and try to ring out while we're gone Oh

a night strength so not only the

strongest but maybe slow to maybe

analyst I'm gonna take 10 minutes to

cast prayer of healing on everybody

except each well seeing you one two

three four five six but how can you have

any damage you mean you weren't in the

room in the big cats really beat us so

yeah it was something oddly your with

the fireball yeah

lot how are you're not hurt about it all

yeah okay yeah you can have bombs or

coppers dice about that thank you to d8

+ or no what do you say alright to d8 +

for like you know or everybody except

copy on a shitty roll I mean I guess

everybody control that's a go cheers

to do it I've decided to dismantle okay

you're able to here able to pull the

Gong off or there's a silence - what

yeah you're able to pull the gone off it

what kind foot I'm going to attendance

they spell this a charm in the middle of

it okay yeah right in that college you

don't know how does that work I think

Lee works if the spells of third level

or lower it works if it's if it's a

third level or lower yeah

it's not if they're level for each spell

of regional higher for each higher spell

sorry I dislike typos here for each

level for each spell a fourth level or

higher make an ability check using your

spell casting ability DC equals 10 plus

the spells level okay Jordan Merle

doesn't but not impossible

that's yes I mean the worst to give me

is 19 right 10 plus 9 19 is a 10% chance

will do without any bonus commander any

any words of encouragement guidance

Oh God 2:04

come on yeah I was I was guided well but

let me say what are your odds I mean

yeah let's see I haven't tried - sorry

guys I haven't really yeah try to do

that one in a while was a little

embarrassing you guys the boots and king

can sense the magic radiating from the

middle of the room from the symbol yep

there it is

writing on here any way that I can see

and understand no no nothing no similar

and this was with the statue wasn't in

here was it no statue is that spells

outside yeah and there's no doors in

this room great it was just this is this

the same kind of waters outside no no

this is uh

this crystal blue water that glows with

this kind of can we see through it

can you see through it yeah I mean in do

you mean like can you just put like

normal water can you look at him see you

go ahead and cast water we did you know

we use one scrolls oh you're right

because I pushed your head in the water

yeah oh really I thought you did we

threw you in and then I like you know

what we should probably do water

breathing yeah thanks I remember now I

last 24 hours so yeah you can look you

can are you know were you at the UH

you know look into the okay

I mean you it's it looks clearer but you

can't see the bottom I'm gonna I'm gonna

round to bleach OD the thing is it's

weird because the the the water is

glowing mm-hmm

it's casting its own light so looking

into it it's kind of hard to see my

sight OD OD fly to the water and just

taste a little taste all right mm-hmm I

wanted to go he'll fly over the water

and he'll like flying hovering over

he'll go

and maybe like look thank you why can't

one yacht knows there are tales of great

warriors who have ventured here into the

Lord of madness lair and they have come

back to tell stories that when they're

in there you are completely bound by his

rules sirs you know the rules are no sir

I'm only told that they're bound by the

rule the rules

idea slim yeah do you uh do you get your

spells back on foot rest all right I get

my inspiration back any help I I'll bust

out my 1/8 mandolin and start strumming

a nice restful tune so if anybody rolls

handling check oh well if you jump in

then yes big cat well eventually call

judge you find yourself you're you're

wet you're damp like it just jumped in a

bunch of water but you don't you instead

of being buoyed into this into neutral

buoyancy you land on your feet and you

appear to be in in a corridor it's five

feet wide and it goes down ten feet and

then turns to the left and the walls go

up to the ceiling and the walls and the

ceiling the floor are all made of the

same substance that the buildings out

here were made up not the coral but that

Club that mother-of-pearl right

substance right how tall are the

ceilings that's 10 feet tall are there

any like inscriptions or any like that

there's this dull white light that is

radiating out from the walls looking

around me does it seem like I'm

underwater

nope okay no you're just wet like you

just got out of the pool so you're

leaving a trail of liquid behind you

let's put there's water pooling at your

feet twice you need like water like

leading away like trash

wait this just judge here so I turn on

behind me do I see like a portal if I

look up do I see like where the door is

another the the corridor you're in goes

another ten feet down and then turns to

the left okay so I'm gonna quietly walk

to the end of the quarter and just take

kind of a peek around the corner he

appeared to be in a maze everybody else

shows up same kind of deal take you so

long which I said we jumped you didn't

okay you guys you guys all appear in

different you guys all appear in

different places in the space

uh-oh a note together well no you're

you're in the same room but it's just

these winding twisting corridors and as

you there's the walls are apart from

this shimmering glow to them and this

mother-of-pearl texture that Iridessa

zazz you look at it apart from there are

no doors there are no there's no writing

or inscription and as you explore this

maze you all kind of meet in the middle

coming out of these like these tiny

twisting corridors and in the middle is

a obelisk a three-sided obelisk and

stone color with three sides one of the

sides is blank the other two sides have

writing on them and they each have like

a box carved into the stone is a square

a square carved into the stone so two

sides of this obelisk of this

three-sided obelisk AB writing on them

this cool stuff and it makes it feel as

though yeah that the time that we spend

here is not is not wasted and people get

something out of it that makes me really

happy so what I made a mistake

I put the Go juice in with cold water

[Music]

card me I'm sorry I just bashed the

microphone pay no attention to the man

behind the curtains excuse me

all right so these are the actually oh

my god we're Campbell is living up to

your title he does have a card for it so

this is the maze someone's never done a

maze before clearly oh if you think that

master of Waikiki over there so this is

where the maze deposit ooh there's

writing on this side okay what does the

writing say like the whole needs is only

as big as these four these four tiles do

we like see over it nope well the walls

go from the floor to the ceiling

where's ID but you can if you took ten

minutes you'd be able to walk around it

explore it and be like oh this is it

yeah Bodi right there yes oh lucky we

just it would it would just circle back

around into this main room with the

obelisk okay I want to read this obelisk

mm-hmm

guys that's writing on this one side on

that side I can read about let you read

it I can read but I love you thank you

come trust me I can read I expect

totally read let's train your eyes I got

the staff so on that side of the obelisk

the words written read lifeless life's

perfect for my where can show a nose i

tongue or ear yet neither smell see

taste or hear all shapes and features i

can boast no flesh no bones no blood no

ghosts all color all colors without

paint but on and change like the

chameleon the mirror that's what it says

that does sound a bit like a mirror oh

well coming so marker read this other

side put me in spring idea next to me

well anyways is next to me you're

Italian me it's a bit tight guys gather

round

maybe you should be riding big that's a

good point on this side the words say

all things on earth I imitate a faster

the nature can create I mean sometimes

Imperial robes I wear a non in beggar's

rags appear a giant now and straight an

elf I'm everyone but near myself near

say I mourn never glad rejoice I move my

lips but want a voice I never was born

nor Eric and I then pretty tell me what

am I also mirror be you a mirror not

this side this side something else you

hear this sound like this like grinding

sound and actually King and copper and

OD can see

that there is the blank side has like a

secret compartment in it that's about 4

feet tall and 3 feet wide and it rotates

and there is a mirror oh you do a thing

where we can read what you just said

sure we just read do you want to read

out loud again or can I read it

sure can you come anyone see what's in

the secret compartment just yeah someone

there's no reflection oh okay

you want to just take a picture of it

mirror with my reflection mirrored no

question so I wonder if you to go

through it we'd see if you can step

through that mirror at all I could send

my him I would rather wait for yeah

let's let's have ot check this out sir

Odie you please if you please laughs fly

into the mirror oh D says pine and flies

into the mirror in Chi goes like that

and when it touches the mirror it

disappears oh can you do your thing read

through he's on the same please yeah

sure so right yeah I'll try and see

through his eyes right here yeah bottom

one what do you mean bottom one which

one could we go the mirror yeah what

this text is on the side that judges in

front of and that text is on the side

that puts us in fact I'm trying to see

through Audi's eyes okay

you see Odie appears to be on in a green

field with like there's a hill in front

of them and there's and there's a figure

on top of the hill there is a table with

what looks like a chessboard not just

what looks like a blank board with

pieces on it and a angelic figure

sitting at the table I presume you

describe these things to that yeah yeah

yeah I'll have Odie fly over towards the

bigger I could talk to him as well right

sure yeah so send Odie over towards the

bigger and a daily be different now and

closer like how you described it looks

kind of like your patron sitting it

sitting confused at this white blank

this blank board with these game pieces

[Music]

do I know what the game is do I

understand the game make a history check

hmm that's one eight I'll talk I'll talk

through Odie and it comes out as lychees

voice right I assume so I've come back

it's me leach looking through your imps

eyes the figure seated at the board on

top of this green hill does not respond

its yet you just said there were pieces

on the book

it's a blank whiteboard I have OD kind

of slide down and maybe knock one of the

pieces over he doesn't appear to like he

he his hand goes right through it ah

okay IDs scene illusion by the cell

where I'm seeing the illusion through

Odie's eyes right okay yeah-oh d fly

towards by patron it does and fly try

through him flies right through eyes are

okay they've seen an illusion can I get

oh D back to us is how would you do that

does he's like if he turns around as he

see a way back is there any port looks

like an in distance there are trees as

blue sky hmm I'll ask me he wants to

play a game who are you asking their

patron again no response no response no

we're not even as though as though he

can't even hear OD okay alright so we're

seeing an illusion well if anything you

can always pop it would be out of there

and then we summon him you need to get

him out there I mean I don't see any I

didn't see the point keeping him in

doesn't cease I can be sit well I think

leach is seeing the illusion right cuz

if my patron that Sunday I mean designed

to confuse me he looks like your patron

but is not is he's an angelic bigger

okay but I don't know if you've ever

actually seen your patron uh no I

probably know ok fair lose an angelic

figure but it's not as it could be your

patron but you don't know mm-hmm ok

[Music]

yeah I would I'll get him back name I

can just I think you can dispel the

spell actually I don't know how your

spell I don't know how fine familiar

words so there's no like square I doubt

it's concentration that would be weird

you just like a command like you just

give it a command to like just go away

and then I think it's a huge they might

yeah I might just be yeah you're just a

speller you just decide to dispel it

well no I think you're right buddy nice

I've been reading that it could be just

two for the same thing too you can look

it up while we did while we find out

what you guys think about the other yeah

yeah I don't know if it's actually a

second one it might actually just be

another the that might be too familiar

that duration is instantaneous so it

just it just happened and I guess you

just look at riddles oh if you yeah if

you want to get him back just cast the

spell yeah yeah all right oh just cast

the spell yeah I call I cast the spell

bring Odie back to its okay mark off the

spell can it be cast as a ritual okay I

mean I would have described it is a

ritual don't take you 10 minutes to ring

in back well but also I can take 10

minutes the castle's ritual then they

don't have to use when your spell slots

but because he's packed of the chain

master it might not even take a it's

just like a part of the chain if I'd not

even take a thing yeah the only thing I

can think of for the other side is that

I've ever liked larvae saying it's it's

part of the mirror brutal or it's a

separate riddle and we think it might be

a shadow but I'm not too sure because

the part that is a little all right

there where that's a little confusing to

me is like that it has lips but wants a

voice and this it says that it can wear

things and so while a shadow can kind of

show you but it's wearing I thought

those things we're a little bit weird

like a reflection well it only asks the

question on that one side is it right

which makes me think that they were both

oh it's the same okay yeah

they're not separate it's the same

riddle two sons like B ran out of room

on one sites they wrote the rest on

Heather

that's kind of what I think a moment

when we spoke the word mirror mm-hmm I

think yeah but only on one side right or

which I did the mirror if you're on the

third side there's the blank one mm-hmm

okay yeah something I think we kind of

solved it already okay and what about

the little squares that we're on the

other side like are those still there

okay how big is the mirror is it ornate

you or is it four feet tall it's about

three feet wide yeah it's it's it's like

a it's like an elaborate so you can

mirror you'd find in a in an expensive

nobles house I guess no bowls are too

expensive the expensive house of a noble

but if well guys I have a hunch I think

that because as you described what he

saw it seemed like it was tailored to

you I believe so sir I'm willing to bet

that as each of us steps through this

mirror we will see something different

so when our d step through and flee

around he saw no way back I had to bring

him back via ritual if you step through

sir all right not sure if you were be

able to return so easily yeah I

understand what if we like tie ourselves

together with rope and step through or

that way at least we'll be connected to

one another and we'll be in the same

physical place hopefully Oh even if we

might be an illusion is it order down

these hallways just eventually you get

to imagine imagine this maze just extend

it out to the edge of these four tiles

and then there were walls okay so

there's no way out in this room probably

you found so like the first the first

one I seems like a mirror but the second

one like I mean it's it's more specific

this is if the second one seems like

it's a mirror though as well it's like a

like a mirror doesn't imitate all things

on earth but the reflection in the

mirror

do that mm-hmm could it be that that was

somehow a reflection of some memory of

yours nothing I remember sir

very angelic figure but it's not a face

I could put a name to sir what happens

if I look into the mirror you know Sanok

does like the mirror why the mirror

reflects the walls mmm the rest of the

maze that doesn't reflect you can you

just stick your head in well don't you

just stick your head in I think if we do

that we should make sure to turn

ourselves do so so the first one doesn't

have a question at the end of it right

right it's only yeah it's not a riddle

it's just words then at that point the

last would ask for one thing yeah I mean

I want to say you're a reflection yeah I

think that's why the third sight well

the third oh you're a reflection that's

what you are I think it was we already

activated it and the me already showed

up and I wait to figure out what to do

in the mirror to get to the next part of

it well nobody reflects in it but a

mirror and find the mirror no idea knows

we're probably done with that longs for

a voice go in and play the game with

that celestial being probably we're

planned by the Lord of madnesses rules

now either way but bound by his rules

sir all right let's go let's go slim

walks in that walks into the up and

touches it slim disappears well it's

through after you said leaves my robe

sweet each other put an arm around judge

and be like come on and just take it in

there with

let's go judge booth disappear after you

said it's something I wish to again I

grabbed our D by the hand and go through

the mirror a lot is OD and leach

disappear who's left

just uh just being copper oh look a big

cat ago well you're on top of a big

garage

yeah I guess I I walk in you find you

all find yourselves in an idyllic scene

on the top of a small hill

blue skies cloud Sun in the distance

around you you see forests on the top of

the hill there is a diva a powerful

angel and he is like Rodin's thinker

staring at this blank white board with

nine little models of trees on it and

when you arrive key points to the board

and says this is the game of centuries

I must plant nine trees so that they lie

on ten straight roads there must be

three trees on each road I cannot I

cannot remember how to solve the game

it's it's driving me mad

oh well how rude he wouldn't swing - I

[Laughter]

loved the professor you get to plant

nine trees on ten roads yep ten straight

run straight lines using only ten

straight lines and which with each line

having three trees on it there is a

solution there may be one two three or

five six

oh but wait you can't move on why are

you doing they're set in or know you can

you can do they're just they're just

playing pieces on a board

yeah we draw the lines ourselves into my

place the trees where we want to correct

each line has to have three trees and

there have to be ten lines okay well as

it is now but I can connect to you Saul

try it yeah but those lines all have

more knowledge this seems to anger the

angel I started fool nerd lose game

where your trees are falling apart say

it may not be wise to anger him too much

they're like okay here I probably yeah

but don't worry

uh that's too clever this is all this is

happening in boots is mine it seems like

them you have an intersection at some

point yet so I've been trying you yeah I

just did it I've been across I'm okay on

the docks I'm here

I was thinking three so it's gotta be

ten lines ten roads and how many on each

line

hmm well if this angel guy can't figure

it out

yeah well GUI go means slump you figure

it out but I'm just gonna let you guys

think what you fix great viewing right

everyone doing a math test and wait you

said there's nine trees there are nine

trees that have to be placed on ten

straight roads there has to be three on

each grid line correct right Road all

right sorry 303 honey trout this is one

of those ones where like when you

finally figure it out you can I feel

like a complete yeah that you didn't see

it the lines have to be straight yeah

according to him he said straight line

trees so they lie on 10 straight roads

Leach has some distant memory of this

being a kind of a game but else

the real elves played that represented

the struggle between logic and save

three four five six oh I know

why do we do that 10 only 3 1 1 2 stand

by 7 8 9 madam work bollocks

yeah yeah the way it seemed yeah that's

it almost I'll go at it first

no don't work why not not work cuz its

attitude on the lines right that's one

line here two eight nine ten

mmm why couldn't this test involve

stabbing things so you set up a vague

memory of this yeah you have a vague

memory of the elves the real outs

playing a game without a real well

playing a game about roads our roads and

trees that represent it the struggle

between lawn chaos anything I can roll

to kind of have a bit of a memory jog

you can roll 10 roads into that's right

it's probably it looks like a train man

whatever the oh my god can the roads

have more than three trees on them uh no

yeah not according to the rules okay the

night chats figured this out the hey the

celestial huh uh once he gets up it

starts pacing around and gets up it's a

little more frustrated than angry

hmm figure it out um I will go to the

seer celestial and was it you that

answered me when I called do you have

the answer or not yet sir we're working

on it

we're working as fast as we can I won't

cool I taught me okay all right this

guy's only off the one thing getting his

ten lines yeah I know right

your trees on each you know actually do

I have I increase oh you do suck up

y'all force nine Monster Cards that if

needs must I can bust out

[Music]

oh yeah that's it

one two three okay one two three four

five six seven eight nine ten yeah and

they want to yeah we got it

well dry drawing it is the thing is they

look just like this is gonna be one

right one five now I've got it

no but if that hang on but if these

lines I know

touch that what does that count I don't

know I guess we could try it yeah you

draw it I can't reach from there but

here's the thing if that's a single line

and these have three on it five six this

26 it doesn't want seven eight not going

to shape trees but they could have a

line it says go three I'd snap the end

of my pencil it's only been five minutes

by the way feels like an eternity in

here I keep snapping my pen see

[Music]

this thing's are sure sharper to

probably I might be abusing it by using

it well I can get eight lines I got it

right yeah we'll see well see I will

change as if he's gonna pay up I hope so

dear my sleeve so far so good

yeah what starts drawing lines the daiva

the deeper walks up and watching 5 6 7 8

9 10 10 okeydoke uno dos tres on one

line Quattro now it's off giving up off

this eggs

yep yes bah and the daiva reaches Angus

that's it and disappears and you all

find yourselves in a hellish landscape I

guess I don't need the David card

because you have to fight ya took you

guys it took you guys about

it's 12:15 just do as it says no dude so

I I drew the same thing like 11 times

you know like oh this is different and

then I was like no this is the same

thing you guys I was gonna try to get

another hint like have you guys making

side tracks where makes it

and maybe give you the hint that it's

not necessarily a grid because I saw a

lot of you guys out drawing grids yeah

and I was like the solution is I mean

you could draw a grid where all of these

were on its client right and you'd have

to violate that yeah yeah someone had

triangle thing that's really dude

getting crazier I was like oh it's a

spoke you find yourself in a large stone

room the walls appear to be made of

brimstone

it smells like like judges home universe

and you see a fire giant pacing between

two huge to huge iron scales not just

one not just one scale there's one scale

over here on the side of the room and

there's another scale over here on this

side of the room on one scale has four

adult hellhounds and for adult

hellhounds and three pups on one side

and a stack of boulders on the other the

other scale has three adult hellhounds

and four pups and another stackable is

on the other side the giant drops a

couple of boulders onto the heap of

boulders on each scale and the two

scales balance

well the giant scratches his head and

then announces that the four pups Tufts

are the four hounds and three pups weigh

as much as 37 boulders

while the three hounds and four pups

weigh as much as 33 boulders it needs to

know in boulders how much each of the

hounds and pups way yeah God did you

write that down Anna so it's four for

hounds three pups 37 three hounds four

pups first one is 37 second one is 39 33

33 yeah there are two scales

each scale has one side boulders one

side pups and hounds and one scale has

33 boulders on one side three hounds and

four pups on the other the other scale

has 37 boulders on one side with four

hounds and three pups on the other and

he wants to know how much and he needs

to know yes I'm on trapped here what

what did he want to know what lies he

needs to know how much a how much each

pound and pup way oh yeah in boulders if

a boulder is a one unit yes let me go

take a nap on big cat big cat reacted to

hellhounds this guy is not there anymore

nor are those treatments dr. Duncan cow

go yeah yeah okay so get good luck math

guess that's easy the hellhounds weigh

seven and the pups weigh three oh how

could you

that's right it's a different can you've

studied well Kings a nobleman I had a

good nap over there so I just I do this

here works good it was your iron will no

all right so just like a seven I'm like

okay what would that make the pups okay

does that equal this yes okay I'm done

now see yeah there's like some clever

yeah formula no I just estimated and it

had the ring

no big brains I'm killed over that's

right you're a smart [ __ ]

not really all right everybody else I

think is negative you find yourself in a

well furnished opulent manor house like

you would find a Rio and noble lips in

your in the foyer there are doors there

are windows there are stairs that go up

to an upper level I think what's

happening here yeah yeah proceed proceed

mister I'm sorry describe the scene

again it's a house you're in a Nobles

house and it's dark in here it's not

well-lit it looks like it might be night

outside and there's it's a it's an

palatial mansion I'm curious if I

recognize this place I don't know I mean

it's definitely it's definitely

furnished in the ryeowon style it just

seems familiar it's not like it's been a

it's probably not a place you've been if

it is modeled off a real place it may

not be it doesn't appear to be a place

that you've been okay it's dark inside

it's it's like lit by dim candle light

but through the windows we can see that

it's dark outside the wind there doesn't

appear to be light coming in through the

windows I think there are some doors

yeah there is it's everything you would

expect to find in a in America there are

paintings of nobles on the walls there

are rugs on the floor there are

tapestries on some of the walls like all

out right cuz if this is some reason

else we should be the polite thing with

just to announce ourselves

I mean we're bound

yeah well whatever you and see when he

goes in doing this I myself in the

middle of the night yeah six of us

barging in we're here this is why I wore

my quiet boots your fruits you know oh

[Music]

dude it's not like they're not like

heeled boots were like a stacked heel on

them they're just like flat no bottom

web their foots like boots yes look

around Shelley is it upstairs there are

stairs up there are doors is there like

a front door behind us mm-hmm is there

anywhere to turn on lights turn on

lights light a candle there are there

are there are the candles in sconces on

the walls if flickered Emily I'm gonna

I'm gonna pick up a candle and I'm gonna

walk over to the door and crack it and

see if I can see the camera doesn't want

to come out from them okay um that's why

it on his dagger okay your dagger has

like I'm gonna crack open the door see

if it's anything outside door handle

doesn't want to open all right as a

reminder idea of Hell sight so if there

are any disguise hidden or invisible

creatures I do have an advantage on my

perception check to notice them

okay and I can't be surprised is there

any surprising is there trying to pull

out one of the candles the candle

doesn't even flicker in response to your

breath uh-huh I'm sure I walk through a

wall religion I walk up to a wall like

you bonking wall dang you just you guys

just watched coppers definitely possess

substantial it's there yeah the candles

there yeah but the light is well apart

from the front door how many other doors

downstairs just then outside there's

there's those corridors that lead off to

the west there are stairs up there's two

more doors

we walk upstairs subahu there are

several hallways and rooms up here

doorways more more paintings on the

walls

is there anything notable about the

paintings yeah I was gonna say I wanna

look at the paintings so slim and boots

both go up to a couple different

paintings and they're very clearly

paintings of nobles but as you get close

and inspect them the ink kind of they

turn into just blobs and when you're

standing there inspecting them you

realize how this isn't this isn't a

person this is just a bunch of a bunch

of random causing money

yeah but then if you walk away from it

or see it out of corn ERI it definitely

is a picture of us it's like if I do

that too or if judge does that like

other physical things and the house like

looks like really closely yeah like does

this like water effect kind of place

like there are so I mean like there's

like the candles and stuff like that so

they're like really close they're like a

candle or I guess if you go up to one of

the tapestries that are hanging from the

wall they there's no fabric

there's no thread it's just these

colored shapes on the wall but if you

were looking at them out of the corner

of your eye or if you're not expecting

them closely they look like they have

they're sewn detailed and doesn't seem

like you know if I put my hands up it's

like the walls and stuff they seem like

the walls are substantial like all

around I tried that in one room that was

like well done and then the other rooms

like maybe they're building material and

we just like slipped through or

something not everything you everything

you inspect in this place has that same

solidity but unreality the doors

upstairs nothing you can you can open

the doors upstairs okay

yeah and they lead to as you inspect

them they lead mostly to popul --nt

bedrooms and guest rooms as a master

huge master bedroom there's stuff like

closets as clothes hanging on the

hanging in the stored in the closets but

if you look at the clothes they're just

not yeah but they're just

this like cotton icon they're like

what's what I'm looking for

there are spun thread they don't have

any color to them whatever that outfit

looked like before you pick it up when

you inspect it closely it just looks

like twine like like like burlap I think

really hard about exit door opening

dozen about same pulse illusion

I thought copper had that sober you

couldn't be charmed uh it's different um

my name it's one you have to make a roll

but we're not making rolls advantage

against saving throws it gets spelled

out dis orange you confuse the loosen

eight train their maze anything in any

of these rooms

is there anything realizers and by yeah

there are there's um where are you are

you in the upper floor of the lower

cover your is it anybody exploring the

lower floor everybody upstairs I'm

looking around I love those yes I was

looking at the painting stone you guys

find a study about our lives are like a

library and there are books in here and

the books are all different sizes and

they have engraved spines and it almost

looks like when you're standing you know

eight feet or more away it almost looks

like you could make out the titles

mm-hmm but when you approach they just

smear and turn into they're still books

but they are they look like books but

the there's no real writing on the side

there's just this kind of like like

somebody took a paintbrush right there

I'm gonna reach out and kind of scratch

it all the books are real there there's

like no I know open it Bob you take okay

take a look how you're holding but all

the pages are like I'll tell you another

book quickly all the pages of like okay

where's the kitchen some dinner I'm

sorry I'm gonna draw something stand by

why what is the meaning of this it's a

painting a house it's like we're in a

dream or adding mm-hmm I was thinking so

how do you get out of what happens if I

touch one of the paintings it seems to

have the same texture as the rest of the

walls but Ziller walls there's not what

you would expect to find is like you

know oil and gas but that's not what you

touch wait this feels like you're

touching like this Wow smooth hmm yeah I

don't wanna go try opening doors

welp I mean downstairs is old me I do

[Music]

exactly I really sound sweet sold me

that any room of use we found downstairs

to study no there are lots of rooms in

fact as you're exploring you open a door

into another study and there are three

figures sitting around the table playing

cards oh yes out of the door

where's-where's day of them

this is downstairs yeah I think it's

three my guys there too then I'll do mr.

satti

narrow room an ancient study with the

books along the walls as a table sitting

in the middle and they are they appear

to be playing a card game well are these

full yes you know who these people are

yeah oh yeah each one I would yeah I

sees that that's not there so it's your

daily departed ex members of the chaîne

ex-commander to excavate scamander's was

the stab sorcerer

position here in the back of God around

like look at him doors I shouldn't we go

out yeah well how could we say no they

just gonna be a card game mm-hmm

be a game that you play in the D&D

universe but I've also got now obscure

actually your characters playing this

card game and I remember playing once a

million years ago its lavatory bro we've

like covering the covering the covering

this red slime yeah and when you enter

the room oh good when you enter yeah

well I mean those folks have gotten when

might I might

whispering giver or some [ __ ] like that

whatever those things like whisper all

the time right Oh gibbering Malthus I

don't think one's disguising themselves

it could be that there's like you know

obviously the Lord if madness could be

disguising all this it's like a VR thing

right well yeah

upon closer inspection it just kind of

falls apart um there's still some kind

of substantial thing underneath but it's

just like an illusion over that

yeah yeah if I inspect these guys real

close yeah what'd it look like

I mean they look like well you didn't

know you didn't know these guys but they

look like what you remember the slogans

office um I mean read definitely looks

much better than the last time I saw I'm

assuming what's the red slime oh yeah

because that's why I was thinking you'll

find out we're gonna find out your buddy

and eh it's gonna happen what a useless

comment I just made is there creepy old

dude painting on the wall like black

pudding or something like that like

what's the thing that you said they hate

on the ceilings and drop on you actually

might not be fighting long do we want to

bump Leach to the boy he's got the wine

needs a man oh I could always time to

drop he'll snap it right he is not as a

proxy in the back of the room oh god

there's this dark figure that yeah he's

made out of red meat yeah and you notice

that there is this sorry I was afraid I

was bumping into the camera for saying

that's cool oh it's cloudy right now no

in the dream in the dream logic of this

room in the dark of the back that's not

well lit you see this

pulsing gelatinous it's like jello like

form and they're these thin tendrils

reaching out from the creature in the

back from this mass of pulsing goo to

each of your three former friends he's

controlled in

yeah whatever it is look at maybe just

yeah so is this the right to juice put

yourself in or I'm gonna well I think

Jerry's coughing up a hairball yeah at

least Odie still got the wand at the

moment and I'm just gonna tell him just

to flap around up out of harm's way but

keep the wand

okay well it's boots turn and there are

the on the walls there's one here one

what the that strange red slime on the

walls suddenly turns around and you see

all these little eyeballs and mouths

open up whoa mimics gibbering mouth or

mmm actually the jibber-jabbering

actually it's pretty good for the

madness guy mm-hmm though they do

something if you hear them whispering I

think it is that like a discordant

whispers kind of thing uh-huh

maybe that's what we're saying cuz of

the whispers like community so that's

what you're gonna get the wall in next

to you appears to be coming alive with

eyeballs mouths

[Music]

sorry I'm gonna run up behind sweet here

and actually I'll yeah I'm to the side

of the table here when you get close

just when you get close to sweet you

smell like this sulfurous stench and I

can see a little tendril attached to him

right yes

can I try to attack either too tethered

or to that thing in the back with a

strand of slime can I try to break that

strand like I'd like to slice the strand

can you try to break this well I mean

you can spend action like try to grab it

and snap it or try to slice it with your

I'm gonna try to slice through it okay

with my sword all right your sword just

kind of catches on this this tendril and

doesn't appear to cut cut into it it

doesn't seem to okay this does this

sweet gola reacting anyway I always know

like there's no reaction at all like

what slimy tether is immune to damage I

see mmm what about the slimy creature

yeah okay because I really take that guy

out like these three will just be like I

mean I think that like sweet definitely

reacts like spins or like he spins

around and chastises here what are you

doing

mm-hmm so I commander you had something

in your hair with this

[Laughter]

the rest of my movement gets me here and

I'm gonna use my other attack to try and

hit this guy

when I get close to him it looks like

that okay so without that's that's likes

worse like yeah like it is extruded that

it's okay sweetie freaky yeah

unfortunately

all right that's uh it looks like that

oh hell yeah that's super cool

reaction I thought was pretty good don't

touch it

yeah strange ones yeah sorry sir

a bonus action oh well as a bonus action

I'm gonna give the commander in SPO day

any sun damage you can't use it on one

attack ability check or saving bro can I

see your cashing and you can use it in

between basically in between rolling of

rolling the check and figuring out if

that check worked or not like you you

basically have to you have to be the one

who makes the judgment call on whether

you're burning the diary so you slice

you slice into this thing and it Quivers

and all three and the quivering of this

large

the rest of you just see boots is kind

of in this dark it's not just the

well-lit shadowy part of the room

fighting something it's hard to make out

but you see all three of the figures you

know and call out stop stop him and what

you see this thing kind of quiver and

Shake and okay good step back here I'm

gonna cast a fireball here which would

be one two three four or she's hit those

a moment you can all clearly see this

giant news it's huge I think it's

actually larger than that many I think

it's three by three mm-hmm

and it's it's this is the first good

look those of you in the back of the

room have got and it's it's like 15 feet

tall and it's got skulls inside it and

funny did it it hit this same here yeah

we gotta get better art for if you stick

around we got your better art for

leisure

yeah real art sorry you know I remember

um I think I will blast giving mouthwash

I'll go for the thing in the back yeah

thank God thing in the back yeah yeah

fair enough

oh they're gonna they're gonna say don't

hurt me but yeah all right a gang of

agonizing blast 115 a night sticks can

use that m+ 622 yep AC 22 mm-hm which

one you attack you AC 16 with five eight

damage and then mercy

hates yeah the first one and then my

second tank is 17 oh yeah I did okay

coins in it and then six six got it is a

mother maldor oh it's the AI that runs

the Nostromo react any differently to

being cut to blast and I ignited my suit

well let's see there's gonna yeah no

yeah that was leech it's slim all right

I'm gonna rush the back of the room and

I want to be basically so I can have

advantage mm-hmm opposite over here yeah

opposite boots alright first attack 17

that hits 12 damage for the first attack

[Music]

11 and 7 is you turn it into it to 9

more damage got it you're hacking into

this gelatinous creature of large chunks

of booze are flying off video plot and

they land on the ground and quiver

before they die

trying to decide whether I use my action

surge yeah I'm gonna use my action

because when does that come back after a

short rest

yes next attack it's a hit that's 15

damage last one that's a hit we rolled

like two-four-six-eight dice good chance

yeah and I'm gonna I'm gonna try using a

superiority guy on this one just to see

it happen so I don't think it'll do

anything all right so that's more 13

damage and make a third while I don't

yeah I don't know if this will work I'm

using my menacing attack I don't know

what does on on a failure it is

frightened until the end of your next

turn so that's a DC 15 wisdom DC 15 whiz

save yep makes it is enough does not

appear to be afraid that's what it's not

happy you guys just did it in one round

you've done 102 boy sandwich I think

Phil I think Phil just did like most of

that I think he did like 70 damage or

something Jesus that is it for me it's

judge okay so judges gonna do basically

the same thing to try and like walk

through here at now I have a question

what are you walking across the table oh

you're playing an achromatic I came

across the tail sure

full cuz they pay gold on the side so

I'm gonna get an opportunity through he

can't that's a that's that's enemy yeah

it was Randy's oh this is the enemy here

no I thought that many like I had to go

up against the wall to go around him

basically but I was wondering Oh

and I walk past them how would you find

that they didn't attack me judge

that's true yeah if boots made over

there that you can yeah

I said make ever medics check well if

you want to leap over the table but I'm

not really worried didn't wanted to step

it up one two it I can't go around you

oh no I see yeah yeah I got I suit to me

now yeah right because if you go this

way you get hit by him no because the

table is an obstacle like like like you

can't just ignore it and walk through it

normally you have to either walk around

it or try to jump on top of it well you

you wouldn't take an opportunity attack

from going around the other side yeah I

think it like I said boots made it over

there you can yeah okay no no oh yeah

either side you're not gonna be within

reach I mean we don't have to okay you

know you can move through other I don't

know how boots got there I don't care

like boots got there without taking an

attacker opportunity judge get there I

didn't make boots make any rules as one

alright so yeah I'm gonna swing I'm with

my it's a good sort yeah all right so I

do 15 to all the 19 MCM stats oh thank

you I'm going to snap cards oh shoot I

should do this first hold on

Oh cuz how's it looking is it like like

pretty beat-up looking I mean it's still

a large pile of whose that's just

look great to me it's not unless unless

unless you've got like some expertise

diagnosing who's damaged that's not

going to be it's not it's like a person

where you can know how healthy or how

how damaged it might be doesn't occur to

have organs it doesn't have a face it

doesn't express emotions it doesn't go

out although seem imagine the other guys

the guys attached to it yeah every time

you would have every time you attack it

they freak out and they beg you to stop

roll 73 cents Lorch Wendy leach sorry

thank you let's go there's nothing else

around none can you only spend hit dice

on a short rest is that the only time

you can do it correct okay all right all

right

what did that solve what we did before

we wondered around some night that was

so that was the first door that was a

that was a that was one of the

downstairs like a study or a library or

something there's a outside mirror

there's an upstairs one like destroy all

the buses and then some happens

something it's not really a puzzle no I

mean not depend well we might all found

it we might not have found the puzzle so

maybe there is one but yeah there is a

on the lower level as you guys are

looking around there is

what appears to be like a solarium down

here which is like a like a kind of like

a small greenhouse and unlike the doors

there are doors in front of house our

doors on the back of house that do not

open and the windows if you look out

them you can't see it's just this fog

outside there's no features as you don't

see any ground or sky but the doors to

the there's a there's a blue glow coming

through the windows leading to the

solarium yeah it's good lights it's a

it's a very it's very similar to the

glow of the pool in the temple of anti

sanity interesting a warm glow it's warm

blue glow yeah I'm just gonna kind of

look up moth just kind of mindlessly

walk to this blue light there is inside

the solarium there is up like a natural

bath like it was built around some

natural stone formation where there's a

large pool of water actually about as

big as this room a large irregularly

shaped pool of water which is like the

large bathtub thing that you encountered

in the temple wherever that we're going

back back in that universe it is glowing

from below it's shedding light its

here's to be the water hot because

there's steam coming off of it and it's

this is like a noble's

natural bath like there's the walls are

nicely decorated it's a they're like

metal

what's so I'm looking for the whole

thing is glass all the walls are glass

and the veins holding up the structure

are this thin ornate metal and there is

a there is a on the on one side of the

pool there is a table like a parasol

over

and a couple of chairs and there are

there's tea and cakes oh set on the

table and there are two figures seated

at the table one of whom is rotting

corpse is dressed in a woman's fine

gown and like the body just died there

and the other figure is looks like it

could be a relative of the lawyer that

hired you obviously not in the best of

health but also wearing a Nobles outfit

it's a man and he's moving he's like

eating cakes and offering tea to the

corpse of the woman and he is wearing a

crown and we'll pick this up next week

because the crown I mean it is a crown

it's the only crown your phone yeah

that's true well there was one on if it

does appear if there were it does appear

to fit the description but it's like you

guys have photographic reference right I

did to us though yeah it does for the 10

minutes of took you guys a little bit of

a funhouse dungeon a little tiny bit of

a funhouse dungeon in the sense that the

players are the ones being challenged

not the characters these were three

different puzzles from a second edition

adventure

but I played through the player mmm so I

remember doing these puzzles but I was

playing as a computer science nerd with

a bunch of computer science and math and

physics marriage life and we ground

through the whole thing

at the time pretty quickly and it was a

lot of fun it's called the crypt of Lies

and read the mad and it's got like fifty

six of those puzzles in it Wow and you

know I think a lot of people

philosophically will talk about this in

the campaign dowry I think a lot of

people philosophically they imagine that

it you know challenges should challenge

your character sheet I'm a big believer

in challenging the player and being like

no you can't just you can't just make a

role to see if you can figure this out

you've got to actually figure it out and

I remember playing for the Crypt of Lies

Andrew the Madden even though it was all

like puzzles like if a train leaves the

station right even though it was that we

loved it it was a lot of fun because

there's a little change of pace and it

was kind of like this there were and I

imagine if we had kept if there were

lots of puzzles then it would have been

even more varied but it was one of those

things where if you were like man I

can't I can't do it that's fine somebody

else so that was like no problem I got

this and that was that person's moment

to shine it's a pup ways as many stones

and he got it exactly right so each one

somebody at the table was like I know

what it is what you do the challenge

it's cool yeah in your campaign soup or

maybe not we treat stuff like puzzles

like yeah yeah I was happy that you guys

didn't have to fight either the diva or

the fire giant and the hellhounds yeah

no one got trapped in the mirror of life

stealing yeah yeah where's that one Oh

everyone I said there was I so I warned

the players ahead of time I said yeah

just letting no brick bring a book or

your Gameboy or a switch because there's

a chance that somebody could end up

having to sit out the rest of the

adventure because that first one with

the answer was mirror if you guys have

got that wrong I think the little boxes

there's no way this is a little man

behind

but those little boxes would get lines

through them one one two and then three

with each wrong guess and after the

third wrong guess that mirror turns

around and whichever character is

looking into it is trapped in a mirror

of life trapping and they're trapped in

that mirror

and they cannot get out until the owner

of the mirror in this case the old one

that's the map she's Jesus so I was like

I better warn the place yeah no that is

a that's a real problem from the real

world all right Mira yeah - just read

the one right shows that one first

Noah's looking at it I thought had two

different riddles that's how you

interpret it that's how you but I didn't

have to worry cuz I knew they'd already

solved it we out is already here her

eyes but all the time they won so if you

if you watching thought that was neat I

remember as a player quite liking and

there were all sorts of crazy like logic

puzzles and each one if you failed or

took too long some over timed then you

had to fight this fire giant or this

evil like you can see the divas gonna go

crazy and eventually is gonna attack you

anyway thanks for watching

that was cool yeah and this it is it's

not really a puzzle per se except that

depending on how you react those

characters you could get screwed like if

you think that that somehow it's meant

to be kind of unreal because it's

reached in your memories and grabbed who

these people are but it doesn't know

where they are it's not it's not really

them so they can pretend to be your

friends and so it is possible but yeah

you guys are like no don't touch that

one well also these guys I apologize for

the anti clinica battle but both bad

guys going getting a four

for their initiative I think our

military take anymore no confessional

mercenary company so yeah like 44 points

of damage just as an average 30 or

something I did it was 24 yeah yeah oh

that's right that's that snack the

memory not he didn't he did punch you he

just punched slim and created slim with

just a pseudo pod all right

but you he ate your memory he ate your

memory now I'm like a man I can't I've

been thinking about this for a long time

because especially when I got multiple

bad guys and they're growing a lot of

dice the more dice you roll the more

likely it is you're gonna get the

average anyway and if you're only 15

dice it's incredibly unlikely that

you're gonna get all ones or all tens or

whatever and so it tells you what the

average is and I'm like it tells me what

the average is I might as well just use

it's good so I get anyway I reserve the

right to do that I think it's a nice

option for an overloaded GM so yeah

we'll pick up the the chain of acheron

in the in the in the solarium next week

and then uh I think the last next week

will be the last guest appearance of

O'Driscoll and we'll see what happens

after that thanks for watching everybody

I will be well I'm gonna do a live

stream I think if we can figure this out

on Friday which is in two days probably

around like noon on YouTube on YouTube

we haven't done this before i've never

streamed on YouTube but I want to

because I want to see what happens and

if anybody shows up and what kind of

like what kind of metrics do we get on

YouTube as opposed to what kind of do is

we get a lot of data on Twitch about

who's watching and stuff so anyway until

then dude
