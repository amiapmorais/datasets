themselves not in a nightmare but in a

dark dream

anything else with your email just to

let you know that the Kickstarter is

helps me as a DM remember what did I

call this I can go look it up on the

quality information on there and we all

got gifts set to a lot of presents yeah

I guess I'm stone preschools I put the

wrong one in the wrong

for a mini also it's the right material

[Applause]

it's not literally just hard with your

own yeah which is good because these

obsidian Dicer actually I think I love

the smell of the laser cut wood boxes

when last we left our heroes science

[Music]

I hope folks are following along with

the chronicle of the chain I don't know

if there's a link to it but every week I

sort of write up what happened to the

heroes in the last adventure as though

it were king keeping the Chronicle and

if there's not a link to it in the

twitch chat then there's certainly a

link to the webpage and you can find

another webpage oh there was no

apparently there's no audio for the

intro so whatever I said is now lost to

the midst of time

cannot be no I don't you remember what

it was it's left mine was spontaneous I

thought it said - well there you go

so obviously it wasn't obviously it

wasn't either important or there's a

dark dream yes that's correct that's the

other something so it's looks as though

you guys are about to find a couple get

hanky and a mind with us the mind

witness there was a picture of a nice

black gotta wonder yeah I bet I've done

looks like an aborted mind flayer well

that's one way of describing it yeah

just that maybe not hard just got the

location I've got a whole thing here I'm

gonna wait I'm gonna wait to use this

little so yeah the the chain of Akron

are on the dark dream and you guys have

there's a boarding action happening on

what's called the cattle deck where your

soldiers led by your your retainers are

fighting the do√≠s guard down below while

you guys are clearing out this level and

you manage to open the door using a dead

lifted hand the door opens and you see

this floating column of pink flesh with

eyes and tentacles above and below and

then - - gift looking creatures you guys

have been adventures on me and the time

skate before so you guys know what gifts

are and you hear they're surprised and

they smile and they look at you and one

of them says both background guy Ajax

Achilles tiny guy and then it's gotten

better so we know what that means well I

think sweet just as well well well it

looks like you traded you traded being

slaves Tooele foods for slaves of Ajax

they look at each other and think one of

the most guests comments and it's just

you know slaves count cotton pence cough

no in this slaves

it's gonna be initiative yeah all right

I'm gonna like I'm looking to some

sizing them up and I gavel back to them

in their human Wingo what do you say I

say in their even lingo I say in their

heathen link oh yeah I say you guys

can't understand this on guys in their

lingo I say to them we're here to

deliver only death so yeah you guys get

them to join us that's the opposite of

death as an aside to sweet betting

happen

[Laughter]

let's see who's wasting you guys roll

initiative and don't let me know what

the result is until I ask for it

[Music]

this is exciting

watching this write things down in roll

dice let me inform you that I actually

did not use a second little spells lets

you cast time because it's it's like a

racial thing

oh yeah sorry once my left this is the

one of the cool things I actually quite

like about playing in front of God and

everybody is that we all learned how our

[ __ ] works a lot faster than we would if

it were just by trial and error anyway

right this guy

[Music]

well I guess he wrote hi I don't know

about that

well yeah you have a higher tax with

that was almost I can't actually read

these notes I just pretend because it

[Music]

told me that my mini and I put my date

20 in here because 15 20 or whatever you

just plug them out okay it's pretty

printed though so alright yeah

initiative is this accurate I bet not so

your own business Kings down the end

copper and big cat 22 what's your dad's

copper and big cat but that's high 20 24

28 is higher than 20 I'm sorry before

you judge seven nails 11 11 sweet 13

right all right there we go so obviously

you guys don't know in the language like

copper and big cat there's a doorway and

sweet in front of you and then a large

pink room with three figures in it and a

pool of milky white liquid oh we don't I

don't have use logs could you be a

return on that speaker back now this is

where you want yeah

just press the button on the phone once

we actually start the stream we'll have

all this separately yeah yeah still beta

let's see what am i all looking for my

sound bug

that's a good idea once a lien it fits

stand by

do you think of what we're gonna do at

all yep we want to keep them mine thingy

a library what's it called a mine

witness well if we can I mean if it yeah

so my knees up or think we're gonna have

to we've got this table wine witnesses

here has plaintiffs are great but you

know as players we have yeah but as

characters have we experience these yeah

that's our merrily in the Underdark

credit oh no how do the exam okay what

are you a big guy that I'm gonna start

shooting okay

at the gift with an arrow with an arrow

from meadow through clear 16:16 missus

do my other

[Music]

2424 it's for six damage but then so I

hit them so I'm gonna have they can move

closer

so what's up when you hit that is number

one this is everyone

they did six damage where's the door oh

there it is

it's right in here you can't see but

it's right first week fine it has a it

draws a long silver safer and gets

prepared to it looks like the engage

your cat okay and then I will attack yes

as his action he is a reaction to get

their noise you shot yeah you shot he's

his reaction to your shooting move and

now he gets an action nice 20 sweet

the train was really it was the tray

that did it as it was I think it was

that's the first time you rolled like

really well with like first the tray is

removed the curse this is great news

Aaron I need roll two more stone guys

back up 10 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 it

was the most direct big has ever done it

yeah so feet count walks in was that one

attack was that yeah by crit so right so

yeah so big cats max the sitting across

the head with a tentacle its tentacles

with barbed and so it leaves these like

razor like slices across the 50 Yankees

face and get making sweaters and gift

[Music]

is that okay yeah all right well let's

see I need Player's Handbook look up how

it spell works it's under so use nails

their language it's well I mean it's it

it's a rudimentary language really sort

of discern to my father what that child

like grunts that's what it sounds like

when nails answers you know you just

turn my phone off so what did he say to

you something about delivering this to

Ajax I tried it is you're charismatic I

think we're looking for a higher caliber

so this guy walks forward and visit the

forum explodes into water vapor and then

behind you the water erodes and

recalescence any attacks misty step

correct

or I should say a reasonable conclusion

the get my key makes Dolph's great so

worth the tax well what's your class

wait don't tell me

it is 16 16 they both hit unless you

have some kind of like yeah so I'm

thinking I don't think

if you have any kind of like mage she

[Music]

ain't no mage holy crap just the best

damn Ranger yeah oh my god so 16 17 18

points of damage X and there's 16 points

of no.22 great sort of tax that's 1603

33 I'm down oh it just by once I'm down

[Applause]

so does ear does anything cool happen

with that when you go down oh just oh I

can yeah it's a promotion attack there's

no one for a bit guys what I know if I'm

hit yeah but

[Music]

right cuz he's no yeah you're right

copper goes down no no this guy tries to

the same thing you know responsible to

hit my control block AC 14 this is but

AC 22 it's 17 words attention from a

giant silver great sword

that's all these rooms were Nova on it

they looks ancient

this is great sort of looks much older

than anything else that they are highest

why is the battery already at 15%

no idea you have to turn on battery back

this is the same problem in less time

how much was it sorry this is 17 1 7 and

then it's going to you sweet

[Laughter]

okay I'm gonna after that attack though

I want to use my reaction to do bloodied

but unbowed that's sounds good when you

take damage that reduces you to have

your maximum hit points or less you can

use your reaction to gain temporary hit

points equal to your pugilist level

flush your calm modifier and regain all

expended grid points yes all right

[Music]

so those are grid points that you

expended from previous battles yeah I

was help and now I am taunt

cool well probably this is the last

thing you'll have to do it won't be any

other battles and you don't play any

time to rest on this alien ship well

soon well let's see here move me like

right in front of nails

I think he's standing in front of the

door can you get by there can I die with

my crew right now is a sweet yeah yeah I

can well I mean I'm asking can they

can't you can't move through an enemy

yeah notice you have some kind special

ability because this is the doors just a

square it looks like okay we need to

move through an ally right if I thought

that

yeah but she's no no these are walls

okay so I can't do it move it back

on someone nails nails as a blocking

swoop as wallace all right then let's

start punching we are we all face no or

announce it Ferb yeah all right so

here's my first year in corridor and

there's a dual tax you can even be where

we want but there's only a one by four

difference all right I'm assuming that

ee-yeah is 26

it's correct all right so both head

[Music]

there's thirteen and another 11 so 24

and this is to the guy right in front of

me right that's number two yep and then

- how's this shove it shove attack work

I have no idea

you just strength to check against their

strength or dexterity is it's not the

name of the shovel

yeah I can do I can do I can use a do it

bonus action and expend a trip to make a

shove the tack shutting page one day

bottom pretty great show them to the

ground or just shove them back so I

can't move into the room so we're gonna

film at 5 feet or make prone by the

winning strength check use the attack

action to make a special melee attack to

show the creature so it's a it's your

action okay and you make a you make a

melee attack instead of making well you

could make an athletics track justify

their athletic strength but well that's

your role though whatever you're old

sweetie room yeah and either way it

doesn't there's a one well okay what's

the what's this is that you're including

your athletics bonus well that would

make it a nine

that's pretty good these guys don't have

athletic skill they're just a +2

yeah there's always a check with a skill

you can't critical fail to skill wrestle

there's always a chance this is worth a

try

yeah well it's just good to know how it

works all right that's it for me that

was sweet its nails similarly I'm D

materialized into a cloud smoke and

we're playing this guy advantage with

advantage with advantage I pull it

dagger out of my jacket there that's a

Chris wow it's the first crit that I've

ever rolled yeah tom has ever rolled in

dungeons of dragons there's actually

there's a Twitter feed called MC DM

stats so where are they track they do an

exhaustive scrub of every episode and

track what die rolls everyone makes how

much damage everybody else prints and

how much damage surveys taken Tom has

taken no damage this is all just a dark

dream may be the first person to ever

combine a modular synthesizer doing this

dragon is I'm offended yeah that's the

starving magneto Wow Jesus Christ

alright so weight is automatically a

three from

so that's 36 that's your dagger strike

it's a spell

it's a oh sorry as I ain't what's this

it's a dagger in this guy's back you see

this bright green burst of flames like a

surge into his body

sweet yeah that's you part of my fern a

killer man Wow what's what's twenty five

and twenty four forty nine forty yeah

that's that guy drops yeah don't forget

that's already another dude damage yes

yeah put the phone to like stop it

that's that's email okay but yeah

whatever next nice I guess it can see

uh-huh

[Music]

sweet yes no actually make a make a

wisdom safe just though mind wouldn't if

the might with this spins around and has

all these different Ice Dogs 21 that's a

20 or not you are hit by a ray and

you're fixated in the spins a red light

that comes from one of the tentacles but

doesn't do anything do you shake it off

for a second there you felt like the

sense of like terror but you're you're

sweet

[Music]

[Laughter]

so the my way this is trying to attack

us alone I've seen worse correct

just shot a laser pointer sweet sigh hey

[Music]

too busy playing with my dice trick I

need big cat to make a charisma save so

I don't know if you have a cat stats

there but just Badou it's probably not

proficient in Korea if I doesn't say

like it shows bonuses but not like I say

use their own CI just use the bows for

charisma get its negative 1 cell 17

yeah this thing's super effective yeah

yeah this if it beans a green like big

cat and big even to surrender right away

stop like less you want they go someday

that laser pointer someday

[Music]

[Laughter]

alright it also points a purple ring at

nails I'm gonna definitely action does

that have it's got different eyeballs

and they're all looking around and they

CH have different iris colors it points

and that bathes nails in a purple light

but nothing happens

oh my god to a god

okay so this guy's down out would be

lettin go go the other good thank you

and I can start get the engagement

it's amazing how quick like that so just

do that by the way outside is the

corridor that you guys walked up here it

goes goes straight down there until then

you see those week the cores the

doorways that led to the Sinai Canada

does that mean that there's enough room

in this quarter for me to give image on

this guy no I'm down yeah

you're down yeah okay dead or I should

say unconscious characters do not

granted man well yeah okay but if

someone else would know the wall that

would imagine the walls just kept like

you could stand here if you wanted to I

guess what well you can't get advantage

baby yeah yeah yeah stand over recovers

body likes don't Lennox my plan bridge

to attack the great sort of on Flatbush

does aim yeah alright let's fish stern

your met does a 15 minute are you are

they squishy no

no there there there they are where

they're wearing a plate they're actually

quite well armored I got in that room

that's 22 you had yeah all right and I

do that was 207 so +5 is stupid all

right

I do 12 damage well that was judge are

you done yeah you don't put any seals on

where 900 mommies those slacks well

there you go you got a big [ __ ] all sort

though you use this so that was so

you've been effective King you're up

nine help oh nice thank you

it takes Sun on your turn you can stand

up takes honking that's paternity and it

is not your property

oh I will take half my movement so fit

that fifteen and then I will use my

bonus action and bull escape disengage

and 15 avenues day so there's a wall

behind you know this okay are the same

and I will shoot it

he tries to he wants to but your tiny

little goblins and squirrely tiny little

squirrely and he's like I am

[Music]

18 plus no 13 plus 20 30 I hit f8 damage

Hey yeah

the 14 m/s unless someone else no Phil

probably want to attack well you know

for it do me he'll take them down man

well I can't attack I can't move you hit

them once so you get your reaction thing

right did you not oh you're right yeah

hit em yeah yeah all right sorry

etherium advantage 13 plus 7 a hit and

for a damage dead you shoot forgive you

oh yeah that was that was that was it

because yeah yeah became I'm angry

because because it's human as pet human

as pecking American so now both of the

gifts are down and the mind witness stop

stacking yeah there we go

he's got off the were coming so I'm

thinking to my room so you can have no

wait don't don't take them up well I'm

we're gonna basically we're gonna take

the heads down to the below deck where

all the Fighting's going then to show

them the

their commanders are defeated and then

we're gonna say you can be part of the

chain [ __ ] you just gotta follow the

rules all right so we're gonna go in and

figure out what's up this might minutes

think somebody with high charisma

probably all kind of [ __ ] right now so

it's like I'm doing this yeah I walk up

to the to the mind witness yeah there's

a giant fleshy call a big flush a column

of eyeballs how big is it

it's it's it's like as big as that shelf

the shelving unit just floating all

right that's yes big it doesn't have a

man come inside this is a large pink gin

there was actually uh sorry dude fan art

of this yeah so this it's he's talking

to him sorry yeah you're able to get

here of the harvest to get heads get

heads get something I thought it's gonna

say to them all right so I'm assuming

that this thing is like sort of the

brain of the ship right like yeah this

is sort of the nervous system

controlling the ship so sure

okay I just sort of like reach a hand

out towards it and try to just sort of

sense anything there's any kind of

energy can we run I mean what would you

what will be there is definitely an

intelligence there and it's waiting

all right I picture in my mind's eye

that the tentacles that are holding

their also CLO yeah

just relax yeah you hear a voice in your

head and it's a a very kind of relaxed

sibilant female voice say this form of

communication is unrecognized now let's

just talk to it dictionary that doesn't

mean it can't hear that's a good point

yeah I'd take sweets advice and I say I

command you to release the rustle CLO I

command you to release the Roses CLO

[Music]

[Laughter]

yeah okay sure if that works yeah no

there's no way there's no way for you to

know that it's working because of where

you are you don't have a right insight

onto their also so you know but you can

feel the you can feel the deck of your

on shift a little bit go check out a

wind-up cephas yeah you can see that the

tentacles are withdrawing doesn't have a

response

[Music]

do I like I would know that it had

reacted that way though right

or just just when the shaking of the

deckard like do I get anything I got

information flying you get you get the

you you get you definitely get a sense

of following orders cool sweet you are

the you you should be the like the

master now go to your head so this range

is fully enclosed there's except for the

doorway that we came in on there's no

way out well there's another doorway

over there but it's no way okay alright

wait till you just the doorway that's

like we're like basically behind big cat

there's another door okay okay

so yeah the Navigator is just waiting I

think we should take the go down and try

to get the combat should we check this

on the door here first

see if that goes below deck sure so I

don't know where it is but I guess I'll

cuff your hands on this door can you ask

the mind witness a question can you just

ask it how do I get below decks yeah

[Music]

yeah what's in there it's a 20 by 20

platform and it's got interior panel

with a bunch of crystals on

I guess I will investigate it see if I

can figure anything out about it have

you seen anything like this before

no doesn't like Land of the Lost

no it's not like it's not like a it's

built in the wall it's kind of like in

the same place that the hand thing was

yeah we're going to preserve that in

that hand so soon turn that into a cub I

mean it's a panel with a bunch of

crystals on it some calamari no all

right are you all good to like leave

them my witness because they're so

weightless hop on this this thing less I

can go somewhere I mean the white I was

thinking the white substance beneath it

is in the rest of ship like that's maybe

I would sense it signals out like it's

like that might not help us with any I'm

just going to say to the mind witness

yeah open that door well the door is

already oh yeah yeah never mind never

mind

we don't need to activate the panel we

have a hand this thing will take an

elevator

yeah I get on you come wonderful yeah

judge you see [ __ ] butts come walking

rapidly up the corner okay what's up

butts I didn't know if this I don't know

if I was wanting to know butts is your

half-elf

oh yeah

about half lean for some reason anyway

yes she says I'm sorry sir I didn't know

who should be the one to come tell you

but I figured I figured of all the

people it should probably be me we've

taken to the lower decks oh great that's

fantastic what was down there it looked

like a bunch of slave pens uh-huh yeah I

mean a lot of the other thing there was

a lot of arguing but I was I was pretty

sure that they were slight bends did you

free the slaves I don't think there were

they were empty

oh they're empty were you fighting about

work art interesting did you see any of

these and I've sold the feds oh oh I'm

not sure but I think that's gift get

this ere I get the Yankee no we didn't

see any severed goods

okay any any fully ones bodies no no are

all the due regard due regard dead yes

okay I think we've done how manage to

release the Rose Osceola good yeah so I

think can we go back what do you think

it's up to you commander

we want this ship she said she's looking

past you into this room while you're

talking to you sir I apologize but can I

speak to you in private sure yeah okay

so there are other room though you know

the rooms with the nails is talking to

the mind witness or communicative

standing in front of us and buts is now

alone with you and but says sir those

nails with you the entire time

I think so what I'm not sure if this

means anything but the heat was also he

was also down on the cattle deck with us

how long that was that well he might

still be down there he was down there

whenever you left to come up here yes

yeah he was largely responsible for the

death of the daughter and and I should

report that also several of our own

troops were killed in his fireballs was

it from the necklace necklace

like he had a fireball necklace was it

from that or something else you just

pointed in fire well I don't think he

else can do that on his own all right we

should probably good I'm Melissa

fireball do you want to wait we don't

want to leave him because if there's two

of them then one of those imposter all

right so yeah because I'm gonna run out

real quick and I think I'm just gonna

wrap and grab nails probably by the arm

and try to pull it back away from the

mine witness well people are hurt

downstairs I'm gonna go down stairs well

hang on you don't know anything yet

right yeah she told you aside as you

reach out to me I turn around to meet

your grasping hand aha when I say I

don't think you should keep secrets from

me

I don't usually keep sneaking sure me

either let me reword that I don't think

you should try to keep secrets crap

happen at that point junior officer

butts step into this chamber place

so you see butts sort of like pulled

against her will like she's being

physically drag and she looks terrified

emails okay

Johanna handle nails does Joe have a

hand on you do you have a handle yes

[Music]

judge you're a senior officer of the

chain so I do not outrank you however

junior officer butts I do not appreciate

the implications that you're making to

the senior command of this military

operation I don't use is implying

anything I think there's somebody who's

pretending to be you down below decks

well as the captain of this vessel I

consider this act of insubordination

grounds for a demotion butts explodes

there's like a pink mist now

once there was butts all right so many

is my foreign country so basically you

gotta make it four isn't a safe against

my charisma and if I do that then I can

use if it's successful that I'm gonna

use the rest of the HP I have left to be

able to do to tap your HP you open a

conduit to as locus but there's nothing

at the end of your there's not there's

no nothing to grab onto nails are still

there but you're still holding it but

there's no doesn't work my ability

doesn't work no on nails or just doesn't

work at all I guess there's no you can't

yeah you're unable to normally you are

able to sense the life force of the

thing that you're touching and draw some

of its energy and there's just nothing

there okay

in that case all right so I have to look

this up because it's all gonna happen

very quickly and really in the game time

but like I know you don't know how to do

this so I have to look it up real fast I

was going to grab him look so dude we

said we're just standing right outside

like we hear this exchange you can hear

nails this voice actually sounds a lot

like like when Ajax spoke huh you can

hear nails is voice echoing throughout

the thing and he's now declaring himself

the captain of this vessel yeah

stand down nails this is not nails I'm

just gonna see what he does as you wish

commander you explode to down on your

knees and your hands behind your back

let's not be hasty do it soldier sweet

if I have to tell you again there's

gonna be consequences

[Music]

commander sweet maybe I should be the

commander all right just put my dad

forward [ __ ] we need to roll

initiative what are you trying to do

you're trying to clock males submission

I mean our is how does Niels feel about

that 18 plus 8 yeah you giving them new

clocking a 9 Plus 8

yeah your hand connects and you see

nails us face snap act just like he's

been hit but it doesn't appear to

doesn't hurt him no it's like possessed

or something I tried to stop him earlier

and there's no life force

Benny bullet bugs yeah are you like a

wave you had to wade through

but these life does live in there's

minor organs there's just this pink mist

and sprays everywhere and the two buses

buses clothes

commander don't let this attempt at an

insurrection cloud your judgment you're

the one interrupting

[Music]

perhaps I did act in a bit of haste yeah

I reach out my hand as I close my fist

five-year good boy little squidgy bits

bitter strewn across the floor and

against the wall start to jiggle and as

if being blown by wind they sort of

coalesced together in the center of the

room and warm back up into butts I don't

feel well you can go to your bunk [ __ ] a

second ago you weren't even here what

what's wrong with nails his eyes she's

like not hundred percent you should go

back you should get out here but I'd

rather not but if you insist [ __ ] she's

looking around like well this is still a

retreat now yeah are you sure you don't

treat need me but how I should go if you

go down to the cattle deck you will find

a small tentacles attached

you should return to your chambers on

that [ __ ] which addressed she says and

retreats you're dismissed

she actually is like she's like on

autopilot I'm like so confused I don't

even know to do right now can we just

kill him

we just kill Oh apparently God and I

just I just I [ __ ] collaborative man

I mean did he take damage I mean how do

i I want you like can I found him like

like or like boots

butts is leaving can I tell him/her to

people send with nails up the other the

nails that's downstairs the nail that's

downstairs the nails that she saw

downstairs

what she said I think she's like

scrambled up that's right I didn't hear

her bills

she's scrambled yeah I'll be here bring

up into bed together at the correct way

should if he's I'm sorry if you see

nails downstairs tell him to come up if

I see nails and she looks downstairs if

you see him downstairs tell him to come

up if I see nails downstairs don't think

about it just do it

she says she'll say yes lieutenant yes

yes Khmer yes and she's kind of she's

turning back into herself and she goes

and she walks very quickly please just

don't okay all right anyway yeah there's

a doorway in an elevator and like nails

who didn't I mean like what's going on

like are you punched him and nothing

happened

well I punched him twice he punched him

hard and nails reformed with the bus

punch him again and it didn't do

anything

how does judge when we activist because

I know yeah yeah

but how is judge reacting to that I

think judge wants to kill nails all

right judge has already watched nails

like obliterate somebody and then

recreate them and the enfermo condo

didn't seem to work there wasn't right

there was no there there right I mean

there's nothing that little like steel

can fix but I mean I'm gonna you if you

don't think we should be nervous right

now I'm gonna tell judge to stand down

commander yeah let's let's try and

figure this out I mean I'm the kind of

[ __ ] right now hit him twice

hard hard enough to do 19 damage but

that would have killed how many normal

men like at least two normal nails I

mean so we just along for the ride right

now no I'm just wanna I mean we can

question them like what do you what is

going on with you I listen commander I'm

I'm sorry I didn't mean to use your

voice no longer echoey as you see guys

yeah come in I I I feel like I owe you

an apology

I uh I acted up to turn you basically

obliterated but spots and then recut

brief put all the pieces back together

we've taken the ship butts his back yeah

what did but say that made you do that

there's a second one rounded load X

that's what judge says butts uh well she

was making implications that that I was

a danger to the company

so what's the deal with you have sa kind

that's not the impression I got 100%

agree we're positing time that's why I'm

sure that judges heated right now Ken's

gonna come flood of my room [ __ ]

[ __ ] dude sister are these [ __ ]

who knows who knows today now she be

worried about drooly mess and then

should be useless to me

[Music]

so what am i if i saddle on you nails

you're gonna blow me up too

listen I was I was just in two places at

once that's all so was you how do you do

that I saw how the battle was gonna play

out and I made a strategic decision it

was a calculated risk we took the ship

with minimal loss of life the door to

the thing that you think is an elevator

closes we're not in there right

I don't think anybody's in there unless

it's King just sitting there waiting for

the people to know I walk down yeah I

assume you're all right

yeah the door closes and you hear this

kind of like

so are you all here right now all of you

however many of you there are bonus it's

just all of us all of us right here you

know I am I am a sorcerer judgment yeah

but but there's only one never been able

to do to be in two places at the same

time before I thought I've seen for it

on before you're telling us that you

weren't acting strange at office now

that the echoey voice and the fireballs

and the being in two places at one time

and exploding one of the junior officers

was not unusual or out of order if you

got something to say man you gonna say

it I am just like I'm asking you what

your opinion of that is there's just

text dogs anyway this is it's fine seen

the notes man I got nothing just that

one yeah that's fine Yankee write it I

think you need to return to the rustle

CLO and confine yourself to your

quarters aye

who's gonna drive the ship why we'll

figure it out don't worry

[Music]

we'll talk about this later well as far

as I'm concerned I'm the captain of this

ship and yet you're not a commander of

the chain are you in the chain or are

you not nails seems to think about this

for yeah man I'm in the chain all right

go to your quarters

go to your room talk about this in a

little while you uh you see that you

watch his nails leaves the room okay

boys because me trust that [ __ ] for a

second no no that was [ __ ] weird I

mean we've never seen him do anything

like that [ __ ] before I assume

like there's no reason for us the things

that that is like some something that

nails can do no [ __ ] no right what no

echoey boys and all that other [ __ ] yeah

I mean I don't even think it's going

back to the other ship is what I'm

saying that's true we might be just

going to hide something - baccala said I

acted out of turn you're damn right you

acted that turn you can't just ignore

initiative I mean it just goes to them

basically everything that lets had told

me because I don't like favorite and

obviously my players hurt now your

characters should we go seriously making

a point the fact that like she said she

saw a second one of him it was casting

spells that he's never been able to cast

before seemingly without having to use

the fireball necklace and also the the

fact that now we have members of the

change somebody go back with them we go

check out on

should we go see about nail without an S

but nail better that's just now what

nails nail that's the downstair born as

nails this poor yeah there's nails I

mean there's still the other one went

down on the first floor I see if you can

talk to that thing you got high charisma

okay I'm gonna go to that one why did

you do

Oh mine witnessed open the other door I

say to the madness no I'm gonna touch it

no good luck to you judge will

definitely poke it we're together we can

have a conversation like a piece of

bubble actually it's kind of bubblegum

like like yeah it doesn't it doesn't it

kind of shrinks back a little bit but it

did you could you could it has like a

nervous it has like a basic nervous

system reaction or yeah he's opening a

third heart it doesn't have a mouth or

here's just a little ribbon no okay

well no I can't talk to it well you can

I think I can't communicate with it so

okay wait did you obviously gave us the

my player hand yeah you can have it

before I left I can happen i bequeath

unto you I just kind of toss it at

judges face and leave with nails no wall

dogs daughters cut it yeah like a man

yeah just snatches of a just mentions of

did you make a truck bro no how are you

so king is gone I will announce our only

healer has left us

oh wait

[Music]

all right the elevator door opens and to

get the initiative not 20 - should have

rolled 21

[Music]

for my initiative 21 that's pretty good

[Music]

do you know my kid

I could just imagine that like nails

would be aware and make a decision

copper 16 sweet 21 and the judge 22 Wow

yeah I'm so sweet of 21 and Judge Rose

why - so nails and King are sir

not appearing in this battle so where

are they today well it's actually well

this was can we put the thing and share

it

oops I did that pretty oh yeah draw here

[Music]

these are these are contiguous well

because we've been hoping no no no it's

gonna hear you zone it's gonna think

we've been oppressing them into service

for a while they're meant to be

disposable

I'd be maybe the problem is alone that

we're on oh I guess we are all in here

or something oh that's sweet still here

just looking at his fists instead what's

that

velocity you said hammer hands is dead

jinxed it it's true so you guys are okay

yeah so these get yeah oh nevermind I

can't do it again it's it's the judge

you hear the door you hear the door open

oh it worked Hey look you got perfect

line of sight to the other door just

look very usual yeah you can probably

see them really why I have enough

clothes to than my witness to know

yourself where you work

are when the best I'm like there that's

fine yeah it's all good yeah okay so my

turn

[Applause]

[Music]

let me make you a special PDF let's just

I just you know stuff like time alright

so yeah I apologize I haven't done any

work to streamline the over here

oh no it's just it's just the character

sheet like I just need one where it's

just basic stuff I'll have it is number

one how much damage is you I only did

eight damage that way so that's eight

damage to number one should just

remember that that wasn't one sweet all

right move move me up and next to one of

those chumpies okay to use this one them

well you're not on the purple level yet

but you know this all right you know

just I'm going to Halo he hasn't

attacked yet yeah that means advantage

[Music]

right to haymakers let's see here 19 and

20 both hit choose 17 all right so

that's 26 damage for the first one this

is this the same one the judge okay yes

[Music]

this action do own a satisfaction I use

the old one too which gives me two more

packs holy Shih Tzu haymaker twice it

twice and then give you 17 system a c-17

okay so all of those hits okay does

damage that's that's all I got baby

copper and big cat your teammates have

left the room you're alone with the

might witness mine witness turns and

looks at you with its large milky white

I I could be nails to look at me

[Laughter]

I like the thing she knows would be yeah

hey once again it seemed good or thing

sure you can put yourself you could

certainly bring yourself somewhere judge

duck you can shoot through your ally two

points okay I'm shooting number 124 yes

yeah a damaged arrow goes right through

theirs they don't have noses and that

one though they just evolved that way

yeah and so he goes gonna shoot right

into its skull balls are dead

God that door looks like it spins 2x2

square sixth oh nice

wait I just went over them what am i

doing oh yeah that's fine oh you're

right you can't move through that but

you can go yeah but year but the door

cuts across two squares it looks like

that's all I can make it yet yeah I have

enough yeah yeah I'm done I can't attack

that oh [ __ ] okay

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

sweet

you just clot his buddy

and punched your fist well actually

we're getting killer you did that the

bulk of the damage to him

I can custom a c-17 an AC 16 might go

down better not fight you go down on the

new commander 17 image okay so let's see

here

silver aroond a silver great sword and

he dances with almost as he swings it in

added pivots around his body like it's

almost as heavy li weighted as as the

gift is this greets wear looks better

than mine explodes older oh yeah look I

am very in a very unconscious man sweet

drops to the ground and the gift points

of judge and barks is some kind of weird

yeah that sounds good to get the gift is

done it's now you judge

[Music]

I think police stand can you stand on

the sweets body is it just difficult

terrain it's just a bedroom advantage

yeah I'm knocked me down unconscious

through walls rolling through this

casual stroll that I'm taking with the

king right now it's like yeah wait

that's not fair I don't know what you're

saying yeah so I do I hit two times

um and then I do 23 8 damage to get

Yankee number 2 14:23 he is fresh she's

fresh not anymore though

that's the first damaged I do this is

cool great sword versus great Sonia

judges his fighting style is very

different than we did Yankees the judge

kinda has to Hue and swing this plane

around it looks as though it's a lot

more of a study thing whereas the gifts

is more like like I said well I could

dance with the weapon but judges flam

bears is definitely a strange-looking

alien weapon just like the gifts silver

greatsword is silver rune in great sort

is it's sweet quite make it that safe

Kathy aqui con 4 complete still did they

have them no they've never had purple

blades they have dance that they had and

still have sweet has made this is I

think that was is that the first death

saved the first non coming non larsa's

theater commander failure and now we all

rise in ranks he kneels have a point

that was sweet it's copper copper and it

cap I'll shoot him over there Randall

over there yeah that's he's got six week

to thirteen I miss business I'll check

again like Oh tom is rolling his attack

and his damages there 14 and if I get

this peak at 19

yeah yeah plus 7 8 12 damage 12 damage

[Music]

are you done okay oh let's see you just

did some damage to it you did more

damage to it so one two or three four

five six it get actually he'll split it

up they'll do one great song attack on

big cat I wanna judge big cat hits judge

judge mrs. big cat takes

every time the great sword hits you

sweet like every time you've been hit by

it it doesn't just cut through flesh it

also it creates the sound in your mind

like nails against a chalkboard except

it's a hundred times worse than that and

it makes it hard to it makes it hard to

clean it makes it hard to think it makes

it hard to remember how to fight try

some kind of freaky blade 12 13 14 15 16

17 points of damage too big a problem 17

yep it's a very consistent number it's

funny because actually like I'm only

ever I could just use the average 9 plus

m and B 6 can be won on well the more

dice you all the less likely it is that

your numbers gonna be way far off the

[Music]

right that was the good thing is no

judgement I'll of have we seen him do

this before no but no and she does

obsidian Isaac [ __ ] cool [ __ ] yeah

I'm rolling very good though does he

always does freaka me

8:26 damage i hit both times your grates

our technique proves to be your lives

prove to be greater than the gifts

dancing dancing dancing ribbons oh sweet

go ahead make up deaths a Tony not Yuri

you get to something cool happens you go

you recover some hit points you can burn

you can spend on research or some [ __ ]

at twenty actually dropping zero instant

death really one or twenty oh you gain

if you roll a 20 on the do 20 to regain

one hit me save that so you don't need

any while you do any dealing actually

yeah but you're awakened alive but

anyway you don't have a million copies

not my day

um I guess yeah combat appeals well my

current thinking on it is that you can

use it a number of times equal to your

level

okay so you create this well of Healy's

if I could use and right now he's a

five-time Mecca well I can just use my

he's a conduit as well just to give him

a few points basically but it takes away

from me is the length thank of it I have

a cure wounds as well that I can cast a

second level but at that point I'm

pretty much spent when it comes to spell

casting I probably should have nine

health also oh my god okay witness room

and you'll this may be the end of

fighting but let's just in case you know

so yeah let's heal okay I'll do the

healing spirit okay where Scott so where

yeah where you gonna purge inside here I

think yeah I leave the door open

well there's a iPad Oval iPad looking

mood ring textured panel on the inside

alright I just take the my flared glove

hand thing I just slapper

can't it do anything no was it just

flapping am i clear I appreciate that

works okay we have to get that if we

keep if we manage to somehow keep this

ship we're going to get that thing

preserved yeah the captain's glove fell

if you want to hack you can the

regaining and if you want to act on your

turn you can regaining that point

happens to be giving your turn

well just so you get I mean you're out

of combat all right but you get the rest

of your firm to do stuff if you want so

says Lord Dirac enchant Lord or God

moments okay so I don't know if he's

communicating from from chapter he just

knows how evening night I don't really

wanna stand up oh yeah okay I assumed I

mean I someone's cast a healing spells

I'm gonna so what our nails and King

what are you guys doing we're walking

back to the strip Thomas ASA okay you

get back to the ship

okay for our conversation you see how

the battle is going to go so I create I

don't fight it I'm sorry when did you

see a battle is gonna go we're back on

the ship back in our quarters sure yeah

listen man I'm feeling kind of tired I

think I just need it I think I just need

to lay down for a minute and I lay down

in my bunk all right I'm gonna go tell

massing ham we cleared the ship or egg

Tedesco and then all go ahead and head

back to these guys

captain masa cams like scuttle the ship

I don't know it's contines destroyed

destroyed sick like sick you don't want

us to take it it could be our ship it'll

never be your ship she says it's a

living thing kill it

all right the Ross Osceola starts

pulling away from the dart dream but

everybody everybody stolen ship deck the

crew and she's getting her ship out of

danger her men are still on the ship

some of them are you so you guys are in

the Navigator room I'm gonna close the

door yeah I'm gonna burn at their little

spell slot and to send a sweet message

saying ships leaving get back to the

show

how this message worked is it just gets

a slice sending sending so sending is

usually 25 words any distance to a

familiar creature that recognizes you

and we can reply in 25 words okay yeah

you hear Kings boy said get back to the

ship tomasulo's everyone's still on the

ship can't you hear excite one stole the

ship we can't leave

we can't in our men how many hit points

do you have

right now if you [ __ ] it up baby we'd

get everybody off the ship

well is the Mattel is there still a

bridge across no the tentacles have been

retreated Oh

[Music]

wasn't there a little ship to have nails

mentioned when you have possessed or

whatever he didn't tell buts that there

was a little ship you can xscape in at

the bottom of them no ethical yeah okay

when did that tentacle leave so as you

guys walk down the tentacle and drop off

on the raw so CLO the technical just

goes okay

well we can't come back anyways then I

suppose ascended only like well I guess

what twenty-five words idea and I'm

checking he's got the yeah well you look

up that grout how much we got he'll do

it yeah let's yeah so there's so I get a

total of five be six so I guess if you

want to do four and I'll do one doesn't

look like it's a talkback of course so

if you've no idea I guess you can I

don't know if you erode are what's up

yeah okay just so we know you sent a

short message of twenty but words or

less to a preacher you are familiar with

the creature here's a message and their

mind recognizes you as the sender and if

it knows you can answer in a like manner

immediately yeah the spell enables

creatures with intelligence for of at

least one to understand the meaning of

your message you can send me a message

across any distances and other planes of

existence when that target is on a

different plane to view there's five

percent chance that it does not Isaac

school seventeen damage

and then I'll roll one because this is

[Music]

fine so the Ross OClO pulls masculine

repent get back on the ship will destroy

I feel this Punk dark-green yeah yeah

yeah there's a dark room it had like

another weird name to a somnium to

neveress yeah yeah I'm not gonna

remember that book

[Music]

yeah so she and good esto we're having a

conversation and we took the deck we

can't control the mind witness

controlling the ship

so we'll crash it so yeah she's a little

confused because the the route to get on

and off the ship is now gone so she's

like how are people gonna get back I'm

gonna go wake nails up and say see if

you can talk to it again okay well if

you can if you can if you can create a

bridge to get people back on then do it

get our people off that boat and then

scuttle that ship yeah you go back to

the room and nails isn't there

you go back to the room nails in there

well I go up the massing ham and say

well I guess I'm fired

I search the ship

[Music]

standby

supposed to know can I be level 17 so I

can why can't be my own care

my old characters not how part of it how

far is the [ __ ] it's not it's she just

pulled it away so it would be out of

range of the technicals well you gotta

have like ones like like you could see

on you can see how the shape shoot you

weren't there when she issued the order

alright but you were that when you came

out to talk to her after happening that

seen him go to sleep you could see all

the crew all the crew that were left

concentrating and then Podesta wanted

him to stop once once the dark tree was

it has a website

all right well the desk over there like

ropes or grappling hooks we can throw

over there the people can hook to the

ship and try to slide over her climb

over

Clemmy it's out of sight now she pulled

shooting that far away yeah she got

cheatsheet she got her ship away from

the thing trying to destroy it as soon

as the tentacles were or loosed she's

like let's get the [ __ ] out it alright

wait far enough that you can't see the

[ __ ] right that's like miles no that's

the you're on the astral sit you can see

about 30 feet off the miss miss yes

they're usually covered in it's like

they pack in cotton

well we don't know [ __ ] we're just like

in a room I told ya I guess thank you

now that we're healed I'm gonna be like

apparently the ships leaving so we need

to we need to figure out what we're

gonna do here well let's get let's get

it up so you couldn't you couldn't get

that the thing to do it was not

responsive it didn't even try to talk to

me or anything if I should turn talking

I mean I don't know why I would be able

to do anything that you couldn't but

mm-hmm

I mean the thing that was commanding it

obeyed my oars yeah I mean there's

something something we're going with

nails which is where I think he was able

to talk to that thing same with how he's

able to talk with you know I'm sure is

yes there's something weird no you know

it doesn't ever hurt to try though so if

you want to get me go I feel real bad if

we left this room and you didn't give it

a shot right you see a stand outside and

to start focusing on trying to get back

to the ship if you see the somnium -

never a saloon out of the out of the

Mist and like park itself find behind

the Rossi

[Music]

okay well now I try to get a grappling

hook and head back over there Stan why

[Music]

maybe I should do that about a third

level sports lots

I've asked did some questions drive

rough weren't there

I'm just you know who is your commander

it swivels to you and it's big white

milky eye and slipping at you but and

that's my mouth has no airs right they

can't hear you and a cam reply I'm gonna

try like thinking real hard it nothing

happens nothing appears to happen

I'm gonna call you see the the song name

- never Scott pulls up kind of the

tentacles are still like now here but

the ship pulls up next to the Ross

Osceola so that's close enough for a

normal boarding action would like ropes

at grabbing once is done okay well then

I'm gonna go get on that deck and tell

the men to get off ship

hmm okay they they what they they extend

a gangplank the ships are not close

enough for them for you to cross just by

trying to deter dupe over these ports

okay although I'm gonna happen these

guys to home.we their craftsmanship

really it's not what I can say it's in

your message you said that the ships of

leaving should we get out of here rusted

steel is leaving yeah I mean yeah okay

yep yes we should go but we can't just

good thing is she's going to sit out

here forever anyway well there might be

more Yankee hiding in some place and we

just be stuck in the same situation if

they just bring it back over to try to

get to us

[Music]

does it not a defend itself I guess it

was in Sevilla I just don't put there's

a knock there's a knock at the door

don't like that is that key cuz he did

just talk to us who is it it's me boss

glove

there bit slip there it's like it's

another man's like it's sick like it's

sick

off this [ __ ] ship okay execute that

thing I want to but we're really beat up

and I don't know it starts attacking I

don't know if we can withstand that it's

8:30 we'll stay right okay okay

[Music]

i we made there may be some conversation

about what are we gonna do that happens

on screen but we will catch you folks up

when we come back from our bio break my

goal is to play for a 90 minute study

break and that was that and that has to

pee so you think I could just do this

sorry I realized it was him we're back

one of the things that we like to do

after the break it's sort of to enjoy

hanging out with the people who have

stuck around with this long is check out

the fan art that folks have been making

which is quite incredible we are honored

frankly with some of the stuff that

people have been sending us and I think

that we will all get to watch it

together because Jerry's gonna run a

thing over there and we have a TV we can

watch

whoa disgusting today yeah yeah I love

ya there's such a cool [ __ ] look

actually that accurately describes I

think my character I love that that's

how I see that's how I see it yeah yeah

this is so this is a character from the

world-building streams there's some of

the Lords of capital and I just I love

this in fact I think this guy did the

Lady of Moon ice yeah one Tim yeah

he says he's still working on that when

I think it's already for code that's

what it said yeah oh thanks

oh yeah yeah it's cool the little little

tip of the hat there F yeah yeah look at

that yeah yeah there's a ton of great

articles no yes there's multi nails yeah

yeah that's Hugo that's actually kind of

how I picture in my head yeah he's

covered in rats and you can see the

wrappers great oh yeah a little bit

sordidness - yeah

rollin stuff is so dry nothing bloody

bit we just literally saw yeah that's so

cool like I want to see that show I want

to play that game where those are the

characters it's like a side scroller ah

yeah this is so he's like I was snowed

in

I was snowed in so you put the bars

piece yeah yeah that's yeah why why

would you guys want to rebelled against

him yeah because he's a wiener yeah we

don't like him

tomorrow is the three year anniversary

of my youtube series already new

Harlequin red sky said the first video

went live or went up on February 21st

is this your any big game series yeah

three years since I started saying hey

you can run D&D it's fun and the series

by the way isn't really about the rules

of the day it's about the technique of

the attention master yeah there's about

the rules well you know I think being

fair is awkward but the rules are I like

to finish so when last we left our

heroes where is where is everybody for

the people who have been tuning in and

watching right now I know that Judge

copper and sweet are still in the

Navigator room yes

headed back there and you are coming

back here and yeah I think I know where

nails is do they know where nails is do

you guys know where nails is okay no oh

by the way we are we did have we are

having somebody came in on Friday to

diagnose our audio we put out a cry for

help on Twitter and our web page and you

got a lot of really talented and

experienced folks saying that they were

local anyone to help and so we picked

one and they're coming in on a Friday

and so hopefully this time next week our

audio we have we have a really nice gear

but we're just not super experienced at

using it so if you're if you having

problems hearing us so there's a lot of

different levels and stuff like that

we're working on it it'll get better

okay so yeah all right so where the hell

is nails well I think right now our

concern is that we want to take out this

this mind witness thing before we like

leave this ship so nobody else can take

over this ship

let's like walk over to it like we're

gonna try and talk to it he doesn't know

I don't think has ears right yeah of

course it's so and I came across did I

see this Jena falling apart or anything

yeah I mean no it's not it's not no II

don't see anything falling apart oh yeah

yeah that's very angels here too

yeah did angel finish he just came here

to say yeah well he'll like point to the

wall and there's like this thin seam on

the wall that's like as you watch it

attenders goes you know they're not

solvable isn't it yeah he's like

everything's kind of slowly

disintegrating right like there's not

holes and stuff yet but all right that

is it supposed to be that boss no I

don't think so do you know where nails

are again do you know where nails is no

Lizzie was you know we heard he was blow

decks though he was that was a while ago

after the battle was done he took off

all right I assume he came

all right okay yeah you want me to find

him I can find him find them fast

okay sure tell him to get back here he's

[Music]

smart to send them away when they need

firepower but who has red arrows I've

got one at least do you don't want these

on this thing that I'm three I guess I

won't use one oh dude are you sure we

don't need more d's mortem mortem more

tool you probably think that he does

they disabled so they're not bad and we

want this [ __ ] I mean I think it would

be [ __ ] awesome yeah well if it's

falling apart

yeah but we don't know why it's fine but

you might be able to I'm not gonna just

do it but okay

oh the painter says by the way for those

of you watching you didn't miss any kind

of plotting or scheming literally they

were just like what the [ __ ]

they're just like Tom what the [ __ ]

[Music]

expressed how angry she was at both ah

man died and I was it we high-fived it

supposed to be an arty man Jim hey he

put butts back together what more can

you ask

seriously did after eat does he know the

does he know the Robie story I don't he

might know it but he wasn't there for it

this is completely different

no it's this is completely different

than them do you know the Robie story

yeah I know the Roberts story

without an ism video like pretty awesome

ops massive awesome pretty massive do

some serious [ __ ] I can't believe I

can't believe Robbie backstabbed us like

that the arrow

let's try anything oh here we go ready

okay I wouldn't do that you hear you her

nails his boys just dude what the hell

am i back yet

sure yeah all the way up to here yeah

but did Eve did he materialized in

Friday yeah I would just think how long

the corner is and how and the timing of

it and whether or not it was reasonable

for him to know you guys you're running

up their nails goes you know I this

thing's fault you know I the ships

falling apart this [ __ ] doesn't have a

captain rather it doesn't have a pilot

but you're back on the ship so are you

the pilot how do you become the pilot

standby I mean I'll just tell you I'll

just say there's some kind of interface

there's some kind of directing interface

hmm we do we do we need Adam is like

quick so basically it's somebody

enhancing scale and that most of them do

we need the [ __ ] jelly mold to

control the ship put it this way I think

we need the jelly mold to steer the ship

just use your the one you didn't the

mindless

turns and looks at nails I was able to

catch back up to the brothel Cielo I was

able to catch ass back up to there also

Cielo it took a significant amount of

concentration on my part I want to talk

to you alone could you guys excuse us I

can relay yes well actually typically

what we would do is the three of us we

would leave I want it I don't know why

I'm pointing to us our monitor I want

them I want them to see yeah oh yeah so

you three [ __ ] off that's the one

problem so far with the bio break is

that it only goes in one direction then

we don't have any hair anyway alright so

I assume we went to a different remember

yeah I don't forget there's all those

all those little ponds they're each

about as big as this area

alright Durand tell me what is going on

with you will alow sweet listen man I

thought we agreed

look you're acting weird the name stay I

need to be able to trust you it I need

to be able to trust you I'm not saying

it in front of anyone else but you

didn't use this full name though right I

just said Duran I need to say well do I

look I'm asking like I said just said

Durant okay so I'm not asking what you

did say and I'm asking what you intended

to say did you do care intended to

invoke his name okay so don't use a full

day man okay yeah Durant Aaron heart so

when you say that I want his eyes but

back to mama I want to know what's going

on with you

you don't remember what's going on dude

you've been acting really strange you

you you've you exploded like doing ice

doesn't like the last thing you remember

was the Maelstrom and a-three

dragonflies Wow becoming it so you don't

okay you don't know where you are you

don't know you don't know you're on the

Haskell see oh wow so yeah there's a

moment of what the [ __ ] holy cigarette

falls out of my mouth

commander what the hell is going on

holy cow you've been acting really

strange yeah well I just yeah I need to

I need to sit down for a minute man all

right so then what did where where what

is this place

all right so is quickly and sort of high

level as he can suite is gonna relay

everything that's happened since we've

gone through the Phillips we can tell

like I get so you're like listen we're

in the astral sea we escaped the

Maelstrom right right but there was like

what are you gonna tell him about what's

coming with him well I want to tell him

when we when we came through the

Maelstrom he was knocked out his eyes

were silver he's been acting really

strange

he he he was able to control the ship he

explode he blew up butts and then

remonda sounds like he was insubordinate

he you know he kind of threatened to

take over the the chain I punched him a

punch to twice

full strength and it didn't even faze

you does he hurt now yeah actually you

do if you do feel like even worked over

man yeah you feel like you've been

working

yeah Wow so how does nails react to this

like is he visibly shaken as he is he so

that's the that's the speaker saying

there's been no music for a while he's

he's sort of his eyes are darting around

the little pod like he's trying to

search for an explanation like he's

trying to wake up from from whatever

this insane situation he's found himself

in is Wow okay so I I attacked I

attacked but you touched buts and she

exploded into a million little tiny

Jubilee bits and when I reprimanded you

for it and then I you know worked you

over a little you managed to do yeah if

I could put her back together again well

I'm amazed and sort of pleased that I'm

not dead the crew said you were in two

places at one time you were throwing

fireballs I can't throw fireballs I know

is the ship still falling apart it's

it's like you you have to look for it

okay right but if you look for it you

can see that they're like a little tiny

like and they and and and nothing

happened nothing like you would have to

sit there and watch for a while Denso

going so it's not like back in the

movies where it's just like no no no but

it's definitely like if you if you know

what to look for if you're paying her if

you're somebody who's got really high

perceptual an angel and you you're like

there's something going on like who

knows how long it's gonna take for this

whole thing to fall apart right this

rate it could be weeks okay but it's

it's so there is some process of

degradation but anyway you were able to

talk to to that jelly mold and you were

able to control the ship by telling the

jelly mold what to do I don't know man

you're like possessed or something

ah so you don't know anything I don't

remember a thing that I remembered I

last thing I remember I was tying myself

to the railing with the real ones

alright and now we're on this cockamamie

thing do we still have the other ship

yeah it's it's still there although I

don't know how for how much longer if we

want if we want to try and come and dear

this ship I think we need to do it fast

because it looks like it's coming apart

can you still communicate can you

communicate with that thing now wait

we're not we're not different I could go

in there yeah let's go back and see if

you can communicate with with the gelly

you guys can come back I can give it a

shot bus nails and sweet so sweet sweet

testicles nails going to talk to you and

they leave right and then they come back

after about as long as you guys were up

they walk back in the room and nails as

I back normal welcome back nails nails

you've never seen this room before

it looks like the like the interior of

some large organ like you're inside a

lung or heart chamber it's pink pink man

can say is in a tank he's okay and that

happened there's this giant columnar

thing of flesh with tentacles and a

giant milky eyeballs every minute I

reminded him of a few things and he

snapped out of it you talk now

all right well masking him off to go and

she said crash this field so way to make

a call pretty quick or we're gonna be

left if you can still communicate with

that with the jelly mold all right

where's the shut you were you weren't

talking to or was wasn't talking to it

yeah you could hear he used his voice

like it was it was when that deco by the

way you hear that in your minds oh we

still here no no like it's not a it's

not like if you cover your ears

you can't hear nails talking but you can

hear the Pecola Neil Sedaka so I walk up

to the jelly mold and I study it

momentarily yeah all right jelly mold

mm-hmm I'm trying to think of which way

okay so we're on the starboard side of

well also CLO yes okay yeah all right

jelly molten hard to starboard nothing

happens yeah

weigh anchor nothing seems to happen

you would get one more get one more shot

where's the Eason left right forward a

little arch as the ship starts going the

nails as eyes are back to being silver

what is going on so you fix this how'd

you do that

mm-hmm can you go back to normal yeah

can you turn it on and off or something

back to normal what do you mean

alright nails here's what I want I want

you to do for me I want you to tell this

thing that I am the captain of the ship

mm-hmm and it has to obey me so it's up

to you how to express this but nails

nose and I think this is what you're

trying to get across before that in

order to command in order to like stop

the degradation of the ship it needs a

pilot right and that that is a direct

air fix that's what nails was trying to

express last time like it's not a title

but isn't this the thing that this is

the Navigator this is this is charter

course right and then it's like this is

like a computer system and you can tell

if you can you can tell this thing all

right okay what direction to point it in

but if you want to if you want to stop

the ship from falling apart it needs

pilot I see okay tell the stuff the

motion that you felt a lurch now happens

again in Reverse mm-hm all right so we

need to find wherever the the place that

you pilot this ship you know wherever

the pilot's seat is this is not this

this is a nails knows where it is huh

where's where's the pilots where does

the pilot go yeah okay now yep let me

give you eventually but not right now

let's see let me look at my notes

I don't where it is hang on sorry yeah

it's uh two levels up from here all

right let's go all right

lead the way follow me nails all walks

up to the door and the door just opens

of course I still pull up in my clear

hand yeah keep that yeah you never know

you never you never know when you might

need a deadline Flair's gonna make a

great souvenir from this fry it up why

some calamari no copper the you guys do

you all get the elevator to your

following else yeah yep okay nails

presses a series of crystals in this

thing and the elevator starts to drop

you feel this light pressure from below

as the elevator lifts can you teach each

other how to use that thing apart can

you teach King how to use it or any of

us how to use it

that's appeal I doubt it why

it takes a tremendous amount of pull

mentally you say we're not smart enough

[Music]

[Laughter]

hmm that's why is that like intelligence

[Music]

power combined princess the power line

so you couldn't teach King how to use it

I mean King make a make a investigation

to check I can these guidance on my

stuff right sure yeah cuz you know your

well yeah yeah because you know you're

trying to remember something 19 that

you're pretty sure you can press the

button see pressed but if there's a pin

number you remember the pin number the

doors okay

go ahead open it and I didn't you knew

any new tiles I think four by four if we

have four by four black tiles attention

tactical stream prepared to be nauseous

[Music]

okay oh it's it's Eric doesn't know it's

two by two hundred say it's for top

dollar my sleep

you said it didn't work listen to the

sound of my no that's the problem see

it's a it's kind of settles it doesn't

line up just gonna lay the line up the

lines don't I think it means they're

upside down yeah Hales it's got the

mines it's goes he's got all the brain

that's the exact same things then no

because now these lines line up you guys

are looking at those lines yeah they

were up the actual grid lines do not

know yeah hello it was just just flipped

they don't line up I figured it out with

the power of my specialized elevator I

did I think I'm done waiting into the

land yeah oh there we go this is how

they this be over here a seven should

that count towards your twitter twitter

stats trying to bounce the dice off the

back of the box on to this part here so

it actually doesn't tilt oh yeah yeah

[Music]

uh-huh I need a whole bunch of those

guys there is a when you left King today

good were they waiting for us or this

decision because you grappled on right

and then know that we did a gangplank

okay so our men are boarding back on

their ship and I came over here so you

talked to you guys okay so there I've

already told you they want to go yeah

and they said destroy the ship

yeah so the main just so yeah we might

just get abandoned you don't hurry the

[ __ ] up

[Music]

well we could always just have the

shuttle wrap back hold of it grab this

another ship grab all of it yeah where'd

you find that one just what I was asking

in in this in here where they're not any

already checked this one right here

fighting under you

isn't that for rigor not very note or

something yeah I they had to go grab

swim innings

yes I do not know what happened to the

once I have mastery that's so many shows

this is mu s art sorry I assumed you

were you look macho yeah correct

those are no I go the door yeah

can you have they're not gonna be able

to us got it can you have the ship just

sort of gently hold on to the Russell

skelux I can't leave for follow it or

something I think Madison has enough

food to [ __ ] out that's all right we're

not gonna hurt we just want it to look

gently hold of it so she can't wait what

it's not the boss of us yeah you can

still communicate to it even though

you're not right in front of it I mean

the jelly molder yes right we just my

name rang for those multiple snails is

[Music]

okay that's why I told you this is a ten

I mean my intelligence is also a ton me

- of wisdom we have 310

we're get our DM ago I think he's

looking for dwarves something we're

doing gene G we've got Tecna Destructo

nails with us right now so whatever is

in this room maybe yeah what you show us

what you got

well very well maybe maybe maybe even

command do whatever's in this room right

[Music]

absolutely here recruit action right

here

come on coop I thought you killed

everyone that is below deck so what is

the point of this room if the navigators

in the other room

this is violence what doesn't have a

captain because it's falling apart

what does it stop too soon us definitely

don't want everybody to work or though

[Music]

faces like the response for that why not

black or why cuz they're wack the crazy

wants it's a basic slender correct do I

dare oh yeah Daryl you're Daryl are mad

yeah the Dwarka are just lawful evil

they're just correct like somebody else

sweet they're never you they're

definitely the nerdy simulation wrote

nails : so my only one who sees that

giant dude drawing-rooms go ahead and

put yourselves in behind those doors

over there those are they that's where

the only spits you out no that's good

yeah it's gonna be what you see what you

see looks to be like a kind of classic

or basic science fiction bridge and

[Music]

you should use there are hey this is not

that's quite enough most eloquent

description I've ever given these chairs

have there are like control panels in

front of them with what look to your

eyes to be mirrors that are constantly

showing different images including

sometimes like geometry and maps and

stuff like that or colored bars moving

up and down it's a very alien seeming

thing step in and down what to tell them

what to do would we have surprised as in

elevators doors open in surprise your

chains here a surprise the job yeah I

think they're surprised oh wait you can

you can like give me it like the

initiative right no that's just me

blocks Cazares but if we have surprised

we get a free rag so the issue is if I

hold my engine up or if I don't attack

cuz I probably I mean I can swap your

initiative okay all right so no I need

to erase it is but I'm thinking very

first let's I mean since you're like I

said since your techno destructive nails

maybe you can convince these guys that

they're better off serving the chain

whoever their current master is who

actually is probably dead some of your

controllers [ __ ]

just walk in there and say look at me

yes I'm the cat just like start you go

like probably open and close windows in

here if you want that pool is like a

it's it's like this high for the dwarves

but it's like waist high or this is a

put this is a pool of like clear white

with X milk the milk yeah I mean copper

can't say oh boy I'm still growing you

have a growth spurt yet yeah I'm a my

growth spurt yeah I'm still girl I'll be

six feet oh that would be a funny

picture yeah copper with like five foot

long legs instilled white weeks all

right judge well sure mr. patient five

five king concern history

nine nails yeah did you roll nine nine

work in copper 25 sweet 19 ok glue that

and swap nails and copper swap nails and

copper that's the lieutenant giving them

commands yep and being a kind of a

combat combat tactician caret and this

dude

the judge was very fine nails you see a

whole bunch of dark boards they are

currently medium size they are not

enlarged they have dull gray skin they

have milky white eyes they have like

solid white hair and beards and they

appear to be trying to run the ship I

step out of the elevator and I just

gesture vaguely towards them and a

massive ball of fire engulfs this area

right here you guys that nail nails

didn't use to no fireball correct

correct

also I'm casting at a level four because

that's my step sorcery ability but the

staff sorcerer ability doesn't leave up

cast past a level you know it still has

to be it supposed to be I think it's

just I think it should be it says you

may cast the spell at one higher level

yes without using a higher level spills

oh yeah oh one that I can't I see I get

it I misread that okay that's a level

three then

[Music]

uh-huh go ahead and roll 86 damage do

you mercy success I do all right so

that's that'll be a three step also be a

three take it forever 732 to like these

creatures will be of no use to us well

this is not so nails walks into the room

and gestures and there's a detonation of

fire that washes through the entire ship

and very badly damages the docked ones

that are trying to run the ship right

now and they are they are like scorched

flaming has almost as though they all

failed they're saving trust sweet okay

when they have a lot of respect for

something to make sure that means

because you don't know if they're on the

right and they're like is it this one is

it this one

so yeah sweet you you you said you want

to talk to these guys we get them to and

nails is like because guys gonna be then

east of us and it just walks in and

starts no they're not dead but they're

not happy

[Music]

there's definitely a very chance they'll

survive now that the damage maybe it'll

be more susceptible to all right well

[Music]

I'll go in just like walk me like sort

of like straight forward no no no no no

like off to the side I want I want to

flip and I don't want to walk into the

middle of them I'm kind of low really

recording yeah yeah like I just I'm

sorry let's see I was there's like six

and as I'm walking I want to point to

them and basically tell them to

surrender

[Music]

do you speak okay yeah what language do

you use to say that to the myth the only

language I know comment well alright how

they look at each other and they're

sneering and lighten that's nearing the

daily okay so they're not they're not

they didn't obey my command

well they don't understand you yeah it's

not their action yeah who knows what

they'll do what they're doing do you do

anything else

damn it

[Music]

I'll throw my accent the closest one

that closest one nautical slang is that

one this guy all right so useful

nineteen hits there AC eighteen see here

hand accident believe this d6 so just so

you know these three guys all look the

select the same kind of heavily armoured

heavily armored kind of frontline melee

tank dudes I can't get this this guy

this guy looks like he's in charge this

this one has like daggers and looks kind

of more insane than the rest of them all

right okay all right well the only

language I know providers do I use my

strengths well I'm in for damage it's

the same thing to hit and damaged so if

its strength its strength about its

dexta its neck stood out mmm okay well

I'll just say it's probably if it's like

not say undercarriage like like which it

uses no cuz I I think thrown weapons

actually do use your strength oh I think

like the job yes couple challenges for

sure I think a throne a throne a throne

11 does you sister okay well I'm like

that let's wipe that way for have

immediately

yeah okay eleven damage that guy to this

call this dude number 111 damage yep he

does it's got my ex I'm in his skull

that's that's he has York very sharp axe

and he was almost entirely burned-out

skull all right and again I'll say

surrender like point to the ground that

was sweet and now if this guy goes my

pants my mask

yes with your feeble intellects Wow what

it's a personal attack won't stand for

it

yeah this guy what is that

[Music]

Phil make a intelligence save John

that's ten do me a favor and put on my

hand accent nails I don't have any more

[Music]

[Laughter]

it's not something that I planned I

never planned on throwing so then do me

a favor and walk up the nails you are

mine controls okay unless you can't be

charmed during the or or yeah

[Music]

so that's it's just that one out it just

buggered my mind okay sorry

yeah 13 well 13 also misses yeah he's

not heavily armored he's just went he's

just waiting mother but leather my goat

just has now stopped juice to myself

[Laughter]

[Music]

wait isn't this a surprise right yes was

oh wow he wasn't surprised he is the

light master he was entirely certain

that you guys were about to walk out of

there he's gonna keep denying anything

so the way I believe it works is they

can't act but they still get all their

defenses they're still just as hard so

King all right good walk in here I don't

know point here and make a con say for

both those guys constitutional so that's

that dude and the other guy

what's the DC the DC is 15 let's dude

makes it this dude does not make it

alright so do you want to Nestle I don't

they were okay so in a 10-foot radius

from here hmm

there's a loud snap and this guy takes

24 damage let's got takes 12 damage he's

gonna channel divinity to max it out 24

damage yep nice what's the what's the

spell shatter that's cool so this dude

takes 24 damage the other half and the

other guy takes 12 yeah I can maximize

out the damage once a day cool

that's once I cancel if you guys are

like purposefully calling them this dude

and the other guy or if that's just sort

of how it happened organically

that's a fact that's where Wang rod

comes my friend Dave would just be like

this monkey [ __ ] than this and he

would give every do two different

television on Wang rod and they all

became Wang rods yeah he would just yeah

so this guy the this guy's now we had

one time [ __ ] that guy yeah that's right

it didn't hurt that she knows I got

snappy 32 points of fire damage are you

done okay yeah what's working okay judge

I mean

magic missile at second level okay and

so I have four missiles look Joe how

much is out a red I always think of Tim

Korea's darkness in legend when I think

it would like judges skin color and then

the black curve males at the end of his

fingers mmm he's not in that brightly

red but he's pretty much yeah a Yankee

are you not the most of them with the

syllabi dominant to the best but yeah

hurry Jose Hannity it kind of twist it

and stuff in these four darts just kind

of come out it's partly now and I see no

two threes plus one so that's we should

I'm gonna shoot all three of them but

like you said these guys are more

heavily armored I mean it hits them

nothing this dude

oh that's this dude is the most heavily

armored so he's me it to disguise

inflate mailing he's got a shield yeah

so using these guys are in chain and

shield sorry

okay no problem how much drank kills me

as possible in one go if they're almost

dead yeah that's what I was thinking

wait all of the doors have got burned I

thought just the three in the back I am

I correct in remembering that you're the

area requirement was all it's a it's a

20-foot radius yeah so I got could

actually you know what I think this guy

was probably this one might be safe

that guy's probably safe then went down

here okay that's number three then oh

yeah if I landed one right there

number ones dead number two is Palin

here yeah he's a bullet wait so the neck

ace

knowing that information out I'm gonna

have I'm gonna have three of them

actually go to the big guy and one go do

that three plus one sets or damage to

him and then three damage one two three

years

there and then I do for eight this is

good music so I do eleven damage to the

big armored guy here's I'm happier this

three little hell fire torpedoes go

twisting for the earth smashing up

unerringly smashing him actually

actually Louie would leave uh sweet

they else doesn't go oh sorry I got

completely that was judge nails

tell them to swim around our content and

step around here the commander is

ordering you to tell them to surrender

it's funny it's like I can't hear him

the old commander put up with us isn't

that a me question your mechanics your

dead cared what would the old commander

do

[Music]

Brian Boitano he's not here right now

Phil 31 damaged or half as much it on a

failed deck save - - I think everyone

fantastic yeah it would be like imagine

a radius that comes like just close

enough to singe judges eyebrows a tiny

so what's the next Irish what's the

total damage 30 [ __ ] 30 [ __ ] 31 I think

you said there well that definitely kill

this dude

mister is dead slow matchstick yeah 31

this dudes still alive and 31 is enough

to kill this guy yeah I have fire

resistance I just look fabulous as ever

are you in that are you in them no I'm

not in the fire going close enough it's

nice and toasty let me what yeah so that

was nails it's sweet this guy is looking

[Music]

terrifying we stopped a chance to was

actually you can't do anything but let's

go back his weapon out of his hand

just uh can take it from her sit this

one it probably also be good to question

somebody about where the ship games are

over there

alright looks very nice but we don't

know the story I'm going to walk over to

him but as I'm walking past sweet I'm

gonna whisper something into his ear

walking paths with your sweet arrived

nails

sorry where that whisper something into

his ear and walk over to the guy

is it the same thing you said yeah there

yeah the mind witness is gone and now

you're in a completely different room

we're just gonna like teleported to this

other room and there's a whole bunch of

burning dwarves in here

well obviously didn't do that cuz you

have fire oh that's cool surrender all

right good now kick his weapon away okay

he pineal he kneels and then it bounces

head and he gobbles out you in actually

he speaks under combat so he was pledged

I've got somebody those guys the woods

[Music]

anyone's because do you speak under

common your goblin just gobbler just

what else do you speak under not anymore

I don't know what anyone was saying this

whole time I only speak coming in bad

common all right what do you speak I ask

me right now yeah sounds like way more

important matters a hammock you know

this guy

whoa well actually sweet knows what

language is judge okay you guys have

been you guys are going in try speak

into it and infernal okay can you

understand me nope is there a river

safety word for nails this isn't the no

I don't know because you know what if we

turn if we turn techniques about how

long it was

that the eye is lasted before why having

much shorter this time can you

understand I'll speak to him he bow as I

said doesn't make eye contact with this

this silver under whom do you serve you

[Laughter]

as an aside to commander you guys didn't

hear that he were to play guys mm-hmm

he's with us now what should I ask him

what do you guys want to ask him today

Jax said you of course Ajax sending me a

text symbols on the mo'fucker seals

asking how did it better better question

how did you find us here that is a good

question you there how did you find us

speak the pilot lives

the pilot was given instructions who the

pilot who is the pilot he names he names

a name yeah he gives the name that you

don't recognize where's the pilot man on

the captain's deck this is all being

translated by nails yeah is that him

right there no this isn't the counts no

no he was our warlord

was he Howard you were the warlord was

he gift Yankee what was what what was

the pilot I guess Yankee did you kill

him yes yes how did you get he's

confused too many questions - argh argh

explodes now there's a whole bunch of

blood

everyone can you put it back together so

he can take us to the captain stick I

can take you to the captain step ok

let's go to the captain's deck I thought

we were here yeah why you have such

sympathy for lowly creatures

let's get the mic on that I don't think

so I don't know why I don't understand

why you have such a sympathy for these

lowly creatures [ __ ] yeah this is great

yeah really good point we should

probably

that's another elevator like this one

which where's the load was Captain start

it's that's in there is no change what

is this what is this play this is the

pilots this is the commander this is

this is operation since this is dead

what is the status of the ship we told

you to take us to the pilots place you

brought us here this is how it looks

like if you know I see we came in there

and we go yeah that doesn't

it stops here all right you gotta get

out of here hey nails do you know how

many people are left on the ship that

are not part of the chain can I find

that out

he knows that okay oh man yes that's up

that's not an answer to I said dude do

you could you tell me how many I have no

reason not to there's five more people

on the next deck and that's it

actually that's not true there are two

there are two prisoners there are two

prisoners on the next deck there are two

prisoners on the yes Philadelphia

how much I have prisons you at 44 I

other heads crew okay I have do you know

depends on the neck sir and I'm tapped

can I sense these prisoners head hold in

case somebody just you might have know

where they are

stop healing stones we should be a

little bit more interval with the

illusionists if reserve them if they're

worth lugging around I'm good I've been

hit today oh look an inside check sure

[Music]

they're in cells there one deck

you guys are now two decks above where

you were before so the elevator when

asked break up to you're so pretty up

one level lawyer for or definitely a

good idea to ask and heels about the

president yeah you know there or what

they are the prisoners aren't above the

pilot is up above I'm taking you to the

pilot okay so I'm just gonna erase fact

that you've said that their prisoners

have you selling me otherwise they are

there are prisoners he just said they're

not above yeah oh you just said how many

we're alive I guess on that ship where

the boys are prisoners

get out mm-hmm well it's not important

right now I think we should finish

taking the ship I can deal with the

prisoners afterwards let's take out the

captain nails walks up to the doors the

door all of us there's another elevator

like that one here is all pilot I'm

gonna use a healing as we're going up oh

yeah this is before sweet helium how

much a minute I'm just reading the

messages I'm sending Tommy they mean

I've never I've never I've never

[Applause]

it's such a good time I should let me be

able to figure this out like I mean it

seems like you already know a lot well

know like what the [ __ ] is going on with

him well that's a good question

[Music]

everybody make our couch okay I'm gonna

think about my team oh that's so do you

know what yeah Wow magic yeah how the

sorcerer is correct how does sources

cast spells there it's like born into

them or something like that yeah good

luck news that's like a demonic

bloodline and there's a magic where they

get their spells from is not they don't

study they just a villain it's like it's

like he's not like Tony Stark nothing

you know Tony Stark is just really small

yeah don't start to make the Iron Man

armor because it's really smart he's

like he's like he's like scar which he

could just do stuff okay so so he was

there when a lion snapped and then he

went through the Maelstrom and now you

see so something has taken just taking a

dial inside nails and ratcheted up past

the other 90% of his brain yeah who's

there one Ryan Schneider Orion the

sweater

let's have to do it anything unless all

the magical energy was released and he

is somebody who has somehow gotten

magical energy through this being is

itself right but like what's what's up

with the [ __ ] personality though

that's just 30 is the sword takes that's

what I was thinking like this well there

you got make an inside check I'm going

to spend my last grit point advantage on

that and say where's my innocent

that is a 21 okay so you are a boxer

right and you were young and you are

smart and you were tough but there were

always people pulling the strings above

you mm-hm

and those people had more power than you

had and so you always could tell that

those guys all acted different right

they were assets they didn't care about

you all right

they didn't care about any of the

[ __ ] boxes right if they could have

they would rung you dry right because

they had more power than you right so

what would happen to you if suddenly you

had orders of magnitude more power than

any mortals in red how would that change

sweet Smith Mountain would you start not

caring about living creatures

[Music]

No well might be just that powerful and

you judge feels that way yeah I mean

each one of you would probably be

reactive yeah your city huh Neil's

reacts where I think it's a wear off

thing but more of a controlling thing

like you just got it right so like take

some time to Train

I am elevator or did we get like shipper

one floor headed up there all notes we

shopped channel so I mean it's this is

not this is like the you know the

solution maybe so I should be glad I

didn't make nails the lieutenant

[Laughter]

so yeah you guys what you nails talk

about the prisoners and you talk about

the captain staff you guys are on the

command deck you guys want to go to the

captain's day yeah I'm just

double-checking yeah we don't have to

fight these guys just if you're gonna

smoke them just smoke them and make get

it done over with or convince them to

join us we need recruits we're four

handed and the commander wants this ship

yeah extra short-handed after a little

somethin'-somethin in the blood X these

men have been taken by Ajax and they

will not turn for us why not if I just

turn for you

well what was left to them turned for us

why does Ajax have some sort of mind

power over though can you uh can you

snap Ajax can we like you snap that guy

is there an eraser it's probably worth a

shot

all right well I'm down nothing Elsa

Phil do you do you want to Dremel the

magnet on here here's a matter she's

very weak wait no no I wasn't - yeah

yeah just like she just did it so it's

like it doesn't sit flat yeah yeah when

I get my new one I think I'd want to

Dremel it in there a little bit cuz

there's a little bit to work with but I

also would mind if it went through and I

just stuck it and you can see the Ross

Osceola there's a big window cool this

was being held

Joey no no it's Scott not unless we took

do you until we told you there was no he

parked it next to it and there was a

unless I wasn't here with you said that

I may have been getting miniatures they

they haven't tried to pull away huh

okay so we're still people if they do

we're not man just told the whole on to

them gently

[Music]

this is basically the same dimensions as

the last room just smaller

[Music]

and there's a chair here with a warming

I'm going to switch out which guys are

the gift because I do not have the two

of these guys and there's a bunch of

these dudes are those kid yep okay just

making sure

yeah adults no souls no so what's that

guy then these guys are all gift that's

adorable

okay okay it's a [ __ ] that's a dark

door fizzy that one of the yes you are

no I'm other

[Music]

this is the element he's yeah he's

actually he's more heavily armored than

the spellcaster do you is we finally got

the line control fill this guy's

actually wearing plate mail so the door

is open on to a purple room that is

doesn't have any any windows and is once

again

looks like you're inside some kind of a

giant organ like there are veins and

pulsing and there is another one of

those pools that's much smaller it's

behind the chair there's a raised Shera

Dyess and there is a very tall get

Yankee leaning back in the chair of the

chair is reclined and as the door is

opening you see the chair like sits up

and they're these tubes going into his

head and the tubes pull out of his head

and he wakes up and these guys are

waiting for you pull out of his head

yeah you know like they're holes in his

head that [ __ ] it's gonna be initiative

yeah yeah else goes first again yeah

just give me one second flat if I were

my solid if I won more together

next is the AC stuff helping on the back

about yeah actually yeah having you guys

they see these rings can you just snap

them all that's fun right you like doing

that yeah these guys whatever else is

true these guys appear to be right all

the time is it in England right now

pretty late well it's like 5:45 a.m.

problem okay Google what time is it in

England right now 6:00 a.m.

close em 554 this is a guessing in time

zones 99 cents

let's just call him a copper to exact

Friday yeah he wants to record another

episode shame - he also wants to play a

cutie but he does have

yeah that's possible I'm at the point

where I could watch a game to look at

this one

so I'll just cancel the chain that week

well wouldn't be on Wednesday just to

have extra time to prepare frozen take

away you know the kids might be you guys

are tricky because so far you afford all

my attempts to engage you in content I

don't know what's gonna happen next you

guys want to go in the dungeon no save

the like but it's it's know you guys had

good reasons not do you guys have good

reasons to do all the signs pointed to

like this isn't the thing to do right

now there's other things that are more

pressing it's also interesting hearing

Jason this happened off camera here

Jason say I just don't think my guy

would go in there I'm like okay but you

were aware but like that means you're

never gonna be any other than a personal

warlock you don't know what levels are

you don't know what levels are but you

know that there's a difference you don't

there's a difference between the super

powerful warlock and it's cuz they do

[ __ ] like this all you do is just walk

around caster he just doesn't want to be

left behind

what you got nails I got a 11 sweet 20

19 judge 14 what you sayin else you got

switched it oh yeah so sweets is 11th in

King yeah alright nails

alright as soon as well actually right

you know we feel the elevator stopped I

turned to the commander commander do you

do you want to try employing your

diplomacy again we need somebody that

knows how to run this ship he knows how

to run this [ __ ] you don't think I could

run this ship all by yourself I can

already steer it there was a whole crew

that we're looking at mirrors with

images on it and there's multiple of him

though oh gotta remember yeah but how do

we know how long he's gonna have how

long he's gonna be techno destructive

let's try to keep let's try to not take

down their leader just knock them out

because we do need to figure out how the

wall guard below said he knows how they

found us some we didn't know how ajax

found us because we can't be half of

that happen wherever we go after this

mm yeah you can kill the rest of them

very well as soon as the doors crack

open almost as soon as you can see

anything in the room there's just a

bright orange flash of fiery light the

now signature nails blast of Tron by the

way uh like not only his nails ever cast

fireball before the nails from the nails

the nails drove lead all our enemies

back that's what we're gonna call him

when he's like this

inhales there's nails and nail strip

[Music]

29 damage to whoever failed it's a huge

gift dude it's in the was in the chair

the fireball you see it from the

fireballs like literally involved wool

like marble a fire that shoots out from

the nails his hand goes and then the guy

in the chair holds out a rod a rune rod

and it goes into the rod and he's like

he's like a pose what nails is done one

who spills storing and now it's covered

okay oh all that advantage chips are you

oh I'm gonna do I keep forgetting about

this I'm gonna use my standard barrier

their ability which is one so any senior

officer within 30 feet of me get

temporary hit points equal to money

level so five cool I don't know if King

is considered senior though is no okay

you senior to you lieutenant right

I think that's probably like he's he's

the new guy but sweet made him

lieutenant

so there's gonna be this kind of well

technically he outranks me but that guy

he's just he just got yeah I just got

here so my friend Scott so there should

be some kind of like Peru yeah I just

don't know what that would be like it's

up to you but he blows listen to my

sweet music but what you but you know is

when you hear that that means it's time

for battle and it gives you the sex

dress that's right that's right that's

right as ridiculous as that sounded this

is gonna work in that way that's what

gives you the bonus XP probably car plus

I have a points copper's trying its best

I'm sure I could do alright yeah if I

can do it you can do it oh that's my

action ok I will move a little closer

with picot 5 10 15 20 so you get

advantage so nails uh you stay inside

the elevator so you can get that other

go

[Music]

he has sorcerer stuff but protect us -

yeah if it's anything like a wizard

buggy is a sorcery point them but you

can burn source or points and say but I

don't hit these people sent like AoE

effects and stuff also winning hmm Oh

woody that's a good question

so what are we doing it's wider sound up

settling also the do√≠s guard manifester

is going when the battles over the five

hit points go away okay manifester who

can there's a through that Dumbledore

you know 25.5 mm-hmm I picked the wrong

this my Constitution is second only to

my strength

[Music]

I feel a lot of ones and twos [ __ ] this

Bell Jesus I think I thought it was a

five so it's ten eleven twelve this

fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen

nineteen twenty three half of twenty

three is eleven you take eleven points

of damage then you see you see Suites

features didgeridoo like they were

hugely popular ivory we're doing like

the world the ban them and stuff like

that there's I got a video using the

video here the hair like they're they're

blowing the Musel inside and there's a

dog that's just like any of shits on the

floor they make a really annoying sound

yeah no you have everybody in the

stadium doing it that's gonna this

buzzing cover that was the manifesto its

judgment right right right right

so I'm sorry

excuse me sorry a17 and hit the

Beauregard that is what you need to

honor those guys are all the Gorga is an

evil dwarf these guys are all getting do

these are rank-and-file gift that's a

super guy

stupid yeah this guy is a super gift

these guys are normal again so oh right

normal gift is a c-17 so you so I do 11

damage on my first attack I do three

this one is so I do 20 damage total with

my two attacks and don't call the guy

one unit 20 damage total sure one yes

[Music]

the people could see my notes there's no

rhyme or reason to how I Drive good

points sometimes I'm just adding up

damage sometimes I'm literally doing the

math to do the total doesn't make any

sense

give the purple marker hum Martin's

number one

I have this marker yeah we're on the

Prairie level we are crippled empty

sorry or the purple Hamilton

he's right market to that you all people

may give all people you of all people

would want to use the right marker for

the right level you look at the person

in color-coordinated everyone's thing

with their stuff look easy use fun I

love it I think this stuff's great I

love those little pictures on it I don't

know if people can see me they can't

they see I'm on that it's a couple that

is on the tech that's cold

alright yeah you you a cube you yeah you

use your lies fighting style and trick

them into thinking you're an attack

where you're not and then slicing yeah

play some nice actually you're the one

should be describing on your shoulders

and hey would I do that

be keep doing it well you because you

don't stop I will try to be better in

this in all things that was judge speed

up yeah sweet

[Music]

[Music]

how much damage did you do Anna if your

credit why here's the thing if that was

wrought of spell storing yeah madam

whatever he's got he's gonna blow us all

up

Oh cuz he can return it how it works

Davis if that is indeed what it was you

can take it home well he's going to take

opportunity attacks regardless of which

way he goes to get there which is a

problem no if he goes by this guy well I

got some ticket one yeah he's still

pretty injured and yeah my dudes look

like [ __ ] beat to hell just to use a

scroll do use a scroll do I have to have

a spell slot no no that's just for me

like right the only thing is it has to

be a style there this one for this one

before it has to be a spell that you

could cast fellas otherwise there's a

chance you spell failure I said if it's

not asked well you can always try to do

it but there's just a chance that not

only does Judge not know the spell judge

will never know the spell so now I got

the girl who is gone nails have gone

Pakistan that one demo I met now only

the best okay so another good all right

so I am throwing haymakers at this -

Wallace Wallace

yeah okay so one hits and I'm pretty

sure one misses this guy's number two

alright so number two takes 13 points of

damage and then as my bonus action I am

going to dig deep

I guess we need resistance to collagen

in your piercing slashing like

everybody's gonna actually like these

boxes are super actually I'm using them

they're rolling yeah

and that's it for me

[Music]

the three

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

this guy's been attacked sweet

Wow the guy that watt moved over there's

gonna tack nails nails as a c14 he

swings but I'm just I was waiting for he

swings and he hits twice but his sword

just sparks Arkansas outfit in Vincent

nails one guy on Phil

me yeah this guy the guy who just wheat

punched I'm sweet correct you're right

he's not backing you so he has a manager

3 to 10 10 plus 2x2 great 6 and 14 14

plus 4 is an AC 18 that is enough so he

knows oh yeah

[Music]

[Applause]

that's three this is deathless resources

what is that nine ten ten ten points of

damage for like a silver runic great

sword attack nails on the chalkboard

effect yeah anytime

it does rates or damage and to d6 Hester

look better than mine his answer was not

very satisfactory what I mean it's King

he's like those older sounds like go

ahead and make a deck save on number one

you need to make that 15 8 plus 2 is 10

it does as she takes 6 points of damage

this is number 2 or 3 now the sacred

flame 6 points

yep I think so this background say

quarter and you're not yep I don't give

up the ball tax

oh I forgot something that's right this

guy walks up here here he goes

he walks he walks [ __ ] your walk he

stands up he's fully I had taller than

the other gift and he has this rod and

he stands there and he looks at you and

his eyes glow brilliant yellow cone of

psychic energy goes to Isis and he uses

his psionic attack to Flay you guys so

make an intelligent signature who says

you might judge sweet nails

automatically next five ten fifteen

twenty twenty-five thirty yep that's

sixty feet long

okay Wow sixteen sixteen okay

[Music]

you fail to see cd14 do you succeed I

succeed good so he's gonna work is he

gonna burn through all he's ever done

through ten Charles so it's ten at 17-17

points of damage if you failed your save

that's copper eight points of damage if

you make your service

[Music]

oh and that's a bonus action I think

I've got some charges left

how you feelin sleep he we got a little

rod in one hand he does this with this

other hand basically like force pushes

you guys I need within thirty five ten

fifteen twenty five I need I need sweet

and judge to make intelligent sense 27

the judge just pushed back welcome back

and elevator and that is this guy done

its nails since these guys are in a nice

convenience cone the cast fear on it's

all good to me good old fear yeah which

is probably too short to pick up this

guy well I can cast that as a careful

spill and I make sure that it does not

target a sweet or big cat look at that

see he's still in spite of silver off

they're still useful to me since you're

still useful to him yeah so these guys

all feel they're saving throw and they

are terrified as I would be reckon I'd

be [ __ ] they are all terrified of

needles and on their turn they're gonna

turn around

Gobber okay the drug our manifesto is

still in possession of his senses yeah I

can still it up in there 17 I think that

hits 17 its yeah if you're attacking the

regulars if you're not attacking the

super gift yeah yeah I just demoed that

guy sorry

yep ac 16 US of A nine damage is super

gift feared yeah yeah only this guy's

now only that guy's not too excessive

attacking him 25 hit and not any more

damage

this is 18 total 18 total and then I'll

get off the tree

no they're feared they can't they can't

you know they're not gonna be cat kiddo

SiC them actually get that dwarf

get that Dorf

[Music]

my team five damage okay yeah ISM a

catfight yeah I mean he's wearing he's

wearing plate so it's mostly just the

tentacle just pounding into him right

and jarring him this is not a lot of

exposed flesh for big cats tentacles -

can you purchase on but he's definitely

strong enough to batter this guy into

submission giving a lot of time I'm

gonna try Keane I just might as well

okay okay not that's my bonus action so

the DC I know that is 15 yeah you're

able to get a bead on this guy

yeah you're able to be able to market

okay so I got one mark on them you watch

them you didn't move right yeah you know

we just watch this guy and you could

tell how he fights his weaknesses

that is copper and that was this guy's

actually actually um he's gonna make

this as hard for you people as possible

don't resist so how about here this is

dense SP this giant gaping void in space

opens up creating this howling wind and

darkness a gateway between the stars are

reached and infested with unknown

Horrors a sphere of blackness and bitter

cold a hunger of Adar well it's not the

hunger of nava dark no light illuminates

the area you are all widened it's also

horrifying you cold does dark region

counter the darkness it's magical

darkness are probably not

[Music]

that's this guy's turn okay and now it

is judge is a difficult terrain judge is

starting yes it is a difficult terrain

and you are starting in the you're

starting your turn in the area you take

this a rope that boys - thanks said no

saving for you just take the damage any

creature that starts its turn in the

area things 36-hole it was bitterly cold

in space and then I'm gonna grab hold we

use my option to grab hold of that hair

in my face that gets hanky that's over

by me yeah and I'm gonna use my well you

can't see him you're blind so how does

that work it's with disadvantage is it's

the same as him being invisible how

would you how would you grab in a

visible region may it's not admissible

fees within reach you you being blind is

the same as him being invisible you

can't see so so how does anybody make

any attacks what this is okay but this

doesn't have like a roll to hit you're

gonna have to make okay

you have to make like a basically a

melee touch attack so it would be the

same like this is not something you were

proof well you are proficient but it's

just strength instead of your tourism

so it's your strength bonus you're all

deep laying out your strength bonus

blustery so it's just to me well

actually can I use I can use my double

action to move like mine one will speed

what do you guys gonna do with these

might the Hungerford are drops the chair

is that is reclined what are you guys

gonna do with these gift well I got I'd

grab that stuff we need this yeah we

need to talk to that guy for sure cuz we

need to figure out how Ajax hunted us

down or what he told them yeah so unless

you're gonna try to recruit these guys

they probably bind them tank rabble it's

an egg rat wasn't it grab like the guy

that was attached that way you can

question them something I say copper

time up time up it's not a lot no I'm

just gonna ask cop he's really Bo

sure yes the time Danya whole thing is

unnaturally like inhumanly long thin

bones and has holes in the shirt yeah

they're a little like like pocket pock

marks where like somebody's they're not

like drilled in there like almost like

they're natural like but I mean are they

like like pimples or are they actually

like open holes they're they're actually

open holes that you can see down into

yeah 100%

what do you see when you look down in

there right she's his brain yeah okay

someone loved him and then I'm gonna ask

nails like he has the stunning how Ajax

found us

[Music]

it certainly can you you you were the

pilot of this ship are you not are you

hear him say yes yes I am the pilot is

he speaking coming no nails us try

assuming the else is translating

actually like nails can make it so that

when this guy talks you in your head

here this kind of very slightly delayed

translation he's giving you guys

radioactive all right I will I will I

will translate all up a Starship

Enterprise yes I am the commander now

[Music]

by what means we were able to find us

here on the Astro see the wizard

Martin Mort more team I do not know his

name appeared before us and gave us the

coordinates and what do they get out of

working for Ajax glory freedom well

freedom sounds to me like you're a slave

to Ajax you traded the Iliff ins for a

man

[Music]

you you answer the commander commander

didn't ask a question are you the slave

we were slaves but the wizard made us

free and what happens when you return to

Ajax without your ship this answer so it

seems to me that you have a choice to

make you either join us or you don't

at which point we release you and if you

make it back to Ajax he kills you if you

don't make it back to Ajax he finds you

and kills you and if you don't join us

we will kill you

I choose you can see this creature but

it's strangely like yellow skin and

these blemishes these brown blemishes

all natural all over skin as it musters

all of its psychic power and says I am

now on doing it like Nathan to whatever

[ __ ] hurt I need some health points

he's still alive I take this not as

juicy [ __ ] all about himself so be it

you see you see the guy like his flesh

Flay's off his body unravels almost like

like like a potato peeler is this

correct

and turning them into NEC organs and

bones and do you do that

just like like like a zookeeper

[Music]

damn it nails

alright so he's that if we want if we

want to keep this [ __ ] we got the

[ __ ] drill holes in our brains here's

the chair sit the chair

[Music]

I can I collect their gear and stuff

doesn't have is there any anything

special on these guys yeah absolutely

there's stuff he's got this true he's so

I mean these these weapons are magic

it's their psychic a bit to give you are

naturally silent it's Jax's their no

it's still a great sort i still silver

it's still a silver great sort the staff

is a rod it's not around a spell storing

its round of absorption so if it doesn't

it doesn't store spells in store his

spell levels mm-hmm right so he couldn't

use it to cast fireball because there's

no fireball but he was able to convert

the energy into it charges for assign

like abilities just like wizard or that

you would be able music to convert but

but yeah so there's some other rules in

there yes you're not going to sit in

that chair are you just thinking about

it does the burden of command weigh

heavy on you yeah but think of the

advantage that this ship would give a

company oh I am thinking of that

advantage it would be a good advantage

but we need more we need more command

eat more command don't you miss your

friend the old commander

yeah you surf the chain well did he not

yes I feel that you yourself made may

have felt that his untimely demise left

you uncomfortable in command is there

any kind of like gesture yeah there's a

gesture I turn around and with my open

palm placed towards the ground this dark

swirling mass appears almost as the

floor like melts into it and as it

swirls it rises it rises into this form

and that roughly the shape of a man

which materializes into field commander

red so you see emerging from this hell

portal rep the old commander resurrected

the problem is that he was dead right

and he still is dead

like his his his features are ripped

apart almost as though a creature has

been gnawing on him I'll guess he bone

you can see just like there's no job is

just a tongue you know and he looks

around wildly and he's his his vocal

cords start to strain you hear a voice

come from him from this sounds if it's

coming from a great distance like an

echo II well a says okay route has

mastered me and nails his eyes go back

to normal and he collapses on the ground

and that's what we'll pick it up next

week it's gonna be as the undead

commander which tries to obey his new

master oh but those are the new astral

apparently the defense Daniel's is power

okay you see nails his eyes go back to

normal in the collapses okay so pretty

standard Dean Dean nice that's right

activist pleased it's been one big

before they'll screw this entire session

hey you guys are within striking

distance of what you wanted which is the

[ __ ] see you folks next week

[Music]
