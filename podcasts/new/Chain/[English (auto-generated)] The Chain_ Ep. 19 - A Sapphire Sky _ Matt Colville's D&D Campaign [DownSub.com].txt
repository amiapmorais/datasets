good because you have to read this I

last

the words of the last temper are a thing

in Medora stuff that they what what is

about it hey what did you say he was

talking to us about ring well yes I

remember that Ward's of the lesson and I

said the [ __ ] Jay gauntlet was

missing from ring well oh maybe that's

what the Jade gauntlet does I asked well

to us yeah still win for that Leonard

okay well he did send you a letter he

sent to you like four years ago and you

found it in the [ __ ] yeah I don't get

information so what are the chain doing

right now I'm finishing putting my

clothes back ok yes because boots was

this is something I left out of the

campaign diary which was naked again

everybody I think discord was like when

they posted that drawing of like the

shambling Mountain Little Boots

yeah called it roots are helping get rid

of the mold with the town guard that

great so the town guard the princes

guard here

you guys are in Collinsville which is

the name of this part of the city it's

got two districts in it and it is print

it's the princes old territory much like

the pellet was and the guards for this

part of the city are the word which they

have this stylized scroll with the

writing on it as their symbol and as you

folks are helping the the guards clean

up one of the captains of the word a

dwarf a dwarf in heavy armor comes

around the alleyway and and sees his

people he knows and a whole bunch of

people he he doesn't know

and there's obviously the signs of a

battle once the once the ochre what was

an ochre jelly rustles mode yeah so once

the Russert mold is dead it's it's

there's still a lot of this furry red

matting all over the place and half half

dissolved bodies left around and the the

dwarf this point comes around the corner

he stops and says what the God's name

happened here is he wearing any kind of

insignia like you busy look apart of the

princes guard yeah he's worried he's one

of these guys a night of works yeah and

he's got kind of running around the

corner behind him and then kind of

pulling in short is haffley is also

wearing the garb of the word the Knights

of the word a Sun elf was loose in your

district for you commander the chain I

mean did you do this no the being we

killed did this a great fight was had

yes it described this being to me 10

feet tall solid gold skin wings giant

flaming sword lots of magic

does he speak truth yes I'm sudama's

show him your sword still got blood all

over ya you bled he bled light their

silver blood over here so yeah he wants

to know like like he doesn't he doesn't

know what that is that thing you just

described Jane what are you talking

about what chain the chain of Acheron

yeah then you see what chain no I do we

are

company soldiers now under the princes

employ under the na no we found you

lying Sean I would know if you were

Knights of the Prince the Prince huh

[Music]

this is a bit of a recent development

for us so you know don't feel bad he is

his lieutenant the halfling wants to

inspect the seal and if they're real and

who are you I'm George captain of the

word and it's a spendthrift and he

smacks to half list love my and the

halfling cut-ups staggers back and I

like having a lieutenant that's to look

up to me he wants to know what you folks

are doing what what are what are Knights

of the prince poor not the word doing

here

we were just traveling through and we

kind of stumbled upon this nonsense a

bunch of people in town were screaming

we went over to inspect it there was a

black dragon a black dragon we stopped

it the some of the other guards will

confirm that's because they have seen

they were there and they saw and they've

talked to people who saw was that were

the Knights of the word that had killed

the dragon no nowhere to be found

just this although the actual problem

was the son elf that we destroyed in the

alleyway so the son elf had

transmogrified a common citizen into a

black dragon our weapon master was

clever enough to just you know to see

through what was going on and and undid

the magic turned it back into a regular

dragon man

chase and [ __ ] him up well he's pretty

happy that you folks are willing to stay

and help with with the cleanup it's

gonna take a little while to kind of

break this thing down but then

eventually that nightsoil man will come

and start you know they'll bring carts

and they'll carted away he just wants to

know where you guys are like where

you've based out of if your Knights the

Prince like what district are you from

we're currently in these days looking to

establish ourselves somewhere in capital

yeah that confuses him in that kind like

the knight that's there no there are no

Knights of the Prince in the stays the

stays and he says yeah he'll say the

stays is the fulcrum and the gold

buttons yes and all buttons no chain no

chain and stays oh we're looking do you

unify the princess forces I don't know

if you've heard that's happened on the

pellet only one man can do that the

prince and thou art no Prince

yeah we're looking for the new Prince ha

he says maybe me like maybe keep looking

just do the thing that you said you were

gonna do like he thinks you're joking

they see me I like I mean that's fine

it's not a new Prince it none of the

ones you've met have no lady interview

waiting for one to just yeah yes like

she said they're waiting for the Privy

Council to know they're waiting for you

know the waiting for the war and whoever

wins the war

yes work for it at total work for a win

huh

sweet well then we're a traveling band

of knights and when there's things like

this going on in the princess

territories we hope take care of it

I mean he it's he's incredibly impressed

at your civic mindedness and he just he

just wants to know how to get in touch

with you like if he has any more

questions I said when you say that you

operate out of the stage that's what

confuses him because he he knows who

runs the stays and they're not

technically we operate off of our

[ __ ] yeah the [ __ ] well you can send us

a message at the Pharaoh's dream or to

our ship actually how do we give them

our address with your friend code and in

our name hey there's somebody like this

guy would not have a diplomat's like

normal

so yeah the Pharaoh's dream impresses

him because that's a that's a very

famous place and not and he's surprised

you can afford it

but he lets you know that his men his

men my fancy clothes I don't think I

sort of unless unless like I didn't have

you save or your clothes to see if you

Mo's would get burned so yeah that would

be especially expensive so we used to

play when a dragon breathed on you I

would have to take your care to shoot

and have all of your items save and that

was a great way to get high level

characters that had a ridiculous number

of scrolls and potions and to solve any

problem and just pour dragon breath on

you and they all explode or their

various ways to thin the I yes yeah

anyway so I didn't do that so I'm gonna

assume that you guys still have your

clothes otherwise he's just gonna make

sure his guys keep the spice they get

those place clean and they'll hold that

and I'd say he just wants to know where

you guys are gonna be in case he wants

to talk to you but you had night so you

have the princes seals so he and his

lieutenant verified so they you appear

to be authentic he's just a birdie

that's all so it's real deal how long

did that whole exchange take between us

I could between us cleaning up and

helping and all this well you know

talking to him probably only five

minutes he doesn't really have much to

say to you guys other than who are you

what are you doing

I mean maybe maybe it's good idea but I

would say - murder arrest here since

everybody's Burton so we'll ask him

what's uh what's the best place to stay

in town I mean there's the dancing

minstrel a lot kid sounds good to me

aboard mmm-hmm

[Music]

what's this area called again this place

is called you guys are in Kings Cross

which is a neighborhood in calling so

which is a district so in fact you have

your map on you the new Teddy the new

Teddy I think he calls himself own twins

so uh-huh okay I think I'm just trying

to see like how do i anyway so somewhere

on this map on away yeah really worried

we are the color coding I don't know

where they're I think I know I know

we're in a neutral destroyed balloon

right yeah we have I'm lost

that's why I'll go mess thanks got some

nice prepared get yourself a little

diary short more than any walked through

the woods versus B X so but he's scary

it commercial [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I can't sorry

I don't have something right uh you can

rob you're barely gonna be able to read

that I think I don't have my Colleen

sale yeah purses James Russell yeah we

got it

I used to this this table the speed

cloth does not right you are not the

pencil just one I didn't hear out of my

way Hey

yeah you guys can you guys can retire to

the dancing they'll show us a large and

spendthrift will give you directions on

I get there Thank You spendthrift thank

you it's a short road named night there

right if you want what time of day I'm

not sure I'm full huh it's a little

after noon oh okay so it's hot it's

right you're getting nothing it's

getting toward the beginning of summer

great a couple a couple of us a negative

Constitution we probably have to

something negative constitute right yeah

from the russet mold yeah you and judge

and I can take a night off for sure

booth sir we have an or is that [ __ ] as

they say I need to conjure up Oh diggin

he's still dead well here out of the way

I enjoy that thought that he might be

dead he's a nice time this time I won't

go campaign diary I can't let these

people know us and be funny if if

something else came out but it had

Odie's personality yeah I just had a

mini made I got Conger some view and

next time you conjure not maybe that was

some random point I'll come up with some

crazy familiar for which there is no

mini any like ah I gotta go find some

crazy custom-made thing I'll be like wow

anyway that would be incredibly petty

minded of me would you have any day I

would definitely do yeah

it would be the hardest possible meaning

to find yeah so the dancing neutral is a

three story you guys are in in calling

sales really an old part of the city and

so it's also one of the more built up

places and the sign of the dancing

minstrel is kind of a classic the it's a

fiddling dancing kind of

more medieval looking jester figure that

you would find in like the 11th century

and supposed to most of stuff in capital

which is a lot more modern the signs are

really old and there's a there's a lot

of people staying here there are a lot

of rooms and there's a bard in the

common room who is what who is no but

he's he's got he's a really tiny stage

only about this wide not that high off

the ground but he he plays and there's

the people who stay here are ryokans

from other parts of the city they're

typically here on business and they'll

spend the night here so it's relatively

well-to-do and there are unlike unlike

the inns in the stays even the princes a

footstool it's there's not like goblins

or anything like that it's it's all

humans and almost all the Marais Owens

and the innkeeper is happy to like

everybody when you walk in everyone

stops and but the the bard keeps playing

and everyone stops and looks and then

they kind of you're dressed as REO uns

so the bard starts playing a little

louder goes back to the business and the

innkeep is is happy to take your money

and give you guys rooms and asks if you

want anything to eat yeah absolutely

lava spots vanished they'll have he'll

have his sister bring you food if you

want to take a table there are a couple

of it's a huge mat it's a very large

common room it's large enough to fit

like 80 people here as opposed to the

princes footstool which is relatively

small mm-hmm and if you hear the only

gift and the only and so all these

reopens kind of middle upper

middle-class Romans are all desperately

trying to ignore you guys who you guys

are

there's you've got a giant cat it's got

six legs and two pinnacles people get up

from the table that you guys pick and

move that's good and you guys are free

to to you know enjoy the music it's

gonna cost you

[Music]

two gold apiece to stay here

alright that's pretty that's pretty

expensive Daniel yeah that's gonna

include that's that includes food for

tonight and tomorrow any booze yeah

absolutely lovely

new gold damn Rio and wine which is the

best wine in orden Dro drought wine is

very much not subtle and the wines here

are a lot there's a lot more many more

vintages and varieties and the taste is

a lot more subtle than the stuff that

you're used to okay sure absolutely

yeah so Wow while we're doing our along

wrist so I'm gonna assume that well I'm

assuming that maybe the sumac pole has a

a diplomat's pouch I think commander you

should ask you know write him a note

through your pouch and ask him what

these words mean or ask him if he knows

what these words mean good luck

yeah this is watch you struggle well

we've got a whole supply is a clue got

an idea

tell me to go get a notepad no just

pretend

dear Summa it's been so long since I

last saw you

preview think about you often do submit

pool what's this mean

yeah so you you write a note

what's I assume you explain what the

context of the doesn't have a lot of

place yeah you didn't so you you write

your note you put it in the diplomats

pouch

it doesn't usually disappear if there is

another yeah they have they don't belong

to anybody okay okay who is it what what

happened

angel I bet that's one person we know

that has one for sure what funny people

how long to Sherrow me Ajax utrom you're

passing notes now yeah hmm

[Music]

might be my favorite part of D&D is just

right yes simple person I told angel

nothing to you guys know you think I'm

funny it doesn't we have bits and bobs

for you before I rest I'll ritually

bring back before I rest my madness keep

cavorts and he could warts and capers

around your shoulders and yeah I mean

your hair and pulls on your ears I don't

really sleep anyway right I'm just in a

try are we hating

he starts grabbing your food okay we

noir Lodi how was it wherever you were

I missed you I unfortunately missed you

[Laughter]

so yeah nothing today it will pass up

you guys will be able to so basically we

just hang out in the common room

drinking you can't sleep and wake up a

good time not get smashed but actually

yeah we got share a room without there

I'm getting smashed Oh Oh do an

accompaniment with that board and improv

some sort of shanty about about how you

know how we killed the cycle guys ten

feet tall you just got to chop them up a

lot more house

minstrel I love this song he would just

super it in I wasted my 1:20 for the

night yeah your glory in battle Sangha

is not it's not he's not a great

minstrel leads mark but he's fascinated

by you folks and what happened one in

the city and he's read the he's read the

unlike George the captain of the word

the dwarf this dude knows who guys are

okay and so he's super keen to get your

exploits and he knows about his stuff on

the pellet and all that as well

he knows what's been in the broadsheets

she's a reporter the twelve Dragons yeah

yeah together yeah well yeah in fact

that's the the the broadsheets have

reported that twelve Dragons have taken

the columns they haven't because like

but yeah they haven't in terms in game

terms okay in game terms they don't they

haven't taken it until the end of this

game turn okay yeah they're right right

now they're just there no one challenges

them no one challenges them then at the

end of this game turned then they will

actually own it they own it

okay this makes a lot more sense if you

have played diplomacy which of course

all you folks have because you watched

the video I did on diplomacy

I don't watch actually long as this play

dip right yeah like one okay

just before you let the next day I

thought that someone not gonna do it as

you guys are having what should I read

first the phone or the paper uh the

phone the phone I understand what I'm

doing okay uh-huh yep yeah give or

something right

[Music]

okay asleep tanking

yes they're good we could pass more

notes did you smell doesn't such as or

the loss or truthful short phrase got it

got it

how is this really different and anyway

the title of tonight's episode is notes

actually what is you guys don't know

what the timeline I do know you might

owe to get alerts on the phone it but it

it didn't show that I was talking about

we're rolling dice and something and you

told me off last week flicking the tile

I did that's right I didn't look at it

it supportive really the spoilers the

title the Oilers because I was told off

so mainly there it's the only way no it

doesn't we let's see if my brain buster

nice I'm just trying no no I'm just I'm

I'm trying to figure out how to reply in

the spirit of the spell I know the

answer is I'm just trying to know I just

used the same paper that I wrote Wow Oh

No

have divination now so I use it you do

work basically like wheel whoa it's the

wheel woman you can ask more specific

questions and get like an actual

specific answer about your what you're

about to do the next 30 minutes no

because that's already it's seven days

oh and you can get better you can get

better answers you can get you can get

better answers but there are they can

there can be cryptic wait what is it you

make people tell the truth the GM offers

a truthful reply not necessarily the

truth but truthful that's me on the gym

it might be a short phrase a cryptic

rhyme you could choose that yeah yeah

cheese it cheese it oh I thought of a

better question darn used it too quick

do I own your question you've never cast

decision divination do you think well I

don't know if it's gonna occur within

seven days so that wouldn't actually

work so I'll stick with what I got are

we gonna kill a just be like no nah bro

I was gonna ask hoot as nails not want

us to trust that's gotta be right it's

got to be the changeling right okay so

changeling exploded

any of anyway yeah well god we're dying

with anticipation so so we all would he

wants to they want to know what you did

oh my god if this letter is going to

[ __ ] us oh sure armies now yeah yeah

that figured maybe get an idea of what

it is if we aren't delivering the bang

that says the fulcrum owns the chain

what did you God say Raven cannot break

the chain okay who's the oh the ribbon

is Barona not win arriving with a

message is their symbol is a symbol of

house perenna yeah a nice thing about

pigeons sorry pictures of messages ah

I've got my Birds mixed up so the next

morning while you guys are preparing to

leave maybe you're gonna get some food

somebody walks in it's a lot there are a

lot fewer people here in the early

morning this is mostly a place people

have lunch and dinner a gentleman walks

in a young man walks in and he's dressed

like a Roman century this is those of

you who are from this world would

recognize this as being the outfit of

somebody who was from a Commonwealth and

was probably like in the military in

some capacity and he is he orders a

drink and when he gets his drink he

comes to your table and gestures to a

chair as though asking to sit down have

a seat might you be

before my name we I am not mistaken this

is the chain of Akron how could it not

be he says how could it not indeed it is

recently almost the victims of a black

dragon attack almost victims you solved

that problem then a couple of more a

couple more the next uh later that day

indeed pleased to meet make your

acquaintance

my name he gives you his name his name

is Marcellus

Scipio glorious battle it was boots sing

him in a song Marcellus this guy looks

he's he's he he looks older than he is

he has this is this bearing of somebody

who is it kind of looks the way you

would expect a noble to look ideally and

but he once he starts talking he seemed

he's probably only twenty but he's got

one of those faces that's got pretty

black lines and it waited yeah exactly

he's got one of these kind of he's born

preternaturally old like some people are

youthful throw the whole life this guy

was old early right and and he takes a

drink from his any he want its

introductions he's I says I've heard of

you I've heard the broadsheets

but I don't know which one is which

obviously you work on the handsome one

away he says have you read the

broadsheets recently oh yeah

okay so everyone's wondering it

everyone's everyone everyone's like

wondering how you got how you got a

displacer beast

um like did you raise it from a pup I

did yeah tiny little thought you said it

was a cat it is a cat but I but I raised

it better than most people do so I don't

know

I think it think at least I mean I don't

know see he just wants to know which

ones which

like it's not sure which ones judge are

you judge or and your king I'm King King

judge boots slim oh man with the boots

I'm 11 master of the chain

since my commander wouldn't be so kind

as to introduce me I'll introduce myself

I'm leach the surgeons and this is Odie

ah

the surgeon yeah excellent excellent he

says fascinating so I wondered and he

looks to King and says do you think he's

really invincible not at all I agree how

would you describe the events that

happened to you yesterday mm-hmm pretty

normal average day average day for the

chain hmm and this guy thing happens too

often not as much in cities but non jobs

you dealt with it you dealt with it

pretty handling what what if you don't

mind my asking obviously you're not

under any obligation tell me that were

effectively strangers for the moment but

what contractor he's currently under who

are you this is my my name is Marcela

Scipio and who are you with I'm

currently a student at the War College

mm-hmm he does have notepad with him see

you know he's not a reporter hello he's

dressed he's dressed in like two years

old yeah like a kind of a commander's

outfit he's just a kid okay

we're not currently under contract in

the city not in the city correct

but you've been in the broadsheets a

couple of times and I think you told a

reporter that you were here looking for

allies to fight Ajax correct a wife

killed our previous commander ah and

this is what happened in black bottom

correct

excellent excellent and is it is it Ajax

that you want or is it his wizard how

would I respond to that he takes a drink

he goes thank carefully just thinking I

think it's a total girl doing the why

not both yeah yeah yeah like have to

come up with one he said he liked yeah

well for instance let me pose you a

hypothetical this is this is the type of

thing we do in the War College all the

time although usually not on this

subject

suppose that mortem died of old age

it's a would you consider your contract

no and therefore you would have no

interest in Ajax and he would be free to

wreak his evil across the world that's

assuming we have a contract to kill this

wizard well and assuming that we did it

would make the contract no correct so

that would release you and you'd be free

to do whatever you want didn't you no

longer have any interest in Ajax

so-called invincible the likelihood of

his wizard dropping dead and seem very

low I agree I'm just trying to figure

out what your motivation is is it

strictly just to complete the contract I

mean playing with a lot of what-ifs and

a lot of like distant what-have-yous I

mean sidebar he killed the commander

rogue has a soul [ __ ] that guy yes he's

a he's definitely on the list like we're

not going to accept jobs on his side

we're definitely gonna accept jobs if

there's jobs that want us to do harm to

him 100% yeah so question is what do we

what do we want to say to this kid right

what what business is wife like well how

are you how are you gonna we're sitting

around a table how are you gonna express

that

you can just decide to him directly what

business is this of yours to ask all

these questions yeah well it's good

question I'm surprised you didn't ask it

earlier you know I've been I'm a student

of war and diplomacy my father sponsored

me into college and we have a long

tradition of public service in my family

and family yes your father yes well my

grandfather well-known oh yes who he

named says there there they if somebody

if like you know somebody who is from

this part of the world knows the Scipio

family they're famous like generals in

the Commonwealth army so boots might

have heard might have heard of this of

house Scipio but they're not really

this guy's not real and he's like Greek

that's 9 min or what is this you might

say that you might say that it is

something like a school assignment yes

I just I'm happy reading the broadsheets

and reading about you folks as your

reputation grows I'm happy to find

people that seem to have the same

interests that I and my friends do but

I'm just curious as to whether or not

that's a coincidence or purely a matter

of something written on a piece of paper

or whether or not it's a genuine

interest to seems to have the same yeah

I mean so well you don't seem to lack

for jobs but Ajax is no friend of ours

yeah not a difficult question to ask

Ajax has enemies all over the world and

he has made an enemy of the chain I'd

like to introduce you to some friends of

mine ring ring ring yeah

is he wearing like the old school ring

or not because he's still technically a

student he is he is not wearing the

first of all he doesn't attend the

Academy Military Academy he's going to

the War College he's going to like he's

going to Yale yes he is not going to and

then inside Yale there was a thing

called the War College he's not going to

West Point

that's not his thing I want to do an

inside check to see if this guy watch

chat like people in chat are four weeks

they're like little insight insight do

you know do you want to roll it or

should I roll it what's your insight

bonus plus seven plus some Wow really

base that's wisdom based yeah and I'm

proficient in it yeah you're mr.

charisma he's mr. the kid was yeah see

which one you use in today pre roll 17

plus 7 all right what do try to figure

out I'm trade-off this kid I get that

but yeah to see if what he says is seems

genuine like he's seem like he's asking

about Ajax has he given anything away a

bit weird for somebody just walk up to

and start talking about this stuff

that's obvious inexperience you guys

haven't had before so there's something

weird going on with this kid yeah he's

acting like somebody who's got this

secret that he just can't [ __ ] wait

to share with somebody right and so he

like he's got a present he wants to give

it to you but he's Anderson is a dagger

there it's almost like well like

someone's like like I said he's like 20

and so he's obviously been saying her to

ask you folks some questions but he kind

of wants to tell you what's going on

regardless of what you say so he's so if

we butter him up a little bit he might

be willing he's a kid he's a he's a he's

a college can't wrestle or I find that

when I just let people talk yeah you

want us to mute this game a drink loosen

him up it's got one right now yeah well

it probably have to be in person if you

go folks were willing to take a short

journey very short journey you're in

this district yeah

actually yes mr. streak in fact we

wouldn't even have to leave the that's

convenient this meeting take place so he

asks judge he says forgive me but where

are you from originally alloy yes yeah

okay yeah not not not to put too fine a

point on it l well who's asking

well my name is Marcellus Scipio come on

a student at the War College okay that's

right as you know it's alloy now let's

see what happens he said and he takes

his ring off and it's a band of solid

sapphire mm-hmm and he puts it on the

table and he spins it with his finger is

he causing a small right now uh what is

judge thing it seems like he's doing

something he is doing something cuz he's

he's obviously that's the tool that's

know this is your short journey word

about to go I know like verbal or

somatic

her of it he hasn't said any isn't any

hasn't or this but he did take the ring

and oh yeah see you're finally away

what's the matter a semantics is hand

gestures obviously I'm gonna cast

counter spell because it doesn't have a

verbal or a material component is just

so Matic I think I'm gonna slam my hand

down on the sapphire ring and stuff what

are you doing looking at the sapphire

ring is what triggers the effect and the

the group of you along with this kid are

now standing in another world

mmm

and he snatches before the ring the ring

is like hovering in the air and he

snatches it out of the air and he puts

it back on his finger and the you guys

are on it's kind of reminds you of one

of the little pocket universes you were

in when you went to the this is like you

guys been to the astral sea and then you

went into the Underdark I just realized

this this is like one of the probably

most multiplanar campaigns I've ever

relgious not on purpose by the way we've

been other places I guess probably

correct like you guys medallions yeah

but this the first thing you notice is

that the sky is appears to be like solid

sapphire like there's not blue sky it's

like gemstone it's a giant gemstone

stretching across from Horizon to

Horizon and there's a green hills and

there's a Tower of tall you guys are

right outside this tall thin white tower

and Marcellus

Scipio this Centurion of the

Commonwealth says I have some friends

I'd like you to me well we're here now

wait I hope you're not he pushes having

it show he's it you're not alarmed are

you don't touch him I apologize I don't

mean to be overly from here now that

we're here to tell us about your friends

well they're right inside Bobby where

are we uh this place is called the

Sapphire sky or the Sapphire realm I

think she calls she yes it was one thing

at a time

mmm and so as you the the tower this

tower is huge it's probably like seven

levels based I and you guys are right

outside it and there's a courtyard

outside the you folks are in the hills

of green hills stretch out to the

horizon and there is a wall around the

tower work inter planar yeah Oh

something weirds going on we went for a

redress yeah

some flavin amounts of to many people

but he doesn't know you guys have buddy

goes yes don't please don't be alarmed

this is this is what you might call I

don't know what I what the one of

laypersons term for us but this is a

kind of pocket realm I mean that wasn't

bluster man like that's a pretty normal

day for us yesterday so you know well I

know a little bit about about the chain

I know that you I know that you served

in alloy for a while but they haven't

told me everything anyway please follow

me and as you walk in so so uh what tell

me about the the Sun elf that you folks

bought and there there are guards human

guards that open these large double

doors and you folks walk into this tower

I think we should wait to tell anything

further until we meet whoever you want

us to meet so we have to repeat

ourselves I don't see the harm to tell

them about the Sun elf that's how we got

here in the first place

how is that how we got here in the first

place I knew that we'd start answering

to be honest I mean I he was wreaking

havoc on the city i rift together a song

about it yeah using the song didn't just

start going on you know he's had some

whiny god but I'll try and like just you

know scramble out a couple of bars as

best I can remember

[Music]

did the you don't happen to remember if

racket if the Celestials said anything

to did he actually don't tell me don't

tell me

well there we have folks to me so the

inside of the tower yeah that's what he

said was oh there's a lot of people

working in this tower town of what you

expect to see you know wizards tower

right and there it's much like the stays

it's very multicultural there are a lot

of elves in here and various other

beings are like there's a fire kasi in

here there are no there are no tea

flings you notice but yeah there's a lot

of it's there are libraries and you're

led to a lit up long spiral stair

and Marcela Scipio apologizes for the

climb says we can jump from one realm to

the next but stairs and eventually

you're in you're led to a large room red

the walls are red the floors red there's

many people here doing research it's the

walls have bookcases on the library and

the first thing you notice is if there's

a raised is a large pool kind of like

the pool you guys jumped into in the I

mean that yeah that looking and hovering

above and behind the pool is a figure

that looks a lot like the Sun a human oh

okay

except this one is silvery opalescent it

doesn't have wings as white hair its

eyes are closed and a and it's just like

meditating hovering in the air above and

behind this large pool which it sells

sunrays to Dyess

and there are wizards or sorcerers or

whatever in here doing doing research

taking large tomes off of out of off the

library and you folks kind of apart from

the fact that you're a drow and a gift

and a tiefling you fit in like there's a

lot of crazy races here including a orc

there's an orc

that Marcela Scipio calls out to and

this or is a not a half of work he's a

orc and it looks seems old old orc has a

very fine needle thin tusks that jut out

of his lower jaw and he's wearing a bone

breastplate that has a gold dragon

painted on it and the Dragons kind of

curled up almost like a Chinese dragon

and sort of does my voice I apologize

and Marcella Scipio calls out and the

orc turns around and says aha it worked

and Mark Marcella says I was I was very

persuasive and this orc strides forward

in extent

as hand king commander of the chain of

Accra

pleasure to meet you my name is Darren

Garvey silencer silencer this Mars ma

Scipio says but we call him da by all

silencer it's a title I am guess I'll go

ahead and say that no more daring gar

vile silencer Oh Aaron Garza orcish

named Darren gar violin slicer a violin

violin slicer vile silencer yeah about

yeah and this uh this area is about what

uh

sapphires are in their own what urine

yeah that's on sapphire sapphire realm

yeah the sapphire realm is what he said

she called it when she doing he says she

is we think he's referring to the silver

side of ring above the pool I mean

that's that Marcellus will tell you he's

like oh yeah absolutely

slim yes swim yes yeah that that is that

is the our benefactor and the benefactor

of and the architect of the Sapphire sky

and the creature up like is it stronger

weaker well I mean then the one we just

killed the the orc looks at you and says

nowhere near a strong but you were lucky

the orc says you were lucky the creature

that you fought was mad if it had what's

about it it would have made short work

of you but if it had it's what's about

it wouldn't have attacked you in the

first place

sorry who have brought you here under

such unorthodox circumstance but I think

we have a lot to talk about it might

have been fate but it was you that the

Sun reflecting off a lover's eyes met

when it escaped ring well and so is you

that we have brought here to speak to I

think you may have a lot of questions

and we have answers this is the tower of

the moon he says so this is like a a

moon celestial well done

well that I shouldn't be surprised that

a gift would know such things I'm sure

this pocket universe doesn't even faze

Slim I mean he's power like he's been to

many world like soon that pole has his

own little like it's on the pocket

universe it's mold in that universe

but yeah if you guys have questions

these guys can answer them and the org

this old orc with this bone white armor

it says welcome to the resistance the

organist Ajax starts here I've read a

lot about you don't you

well Marcellus has brought to me the

broadsheets nonsense and this orc is

speaks in a very civilized man does not

happen does not have any kind of often

orcs have a hard time even speaking

common because their jaws are shaped

very differently mm-hmm but this one

seems very civilized what drove the Sun

elf mad that attacked capital we don't

know but it may have been the price it

paid to be sealed within ring well for

eternity why would it want to be sealed

there the Sun elf that you met this is

gonna be a long speech Marcellus can you

get us food and drink and he says I

think they already ate this is over who

had have you broken your fast

yeah but you know ya wouldn't say that

if nipples would be appreciable yeah so

Marcellus all go and grab you guys when

they have a there's a large table that

has a map of Orden carved into it it

doesn't it's not magic or anything it's

just a cool table and they sit across it

and the whole time there is this moon

elf hovering in the air over this large

pool just meditating as people are

walking by and doing magical research in

here and the orc sits down kind of and

what was the question you had about

why did it want to be trapped in ring

well yeah well it was a lie of the of

the last emperor of Octavius Maximus a

good friend of octavius's and it

volunteered to be interred within ring

well and act as a seal you see I think

we now have discovered where ring well

is and as many suspected it lies within

Capitol in fact I think it lies in the

district that young Marcellus found you

in in fact I think you were very near

the entrance to ring well and entrance

and that's good news for us and also bad

news you have many questions but we

brought you here for answers ask what

and we ever heard I don't I don't

remember ever talking about the ring

well like we talked with us about it all

about it because we were asking about

the jade hand and stuff and he was

talking about it being and ring well

what is ring well while you're asking me

the work says you get my answer I

believe ring well was dungeon that

Octavius max Maximus cleared out when he

was a young man well before he began its

adventuring career and ascended to

Emperor and when it came time for him to

seal away his knowledge and the power he

had accumulated he went back to where I

started and used ring well so it's

actual origin remains a mystery it's

famous only because it's the place where

Emperor Maximus buried his wards hmm so

this until this guy with the he was the

Emperor of the Commonwealth the caelian

Empire also ancient yeah justice this is

this is like 1500 years ago it was an

empire of man as the last Empire man

like the common language that all these

people speak is the caelian I see right

capital was the capital city of his

empire gotcha

so you believe Ajax is breaking these

wards and taking them I believe he would

like to we were misled for awhile we

have recently learned that the jade hand

was not in ring well so we had been sent

on a merry chase for a while

but if Ajax knew where ring well was I

should say when he finds out where ring

well is and then he will muster great

forces to take it and the things within

which means we have to act quickly so to

take those things within yes before HS

go the emperor's Ward's span a vast

catalog of lore and artifacts my little

piece of paper oh oh it did so words um

yeah angel has it we sent you gonna say

what you get it's like if I remember the

wording exactly when when the creature

touched me before it died it said these

words mm-hmm the forbidden says fail the

seals were broken well that makes

Emperor must restore them yes well uh no

I think probably the Sun reflected

wasn't aware of and that in that

Celestials eyes probably only a few

hours have passed since ring will have

been sealed minh did not understand the

gulf of time that separated him from

blastings he remembered so he probably

was trying to find his friend the last

emperor who's been dead lo these many

centuries hmm and he said that the that

the seals had been broken yes

what does that well and he looks over at

the moon elf who does not is not a week

as far as we can tell it looks back and

at this point Marcella Scipio the young

the young Centurion is now sitting at

the table and he's brought like grapes

and stuff like that and and and fruit

juice and he's the orc vile silencer

says the way off star wars the question

this man asking ya about they said that

the seals the Emperor knowing that the

his Empire was collapsing and fearing

happened to his knowledge and the

artifacts he'd collected he sealed them

in ring well but he had very powerful

allies one of whom you met the the soul

our celestial and they did something

very clever they sealed the wards

not only from the world but also from

memory hmm which has caused us quite a

bit of bother trying to discover what is

locked within we think we know and the

elf was one of the power sources that

kept the forbidden psa's power so now

that's that elf is gone yes the

information about rain will begin

leaking out the world the things that

they accomplished will become undone we

don't know exactly what's in ring well

but we're gonna start finding out we

don't know who broke into it it's very

it seems very unlikely to us that the

magic would fail after such a short

period of time it's only been fifteen

hundred years so what was the Jade hand

then the Jade hand was in the Pharaohs

possession and was previously in green

well no that was a mistake on our part

hmm

again the what the the the Sun reflected

and some of the Emperor's other allies

were able to remove the memory of these

items from the world at their history

their existence and so we've had to

operate off of mostly conjecture to

discover what these things were so when

the Jade hand appeared we thought ah the

emperor is honest and many people

thought that or the Ajax is on his way

to collecting the warts but it turns out

that the Jane hen is not one of the

words so how did that thing get out yeah

we don't know or something you broke the

seal that bled him out it's possible

that they always van now it's possible

they disintegrated now sure that seems

very unlikely to us he looks over to the

moon again doesn't react but we're

hoping you can find out I do you think

he broke from the seal in capital and

that's why I was in capital yes sacking

people yes no not yes as I said not only

do we think ring wells and capital back

now we're certain of it we think we know

approximately where in fact we think

that our Ranger friend could probably

find it he went back to the place what

was the first incident oh I first saw

the dress the mold dragon was you know

we have Oracle's and they're very

powerful we have powerful magics but

nothing beats a light vendor his nose to

the ground if we're able to locate the

entryway entering well in this district

and capital are you able to obscure it

from others who would grind for this

information we don't know it depends on

how the seals have failed and who caused

them to fail it might be that it's

impossible to it we don't have the power

to do what the Emperor and his allies

did 1,500 years ago hmm but we may be

able to repair the Forbidden TSA's could

you not just destroy it

destroy the entrance but not without

breaking it like if there is a door hmm

and we destroy the door hmm I just

leaves an archway that anyone can enter

or exit there well how do you get there

I mean I could take it you don't know

good I know I'm curious if you knew even

if it's just another court or if it's

actual Oh as I said it's a dungeon so

it's like a physical place yes in that

world oh okay so it's not like another

pocket demand within the mundane world I

see so it's just a dungeon underneath

capital yes yes just to be clear you've

called yourself the resistance but who

against against in this instance

currently Ajax is the greatest threat to

those the oaths of opposing evil with me

I see and who swore you to those oaths

he turns and gestures to the window it's

pale white light glitters off ripples in

a pool that's her name

yes so is the goal here to recover the

wards of the last emperor and then keep

them safe we were sort of hoping that

they might be deployed against Ajax

sounds good to me

yeah something we don't know what's in

ring well it's a combination of lore and

artifacts some good some evil

we think the sword of a million years

might be held within we think this

prismatic scepter might be withheld with

it we don't know these do sound like

things that might defeat Ajax well some

are good and some are evil there was a

sort of a million years it sounds pretty

what should I mean what should we do if

and when we are to stumble upon this

entrance to bring well sounds like he

wants us to go in yeah one thing we need

the thingy even recover yeah I'm brought

here there are possible you may be able

to reseal it but without sunlight

reflecting where would that power come

from we don't know we don't have a map

of ring well the lore of it was the

Emperor and his friends did an excellent

job of obscuring the existence of the

place to business nature if we were to

get a hold of all these artifacts and

this lore and bring it here to the

resistance and use it to defeat Ajax

that kind of negates the I found here

negates the necessity to lock this stuff

away from Ajax Maya we've got he's not

even a party's always evil hey the orc

hold his hand up and then Marcella

Scipio leans forward and says someone

else will be searching for them Ajax

wants them yeah so it may be the

they'd be better off destroyed who knows

you ain't bound to one of my they may

already be ahead of us hey Jax's allies

within the city may be the reason that

the seals failed yeah it seems diesel

found it broken in Rouen and that's how

the elf girl kind of makes sense do you

know who his allies are in the city

we've heard rumors they're very well

protected against our Oracle's but we

know that they use shadows ones that

come to get you list

what was that reaction I had a an

encounter with a handful of shadows that

that attempted to assassinate myself and

a contingent of our men in an inn in the

stays and what do you remember about

that incident just that there was a

window broken in the common room it

appeared that one of the guests had been

killed and turned into a shadow which

then subsequently killed other guests oh

yeah there was an iron bar on the floor

when you say that Scipio and biosigns

are look at each other and Scipio smiles

and vile silence the vile silence or

sentence we think they call themselves

the black iron pact black iron packed

good juice what a galette excuse and

they are allies of AJ how much do you

know about Ajax well we know that he

went to be War College yes yes I know

they went to the War College and

attended there and I believe he

graduated top of his class with who did

he go it was Alvaro yeah

they graduated together apparently well

things have advanced somewhat since he

graduated well obviously we killed good

king omen he got

Mandrake to betray him and the Dragon

Knights yes it was all in Valeria yes

yeah

he's defeated the Pharaoh and taken over

the place he declared himself a saint

yes yes yeah he calls himself the iron

saying the black iron yeah we don't know

where he gets his power from at least he

Scipio and I do not know mm-hmm is she

gonna wake up anytime soon how she yeah

how she and all of this this is her

realm

she can't uh you keep looking to her for

answers well she's communicating

telepathically

yeah what's what's her connection to to

this to the mundane world to bring well

to to the resistance the Knights of the

Golden Cross are sworn to their her

Knights we were sworn to oppose evil

wherever we find it okay and right now

that means Ajax she created this realm

the Tower of the moon is her tower she

stayed behind when the others left who

were the issues her kith and kin the

other Celestials I don't know how well

versed you are at history your Chronicle

goes back quite a ways it may even have

it may even have law pertaining to the

Senate

but when the rest of the elves went to

live with their God in Arcadia she

stayed here and she can't leave Capital

she won't tell us why hmm technically

we're still in capital mm I see the

sapphire realm is nested within and

concurrent with the city okay

you also notice that this dude has a

sapphire ring on fine evil

just getting a bunch of brain teasers

tonight he says uh cruelty selfishness

questing for power with no limit hmm

there's a list of gods I could I could

rattle off any of all any serving any of

which would count willingly knowingly or

unknowingly hmm so she stands against

Ajax because because Ajax is evil and

the power whatever the power source he

has is something that opposes her it's

not my place to say but the Knights of

the Knights of the Golden Cross quest

across the world stamping out evil cults

where we find it it just happens to be

that Ajax is the biggest problem

so is Ajax eat yes the orc says how do

you know maybe he has some grand vision

for this smelly world what does the one

have to do with the other

perhaps his vision is for the good his

vision is the world awash in blood hmm

I'd be in charge of a world that is

destroyed that doesn't make any sense

is he mad not yet

I mean have you seen how he dresses

who else is part of your resistance well

everyone here are the Wizards and

archivists that work in this in the

tower we have agents in the city we have

agents across the world why work with us

we're not so we're no Saints no but you

stopped they solve the problem of the

black dragon which is the sunlight

reflecting powers so enormous

that he was able to reach into that

Dragonborns distant ancestral heritage

and pull from it and the dragon that

founded it likewise

mmm he is able to magic around him

spontaneously manifests into a shrub

what does that mean long ago in history

conceived under a tree

he takes what you said seriously and he

says the Celestials have the power to

create life to create entire species

it's possible that that the elf that you

met is responsible for creating the

awakened plants that we experience in

our world

he may have authored them will end in

his madness he was trying to do the same

thing again well we're interested in

this job but being a mercenary company

we do have our contract to kill mortem

as you know and we are a named capital

working towards said contract so in

order to take this job we need some sort

of compensation that's going to help us

further that goal which sounds like also

furthers your goals we're not really in

the business of paying people the right

thing why are you talking to mercenaries

then well we weren't intending to hire

you with coin but it was you who stopped

the dragon in the mold and killed and

stopped the mad elf and was you I

believe who can find the entrance to

ring well that is your value to us and

your hatred of Ajax certainly sounds

like there's power down yeah what can I

pose fulfill our contract well we just

want to like we can it's honest the

payment doesn't have to be monetary

items but assistance in doing our

previous contract is more than worth

doing this I think yeah

for tat yes it might also just be

generally useful for the world for these

very powerful items to be split up and

managed by multiple different people who

keep each other in check versus all in

one place together where a single

individual might be able to find them

and then use them for evil or because

they were Orca shaking set as judge says

that and since our immediate goal has to

be stopping Ajax from recovering the

emperor's warts yeah any other world the

the what is done like I'm more so

talking about we just uh you know you

most likely want Ajax Wizards dead as

well

and that's something we need to achieve

so we would if we help one on into this

stuff in ring well will you help us kill

Ajax's wizard

yes that's basically yeah yes both sides

uh-huh teach him that teaching the dance

yes the moon elf opens rise Hey

and she's hovering over this pool

doesn't have wings is it not so learned

celestial she's a lunar celestial and

she descends she hasn't touched her feet

don't touch the floor and she kind of

hovers over and her eyes look like the

surface of the Moon there of these like

you know white with dark craters across

them and both everyone everyone in the

tower

everyone in this floor of the tower

stops what they're doing in watches and

she this doesn't happen

area and bile silencer incipio both

stand up like head attention and she

moves and stops and looks at judge oh

and opens her mouth and it sounds like I

don't know if any of you've ever heard

this before it sounds like someone

taking a wet finger and rubbing it

across a wineglass mm-hmm

and the vial silencer

and turns to judge and says you are the

first member of the Order of desecration

I were to step foot inside the Tower of

the moon many members of your order and

past would have fought and died to

attain our sanctum I hope we have not

misplaced our trust in you do me a favor

and make up with no safe if Asmodeus

tells you you have an interest in this

place than I would imagine you would oh

[Music]

there's no such thing what sure what's

the result

what seen that here is no such thing as

a [ __ ] on a circle yeah oh not corny

so it's just 20 yes okay so you have

this feeling of you didn't know it

before but there was like this engine

running in your mind all the time and

all of a sudden that engine kind of

winds down and you have this experience

of clarity and you remember everything

that happened in a lie you remember your

family you remember the fall of alloy

you remember becoming a a member of the

order of desecration and joining the

chain and everything that's happened

since then and then the moon elf speaks

again and that wind chime glass

screeching voice and the orc says your

grace I'm sorry to have doubted you all

out this once and then the moon elf

retreats and goes back to the and the

other like I was waiting cradles right

yeah

your friend is a Marquis of hell this is

not news to you I am sure the mile

silencer says but your friend drives his

power from the antithesis of our patron

[Music]

mm-hmm well he doesn't know what he's

doing with it anyway so well does that

not make him your enemy as long as

George serves the chain no well when

someone joins the chain they leave their

past behind isn't that right judge

mm-hmm a little more convincing

Marcellus Scipio looks at the orc

and says the order of the Golden Cross

has been known to turn a blind eye to

people's pasts before and while silent

don't work just smiles well you don't

need to do that with me in fact let me

tell you about my past and all the great

things I have done I think we can do

that after we deal with this potential

open door yeah well we have a salty

house to celebrate it's 8:31 take a

break counts sing it in the song he does

say that that this is not the first

drought to have come here and you're

another first gift mm-hmm but you are

the first Yankee okay but our order has

no we have no historical prejudice

against either you or your kindred

unlike oh you can get it's talking to

slim and in in as an example of as

opposed to some people your folks are

probably fine so we're gonna take a

break we'll be back about 13 minutes -

we don't know where we lost Lars Larsen

gun

yeah we cast invisibility oh yeah

welcome back I think it was a stamp for

the commander and a minute okay you

don't have to yes true of course I don't

I could I could just cap it all if I

want you Wow do whatever I was wait stop

you at some point

I don't know when soon ish I'm gonna

take a real actual break from be IMing

for a number of weeks because the

culture of the time from is not one of I

run every week for months on end until

my brain explodes and also try to run

this crazy [ __ ] company what I'm used

to is I run for two or three months and

then you take a break and recharge your

batteries and then you play other games

or somebody else runs and that may

happen I don't know and I don't know

when we're gonna take that break would

have been today have you been up to me

but that's gonna happen sometime in the

near future I'm just warning you folks

now and then we will come back and we

will continue and we will pick up the

story where we left off so right now I

think it's mostly just trying to find a

good break one of the things that kind

of blows our minds is that people make

stuff and send it in and there's

incredible fan art and actual crafting

and stuff like for instance Kevin nuyen

I believe is your name I'm not trying to

start this letter well you started by

saying gosh I just ER I know he's don't

letter so depreciation format and M CDM

and Kevin made this dope stamp which I

love and we have stamped on stuff it's

the stamp of the chain it's really cool

like I'm it is real like everybody oh

yeah boots you know now you have entry

[Music]

and also kevin painted a super-nice are

really cool do you want to put yeah

let's put it out here cuz it's got boots

mini so that one of the tactical cameras

is now looking at the thing which of

causes is going to cause Jerry I

apologize Jerry to scramble around

trying to figure out which cameras the

right one that's cool yeah so Kevin made

this dope stand which I'm just gonna

stamp everything with now and a really

cool mini thank you goes mini has

leopard print boots I believe it's boots

boots like leopard to match my own

ridiculous that's amazing yeah this is

it's fantastic a second extremely well

painted in that presentation meanwhile

Alan sent us to use as inspiration

markers these 3d printed coins which I

don't think you can see really about

they have my face on them and it's

horrifying it's pretty terrifying it's

well made don't get me wrong it's it's

major failing is the is the is the is

the person whose face it is up to the

light it looks like photographic yeah

like it's if you if you 3d print yeah

it's pretty great Wow

yeah if you if you shine a light through

it which it's obviously I don't know if

I can do here we know the camera close

enough but yeah it's pretty cool so when

somebody so for instance somebody

suggested that I should give Ana

inspiration for the dispel magic against

the dragon make sense to me there you go

in its you like now there's my face

there's my face enjoy what okay sure

yeah

Oh Jerry once he's bright

yeah so thank you Thank You Alan thank

you thank you for being inspired to make

these inspiration coins which we've

already used I just gave Judge

inspiration for also the fine young

gentleman who made judges sword whose

name I am going to reverse soon as I get

to the end of this Craig thank you

also known as computer capers and

Wintermute on the discord and outward

poly Corp on Twitter sent us an armory

sent us like like now this gentleman

makes does wood crafting basically a

blacksmith but with wood so see this but

yeah he sent boots a ryokan rapier which

is essentially I believe his

implementation of your drawing

yeah yes well you're on the TV they

definitely did there they definitely did

their homework yeah there's even though

there's even this is yeah this is pretty

much one for one witch and it's minute

of wood which is just duly impressive

yes that this is basically the sword

that I drew and posted on Twitter and

was like yeah do a sword for boots

people probably can't see this but

there's actually a spring-loaded

mechanical trigger that if you pull

it'll it'll shoot this little poison

dart and copper has

a goblin short-sword these all have

proper names by the way oh but they're

word that I don't know what they are I

don't know how to get written down here

it's in there because I want to hear

your pronunciation so copper is given a

6 which is se a act se ax well I mean a

simple combination of short sword large

knife and tool the CX is a candy

companion for a ranger with a baby

mm-hmm

it was uh played with a product edge

product edge insert and walnut handle

set in a plum would stand gnarly these

things came in the huge boxes it had to

be like unscrewed they were incredibly

well packed and then what did slim get

slim got a version of his Zambia so it's

got the the cool curly thing yeah and

yeah that's really badass yeah it's kind

of comes to the stand that all fit just

like the one that he carries yeah

awesome yeah and it comes with a cool

stand which I didn't want to take off my

shelf because there's a pain in the butt

you know there's actually I don't know

if you can see it but there's actually a

slot to put the you can you can have the

blade in the band it's really cool it's

really cool and I believe uh uh mr.

Driscoll oh yes something got something

ideally president because he looks and

leech got his own surging yeah so now I

can actually perform some work whoo nice

and sharp in real life

very much kind sir yeah thank you

then I believe King larsa's character

has what's that block is that like I can

put I can use that as a scabbard yeah

that's cool but I haven't looked at

yours oh it's cool study his leather

straps that good wow this is pretty

awesome he's got this like pounded

copper on the hilt it's really it's

super [ __ ] cool all this stuff is

unbelievable so yeah there's like I have

no idea if this gentleman does this like

commercially or as a hobby I think he

said in the letter which I don't know I

was just speculating wildly Jam King

maple to this I'm pretty certain for all

the blades that are that red color like

they're not if I remember they're not

which is like really cool so yeah so I

don't know if guy I don't think I don't

know if Craig makes these things

commercially or if he just did them

because this is a hobbyist thing sent

them to us but you can look him up on a

Twitter or he's also in our discord so

thank you very much like yeah we are

incredibly blown away by your generosity

and like a judge with like when we have

people come by the office friends of

ours and co-workers and stuff like that

one of the first things we show off is

Chuck is the flag that somebody made for

us

and the sword judges playing bears and

so now we've got more yeah yeah I got

this shirt this shirt is yes Laura

somebody sent who was the hoarder

that said I'm having a good time

questions yeah why is always so

miserable we said you have to wear that

shirt every time we play this is the

happiest I've ever seen it's 9 o'clock

it's already nine o'clock so I believe

now we are gonna look at some of the fan

which I don't know if I've seen any of

this once again you know some of the

stuff we do here is inspires people to

make art and that makes me happy artax

I love this piece I didn't see this I

this was almost like it is a cool take

on getting yeah this looks like it could

be like a Brahm peas or something odd

this is like dark Sun get the Yankee I

think was really cool yeah it's a like

it's a realistic yeah this is this is

great this is mud reporting - I just saw

this yeah this is great yeah whoever

loves a copper and big cat we had some

strong it's just so strong so strong

maybe you're sitting on big cats head

Chemical rounding - silly I can aim and

shoot at the same time oh yeah this is

great yeah oh this is yes the Sun

reflected in the lovers eyes yes that's

the name of that elf don't lost it yeah

yeah

m4a must restore yeah look at this good

day a corona Larry and Larry and a

corona don't correct it

[Laughter]

[Music]

is a reference to some kids

it's called spongebob okay no that's not

okay this is awesome this is great oh

this style was like really really cool

I'm a full-time artist I thought about

asking Jason to draw something happen to

get one of our artist friends to it

don't like a long time since we've done

it I mean small cuz I'm Way back here

but yeah it's just like the size of my

hand brings us a lot of joy some said we

need a counter for boots nonsense the

fact that boots got naked again she's

happened so often right you were turned

into a giant size Man Thing welcome back

folks I think we're gonna try and play

some dungeons or dragons now you folks

are still in the sapphire realm in the

power of the Moon which in somewhat

confusing manner is technically still in

in capital it's a it's a pocket universe

contained within the city and you now

have ostensibly you have a couple of

allies in the Knights of the Golden

Cross they're also called the Knights of

the gold raggin they have a couple of

other names and the the chief of them is

the vile silencer who was trying to

recruit you to essentially act as their

team infiltrating ring well and he

explains could you haven't asked but he

volunteers he says I'd very much like to

go myself but it should I do so should

any of us do so he gestures around the

room

the black iron pact would no hmm and

we'd rather if they if it's possible

that it's possible the seals have failed

on their own or there's some other

agency acting but the less the black

iron pact knows about what we are doing

the better and so from our point of view

an organization like yours familiar with

various manifolds in the Timescape

familiar in battle you stopped the Sun

elf even even mad a lesser organization

would have failed to do so many of my

own nights would not have been able to

do it so from our point of view your

perfect day's work well there's not a

moment to waste then if you need

anything you can ask Marcellus and he'll

help you Marcel says yeah I'll I'm happy

to be at your service I can stay at the

because I still have to attend class but

if you need me I can come by the dancing

minstrel or wherever weather is

convenient for you we don't really stay

at the fair Stream the fairest or the

Pharaohs dream yeah he's like it's kind

of far away from from college but yeah I

can come by and help out if you folks

need anything well I mean mostly I can

act as a conduit for information that's

probably our greatest power

it's our access to the pale white light

do you guys have a need to get our

things together a couple of days here

yeah we need to go on the trail we're

already close yeah something I'm just

gonna take it's not like we just go in

pick up things and come out right ring

well is a major structure yeah all right

yeah we have we again we have no we have

we have books that reference ring well

the pages are now I understand very

little Intel right yeah

I'm going in the ones with no way to get

more information but not it's you know I

say we're doing it let's go yeah I have

you I had breakfast I'm ready

now this sounds way cool yeah come on oh

we just forgetting that letter one well

sorry I just noticed that the screen

when it's like we're a solid gray I sort

of assumed that that is what you folks

can see that thing I'm going to do that

you can't see I know we're all fine down

here how are you

yeah all right so so so mm-hmm what uh

what are you worried about well we have

to you we should at least bother to give

the letter to what's-his-face because

stuff doesn't just stop working here

just because we go on a site adventure

right give it to Angel for The Diplomats

pouch just like I'm deluxe in the kid

yeah what I don't think yeah he's not

have we checked out we're gonna be we're

gonna use grumbles to monitor the

blacksmith that is working on their

weapons by the way I mentioned the

campaign diary how surprised that folks

were that it takes like 200 days to make

well that's assuming you're not trying

to make like a really cool weapon which

I think some of these folks are and we

probably 500 days oh great

yeah any people were like but I seem to

be this consensus among people that

that's crap I think that the idea is

that obviously if it was easy to do

there'd be lots of this stuff all over

the parts cuz there should be no rules

mutiny yeah what if we take them to a

dimension where time passes well that's

something I talked about is the idea

that someone could take the somnium to

never send to the astral see it

do something do something timewise

because time time in the astral see it's

different but I'm gonna do push-ups to

eat or drink oh there it is

it's so tough so Marcellus will be your

conduit between us and between our

organization in yours this may be this

may be the last time that you're here in

the sapphire realm that depends on how

things go

we'll be back there anything else as I

said before our the our power lies in

our knowledge more than any martial

strength is there anything else you

folks want to know what kind of a force

should we take with us into into this

ring well if we find an entrance

I probably help you have a wizard right

but apart from that you folks seem

pretty capable of handling yourselves we

don't know what's in it it's possible

it's possible the orc says this old orc

warrior says that that the ring will has

its own defenses back now that I say it

almost certainly does and those defenses

might not discriminate against allies

and enemies do you do you know if any of

the Lords capital are on Ajax's side or

attempting to contact or work with them

we don't but we assume that at least one

is when you say the Lords of capital -

and do you refer the leaders of the

guilds and you mean the you mean the hep

Lords of the great house yeah

oh I was coming I thought that's what

Matt call them hmm I thought that's what

Matt called them capital me met yes no I

think oh no the lures of catalysts are

easy it's easy mistake but the Lords of

capital are not right there like that

secret organization right that like

collects together and they all crap you

talked about this before well you're in

the presence of one of them

what is the Lord of capital that you

think works for Ajax we don't know we

don't know the master or the black iron

packets I mean I wonder if there's any

insight they can give us into when we

have to deal with these people because

we need to build we need to build up our

army yeah you know and all this stuff

right like who can help us and do that

who should we not trust well you folks

seem to be doing a pretty good job of

reconstituting your members on your own

that's kind of outside we're more but I

mean you didn't you didn't I read that

you're just reinforced yourself with a

unit of if you get any more information

about the black our impact let us know

because they they've attacked and killed

some of our men and we don't abide by

that vile silencer says I apologize for

being glib but I think it will you it

was giving us information mm-hmm all

right

certainly certainly if we get if we

learn anything about this we will tell

you yeah but they protect themselves

with words they have their own they have

their own sort so they have their own

source of power just as we do mm-hmm

what are we getting out of this well

yeah right well also like we I mean

there's a treasure trove of incredibly

powerful part of the piece that you guys

are gonna have access to yeah yeah some

of the things some of the things some of

the things found within ring well

presume another with a magic sword or

i'ma die trying it's a magic sword that

plays magic sword very important your

barn so be how that would be the best

cess it would be the best or the magic

sword that plays magic sword sword

guitar

some of the things you find within you

will have to we will insist that you

surrender but I think I can say on

behalf of pale white light that those

will almost always be our facts of great

evil mm-hmm all right well we can keep

the rest yeah maybe he says we're not

it's good we're it's we're more

concerned about stopping these items

from falling into the hands right we

can't of the of black iron and that's

that's that's in our immediate

short-term right like literally in the

next 12 to 36 hours we're afraid that

there's somewhere in the city that's

passed yeah so we good guys somewhere

somewhere in the city the black iron

pact is having the same meeting we're

having right now because the seals are

broken and in fact they may have had

that meeting two weeks ago they may be

the ones who broke the seal so we need

to know so this is a this is a race yeah

then maybe we should head off yeah we

didn't we didn't give a timeline for

delivering the thing to Brona and let

him talk to him anyway why would you say

we she said well you said it when you

see him give it away too soon right well

I wouldn't say for a few days there you

go that's we're not messengers yeah yeah

I'm just gonna have a boss sure thing

boss just every time was like hey look

at this is like no problem uh well what

did you send him next one huh I just let

him know about the black iron packed

oven and that they were the ones that

attacked us and that they oh do we need

to take they were courageous some of the

junior officers with us but I think we

should like he recommended or suggested

we take a wizard we probably should

well I yeah he only suggest that because

like that's kind of your one uh you guys

have a thief you sort of he would sort

of he would have angel but he would

think you but he wouldn't he would

assume boots was right always helped far

boots has always been a bard but I'm not

I'm not sure the

guys don't unlock lines guys don't these

guys can't look at you until the class

you're sorry when they look at boots

they're like yeah that guy could

probably Kalakh all right so you're

gonna need to be able to pick a lock and

you're going to be able to need to

decipher ancient arcane runes and do

that

Kenny are you an artist no yeah are you

are you proficient in our count right

yes yeah can we see your care to shape a

circle

you got a new thing didn't read it so

moaning it's too smooth Arkana you are

proficient in our canon yeah you're the

bonus of the sport yeah you're gonna

need with sure yeah yeah that's true no

no you asked this guy let's get a look

at you lot is like will sub out leech

and bring him bucks right yeah that's

fine yeah like is that what how I'm

gonna play bus oh well oh no oh baby

cool where is he bringing it yeah wait

now he's gone I'm he's got he's gone

we're incredibly not the done thing to

make fun of somebody's accent only I'm

only a real [ __ ] we do that I'm

surrounded by also doing well oh let's

have angels send bucks over on the tap

just yeah she's not here yeah

this is very read I pick Thank You Sun

ironically like if I can read it

actually I mean even without your class

listen they need they need that's what

they need they need D and D for old

people

large print large print birth yeah yeah

my angel not man

the angel oh wow I mean I guess like LP

Oh who was the place Paul ransom roll

the dancing so it's just so we're clear

like bile silence or saying if you have

any questions about anything how is it

time to ask about military what what we

are our job is associate our job is what

knowing stuff anyway their power their

power comes from you don't really know

what's inside though

no no one doesn't uh the Emperor managed

to remove the the history of it from the

universal and like what kind of things

we you were if you were us well we asked

the various noble houses and it's kind

of like yeah you guys are doing fine on

your own

you did mention it was some books on

ring will oh yeah there are there are

lots of them but now now when you're

gonna read it the the words are all

jumbled up or erased or they're just

another page duplicated like they used

the power of of that solar celestial

plus the Emperor had many powerful

halides and they conspired to cast some

spells some rituals probably better way

of putting it and that ritual removed

the memory of ring well from the world

so that only the name remain right and

so what's actually and it we're not on a

percent sure it's not that weird um it's

that there's magic stopping mmm-hmm all

right do you know what uh what artifacts

AJ Ajax might have nuns possessions no

to his friends to his friends now uh

apart from the Jade hand yeah he does

know and he can tell you yeah did you

get a set list yeah he tell he just

tells and now we know and now you know

okay cool

I don't have to figure out like the his

greatest weapon is the Christ

yeah well pyramid thing it's so it's not

pyramid that that's yeah yeah but yeah

that's his aunt Annies god we wrecked

that thing he's got a little like bubble

gum things inside of it that our ship

has uh-huh mind witness amide witness

yes that thing my honor

maybe but yeah he might have it's

possible to has the sky elf a line that

would surprise us but I think the pill

I think the pale white like that yeah

and she would have she probably would

have told us if that were true but maybe

not she doesn't tell us everything uh do

you know anything about mortems true

name no mortem did a Morton did an

excellent job of the last of the last

person last Oracle we used to try to

define that Morton was Warren's broken

mine she's still alive we take good care

of her but she shall probably never

speak of Corrin sentence again what do

you know about sorry no please as now

yeah fast now we are very we are very

careful of who we admit into the

sapphire realm and as I said before this

may be the last time you visited the

less the last time I saw capital when I

left capital that wasn't a whole sector

of it that was Undead

oh you speak of lady below yeah yes

what's the story there

lady Valletta holds the codex mortis her

family has for generations and she used

it to try to resurrect her dead husband

and it failed the resultant explosion of

necromantic energy converted everyone

alive in that district into some form of

revenant or Undead

well that's yes some great some great

powers preventing her husband from

returning to life and in her desperation

she turned to a dark power that she did

not understand hmm

and now she is a dead lady ruling over a

dead City who was her husband in life a

lord maximum Valletta one oh that one of

the Lords of the Great Houses

yeah the guy that that like like what

what what did he do that that some force

wouldn't keep him dead with such

with such a power we don't know we don't

know but but we think it may have

something to do with the black iron back

hmm these guys just we don't know who

paid the assassins to kill the prince

maybe had you are our knowledge lies

more in arcane matters rather than

rather than the strange strange motions

of the pieces on the chessboard down in

the city Thank You notionally from their

point of view of the city is below them

they think of this realm as being like

above the city and so it's like we don't

know if I were gonna say I'm not a

politician I could guess if I were gonna

guess my guess would probably the same

as yours who benefited the most from the

princes death simple question you answer

to that well how would you answer the

question I don't know you can learn a

lot in a week so on you're at don't

worry you're a you're a military

commander you're not you have other

virtues rather than being sophisticated

so kicked out of that the whole started

this with us taking our contract as

you're aware yeah

Ajax lady sorry oh yes it just has

allies all over he's been deeply wrong

with that contract we've every attempted

to do you know is can we doll Roth is he

a supporter of Ajax was he the one who

betrayed us Kenway of Lord can we have

Dora mmm no okay

hell with serials involvement if you're

familiar with it she's also an Oracle

ladies serial was the princess of the

orchid Court mm-hmm Ajax forced her

father to kneel to him mm-hmm

she swore revenge I think I don't think

it's much different than the situation

you have found yourself then do you know

if Ajax has actually defeated the

Pharaoh

yes in fact he has the Pharaoh in

custody it's kept him alive he doesn't

want a martyr why not murder him not

murder him okay um is the Empress at

risk the impress of Vergara yes agar

will fall I don't think there's any

doubt about that I don't think there is

really any force on earth that can stop

Ajax right now other than what might be

in ring well if the Lords of Capitol all

worked together they could probably stop

them but they're not and here I mean I

mean I don't mean the heads of the Great

Houses the super organisation they're

not really normal the Lord's are

capillar it's a secret organization

they're just in it's a euphemism it's a

term that's used to describe like the

most actual powerful people in the city

the Illuminati kinda yeah they're the

Illuminati but imagine if like I mean

the common people will refer to them

like that but anybody who thinks about

it for a while it's like well they don't

whoever these people are they don't get

along they don't work together but they

all know each other well who all a

woman's right there yeah I know any

others Matt will give you a list okay

things do we need to ask so to you it's

not necessarily a five-way it's not like

I'm waiting for you desolate

fragile question we don't want to walk

out of here and then be like oh well

that's why I went for like more tubes

names and stuff like that stuff that

Ajax has not something like that like

well obviously if we knew that

information Borden would be dead

oh he's live therefore yeah we can take

it on faith what what I could into

Golden Knights is that it's the Golden

Cross the Knights of the Golden Cross

and is they some of them down on the

mundane world in capital yeah sure

likely you're sitting across the table

from one of them right but that's he

goes to school and none of the rosin

there's not that we're not like an army

okay how does one become part of your

organization

you have to be sponsored by somebody

that was or any gestures to our salsa vo

who kind of like I was like well my

father was and so the rain came to me

from my grandfather three all right so

it's a hereditary thing it can be or

again as I say one could be sponsored

there's a test how large is the

resistance including you six I mean

you'd be about par for the course for a

lot yeah she doesn't tell me everything

so it's my job to kind of interpret her

her or ocular visions and try to

implement them but I don't think we're

alone can I always forget what tomorrow

is the yeah yeah can you get word out to

kumara that the chain is recruiting in

capital well we're not bows against Ajax

well you have people in tomorrow I'd

assume I don't know that I don't know

that there was a septa CAF it was a one

of the daughters of the Pharaoh it was a

member of organization but she's here

and she's here in captain Hoshi well she

probably won't ever go all right well I

got any other ideas for this assets

prisoner I don't know okay well don't

listen I mean do we need any stuff

resources

Janelle actually thought one thing what

do you know about the crown a house

pleaseth it's um

worth a few tens of thousands of crown

I would say encrusted with rubies and

sapphires it probably most of the new

houses have some kind of a writer Terry

so this is just normal chrome nothing

super special about it you know I'm sure

it's special Delaney Valletta all right

all right I don't know if you guys edit

any items you might give us that would

helpers in ring well we've got one guy

that's still having a hard time damaging

things that have to like make it magic

for a second that's a constitution oh

yeah concentration spell

uh yeah well Marcella Scipio Cisco can

use a short sword say buddy can use a

short sword all right there's a question

say yes or not can you got like three

words can you use can you use a short

sword certainly

Marcus Scipio says you'll need this and

he takes the sword off and says it's my

grandfather's sword don't appreciate you

giving it back to me but things in ring

the things in ring well will not laugh

at your at your rapier yeah I'm inclined

to laugh it myself because it's like a

Roman it's like a Roman short sword he

unclips it what's on table it's

literally just a plus one I can make use

of this this is cool

I'm honored by what cool stuff

interesting with the sword sir what did

you say what did you say you walked out

of this dream why I thought we were

gonna just pull this [ __ ] or the [ __ ]

the [ __ ] really seeps up at the Pharaohs

in I mean where are you right here by

this dancing minstrel like yeah if we're

you know there's no use in like wasting

time that's true going back and forth so

I sent a message to angel that's all

buts to get over here

as soon as possible

are there any to two-handed plus-one

weapons that judge might make you so

somebody else Skype a grandfather nice

shiny daggers yeah just be a magic sword

it doesn't have to whatever it's not

great and I just need something that's

two-handed is the specific part of it it

doesn't matter be a sort of via the moon

elfs eyes open and and you hear this you

hear that she opens her mouth and you

hear that and I don't know what the vile

silencer says and does this make sense

to bring the demons heart mmm tell

Bloods to bring the demon's heart what

what do anything with sin mo so what

else are you guys trying to Smith more

arrows mhm lean Aries in the mate sling

what mental or whatever it was called

yeah they don't have they don't have the

lore that they would they would have

gone to lay this area but if you bring

the sin metal and you bring the demon

art no all-tournament oh look we can do

that before we go into the yeah they can

do that today

[Laughter]

yeah yeah so Marcella Scipio says let me

show you around while we're waiting for

your friends how are you I'll get out

when they are at the well how long will

take on you I told her to use a carpet

ever I'm money oh no I

yeah this place is effectively like a

knot oh it's a combination of library

and magical research place and you see

people here doing all sorts of crazy

stuff like Bill right doing magical

circles and summoning members of the

courts from the from struggles and

followers and talking to there's all

sorts of crazy stuff happening in here

and you're given kind of the run of the

place and the vile silence our guide you

around well Marcellus goes back to the

ghostly Mistral and after by 20 minutes

Marcellus comes back and but says all

this crap this is gonna freak em yeah

and and yeah butts butts is like she's

drunk

I'm we're in another world

did you see the sky I thought it was

just blue but but it's I think it's I

think it's I think it's a giant I think

we might be sir I think we might be

inside a gemstone all the way down

oh that's um yeah that's that's a good

point like they do they will tell you on

the one they tell when they mention

other powerful beings in capital who

might be on their side they reference

ballasts and racks

she's an amethyst no she's a sapphire

ring but palace and Rexha sleeps

right no not like judge knows who she is

but yeah she'll read one story about a

dragon that's pages out of these are

posters yeah ballast on tracks is a

battle soundtrack sleeps Suns let's keep

let's keep it that way um okay so yeah

she's so yeah butts is like what is

going on where are we

what is this place I think we're inside

a gemstone man when she says that

Marcellus and the vile silencer look at

each other and smile like you've got the

right wizard we're going on an adventure

and you're gonna have a great time

or else what what am i what am I to do

with these I give them to Scipio is that

a is that a is that a moon elf yep

Wow and she like runs up to it should I

keep it together look I have so many

questions look with your eyes

how much does butts know what she thinks

can I and she wants she wants to talk to

him you know I read what look - oh yeah

yeah we all love to talk to them that's

a big wait and see I'm sure she wants to

go and [ __ ] but so but starts like

saying I'm Your Majesty uh no no that

happens and that's like my name is sorry

but she only talks to me yeah yeah judge

twice so yeah she doesn't really talk

just kind of squeaks screaming are there

any wine glasses in here

yes

I wish BOTS heard it because I'm a kid

just robots from now on just walk around

at the wineglass

yeah but butts wants to get caught up on

work you folks have done and I assume

you tell butts what's happening did you

ask about ladies area I guess she is she

really dead did you ask about what

happened to nails no did you ask

no no she just has a list of like all

the [ __ ] that's happen to you guys I

think about lady cereal but they

mentioned her and I assume she's dead

but sometime they talked about her in

the past tense

yeah but I mean if you want to ask that

question yeah now's the time what do you

what do you know about what happened to

lady cereal and the teeth of the Dragon

you know Megan nails well that's a

separate question and all of it they I

mean we believe ladies Harold's dead we

think that the destruction of Orion

annihilate her well it's possible that

she survived but we consider that very

unlikely and one of the Master Sword

imploded Reuter that's what the Jaden

does it's like made to destroy this it's

a I cut more of a general purpose tool

but yeah it's a it's an anti magic

it's an anti magic weapon made by the

first emperor of your car so we have a

theory what happened to our sorcerer was

that some of that energy escaped into

him and he began turning into a god on

the astral see yeah the pale white light

informed us of what happened yes

so what his uh his oh he was a sorcerer

correct not a wizard sorcerer no well

that's natural his natural latent

magical power would have just gone and

overlooked there wouldn't be anything

you folks could do he wouldn't have been

able to stop it it's you know if he had

been an elf that would have been a

different story but a human couldn't

contain that kind of power

if you

stopped and it would have it would have

destroyed him it would have ripped him

apart it would have gone mad

you saw a somewhat similar phenomenon on

the streets of King's Cross Oh how he's

like turning into a celestial kinda

means maybe I mean I think the

difference the orc the orc says the

difference would be the difference

between what your sorcerer was becoming

a celestial would be indistinguishable

the sword itself I think I think it's

safe to say that the teeth of the dragon

will no longer be part of what the

Master Sword destroyed I believe the

other swords lose their power Oh

interesting it's possible that somebody

might be able to forge a new master

sword but anyway yeah so they are they

are they're gonna be able to make your

weapon for you leech yeah and I and

they're gonna be able to make your demon

what happens is they get one of their

lower masters to come and lure masters

convene and they're going to take your

sword which they ask for and they take

the demon heart and they put them in the

pool yeah sort of madness comes out yes

and they're the moon elf opens her eyes

and holds her hand out like that like

like stop and the lore masters take a

step back and she speaks in her and then

they and they're humans they speak back

in that language and they have a little

conversation more elephants yeah well

and the orc watches and the orc

translates for you

and she says how excited is butts right

now that's pretty exciting

finite like much is like a hanging on to

the orc any like like completely for

having forgotten I don't actually know

this person alright like holy crap what

is happening it's like what is she

saying what is she saying and she's

saying that they are [ __ ] she just asked

if they know what they're doing and they

said this is a tool this is a tool that

our servants will need lady and she says

that this portal goes to this portal

goes to every realm and and can see

through every manifold do you know what

power you call forth and they say and

this is the orc translating back and

forth right and they say if you will it

then it will be and in other words in

the hip Doris's in other words they're

saying it's something like whether or

not you let this happen we just we just

are servants and need weapons and you

have given us power you need to give

them power and then she closes her eyes

and the pool that has judges sword in it

and has the demon heart in it goes from

this pale milky white to black and in

the center of it there was this glowing

red and out of the glowing red liquid in

the black pool Rises a demonic hand

holding a sword and its judges sword but

now on the pommel there's this like

glowing polished stone that has a cat's

eye like a cat's eye and it sort like

yeah I have Sora so this is an evil

weapon but now you have a demon friend

and the vile silencer shakes his head

and says we must be desperate I thought

for sure you'd give her like a goodly

aligned sword that when Tormentor

Oh beautiful that would have been

awesome be like having the mind play

around bunker judge yeah so yeah I don't

know what this or does I'm gonna have to

figure out I have some idea as soon as

you touch it you feel this connection

you like okay go ahead and make go ahead

make a Christmas a you don't even have

to Raleigh probably save it so to me and

you get the role its advantage it's just

a managed to do it now if I want to use

it I roll in the night only as far as

I'm concerned I'm gonna go ahead and use

[Laughter]

your old night yeah hold the name you

can roll higher it roll higher mm-hmm I

think I'm still long there you go yeah

to 119 so you feel the power

the the entity in this sword kind of

like as soon as you touch it it Springs

on your mind like it's trying to attack

you but you've been trained to deal with

this kind of attack before and it

bounces off of your mental shields and

there is definitely an entity in this

sword like there is the heart of the

demon mm-hmm that is in here and the

thing about it is like it's pally has a

personality and an attitude and all

sorts of all sorts of nice stuff but the

thing that definitely wants to do is it

wants to slay other demons yeah perfect

there's something about there's

something about the thing in this the

demon in this thing hates other demons

hey what do you think about 3rm Devils

yeah I think sunshine if I know if

Portillo like that so yeah

just one zero pick because it's tiny

fiend you're right it's a double shift

well fiends fiend covers double handymen

Oh devil win bracket type shifter devil

yeah

devil Debbie so judge is gonna like is

what pop I know I know I know we're the

worst of so she's gonna like like touch

the blade and say oh yes we're gonna get

a good way oh yeah oh yes so I don't

want to spring this on you because I

think judge would probably know this and

even if not I think probably by Oh

silence that would explain this yeah

it says when you are weak of the sword

will try to take over the the less

healthy or the closer you are to death

the harder it's gonna be for you to

resist the swords command and as long as

what you want to do what the sword line

do are the same then you're gonna be

fine

but there's a point where the sword

wants to do something and you don't but

you only have for it points you might

end up doing with the sword once so

that's something you got to watch out

for nice thing and it's kind of all

sorts of the crazy abilities I knew the

true scope of this weapon will not be

revealed to you for some time what did

you want mental weapon yes what kind of

weapons do oral arts use uh like do you

want a weapon like to use in battle like

to hit people with the stuff or like to

power up your [ __ ] what role you want

packed roja to pack Rock yeah packed rod

it so okay so I I may be I may be asking

the wrong question like so warlocks okay

yeah like if slim gets a plus-one weapon

mm-hmm that means every time he attacks

with it he gets to add one to his

attacker Oh link is dad wonder was - all

right but if you had a plus-one sword

what would you do with it you don't use

a sword right so your version of that is

what's called a packed rod like a rod

keeper and there might be some other

name for it it's basically a magical

focus and it can be a plus-one rod in

which case you were gonna when you use

your elders blast you had you had one to

the attack or one of the damage role and

stuff like that so that's that's but you

can it's in metal you can make it into

all sorts of stuff you can make into

weapons or armor you can make into a hat

it's it's a block outside it's up to you

no it's not auditors and Dragons I don't

feel so we play yeah so what is it

you're trying to get out of so I think

originally I did for the weapon was if

it could we talked about if the spell

was cast to meet remember yeah if you

make a life you make like armor I'd like

there's lots of different sin metal

recipes and I don't know which one these

folks are using I'm gonna figure that

out between now and the next time we

play no this is gonna happen and it if

you if you make armor out of it all

armor there's lots of different armor

recipes you can make out of sentimental

lots of different weapon recipes you can

use with sindelle all armor whatever

else it does it will protect you from

sunlight sensitivity and weapons will

store spells in them now we cast the

spell if somebody casts a spell at you

at you I'm like not at the area right so

me cast a spell at you there's a chance

that you could absorb it and it'll store

inside the inside your weapon and for

like the doís are that's awesome because

they use weapons right right so but for

a spell caster yes no but then i can

then use that spell back you could yeah

yeah sure absolutely yeah

okay yeah so you could make a rapier out

of it and but you don't use the rapier

no I know I'll go for the run I think or

repair is what you have equipped yeah so

you know they'll make a they'll make a

specialist in metal rod for you and I

will figure out what it does okay cuz

it'll do something apart from the basic

that's the base and then there's

different stuff on top cool yeah yeah I

mean these guys just did you [ __ ]

solid so oh yeah I did I'm like

give your little mug well don't hug me

hug the century he's the one that he's

the one that I'll put aside my saltiness

from earlier and I'll show you right

yeah the yeah the orc is I'm still kind

of trying to figure out what's gonna

happen

yeah the orc the orc just wants to

remind you folks that like we've just

invested a lot yeah in this team you're

our first team you're the alpha team and

we hope that we don't have to find a

beta team hope not either

we should succeed Felice so I think that

our goals are in accord mm-hm and anyone

who's an enemy of Ajax is an ally of

ours

so may you have the opportunity to

fulfill your contract

yeah good Marcellus says are we ready to

go

yep you too it's a ring off and and

as it spins in the air it lands on the

table in the dancing minstrel and you

guys are still sitting where you were

before

like I'm like no time has passed from

but butts

yeah and he's bones no he's with okay

all right well let's go get back to

right work understanding yeah yeah

exactly so you guys have okay so I think

I hate to do this I think we gotta stop

well no we can fight for a little bit we

can keep playing for a little because I

now got like a lot of work to do I got

to go get a I gotta get make a butts

retainer do you do it is a tab but is it

unique to bots or is it just yeah

there's just a generic enchanter and I

think butts is special so I would make a

I want to get a special retainer Carver

yeah we made these rules up we can do

stuff like make butts special we use

that for 15 minutes yet don't use it a

whole new Musa yeah

yeah that's true we had well he was a

bard if you just made it work and also

before we're gonna before we guys before

you guys get to a fight which i think is

gonna happen relatively soon I need to

know what your [ __ ] weapons do uh uh

ahem

bad point so I apologize for that but

that it wasn't a hundred percent uh I

didn't know that's cool so they're just

like illusions of it that was so awesome

I went from 500 days to now yeah well I

mean we were talking I think we did we

talked about this live online like

during this yeah yeah we talked about a

few guys went to the astral see you

might be able do something I'm a master

zan is different but definitely of the

moon that in the tower of the moon that

Moon elf can be like yeah like we we're

the reason there are magic items so yeah

I should have thought of that I'm not

smart you did right now yeah but I mean

I should have prepped that oh I should

have prepped oh they're definitely going

to be like hey can you

so how the city's back that it's you

know it's been a day since the incident

that happened here by the way this is

not what you guys are know guys are in

the rotated version because you guys

were the black dragon happen well yeah

so the question is well Marsellus by the

way it wants to he once you guys are

back in heroes i hugely stuck my neck

out for you guys by the way please do

not let me down we won we won't we never

do

are you gonna be staying here at the

dancing mr. unno will be backing barrows

dream after we all stay here just two

days as far away I'll stay what yeah

what ring row here it's also we're going

there right now though yeah are you

talking after we're done yeah talk about

oh I've heard it done problem what do

you mean after when you say after done

what you mean done when we complete okay

well he's not talking about like two

years from now he's talking about like

where are you gonna be like you talk

about the job right now ring well yeah

that's gonna take two years what in it

like well yeah I'm uh yeah Marcel's like

well kudos like one year who knows but

yeah like this is a sure this is where

we where are you guys gonna be over here

or the Pharaohs

yeah okay Chuck because if you're gonna

be here I'll stay here but if you're

gonna be the firm's dream eyes I cannot

come you can't cry he is like he is a

student at the work between contact them

well yeah we'll go to that one but if

you're gonna stay here then that's I'm

not trying to take other jobs right now

we've got a big one ahead of us yeah

yeah

so yeah he's gonna stay at the dancing

minstrel how are you guys gonna find the

interest frame well I think we should go

back to where the black dragons showed

up yeah to the ground sniff around

something like that okay a bunch of it's

blood there's probably like a magic

thing right like some reason wipe it off

the sword it's all over store did is get

the smell the blood and then yeah yeah

there's probably some residual Sun elf

blood it's not about like Slim's sword

so yeah so so it's a big cat four of its

legs - its legs are upright and form its

legs work its innocence and you put slim

sword in front and does nothing where it

goes it goes and then pulls air over its

Jacobsen we're gonna insets ankles and

then it does it again and takes it in

and it starts sniffing around and and

you see while it's doing this its

tentacles do like like it's it it's so a

big kind of so hyper-focused she is so

hyper focused on sniffing around you see

oh Holly's people in the town they're

trying to use this road back like when

they come around they see there's a

giant displacer beast and they may give

it a wide berth or they turn around and

go the other way and so you pretty

quickly you folks have the alleyway to

yourselves and yeah big cat is sniffing

around and and she after go ahead and

make a survival check yes either you

either you or big cat whichever would be

better cuz big guys'll be can is your

cat you are gonna help it out

it's uh I believe it's me how to be mean

and I'll survive over that King prays to

is hey Garen st. and is 1212

so there are the big cat goes up one

part of the alley and goes up the other

party alley and and big cat starts to

kind of get confused like like the trail

might be old doctor might not be oh oh

oh oh my have some it may be a stretch

but let me explain anyways primal

awareness or frequent yeah as an act I

can use a spell slot to focus my

awareness for one minute

and what within one mile I guess since

certain types of creatures are present

every Asian celestial dragon element of

a fiend undead I wonder what the Sun

mm-hmm that's cool celestial well no is

no it's not a celestial this is a

celestial Sun so maybe I can within one

mile I can sense the creatures presence

it's not technically alive but maybe

well it was it was not that long ago

yeah I off the spell I think that's a

pretty cool like if this were a skill

challenge

yeah are we a great use obviously we're

stretching the definition of it yeah but

that's kind of the fun of the game is

coming up with crazy [ __ ] yeah so we you

so copper casts a spell and you

definitely get this very faint sense of

some powerful and I guess the best way

copper would perceive it is clean like

some really polished clean disinfected

sense entity is down the alley

and now it's big cat how's it going

cover ok I have a lot of I need I need

the lessee see this is have too many

papers its elite sheet like roughly 1600

were it super broadly if people have

huge characters I can read it actually

will de joke but you watch big cat kind

of like and then coppers like Capri

casts a spell and then copper starts

walking off in one direction big cats

like and it adds off after copper and

the trail the sense of this like you

know how copper would perceive this

except like something that was really

well disinfected and clean and it leads

to an abandoned shop is a sign that

that's obviously it says closed and then

there are boards that have been nailed

up over it but it was a butcher shop

sign still here yeah check furred like

listen Anderson check for magic check

for traps I feel like I just a window I

can peek inside yeah just mundane put

your shop looking stuff everything's old

and dusty ok and there's not a lot it's

like imagine a butcher shop if you took

out everything that could be removed so

there's like a big marble counter for

cutting and dressing meat and their

hooks hanging on the inside but apart

from that no it's been is there a way to

get around the back no it's built into a

larger okay sock it's like a row house

on the deal alright the doors well I

mean it's dry you can assume that you

want but there's it's the it rattles it

does appear locked and there are two

large boards that have been nailed up

mock into the into the

into the door pull those off - we'll see

I mean that's happening we're going on a

full [ __ ] fitness training in the

Asheville Co I've been on to make the

weapons anymore but I need to get swole

so we're going can pull off the the

board so it's obviously no I have a 15th

strength yeah that's more than strong

enough to put your mind to it

rah you see King and people walk in my

er like keep moving shop yeah come back

in a month somebody like so many stops

yes that's a 13-4 persuasion but you're

wearing your fancy clothes do you well I

think it was persuasion that's what

you're supposed to do your fancy clothes

give you any kind of person any kind of

diplomatic inner okay so 15 in that case

yeah like this the the now their town

smoke standing around being like oh when

did you say you opened there's a

butcher's uh you know there hasn't been

a place close to my house you know it

for the past couple of years and I've

got to go down this I'm gonna do my

Rihanna I've got to go down down the

street and it takes me why my wife she

yells and she likes so when Dow what

kind of prices were you folks we're

exploring the possibility of purchasing

this establishment your friend said you

were butch was coming

he's optimistic clear off yeah well what

one should we one should I come back two

months well you know guilty as charged

mr. t we got a lot of work to do all

right though it'll be in the broadsheets

well teeth with it when the tiefling in

black armor and a demon psychic sword

says move on sorry luckily there are

powerful vermin in this shop that we

need to deep link right first yes

that's why light your hairs plan rats

huge the door is locked

can not rose lock do you need

lock-picking tools - it's sleight of

hand yes

so what's just like these tools and have

the skill inside them so there's no

skill called pick locks or thievery or

whatever it's called but if you have a

if you have a thieves if you have these

tools then you can do it I think is that

works what if I like used the blade of

my rapier to try and like the force on

the door you can take a look in the

window and see this misty step inside ok

you see is now inside there's like a

burst of mist me a water vapor and

slowly make a perception shake ok how

does your house or passive perception is

15 by the way matters but its advantage

on perception checks notice this guy's

invisible creatures 21 uh you hear a

seven you misty step in mm-hmm and start

walking around you hear this sound like

somewhere else in the butcher shop sound

like something falling down as you're

like a clattery you're not sure you're

not sure that's not a OH

so yeah slim opens the door someone

knocks something over be careful I heard

something

do I see anything where did the sound

come from further into the shop pointing

in the direction where you are right now

is basically like that

the commercial side of it not the

dressing me part and also there's a

there's a one obviously you can tell me

outside doesn't upstairs which

traditionally was where the butcher

would have lived probably butchering

that way would look like do you see any

tracks like recent tracks or anything

okay look for turn yes you may

there's not by the way there's not

really room in here for you

cattle it's like your cats as big as a

horse and this is a shop mmm

is it like a spell to miniaturize really

cute little a little bit little bit like

you could you could you don't lead big

cat through here yeah

maybe can't could squeeze in but like

there's not gonna be a lot of room for

big cat to if he gets in a fight or yeah

he's not gonna be open after that yeah

we're not going I'll be right back just

wait outside first

guard guard the door guard yeah I mean

creel turns three times and curls up

bright Sun outside takes his giant squid

tentacle thing and puts it over his eyes

and just sits on the stoop and starts

you guys all hear this guy like and then

in a long pause which as you know is the

is the sound of big cats leaving yeah

which everybody knows there's a sound

displace abuse makes when it's about

snores I was gonna look to see if the SC

Nia like recent tracks or any maybe

disturbances in the in the floor that

might have yeah you see these these

tracks that lead go ahead make a check

where it where I guess I yeah I don't

have a map in this place I'm an doing

map a bit behind

I'm not going yeah we're like I'm not

gonna draw it right inside the door I

soon yeah so go ahead and make a make a

survival check I think is that search is

what no is it that's why you're dragging

yeah but I think we're tracking it sure

see if I can see anything

18 so there's a door that there's a door

and there are tracks that you're in the

store the the door out is behind you

looking into the store there's a door

over here on the right and there's a

corridor that goes off into another part

that you can't see which has lots of

different rooms behind it so coppers

have to do a little bit exploring but

that door there are tracks that lead

right up to and they are fresh right

yeah okay are they oh yeah we can use

yourself yeah that's all there you know

I'd like a person like a like the you

know you all want a stealth in there

capturing question uh-huh okay so I mean

stealth okay we're gonna stealth into

that room okay the corridor what are the

tracks led to yeah who's we all of us

okay if they're all around me they all

get my cell phone cause nice mm-hmm how

close we have to be any word scooby-doo

mode right now it's like a 15 feet

around sorry I'll roll in there you guys

don't want to roll because you're gonna

like you're an armor and stuff like that

but if you follow copper and do a copper

says me yeah basically it's it's him

literally literally leading you like 24

yeah yeah no I can't nobody can hear you

if this guy follow me like this I'm

holding are these mouths shut so in in

the back there are various rooms used to

store and treat and dress meet and make

stuff like sausage and stuff like that

and there are like spice where there

were spices there are spice racks that

are empty and there is a there's like a

mess hall for the people that worked

here and there's a table and there's a

plate and there's a food on the plate

and there's a knife and a fork just

there on the table and I need judge to

make a perception check with advantage

[Music]

1313 awesome you don't know why why is

only judge make this role only Josiah

sounds like hell site person cuz it's

dark or okay as you can see [ __ ] that

other people search has a supernatural

supernatural hell vision yeah anybody

being Trixie them a little better now

another so that's what you see but you

definitely see tracks they lead into

this room and lead to the doorway I mean

but now there's but we can make the

conclusion that someone's here because

there's yes there's and there are no

tracks leaving the room

let's go stick our fingers in didn't

sound like it went in good I did I took

your finger into what food in the food

to see if it's warm or it is mm-hmm okay

it's it looks like meat but it's not

it's kind of like tofu actually uh leach

recognizes it

no he's drought foot its fungal it's

like fungal paddy and now [ __ ] yeah

basically its face yeah so I mean a

little bit it's good yeah

delicious either someone's living here

so that's a band and they found a house

or excited to like protecting the

entrance to them sorry

leaps yes how how big is your ferry fire

radius

let's sick of my where's that cough like

this yeah it's on the tight fit

I was just feeling like 60 feet 60 feet

low poke you guys it's for you your

heads right okay so why don't you put it

on OD and this is like why around a

human human shot if anything it's

outlined because that's how it works

right yeah it would get what creatures

cannot benefit from invisibility yeah

let's do it

good idea there I changed sign that

we're all being quite you know I'll

change I mean you know very fun oh I'm

gonna take cars doing nothing oh you

don't know train sign oh you know no no

it means don't you stay away

really yeah some doesn't speak you're

crazy sign line I'm gonna cast very far

on how big this room it's this room is

like um ten feet wide and about 20 feet

long with a long it's a long three in

the room room yeah it's a long narrow

room okay it's gonna cast it in the room

and okay if anything would claim what so

what does that spell do I'm sorry read

it to me well the main thing is what's

that tax against affected creatures have

advantage and affected creatures cannot

benefit from invisibility and I don't

somebody how do you do never the

creature has affected or not it's a deck

save in a 20-foot cube well if they're I

mean a deck save that I mean assumes

there's something in it say yes it does

what's the what's the DC what's your

spell save DC 15 maybe it's helping your

spell-casting thing I wanna give you pay

tone in one-page DC full tape 15 if

there's new item gives a bonus well

that's an exact comport for the weapon

oh yeah if it's a rod of the pack keeper

whatever hmm bonus what I mean if this

is a drow I guess that's better

so it might be just like under underdog

stuff right because like that like war

gar look down with drought don't they

know I think their enemies

oh when we go do our physical training

and the ASP will see multi-chain science

will switch off classes you do physical

training and then okay yeah that's the

plan

I'm trying that's what we're doing

you walk out you'll say hello

Wow least you finished casting your

spell and outlined in the fairy fire is

a drow assassin and hiding in the corner

of the room and I'll see you folks next

week we're not gonna kill this guy we're

gonna catch them yes yeah yeah okay cuz

again I don't know if he's home if he's

just hanging out here cuz it's abandoned

or if he's protecting why is that a son

yeah say that yeah that was a dumb thing

for me to think I go talk to do is

running we wanted to but you said you

made it like it was very urgent that we

did this I didn't know you guys we're

gonna spend the night in the district I

thought you guys were gonna this is

inside baseball [ __ ] I thought you guys

were literally just gonna be like okay

well I'm sure nothing else is gonna

happen to us why we need to rest

let's go talk to Duke Verona and then

who knows what crazy [ __ ] would happen

in that bridge adventure but I'm like

[ __ ] I think if they stay in the city I

think that the Knights of the Golden

Cross if they stay in this district I

think the Knights our Golden Cross are

gonna come get him huh and say we need

we need you guys that was still gonna

happen it was just gonna like we fought

an adult black dragon and a [ __ ]

celestial and then like we're like oh my

God we're so rekt we need to rest and

then the next morning they're like you

guys fought it's old black dragon it's

like oh yeah no problem

you got you got to play up your legend

man yeah yeah big so yeah the name of

times episode was a sapphire sky because

that was probably the last thing that

happened was when that dude said welcome

to the resistance the war against Ajax

begins here so we'll see

so yeah I think starting next week

I don't know how interesting is gonna be

to watch we'll find out I think it's

gonna eat fun to play is there some like

legit dungeon crawlers guys folks who

watch the campaign diary for like a lot

of comments in the YouTube channel is it

just gonna be them grinding room through

room for room for you know 20 levels or

whatever but I bought all the mega

dungeons I've ever run I'll have lots of

politics and factions and the fact that

the fact that ring well is in capital

suddenly now like everyone you guys have

met so far like all the factions you've

met so far all gonna be super interested

and what is that what can we get out of

it how can we use that so it's not like

submerging levels it's gonna be this

crazy I've run this dungeon for it's

gonna be a it's there's gonna be a lot

of crazy it's just it goes not

break no I'm just not you just I just

not used to doing things we just run
