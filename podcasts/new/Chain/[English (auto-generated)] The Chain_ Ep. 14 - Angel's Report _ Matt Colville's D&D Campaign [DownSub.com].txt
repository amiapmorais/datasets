long as you're so cynical and untrusting

who hurt you Lars Oh me actually that

was me

[Music]

[Music]

mm hello hi welcome aboard everybody

hmmm thank you for tuning in

we don't do announcements at this point

I don't even know if we have any

announcements we don't have any sponsors

other than you you folks supporting us

on Twitch and on patreon if you go by

our store and buy our book that helps

keep the lights on in the doors open and

we appreciate all that stuff because we

work hard to do this stuff ultimately

what where did we leave our heroes I was

still with the undead dude that's right

boots was over blocked by a giant and

judge ran off to go find boots teresi

Artyom yes yeah correct

boots had been boots had decided to

spend the night in the footstool and was

attacked by shadows the hypnotized and

then yes two shoes and I fought them off

naked I was in the news we lost three

maybe four yeah yeah and all of the all

of the know the rest of the tennis so

yeah Bastogne giant who runs this place

or owns the place or whatever is

understandably a bit upset didn't want

to let me leave you just lost 10% of our

troops yeah over technically well it

depends on Segal if you don't count you

guys yeah yes and so when so you folks

just read a broad sheet that describes

the incident because it's like you know

it's breakfast time and you guys are at

the hanging garden in the Pharaoh's

dream and judge sees this article

describing the incident at the inn last

night as like we've we've gotta go so

you guys Lee assume you leave the

Pharaoh's dream and you head over to the

the the footstool okay slit uh we all go

I have

stole at the end there guy yes too eager

to stay with the undead guy finished

your [ __ ] pants actually so yeah he's

giving you the check he's and you've uh

he's given you the check you've given

him the crown and he has given you his

card with an address on it and he says

in two days if you're here he'll get a

meeting with the curator uh leaked she's

hovering around behind King as well

waiting for him to finish okay if you

have any other work for us

not not not at the moment but you you

finish this with great alacrity

all right well keep us in mind I will

all right handshake now we'll leave with

leach okay his hand falls off yeah like

he's not a hunt for some the whole

handshake thing but uh but he'll he'll

do it he'll like bill like King sir

before we leave may I have a quick word

sure the sunlights outside in capital is

very very strong and even though OD does

have a parasol to protect me I wonder if

my services would be better back at the

dark dream master slim did give me a

report that she is in very good health

but I do worry about some of the

terrible things that may have nibbled on

her when she was on the endless sea sir

you realize we have a crew take care of

that sir sir you'd like me to accompany

you to see if master boots is fine yep

sir od prepare the parasol

parasol in starts starts flying off

right should get like a like a burka or

something well we had that other drow we

think of the drow come by

oh I'm like some Pope in the carriage

yeah you guys saw you guys saw some drow

I look like a drought Nobel were very

rich drought weird row if you wanted to

get a litter yeah so you guys make your

way with with paste I assume to the

Pharaohs dream and Odie enjoys getting

distracted and kind of like with I'm

flying off in a direction and exposing

you to sunlight and then why's he flies

back yeah and so you're you're pretty

constantly being exposed drow have

sunlight sensitivity which means he's a

disadvantage to all his attacks and

stuff you show up at the so now it's

like if if it was like mmm 6 a.m. is

dawn and it's prob about 8 o'clock by

the time you guys get to the footstool

and there's a crowd of people and

outside the footstool you see some

members of the chain including boots and

there is a stone giant here the the

first floor of the footstool is like 20

feet high and there's a dwarf out here

and there is a like I said there's a

crowd of people gathered and there's a

gold button that you recognize if you've

met before a lady

yeah yeah captain judges favorite

mention Zia who's Anne who's everyone

lady is a cop yeah you know we could we

could get you like a book or something

to rice it's fine like Lawrence has a

problem is I like the contrast between

this and the super super and

and then hang on I've gotta here

somewhere it's too true sir

I accept my - shoes give us a report

I'll take it just to get a room so

captain Cinzia like some day there's a

bunch of gold buttons around here

captain Chen zero is just the

highest-ranking one and they hold you I

think she wanted hold me back yeah yeah

yeah now the the the gold button talking

to you says you know when when the

captain is done you can talk to your you

can talk to your friend and they're

questioning you like the first person

has shown up before the cops got here

was near oh great

yeah and it's just after dawn and he has

a bunch of well use words moving

slightly back and forward in time so

again and the first person to get here

is Nero and he's he's delighted to see

the chain of Akron and he's like my

friends and he's got his his notebook

out and he's like he's like you don't

know what the real in version of Black

gods is but he says black gods when he

sees there's dead bodies all fit around

to the end there's a pissed-off stone

giant and he could the room he basically

says what happened here I'm just gonna

look at the stone giant I really want to

be the first to answer

well the stone giant starts talking

about how there was an assault there was

an attack that these these soldiers were

here they did nothing they they didn't

they didn't stop it they might have been

complicit in it they were drinking all

night they're they're they have they

have you know creatures in their in

their midst from other planes and this

guy is angry about what has happened and

wants to blame anybody that is in

earshot and so neuro is taking it all

down he goes I think I recognize that

uniform if we met uh but I don't think

we shook hands or anything of that chain

is a macron yes allegedly and are you in

charge of these are these uh I notice

there's like another

fifteen or twenty oh you folks here is

this where you people are staying some

of us yes interesting and were you

attacked yes Tezz grunt bronto's the

name of the stone giant Ron says though

there were just uh or that was a dozens

how many how many how many shadows were

there this was an ambush all I know is

that I woke up in the middle of the

night with three shadowy figures living

in my room Jay defended yourself course

of course I had to rush to action yeah

my man and I fought valiantly

what were you folks doing here what does

anyone do it at an inn oh well fair

enough

and after he questions he questions some

of the other members of the chaîne and

you know two-shoes does not does not

give anything up to shoes is very you

know you're gonna have to talk to you're

gonna have to she points to boots and

she's like you're gonna have to talk but

some of the other members of the chain

are like oh yeah we were celebrating and

I was passed out and and so near I was

writing all this stuff down and then

officer Cinzia shows up and she kind of

kicks niro out and the other some of the

people in the chain of Akron some of the

regular soldiers are like hey can we go

and the cop is like well yell you'll be

able to go in a little while I just have

some questions and she asks a lot of the

same questions that Nero asked but she

is a lot more serious about right

I would I would give her a little more

detail being ass like our interactions

with Herman you can see through the

window of the of the footstool that

there was a crowd of people hmm

assembling outside and there are other

cops outside and then after she after

she interrogate cyou and asks what

happened like she says what did you see

anybody was there anybody suspicious in

the end last night was it just you and

your soldiers there were other just

other guests at the end but anyway act

suspicious

any of them react strongly when you guys

showed up no none of it stands out to my

memory it's like how many people would

you say were Indian besides you and your

men I don't know what another dozen

maybe another dozen and she looks at the

at the stone giant she's like then any

of them make it and this don't sound

like no they're all dead all my guests

dead

we were also his guests to be fair he's

the the stones on our guys were dead

yeah yeah yeah yeah but like most of

your guys survived um and she just asked

scissors is there any uh she's like who

broke the window did that happen last

night at the during your revels she's

just asking the group and people you

don't have to say anything other

soldiers will be like no man somebody

broke that thing last night and and they

point to the iron bar on the floor i I

went to sleep with zero specters in my

bedroom and when I woke up there were

three of them Dodd good night

where was Gronk or whatever the hell his

name isn't hmm where was I wrong during

all this good question

so like how like about how many spectres

do you think you and your men saw I'm

gonna sort of like whisper to her so my

hypothesis is you want to talk yeah

let's go outside

all right so she leaves you and your men

she was your men inside and then outside

there was a crowd of people there like

looking in and they they're just gawking

they just want to see what's going on

and there's like a bunch of blue a bunch

of gold buttons making a perimeter mmm

she's like okay what what do you think

happen uh when these things showed up by

incapacitator few of them in my room

yeah and I I ran to get the rest of the

men uh and I found them in the hallway

in similar situations they've been

woken up in the middle of the night they

were fighting these things off I saw two

of them killed one of our men mm-hmm and

from his dead body

another Spectre right arose same as the

others same as the other so you know a

priest are you know well I mean you

would a definition is the same so the

thing that came out of here out of your

dead friend is the same as the things

that attack you yes so would it be

reasonable to assume that there was one

Spectre one shade one shadow whatever

they were for everybody that died yep so

I gotta ask this like who was the last

person we folks really upset like where

were you yesterday we weren't even here

well it's kind of a broad answer like we

were what was the last contract you're

completed we were running an errand yeah

yeah yeah I bet you do that a lot for

who for uh hang on I need to decide if

for some friends this was this was a

glorified grocery run

all right you can go back inside I mean

you know how long we've been here yeah

yeah I know how long you've been here

and already been attacked by a bunch of

undead whatever they were and people are

dead some of your people yeah I get that

but it seems like a whole bunch innocent

people died I just sort of like to know

what you been up to well who who would

who would who's even capable of doing

something like this in this city a lot

of people

like look I'm not gonna take you to the

I'm not gonna take you to the I was

gonna say downtown but this is not no

she's like town I'm not gonna lock you

up already I'm not gonna cure up or

anything it's just that you know I'm

kind of you know call me naive but I

figure that if this is something

personal against you and your team it's

probably in retaliation for whatever you

just did so you tell me you know you ask

a question like who could do this I

don't know but probably the enemies or

whoever you're working for can do it and

so if I knew who those people were maybe

I could make some progress on this I

might be able to find out all right well

it's not like I don't know where you

guys stay you guys leo she points to the

hang on a second I don't know where you

stay how can I get in touch with you she

names the hall that the police operate

out of that the gold buttons operate out

of okay like anybody else and there's

and you you you can't really move on the

Piazza very far without seeing a gold

button there's they're all over the

place

so guys ask anybody but if we want to

get in touch with you specifically she

points to she has a number on her badge

all right it's like one 301 cool she's

like officer Cinzia one 301 and at that

point the stone giant kind of bursts out

of his in and walks up to officer Cinzia

and is like what are you doing about

this are you going to arrest anyone this

is the end of my business my reputation

is gonna be destroyed no one will stay

here and she's like you know she's huge

she's a UH you know a short woman and he

was a massive stone giant and he's

trying to intimidate her and she's like

I don't know I think your reputation is

probably to be improved like people are

gonna want to come here and see the

place and you know see where all this

stuff happened and you might make a make

some money off of this sir giant I'm

sorry I didn't catch your name

I am grunt grunt

you uh you own this establishment it's

mine okay

how much you want for it how would you

react I don't know about you but I'm

kind of a thirsting for a bit of

retaliation some of my men died as well

we just got lucky but we're trained

professional soldiers and we could fight

them off I also notice you also weren't

killed by these shades we didn't have to

fight a gigantic shade member anything

for that maybe you could be uh you know

maybe we could help each other out you

make a persuasion Shack it's been it's

been a while since the last time Oh

[Music]

sixteen sixteen is not bad so he's taken

aback by this and does not know how to

respond the cop is super interested in

this in this back and forth and is

watching it and this dwarf comes up

behind him and the dwarfs the dwarfs

like God don't do anything stupid cut

and go it's like huh the dwarf is like

obviously we need better guards he

points it at you Rancic uh-huh ah I just

want to make this right grant we didn't

intend for this to happen the cop is

like alright well I'm gonna leave you to

your negotiations at that point these

folks show up all right we don't cross

paths with Nero Nero is already gone he

went to write the story that you read

and then came over here yeah there's Sun

there's only there's some beef we've

we've done some time has passed between

on panel and another panel but between

the very early morning when Nero got

there and got the scoop and you guys

getting there hours have passed and

that's about how long it takes him to

get get a story into the morning paper

all right well I'm gonna give them the

scoop on like what all happened what I

you know I sort of gave officer Sheehan

see the short version and didn't tell

her who he worked for only because like

if we want to like we can get in touch

with her and be like hey listen what do

you know about house Valletta that kind

of thing was always a part of the deal

so look she she she lets you folks past

the perimeter so that you can talk to us

so you can talk to boots and I'm of the

opinion that you know partly because I

feel like we kind of we kind of owe this

guy a favor just because like you know a

lot of people got killed here this is

Brian and great things for his business

like you know we could we could help him

out also he's a stone giant so you know

we could get him I think that's kind of

a good look captain can talk to you with

hermit for a minute sure she just sure

still you to the to the end and she goes

inside who was that that officer chazzy

okay I was hoping that just my demeanor

and the way I did it but it can I go

what can I say to that because she seems

just as if it's odd she seems just

incredibly [ __ ] put out by all this

like oh my god I can't believe the crap

I have to deal with so you're going

inside and there's still a whole bunch

of members of the chaîne in here

and there was just a ton of dead bodies

all over the place including two two

members to two office not officers two

soldiers you know dead she's like so how

long you been in the city the three days

four days technically only two days cuz

we've been done you've been gone yeah

where were you running a job right yeah

what was the job who are you working for

we signed a NBA

[Laughter]

where'd you go that wasn't that uh that

wasn't in the contract uh to the world

boy right okay yeah so like I'm just

gonna be a asked a really broad question

feel free to answer in whatever manner

you see fit

who did you piss off like let's start at

the most recent person you've pissed off

Florida we have worked backwards the

Lord uh while most recent person we've

pissed off it wasn't one of the other

people who came and asked us to do jobs

which I think we can't disclose she's

super interested in that so you turned

out he made a couple people angry turned

on a couple jobs huh uh we didn't turn

him down but she didn't do him yet so

somebody came to you and said hey can

you help us out and you said well we'll

think about it yeah and then a whole

bunch of people died it looks like two

of our people died right a whole bunch

of people died yeah neither of those

neither of those guys looked very uh

threatening

no well I'll be the judge of that so who

was it who was it offering your job just

consult my diary you can just tell me

that you tell her okay my fella it was

the bishop whatever habit not free yeah

Abbott ah three of the Church of the

thirteen so yeah she doesn't she blows

off she blows off the the Herald like

when you're like oh this one guy she's

like no and but when you're like I'll

have an offering she's like a banoffee

came and talked to you about the Citadel

right yeah he offered you the Citadel

job and you said no or you said whatever

mm-hmm right yeah okay hmm

yeah all right you think you would have

retaliated against us I don't know I

don't know this has anything to do with

you or anything it could could be a

complete like it's a crazy City

I don't know anything yet so I'm just

gonna ask a lot of people a lot of

questions until I think

something out probably we won't know

anything until the next time something

like this happens and then you hear a

voice say you won't have to wait long

and there's a night you folks have seen

this guy walk through the the brass

buttons just let him by and he looks

sort of like like Tom Hiddleston if Tom

millstone was wearing this like dope-ass

armor and he's got a pair of black

leather like riding gloves pinned to one

of his pauldrons and he just walks

through and walks in and officer Cinzia

is like commander Donegal what a

pleasure to see you and they start

having a conversation about what's

happened here just right now so I think

you guys are free you guys have you guys

have the officer Cinzia when she saw the

rest of the chain of Akron showed up

show up she lets you guys in through the

accordant it's just like twelve twelve

cops and a whole bunch of people and

there's at this point there's foot

traffic going by and people are stopping

to look inside and there's you know can

we hear that conversation depend you

know you can go inside the doors open

pretty good stand outside the door and

listen but this guy appears to be like

of another in fact officer Cinzia says

commander Donegal we were just talking

about you was the Church of st. Pilar yo

the aspirant want with this place and

he's like oh I was just passing by and I

saw that there was some kind of some

kind of disturbance and I thought I

might lend a hand

geez AHA and he starts asking questions

of the people in the thing about the

nature of the undead like how many how

many were there were the shades were

they shadows but the shadows or were

they specters and like to shoes is like

I'm pretty sure they were shadows he's

like and who are you and there's a whole

conversation between him and two-shoes

and when he realizes that - she's as a

paladin and probably has some like

church related knowledge he starts

taking more starts taking her more

seriously and he's more interested in

the nature

the undead that came in here and he

often Sachin's he asks him if he knows

anything about what happened here and he

says no but I know this is the third

time it's happened and she's like oh

really

he's like don't you read the broadsheets

she's like not as I have it no and he

describes two other instances in the

past couple of weeks where a place has

been wiped out by shadows who was who

were who were those people I mean what

were the other place there's a library

was hit and a church in two different

two different districts of the city not

not not not any other jobs mm-hmm

library job and a different library oh

okay a lot am I gonna go there Roman

library it's and this was this is well

before you guys guy okay this is weeks

what else was like is there any other

like what who whose library whose Church

I'm sorry who do I have the honor of

addressing says this Tommy we'll still

looking night guy they call me boots can

I just assume they addressed real weird

yeah I mean it would only be more

perfect if I was still just wearing the

boots they call me be like let me guess

boots no but yeah officer Donegal says

put your points at your boots he says

well I can see why he looks at uniform

he says you're with the chain of Acheron

yes sir I am

who are you with if I'm if I might he's

with the Church of st. polari oh the

aspirant OSE oh yeah gosh he points to

the black he goes he points to the black

gloves and so I'm with the Church of

sample arias we're supposed to know oh

god did that bitten off read have no no

she's not a knight great he's just a

like I have an offer it's like a clerk

basically do you know who occupied this

this library in this journal it's um

some meaningless public building okay

hey it's all in the papers you can read

it yourself so would you imagine that

like that would you imagine that this

was because the chain were staying here

or do you see this is this like a string

of random attacks he kind of nudges one

of the dead bodies with his foot like

it's looking at and he's like I think

it's too early to tell it could be a

coincidence could be they're after

something else I mean why does why does

any cult do anything occult you say well

it could be anything but I've lived in

the city my whole life probably a cult a

lot of cults sure dozens of them cool

mm-hmm so he an officer Cinzia Cotton

Exchange unpleasantries and I sees like

he says as he's getting ready to leave

he says to office least ops and looks

down officer Cinzia and his like and

what do you don't know what are the gold

buttons think about this and officer

Cinzia is like well I think that if

things were different I'd say we should

work together on this I think it's just

walks out the door he says yes but you

won't say that because you know I would

ignore you that guy did this [ __ ] yeah

[Laughter]

officer djinns he is like he's check

what the hell was that all about

he's checking up on his zoos that guy

mmm mr. looky loo just politics

she says territory I don't know how it

is with mercenaries I don't know

is this his territory you'd like it to

be uh how he'll mercenaries work is that

if you kill our men you're gonna have a

problem with us well I don't think there

was any danger that he was involved in

what happened here but I don't think it

bothers him that I happened

do I see where he goes I could get Odie

to follow him yeah oh no this guy goes

ot invisible please follow the follow

the night with the black gloves OD all

the night was black clouds Pollock I was

playing now leave the Brawley leave the

Paracels you're outside yeah all right

if you hear you hear the invisible

grumbling of your imp come here do that

flies way officer Cinzia what what is

his territory

just out of curiosity she's like I don't

I don't keep up with the broadsheets I

got she points to the sick I got a lot

of work to do but you think that I think

that he's happy that he's happy that

that the church now controls the Citadel

that doesn't bother him okay I don't

know how things work in the city but do

you think that when these things happen

and people get all upset right and then

he shows up I'm like hey we'll protect

you you know my experience like whenever

something crazy happens the first one to

show up and say something dumb is the

changeling what big cat did grant know

yeah he's showing up to check his work

to see what the damage did yeah yeah

what damage he's the officer Cinzia is

like leave the investigating to me

speaking of investigating have you

figured out where the robot children

came from there's that pulling off your

radar a balance bring yes I assume

they've Gandhi

is supposed to be a pun it is pretty

good actually

she's like pun let's say well what's a

pun exact joke joke well that's

debatable she's like well she's trying

to think of if there was anything else

she has to ask you folks she was like

well she's like you've got stuff to work

out with the innkeeper I don't think he

has any he wants me to arrest somebody

but I don't think any of you had

anything to do with this I just got to

figure out whether or not you folks were

the target or whether you're just well

we're just in the wrong place at the

wrong time

hang on one perhaps we're in the right

place at the right time yeah otherwise

they'd all everyone would be dead yeah

otherwise you know garance might be is

this haunting this place with a 20-foot

shadow it's happened to other places

without us even being there yeah

absolutely wipe out everybody at the two

previous places yeah the office urgency

doesn't actually go she's like that's

and that she's like so depending on like

it's easy to think of where you guys are

as capital and it is but technically you

guys are on an island yeah and officer

Chen Xia is one of those people that

calls the city like from your point of

view this is a city this is like this is

more than black bottom and this is just

this one island and but she thinks of

that as stuff it up in the city who

knows what goes on over there it's

outside my territory are the broadsheets

and those who follow Florida aspirant

friendly I mean I don't know

define friendly where one is the other

one is not far behind no I don't think

there's anyone I don't think there's

anybody in capital that that that's that

friendly but I don't right now I'm not

inclined to see gront's point of view

he's just angry and wants to yell at

somebody I don't think you folks had

anything to do with this I think I know

I can tell you're just victims the

question is were you're the targets

and I don't know so I'll have my men

clean all this up she says to grant

before you go can I have a word with my

commander listen I've got a job and it's

not babysitting you folks so you need to

talk to me you can find me down at the

hall did she give us the locations of

the other the library in this no no but

it's in a broadsheet but but commander

commander Donna Gould said check the

broadsheets

she's like she didn't know this had

happened she just found out the same way

you guys found out because that her

attitude is like that's the city who

knows what happened to see don't listen

to everything that guy says mm-hmm if

you find out where the targets will you

let us know if I think you need to know

yeah what do you think we would need to

know if we are the targets known

ourselves I'm more interested in finding

out who did this and arresting them I'm

very much protected sir visit what

protecting what nothing never mind

different plane systems well you know

where you can find me and I know I can

find you you folks gonna be staying here

Grant is like yes he wants us oh and do

you like the door feels like I think

we've got some new guards if we must

stay here well grant is hoping that he

can work out a deal where like this is a

place that's you know the reason that

more people didn't die was because the

chain of a kurayan bended them off and

this place is safe because the chain

stays here you can advertise that you

can spray not use mean advertise like

they can hand out but spread the word

right yeah and that way people that way

people would be like instead of don't

don't stay there you will die a shadow

will come show up and kill you all right

they're like Oh awesome is these guys

have these dope ass carts it'll be it'll

be totally safe yeah the new marketing

thing haunted reduce that's kind of what

officer Chen Xia was saying she was like

hey man plays to the to the shadow

whatever the chain that's already taken

yeah so um uh he's our date back is

already back yeah no okay you told

though would you to go follow that guy

and that guy isn't dead series at mmm so

what does it look like when you do that

what do other people see like what

happens to what happens to leech like

they my eyes roll mmm so you should I

just go up okay you Paul brand yeah I

talk but my eyes guy okay right so that

you see my guy from red to grey you see

leeches eyes kind of roll up and now

they're on solid gray and yeah you just

you're watching kind of like a drone

view of this night and where this guy

goes people get out of his way mm-hm

like the streets of the Piazza here in

the stays are usually super crowded and

we need to get a prop prop dude okay

slim is putting things like although I

can't see being placed on but it makes

me a little uncomfortable he's he's

headed to a church he goes to it's a

small it's a relatively small Church and

it looks like it's in a part of the

stays where there are lots of churches

some of them are bigger than this one

and and there was a forbidden like OD

does not does not does not feel there's

like a force preventing OD the the IMP

I'm entering this holy place but looks

like he just went to a church mm-hmm

and looking around from bodis eyes

panning around with your VR goggles on

you can see that like I said there are

spires and there are lots of churches

right here including churches that are

obviously from other parts of Orton as a

cigar in church there's a compact chemic

Church it's nothing

I would bleach would recognize I've

never been in no no no no so I don't

III don't know are you do you consider

yourself like an expert on local

religions man you like that see what you

see in a while okay so I can probably

describe it as best I can but not much

more than that yeah so leech leech comes

to and get ID to fly back sarkodie comes

back after Lola and and and there's a

point at which at my office urchins he

leaves most of the gold buttons leave

but a couple stay and after about twenty

minutes a bunch of Knowles show up no

yeah and they're wearing at first it

looks like some kind of like pilgrims

like on you know they're they're just

wearing rags and they're they're their

arms and legs are bandaged up and

they're they're they're hooded and when

they get to there's six of them when

they get to the end they take their

hoods off and they don't make eye

contact with you folks and they start

grabbing the bodies and they've got a

cart and they start piling the bodies

into the cart and they start washing the

place down and they start cleaning well

cool Newspeak comment how they are you

talking too much themselves they in

Knoll and but they they mostly mutter

right and they don't they don't make eye

contact

they're tall there are these they're

large Hyneman and they smell they are

they they're they smell of like awful

and and they smell like the sewer no I

remember him wanted to talk to me this

guy definitely did that sorry do you

think we should do you think we should

tell officer Cinzia the name of this

house Valletta I don't think it has

anything to do with this if it's happen

to other places independent of us and

before we were here right on seems

pretty unrelated I agree and I think

that we also shouldn't risk pissing off

some

you know undead lawyer's office powerful

family situation the dwarf wants to work

out a deal the dwarf is kind of the one

that does the buying and selling over of

the footstool alright because like so

let's let's talk about your time as

guards let's I think six of you for two

weeks we can we can arrange that you

know work out like food and board and

stuff like that will be provided but

yeah you have six of your men stay here

for two weeks and then and they can say

this is where the chain of Akron is

staying perfectly safe would you have a

room I could set up surgery I don't

think we just we don't need to just in

case six of our people just in case

leech sleeps on the ship from now on the

the dwarf looks at you and says yeah he

turns back to you and says tell your

drow I do not talk to underworld errs

hola Lisa turns out this young man

doesn't talk to underworld errs yeah an

underworld er who are you asking the

door are you asking me yeah I am your

that's a reasonable conclusion aren't

you an underworld ER he pulls on an axe

[Music]

intimidate what do I get from it judge

[Music]

we've been through some [ __ ] alright and

we're trying to set up a job here so

take a breath have this bear will talk

to me this way

I like this my friends irritate you

don't want don't worry about this guys I

want that one

that one he starts picking out people to

be a part of the

tell you what I will make generally

points at issue I know he does yeah I

will make sure I want that one when we

have people this is where most the guys

are staying anyway so yeah non-issue are

we gonna pay for this oh no he's making

clear that you guys are people that he's

saying he's gonna be putting us up but

but the exchange you guys are gonna stay

here and the implication by the way is

that if a [ __ ] goes down here in the

next two weeks that you guys are on the

hook for what you mean on the hook like

you're the guards yeah in those days

this one judge this is by the way

exactly the kind of thing we're looking

for so no money grant is a hairless

stone giant got gaunt face and when you

met him he was just completely freaking

out and really wanted the cops to do

something wanted he wanted to kill

somebody he a whole bunch of people had

just died he was seeing his business

kind of go up in smoke and no one wanted

to come here but now he's calmed down a

lot he got to yell at officer Cinzia

that made him feel better and you're

offering to be to serve as the taverns

guards for the next couple of weeks and

so now he's a lot more approachable in

business life and his his earlier rage

filled the demeanor his soft the red has

gone out from his eyes he's gone back to

being a civilized creature and when the

Noles are done it's almost like

nothing's happened here like the dwarf

has to go by and I put all the tables

back about the Noles have gotten the

bodies out and the Noles have scrubbed a

lot of the blood they put this like

white powder down that fizzes and then

they scrub it clean and and then when

they're when they're done takes about an

hour and a half and they go upstairs and

they go out to all the other rooms and

they take it's a big pile of bodies it's

everybody that was here last night that

wasn't a chain member and a couple of

members of the chain

hmm six people sometimes um who are

those guys I know may not know I know

what they are but what what are they

what I've never seen him before

the dwarf you know Chester's over his

shoulder is like Knights oilmen I

haven't they clean up dead bodies or

something and the Knights oil

yeah you know the when people dump their

their buckets out the window oh oh okay

YUM mm-hmm better them than me mm-hmm he

says I wonder the city stinks we should

look into that yeah so at this point

Angel shows up nice and he is dressed

like a short ryeowon that's why he is

the last time you saw him he was wearing

he was wearing he was a halfling wearing

the uniform of the chain of Akron and

now he is even though he's you know

three feet tall he is dressed like a

ryokan Doble nice he's got like the tiny

little version of Boots's boots he's got

a crazy [ __ ] hat on peacock feathers

coming out of it Angley look amazing is

it fancy dress today he takes his hat

off and puts it on the table and he says

we are not working for House baletta I'm

gonna pick up the Hat and check it out

this is a really nice hat he tells you

where you got he's like I bought it and

tells the district he's like I've been

all through the city I'm gonna I'm just

gonna like try it on how does it doesn't

fit as a halfling it's happy it's it's

you know

[Music]

so yeah he's like he's like he's like I

spent the last two days in the city

trying to figure it's but it's a crazy

[ __ ] City but I've learned a lot so

where someplace we can talk

we're stuck here in the to shoes is like

hey you were supposed to be here

yesterday morning it's like I was busy

speaking of which we want to establish

that moving forward we try to check in

at least once a day so we don't do a

searching for anybody in case they're

dead sure yeah great it send a message

doesn't have to show up right if we

don't wait a sentiment so let's go back

to the dreamers dream into uh I guess my

room they have they have like meeting

rooms it's like a modern it's it doesn't

look like a modern hotel it looks like a

fantasy Egyptian hotel but they have

meeting rooms at ballrooms a lot of them

are well they have the yeah they have

private rooms where people can do

business and sign contracts and stuff

like that and that's it's actually let's

just go back to the ship okay we have a

meeting room there yeah you got lots of

rooms on yeah on the dark dream let's go

talk about there this is this is a youth

drop-in there yeah that's true yeah

who's apparently scarred me was so

cynical untrusting everything that does

and I propped that up I brought that

youtube comment and Lars is like you're

the only DM I've known subterfuge and

double-dealing from you have you have

you told the story of how you turn

robbie against me okay yes that's larvas

baseline for playing D&D is that the DM

is hey do you have Reds mini and you're

like oh anyway excuse me pardon me

mm-hmm yeah who knows what Twitter's

well ours would have been like an a

player if he'd had a nice dungeon master

it wasn't manipulative and scheming and

evil hmm I think I think what most

people don't get is I just don't swallow

so that's just because Matt's a [ __ ]

doesn't mean I don't have fun with the

game I'll have you know I am NOT a

[ __ ] I'm oh oh wait mask

a bit both really so you got your birth

listen we've got Dini to play yeah read

what it says though it says we we so

that you guys head back to the somnium

to neveress which again like you guys

just spent time there and so this is

starting to feel more like home than the

Pharaohs dream certainly which is this

very exotic and strange place to stay

and you've only spent I think one night

in the Pharaoh's dream maybe two and so

yeah the somnium tenebrous is now the

closest thing you folks have no leech

kind of slip so from the back you're

gonna go tend to the ship so you guys at

some point you're headed toward one of

the one of the rooms on the ship and you

realize that leech isn't there and it's

it's there are other members of the

chaîne on the ship there's always a

contingent of like seven or eight

soldiers that maintain the ship and make

sure that we already established that

the the ship's the navigator can't

doesn't recognize individual members of

the turret it only knows like how many

life forms are on the ship and it can't

be fooled by the way can I teach it you

might be able to upgrade it well like so

for example if I were to take boots in

and stand him in front of the navigator

and say this is Bhutanese no that stuff

they like you even even like you

wouldn't you would know that that the

ship doesn't work that way based on the

time that you spent here for a while is

slave right but then after the rebellion

the gift warlord tried to do the same

thing and couldn't do it but there there

there's there might be a way to get the

navigator to recognize stuff but it

would need to be modified

mm-hmm-hmm yeah curator that's right

your apartment the curator is tomorrow

by the way mmm well tom ties it now noon

close to me afternoon

all right let's talk angel angel so

angel has standby angel has his report

to cool he starts pulling out all these

notes and he's like I'm glad I did

enough to eat these things cuz who knows

what I happened if I got captured or I

got questioned or something and he

starts grabbing all these like and you

see his halfling is really he writes in

a surprisingly delicate fine script not

entirely unlike Elise yeah little scraps

of paper that he's written notes on and

he dumps them all on the table and he's

like that's a crazy [ __ ] city here's

what's going on the city's it's big it's

huge you got no idea unless you pay for

a tap a tapestry flying carpet thing you

smell one of those yeah you kick they're

expensive they cost like ten gold a pop

right and some one of the one of the

kids has like has the whole industry on

lockdown right so there's one guy

controls all the town all the tapestries

in the city unless you take flying

carpet or wherever you call them you

can't cross the city in a day you can

hire a coach and get around a district

but as soon as you try and leave a

district unless you're a VIP you're

talking about spending a couple of hours

in line getting around is for rich

people basically I don't know he's like

he's looking at this huge all these

little scraps of paper you pick it up

he's like I don't know where to start

you know that dot letter well remember

that oh that yeah you like we're not

working for where you think we're

working for but he's like he can't find

that note right then and he picks up

when he's like remember those guys I

wasn't there for this but those kids you

got to dust up with yeah right remember

that cop that showed up that was at the

inn and they didn't she didn't do

anything didn't rescue uh cop saw it no

one got arrested you guys use a magic in

the city you know why you know why no

one got busted anybody got a guess she's

not a cop that's a good guess everyone

thinks we're working for house Verona

yeah the guys that run the Navy remember

remember that ship that stopped us and

did the inspection

nothing happened on the inspection they

just led us through yeah they did that

on purpose

because they wanted everyone to think

that we work for them huh huh huh wonder

why they're waiting to see who comes to

hire us mmm right no because they're

trying to set something up where people

think we work for them and then anyone

who comes to hire us that's how they

know who their allies are but see I

don't think that I I don't think that's

gonna work is I don't think those guys

are that sophisticated right I think

some of these some of these Great Houses

they sort of guessed the house Bironas

is bluffin and we don't really work for

them mmm anyway so those guys they run

the Navy right they run the Imperial

Navy all right and they run this big

military academy right everybody in the

city goes to this Academy most of the

high ranking officers in the city went

there so it's like it's crazy how things

work even people who were enemies in

opposing houses they both went to the

same military academy so they just ask

each other like hey what do they go to

dinner together and stuff they've got

this whole basically house verona runs

this whole like intelligence agency

they've got this whole network of people

anybody that graduates with military

academy they can get in touch with and

even when they're someone on the other

side it doesn't occur to them to just

like keep their mouths shut

they've got some kind of like crazy

gentleman's agreement it would be it

would be not the done thing it would be

uncivilized to answer a question if it

came from another graduate they even got

a ring they called the old school ring

that everybody wears these are all the

different like anybody with anyone like

a military rank went to this academy and

they've got a ring can they come out the

other end with a ring and so as a result

these guys that run they don't just run

the navy right they also end up having

this crazy intelligence agency inside

the city and people that work for the

enemy houses we'll just tell them stuff

that they shouldn't tell them cuz if

they got the ring no like a part of the

secret society yeah yeah that's exactly

anyway that's how house Bruna bits until

everyone in this city runs some kind of

spy network and a lot of them have their

own cops like private armies as soon as

I started asking around I could tell I

was brushing up against some like heavy

infrastructure like I had to be careful

what I asked because they were watching

me well the cops we dealt with are owned

by house Verona no like like the Marines

and you've seen a bunch of guys like in

breastplates they're a bunch of them at

the customs but they're all there all

through the city

the Marines work for house for the gold

buttons they work for the fulcrum they

work for the assayer's guilt they were

for the money people is fulcrum and ass

hears about the same thing yeah so yeah

anyway house Barona right they run the

Navy that gives them a lot of power but

they don't run the trade trade is all

done privately ships like the ship we're

on the raw so whatever Rosso Cielo the

Navy just guards them guarantee safe

passage until they decide they don't

wanna which so this is the thing right

everyone's sort of waiting for that to

happen everybody in the city knows

there's gonna be a war just no one knows

when it's gonna start and a lot of

people think it's gonna start here in

the States that sooner or later house

Bruna's going to stop guaranteeing trade

and the fulcrum is gonna be screwed it

doesn't make any sense everybody talks

about the coming the war that's gonna

happen no one seems worried about it

everyone thinks it's gonna be a great

adventure half of them are looking to

make money off of it the other half are

waiting to write some kind of grand

opera cities full of [ __ ] writers and

actors that I Bironas run he's got all

he's starting to organize his notes into

different piles and each pile is like a

different faction in the city right and

he's almost through the pile of house

Verona stuff

Duke Marco right he's the Lord of the

Admiralty everybody seems to think that

guys are pretty straight dude they act

like like he doesn't really have

ambition right he doesn't want to be in

the next Prince but I don't know that I

buy that because the dude is the head

of this great house right he's a Navy

guy he's already manipulated everybody

in the [ __ ] city into thinking that we

work for him and he didn't even do

anything

that was DeMarco yeah that was his

nephew right that's how everybody

everybody is related to somebody here

everybody's somebody's nephew or cousin

or sister in law or something so you

gotta be careful you're talking to

because half the time you're talking to

somebody works for the opposite faction

you think they're working for me and

that zone the Navy's Duke Marcos main

rival or whatever is shoroma she runs

the she runs the fulcrum a quick quick

question for you man are we gonna get

the paper that you have in front of us I

don't all right yeah yeah of course

okay cool so look so I don't have to

take notes yeah yeah okay right this is

a lot to write you have all the

information there anyways this is just

an opportunity for guys to ask questions

and Angel know like oh like half the

people in the city don't give a [ __ ]

about Ajax half them don't even think

the guy's real like he's this he's

something you read about in the papers

he's just like entertainment no cuz like

a couple years ago the prince died right

right so he starts drawing like a rough

map of the city it's basically his

version of the map I use very little

detail but he starts drawing like here's

you can it's like a pie it's circular

and there are wedges in the pie and each

wedge is run by a different faction but

there's all these bits of the city that

aren't run by anybody and it's like

almost half the city isn't run by

anybody and he's like the prince used to

run all this stuff Yeah right and his

he's dead his house is gone right so

everyone's waiting for someone to grab

start grabbing some of the stuff and

when that happens and the war is on

mm-hmm

so we've grabbed it yeah Tom Scavo I'm

just kidding what are the two arbitrary

it's like [ __ ] commander the chain

right our own Kingdom yeah

question the princess have been doing

this entire yeah so they're all over the

city right but they're all like waiting

- waiting for the Privy Council to tell

them what to do but the preview consul

like they never they never they haven't

passed a vote in like five years because

they don't agree on anything anymore

right because that's how the Prince had

to admit the guilds and the guilds don't

however the noble houses vote mm-hmm the

guilds both the opposite they haven't

passed in legislation like three years

they voted on anything so all these all

these soldiers in any points these

different places in the city they're

just sitting around waiting for someone

to tell them what to do

so what happens if somebody makes a move

in one of these places where these guys

gonna no one knows no one knows what

they're gonna do are they gonna defend

the Prince of property maybe maybe not

maybe they just stand aside so no one

wants to be the first one to act right

because as soon as somebody acts they're

the bad guys

so that's one want somebody else to be

the bad guy so the stays is that

included in this sort of luck pie yeah

the stays the stays is an island and it

is controlled by the fulcrum and they

are a great house they bought their way

up the entire stay so like where we were

where boots and our guys were attacked

yeah that wasn't neutral territory that

wasn't the princes territory that was no

no the princess territory is there's a

there's maybe only one other island that

is considered part of capital it's

smaller and it's quasi connected

depending on which map you looked at

like that one guy's map you drew that I

really liked if that's the official map

that it's probably connected but it's

like maybe by a thin bridge it's it's a

quarter of the size of the stays it

stays is about as big as Manhattan mm-hm

and it is heavily populated part of the

city it's got its own districts but it

is principal the princess territory

there's no no faction controls that yet

is that where that library was amiss you

know yep

not a missing elf missing career elf elf

was the dude who was trying to hire you

guys oh if there's other two places that

were attacked were like what parts or

what territories they were attacked what

attack were you talking about

father Jack and his shadow a type what

shot the the end boot stayed in last

night some of the boys got attacked by

some shadows no [ __ ] yeah

that's happened in two other places we

well we finished up the Underdark job we

had a you know had some wine and called

it a night

woke up right before the crack of dawn

with three shadows standing over my bed

ended up ended up taking out about a

dozen people in the end a couple of our

men

it's you okay which of our men

you tell yeah oh these the ones that I

recognized yet Wiesel and Johnson boss

the thing is sure like that happens all

the time in this [ __ ] City like it's

just I just read the broadsheets

what spectrum in Earth's shadow I mean

they're demons sometimes there was like

things come up from below from the

layers they call it the city under the

city she like that happens all the time

you got to read the broadsheets it's all

over the place what's your opinion on

the broadsheets and just on the guild

behind it and then as a source of

information okay so the broadsheets well

we're getting hang on he's got a whole

pile up he's like I get confused man so

yeah sure owe me she runs this whole

place he means this place that we're in

that's fulcrum yeah Estates yeah yeah

she runs the stays she sets prices she

handles a currency exchange she's sort

of like the head of all the guilts and

she's a noble now right she bought her

way in she bought in a noble title and

she and Duke mark oh right that's House

Brona that's the Navy they find all the

time sometimes like they fight in the

streets like they had cost each other

and they have these shouting matches and

everyone stands around and writes it all

down and then ends up in the broadsheets

wait literally the like the duke and

yeah oh yeah wait wait wait so this is

he means like shouting matches they know

right yes huge arguments this island is

part of her territory

but he is in charge of the docks in her

territory he's and he runs the Navy

right so he doesn't own any of the land

here his fat he points to the map and

he's like this is all

how's road like this is there manor

house and it's in the city proper but

keep his boats protect the trade hmm so

his guys are all over the docks right

right like capital trades with everybody

in the world that's where they make all

their money and if it wasn't for the

Navy there'd be pirates everywhere you

wouldn't be able to get a ship in or out

without getting boarded and the Navy

guarantees passage Duke is it Duke Marco

or Duke Duke Marco Verona is the Lord of

the Admiralty okay

imagine how much a good pirate could

make boss quantities on the city and uh

sure about this big van a gariand guard

oh lava

she wants to make her point about

something she sends this lady she's like

seven feet Oh remember that dude who

showed up when we were going through

customs and just sat there and watched

yep yeah darn guy yeah I just did there

didn't say I think that sure Oh mais

nephew seems oh she everybody here

somebody's a nephew or niece or

daughter-in-law

he runs the Oei the office of exchange

integrity right they're spies he's the

head of the spy network he's watching us

he's been watching us ever sees probably

been watching us ever since we entered

the city probably watches everybody

mm-hmm okay so show me runs the DA he's

going through his notes runs of Doster

runs the bank I mean there are a lot of

banks in the city right but she runs the

main one she wants to exchange she runs

the money she's one of the most powerful

people in the city and she's not really

interested in anything except getting

more money but Marco the Duke house

Barona doesn't trust that he figures

that she wants to be Prince just like

everybody else you know you don't claw

your way up from being a hit Garen here

in capital and become the richest person

in the city without having ambition okay

here's something no one knows what

happened to Duke Maximo right the job

you took that crown yeah like how did

that guy die why can't they resurrect

him nobody knows but I think

we had something to do with it hmm all

right they're all dead but they can't

but he's lying yeah huh cuz she's when

it came out on top all that that guy

dying meant the city didn't get any

money no more taxes coming in because

his house runs the taxes and what

happens sure owe me waltzes in spends a

ton of cash and now she's in charge of

the guild she's got an open house sent

didn't we fight dude it that was him

well we could visit a memory it was a

memory of yeah there's a memory of him

yeah I mean like that it was like the

Lord of madnesses memory consciously

mm-hmm let me go then why why did they

send us to get the crown who are you

working for yeah

so that dead guy you guys met mm-hmm he

didn't work for housefull huh who does

he work for

he works for house I'll borrow Alvaro

yeah by the way that was easy to find

out that ain't a secret wait house

Alvaro leave we heard that name before

okay so so he's the guy Duke Prospero

runs that house he's one everyone thinks

is gonna be the next Prince right mmm I

should have named this episode the name

of this episode is Angel's report I just

realized I should named it huge input of

stuff you guys have been trying to find

out like judge was trying to find this

out out of Bush questions you were

trying to get this info from guests oh

this is that kind of let me tell you

what's going on in the city but keep in

mind this is all from angels point of

view well said Alvaro who's the joke

that runs that losing Prospero cross or

Prospero Prospero orderly what everyone

thinks he's gonna be the next print he

thinks he also the other thing is I

believe we know that Gianna Alvaro is

anti-age axe

or they says what was written in the

broadsheets yeah that's probably true

yeah a lot of the noses are anti Ajax

and the guilts kind of don't care

so yeah this guy the guy who hired the

who's law firm that is he wants house

Valletta right on his side everyone in

the city he points the little map you

drew on the table everyone in the city

one's house bullet on their side but the

lady the the the dead lady

she's just sitting there in a manor

house like a [ __ ] spider in a web she

never leaves are just interesting so

they get they get the crown presented to

house Valletta as a gift - yeah it's

[ __ ] politics man yeah they're trying

to make another trying to get her out

they're trying to get her to take a side

and they're like hey look what we got

we found these [ __ ] mercenaries go

with her squid ship go into the

Underdark grab the crown well similarly

I mean that's what the job that Norfolk

had for us which was to find some holy

identity of - Romi to try and woo her

and some another no no no it's the

opposite no cuz that guy Abbot nah free

whatever and he's with the Church of st.

polari oh yeah that's house Navarre

[ __ ] house Navarre now controls the

Citadel it wheats this pile of notes

okay so wait where we talk about the

dead lady right they call her wood nor

the Duchess Lenore right she's got a

whole dead city the whole district he

points they're all dead

everybody that lives and works they're

all dead it's like a literally a giant

mausoleum in the middle of the city it's

[ __ ] crazy City man yeah am i it's

like his biggest black bottom this is

gray mist over the whole place nothing

grows there and normal people people

still work there

business goes on yeah wait yeah where

they did when I was here last no it all

happened CJ yeah well you could like

just when you arrived you can just

seeing like flying carpets as taxis

flying around yeah I mean there's been a

huge a huge shift so I think Edisto told

us this the guys on the boat we were on

talked about how like she's waiting for

her dead husband to return uh she says

that's like the reason she doesn't get

involved everyone every time somebody

asked her for an alliance or for some of

the tax money that she's like that she's

like well when my husband returns dot

dot dot but I don't know I don't write

her husband being dude maximum yeah that

guy's dead a dead guy so is the crap oh

the proper that he's really that she's

real he's really dead so shield then

have to pick a side because she want to

excuse for an action anymore right I

don't know what they want with that

thing except I think they think they can

use it to make an alliance with her I

think they're afraid that she wants to

be the next printer yeah princess or

whatever and she's waiting for everyone

else tap a war and then once they're all

spent then she'll come out of her you

know dead city and then she'll be in

charge so how is okay you asked about

house I'll borrow the guys we are

working for turns out this guy runs the

university which is like a couple dozen

different schools and colleges including

the War College including College of

sorcery this dude the guy reserves the

people with the Rings

no that's the Academy no any points to

where it is in the city like this the

Military Academy is the War College of

War College is like it's where all the

nobles from all over the planet all send

their best they're their oldest kids

because they want to learn how to be

diplomats and statesmen yeah prosper

Alvaro graduated with honors in the War

College and then he signed up as a

freshman of college a sorcery the guy's

like that was 30 years ago the guy's one

of the most powerful mages in the city

hmm

that's why that dead lawyer [ __ ] got

us the appointment with the magic shop

because he runs half the magic in the

city it's the guy who are working for

the lawyers his his name original Orfeo

yeah okay that that's actually his name

it's not like that yeah he's got a whole

firm he runs a law firm why is that

undead dude no work or at the undead

lady man I don't know all right

like okay oh there we just got attacked

by a bunch of shot by a bunch of undead

shadows I don't think they work with a

dead lady though he's going through his

notes looking for what what have I

already said Derry talked about this so

the Chancellor of the University and oh

yeah okay so remember I said every one

in the city runs their own spy network

well the princes spy network which is

like not the city it's like global was

run from inside the college and this guy

now runs the college so I think the

princess by Network is reporting to him

mmm that's it's called the acting school

that's maximum I know that's Prospero

Alvaro Prospero I was it máximos the

dead

yeah lady's dead husband how is it all

the way dead so yeah so of all the

nobles this guy Prospero Alvaro he's

kind of shaked wait did I did I mention

yeah this guy went to school with Ajax

hmm like they graduated together that's

why he's ringing the bell against Ajax

cuz he's like Ajax can win I know is it

fair to say that it sounds like most of

the noble houses are against Ajax and

the guilds are kind of like yeah it

could be big good for business yeah oh

yeah that's exactly but see I don't know

like Alvaro he's super he hates Ajax

he's terrified he thinks the guy's gonna

conquer the planet right so the other

nobles they all say the same thing but

why do they say that do they say that

because he says that maybe maybe maybe

they believe it maybe they could be

convinced otherwise I don't know man

it's just been two days for me everybody

knows what Prospero wants he wants to be

the next Prince he doesn't make a secret

about it he wants to bring the Guild's

to heel

although I mean I think that ship has

sailed and he wants to stop here Jax so

his main rival but also sort of his ally

is Duke Orsino right

how's Navarre he's the archbishop he

runs the church right he runs a lot of

the church doesn't on all of them and

there's like if you live here you know

which is which but I don't but that

church st. Claire yo the aspirant those

guys work or how's Navarre ajx could

concert conquer this place easy yeah

with

Serpent's tongues rather than swords so

much division there's a ton of churches

in this [ __ ] City some of them are

independent they fight each other some

of them are lying I can't keep them

apart but all the churches basically do

it house Navarre says so this guy is

crazy power because he's like the

religious leader like the dead lady if

this guy decides that she's a problem

she ain't gonna be a problem anymore

well you haven't defined any churches

that maybe operate a little bit more

quietly no ball I mean there are some

what is it but I don't I I mean the

that's the thing is that there's the

city's full of secrets mm-hmm you said

Navarre if they decide that the lady is

a problem she won't be no house no more

yeah yeah because they were on the

church right big all these Knights they

got priests they roll their role into

the Dead City and you know they do the

thing you do know more on deaths what a

guy was from Donegal I could just go in

high-level Erickson evaporate all of

them yeah so so this arsenal

guy the archbishop the guy that runs the

church he's sort of like the dead lady

he's like maybe number two in the city

but he's not going to do anything he's

gonna wait for someone else do something

I think he's waiting to come in and

clean up after some other groups go at

it some so that so to be clear the the

the thing that's gonna spark the war is

somebody trying to take the princes

territory that's what they says yeah

everybody knows it's gonna happen what

what if we took those territories that's

what I said earlier yeah does that

happen we would start a wolf sir we

don't have an army to fight it's no but

like here's the thing right so let's say

we do something like what the what the

alien guys talking about we piss off a

lot of people but there be the people

that those guys don't like they're on

our side

mm-hmm so we just got to figure out what

that is right

well who's who might be pissed off at us

right now I mean I don't think anybody

like everyone in the city is sort of

waiting to see what we do we're just

being used yeah no one no one what it

takes everyone's super interested like

you go to it you go to the right bar and

people are talking about the chain of

Akron but no one wants to hire us yet

they all want to see which way things

are gonna break gotcha

you said Olsen I was number two in the

sea yeah or yeah if there's no one Oh

prosper Oliver like that guy's a head of

the note he's like okay he's like you

know he's not just the highest ranking

Noble he's one of the richest men in the

city got it and he's like I'm taking off

my I'm taking off my angel hat and

putting on Matt Koval talking hat yeah

he's like an 18th level magicus Oh got

it

okay so then there's the fun right

mm-hmm

the broadsheet guild yeah everyone in

the city reads the broadsheets yeah

right

no one believes everything they read but

they believe a lot so they got a lot of

power but I don't think they know what

to do with it

the broadsheets are only like three

years old they're still seen as this new

thing but no one can really remember a

time before everyone was reading the

broadsheets

they're run by a course area named nan

something woman yeah she was a noble in

Corsair so she's like the most of the

guilds she like understands house of our

own house Navarre the best but she

doesn't seem to care she's like an

engineer she invented the press she just

wants to tinker with it she's a tinkerer

her editor runs the paper yeah name's

Hal oh sorry

that guy has a lot of power he works for

enon but they're basically partners you

say gemstone Dragonborn mm mm-hmm

she makes the papers he decide what goes

up right I think he used to be a

playwright

then there's the rasp and he kind of

points to the skies

Gilda farriers they run all the

transport like they've always been

powerful but then they got some new head

of the guild a guy from alloy and a guy

imports these flying carpets and now

these guys have a ton of power it calls

himself Lord cashmere and it's like the

broad shields a man yeah it's like the

broadsheets man know that everyone talks

about how the city's not gonna be the

same again no no he's a fire yeah I

don't know yeah like a chin or what

re-consent yeah one of them that guy is

rich but no one seems to know what he

wants seems like he just wants to be a

me enjoy being rich and being a normal

it spends a lot of money on the Arts

okay so that's the seven oh yeah so all

these great houses right in the guilds

each of them control their own district

I think he already covered that I

covered the Prince yeah

there's like a million organizations in

this [ __ ] City does the order the

dragon cross there's a high tower and

they all seem to have a lot of power but

they don't seem to care about who runs

the city so just because you're not one

of these great houses doesn't mean

you're not important you just don't care

about who runs the city and there's this

organization I don't know who they are

maybe maybe nobody does they're called

the Lords of capital I don't know if

that's a real thing but people talk

about them like they're the real thing

alvaro is definitely one of them but

maybe not because he runs a great house

maybe because he's this magic user it

might just be something people say but

they talk about you know the Lords of

capital won't let that happen or the

Lords of capital will stop that and when

I asked when I listen I realize they're

not talking about the heads of the gilts

I'm not talking about the nobles they're

talking about like the heads of these

secret societies and stuff and like it's

the Illuminati well you like a slim

expresses that in a way that he's like

yeah yeah so who knows who these guys

are the Lords of Capitol lavarro is

definitely one of them

so he's like that's what I that's what I

was able to find out everything I told

you man you can find this out easy

anybody models done stuff yep

leach appears back in the room did I

miss it

[Laughter]

you off strands or so in I could have

found out a lot more if I had like real

resources wait oh you need it oh honey

cache amen we got to be careful we got

to be careful because like half the

people in the city I think we're spies

for the other half I don't know when

your network how many men I want you

coming spare we have anybody that's good

with not many you know yeah we need

people who know how to ask the right

questions and know how to listen people

who can sit in the corner and just find

out things but we've we've posted up at

the footstool tavern now maybe we could

use that as a as a recruiting tool get

some 70 years out there yeah see I don't

I think the whole like I think it's

gonna be a while before we can recruit

anybody mm-hmm right we gotta really

like right now we're just seen as a

mercenary company but we need like a

base we need some good press mm-hmm and

then when people see if you don't even

know who are working for you it's like

they don't even sounds like this yeah

the broad cheese would be Kuwait go

right is it halas ah sorry could get to

them him whatever they are

since somehow and get something

favorable in the broad seas another

chain I yeah we I think we got to keep

doing jobs cuz you know get her name out

there at some point we got stop stop

taking jobs we're gonna start making

moves so who was that mercenary company

and the project's shooting star yeah

those guys are [ __ ] don't pay

attention to that name oh no because

they're just a bunch of random

at the church hire it's the church the

church or behind the church took that

[ __ ] citadel oh by the way hmm

yeah there's not pirates in that citadel

man it was demons it was some kind of

cult taken over the Citadel and these

guys wouldn't cleared it out mm-hmm it's

the church that's back in them that's

why they were able to do it the church

gave them some kind of like weapons and

stuff silver or whatever demons right

not Devils I don't know man I can't tell

him partner not the not the you kind the

other kind but to their point they're

getting good press in the broadsheets

like that we also just caught it not

caught up in something which I write

about in the broadsheets about us so our

names aren't even in there twice listen

we've got the this part of the equation

right now we now we can do the some you

know high profile [ __ ] off job and what

we call we call it the other half we

can't promote the job we did in the

world under contract you don't need to

know you got what you needed from that

which was a [ __ ] ton of money nobody

nobody here would care about that

because that's in the world below about

[ __ ] outside the city yeah so yeah so

angels advice is we need to keep taking

jobs because we want good press but at

some point we got stopped taking jobs we

can start you got stopped working for

other people yeah I start doing our own

[ __ ] because once that happens then

we'll start recruiting people will want

to write they'll want to come out on the

way puts it they want to come out on the

winning side right now we're not one of

the players in the city sure

well let me arrive then left yes I City

what would you need to to be able to

keep your ear to the ground for the next

two weeks or so I don't know like five

guys five guys and maybe maybe 3,000

gold I got to buy people off don't got

to find people it's like everyone knows

anybody in this city is paying attention

to anything knows who I am

those who I work for so we got to find

people that don't work for anybody no

one gives a [ __ ] about and then I got to

find go-betweens so those people no one

knows they're working for us

hmm it takes time it cost money I I

think we do it yeah all right we could

spare five guys we can spare three

thousand gold just so what do you want

to know well we're gonna be taking jobs

we're gonna want to know who are the

best people wedding jobs what pieces

move when we take side jobs okay

what are they crowd yeah what even with

that crowd what are the results of that

kind of stuff yeah see if we just waited

like two days I could have told you who

that lawyer works for uh everybody knows

nobody knows he's not house paletas

lawyer yeah yeah he just let us think he

was house full of his lawyer cuz he's

dead yeah well you never explicitly said

so either right so we just yeah same

point we just assumed that you missus

some points they're at a death Oh

maybe mentioned it or something but you

didn't say we were looking at the crown

of house Valletta but either way I was a

crown did that job we did that job

because it was a big payout yeah we

needed money

yeah it's situated yeah it's a good job

you said it's a good job all right so

yeah uh and you tell me you tell me what

you want to know and you're not gonna

fix two jobs that that we end up taking

if we piss anybody off yeah yeah it'd be

good to know it's good learning place

yeah I can find that out you're good to

know before they send shades to come so

what's next

it also be let's make sure that Alvaro

knows that were no friends of Ajax I

don't know how we get that to him but we

need a means to yeah I can get that

information probably but he should

already know if he reads the broadsheets

because that was the first thing that we

said when we didn't people can't trust

the broadsheets and if anybody's not gas

time it's gonna be those noble houses

yeah just cuz it's in the broadsheets

don't mean anything in fact a lot of

people if it's in broadsheets they just

assume the opposite mm-hmm right because

a lot of people plant stuff and

broadsheets on purpose so I guarantee

you there are people thinking that's

what we did and weari ruled in here and

so we're we're we hate H acts that some

people take that as a signal that maybe

we mean the opposite

because we would never come out and say

something like that is what they think

and then half the other people are like

no I bet they do a thx it's a double

bluff all right you got to know how to

read it like we just got here it's gonna

take a while but pretty soon I think

he'll be able to decode this stuff yeah

it probably wouldn't hurt to let that

information out there

in a way there's a mic well - true -

alvaro yeah

we signed and at the broadsheets I don't

know how to use that [ __ ] we can figure

out how to use their [ __ ] what was that

sound again

when you say [ __ ] in in you don't mean

like a tavern to me yeah everybody just

has an end right yep yeah that's like

we're just saying that the giant

watching or anyone a leak

you want to leak you want me to leak who

you know who we want to kill right Ajax

is wizard mmm

you want me to leave that to a house of

our own

yep anyone who you want to contact with

house are that should be easy

just find a [ __ ] reporter I can trust

never know what you say Neera no no not

him find another one easier please

reporter well I loosed her others so

there's the thing about the broadsheets

right like they deliver they print these

things three times a day right and they

had they got all these people working

for mostly kids they got these people

all through the city delivering these

papers everybody comes up they give them

a couple of copper they got a paper

sorry this is all through the whole city

right nobody thinks about it but these

kids selling papers they hear things

mm-hmm so I think the broadsheets have

their own spy network inside the city no

one even knows it so maybe you got to

talk to some of those kids we figure

something out well with 3,000 gold I'm

sure you can probably convince some of

them so I can do this right but just let

you know it's gonna be dangerous like

right now

boots has given me orders I can go and

do it but we're the newest smallest spy

network in this place everyone else is

bigger

and they're not going to like me poking

around so suddenly I show up with my

throat slit you're gonna know why you

don't know contacts in the city you know

I mean contacts in the city is something

kind of underground and oh yeah but

3,000 cool yeah give me a couple days

when we're giving him five Shane a chain

right mm-hmm to go with him

leak your house talk to these are gonna

be like this is gonna be a it's mmm this

is gonna be like a domain action all

right so this is Kingdoms and warfare

stuff where your your nascent

organization is gonna start taking realm

actions and one of them is gonna be

we're starting spy network Oh

step one we've spent some money we start

a spy network and then we try to use it

to spy on these people and they're gonna

be right now your spy network is very

tiny but it's well-funded so you're

gonna make rolls at some point once it

comes back talk to they broadsheets one

spy masters cloak please try again the

kid style is a spy network it's classic

yeah I would see the thing is they can't

know that I'm digging yes they are a

spying network then they're just gonna

report back but I'm trying to plan

information you got to be careful let's

stop writing up too much we make do we

like pick a next job focus on that one

information well we're gonna keep doing

work but we need to be we need to be

moving stuff in the city wall where we

also need to know who we're doing work

for yeah that's been a problem it's kind

of like when we were playing last time

an orb Altair I was I was doing this

with Sigrid hmm

but you guys weren't a part of that so

yeah secret had his own spy network run

by a coral Lamplighter yeah that was

cool I wish we I wish we kept doing that

yes yeah - Korra brought like I had my

friend Geordi made a bunch of like

dossiers of prisoners if she's like

here's a bunch of people I think we

should you pick who you want and we'll

bust I'll bust him out and this will be

how we recruit people

and Laura's like this guy seems like a

cool [ __ ] like okay I'll get that guy

and then we went to the Underdark

everything changed and we stopped having

fun so eight names one wants to know who

we're working for next like what's

what's on offer that's we can talk about

that we get back from break but you guys

also have a visit to the curator yeah so

we're gonna take a break a bio break and

in roughly 10 minutes maybe 13 minutes

we will come back and if I I wanted to I

wish I could break I wish we should stop

streaming and then start another stream

as soon as we come back we're not gonna

do that that'd be ridiculous but I would

want to do that so that we could name

the second stream the shopping episode

so we will be back in about 13 minutes

thank you for listening to me monologue

for basically an hour hopefully that

doesn't have to happen again

ooh ixnay on the ocodile-cray

[Music]

if you have a Amazon Prime subscription

you get a free twitch prime sub every

month you can throw it to your favorite

twitch streamer boom hi baby

maybe you're watching good yeah this

Bill's awesome you gotta live free so

that's right and we're already starting

we're doing who wanted me to give it to

you we are already working quite hard

getting both on design and getting art

for the next Kickstarter which I am

pretty excited by kingdoms the book is

gonna be called kingdoms in warfare but

I think the Kickstarter is going to call

the kingdoms organizations in marker

because I want people to know what's in

the book and a lot of it is gonna be

organizations and rules for stuff like

hey I want to run a Thieves Guild or we

want to all play a Thieves Guild or we

want all play a order of knights and

having designed there that Shores up

like hey if we're thieves guild should

we have like a priest or something

without having a multi-class that's the

idea that's one of the ideas if that

sounds interesting and you want a

notification when Kickstarter goes live

there's

notification get a send us your email

there's an exclamation point command

thing in the chat and you can sign up

and we will email you only once and say

hey the kickstart is live we won't sell

your email to anybody we won't spam you

or any of that stuff and one of the

things that is incredibly rewarding

about what we do is the fact that it

inspires some people to create art and

that continues to amaze me this is a

reference to what me not being able to

remember the word for because quite a

bit ugly slim but it also does look a

lot like the cover of the fiend folio I

think they even mentioned that in the in

the copy of the tweet they said it's

like a little homage to the theme folio

it's basically canon now that two-shoes

is just in a armor so cool I feel like

we're getting out like a freeman is

attacking sword it's like this curvy

sword yeah we all this is great the face

in the second panel oh my goodness

yeah the game is getting the game has

it's up to Tom's fault yeah this person

had did a couple pieces one of judge

that I thought this was great yeah I

take my employee like a dress though a

little coconut yeah this people seem to

get heavy

reaction entirely localized here in your

room Facebook's expressions we made it

was cold

thanks for the fantastic art it is

hugely inspiring for us we share it and

talk about it all the time and it is one

of the things that helps motivate us to

keep doing this so anyway I believe you

folks like so that's angels report you

guys are on the somnium to numerous you

guys are free to a null feels like he

knows what you want him to do although

you may have to decrement the treasury

guy to pay for it

but that's something i would you figure

out 3000 gold well we'll see it may just

be you make a test and the treasury dye

is a modifier but that's something I'm

gonna have to think about and he's gonna

try and get leak some information and

find out the like next time you guys

take a job between talking to the person

and saying yes he's gonna go try to

figure out who does this person really

work for mm-hmm because that could be

useful like you didn't really know who

the dead guy worked for but it didn't

turn out to be that big a deal so it's

nothing in the world but does he know

who pursue viens live with of the

heraldic society you thinkin those guys

were actually working for never know all

right no but I can find out yeah look at

me like give me like 12 hours this is

the guys on the island right yeah give

me like 12 hours so don't say yes to

that guy yet but like don't say no

either right well we gotta go anyway not

to did you happen to come across the

knee of the teeth lean joshan's yeah

yeah there's teeth lens the whole like

nest of him that's down under her is it

under the ceiling

no where are they at he Matt doesn't

know which district they're in but angel

does any points that I use you can find

him but they're mostly like

homeless and beggars there there like a

lot of them are they don't have they

can't get jobs and there's some kind of

there's some kind of I don't know how

angel would put it yeah

there's some kind of drug that they're

all addicted to or that's what they say

I don't know if it's true right because

it seems like there was a lot of

prejudice against him it seems like a

lot of people would just like to get

like get rid of them and so it seems

like a crime opportunity for recruits

providing there sounds like a prime

opportunity to get paid a lot of money

well we could get rid of them by

recruiting them I mean to be fair if

anybody's gonna get rid of them it's

gonna be copper as vengeance for

drinkers arrow different hey game

doesn't is a tradition in my group

whoever won the last game does not get

to win the next game so yeah he's

willing to go do that and then it's up

to you guys whether or not you want to

go talk to the herald and say we're

interested in the job tell us more or

whether or not you want to go it's

tomorrow is your appointment with the

curator we can always wait tomorrow

maybe we should let the herald know now

that we're back from we need to talk

about your in weapons on that island

yeah cuz we're not gonna go over there

should get some details on on this job

anything we can and then will confer

with angel will confirm deny and in the

meantime we see how anybody else talks

to us today talk to the curator well you

guys gonna be on the ship because if so

it's gonna be hard so that's where the

rank and file guys who weren't at the SH

weren't aren't officers and weren't the

crew of the ship we're staying anyway

right we don't have to stay there no

that's part I do okay you stand on the

ship I'll probably keep staying at the

footstool just because I feel a bit

beholden to that whole situation so

they're happy to have you yeah do you do

any do you do any bardic stuff do you or

you do perform the function of a

troubadour do you tell stories sing

dance can you do dance tell them the

stories of Slim's greatness that world

yeah well it is uh it resists yeah how

could I I mean it is a it's a public

house right so in if so you know I'm not

gonna be spending all of my time I don't

know yeah I'm gonna be spending all of

my time just sort of drinking wanking

[Music]

yeah yeah yeah the fans want you to hang

out dishes so you know she helped me

fight off the ice he was I rolled a 34

yeah so so age will come report to you

at the footstool yeah when you find

something out and I feel like that's

it's a lower key operation for him doing

his kind of thing anyway yeah yeah like

if like if you ask one of the Pharaohs

dream he will but people will see that

Yeah right and when they might not

otherwise oh yeah I guess we gotta go to

the dream to talk to the pursuant to get

him to ya you pie have to tell the

concierge that you want to pay as this

dude he runs a society or something and

he'll have a runner he'll have a

messenger go get that guy but again it

means it's ours

so it's probably going to be tomorrow

quote-unquote okay before he comes back

it's unless unless somebody is in this

district it's gonna be difficult to get

an appointment with somebody like I hey

we want to talk to this guy and talk to

them that day like even if they want to

it's gonna be we have to send somebody

to like literally walk there and at that

point it's gonna be 5 o'clock and so

it'll be come tomorrow they get back I

keep putting that quotes as and maybe

tomorrow morning you might be tomorrow

afternoon you're not really you know if

control over when people show up Anna is

making a whole like you've got a whole

graph and a chart that's awesome um yeah

so

well that's tomorrow we have the

appointment yeah you're right you can

you can stay in the dream and eat they

have there's a like a there version

there's like a quartet that plays there

and maybe maybe somebody will come and

offer some alternate right choices for

jobs mm-hmm most yeah what's the best

restaurant in the barrios dream the best

restaurant is the hanging garden but

there's there's three restaurants and

the other the other two are smaller and

more boutique and they serve food from

other parts of the world but the hanging

garden serves kem hara cuisine but it's

made it's cooked with real and spices in

the railing manner because actual real

ones don't like food from that part of

the world yeah it's come hard fusion

cuisine fusion well I think unless

anybody is going to come talk to us

we're gonna proceed to the next day all

right yeah the evening passes uneventful

II more interesting people show up at

the Pharaoh's dream people from other

parts of the world who are quite

obviously wealthy and want people to

know it some of them are military

officers or diplomats some of them are

just incredibly rich all right have we

whenever we're there do we notice

anybody with that old class ring on that

angel described yeah sure is it like

pretty prolific or is it like if you're

a now you know what you're looking for

there's a handful of people here who

were wearing it's like a it's like a

high school ring except really expensive

they all seemed to kind of like greet

each other and are they yeah sure I mean

it's if you're just sitting there in one

of the like at the forty a you'll often

notice somebody's somebody's checking in

somebody's checking on they see each

other and they talk and they shake hands

and they have different uniforms on and

they have different if they're military

guys have different like awards

different metals that they're showing

off so it's not it's mean it's not like

a secret society no it's not it's not

it's not secrets it's it's just like we

all graduated from the same school

mm-hmm like alma mater yeah yeah it's

all right

with it's very out story on the back

backsides it's uh it's just it's it's

that's the thing that kind of blows

angel away is it's like those two people

talking that guy works for how solve our

oh that guy works for the fulcrum like

what are they doing talking to each

other no no they went to the same school

and they well within within to a certain

limit they will just exchange

information freely stuff that angel be

like why are you talking about works for

the enemy but yeah they don't want to be

it would be considered rude that's

something the angel is spending a lot of

his time we rapping is that around is

the culture of Rioja not just literally

where the names everything but how what

do people expect and a lot of it

surprises but does that not mean that

you could you could take advantage of

that well it depends I wonder if angel

kind of had this inkling that the

information that they were relating to

one another either was so well known

that it didn't matter that they're

talking about it it was just kind of

exchange of formalities yeah or if they

were actually actively feeding

disinformation to each other to kind of

like you have to share something but

like who says it has to be true angel

doesn't think they would share this

information like it's this that's what

they call the old clay and like anytime

anytime you wonder like why did that guy

get this job when the person who decided

who gets the job is an enemy officer oh

it's the old school ring Nebadon yeah

they're taking care of each other we're

all taking care of each other

right and from angels point of view that

doesn't make any sense they don't feed

each other didn't this information they

often tell each other the truth they

tell each other stuff that like I don't

like and that's true a lot of stuff

there's all these layers in the city and

it's hard for him to kind of figure out

why why don't they just go to war why do

that why does that per their enemies why

don't they do something about it

so that him slim would wonder yes so

that's him trying to just explain his

his own confusion and the stuff that

struck him weird weird when I see each

other they noticed the ring on the hand

no there's no no they often like they

remember each other which the same

school but he's thinking their value to

that just knows each other quite ring

play one of these rings I don't have to

pass y'all all right well not need me

necessarily wear it maybe boots could

wear it right possibly right I mean how

do we get all we could just kill what

just chop that finger off right inside

the ring you can feed him to the ship

yes to the ship - Ian spits other rinks

humans I know I should offer to think

those bodies away yeah well what were

you doing there

you look those Knowles come take all the

bodies get a pet this trip the ship body

better

that would have been it's like living on

cheetah cheese it's it's not it's not

it's not no it doesn't it's not for me

yeah that's nice but yeah I know I'm

gonna get anywhere yeah there's no it

needs any like I said the ship needs

tile on the size of life dolphins and

whales people ain't enough so otherwise

the evening passes uneventful hmm you

are you do sort of start to see the city

and the people in a little bit

differently after angels report like

when you see these guys these various

diplomats and military commanders meet

each other they're like oh yeah

that guys wearing the uniform of how

solve our and that guy works for the

broadsheets why are they talking to each

other mm-hmm anyway it's the next one

evening you guys go back to your rooms

so you the evening passes uneventful II

no shadows are generated the business in

the footstool is light but it's not

nothing it has not been dealt to zero

that's good

and the next morning is your appointment

with the curator let's go see you do it

so that this is the first time you guys

are gonna be heading into the city

proper all right well I mean you could

just not take you up yeah I'm gonna show

up in the fancy duds your fancy toes

haven't arrived yet

right I've still got nothing I'm just

still covered in blood mist and I send

the boy out again I'm gonna use my

prestidigitation to clean the blood off

the sleaze body servants at the ho

are are just they're adults now okay and

yeah they're old men oh and they're

still probably still younger than you

because humans and they can they can go

get you they can if you if you give them

that they're they're designed to be like

your personal concierge they will take

care of stuff in the city if you need to

taken care of if you need clothes they

can get your clothes it will not be this

nicely tailored stuff but it won't

necessarily be a blood-covered right I

just miss other need that seems like

it'd be good to bring a big crew people

wants to talk to the curator Chicago

okay more exploiting sort of live if

leech is not like if leech is like you

have something to talk to the curator

about what saying do you have something

to talk to the curator about I'm

interested in items you might have okay

but do you have anything like do you

like your own personal and it'd be nice

if he had one of these cuz if not I

think what Lars is saying maybe we don't

bring everybody with this whole troupe

of Mercy is not a place I could stay I

don't need well you want to talk about

magic arrows like we we talked do you

want freedom I mean you know you're free

up you can come on

no they're just I think what Lars is

saying is I think you want something mmm

okay yeah no all right I could always

just tell you you go in and find them

too but well you got to learn about your

magic arrows yeah

so alright we go to the curator all

right so this means uh there are a

couple ways to do it you can take a fair

rate you can take a bridge bridge takes

a lot longer if ferry costs a little bit

of money but it's not something that you

folks would need to worry about and

there are nice ferries and there are

cheap fairies and but all of them all

have card stations in front of them that

are that the Marines they're not the

gold buttons the house Perona guys know

the house of the Raven we can take it up

if you want pay for you can yep yeah I

just kind of want to take a tap it's

time to cop it okay oh yeah yeah

it's ten it's ten gold and they don't

have there's like one gold button at

each of the each of the tapestry kiosks

how many's one hold I think they have

like up to three in one one thing the

driver probably there's no driver but

they won't let you on one unless you

don't have any like the Marines can

actually disarm you these guys there's

just one cop here they're just not gonna

let you ride one of these tapestries if

you have any weapons I've left all my

weapons even in the room I mean yeah I'm

in fancy clothes and I'm I've told the

old man to the Caltrain okay I'll be in

fancy or a nice clothes

you're talking mild Chuck no not unless

not well I mean yeah you guys they

probably are because you guys look like

a bunch of soldiers right so the cop is

just gonna say like okay like turn

around and but you watch that they don't

Pat most people now because most people

look like they're dressed in civilian

clothing they're not wearing a

breastplate right you guys look like

even though you're dressed nicely some

of you look like soldiers and they don't

know you like you're not returned repeat

customers right so it's gonna be ten

twenty thirty forty fifty six not

perfect habits per person correct 60

gold okay which is a lot of money is a

lot of money in a medieval cities

economy that's several walk copper for

you guys but a lot of money for as much

Chico the fridge it's 10 gold eh oh yeah

I'll meet you guys there we sit 60 are

you not going on the tapestry I am going

on walks what was on each I mean I got

the card so wait is anyone not taking a

tapestry I am now the rule tagging it

yeah I mean okay so we all do it would

you care to ride together very well just

look at it treasure here is it coming

out of our come out of our gold okay so

you folks pay your money and you are

given a point and those of you who are

human can sense the magic other way hmm

and

there is two people in Ronnie oh and

they take two different tapestries and

going and then you wait and then one by

one tapestries they have no there's no

driver or anything like that but the

coin when yet when you pay your gold

they ask you where you're going so yeah

what station why are you going and you

tell them the district that the address

is in and that's what determines the

coin they give you right so it's the

coin that determines where you're going

and the tapestry just goes where the

coin is it's like a fluorine and he's

got a bag of them and when you say we're

going here it reaches in the bag and he

pulls out okay Mike is gonna take us to

the district or write to the address

it's gonna take you to it's not gonna go

right to the address it's gonna take you

to a kiosk like this it's more like a

Griffin and yeah and the first point is

a two-person

it's a two-person tapestry come on judge

all right well I think you three have to

go together cuz you don't need one on

your own if you with big cat I count us

three probably thinks I yeah big cats

come flying is three to two it's a

two-person town there'll be another one

in a minute sure

suspect it's his emotional support

displacer beast mm-hmm I could just see

this little carpet with this big guy for

this place are beastly

cats not the weirdest thing that's flown

on the carpet I don't know all right so

who's first me judge like grab judge by

the shoulder and like hop on the carpet

so you've watched other people do this

and they don't they don't stand they sit

dad sits down then and one sure both

seated the carpet basically waits it's a

huge it's probably about a two-person

carpet spawn I think is this table right

so like four by six a comfortable

sitting and it is really finely woven it

feels like a very expensive

and it has art on it that you recognize

this has this is the art style of alloy

it's this very kind of abstract

modernistic patterns across it and it

looks as though there's gold and silver

in the threads and once you're both

sitting the tapestry takes off and it's

even though when it's on the ground yeah

it like it's cloth right you could pick

up the corner and flip the corner up as

soon as it lifts off it becomes totally

rigid like it's a flat board of the you

are resting on hmm and it would be weird

for you guys because you're used to cars

and seatbelts and stuff but it takes off

and it flies on a kind of predetermined

path up over the city the wind the wind

blows very strongly past earth base it's

probably one of the fastest ways to get

around anywhere in orden right it's

faster than a horse at a gallop and

there is a definite like stomach

dropping out of your of the pit of you

gut feeling do you do choke over the

side no but it's a it is a closed pod

thing it is an intense field boots

behind you kind of getting queasy but

the carpet like as you as you lean and

like do you look over the sides yeah

yeah yeah yeah fearless okay do you have

do you think George has vertigo I don't

think so fear of heights sense of no no

Josh there's nothing the carpet will

adjust itself so that like as you move

your body and that weight changes the

carpet kind of does this to keep you on

the carpet hmm so so if I lean real hard

is like and I like barrel roll it tries

to it will slide but the car but you

can't seem to make the carpet like do a

loop-de-loop unless you want to try to

throw yourself off

the wind blows pastor here and you are

able to see the entire city spread out

before you it's quite a remarkable view

it's like being a bird is it kinda

liking the realization what what angel

meant about this city is yeah it's huge

its massive it's it's it's bigger than

Ali it's the biggest city that any of

you have ever been to like just this is

the first time you get a really good

look at the stays which is when you're

in it it feels like it is a huge city on

its own but now that you're up above and

you realize oh it's this tiny sliver of

land compared to this massive built-up

floodplain that is capital and capital

is built in rings and you can see rivers

and tributaries running through places

as you can see as you get further into

the coast

it feels built up like this the

buildings get larger and larger and

larger until eventually you can see huge

spires like churches and what's probably

the University of these massive this

massive complex of buildings they're all

quite tall and there are Hills the city

rises as you get further inland and you

guys are going to the Blues you're going

to Blue Hill which is kind of one of the

more expensive parts of the city and you

fly over the Coliseum which is this kind

of ruined Caelian Empire artifact where

they used to have gladiator combats and

the Circus Maximus now it's all grey

it's in disuse and there are other

carpets flying by it's like being a

spinner and Blade Runner like you

because we've you can see other people

on carpets going one direction or

another it's like there's a whole like

network of pathways up here in the sky

that each carpet is blindly

automatically following and after about

20 minutes on this carpet it starts to

auger in oh it starts to land and

there's another one of these like

food-truck sized kiosks with a guard

this is a different completely different

guards got a black outfit gold trim and

there's member of the farriers guild

there to take your coins

Wow and that is the process of getting

snatches and outputs it puts it in his

and their other carpets leaving so he's

taking and depending on where people

going he's collecting these these magic

coins the teller carpets were to go and

it took them about 20 minutes and if

we've gone in the other way a couple of

like at least a day

whoa-ohh that's all yeah but not because

of how long it takes to walk like angel

said like it's just like okay like you

can see as you fly over the city you can

see the actions and what they controls

because they build walls and gates and

there's always everything every yeah

every gate you fly over there's a huge

crowd of people standing outside I

didn't get through yeah we basically

paid for just like convenience fee or

something yeah even if you're on foot

you can take a coach and you can get to

a gate if you're a VIP as angel put it

which is basically at night then you can

get through the gates without having a

way no but he's like we aren't that yeah

right I'm just pay a lot of money though

to Titan ISM yeah and you get so after

having gotten this bird's-eye view of

this massive city you zoom in and this

is the you're actually in the theater

district so there are lots of huge

buildings they almost look like they

look like half Cathedral right they've

got huge beautiful windows and a lot of

gold fixtures on the walls some of its

kind of chintzy like they've spent a lot

of money to make it look more make these

theaters look more regal than they might

actually be and it's early morning

problem at and I would say nine o'clock

businesses now active there's people all

over the streets and the people on the

streets here are way less Paris there's

way more Rio ins you can still see it

every once in a while a dwarf or an elf

but there's no like stone giants walking

around the Rio ins are a pretty

multicultural society themselves so

being a Rio and you could look like

you're from tomorrow or course Aryan or

a vana Gorian but they're all in Rio and

garb and Rio and dress and they all seem

a lot more well-off than the folks you

are used to seeing in the States and

it's according to the address the lawyer

the dead lawyer gave you it's

about a 15-minute walk north to the

address let's walk let's go I've got my

my finger off yeah and I get a coin that

you know that would be cool no good time

this is the this is a signet ring that

somebody sent us all right well I think

I'm enjoyed that yeah it probably

reminded him of sailing gift Yankee

skips through the astral seat I mean

yeah it's uh it's it's the astral sea is

a lot it doesn't have it's not like

human seas with waves and stuff I

parents a lot smoother and a lot more

like yeah like being on tapestry the

wind in your hair mm-hmm Odie in

commandeering like having a fleet of

these carpets and descending on you're

dropping bombs on your enemy the stuff

Zak yeah that's good let's get a lot of

like Molotov cocktails and just how much

for copy right give a sparrow not for

sale no amount of gold good luck

next it's not about buying the carpet

it's about controlling the resource yeah

angel angel angels report like one dude

owns all these carpets yeah what if he

just sold you like to charge you a lot

of money because then he'd have to run

because he would you would come after

him well so yeah the the address that

you were given leads to what looks like

like a like a New York brownstone all

right it's a brick it's a brick building

it's old it has a really nice kind of

upper middle class lower upper class

windows like stained-glass windows small

discreet and it's got stairs walking up

and it's got a pair of double doors and

there's no

like sign over it or anything it looks

like a likes a well-off person lives

here doorbell no you can see inside that

there was a bell on the inside of the

door open the door I knock on the door I

just opened it and just walked in mm-hmm

strode in comfort there's a small for

yay that is it's about like half the

size of this room and there's a heavy

wooden door opposite the bell rings and

there's like a couple of small seats in

here and some little discrete bookcase

and baz with some flowers in it but

other than that there's nothing in this

this antechamber does anybody like our

yoo-hoo Slim has gone in one of the rest

you do it

yeah we'll follow them yes once all six

of you are in the 4a and the door closes

you hear a latch on the door when you go

click all right so all right so you open

the door to the curators Club it's been

described as a private club mm-hmm and

it's somewhat disorienting because the

building that you walked into is like a

two-story building right but when you

walk into this place it's it's very tall

it's a relatively small room but it goes

up quite a ways right and there are

ladders leading up there all these

shelves and it is much bigger in here

than it was outside mm-hmm likes like a

pocket universe kind of a yeah tall just

like tartan yeah yeah I mean you don't

know what they're yeah you know I mean

yeah no tea no tea

not OD but OD yeah they're very very

TARDIS like and there are there's a

there's a counter as a door behind the

counter there's a figure behind the

counter who is putting objects into a

box of small box and there's somebody up

on the ladder and the person behind the

counter is about 12 feet tall and

initially it looked like you walked into

like an arboretum because it looks like

a giant tree yeah right but as you as

you stand there like okay so what's like

where's the curator the the branches on

the tree are picking and you realize

that these aren't knots there's a face

and it's like a tree and it's like nice

a net but it's small like if you've seen

it before they're right they're like

huge right this is a relatively small

one and it's like I said it's easy to

mistake it for a tree but it has arms

it's got a face it's got eyes it is a

humanoid it's just a humanoid that has

branches arc instead of skin and it's

got branches and leaves coming off of it

and the tree aunt sees you all walk in

and says oh hey well yeah we heard about

you folks we were expecting you my name

is sue mat pol the figure on the on this

on the ladder there's another tree looks

the same as this one and he climbs down

and he goes my name is also assumed at

Pole and then you hear like a hatch open

and from underneath the what's the one

we confront the counter comes like

there's a downstairs and it comes

climbing of it is another treant looks

exactly the same and he looks at the

other two and he says my name is Joe

sooo Matt poll and then all three of

them say in unison

welcome to the permanent transient how

you folks doing a while yeah we we heard

that like some mercenaries were shown up

but you folks are really not nicely

dressed yeah normally the kind of and

then the other Trina start speaking goes

yeah normally the kind of folks are

coming here if they're like a mercenary

they don't dress super nice no no in

fact I would say like typically they're

I mean no offense but they're like

they're typically pretty filthy yeah

yeah they're super dirty and sometimes

they're covered in blood

yeah yeah they just walk around like

they ain't got no parents like no one

raised him right and they're all but you

guys seem really nice yeah but anyway

anyway what can we do for you folks are

you all of you

the governor's only if there's only one

of us there's only I mean I know there

looks like there's three of us but

there's only one of us technically

technically not really technically

technically that's what that's what he

says yeah no it's true there is there's

no there's three of us but we're three

different vectors on the manifold did

you see their name is sumac pole to Matt

Pole yeah yeah oh okay yeah so we wanted

to see what you guys have on stock and

we have some yeah the dead guy told us

that we should be nice to you and help

you out so what were you're looking for

so we need some fairly mundane things

like a sending stone and a bag of all

the-- sending stone yeah we can probably

get you one of those but what we got uh

but it might take a little while to get

a sending stone I mean it's pretty easy

but it might take a little while the

other one one of the other zoom apples

goes yeah my but we got I think we got

something down we'll show him the pouch

it was oh yeah we got he goes into a

cupboard and pulls out a couple of they

look like leather pouches and he goes

he's kind of work the same you could

have these if you want them otherwise

we'll get you some send in stone I mean

how it works and one of the Summa

follicles yeah so what you do is you

take like a writing implement and

something here right on and you'll make

how you put a message in one of these

and you just stick it in the back and

then whoever has the other bag

they open it up and they get the message

and it's like a sending stone except you

don't hear voices and one goes yeah so

if it needs to be voices if you need to

be able to you know we can get you a

setting stone yeah but if you don't want

to wait yeah you can just have peace I

think that'll be better for it's just

papers letters

is there a distance it'll work across

any manifold well yeah you can be a

novel leather as a manifestation on the

Timescape yeah it just works with paper

correct

it's messages like if you could put a

nice button the other one says well you

could put like a tablet in the rice sub

back yeah yeah I could probably put like

a tablet as long as there was writing in

it and there'd be another tablet in the

other pouch on a billion me like a

duck's bill why would you do that

maybe she doesn't like ducks maybe I

think she means like a bill like a bill

of sale oh yeah yeah like a bill that

makes a lot more sense like a lady to

you I'm sorry I'm sorry we're not used

to stringent II flings in here where we

you know mostly get Homans yeah yeah

plus you all you fall you uh are you

pink skins all look the same except your

skin is a little less pink and then one

of us hey hey are you a gift like yeah I

think he is yeah oh wow yeah we haven't

spent a long time since I get those

coming here hey which kind of gift are

you is all I thought I could guess cuz

there's a couple right there's like the

uh there's the gift that gets there I

guess there is it what was he on there's

a gift duros goes no I think that once I

get kinky oh yeah look at him yeah look

at that big sort yeah he's like it

Yankee hey are you from the yah you're

from the Aspel see yes oh that's cool

yeah hey I think that there's like a sue

mat pole I think there's a permanent

transient on the on the astral Seon like

the big kinky city

oh yeah I think there is one there too

yeah yeah because there's permanent

transients all over the place where

reflected through the manifold all the

time and another one says yeah I heard

that there's one where we're like a

bunch of a bunch of giants oh I'd like

to be a giant that'd be neat yeah yeah

and there's one I heard where we're like

a bunch of coats and the other oh sweet

you say you say toads yeah like there's

a whole magic store - just toads can

like toad toad toad toad men no no like

little tiny toad creatures and it's a

whole world where there's like a talking

animals with like puppies and dogs and

hats and stuff it goes oh that's kind of

that's weird I don't know if I wanted

the Toto to creep me out

and then one goes no but they can't

creep you out cuz they don't I like

toads and we're the same person

no you keep saying that but we're not

the same person no no but we are like it

we're just were just different vectors

and oh sorry

yeah anyway anyway sending stones so we

got you the diplomat pouches those are

fine at weekends we got lots other stuff

and there's a ton of crap in here by the

way there's like you see in this column

going up on these shelves they're boxes

you see weapons armor you notice that

there's like a stuffed lizard like a

six-legged big big six legged lizard and

then it starts kind of like moving it's

not stuff it's alive there's a live

basilisk crawling around mmm in here

well there's a copper like you look over

there's like a box full of what look

like big like lollipop things but if you

look closer there beholder eyestalks

there's just a big thing yeah there's a

there's a like on the floor in front of

you there's a box of metal gears and

plates and stuff like a suit of Mars

would think of as being like Iron Man

armor just in a big pile in a giant box

on the ground oh yeah I don't know if

that works anymore that's just a bunch

of inexorable parts yeah I don't think I

don't we're still trying to figure out

what to do with those we'd browse

oh yeah sure yeah you can look around if

you folks want yeah like I want I just

want to look at the weapons what weapons

they have there they're mostly they look

like Salvage right they're mostly old

and there of all these weird different

ancient cultures hmm but there is almost

if you spend the time to look around

there's almost every kind of weapon you

can think of in here

oh hey you have hey you have some

carries sort you what

oh yeah look he's got the third ray oh

hey Wow well we were wondering where

that was oh hey that's good to know

anyway which one is that oh that's the

sort of music yes one no the uh the

other one we got ship that's like that's

like my mother raised do we know about

yeah I think we do I think there's only

like four more whose sword is that

that's um it's one of the he wasn't he

was uh I don't know like how long ago it

was yeah cuz time time in here it

doesn't work the same as it unlike our

tomorrow and then no one says probably

not gonna be the same tomorrow zero

tomorrow and then the thermos yeah

that's why you don't sell calendars and

the first guys like he was on ancient

night of Kimora he worked for the

Pharaoh and he had he had nine nine

soldiers and they each had aa weapon and

they've been lost for a long time yeah

yeah probably like thousands of years

yeah the other one goes or maybe like

only a few dozen yeah we don't know oh

yeah no yeah they're super nice well you

know what the sword does anything extra

I mean some of them like the one some

car used like the first ray that was I

would say that was like an artifact yeah

oh yeah I probably lots of stuff yeah

have you ever heard of the Jade oh you

mean the Jade hand oh yeah that's one of

the wards of the Emperor yeah yeah uh

Octavia's Maximus yeah the last emperor

yeah that's one of his that's why his

things yeah yeah that guy was great oh

yeah he came in here Octavius did oh

yeah that was a while ago

oh yeah like weeks no no it was like

years ago oh sure yeah what is sorry if

everybody knows this like we can just

skip it but like what is what does that

do where's the jade Han dude oh I don't

know like we never sold oh no we don't

stock no Jade yeah no but uh we could

probably find out for you

okay yeah that'd be great if we could

figure out what it does and also how to

destroy it

oh gosh yeah that's gonna be hard yeah

well they're gonna kill Ajax well yeah

probably like he wouldn't like it if you

blew that thing up Oh AJ what do you

know well we kind of keep track of where

stuff is yeah and something like one of

the wards of the last emperor when it's

when it's not in the when it's not in

ring well anymore like we want to know

about it yeah so right now Ajax has it

but like how long is that guy gonna live

oh yeah like I mean even if he lives for

a long time it's probably only gonna be

like another couple decades yeah yeah so

we like to keep track of that stuff

because sooner or later everything comes

through here where is here where is what

do you mean like this is the this is the

permanent transient transient he's like

it's the place he goes don't get

confused because it's bigger on the

inside this is just a sub additive

matrix and it's not that it's not it's

not normalized hey nice cat oh thank you

oh yeah so uh we have to find a very

powerful wizard okay do you have any

means of magic protection well like what

do you mean we gotta like all sorts of

armor and we got scrolls and stuff

that'll help you out and give you a

resistance to things what about that I'm

looking for

what about there's an incense burning

here by the way did I mention that man

this is a really strong really strong

incense in here what about a means to

infuse a shield or armor with magic

resistance oh you mean like an influx

yeah we could probably handle one of

those four-way did you say magic

resistance yeah well now what do you

mean like magic resistance you mean like

somebody casts a spell at you and it's

gonna be less effective like if it were

a fireball maybe like they'd be

resistant to fire do you mean like

spells just bounce off you and they

don't affect you at all because like the

first one yeah the first one is easy to

do yeah something like bio resistance

that's super easy but if you want like

not not reflective it's a can they sense

what Slim has I don't know well you

could you could you could express how

would how would how would

how would case let's press that slim is

very effective at Osher della flying and

dodging spells yeah sure but there was

our trade-off right it's cuz of the way

he cuz he's raised on the astral seat

and it's part of the whole gift the he

wouldn't say like genome he would come

up with some other term for but it's

also there's our trade off there right

so like psychic abilities and stuff like

psionics oh yeah special talents they

just chew through that guy oh yeah yeah

so I mean yeah that's like oh oh but

that's what you want right yeah I get to

which one no one goes hey like a brass

man oh yeah yeah so what you want is you

want like a brass man it's a good

example because they are like and they

point at the box of inexorable oh yeah

they're like constructs and you get one

of those as our guard and they're like a

like lightning rods for magic you get

one of those guys as a bodyguard and

magic just roots into him and people

cast on spells at you

the brass guard takes it and it grounds

it yeah yeah those are super good hey do

we have any of those do we have a brass

man in the moon's like no I don't think

we do

no just out of curiosity yeah do you

have any great swords of the vorpal

variety oh you mean like a the kind that

like Oh snicker-snack and chop off

people's heads and stuff uh oh we

probably get you one of those like but

if we did like what would you be doing

with your life scaler there I'd probably

trade it oh yeah okay yeah because we

could probably make a do something I

mean what like one of those kind of oh

yeah like the dead guy said we should be

nice to you so you don't have to treat

it if you don't want to but gosh it

looks nice

[Laughter]

you folks it has the longer you're in

this room are kind of more like well I'm

just trying to think of what's the most

ridiculous thing I do you have razor got

black razor yeah oh I don't even know

his black razor in this manifold I don't

I don't know I haven't heard of it no I

think that's in one of the other I think

that's what are they what are these guys

call it like another world yeah yeah

yeah yeah I might be in like a world

below or an alternate an alternate

alternate prime material point yeah yeah

but I think we would know if black razor

were in this and they look at this tray

that's on the counter and it looks like

a die rolling tray around

and it's got this it's nicely

custom-made a nice wood he's got a rim

going around it but the actual tray

itself is just flat sand and the sand is

like dancing ever so slightly and

they're like I think and they look at

that thing I think we would know if like

black razor showed up in this manifold

hmm well that's another ridiculous thing

well we can probably get you off four

per weapon we'll have to well let the

will let that dead guy know when it

shows up at won't take that long and

then will you cope you come back or

maybe I'll bring it to you yeah how's

this working is it like the Dead Guy

just buying us so we got we got to buy a

tab within some unknown range because we

did we'd it's already good for him right

I thought so it's a yeah I don't know

what a more large doesn't know what a

horrible what and does so it's [ __ ]

bad-ass it's like plus three [ __ ]

chops heads off mmm yeah even our last

game I don't think so

you drinking at that [ __ ] hole or

adders a set on the hand take care yeah

we're not really a store in the sense

that we're like a private club and you

guys aren't members so like you can't

just have whatever you want and if and

it's sort of like it's up to the our

relationship with a dead guy he's one of

our clients and so he kind of gave us

some guidelines but other than that like

we're just here to help you out but a

vorpal blade is within oh yeah sure that

ya know whether it's whether it like the

weather you get what your what weather

sneeringly

that's what Phil's expecting huh that I

don't know right you'll definitely get

something that counts as a vorpal blade

like interesting the headshot that's why

they said you mean like the head

shopping thing like now they can get you

one of those huh I do I'm looking for a

sword oh thank you

yeah actually well we'll get to that in

a minute but I've been using these uh

well this mundane old thing for a long

time but I'll show what are you showing

us this my rapier

oh yeah um yeah that's not magic is it

no oh yeah yeah we can help you out

there yeah sure yeah you just want to

mention grape here we got one of them

yeah what do you got no sure and they

have the guy goes up this tree very

slowly climbs up and out goes thank you

he just grabs a Rio and fencing sword

and comes no it's not actually a rapier

it is like a pay but it'll do rate

bureaus damage and it's just a plus one

sort it comes back down he goes is this

the kind of thing you're looking for cuz

this is no problem

mm perhaps what do you got in a line of

like Footwear I mean we can probably I

don't know if we got any boots or

anything around your nothing that looks

as nice as that but we might be able to

get you some some of the bouncy boots

what do they call those things oh they

were jumping oh yeah the jump boots yeah

I don't know what they're called but we

can probably get yeah yeah yeah I mean

they can probably procure the thing is

like they can go away and do some

research and search through their

inventory and maybe find something but

there's no guarantee what it's gonna be

but you can plug it some magic boots

okay yeah some instant magic boots what

else you folks want like what's the

goblin watt we talked to you or do we

talk to the cat the cat okay hey kitty

what you want she wants some arrows

Divini yeah any magical you speak for

the cat yeah yeah oh yeah she wants some

air of some magic girls oh we got some

magic arrow didn't we just get some

magic arrows in here we go yeah we got

the five the arrows of yeah there was a

pillar if the archer oh you only have

those things yeah but we'll win for

those for a long time but we don't know

anyone who's a none of our clients use

up oh no in fact most of them don't use

weapons so and these goes and gets a box

and it's like god it's like somebody

took five arrows and just tossed him in

a wooden box and pushes him out on the

counter and he's like I think we can

just give these to you yeah probably

yeah what they do

oh we don't know exactly what each one

does something different like

it was a famous Archer mm yeah elf elf

Archer guy oh yeah yeah oh yeah elf elf

elf Archer yeah yeah you gonna show him

yeah and he takes them out and one of

them has its there there are five you

know otherwise mundane arrows but the

humans could tell you they're magic one

of them has a sulphur head one of them

as a quartz head one of them has a brass

and one of them as a stone head and one

of them has it looks like a cotton ball

at the enemy okay yeah we're not sure

what those do yeah no we were gonna get

them go take them to a wizard get them

identified yeah but okay we could maybe

do that maybe sure yeah maybe just try

shooting them see what happens yeah but

not in here no not in here no no one

there's all sorts of words in here they

might not even work yeah anyway do you

have something called star metal

oh you want some star metal yeah uh yeah

but what for you want some Star Medal uh

we can probably get you any elf metal

that's easy

yeah I think we got some sin metal here

do we oh yeah I don't you're weak I know

shipment a while ago oh yeah we haven't

figured out it's gonna buy it though huh

what is that I don't that is oh it's uh

dwarf no the what's the what's the under

what's the dwarfs down there bad dwarfs

the barrels yeah that's it that door car

is it Dwyer I thought it was dog are was

door to her car yeah it's kind of DNA

you like do then it goes to her guard

and the third one's like no I think it's

block all right man I think that you is

like a W oh we had that make sense

dude war yeah yeah it's not to our door

metal and it makes it cuz I drag our it

can't tells you to shut up

they spend all their time underground

right and so when they come out above

they come out here into the into this

manifold the Sun kind of freaks them out

because they don't know they don't got

no Sun down there yeah

so they get real sensitive around the

Sun and it kind of blinds them and it

makes the Salinas all the time and so

they got this metal they mined down

there they call it the sin metal and

they can make all like armor out of it

and stuff like that and while they're

wearing it then they could walk around

in the daylight

yeah we got we don't got no armor but we

got some we got some or we got some of

the or yeah yeah one of the yeah more

clients brought it in I got two more

questions for you yeah so the garden

right yeah yeah were you born there or

you were from Rioja no I was born there

okay so there is a missing sword of my

st. that's been gone

oh yeah the saint a saint out of missing

so yeah that's the called us sort of a

thousand years yeah yeah a kimete soo

yeah we can see by your holy symbol do

you have any idea where that is

oh yeah well I mean it depends on your

point of view like well we can't we

couldn't give you a vector on it we

can't specifically locate it but it's

probably a ring well yeah I think it's

one of the wards of the last emperor and

where's ring well oh yeah that's a good

question right oh you don't know we

don't know nobody know ya know ya know a

lot of people think it's it must be here

in the city yeah cuz this was this was

the this was the Emperor city for like a

thousand years yeah but that's stupid

can't be in the city because he wouldn't

put it here yeah but it might be it

might be in the city it might be yeah

people think of some people think it is

but that don't make no sense it's

probably another it's probably another

sub additive matrix it's probably like a

like not not in this manifold yeah will

the blade of a thousand years the blade

of say naka meets ooh you called it the

last sort I mean it's somebody knows

where it is it's just vodka beats who

don't know so then the other question is

so we like you a lot oh thanks yeah hey

and we're gonna be nice yeah we talked

to a lots of mercenaries they coming

here all the time and usually they're uh

they're not very nice no we like people

who are clean and nice haircuts and or a

nice clothes well we're gonna we're

gonna be finding interesting things like

a third gray and that life-stealing

sword yeah sure I could potentially

trade you so how could we go about

getting membership all of us we don't

the thing is we already we're sort of

already follow up yeah yeah yeah I

didn't plus well you know running the

shop is kind of a dangerous business so

we're not really looking for more

clients right now but if that changes

yeah we'll let you know yeah you

mentioned

some Allah that can protect me from

sunlight oh yeah cuz you're a drought

yeah you're like the same thing as the

as the do-rag are mmm yeah it's not it's

made of this we don't got none of that

we have the metal though yeah we over

the [ __ ] yeah we could get you the

[ __ ]

get him get on the or yeah I don't think

it's gonna ask for it okay yeah and they

goes downstairs and they came to talking

to you and ask you like you guys been to

the astral sea and stuff and then come

back up he's got a huge big like a giant

platter with handles on it and sitting

on it is this massive chunk of

semi-transparent metal that has this as

the light goes through it it reflect

refract refracts the light into like

little coral reef in and it like purple

rays he's like so you gotta go find out

blacksmith but probably like I need you

get a blacksmith and you get all wizard

or like a priest could probably yeah

like a priest or a wizard and blacksmith

and probably like they don't have to

it's not that big a deal

you got the metal they then you make the

armor and it'll come out

send metal armor and then you can keep

it where this stuff it's gonna be pretty

heavy yeah yeah like that guy he looks

like a magic user yeah you're probably

like a sorcerer or something yeah

drought sorcerer yeah yeah I don't know

if you're gonna want to walk around and

much have you Harbor but depends on the

blacksmith you take it - hey where'd

this bug come from scan where plate man

hey speaking of armor do depends on the

blacksmith right that's the funny big

something to make you give anything away

Jania more armor with any special

properties oh I don't know like what

kind of properties you're talking about

you're gonna have to like it they're not

they don't like a catalog oh you have to

be more specific in what you ask for

and if they don't if they don't have

anything they could probably catch you

something but there's a the limit is

basically like one thing per person oh

they're giving you if they're getting

your boots like the arrows count is one

thing my guy if they're getting your

boots if they're giving you this this

thing like like slim could be like no I

don't want anything and then maybe you

get two things I didn't actually ask

someone what I wanted ask do you want to

ask him

that one when it discrete I want to be

discreet Oh slim wants to be discreet

how is he going to do that well you

probably take one of them aside and ask

them about what he was looking for yeah

yeah what's your yeah what doe yeah you

want to talk about something what okay

so just so you know just a nice little e

like slim we're talking they're still

talking wouldn't he wouldn't want to

admit weakness weakness right so so I

don't think he would say in front of

these guys basically you know yeah you

want something special yeah yeah you

want something that would strengthen his

mind oh yeah like it's like the other

the other guy said like because your

suit like mitts magic don't work on you

that well but like other people's brain

stuff that's right so you don't want the

brain stall that I mean I was thinking

like I mean I don't know how slim would

say this but something to boost his

wisdom so that is also like it was more

like yeah like um like a was it to

enlightenment it would be like you want

area like wisdom nor home oven light

yeah so something like that probably

pretty easy to come by if that's all you

don't want like we could probably get

you a there's a bunch of different tomes

like yeah the circle it I think was it

the circle intervene intellect that

that's actually intelligent but do they

have a wisdom version of that well that

would be like a parry opt but they'll be

able to get you a bump to your wisdom

huh su mente says yeah I got we can get

you like a permanent some kind of item

that'll that'll increase your like how

would you put you to say like it'll

enhance your enlightenment yeah it'll

bring enlightenment yeah you need to be

more enlightening yeah so we can help

you with that that's no problem yeah I

was afraid you were gonna ask for

something crazy like one of those one of

those amulets that means no one can find

you and makes it so people can't know

what's inside your brain yeah that would

be hard to do and not impossible know

there's such a thing oh yeah yeah

they're super popular yeah everyone who

comes in here wants for them but there

just ain't that many of them yeah yeah

yeah there's a ring too there's a ring

that makes it so no one can know what

you're thinking yeah people love that

people love that ring so that's one of

the reason we don't get in on them like

yeah all the noblemen well like all our

clients are like what we need to ring a

we need to handle

we have one of those ambulance

perception proof against detection in

location no I think she's talking about

bringing mind shielding no he's kind of

described both of those things now yeah

yeah so yeah we can get you like we'll

have the dead guy bring you something

it's going to take a little bit of time

there's all we got a lot of stuff here

but I know I've seen one of those little

things you wear it's got some incense in

it

and while the incense is burning it

brings your enlightenment not like that

incense that one sense does green light

that wouldn't be permanent thing that's

like only as long as the the wisdom

burns long as the inferences oh it's

magic the incense never burns out mm-hmm

that's appearing after by the way uh I

say this likes of me pin on your shirt

mm-hmm yeah it's kind of like a iron

stone or something actually you would

say we could Poli got you on Ione stone

that's another way there's uh there's

lots of them and we got a couple of them

here it might take me a while to find

one but I know that one of them brings

enlightenment a lot of that makes us

smarter one of the Minx of people like

you better yeah and some of them you can

put spells in them and stuff yeah

they're crazy one of them makes people

like you better actually don't you guys

have a highness don't oh yeah we do have

the reception who's wearing it I am you

want to just walk her over there like

Elrond with a bug

okay I'll trade him for the wisdom one

though well you don't know that Phil's

asking for the wisdom hmm oh yeah slim

slim would never admit when he feels

vulnerable in that area so yeah he he

gives copper the fire arrows do I know

um can you I won't ask again what they

their work does work I'll tell you what

they are cuz I know you'd like judge has

identified yeah so you're not gonna find

this out in the shop yeah but before you

need to use them the one with a sulfur

head is called burn when you fire to

somebody if you hit them they eat a

fireball mm-hmm well like a fireball

goes so you got to be careful you should

that it does not distinguish my job

yeah the one with the quartz head deploy

is a wall of ice the one with the stone

head is called excavate and it will

destroy a 10-foot section on stone right

but won't the brass head is called

translator if you shoot somebody if you

shoot something with it

it will teleport you to where the two

arrow lands well but only you but all

right not not be kept after the breaths

never gonna use that one again no and

the one with the cotton it's not cotton

it's actually like a rolled-up spiderweb

and you shoot that at something and

whatever it hits it webs it will

entangle a whole area noise it's like a

thief so Phil Phil what did you ask you

what do you actually want do you want

that do you want the wisdom thing or do

you want the vorpal blade well I mean

that's that's tough I didn't I didn't

think you'd I didn't think that would be

even a possibility for complaints of

magic well you're not gonna your he's

that what they're gonna do is they're

all gonna get you like a plus one vorpal

blade you're all in 19 or 20 you're

gonna chop off a limb all right right

and that's the it's got the properties

of a vorpal weapon but it's not

necessarily a legendary item that you

that phil rivers right right right

gotcha

no I think what I think it in character

yeah

slim would want would want like that

like a like a ton of tomans I know a

book that you read that that boost you

yeah they're like when you say when you

say because you know obviously you're a

six level gift interdimensional battle

master you are aware of the presence of

some of these items you've heard about

them so when you ask about the tome zoom

Apple is like oh you owe me not codex do

you and then yes it would you all

thought we don't we like if we had one

of those we couldn't give it to you but

you don't mean to codex you just meet at

home okay if you like they're the super

overreacts when he's like you I mean a

codex to you when you're talking about

book but he can get you engage a tome

enlightenment excellent how much does

that give you tier 2 gives you two yeah

it'll raise it effectively by 101 I

thought was - no it's - it's two points

which changes your bonus by one all

right yeah forget this

this metal yeah is it yeah you can just

have it yeah but would if I get it made

into armor yeah is it is that it I can

just walk around in sunlight I got any

other a benefit oh I don't know buddy

you'd never wait we're not Smiths we've

never really worked with the metal I

think you might be able to do some kind

of spell storing with it yeah I think I

might have some boring like somebody

casts a spell at you

I think that's if you make all weapon oh

yeah oh yeah you're right yeah so it's

the armor that makes it so you can walk

around in the daylight which I mean

that's if you are uh if you're on door

that wants to fight in the daylight

that's super useful but also I think you

can make a weapon out of it the weapon

will store a spell so yeah somebody cast

the spell out sure it goes into the into

the sword I think yeah you would have to

ask a blacksmith on a wizard mm-hmm

would you have anything to make my

current magic more powerful Oh like what

you're talking about like if I was to

use an agonizing blast to make you more

powerful oh yeah you're a warlock ya

know that bank that we don't know like

that's up to your patron that's up to

whatever like a Noli pact you made with

some crazy demon thing does I have to be

a demon thing man it can be like an old

elf oh yeah I made a very holy pact

oh yeah that's fantastic yet no we don't

we're we're neutral and no matter we

don't care which side you work for but

that's up between you and your power

yeah they gotta just like you a whole

lot and then maybe something nice

happens yeah I'll take the metal in okay

sure I'm very grateful for it do we have

anything else to lock my want I don't

know could I put the metal on big cat I

fear I wouldn't be able to carry it

alone so oh D and get some similarly if

you pay for the next step five minutes

so Odin's gonna get some sin metal and

we'll figure out how you're gonna get a

turn deny their weapon or armor what

kind of weapon you might be able to take

like uh yeah we might build or something

out where you could wear some armor

whatever you gonna like to turn it in

China I like a Helen or some sort of

metal or anything

yeah protection did you put its in metal

lets inm et al sitting I mean because is

the is it because that's not what you

were asking about you were asking about

da stuff yeah oh the red stuff is blood

metal that's different yeah blood metals

the mage the mage color yeah you have

that one is a sensitivity like skin or

is it like eyes like it blind you

oh no it's like radiation yeah it looks

um you like cooks them cuz they don't

got no son winner from something like

that I could just cover up yeah sure

right yeah but if you're gonna imagine

like you're off your ah do or gar dog

are or whatever and you're trying to go

to war like you can't just you can't

fight if you're covered up in like you

know SPF 10000 or whatever do I have

enough melt to make Omer Anna wit

probably one more I don't know any other

yeah yeah it strange reading it's it's

strange like we get we've got a shipment

of exactly enough to make one or the

other but not both

yeah us we don't know how much that

might be no like I said we're not

blacksmiths no I'll take the metal thank

you yeah we come to Dennis bringing us

we're glad you can just you can just

leave with some of the stuff iris oh

yeah what did you want oh yeah

so just gonna bring out this one brush

oh hey nice work and show it but it's

not magical

no yeah so that's a problem okay yeah

sure well we can't really fix that like

light like we said it we're not

blacksmiths button what I'm wondering is

if you have something in a similar style

that maybe has a mind of its own

anything oh pension towards demons

you mean like it when you say pension

you mean like I like some more wants to

kill him he wants to oh so now you're

talking about like when you say it has a

mind of its own do you mean like a

singing sword or a dancing sword where

you can just kind of leave it alone and

it'll attack things on its own and you

can go do something else or do you mean

like you can talk to it and it's kind of

personality and it sometimes sometimes

it might want to do something and you

got a depending on how you're feeling

you might you might have to do what it

tells you all right oh yeah ok so like

swords with you go yeah so like an ego

sword we don't got

them that we use to stock eagle soars

but they're kind of a pain in the butt

yeah cuz they like want to run the show

yeah they're super bossy they want to

take over you can't even pick them up

sometimes otherwise you get that voice

in your head and all of a sudden we're

fighting with each other which is tough

because we're like the same person yeah

like what happens if one of us dies I

don't know I think we all die you know

because I'm telling you it doesn't work

that way

we're not three were three different

people now or not we're not the same

vector anymore oh yeah you keep saying

that but I don't think no no no we used

to stock those but you could probably

make something that was like I didn't

like demons if you want to make a sword

that was like a demon slaying sword

that's pretty easy actually all you'd

have to do is have like the heart of a

demon yeah yeah we got one of those oh

yeah yeah that's right here it was

shrunk then there's this like smoking

piece of red charcoal that almost glows

from within and goes yeah it's the heart

of the demons as is it SAS

no not SAS zaz Oh Oh when you say that

is there like a because they're like one

of those apostrophes in there yeah yeah

there's an apostrophe between the two

A's okay so it was like za apostrophe AZ

yeah SADS

yeah so you give that to our blacksmith

like anybody that could make armor on it

out of that or could probably make you a

demon slang weapon if they if you use

the heart of this demon yeah would that

make it a magical weapon oh yeah it

would definitely be a magical weapon

yeah I don't know if it would be I don't

know if it would be any good of hitting

things

oh yeah probably would yeah yeah it

wouldn't just be magic it would probably

be like you know a keen edge hit things

real well yeah probably yeah yeah it's

up to the blacksmith and it's up to the

wizard you get depends on how smart they

are but if they can use this and yeah

you get a demon slaying weapon yeah yeah

and one of those out who knows maybe you

would have maybe whatever and you go oh

yeah sure yeah I might have though ye

right it's it's adds his heart maybe it

would have his voice yeah oh wow yeah

I'm glad I'm not gonna have that yeah

sure

I don't want a demon's voice in the

sword no I mean either no that would be

weird

but that's a possibility I mean we don't

know we don't mix words we'll just give

you the heart yeah we just do hearts

yeah and or yeah sooo Matt mr. Paul oh

yeah guy with the boots that's right

look II guess who do you know this seems

like a fine weapon but would you have

anything you actually I just realized

that like we don't have our swords with

us no it's pointy and it's alright yeah

sorry uh might you have anything uh I

heard of a weapon wants a scimitar of

speed uh okay so but does it have to be

a scimitar though not necessarily

something that did similar well we could

probably fight like so yeah no we don't

I don't think we have us a weapon of

speed but we might be able to get you

the ingredients yeah yeah you're talking

about some of that elvish mercury yeah

some of that elvish marker you probably

do it it's blue blue mercury that would

make it a weapon to speak yeah do we

have any blue mercury yeah why are you

asking him oh I saw I was a rhetorical

question yeah I don't think I don't

think we have any any blue mercury but

we could probably get some well let the

dead guy know hey the good news is

though I probably only take a couple of

days yeah for them only a couple yeah

for you oh we don't know how long it

take for us yeah fantastic

do you have a any particular blacksmiths

and wizards you'd recommend for these

jobs well our clients usually have their

own I would ask the dead guy okay yeah

does it be easiest obviously if we get

everything delivered don't you guys have

a blacksmith you gotta cut this nice

armor and you guys are mercenaries my

guys actually a well he's proficient in

Smith's tools yeah so Smith was probably

like and you're the weapon master

between the two you guys you might be

able to be able to be your own

blacksmith no nerd right crap I forgot

butts isn't what's an actual enchanter I

think so

yeah cuz she's always tinkering with

stuff and experimenting so you had like

the only other thing the only thing

you're missing

is you don't have an actual blacksmith

retainer because that's part of the

straw holes and followers thing but I

think based on Slim's background he

could he could act as the blacksmith

right my reasonable to expect that when

he was a slave to the or even before it

was a slave you might have been you know

we had hundreds of years to learn the

random [ __ ] that's true that's that's

the thing about the gift is that they

are they live in a timeless reality

where they can just kind of just through

sheer ennui they can decide I might as

well learn how to [ __ ] like make ink

they forget that they know it until

thousands of your lives like oh that's

right perfect

anyway so was there anything else for

you folks cuz we got another customer

coming in right before we were talking

about some read some sort of red metal

blood metal yeah that's what we're

talking about when you talk about the

mage color although yeah they call

that's the one breaker yeah yeah I mean

that's kind of harder to come by because

they always don't like giving that stuff

out oh no they get really angry when

people come and grab that stuff yeah

yeah in fact if they know if they know

you've got any red metal it'll come

after you I don't have any but okay what

do you mean I don't have any huh well

yeah like so there's a couple of

different elvish metals right there's a

star metal that has a Sun metal uh uh

there's the blood metal there was a

couple more - uh we don't get the same

thing no no they all do different things

yeah yeah but they're all good they all

take and shatter real well yeah that's

kind of their thing is those elvish

metals they you can cast all kinds of

spells into them and get all sorts of

crazy weapons oh yeah hmm yeah so

they're but they're all different so I

mean we can keep our eyes that does it

have to be the blood metal or would you

take some like some of the as long as

them I mean as long as it is a mage

killer okay yeah we I catch I can read

between the lines men do that but no you

guys are mercenaries we know how it is

[Laughter]

as far as shields go

we are lots of shields what can you mean

like a magic shield alright yeah yeah

what kind of shield you looking for

spell dirt field what's up yeah that's

that's kind of in the realm of we don't

like that's kind of when you say spell

card that's the thing we were talking

about a minute ago right dianna make

this that's hard that's hard to do like

being able be making something that like

there's um there's a spell I don't

remember who it's now I don't think I

remember was named after but it's a

globe that you it surrounds you and it

makes us so spells can't get in huh

waymond oh that's the guy with the huts

yeah yeah my he made houses and stuff

like a mansion no that's that's a

different that's the end guy damn guys

died mansion and Leland is the oh yeah

maybe Lehmann worked for that em guy Oh

probably a huts or smaller dimensions

yeah so no like the globe of

invulnerability that's just a regular

everyday spell you can cast to make it

so that make it so spells don't work on

you but if you want like actual like you

know there's a chance ain't I'm so we

cast a spell it just don't work that's

really hard to do that's why I say like

oh why not

not just don't work yeah it's a little

speaking player terms it's uh you get

advantage on saves that's magic

resistance yeah yeah that's that's

powerful magic okay powerful he's well I

mean you can get a brass man I mean we

could pleat like if we knew where brass

man was we would let you know but we

don't like I think the brass men they

guarded ring well so we're back to ring

well again but look at your field yeah

sure yeah we got a bunch of them yeah

you can get a plus-one shield on this

maybe if maybe maybe get a shield of the

magic property but otherwise if you want

something like like legit magic

resistance these guys aren't gonna they

don't like that's super powerful because

it's permanent right the thing is it

makes its own magic doesn't work on you

or you know there's a it makes it much

less like that the magics gonna work

right there's no trade-off so yeah just

remember as shields on powerful

that's not the case you can just get a

plus-one shield that's no problem yeah

that's pretty great have you come across

an item no that's a good joke though

we've heard that one before yeah yeah

they were supposed to be this party that

was searching for the head of Vecna but

I think it was a trap

yeah I know one of the guys was like

look we found it instead of Vecna but

like the hand right like there's this

hand of Vecna knowing he had done knows

yeah the nose of no it's on it's an eye

okay I thought I know is that stupid

yeah the eye and then you have to cut

out your eye to put the hand in I mean

the eye and yeah and you're gonna cut

off the hand to put the hand on yeah so

these guys thought they had to cut off

their head to put the head off okay I

think that was the joke and so they were

arguing about which one of them was

gonna cut off their own head first yeah

I think there was a point where like

they were like competing to see which

one of them could slice off their own

head yeah but the thing is there ain't

no Hannah vecna that was just a joke oh

they were just a bunch idiots yeah but

we heard that story before

yeah when you sell magic items for a

living you hear all that stuff all the

time

haha so did you get anything out of this

I think they can look for they can look

for boots for you they can look for the

ingredients for a weapon speed so when

they say look for that look for

something is that then they will contact

us

yeah well have the dead guy get hit you

got okay yeah or one of his pee like he

runs a whole law firm yeah like we don't

see that guy that often we see his

clerks coming here all the time yeah

he's one of our biggest customers yeah I

think I like the idea of smithing a new

sword mm-hmm the booth blade is just

like shaped like a the boot of death

grab my eye on stone say would you want

to trade I on stones we got lots of I

own stones though I mean we'll take it

if you want to get rid of it maybe give

me something else you want maybe a

different one yeah okay like which one

you want

insight is that the wisdom one yeah

is that what feels good no feels not

getting an iron stone oh he's getting

Lucy mm-hmm I don't know which I ever

stones they have they don't have all I

was just looking at that because I

didn't know what they did yeah there's a

lot of them no oh thank you yeah here we

go

holy [ __ ] stop this is not these are not

all real

are they not yeah and say not all these

not all of these I think are official

really I don't think so yeah or

increases by two to a maximum of 20

while this incandescent blue sphere or

about your head we got this one yeah you

got the whole box full of little gems

and stuff and trinkets people they got

this one this all makes you faster yeah

like movie yeah I get warp so Timescape

to make it so that instead of moving 35

feet you move about 35 feet yeah it's

all 1 to 6 ratio or 1 to 7 yeah no

instead of 30 feet Oh 30 35 more mm if I

wouldn't say 30 feet he'd probably say

like 6 he goes instead 6 feet you go 7

feet extrapolate it out to a movement

and it's it's by 5 feet after 1 yeah

yeah so do literally movement not

necessary

correct um I know this is just like a

very magical story but do they just have

like half light liner honored show you

go to a blacksmith for that kind of

thing uh you couldn't tell you if you

need a hem I mean if you need half plate

you can just buy something ok perfect

that's Adobe they'll be totally mundane

hey um actually you know what it feels

not getting a horrible weapon they make

like vorpal finesse weapons no weapons

have to have a blade and rape yours and

stuff like that tend to be piercing hmm

yeah it's gotta be slashing so you can

walk I've got a scimitar a scimitar and

a scimitar korpal scimitar oh and you

can thank you could make that oh yeah we

could probably find something like that

but what are we lost count now are we

looking for the boots are we look

for the blue mercury or do you need of

up 11 yeah I'm looking to upgrade my

firepower here yeah I get it okay well

the deck I said we should help you out

so I mean you could pick whether or not

you want a weapon the speed or whether

you want a horrible weapon and we can

help you out all right I go take a

couple days probably yes be dude wasn't

five feet five more feet yeah the weapon

of speed Oh weapon if he's sorry third

still talking about this I think gives

you an extra tack oh that's really good

yeah not an extra tag action just it

gives you it gives you an extra bonus

attack and it gives you like what plus

to attack and damage rules too but see

that's what's in the dams guy right he's

gonna like everything in the DMS guide

is an example and there could be like

Mike here this is obviously this is not

sue Matt poll talking but my like there

used to like the best paladin weapon is

a Holy Avenger and when you look in the

DMS guys the holy venture does all this

stuff it gives you it gives you

protection from magic it could sue all

this other stuff but you could not find

that item in any regular adventure if

you found a Holy Avenger in a published

TSR adventure it had a ton of extra

stuff on top of that it would have like

a name it would have all sorts of crazy

abilities so the things in the dams

guide are are kind of templates they're

examples of things in the world but

they're not the only ones there can be

lots of different variations that's what

they mean when they were talking to Phil

about how what is it you want do you

want like a doing a magic weapon they're

doing a vorpal weapon because it'll be

real hard to find you imagine vorpal

weapon it's not hard to find your magic

weapon it's not hard to find your wood

so it's not hard to find your magic

weapon it's not hiring firing your volt

protocol weapon of speed but finding

like a +2 weapon to speed that's that's

beyond the bounds of the deal with the

dead 10 okay uh definitely weapon of

speed then Nexus

okay well look into old get back here

I'll see if we can get some blue mercury

probably I think we can probably yeah

that'd be great so is there anything

else you folks need I think we got all

your orders are you just gonna take that

heart with you do you wants to wrap it

up or something please put it in a box

okay no problem oh hey do we got a box

yeah maybe like a leadbox or something

oh that's a good idea yeah well we

brought up the bag at the beginning wait

you don't think you asked for a go I

said sending stones in that about

getting oh that's too much then then we

don't have to worry about boxes it does

have to be oxygen in it

a bag of holding yeah I'll give you that

holding those are they going here yeah

sure yeah yeah art and the bag yeah

guess we put everything everybody hope

everything guys in we all got these

weapons what you get got all these cool

weapons and anything yeah I needed they

didn't have that they're gonna have to

yeah they look for it just like just

like the blue mercury all right can I

just box before the heart can I just

basically go get it blacksmiths with my

flam brush and it will just upgrade it

cool thank you the style you gotta make

sure that I know so yeah I've made notes

here and we can talk about this stuff

afterwards but yeah also like just so

like everything you folks been asking

about but we get it you folks are

mercenaries yeah and you guys are really

did we mention you guys are really

nicely dressed for mercenaries yeah yeah

it's a thank you yeah it's nice to be

talking to people who take care of

themselves and look nice and get nice

outfits like I don't think I ever seen a

gift that walking around and hope it

like that no no normally the mercenaries

and stuff they got all sorts of dirt on

them like I don't know who raised those

people no it would be like imagine if

we'd or just never pruned ourselves oh

I'm so gross because then you get like

things start nesting in you yeah things

will nest in us they will like like

birds

oh by actually I like I like birds it'd

be nice to have like a burden okay yeah

that's and we get that but just so you

know the dead man was sort of saying

that if there was anything we could help

you with as far as like I don't know

like war and stuff like that hmm and let

you know because that tends to be our

specialty oh yeah

like all this stuff all this stuff just

comes through here it's no big deal but

if there's anything that we know or

could find out to help you let us know

and we'll we'll help you out

can you uh can you get us information on

a wizard named Morden that's a Jax's

wizard though right yeah oh yeah okay

yeah that guy he be really

angry though okay like it because it'd

be sort of hard to figure anything about

that dude because he would know well

yeah he's got that we like you we don't

want you to get hurt what about but like

that guy probably came for we could

depends on what you want to know I've

even talking about upgrading the ship

you mean

with what with being able to recognize

people oh oh yeah you'd mentioned that

Alright asking about them we on tell

them we have a yeah isn't an ill the

third squid ship or it's a Mike it's a

mine flared red not yeah mine flared red

not all that explains it

oh and they point to the sand the

dancing those tiny dancing sin oh that

was you guys I bet right yeah yeah you

guys have one of those and he describes

the Navigator I have actually forgotten

what kind of creature the Navigator is

yeah you guys have those things they use

a the beholder lava larva and they breed

them into their navigators yeah yeah now

we're now we get it we thought there was

some kind of like like an invasion

happening is a second people thought

there was some kind of invasion happen I

was just you guys I would one go about

upgrading the capabilities of that

navigate oh yeah that's a poser how

would you do that yeah cuz those things

are alive or they're living and they

they have I mean you could breed one

that would do it yeah that would

probably the easiest way is to breed one

yeah I'd be grossed though cuz you gotta

go find out the older tadpole yeah I

don't wanna have to do that yeah plus it

would take years

oh well yeah that would take a long time

so you already got one no when you want

to make its brain work better so like if

we wanted it to be able to recognize

individual yeah I bet there's a way to

do it yeah yeah yeah yeah that's an

interesting challenge yeah yeah I think

I just want to know how to do I figure

it out yeah well dad for your free won't

even tell the dead guy yeah so we're

gonna look into it and see what we can

figure out and see if there's some way

you could kind of like I don't know like

maybe feed it something yeah like

changes diet yeah I don't know what we

would be to tell probably some kind of

like some kind of metallic maybe a

crystal or something yeah am i doing it

anyway we'll figure it out

are you able to like look up things that

are just what's happening in the world

currently like after research either

well we know people we got lots of

different customers and we got

tones of lore and stuff like that so we

got all sorts of ways

figure stuff out we got also we got they

all three of them put all but a finger

to their nose and goes you have trade

secrets yeah we can't tell you that some

of our trade secrets like obviously

somebody ratted us out whenever we try

to get our our contract done whenever

you're in black bottom and so based on

the journal that we found later on his

suspicions that Kenway Abdul Rath is

maybe that rat but he doesn't know how

to go about finding that information out

I mean if that were the case that would

dolla fire contracts exactly so I'm

sorry what are we talking about

you guys are whispering to each other

sorry yours we're like I know we're a

lot taller than your folks are yours are

high off the ground it's hard to hear

you sometimes so you like to know where

crazy magical items are oh yeah useful

in our line of work so you know that

Ajax has that Jade hand yeah yeah he's

would you be able to tell us the other

things he has uh I don't know that he's

got anything I mean he's got armor and

yeah we could probably give you a nice

sort of like an itemized list of the

stuff that we think it's got yeah well

it's only we think yeah we never met the

guy

no no I know did he come here ever no I

don't think so I think he has another

curator yeah yeah he's got one of the

other guys so we could probably find out

we might even be able to ask his curator

what he's got yeah sure yeah you

probably tell us that characters old

time well I mean most of us talk to each

other yeah it's a trade show yeah do you

know anything about the attack that

happens well which attack that the

shadows that attacks master boots here

oh you mean like in the city no we don't

get out we don't leave though we don't

leave our manifold that often the thing

is Ajax has all not only well helpful

I'm not gonna be immature very helpful

but also knowing if our contract doesn't

nullify it would be much more important

what's this contractor talking about

mercenary yeah who are you working for

at the moment

lady cereal oh yeah we know her yeah

let me see I think I think she's I

didn't finish you and I yeah I heard she

died they actually died it sucks yeah

her dad is super cool oh he's the king

of the elves do you want to ask them

where do you want to keep it under our

hats uh well so do I mean speaking

speaking out of character like that kind

of nullifies the right and pain we're

doing if that's a game II know I mean I

guess it is but I mean go ahead ask your

question I don't think I'm sure you got

how to word it cuz cuz basically judge

wants to find out what there is to know

about the Lord can way of dollar and I

believe he's in possession of the shield

of Andrew if you're familiar with that

are you sure it's does shield cuz I

heard he had that crown somebody took it

from security doesn't that's [ __ ]

[Music]

who's Sigurd stop playing my old game

play that game again sucker the clock is

always ticking just wants to find out

what there is about Lord can we have

doll wrath

he's still first alright I don't know I

think it's embezzle aureus it's too far

I mean we shouldn't spend time on it if

it's well I mean we spend most of our

time in this matrix so we're not really

like where things are outside your

manifold is kind of we're not super

clear on that stuff but uh well we sort

of keep tracking stuff and that's when

they look at the little say what is this

oh that's our translation plot what is

that oh well so what it does is and they

point to the Sam you know the tangent

norms are never zero right oh yeah yeah

the other one goes yeah tangent norms

are never zero somebody could just I

mean technically somebody could just pop

in at any moment

oh yeah or pop out yeah that's always

possible yeah oh it's super unlikely

though yeah I don't think I've ever seen

it so this and show you if there's

descriptions yeah anytime somebody comes

or goes we can see it in here yeah

usually like if you just wait and watch

you'll see something happen and well it

does it look there is thought and a

little thing wait wait like a little

sand like it likes like like there was

something in the sand when about buoy

shot a little thing up yeah yeah that's

probably somebody going to alloy yeah

when you folks used your squid ship

thing there was a huge big spike and we

were like oh what's that but now we know

yeah but this is just a local area yeah

this is just like I don't know this is

just a few thousand hoover's yeah this

is basically capital and about a hundred

miles around it is what this maps and it

just shows you anytime

it's just it's just a little sensor that

lets them know when someone leak comes

or leaves this universe

alright that's cool never mind the whole

we could find out for you if you need -

is there something if this is something

you don't know it sounds more like a spy

thing yeah yeah your your taunts are

probably best to turn elsewhere so is

there anything else for you folks we got

another customer coming he's started to

talk about mortem and then you we cut

you off yeah he's a Jax's wizard yeah

that guy is that guy's nasty he said

he'd be mad if he was like well there's

something I can say oh I don't feel like

he's got lots of wards and some of them

are really nasty they might go off like

even even here well but nothing not in

it wouldn't reach into the matrix okay

see this this matrix is sub additive

that means it's still part of the

manifold oh that's right

yeah so he definitely could like we're

not in like even though it's bigger on

the inside that's not somebody I don't

know never mind because the dead guy's

gonna be he'd be upset at us if we uh

just like you don't mean like upset no

no don't take it the wrong white we

don't mean upset like upset but he was

like what like

what's the Lord like was it what does it

mean well I don't know what to even ask

really well like you I like what I can

ask like like this um you should write

this down as strong as your five gimme

like yours wonder about the Jade hand

they're gonna tell you about that mm-hmm

like what it can do what it can do it

and where he got it and they think it

was before before Ajax showed up with

the Jade hand mm-hmm they would have

assumed it was in ring well so it's kind

of like if you know that it's obviously

it's not because they would know if

somebody had found Roman so it's like if

you know about any proper nouns in this

world so far that we've encountered like

we can ask that question about like this

item or this person yeah that's that's

the that's the problem with the curator

is that you guys aren't actually members

mmm and and when I say that I don't mean

like I mean you guys don't know enough

about the world yet to know what

questions to ask so that's why when you

guys are these things are coming up and

sometimes they're like huh and sometimes

like oh yeah we can tell you that no

problem I'll just give us some time like

so the jade hand is one of those things

where like the example I gave to

Lawrence is imagine you get a chance to

go talk to Indiana Jones right like just

in his office he's probably on some

crazy stuff if you're asking about like

Atlanta oh yeah I think I know where

there's a map to planets but if you ask

him about the mayor of Detroit you'd be

like and that's doll wrath

right so you gotta as you guys learn

more about the world and as you guys

learn more about capital and all that

stuff you can have you'll ask you'll

learn what kind of stuff to ask but I

thought you guys do a great job by the

way you guys have getting a lot out of

it Center which it has all the things I

want to ask him are uh this character

doesn't know anything about those things

yeah you know unless you ask well I'm

just saying like like a judge wouldn't

judge wouldn't know so he just want to

make sure you folks are happy so though

if you say anything to the dead guy

that's good

that's all well I'm out of answers okay

I'll make sure did you get anything uh

you gave me a steal

oh that's right yeah sure I did I I'm

the one who asked for the diplomats

pouch oh yeah I don't count those though

those are just for like the group those

are just like a courtesy yeah it's like

kind of like a like a like I go in a way

present yeah you guys couldn't keep

those yeah no that's that's not even

part of the deal we just want make sure

you folks get the stuff

you need ya within reason oh yeah with

any reason mm-hmm anyway was it that so

if you were talking about two things

where they were talking about the

detection ring or there's a ring that

does both as a ring of mine shielding

knows I am a little proof against

detection location okay yeah we have one

of those oh yeah those are super

valuable yeah yeah what do you want for

it no we just have the amulet what did

you get a name to prove against

detection efficient I think I'm sure

that's not treasure from the previous

campaign no we got it

when we got the psionic crystal right

and that's wrong there it was on that

chip that stuff was all randomly

generated according to though it was

amulet and require a tumor I don't know

but probably the ring of mind chili

implants pretty rad yeah that's why they

don't got one yeah I mean I'm trying to

think of how we would use that amulet

and I think we could probably trade up

for something that's more effective for

us because we're six people yeah it's

like having it all one person it's like

okay they don't know where I am but they

know where boots is well I could just

send my that is the best that is the

problems like we want to hide the

chronical it's like well yeah but you

also have to hide all of you okay I

guess the one you guys has it you know

or you can lead into it yeah it's tricky

yeah anyway so if you folks will excuse

us we got another customer coming all

right goodbye sumac holders this has

been delightful

yeah well we'll send you a message for

trading that uh necklace at some point

we'll have the dead guy gonna hold you

anyway thank you for visiting the

permanent transient still something on

the way out yeah it's just on the way

you tried to

you're off the team so you notice as two

of the sumac poles are moving through

their inventory and getting stuff or

don't kind of reach snatches it like an

invisible not that they're belches and

they're like some sulfur and brimstone

comes out so yeah now is his 2211 it is

4:30 in the morning this was our first

shopping episode and I have notes that

I'll get back to you guys on probably

not before you guys start your next job

but probably by the time you're done

with the next the next job right now the

only thing on your plate is the half elf

Herald so he's gonna come by and talk to

you we'll probably all play that

beginning a next week and ask if you're

still interested in the gig but unless

you guys have some other and maybe

somebody else will come by and give you

guys an offer that's possible I got a

week to come up with something but right

now that's the only thing on offer how

do we get our weapons and [ __ ] made

before we go on an exhibition well

you're gonna need like a smithy there

might be there might even be one on the

on the what do you call it on the on the

somnium to neveress weren't we even

saying that like since you know

blacksmithing that's my thing like you

might be let's know something three no

it's gonna take a while so it's gonna

it's a down time activity so it all

depends on how long you guys want to

spend between jobs like if you want to

tell it wills left if you want what the

guys name lifts with if you want to tell

what to go screw like we got to spend a

couple weeks making weapons maybe that

job will still be around maybe not but

stuff tends to advance the clock is

always ticking okay but I think we could

just follow it down I'm fine it blacks

me back to they are no wizard or there

is

I even know I'm gonna do this Mel yeah

but I'm gonna make a wet armored weapon

I'll tell you that EJ wanted to do

something that was not allowed by his

class and I was like well it like spend

a couple of weeks trying it and then

eventually it'll start working right

like he wanted to he wanted to wield a

two-handed weapon one hand mm-hm I'd

like to be able to do that well I mean

you got his in his case it was he was a

half work and it was an orcish weapon

and so I'm like if you train basically

it's a feat I gave him a feat which I

don't normally use but this is a way I

could award it so you would have to

you'd have to suffer some indignity for

some while like I'm gonna wear this

armor even though I suck at it and it

kind of screws me a little bit but then

after a couple of sessions you'll get

used to it and be able then you'd get

this feat of even though Morlock I can

wear this armor but there's also Sioux

map will tell you that there's the zoom

Apple knows there are ways to make armor

from ages it's just that they don't tend

to be I get a better armor class mm they

tend to do other magic stuff okay well

like its it like this famous there's a

famous sin metal suit that gives you

displacement it's not it doesn't make

your armor class any higher that's what

it makes you're basically like uh all

those elven metals all those special

metals you like think it I'll take you

all take enchantment really well so it

depends on what you want to do with oh I

need to do a Reese yeah yeah and this is

stuff we'll talk about in our discord

over the next week uh it'll be fine I'll

be fine yeah you'll ride out from Union

no no fighting no no attacking just role

playing and me doing a lot of monologue

ah well I was gonna call this episode

the shopping us yeah yeah guys got a

huge info dump and you got some dos a

magic combination of magic items and

beating the ingredients to make magic

items and next week we will figure out

whether or not you folks take the island

job or some other thing it presents

itself to you or whether or not you guys

have your own plan that you come up with

that you want to do independent

of the offers people are making so

thanks for watching everybody I hope

that some of that was fun or interesting

I had a blast playing okay can we just

come back at any time with that I don't

think that's the one off yeah like if

you guys leave and come back it's uh

it's like a florist shop like it's not

it's not so it need to get it like the

dead guy would have two umpires yeah

well that's the idea yeah I mean it is

possible that you guys could through

political maneuvering and the deeds you

perform in capital you guys could have

met you guys could end with your own

curator but even then like the curator

you would be a member of that Club it

wouldn't be like right like something

like sue my poles never just gonna work

for you you can have all this stuff no

but they can they would they would say

no a lot less if there's a bunch of

stuff that you guys asked for or talked

about and they kept their mouth shut on

because they don't work for you they

work for the dead guy maybe Tim and

their other it guy and guys membership

well you know a little bit more about

the dead guy now so that's up to you

folks thanks for watching everybody

we're all gonna go to IHOP see you see

folks next Wednesday apologizing at the

very latest we'll definitely do a lie

I'll do a probably FDLR nethack

livestream on Monday night yeah that's

it until next Wednesday P by e be seeing

you
