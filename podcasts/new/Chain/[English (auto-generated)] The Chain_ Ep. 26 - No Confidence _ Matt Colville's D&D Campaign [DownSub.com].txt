so King gets the message from angel

saying that the college kid wants to

speak to him and you have correctly

interpreted that that is Marcella Scipio

hmm and going back to the dancing

minstrel Scipio was waiting for you when

he sees you probably the rest of the

crew come in as well and when he sees

you guys come in he stands up and he

approaches you and he says we should

talk hmm sure

lead the way nah here that's fine

lead the way and he'll take you out into

the city and it'll get on a carpet and

the two you're gonna take a carpet to

one of the northern districts of capital

which is a very posh place I think it's

called

castor Gate and he takes you to so the

the flight this is I think the only the

second time King has ever taken a carpet

ride but Scipio is just making small

talk on the way there and asking kind of

general questions about like how do you

like staying at the dancing minstrel do

you guys actually spend time there how

long do you spend you just sleep in the

dungeon that kind of stuff and then he

takes you to a tavern it's a much nicer

tavern than the dancing minstrel and

it's got like booths and stuff which the

dancing minstrel doesn't have it just

has tables and everybody there

recognizes him and he grabs a table this

place is call you were first do it he

says well we'll go get something to eat

add to the cup of blood but the sign

outside says the the wine chalice and

it's just got a like a goblet of red

wine pouring out and he sits down and he

buys your drink and he says I thought

you should know how things went with

Lady Rose 'var so I think that I think

the moon elf that we serve has taken

care of the problem well we're not I'm

I'm not exactly clear on that

there was a long debate between some of

the senior members of the order about

about what to do you've met the vial

silencer he was very much in favor of

just wiping her memory but it was

decided that that's not really our style

so we left her as she was and I

personally petitioned the pale light the

health that we serve and she answered

and she took care of the problem lady

arosa bar is gone

gone where I don't I don't know I don't

know exactly the vial silencer and some

of the senior members of the order think

that then she probably moved Lady Rose

of are in time and he like picks up his

glass and the one place and drops into

another because it's a kind of something

the Celestials like to do so we don't

know how much time we've been bought

weeks months the Lady Rose of our is

probably gonna come back so that means

the church is just gonna know about ring

well I think by the time this is done

the entire city is gonna know about ring

welcome it's only a question of time and

we've always been on the clock so it's

important that we speed things up if at

all possible you should know that I

think you did the right thing but at the

end of the day I mean you could have

very easily just dispatched Lady Rose of

Oran you didn't and that was tough but

bring here to us we're not really

equipped to do that kind of stuff I

could sort of why we rely on the chain

you guys can do things that we can't

we're sworn to stop evil and we take

that seriously no matter where we find

it no matter how hard it might be to do

no matter how we know it's not like

taking the easy road and doing something

like wiping Lady Rose Avars mind

after much debate we decided against so

I've already said this to boots but in

future you have to be careful how much

you tell the while silencer that makes

sense

mm killing an innocent Knight isn't

really my style

well you're gonna have to do a lot of

bloody things before this is done

dealing with something like lady erosive

are not the least but that's why we use

the chain I I lobbied to use you and

they listened to me so it's something of

my reputation on the line

don't bring something like Lady Rose

'var to us again understood mmm how was

ring while going I think we've hit a

block hmm we've explored everything that

we can in there there is the golden door

with the runes around it that one of the

black iron pact has gone through but

it's been shut lady or Rosa var said it

was by her we went down the other

corridors we encountered some sort of

plague a plague what kind of plague like

some kind of bacterial virus based

parasite based plague mm and what else

it seems to be protecting something

called the core cauldron of zoran on

which called it as or anon he takes out

a notebook any writes that down it up

and puts it back in his breast pocket

yeah that's something that your order

should probably look into cuz it's it

seems bad well that's what we're good at

we couldn't find these things out as far

as the stuff we found written then I'll

show them the mathematically wants a

copy that he'll take a copy of the man

huh as far as the information we've

gathered in there it's it says that this

is where they stored all the evil

artifacts primarily

yeah I think he says he points to the

map and he says I think there's quite a

bit more of that down there and it's

gonna get worse well on this on this

floor it seems to be only that so well

we're hoping to find we're hoping you'll

find more lore and more weapons to stop

Ajax with so that means we need to get

through that door mm-hmm what are your

thoughts so right now the only lead we

have is the woman who's posing as part

of the black iron pact says that there's

another way through the door the way

that the black iron pact got through

there was a wish things are hard to come

by

does she have any idea bishop any other

ideas how to get through that door she

says she knows how to do it she he's not

going to let us unless we can get her

out of there there's some sort of large

circular we assume keyhole we have no

indication of what that key is so right

now our best bet is to get her out of

the prismatic barrier and how do we do

that either gemstone Dragonborn or

destroy our psionic crystal I'm to bring

it down which we're not super inclined

to do the psionic crystal what does it

do it's uh our battle master used it to

read his weapon in some kind of

prismatic and this is a the the bio

silencer told me about this this is a

gemstone this is a chunk off a gemstone

dragon yeah well I mean manifestations

of a gemstone dragon can do almost

anything and all your all your battle

master was using it for us to cleave his

enemies the chains enemies and is he

willing to give up that crystal to let

this to get the information out of this

woman the crystal is a great tool to the

chain so we're not sure that the

information is worth losing that if

there was a way to replace that power

then maybe but we'll have to work on

that I can find some way I'll talk to

the vial silencer I'll bring this to him

something that slim could use

lieu of a crystal that he really doesn't

do much with anyway he's only using it

for that one thing correct so if we can

replace that functionality then you're

free to use that crystal to let this

woman out of her cage and then depending

on who she is she tells us how to get

through the store so she says that seems

like a reasonable path of attack are you

hungry

sure he orders food for you and says

what let me ask you a personal question

why did you join the chain I mean you

could have killed Lady arosa var and I'm

gonna guess that based on what I know

about the chain of Acheron and it's

senior command having met judge and slim

in Boots that at least one if not most

of them lobbied to take the easy path

and silence her forever and you said no

why does somebody like that join the

chain this

let's hear them giggling out there if

you want to talk about it I mean what

would he say to Scipio though uh I

didn't have a home to go back to and I

met a senior officer of the chain it

really showed me that you know there's

even when you lose all of that you

there's a place where you can find a new

family and a hope then he eventually

became the commander of the chain why

couldn't you go home

actually that's not I mean that's I

guess trade secrets and all that well I

I stuck out my neck for the chain and so

far

you folks have done a lot for us I sort

of felt as though the situation was Lady

Rose 'var was somewhat out of character

for the chain but I feel like I learned

a lot about you in the process if if you

ever need a place to go if things don't

work out with the chain for whatever

reason let me know I'll keep that in

mind so I'm gonna go back and talk to my

boss and see if there isn't something we

can do some resource we have that we

don't need that'll help out your

Battlemaster he wouldn't say that he

knows slim got slim because if we can

get slim to trade that crystal that we

can get that woman out of there I'm not

really interested in who she is I don't

need a vile silence or his either but

I'm interested in what she knows we feel

the same way well this seems like I have

an assignment I'll let you know what I

find out yeah I didn't tell more about

the cauldron the blob stuff that we

found in there just so we can ask about

it because we yeah he wrote it down we

got never heard of it

well I didn't I didn't say anything

about what we found

in it okay with uh Odie so you know

that's you you don't think that

something like I mean this cauldron it's

locked up in there for a reason right

that means it must have enormous power

probably not the kind of thing the

Sapphire sky would use but maybe the

kind of thing the chain would use it

really depends on what it is but with

what was protecting it I can't imagine

it's very good no yeah I see your point

there but I mean speaking pragmatically

is that the path to stopping Ajax

worrying about what's good I mean if I

were gonna give you some advice I would

say leave what's good to us I'll keep

that in mind that's your call I don't

mean to tell you your business how big

is this cauldron I mean is this

something you can get out of it the [ __ ]

it was really tall right I don't

remember yeah it's it's really tall and

there's something at the bottom of it it

doesn't I don't remember if there was a

stairwell or anything there's a stairway

up to it or something like that

oh yeah I know od flew it was a lap down

but we know it's just some kind of

gelatinous thing and it seems sketchy as

[ __ ] I don't I don't I'll find out

what it is all right well let us know oh

well and other than that he's just gonna

want to like hang out and finish the

meal and then he's gonna take you back

to the dancing history yeah well then

just to make it clear to him as of right

now we're at a standstill with how far

we can go in here if we didn't make that

clip Bob and he points to the room with

lady Valenti oh he says but no clue yep

so we pull at that thread and see what

happens he says I'm pretty confident

given the resources of the vial silencer

in the sky that we can come up with

something that will make Slim happy and

give us the use of his crystal

but that's gonna require research and

maybe some negotiation I'll let you know

what happens all right sounds good you

can go get Tom if you have some yeah I

don't know his name the guy with the

boots

sorry for the delay everybody my

tapestry had a hole in it find your page

so yeah you've received this invitation

somewhat cryptic yeah invitation to some

kind of like after dinner and nonsense

at a place called the bookbinders Club

mm-hmm

taking a carpet to the if you ask

anybody at the dancing minstrel that

will tell you that the bookbinders Club

is in a very posh district of the city

called castigate castigate okay can I

make a roll to see if I like if I from

my youth living in camp yeah yeah if I

remember anything from about what

remembering about what like if I've

heard of the bookbinders Club sure go

ahead

um just our regular history check and

you were you were born here in you lived

here so you can get advantage on that

okay well take that that's a 19 is your

total what is that what you're older is

that your total yes

okay it's does your is your history

bonuses zero it's foots not a student

history uh you know person uh yeah no

the bookbinders Club is I wouldn't say

it's famous there are a lot of

gentlemen's clubs throughout the city

it's a very kind of not --is-- thing to

do a lot of noblemen have their own

clubs and bookbinders Club is just one

of those it's a it's a place where rich

nobleman go to hang out it's not I say a

gentlemen's club it's not it's not

gender specific but it's definitely like

rich old reopen blood all right

okay and you can get that yeah you can

list half a dozen of them off the top of

your head and you're aware that there

are a lot more it's a huge City Capital

Scott

two million people living it okay cool

well um I'll put on the fancy dad's then

I suppose all good stuff at this I

didn't want I didn't tell first and I

didn't want the prompt to you I didn't

want prompt you but good stop and get a

little address you're quite well expect

as you have basically two outfits you

have the temp outfit which is nice that

the tailor gave you but you also have

the actually quite expensive outfit that

gives you like advantage on diplomacy

checks and stuff like that yeah and I'm

gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to the

nines like prestidigitator hair up and

it's you know something a little a

little more elaborate awesome and your

your your vomiter chicly quaffed yeah

awesome decked out okay all right yeah

do you take a carpet or do you go by

coach uh I think I will um how far is it

from where I am I mean it's it's not

it's actually not far you guys are in

the the dancing minstrel is in a

district that's close to the center of

the city and actually on the same side

as castigate okay so it's only like I

think you might have to go through one

other district to get there including

the neighborhoods within the district

are the color-coded places on them yeah

but apart from that I mean my it's still

a huge city

it might take like 90 minutes and a

coach okay yeah I'll take a coach all

right a coach costs you one goal carpets

cost you ten but the advantages that you

show up and you're still looked well

quaffed you don't have you don't look

like you just arrived driving a

convertible with your hair oh yeah

screwed up Debbie Harry nonsense is

there anything you want to having having

arrived the coach will deposit you

outside on a tear Corolla on the street

that the book minors club is on and you

can see there's no a lot of capital

signage uses the words most cities in

orden still just have a picture but most

places in capital will actually say the

name of the place uh-huh

that's considered somewhat modern but

this place literally just had it's like

a whole brownstone very tall multi-story

building very narrow and it just

literally has like an open book in front

of it and it has the numbers of the

street that it is other than that there

is no all right well this is the place

all um is there anybody you like

standing out sighs they're obviously

like anything going on in in inside it's

it's it's it's you can see that it's

well lit inside if you're arriving on

time then it's in a clock at this time

and this latitude I think it's still

very dimly light out yeah you can see

this this is quite warm light coming

through the frosted glass and you can

see people moving around but you can't

make anything out okay there are stairs

leading up there's a knocker on the door

oh I'll go up and wrap on the door as

soon as you wrap on the door the door

opens and there is a somewhat like

straight out of central casting butler

type figure not literally a butler a

gentleman's gentleman who is who opens

the door and he's you know dressed quite

well but he's obviously a servant and he

says sir I will present my invitation he

takes and he goes ah this way sir

and he leads you through this very

ornate club there are lots of noblemen

in here it's a long narrow room and

there are smaller rooms going off to the

sides there's a dining room there's

table there's a chairs going up stairs

going up and there's quite a lot of

knickknacks from all over the world in

here the kind of the remnants of Empire

and so there's like a you know there's

Hegar and artifacts and all sorts of

stuff and there's a bunch of noblemen

walking around and having after-dinner

tea and stuff and talking to each other

and you notice that they all seem like

they're

different houses right if they are

showing their the symbol of their house

house they like the Raven of house

borona for instance there they're all

just sitting around talking to each

other and and it's a very thick layer of

smoke hangs over the whole place

is one of the first things you notice

when you walk in and he leads you the

butler leads you the gentleman leads you

to a small table it's like a little tiny

like you know coffee table that's in a

nook away from everything else huh and

says Lord Latimer will be with you in a

moment all right

would sir like anything to drink oh I'll

take a coffee he he retreats and a few

moments goes by and you see this

gentleman he's very thin he's not very

tall he's got white hair and that he

combs back he seems to be as Lorien but

he's that doesn't necessarily mean

anything he's dressed as a real and

Noble and he's about to walk up to you

and sit down and someone stops him and

says Lord Latimer and he has a whole

conversation with this person okay and

says says well I'll come talk to you

afterwards I have business to do he was

all I apologize I apologize most most

rude of me

and so this gentleman sits down across

from you and he has a pipe and he's like

thank you for coming I appreciate you

respond to my invitation

well it's Lord Latimer yes and you are

lieutenant baritone a of the chain aback

Ron I am I am I'm curious how you came

to well I suppose someone of your of

your status would be able to find out

such things but I'm curious as to why

well I mean we've been following the

escapades of your organization since you

came into the city I must say my

compliments to your man

or I'm perhaps I should say you're half

man he's he's quite good but you should

know that this is a this may be a very

large ocean but we are the biggest fish

all right yes well he's you know angel

does have his talents but you know we're

we're in a new situation and sort of

looking to expand our operations a bit

so well please deliver to your man my

compliments we know you're working on

something we know it's big and we want

to help yeah go on

well we lack details in that department

but given the nature of your

organization now we assume that it has

something to do with Ajax you don't seem

overly concerned with the politics of

the city or the well-being of its

inhabitants and frankly I don't blame

you

but if there's anything we can do

there's anything my organisation can do

to help your organization we would

consider it a great opportunity to

exchange favorites well pardon me for

fog and the gentleman who would let you

into the building approaches that's a

bunch of cigars and yeah sure I'll take

a cigar I'll you know kind of like I'll

allow myself a bit of an indulgence and

like being back in sort of real and

Noble situation that you know I haven't

really been able to like experience this

life since sure I left right it's been a

decade or so

yeah that's anywhere young man yeah so

indulge myself this a little bit yeah

are you carrying a weapon right now

that's Matt asking not this guy keep be

able to see I uh I think I would have

left I would have left a dancer I don't

think I would have brought that right um

just cuz that's a bit of a look sure

yeah yeah yeah it's an evil looking

weapon but I think I would have brought

I probably would have brought a

like a dagger or two okay and the staff

just just for sake of it it's easy to

conceal right is it concealed when you

say the staff you mean the rod of count

yes okay yeah so it's on your person but

you don't have it you know you're not

just playing and ranting correct yeah no

it's good no I'm not like brandishing it

about steal my coffee with it my

organization has quite a lot of

resources especially here in the city

and we're eager to help if there's

anything we can do well forgive me I

haven't I haven't done as much research

into you as you have into me what is

what does your organization is our

organization how how rude of me and he

takes a silver like card case out of his

wallet and opens it up and pulls a linen

card out and slides it across the table

ah the act in school that is that is the

we're the princes intelligence

organization that's right that's right

well it's it's pleased to make your

acquaintance Lord Latimer this says by

the way for the for the viewers it says

Lord Latimer city manager : capital the

acting school yes my Bureau is rather

well funded capital being something of a

large playing field and we like to keep

abreast of things that are going on

inside the city frankly we consider it

our responsibility to carry out the

Kings will err and we're curious to know

whether that overlaps at all with your

goals

well III have to imagine that there is a

some amount of overlap there certainly

glad to hear it yeah what we're lacking

at the moment is I think any real sort

of unified military force within the

city yes that would be a problem as I

understand it you've got one light

company of foot

you've got recently acquired one medium

company of scouts

and of course various and sundry

exhilarate members no no not a huge

force for a city as large as capital but

you're not planning on taking over so

right well and we're not politicians

either that seems to be you know a bit

of a detriment to our operation thus far

but you know we I think you know in time

but if we could if we could you know I

suppose our biggest worry is that when

Ajax arrives with the intent to conquer

capital as he has done the rest of the

world that if the cities and throws of a

war amongst itself and there's really

gonna be no one left to put up a fight

against Ajax in a floating Golden City

and talk Lords and all that nonsense

yeah it's rather a tricky bottle to

uncork that yeah but if Ajax words who

and I'm just musing here or if Ajax were

to arrive in a city with a with

leadership yes a unified city with a

unified are a prince one might say yeah

yes then I think that the odds would be

ever more in our favor

in that case and did you have anyone in

mind for this illustrious well I take

out a small silver card case Prince of

capital yep I mean I I might make some I

might make some joke about that you know

well my organization takes something of

a long view all the things here in the

city and across the world and we've got

our fingers in quite a lot of different

pies the issue of Ajax is both distant

and one that we feel confident will

resolve itself we're more curious

regarding what you're doing in Collins

Gate Collins Gate V that's where the

dancing moves really right that's that's

the air that's where your butcher

sockets and yeah uh a bit of a bit of

excavation into the layers

tell me go revisiting this issue of Ajax

coming to the city curious to know if

you were going to if you could choose

somebody in the city to put in the role

of this unifying force that you were

speaking of who might you choose who who

would the chain back this is a difficult

question for one well we can speak off

the record if that would help

yeah well of course we haven't had we

haven't had counsel with all of the

Lords of capital as it were hmm all the

powers that be

you met ladies roaming I really did meet

lady Shrek

yeah when you had something a little

dust-up on the pellet with prog dragons

how did that go uh well you know I mean

I I suppose it was a nice little

refresher to the way that these

political goings-on can play out yes a

bit of the you know the classic

backbiting and my imagine ammonia is

must be somewhat rough seas for a

mercenary company to have to sell things

in capital are always more complex than

the same yes well when you can just stab

something in and solve your problem it

yeah it's things are much more clear at

that point Paris I imagine there yes but

I I don't know that we have enough

information to go on to say that that we

could back a particularly turn or do I

think that we're entirely qualified to

do so like yeah why should we be the

ones to it's like I I don't think at the

end of the day that it it makes any odds

to us who sits on the throne of the

prince mmm very pragmatic very I respect

that

well I just wanted to make contact and

introduce myself and also and he takes

out like a little check

and I suppose do it well cuz he's about

to use a phrase that is in his in this

case not a metaphor oh he says he says

you know my business is all about

gathering information and I find it much

easier to do that if if we're friends

and we were exchanging favors so if

there's ever anything you need and he

actually writes his name

writes your name on a check signs it and

otherwise leaves it blank well and puts

it across the table and he says consider

this a blank check for you to use

however you see fit if there's ever

anything you need I'd like it if you

came to us first

all right well Lord Latimer this has

been a very enlightening meeting well I

thank you I feel the same way um bear

Tony what is the what is the nature of

the house that you're from well hmm can

we speak candidly of course man do yours

like a lot of people are out yeah

they're not but they're not they don't

appear to be listening it do you know of

the current whereabouts of my father or

my family

mmm what no I mean I'm sure this is

something that we could learn quite

handily I mean when they're tracking

down errant Nobles is is a common

profession here in capital all right

well I've been I've been away for some

time you said yeah intrepid travellers

as mercenaries tend to be as I had to

get out of town somewhat abruptly as we

we think yes yeah there was some well

was a long time ago um yeah if you could

find out for me just what seems to have

happened hmm with with my ancestral

situation here that information could be

of some use oh I'm sure we could find

something uh-huh

what outcome are you hoping for well

we've kind of been keeping a keeping an

eye peeled for any sort of unclaimed

strongholds within the city any sort of

lands properties that type of thing hmm

and difficult to come by those things

without making enemies yes well I mean

we're better dealing with enemies than

we are with the real estate on the

moment so well said well this is

definitely something I could look into

uh so uh this is just a Tom question

real quick is this is this guy a member

of the Privy Council is this guy a

member of the Privy Council no no the

Privy Council has the head of the Great

Houses on it so there's seven members of

the Privy Council the hell accounts bro

no the head of house I'll borrow the

head of house Navarre a head of house in

Valletta a head of the broad she guild

the head of the rasp and the head of the

fulcrum

those are her that's it okay all right

interesting I don't know if for some

reason I had the idea that they were

like a separate thing um okay sorry

let's get back to this - my conversation

uh I'm gonna ask Lord Latimer who he

would choose if if he were if he were to

choose someone if you could handpick

someone to be the Prince who and why uh

tricky to say yeah indeed I mean of

course if I had my way I'd have the old

Prince back yeah but if I were a betting

man I'd bet on how solve our oh yeah

Horace why is that well not to foot the

planet not to put too fine a point on it

because I think we'll win okay we

interesting use of the plural pronoun

there well I mean make uh like what's

make an inside check I don't know what

the right thing was me I wish I could

like that I could have let this if I

wanted you my office

oh that's it 22

so the acting school what is it's

actually a school like people study

there but it's also where the princes

spy organization operates out of and in

the absence of the Prince the the school

is part of the university and the

university is run by Alomar right so

when there was a prince these guys were

probably loyal to house to the prince

and the the goals of the prince and

Prospero Alvaro were the same but now

the prince has gone so now these guys

and this dude specifically like if you

look him up he's a member of house all

are right he belongs to a house belongs

to house Oro and they're a smaller sub

sect yeah also are all right cool well

would you would you say that in your

estimation that the that the military

force of house Alvaro is the strongest

in capital among the among the houses

infection I mean um you know we

routinely run war games and one of the

scenarios so that we cycle through is

what happens of a civil war in capital

breaks out and very quickly you learn

and that the resources of a single house

are not that great a matter in the grand

scheme of things it's more the alliance

platforms yes and when you match house

Alvaro's quite a substantive military

and also our financial resources and our

intelligence Directorate and with

something like house Protoss Navy well

now you've got a world beater I think

they call it mm-hmm

yeah I couldn't I can see I can see that

it all depends on how the how the game

plays out indeed indeed well

let me think um this digging operation

yes you're mounting in Collins gate

that's a my safe and assuming that it

involves your continued pursuit of

Ajax's wizard in a way yes well this is

this should provide a means to gaining

us allies and and perhaps even some

tools to help us to help us carry out

this this job is there anything we can

do that

I'm sure there is I'm sure there is let

me think this so calling skate the

district that word in yeah

isn't is it piece of it's neutral

territory directives and princess

territory yeah and each of these little

pockets of the princess territory is

like its own city within the city each

have their own administration right so

it's not like there's a one

administration that runs all these

little pockets nope they each have their

own kind of so the red the red Falcons

or the kind of the City Guard before the

Paladin but the word of the city guard

the word that's right now the scrolls on

the shields right yeah again Lord

Latimer you'll have to forgive my you

know I'm rusty in me in the oh if you

love your one friend holic success stuff

I entreat you to relax in the

hypothetical situation that that you

were to have a military force move into

an an unclaimed territory in the city

yeah

what would the sort of ramifications

well I mean this is a this is a this is

not an unknown hypothetical right to a

man in my position well and actually the

the twelve dragons yeah

landed on the pellet and when you ears

and that got a little a little a little

prickly well dead Carano is notorious

for taking matters into his own hands

curious to see how that will play out I

don't think that story's over have you

read the broadsheets today

no I'm not I could have one brought I I

would say that the answer to your

question relies heavily on the nature of

this military occupation and furthermore

I would say that it had to do with who

that military work for who their allies

were say for instance not a foreign

mercenary company of dubious provenance

were to occupy a territory of the ones

held by the prince we might be convinced

to turn a blind eye to that and unless

we felt as though this this organization

was politically motivated and was

already in the pocket of one of the

factions in the city that we are not

well disposed here for instance if we

felt as though this was lady shoroma he

making a play to take over the princes

territory oh I'm afraid we'd have to

take a somewhat dim view of that in the

grand scheme of things and I would

expect to see some pushback there in

terms of deploying other members of the

City Guard or some of perhaps house of

Verona's Marines that depending on how

and they reacted to the scenario you

know if it becomes very complex very

quickly yeah but - you know this is our

business at the end of the day it

depends do you think such a thing as

likely I think it might be it might come

in handy yeah I can see how it would I

will say that if this organization was

one we were already predisposed to Oh a

favor - then I think that might oh well

aligned with our own goals all right

well uh let me just say this the it is

an apolitical third party

for which we are doing this little

digging operation mmm hmm that seems

unlikely to me if you had said that you

know if you had said you were working

for a unicorn I would take it more

seriously a political third parties are

are off to scribed but hard to come by

yeah well you mentioned a unicorn that's

really not far off

interesting manat particularly curious

about if it's not a member of the city

if it's not if it's not ladies romaine

I'm curious

would you say then that this digging

operation of yours is primarily a

contract that the chain is trying to

have a fill or do you see it as pursuing

your own goals here in the city are you

working for yourself or someone else

essentially this isn't this isn't the

typical like money exchanges hands ink

and paper type of contract that we're

used to this is a bit more a bit more

close to the chest as it were a bit more

personal that's a yes mm-hmm well III

think that under the right circumstances

if you were Frank with us then we might

be persuaded to turn a blind eye any

operations and in Collins Hill and might

even be persuaded to help but we would

expect something in return was for

instance just as a gesture of good faith

you understand if we knew the name of

the thing you're digging after oh we

might be able to help understood well I

say that was something you think about

yes if it comes to that meeting no

offense it's just that this is a bit of

a sensitive operation if we come to need

your help and we may well in fact need

your help

I can exchange I'm more than willing to

exchange information for for us at help

put it that way it's very prudent of you

it was my hope that we could establish

some sort of quid pro quo here just

among two gentlemen yeah I suppose I

mean you've you've given me literally a

blank cheque so it seems only fair to

extend that extend the the the kindness

of return the kindness of Flake some

information do you know of an

organization called the Sapphire sky mmm

Oh sounds like a cult no nothing up my

head that's the name of our unicorn ah

well easily looked up mm you know there

are many such but do I understand that

this is something you're telling me in

confidence

yes oh I see well the Sapphire sky the

Sapphire sky no does ring a bell but

I'll be sure to look them up I will I

suspect my organization so think it's

gonna become very interested in them

these are people that I imagine hmm

given the things I've read in the

broadsheets and the research my people

have done that there are goals must

almost by definition align with the

chains well loosely you understand that

a lot of the times the the alignment of

those goals happen only to the extent

that some people can't slay their hands

with type of thing I say yeah

yes politics makes strange bedfellows

yes I understand

interesting interesting and for this

relationship with this organization is

it to your benefit to currently I it's

mutually beneficial thus far we've gone

we've gone out of our way quite

extensively in the past few days to to

sort of entrench ourselves in this

operation so interesting choice of words

we're taking it very seriously despite

it not being this is pretty atypical of

what we do yes I imagine so now I know

that you came to capital to recoup after

the events of black bottom and yeah

common wisdom and now I'm inclined to

think that it's correct is that the

chain is going to devote itself to

fulfilling the terms of the original

contract and maybe going considering the

personal nature of what happened in

black motto

you'd be going above and beyond the

straight letter of the contract that

wouldn't surprise us and of course we

would be perfectly happy to see

something catastrophic befall Ajax

before he goes to capital but and I

predict that's quite a long ways off in

the meantime I appreciate the

information you've given us any

confidence still quite a bit curious

what you're digging for in calling sale

but I'm sure that's something we can

find out on our own anyway hang on to

that check and and I hope that your

continued association with this Sapphire

sky is to your benefit and if it ever

proves you know that they want more than

you're willing to give please don't

hesitate to contact us all right I'll be

uh yeah I'll be in touch he checked

monster you extend the same yeah

pleasure meeting you services please

actually doing business with a a

gentleman likewise I think that's it

alright alright we're gonna we're gonna

take a real take a break and gather our

forces and then come back and play D&D

tight we are MC D in productions and we

play Dungeons & Dragons

[Music]

[Music]

hey everybody my name is Matthew Koval

these are my friends who are a bunch of

game developers we hang out on Wednesday

night and we play Dungeons and Dragons

if this is how we know your time is

valuable if this is how you choose to

spend it we thank you

I don't remember what happened last week

but yeah you guys it was the autumn of

age

I don't remember we just did the

campaign diary for this which of course

you folks all watched and you guys

bought the auto page found the cauldron

Saarinen and you got it you both got

messages saying to people there are

people who want to talk to you you leave

the dungeon I think we'll each said he

wants to take a long rest he wants to

spend four hours if I can if you folks

are so that long rest happens after King

goes to talk to Marcellus Scipio at the

cup of blood and Boots goes and talks to

Lord Latimer at the bookbinders Club so

they you guys both come back and it's

probably like 10:30 yeah and at that

point it's sleep and come morning there

are new broad sheets oh yeah I before I

long rested I think I moved back home

come back in and like find our table

where the rest of the senior officers

are hanging out and just like slap down

the blank check you're like boom hey you

guys want to buy this district that

they're not the u.s. players know what

that check is but your characters do not

where'd you get that money from mmm a

piece of paper like the $2 that was

little blank quite purposefully I met

Lord Latimer city manager the acting

school so this guy is well connected

with our pal Prospero this is a

reference to something that happened to

a friend of mine in real life working at

a video game company the a bunch of

government guys want to come by and talk

to us about the game we're working on

who are you and why are you at our table

can't you see the band of mercenary

folks how'd you get in here anyway

yes I'm gonna grab it and look at it are

you grabbing the check are you grabbing

the card

no check I mean it's it it looks like

too slim this point of view it probably

appears to be a very very very short

contract like it just says I had it

signed

Lord Latimer and d'Oro I think it's how

it's how he signs it and it says agrees

to pay and that's nothing how much I say

signature it's empty so you can write in

any number you want that's the idea what

sort of the Sevilla stacked did you have

to dude he seems to want well I mean he

seems to just wanna what what everybody

else that we've met so far in this guy's

kind of position wants which is you know

he he wants sway with us right yeah

we're probably gonna end up being like

they don't work for him or what does he

want from her the thing that catalyzes

the war that catalyzes a new person

being made prince of capital speaking of

which the mornings broadsheets headline

says 12 dragons refused to quit city

building red Falcons surround

mm-hmm the library librarian okay so

they're still right now right now

they're in the library

according to the article there's not the

open hostilities haven't broken out but

that's what everyone's waiting for mhm

and lady Antonia who you may remember

was the head of red Falcons and you

watched the other guy

cut her down and then King resurrect her

mmm she's quoted in the article she's

quoted as saying the 12 Dragons has no

authority the library is a critical

element of the operation of the pellet

and they're not letting anyone in and if

the 12 Dragons will negotiate they will

force their way in and the reporter asks

if lady Antony realizes that that means

many of the City Guard will be killed

she says we have a clear duty and we

intend to do it unless I mean we could

probably we could probably help and

without even having to go down there

Lord Latimer did tell me that commander

dhikr oniy basically sort of writes his

own rules but I think we might be able

to I might be able to get him to piss

off dick oh that's oh yeah there is a

package waiting for King in the morning

dick irani work for same way the same

guys you just met uh-huh right he's a

bit robotic sounds of it right that is

in character with most of the Knights

you have ever met yeah okay is it once

what depending on lair there are there

people in the city who are Knights who

that's just part of their job right but

then there are hereditary noblemen

Knights and they tend to each of them

regardless without house they work for

March do their own they tend to think

that they're God's gift to whatever and

that they can do whatever they want and

I'd say right up with a sentiment I'm

gonna say that speaking as Lars the it's

the package is wrapped like looks like a

it could be a cut of meat it looks like

it's wrapped in butchers paper it's tied

with twine and it's addressed to King

that says from Marcellus laura's does

can't read Larsson that's but um see

what this is this is Matt wishes that he

brought his scissors use it to what what

good I mean why would we do that

other than I mean I think well no we

don't we don't we don't know the red

Falcons anything yeah well yeah I mean

did uh too late thank you um what did

you roll on your crystal do we have a

fully charged you go yes I rolled so if

we use the crystal to get her out make

it do this no they're in the package Oh

the trade they are this is a gift to get

us to use the crystal to free the

bracers whoa and they they they're not

as good as amplifier amplifies 3d8

the brain is only 3d6 however that 3d6

is the bonus that gift get when they're

using the silver sword on the native

plane like right if you look at the

Monster Manual stats at gift due to d6

from the great sword +36 psionic damage

someone would know what these are

yeah and then you know I mean you

recognize immediately that to the rest

of the group they look like

I mean slim even with

or he recognizes their provenance he

would recognize that they are gift made

because they are silver bracers that

have this crazy alien design on them and

you folks have been all over the

multiverse and there's all sorts of

crazy [ __ ] out there but he's like no

that's that's a gift manufacturer and

then if you hold them you're like oh

these are the silver bands of black if

yeah so we can keep those if we use the

psionic crystal they'll try to take down

the barrier so well like I said I mean

it's a it's it's up to you I mean you

you gave me the crystal to use if you're

willing to make that trade these are

very valuable it seems like a pretty

good trade to me speaking mechanically

as meek I think he was I think he was

thinking the same thing

well I'm not the activated oh he just

use it you just have him on that's is it

only weighs no in the in his plane yeah

and he can also punch people and still

do that he's giving up he's giving up

like on average three points of damage

those other things it does it does a lot

it don't know but I only use it for

amplify yeah if we had an in base

character it would be more useful I

think that the wise decision crystal

well the thing is I think I think slim

actually will need to use it in order to

break through the thing cuz he's a

little silent powers who think anybody

can use a crystal oh look where the

crystal gives you like slim ah natively

has some some psionic abilities we even

thought the crystal there's some things

he can do but anybody can use the

crystal the crystal actually gives you

psionic charges which only Dragonborn

have or only I'm sorry Devils you

gemstone dragon only gemstone dragons

have and chunk stone Dragonborn are

descended from them

slim gives slim gives King the the

gentlemen snatches up the the the

armbands and goes like back into a dark

corner and as like looking at them they

are they are allegedly there that mean

they're not unique there are the bands

that like any of the ladies nights would

happen and they're kind of they

represent belonging to an elite order of

gift Warriors hmm presumably the

Sapphire sky killed one of them

harvested do they love killing people as

long as they're evil okay do you avoid a

message that I'm sure we could get in

contact with yeah I mean I don't know if

we want to burn our blank check on hello

but if you're suggesting banding

tomorrow

like those guys like take her own works

for else lavarro we could just call this

dude and be like hey you need to like

look what - whatever what can we do for

you to get them to you know lick the

little library but to what end what what

does the facts get us since he likes us

or likes me at least we'd love to you we

could take over the library it's just a

place of as a stronghold yeah like a

maybe I don't know but ever like people

go to the library like house that's we

don't want people walking through our

stronghold doing I mean yeah I mean I'm

more inclined to be near and above ring

well until we solved I mean it's a long

long solve yeah yeah the library is a

civic building right right and it is on

a hill and it is one of the dots on the

city map one of the power centers in the

map or a couple of reasons not least of

which is it's a symbol of the authority

of the people who run the city both like

in terms of the culture of the city but

also just the sheer amount of

documentation that's in it like people's

marriages are certified because of the

documents in their people's land title's

are certified because of the documents

library and yeah the existence of many

houses the library is not the only

building in the city this is true of

there's over two million people in the

city but it's it's one of the 18 power

centers on the map and it is it is you

know if as far as like a war goes it's a

very defensible struggle it's a giant

it's a giant

it's a giant marble building on a hill

people use a difficulty right now but if

somebody it also cuts off Jeremy's

ability to establish fake houses because

they can't go get paperwork from there

probably could that's off our ability to

make our own fake houses as well in the

access to the library is not the only

way to forge as well but I mean like

this guy doesn't he's not the Prince he

can't just give us Prince's territory

all he can do is turn a blind eye if we

try to take it that Bread Falcons are

gonna have something to say about that I

would imagine

shoroma is people I mean everybody else

in the city is gonna have something to

say about that right there baby Elkins

are like our allies though mm wonderful

but if we try to take over their part of

the city like are they gonna just be

like okay cool I mean I think as long as

we don't you know with them like we we

saved them from these guys might be but

to be clear with this thing this is a

blank check for anywhere and yet the

city you're saying it's a blank check so

why would we not want to be above room

well I don't know no reason yeah I mean

don't get me wrong I like the red

Falcons but because it's a magnet of

[ __ ] trouble well I mean we're a

magnet of [ __ ] trouble

your mom continually continually pull in

trouble all the rest of the campaign

that's kind of the point of the game

right yeah yeah oh I was gonna say I

would have pretty much yeah I always

like slapping the check on the table

yeah

yes and what we washed we know about you

yeah yeah

is that true yeah yeah okay okay so you

tell them what happened

you don't leave anything out yeah that

was you yeah we know that you told the

spy organization about sapphire sky yeah

I feel like that'd be a good thing

because gonna attend the rest of the

senior command about it that current

information is revealed with somebody

outside the organization they're in

another dimension right like like

talking about unicorns and he's kind of

right you know so let him let him try

and let him try and find it pocket

dimension inside of a ring

so what admit mr. blank check want for

that Krista by Jake like what did you

give him for that I told him that if we

were gonna write this check that we'd be

in touch to to sort of make an exchange

okay Ferb for something we're using it

for either information or or something

yeah I mean he's definitely interested

in in you know what we're doing here and

calling the state so okay yeah hmm how

was uh how was your engagement sir it

was fine about the problems will bring

well about a way to get that woman out

of there about how we're gonna get by

that gold door is still our problem in

the future okay in the future the future

like tomorrow probably this let's go to

the candle shop we shouldn't talk about

this out here this is how people are

gonna find us dwarf and a half I know

it's um

you recognize you might be I mean your

characters probably recognize one or

both of its zeorge

who is the dwarf I was captain of the

word they're the princes troops here in

Collins gate

they're basically cops son of oh and his

halfling lieutenant is who's carrying a

notebook pencil following this guy

around his named Winchester spendthrift

as

zeorge looks around this dwarf is very

stout he's got he's got a shield on his

back which you've seen before you seen

him carrying it and as the device of the

word on it he's got two who acts on each

hip and apart from the fact that he's

wearing the princes livery he has he's

very kind of stereotypical dwarf looking

character there's a long beard and he

looks at it looks around his eyes adjust

for a second he sees the table that

you're all sitting at he points and he

walks over and and his halfling is kind

of quick following behind him and he

looks at all of you and he says the

chain of Acheron lately decamped from

the stays and now taking up housing here

in my district how lucky for us it turns

to spendthrift they have to do that and

spendthrift says sir no they did not

no they did not and stop that fungus

thing that was eaten everybody and

stayed to help clean up what do you make

of that

and while the halfling says very very

civic-minded of them sir

very civic-minded indeed but your men

five of your men get drunk get in a

fight with some of the boys from house

alvaro i lock him up and give him a slap

on the wrist and let him go as a favour

you between the princes men and he like

fingers the medallion that you're

wearing that has that lady Antonia gave

you and then he looks at the symbol of

the chain

he says but whose men are you really

that means you wear the Prince of Steel

fool you walk around in my city wearing

the Prince's seal and you say you're

your own men

I see where is getting that we've

already told them that we're we're doing

stuff for the Prince right now we're

acting in the interest of the city yeah

we told them really dragon that's why we

helped fight the dragon that's why we

didn't just take off when a dragon

started torching yeah yeah yeah yeah

yeah that's very it's it's very nice of

you

we helped lady Antonia when she was

slain by Dickie Rooney yeah her back to

life yeah yeah yes and she's in trouble

[Music]

[Laughter]

lady Antonina she's a good judge of

character

and she sees seems as though she

compensated you well for your service to

her he says looking at here princess

seal says but now you're here in my

district why not go back to the pellet

as we likely the engineer so much

butcher shop here though huh yeah real

good how are you planning on staying

here sausages why did you why did you I

said I said there's a really good

sausages oh I thought you implied that

well I say I misunderstood yeah I said

doesn't say that you carry the Prince of

Steel that means you must do the princes

business if you're gonna stay here in my

district we need to come to some

agreement what would you say is exactly

that you want to do we in for

blah we're the only thing keeping the

city together and if you're gonna wear

those medallions then you have to do the

same well I wasn't taking on a dragon

and clean up some mould pretty call very

heroic yes but wouldn't be done since

then it's dirty work

police say this enough it's not all

dragons and viruses you wouldn't say

viruses he would say funguses it's not

all dragons and funguses it's dirty work

pounding the pavement seep tankards

that's what we are I believe the term

pardon the interruption is fungi the

mold was very nice of you to stay and

clean up

are you planning on continuing your stay

and helping clean up doing what it takes

to enforce the law I'm sure we can spare

some men for that he kind of stops in

half in this area clean right where

we've been staying mm-hmm yeah that can

be improved the area mm-hmm

have you noticed any crime in this area

actually since we've been around our own

men getting drunk getting in fights

disturbing the peace I'm sure the other

ones instigated yeah what is he talking

who'd even buy it was Alvaro's men right

kind of like how and borrow all borrows

men instigated a fight on the pellet and

you're really gonna come blame us mm-hmm

I cut down he means he names a bunch of

they know about this fight no okay so

this is the first I've heard of that

yeah so it's just nine five

well it's I'm not an officer or members

of the chaîne so like those men will be

disciplined yeah we shall do with this

yeah sure you letting him out barbecued

Ronin quarter any ship certainly we

appreciate the favor

will reprimand them accordingly ah yeah

I did a favor for you but now you have

to do the dirty work of being the

princess men or get out of my district

so that paper it to us wasn't you paying

us back for us destroying this dragon in

the mold this is not new favor favors

yes you carry the princes seal so was

that an ornament what exactly are you

looking for here he wants us to do the

dirty work

dirty work

it was leader seems pretty clean seems

like it's been pretty clean since we

took care of that dragon in that mold

he starts listing like things that have

happened in the city since that's like

it's everything you would expect it's

he's a cop he's the head of the police

here in this part of the city and that's

what he and his men do is they hey you

sure whatever whatever it takes this is

the list long I mean heat like

Winchester spendthrift couldn't make it

long it'll be like Winchester didn't

know he does he'll spend 50 he's like oh

well he starts listing all this stuff

they've been doing all the break-ins

theft murder well why don't we give him

the five this is Matt give him the five

community service as their punishment

they'll clean up chuckle while we're

here these guys will work with you as

community service yeah not a bad start

as the punishment for a week well how

many of you how many of the seelye of

six of the seals alright yeah we've all

got sue

he says seems a fair deal you secand

to six of your men to me and six

you arrested five five yes you want a

sick well I'd like your whole company

would you like your name but I'll take

six ahead

six of your men while we're a while

we're in town Oh while we're staying

here while you're in my district correct

mm-hmm

yeah seems a fair exchange oh I would

have to get some poor other bugger then

think of it this way you're doing the

city a favor

yes that's together manual labor we get

send uh we though at this point the

doors open and things change any of you

like your you know paladin you're a

cleric a dark and evil presence enters

the dancing mystery mmm hair all the

while let's go her boots leave burned

smoldering marks on the wood floor of

the dancing minstrel as she walks in and

approaches zeorge as she's wearing black

armor and she has a black cloak on and

is dressed like a chivalric Knight not

like a knight of the city with a rapier

and fine clothes but like a you know

medieval kind of King Arthur night and

is obviously dead this base is shows

eons of decay and there's a black smoke

kind of slowly emanating off of her

shoulders and she walks up to George

who's talking to you folks and I don't

know what the reopen equivalent of black

gods is but whatever it is George says

it and Winchester spendthrift like takes

a step back and people in the end start

piling out and the owner of Ian who is

by

the counter guy was like like more of

this nonsense

ever it is and this death knight says to

zeorge

in a hollow voice it sounds like it's

coming a great distance echoing through

a mausoleum says there is an item here

in the city in your district oh my lady

demands it and zeorge turns to the

halfling it says do you have any idea

what she's talking about and she says a

rod this long black and gold with a

stylized hawk atop it bind this thing

deliver it to me and live you have one

day and zeorge looks at you and then

turns back to the death knight and says

you don't come into my city like you're

the prince himself who are you and who

is your master

[Laughter]

yeah yeah okay she turns she stops and

points to George and says you have one

day or I will burn out your brain and

then she starts to dissolve into a cloud

of smoke well and evaporates [ __ ] you

know you let filth like that in your

district no problem well if only we had

someone of your stature helping what did

you do stay there like one half struck

yes very well very well

I didn't say shorty here out there the

help rate is right let me know

funella run for your district you've got

lots of problems here it doesn't have

anything to do with us

yeah nothing I think it's got quite a

lot to do with you any details no way to

follow up how he instance to get her the

thing that she's asking for yeah it

sounds like you better get busy looking

for a rod about this long yes time

skipped inside black green and green

blue with the snake yes snake good night

Joe's got a rod about that life you are

seconds closer yeah ready spendthrift

let's get out of here well okay he gives

you the he tells you where the police

station is he says have your man report

in the morning

it'll be deadly yeah let's uh what time

is it it's yeah the report two hours

after that we're gonna get him we gotta

get him over from the stays and all that

didn't resituated no he's got more stuff

I mean just in case you know he's nude

meets he loves you lying are you laying

to the good officer I'm not lying I'm

saying we'll do it I'm saying build

rapport there right two hours after

right now just the [ __ ] death knight

came in and said he has 24 hours so if

he's not there when they get there we

don't want them to be there while the

[ __ ] death knight comes up and they

get murked

that's a fantasy

so anyways indeed sir

the swords is gonna take off yeah yes

get out

I did these Bank go as well been drift

oh yeah so well well they're they're

looking for this fictional rod

perhaps we should go and use the crystal

uh yeah let's go to the candle stop yeah

okay

it's the morning run we talked about the

candles and we normally take a break now

and I've been now running the game for

ninety minutes even though all these

people haven't all been together so I

now would like to go get something to

eat and take a bio break so we will

return we will return in about 13

minutes I'm glad I'm glad that's how you

feel because I means you'll be looking

forward to us continuing in about 13

minutes yeah start break let's try we

are back hey everybody if you've stuck

around this long then you are a true fan

and we appreciate it this is the point

after the break where we want to show

off some of the fan art if indeed there

is any it's always possible that we can

have a week well in a manner is there

fan art Lars Lars is the keeper of the

fan I don't and if you want him to

feature your art on the stream just mail

it to his home address which is it's

time to stop there's a hashtag chain fan

heart fan art - no change no change is

all change don't do it [ __ ] it up and

just write chain banner cuz he'll never

see it don't touch the chain fan art and

then Lars also views pension at hello

idiom on Twitter please please use the

please use the chain there's so many

things called the chain their songs and

books and TV shows just a change man the

chain spanner

what did you do over there yeah dude the

needles are awesome why do humans have

so many gods

I wonder if Ajax knows this is [ __ ]

cool yeah I like I was like yes swords

twisted it's aren't ya twisty twisty

boys mind is twisted no I should get

invincible type black cats and bow ties

[Music]

through that scar yeah I like the Elgin

there's a line art version I think like

this one too

oh that's pretty good yeah I like the

background depth of field yeah it does

oh this is on the Left we have King and

his wife ooh entourage is gone his

actual gone the background and Lydia

brass intercepting his message I think

his

and then there was slim right do we have

any well obviously we want to thank

about mods who work tirelessly in order

to keep you know having a great

community doesn't just happen all by

itself it takes a lot of people working

really hard and our mods are at the

forefront of that effort making it so

the twitch chat is reasonable and fun

and the community is dope and also often

carry pee keeps a running tab of what

has happened so far so that if you

joined late like just now for instance

hi welcome to the show my name is matt

calvo you can just type i think i

excavate there's a command i don't know

what it is exclamation point recap

probably not we're gonna guess that's me

what it is and that'll link you to a

Google Doc that isn't running kind of

what you missed Bing and also remember

that if you have Amazon Prime then you

get a free twitch Prime subscription

that you get to send to your favorite

streamer every could be anybody who

knows who knows who that favorite

screamer is could be me nice creamy oh

come on now some could be a minecraft

stream I guess that's what we do I think

that's it now we can go back to playing

oh that's right well we have we do have

a Kickstarter coming up pretty soon you

can kind of tell because I've stopped

sharing art because after the first

couple pieces art came in for the

Kickstarter I'm like I'm gonna hang onto

these and save them so there are some

surprises and the next Kickstarter I

think is gonna feature quite a lot of

art so if you want an alert when the

Kickstarter goes live there is a link

you can give us your email and we will

send you one email only we're not gonna

spam you we're not gonna sell your email

address that's ridiculous and that way

you will know when the Kickstarter goes

live anyway when last we left our

because that's it feels like that intro

was like me talking for half an hour I

know actually do it anyway you folks

just watched some evil night person come

and threaten a cop you don't like slim

like he's just doing his job

I think O'Driscoll yeah

he's a dwarf like if you've known

dwarves he's like all dwarfs except more

so oh all that all that attitude is one

under percent normal everyday too worth

yeah they're there in my campaign

dwarves or shortly anyway I know what

that is

anyway anyway sorry carry on anyway what

are we doing you should have seen after

the break everyone's looks like I was

the only person in there eating munchies

everyone else is just waiting for didi

to have it this is somewhat unusual uh

yes we saw we're at a candle shop right

you're gonna head out slim now has slim

is given pesky slim given King the

psionic crystal the medium sign have

strayed and now slim has the silver

braces of Val chief and Bacchus no Kevin

and you're headed toward the the

abandoned candle shop that you folks own

now yeah correct yeah then we can talk a

little more freely about yeah well

there's an interest to the candle shop

in an alleyway and makes it very easy to

go in and out without anybody noticing

and the candle shop is all boarded up so

you guys have spent the night in here

before and it does have a passageway

that leads during well oh so now that

King has you in private yeah he's gonna

give us a speech yeah darling I guess

silence counterspell you with the rod

that I took from you while you were

sleeping I am von glower now having golf

I made the call and lady erosive are I

wasn't okay with the idea of just

killing her she hadn't done anything

wrong I mean I didn't like her but

that's not

I have a hard time seeing the rod of

count whatever is just a tool I think

it's dangerous it's the interest to us

that disease whatever it is is dangerous

to everybody innocent people and it

should be destroyed

maybe we need things like that to fight

Ajax probably we do but if it's up to me

that's not how we do things that's not

how we win so maybe it shouldn't be up

to me the chain needs to be able to do

what's necessary forget forget what I

think and I'm not and I'm not the

commander I guess I'm not by any means

necessary so according to the bylaws of

the company I'm calling for a vote of

no-confidence according to The Chronicle

it requires a majority of the senior

officers to vote no confidence and the

commander doesn't get a vote that leaves

four senior officers which is not enough

for a quorum so leach you're promoted to

senior welcome to the command structure

of the chain so what happens in vivid IQ

surpasses command then you have another

vote for a new command okay angels in

here angels like yeah I think so what

becomes of King men in the case that is

no comment just goes back to me in the

chronicler right but only if we vote in

it no he doesn't want to do it oh yeah I

think what I said was he's incapable

mm-hm no I said I'm giving you guys a

choice I did something like let lady

Rosa Wargo instead of killing her mm-hmm

maybe I don't think that's what sweet

would have done it's not what red would

have done mm-hmm some people might feel

differently or having to deal with a lot

of problems here and as king I'm going

to make choices along with my beliefs

right yeah and if you don't like my

beliefs

now is your time to speak up but I'm not

gonna straight murder a night I'm not

gonna leave that woman in the psionic

barrier you know we've already figured

out a workaround for that yeah but for

example that plague it's if you vote if

you vote to keep me I'm destroying that

thing it's not staying well it's likely

that's that we got to do something

because that it's now even worse with

that [ __ ] death knight lady coming to

take it what's even worse the staff

situation I mean she didn't directly

talk to us she didn't really in my view

of how Matt did it this is Lars talking

now I believe she was talking to us not

necessarily the dwarf that was there she

didn't say you had it on you right she

she said she wasn't him yeah she said

you have you say zorg's I thought you

just said before I got your brain yeah

yeah she definitely said your brain yeah

too far stretch to figure out oh the

trainer background here is here oh hey

that thing just popped back into

existence at but you had it on you right

there like feet away from them okay

no and she couldn't sense I think the

point King is trying to make is that mmm

I'm not there I can't get this talk well

here's the thing they can scry it right

they know what they're looking for they

can scry that kind of item and we don't

have the magical like items on us to

prevent people from scrying us only

angel has that unless we want to take

that off him but then that leaves us

open to other kinds of issues um we

could use that blank check that you have

to get possibly more of those kinds of

items to like prevent people from

scrying our location I can describe cuz

they know what the name of it is I think

you just have to know the name of

something describe Wydell what it looks

like all that Kosta how do you think she

knows that it's back in this plane of

existence like they have a lead on the

dwarf like isn't it better off in our

hands I think so so the guess thing that

we're voting on right now is whether or

not you guys want to have me as the

commander my concern

yeah okay is this a private vote a

public vote how does this work Rick yeah

[Laughter]

so you guys basically get to vote

whether or not you think I've been

making the right calls you think I'm

gonna continue to make the right calls

but if you have an issue with me saying

we're destroying the [ __ ] plague and

I'm not your commander or the riot yeah

yeah here's I don't think the rods

well the rods not we're gonna do

something about it I think I agree yeah

I think we I think we I think I think we

need to take responsibility for the

things like this isn't gonna be the only

thing that we find down at ring well

that's like dangerous and gnarly and and

brings up you know sort of unearth these

these types of problems well that's what

I'm kind of saying like for example with

the Otto phage we can 100% take care of

that problem right now we can blast it

out of existence it can not completely

wipe out the city it's not going to be

on us that we let this thing out and

destroy the city like at least just

needs to be careful with that vial so as

I said if you're not ok with my call of

that now is your time to say not my

commander because that is my call on

that thing which is why I'm giving you

guys the opportunity I think in order

for us to be the most effective

mercenary company which is what we are

we need to be ruthless and we need to

make use of the tools at our disposal

because nobody is out there just giving

a [ __ ] to be able to fight off Ajax so

if we find stuff that's questionable

you know I don't think we can play the

goody two-shoes role here and try to

destroy it or give it to other people is

at least we understand that our motives

are for the chain and we don't we can't

trust other people's motives like they

might seem good but like we trust

ourselves to be clear at no point I've

said give it to other people just

destroy I've said that a fish needs to

go like destroyed and the road like the

rod we got to figure something else out

with we can't keep it in ring well we

can't give it to other people we can't

give it to the sapphire sky

because the [ __ ] undead people now

know that is there so that's another

problem that we got to figure out but

unless we want the entire undead

organization coming after us

you know what and okay what do we know

about this undead organization we found

the crown we thought them their leader

we know that this person for sure this

person is from house paleta I guess so I

guess it's I don't think your characters

no characters no I don't think there was

that kind that's why we know and I don't

think you and you haven't done any

research to figure it out yeah okay

like the sores didn't notice here who

she was maybe we should get Angel to

find out who she is

we've got 24 hours for this for this

whole broad of Count von glower Sorge

death night lady situation I think maybe

we should we should figure out who she

is and where she came from

no i 100% agree oh yeah that sounds like

something that commander the change

should decide that's before we that

maybe if there were chat is split on who

should the next commander be and I'm not

gonna say it's like a hawk so much like

an internal technical sword

Hey yeah okay 47 yeah would you like to

keep commander King no Dean anywhere

King is called for voting a cop so like

I said keep in mind I'm gonna destroy

the auto page if I continue being

commander I'm not what if the new

commander commands you commanded you to

kill lady or Rosa var kill lady a

reservoir mm-hmm I don't see why they

would pick me to kill lady revoir what

if the new commander commanded you to do

so

hmm that's a good question

I love one I don't have to anything yeah

cheer what I mean I stand by the chain

and the chain is my family but uh that's

kind of flat people but why would you

ask your cleric to do that your clerics

loyalty I mean I think I've already

answered that I let her go mm-hmm made

the order those is the commander though

right and I think this is in tension I'd

advise against it because I don't think

it's right William and I and quite

honestly I don't that's right for the

train because when we make a enemy of

the next largest organization in the

city or house in the city I think

especially the one that's gonna let us

cast spells keep it empty to try and

please everyone like we will keep just

cutting ourselves short of what we're

capable of doing here and like we'll

never be able to reach our goals not

once have I said should we please

everybody there's one specific thing

that I put on the table which is I'm

saying if I'm gonna keep me in the

commander I'm destroying the auto page

because I'm not okay with that getting

out in the city but the larger context

for that is that voting in favor of

keeping your current commander means

voting in favor of King leading by his

own morality that's what the auto page

is just an example yeah and there are

other examples this lady rosemary on the

count the rod of count on our own Glock

I do think we need somebody in command

who can write the line more in the

middle then where you currently stand on

most things and I think we can be more

effective as a company and help others

like so we can attain our own goals in

that way no yeah for me it's a vote for

no confidence lieutenant

although no copper no meaning not not

the commander and yes meaning you say

the commander

yeah no means no means I'm out I'm gonna

say yes part so the reason is I feel

like you're kind of like there's like

there's you if it was if that balance

was shifted to some like you you're kind

of like keeping the chain and this kind

of they may go to evil or to to uh dark

dark and you kind of have this like

balance to that stuff so I think I think

that's yes yeah yeah I mean I do need to

establish a better uh Matt and I talked

about this earlier to deal with Lady

Rose 'var I need to say oh hey there's a

pie with my name on I gotta go outside

judge you're in charge of the prisoner

right or somebody else right although I

mean she was on the same page but I'm

not you're not killing her but yeah

there could be not because if all right

or wrong but because of the potential

consequences that would come to the

chain for doing so well correct and that

weight on it as well for the final

decision right like killing a knight of

the church was one of the many reasons

why I was like okay we can kill this

problem with that like slim slim is the

new member of the chain everybody else

in the senior officer corps and even

leach least these guys have known King

for years and King has been a loyal

member of the chain and he would do what

the commander told him to you right but

the same token the commander the

hypothetical you posed is a good

question but the commander would not

have ever asked a good commander his

tools exactly so like there's a

difference between King as the

chronicler and what he and King is the

commander mm-hmm like some things like

that come across my plate and like a

violin silencer thing right

don't tell him if yeah if he's aware of

certain things and he's got to act on it

he's got to do something about it and

there's complicit so

Clemmie senior officer yeah yeah yeah

yeah when we took care of the oath I was

after we did the round job yeah Oh me

yeah I guess yeah we went random to to

uh to vote against the commander one

vote in favor well we are a mercenary

company and the survival and well-being

of our company should come before any

sentimental feelings I vote no sir

that's three against only one in favor

it turns out it doesn't matter what

leach says yep I'll abstain from voting

[Laughter]

commander it's been a pleasure to serve

Andy yeah that was kind of thrown in

your lap anyway so yeah and now it's

time to choose a new commander that's

the next phase Nadia how do we do

somebody nominate somebody and then give

up mmm you can't nominate yourself I

would be a magnificent commander that's

why I should add I should have had a UH

I should have well it's not but it's not

really up to I know I not actually

nominated boots because I think that

with us being in capital right now what

boots he spilled the beans

this creatures got diarrhea situation a

bit of tag does not unneeded and and

boots is familiar with capital it's also

one of those things where you know we

try it out for a bit see how it goes as

you can see here we can always vote no

confidence if it turns out that the

diarrhea continues look I'm not a great

politician but I do know a bit of the

ways of this place and I can be

persuasive you need be persuasive to

these people perhaps a prince we need a

face sir there's no one else gonna

nominate anyone else uh I nominate boots

are you okay he's the second the

nomination hmm I think I'm gonna vote

for slim so you can't nominate you don't

have to nominate somebody you don't have

to have no absolutely not but you're not

required to I mean anybody I know I

don't want to be that Phil doesn't

really want and really doesn't want to

be the leader but I think slim would

yeah you know you can't be forced to be

the commander if somebody nominates that

you can withdraw slim would never do

that but but it everybody loves slim

slim is a cool [ __ ] character I think

slim is dope as hell but I think it's

unreasonable you undertook this

character explicitly to get out from

like judge would tell slim like look you

I think what you are seeking him you

have a lot more effective not in the

commander role I'm new here I would like

to see what judge can do oh yeah do I

get a most

so we've got no nice to donation for

boots one for slim one for judge right

now yeah so much once once once there

are nominations oh yeah are you drooling

uh is that the contacts for the I'm new

here

look I'm not saying no now maybe no

maybe yes later right I only joined you

guys left three weeks ago exactly but

he's not stupid

I know I don't think he could expect to

command the loyalty of the company being

that he just joined well great so unless

anyone else is gonna nominate anybody

Slim has withdrawn himself from the

voting that means boots and judge

they've been nominated at that point at

that point then it's a and then all the

senior officers including King get to

vote on between boots and Judge Jack two

people have been nominated

I'm vote like judgement boots can vote

for himself I don't know what is the

Chronicle side hmm

it doesn't make sense that the people

who have been nominated we get to vote

said well would they they would just

vote for themself I would a sovereign or

for nobody right the other so they could

be or we just demote leach back and we

have three in the to tie

either way these two I'm gonna keep it

tally it's up to you guys you guys are

cool you guys are the Chronicle has

instances where they did secret ballots

there are there instances there

instances where they enfranchised junior

officers all sorts of stuff it's you

know it's it's not and we may have

there's no you guys are not a government

if it has a constitution you guys just

have traditions and the tradition of the

chain you guys have been around for over

a thousand years actually probably about

three thousand four and so all sorts of

stuff this has happened

if you guys want to a secret ballot

that's fine but it it would be dramatic

we get to do a drumroll faster way I'm

family yeah what I don't mind saying is

I don't mind secrets yeah ask the stream

what do they want secret ballot or just

call it mods what does the stream one

should the mods let's at let's put let's

ask the people right what does the

Chronicle say does the Chronicle say

that's like a lot of hey what what is

the Chronicle say does the Chronicle say

that it's a secret ballot or does the

Chronicle say that everybody has to vote

in open open openly so you know who to

hold responsible and expose how this is

gonna take this can take a few minutes

I'm not super worried about the mods

have pulled the electorate and the

electorate thinks it should be a secret

ballot judge and the judge and boots are

on their honor not to vote for

themselves well why would they if

they're on their own or not to vote for

themselves that means they vote free

they'd have to vote for the yeah that's

four of us an OD draws a picture smiley

face with horns or a little smiley face

with boots like a really accurately like

a Scottish and the ballot that some

voter wrote next to every name wanker

wanker wanker yeah and then what I wrote

not wanker or something like that and

then according to the rules that counted

yeah indicated clear preferences

drawings if it's decided that's the

wrong okay they said so I one two threes

I think that like it would be up to you

guys how you make you officers you might

just ask angel yeah you might just act

like the angel is kind of the head of

the junior officers yeah and then but

it's still gonna be up to the what do

you think what do think it's gonna be

time okay well say I'm super curious

okay okay well that's what indicates

clear preference blank is one yeah no

it's

there are three votes for judge and one

vote for boots judge you're the

commander of the chain of thus begins

the book of judge I've got a new page in

The Chronicle to riot chronically boots

maybe next time congratulate the new

commander a new fur nor would you yeah

Odie is perfectly happy to dance around

in judges shoulders oh it's back over to

you and starts whispering Yuri Scott

he's going to have you killed

judge not true just behave yourself oh

god she's lying to you

Odie quiet I'm a senior officer now [ __ ]

oh nothing I just thought of something

anyway anyway anyway unforeseen

consequences and by the way the title of

tonight's episode was no confidence that

I was thinking about calling the boat

after the Rosa war thing yeah surprise

me I had no idea that's what you're

gonna say yeah well I mean when he said

then he says blah blah no cop

confidence at first I thought as a

campaign diary folks welcome the

campaign is long as this long as the way

of saying that he's like like as a

player he's pissed at something I did

but that was like wait actually this is

super dramatic yeah [ __ ] yeah I voted no

confidence would be really and then I

actually asked him I said I talked about

him today I said wait hang on a minute

cuz I just literally sat and thought how

would this work and I said based on me

trying to figure out what it says in the

Chronicle about this process and I said

if that's how you feel I think King

would just quit I think he would be like

known as Nami and then he said no

because how I feel is like I don't know

I don't not want to be commander I just

want to make sure they understand that

if I'm commander then we do things my

way

right and that's why I think no

confidence I'm like I think you're right

I don't think that's I quit that's I

want to take a vote and then you guys

are stuck with the consequences about so

I thought that was dope anyway uh Lars

were you about to say something yeah I

was gonna see if absolutely yeah

Lars has had a family emergency yep and

so Lars will not be joining us for the

rest of those I mean this might be good

place to stop for all I know that was

incredibly dramatic although not much

happened tonight so far also wasn't

there wasn't didn't you and I talk about

something that's none of their business

oh we talked about that no no no yeah I

mean yeah they're just gonna I don't

know if there's gonna be battle tonight

or not but like you're back to being the

chronicler now so I think everybody's

own idea where your character would do

so he can trade all that Oh shoes is

good

he can't read it with that book to shoes

is your mm-hmm

retain one of your retainers okay all

right welcome welcome to command judge

[Music]

[Laughter]

yeah George I don't believe I've ever

seen judge this giddy yeah pretty so

great now yes she does she tells you

rather happy sir I am myself perhaps

you'll stop putting things on me when I

see through Odie's eyes it'll be a hard

habit to kick I think sir

well we just had a very dramatic and

let's cry before the character is there

someone tense moment yeah but now you're

still the candle shop okay yeah judge

what are your orders I think we should

still release the woman from the yeah

you believe that you believe that that

this is something was disguised as

ladies when I took the ring off she

wasn't that high impact and she says she

can open the gold door wear a black eye

impact went through right Shay said she

knows how the door can be opened can't

be undone she's a sociopath that's more

than we'd know what a band we've we've

we've been to everywhere else on this

the first right yes the only thing we've

not done is the cord RIA but actually OD

when you went to go to the ER when I

sent you to touch the did you see what

eyes and teeth you were terrified OD mmm

doesn't sound to account like it don't

like it no I won't send you again there

perhaps so yeah we haven't done we yeah

there's yeah there still is the thing

what did I suppose this is a question

for for King who's still here

yes right yes what did the Sapphire sky

tell you about the cauldron I talked I

talked to Marcela Scipio he didn't know

he'd never heard him but he wrote it

down and said they were gonna look into

it he said it's exactly the kind of

thing that we can rely on them for okay

yeah he's a lor

he said lor removing curses is right up

their alley bringing them innocent

Knights two killed none mm-hmm I see

there's a way to contain this thing and

King tootin I think we should wait for

ourselves to do his job to do the work

right and come back it's considering how

quickly he got Boots's I'm sorry slim

sprays house has I think I think we're I

think we're looking at hours or a day

yeah and then we'll know something more

about this and until that maybe it'd be

a good idea to leave it alone and then

we keep talking about killing the was it

cool um the auto-hide right I thought

it's all it's all dead apart from the

one you have yeah yes I mean why did

that one live didn't I add this design a

tie to in me didn't I yeah when I took

one out I took a live one actually what

what it did when you put it in the file

is it with it like withered and it

looked like it's dying but then but

there is still this kind of floating

moat in there stasis that is that was

what you saw when you open the door

all right this kind of cloud motes came

out and those motes turned into the

worms your father no weapon of mass

destruction I see yeah if we ever needed

yeah essentially I do wonder if we

should have somebody do some research

it's not most effectively no I mean for

instance a fire Skye's familiar with

this kind of thing

they might not be a bad person too bad

group to go to to investigate it a

little bit further as long as they can

ensure that it's not destroyed I think

that's dangerous keep talking okay I

think the more I think I think they I

think the more we tell the Sapphire sky

about the Otto phage than the fewer

choices I see no reason to trust them

either in any other situation they just

as likely be our enemy is our ally

that's true let me [ __ ] should have it

put it somewhere site for life it's just

all me in a vow not [ __ ] alright trip

and fall the last emperor thought the

only safe place is inside ring well we

just keep it there for now

well other people are coming through

ringing yeah yeah no I'll do it for you

yeah alright we can put it in the in the

holding something like a hard shell like

I'm sure enough something is yeah yes

King that's that's better than just he's

got the back only right I'd rather be in

the bag holding than on a check sure

okay is there any other things in the

bag of holding that King was holding on

to that he was reluctant to let us have

hold of Matt doesn't know yeah company

well then there was the rock right no

yeah it was just the rug really Rudd was

the main one was like you gotta give it

to me I think there was something in

there before but then I think I might

have in the crystal and then you just

been you dispensed it you'd old it out

yeah I think there was something that

he's like gonna hang on to this but then

I think yes I think you used it I don't

know okay okay well I think at this

point in go ahead actually I'm gonna

call is angel still around somewhere

where I can calm I'm back in I can I can

get him okay yeah cuz I want to make

sure that this information is the

information of the angel we need you

King know he's gonna put Santa pouch

yeah also was something that the

commander should have

Lars isn't here so we defer that me with

for now that I do want angel to work

under boots moving forward instead of

king first by master things um yeah cuz

I basically whenever angel gets here I

just when I tell them about the change

in command and to relay that to the rest

of the yeah okay why angel shows up

anyway how'd it go

he says he's actually smoking and I'm

commander and she didn't tell angel to

tell everybody the we promoted leach but

you didn't

probably angel yeah that that's probably

more surprising than anything else

angel is here when angel was in the room

when king gave a speech yeah so the

promotion he saw and then he was like I

think I better go

he's most surprised about angel seen

angels in the chamber while he's seen

multiple commanders and he probably has

some private thoughts about whether or

not King was gonna last you know at

least he broke the curse the this

commander that's true well we'll see

yeah and by the way it's not a younger

it's historically almost every time the

commander has called for a vote of

no-confidence like this the

the senior officer was support in Libya

mess up no no the guy it's usually when

somebody else calls for vote is our

confidence it so well I mean typically I

think the commander accorded the lesson

of the chain Chronicle lesson old

Chronicle is the commander who's like I

don't know if I'm the right guy that's

typically the guy you want yeah but

assistants are reluctant yeah exactly

but in this instance yes anyway so the

problem perhaps they couldn't read you

do these right yes yes for King but but

then this this is that's my boat this is

coppers book like I said it indicated

clear prevail okay okay let's let's go

down into the caves we'll go down into

the chamber with plenty on it and we

will use the prismatic shard crystal to

weaken to do it whatever he's doing um I

would think familiar well yeah he's used

it before you're familiar with like kind

of the work that's needed and also he's

already has psionic abilities anyways so

you can just channel it further as far

as I'm concerned but I don't really know

what I'm supposed to be doing mmm like

it seemed like whenever the dark I think

you don't but I think slim would yeah

okay like what the gem gives you is it

gives you psionic charges they're

actually in setting they're called

charges and that lets you manifest

psionic abilities and all you need to do

in order to get through this recording

to the experiments you've done is just

burn through all the charges and it'll

drop it'll drop a lot how long I've

dropped the waffle you know but it's

almost like a unique manifestation costs

12 charges right result causes this cage

to go away right okay okay

what some I would do it lady villagers

dance up when you walk that we're taking

like some precautions because she's

really lied about who she is um we don't

know who she really is or who she works

for

and we can't cast any magic which one

this one right here

Oh neither can she know to exit she can

take and run too well that says what

exit or something just in case yeah yeah

yeah Oh copper and aisle will be will be

in the doorway okay okay

and then slim you're the only one who

can use any kind of psionic abilities

while you're in here so uh can you run

me what you can do with your psionic

abilities without the crystal um I can

move things around

hmm I can what'd he say it

I knew misty step okay and translocate

is usually the word yeah and he can what

was the third thing you're the strongest

he can jump he can do bike deed do the

jump spell okay essentially so and I

that is no doubt the most attractive fan

art of judge I've ever seen these things

in there yes because there they

recycling all your psionic abilities

work in here nah but they what you

noticed was we tried to just step into

it it's like it's your you're the god

blind does not affect Sonics but the

prismatic wall still does its job

there's nothing can get in there right

yeah I mean sense okay so yeah we're

gonna rely on you slim that if she tries

to make a break for it or pull anything

funny um I want you either restrain her

incapacitate her but don't kill her

cuz we still want to try and get some

information out of her before we see

what happens next

so we want to get her out get

information okay make sure she doesn't

leave okay mm-hmm all right very well

okay so going yeah so he's gonna have a

prismatic crystal and we'll go up to it

and

which we can you explain about what

we're gonna do right yeah but to get her

out she doesn't know when well yeah she

needs to know we're gonna get it yeah

it's happening yeah not are we gonna be

a bit weird about it I thought we're

here to get you out yeah like we just

wanna get some information but you're

saying that she was she stands up and

every coming be prepared to move out of

the circle I don't know how long it'll

she stands up that's the chain of a

crunch because she's just kind of

sitting maybe dozing lightly with her

back against the okay yeah Walter nope

no water two days without water she

seems fine yep two days that was pushing

out there right well for human sorry all

right yeah at that point yeah it's tough

she stands up and as the chain as the

senior officer corner of the chain of

background enter led by judge she stands

up and goes ah I wondered when this

would happen well what can I do for you

commander so we think we have a way out

for you we have a prismatic shard ah

it's full excellent and we think that we

can use this to break open the barrier

but we'll need you to get out quickly I

must say she says when she puts her hand

against the wall you're quite the most

resourceful organization I've ever

encountered yeah we try um so I believe

the agreement was that upon your

really--it's will have an opportunity to

talk about where you're from and how to

get through the door how do you get

through the door I remember us talking

about but I I don't remember telling you

to I would divulge where I'm from you

did say bigger to help you in exchange

for getting out of this cage yes seems

very inconvenient

you did mention that it could be

beneficial to both of our organizations

yes so yeah hurry now or I think what

she said was we have all the same

enemies oh yeah okay all right we're

gonna try and do this now and see how it

goes all right so I guess one will do

his thing but before he starts he's just

gonna if you betray us

I got you I believe you would do you

have the stats for the crystal like do

you have a card or anything I have it

all written in mind

slim you've seen slim do this before

this is he activates the crystal the

crystal glows and his sword is wreathed

in in psionic energy looks like the

Bifrost basically in his hand but this

uses all 12 of the charges so the

crystal glows quite a bit more brightly

and as it does as it glows as as the

globe Rises the barrier goes and the

barrier comes down and Lady of the

Olympia smiles and then the barrier is

gone and the crystal which is always

glowing a little like if you look at the

picture it is a it is itself illuminated

mmm the crystal goes dead and now just a

shot of white quartz and Lady Vol entia

steps out from where the circle was and

you see almost like somebody lighting a

fuse this caps as this energy goes

through the circular reward that was and

has always been in here and then once

it's done it it glows for a second and

then becomes dull and now you almost

can't even see that there's a ward here

it's just it's just more of the stones

it's all you sense itself more of the

stone that's all we should go again oh

maybe or maybe it's just gone so I walk

into

[Laughter]

lady Violetta boughs and says I'm in

your debt now what did we talk about can

I keep the inert stone yeah I mean there

might be there might be a way to

rejuvenate it I'm sure that lore exists

first of all what's all take water skin

out of my pack and offer it oh I think

the Sharad of me being more human is is

no longer necessary to maintain

obviously I am NOT as I seem what what

can I do for you yeah obviously know

your true self well that's important but

not as important as what we are down

here to do which is to get the words how

do you get through the door without a

wish there the Emperor made keys and he

gave a key to each of the Lords of the

Great Houses never seen this was 1500

years ago yeah and houses have changed

in that time and it's is 59 years agos

before even even my memory but I believe

that there is still a key in the

possession of house Valletta house

evarro house Navarre and house Verona

almost certainly they do not know what

they have and it would be locked away in

their manor house inside some vault of

curios very easy to sneak in and steal

if you happen to be one of the greatest

thieves in the world do you think you'd

all look the same

yes form follows function do you know

what they look like just as well let us

follow me are you one of the greatest

thieves in the world modesty prevents me

from saying better to say that I am the

cause of thievery in others

and she's gonna leave she's gonna walk

she's gonna follow like following her

because she's gonna show something right

she takes you to the door and she says

there's their brass and their

cylindrical and they look like there was

a fashion some hundreds of years ago for

musical boxes mostly small some large

wound up they would spin away and play

lovely little tunes you might buy as a

curio for your daughter

these appear the keys appear to be large

scale versions of that and they fit and

she points into them into this hole

mm-hmm and the seal and she puts her

hands up the seal is a magical ward but

the key will turn it off the key doesn't

open the door once the seal is off

anybody can open the door the key turns

off the seal I think he's magical I

don't know so wait one / - it only takes

one key you don't have to combine them

or anything and you use the key and it

turns the ward off correct you go you

can go through the dome that anyone can

go through the door once the ward is

down well it's off so it doesn't even

mean so it doesn't reset itself the way

that thing just I don't know hmm I've

already guess I would say no it wouldn't

reset but it might so once you open it

yeah just open go go go Pandora's box

yeah so all you have to do is decide

whose house to burgle so it's just one

key is needed and this is the only other

door it's just four keys only ones

needed and they they're all they're all

the same like they'll all fit inside

this door like there's not like three

more doors past this one there are more

doors but the same key opens I think yes

but here we are at the limits of my

knowledge so what happens to you now you

go back to the black iron pact to rejoin

the ring

as an infiltrator or do you join the

chain of Acheron that's the cooler age

of glory join us I knew judges the

commandership for me it's back to

business uh my relationship for the

black iron pact is probably at an end

hang on a second they read something I'm

kind of with you though I scared to

Julia and she said she's the cause of

all things so she can [ __ ] sleep yeah

we haven't got one last Buerkle lose it

well greed quick money the head thief

yeah well then if it means she gets

things that people want us I don't know

they forget it Julia even bad uh anyway

yes she says odd for me it's back to

business I think my relationship with

the black iron pact is over but I

suspect yours is not I will give you one

more piece of advice which you have not

asked for call it out of the goodness of

my what do you call those things hearts

stomach oh the black iron pact operate

this will not surprise you out of their

own manifold the entrance to which can

be accessed by using one of their rings

oh dude this is oh this is good yeah

this is real good be careful thank you

for that nice how are you able to wear

one but it not oh this is just a black

middle ring delightful yes I'm still

curious you new say you're the cause of

all thieves Wow how do you how do you

access the manifold

let's it rings

mmm that's what a man that's what she

means by madam yes first time we were

fighting them they came in out of like

nowhere I think they're like we hear

their voices really showed up I think

that's what right Scipio does never he's

trying to take us everybody I think so

yeah I mean it was a capital seems to be

a nexus for these kind of it's there's

some certain she would have how to use

it some way to get to wherever the black

hat is I don't Matt Matt doesn't know

Matt's gonna get back to you okay III

I'm pretty sure I wrote this down

somewhere but I don't remember what I

wrote and I want to trust earlier Matt

before I throw them under the bus but I

think you might have to do something

besides just put it on I think you might

actually have to like swear an oath or

something I think you might have to like

quote-unquote attuned to it okay like I

do the devil's work I think there's a

component like that and lady Valentino's

and she'll tell you okay Matt doesn't

right that's fine that's fine as long as

she tells us well as long as you're not

planning on putting on the ring now then

I don't have to know we're in it but you

guys had at least one that's right and

also an angel like angels god I swear to

God I know the answer to this ejecta

wankers unite it might just be you put

it on it might just be put it on and you

can you go to Rack Minar which is the

name of their their pocket world I'm

gonna bang on about it again come on why

why you know what why it of cause among

thieves well now now meet bleach between

professionals I would never ask you what

causes you to join the chain of acheron

let's keep things professional and not

get personal okay so how can you help

yeah when you say you said an easy job

for the world's best the hair were you

volunteering are you saying the chain of

Akron isn't up to the job I'm not a

thief yeah doing yeah

about you employ some quite good thieves

okay quite good thieves

most people spend their entire lives

trying to avoid doing business with me

in my organization let's say should you

try and fail talk to me

[Music]

actually I think she does have a

diplomat's pouch yeah

so then we'll need a name a lady of

Allante will do it works some 90 year

old woman named lady Valencia gets a

message sends her a dick pic me there is

normally uh a war of succession when the

head of our organization is indisposed

so I would like to go back now and stop

that from happening

well I'm curious to see who's taken over

my absence how about it

wonder if she's one of those like

clockwork thingies whatever um thank you

for your assistance huh and for the

Intel as well it's very good luck

commander and she takes off all right so

so we know that we want to like get

through to anything else well I didn't

kiss him I would like very much like to

own one of these music box things that

she described yaps your friend with the

blank check can get us one yeah yeah I

I'm thinking the same thing I don't know

how we play it exactly but he certainly

wants to get within our good graces the

only the only thing is I don't know how

we

yes you might been about to say this

King Kings legs because the trick is how

do we ask him for it without telling him

what it is yeah exactly he'll want to

know my personhood and I personally

think it would be a bad idea to let any

what do you know what these things are

you're even letting them know that we

want it gives them information that we

might want to avoid I think maybe we

just say didn't send in a thief yeah we

have a thief who's our thief angel angel

angel organization assassin yeah he

would be he would he would consider rude

if you called him a thief oh you'd be

like but he's headed a spy but but the

practical difference between what he

does and what you want him to do is now

you know there you know would be cool

like if you guys get to a point where

you're like yes

we want one of these keys this is

actually what the Sapphire sky is

talking to us for because they would

never schoo steal this thing will

[ __ ] do it

and you guys decide who you're gonna go

rob because you have a little menu of

choices it might be cool if it were like

us angel and like a strike team of his

saying we'll take it maybe it's not this

will be up to you guys maybe it's not

your characters huh or maybe it's some

combination of your characters depending

on if you're like yeah I'm up for it I'm

a stealthy yeah you know yeah maybe that

would be you know be kind of cool make

junior officers of the chain who are

spies they use I mean what they're like

getting the crew together if we did that

it might be the kind of thing where

maybe some of you guys aren't members of

the chain or a croc maybe angel recruits

yeah maybe angels like this is somebody

your character is somebody that I as the

head of the spy network have been

dealing with hey we want your help

how about you join the chat yeah like

that lady the lady who showed up that's

right oh yeah it's a good was like she

was Andrea yeah yeah yeah yeah baby said

yeah yeah Orlando yeah I wrote a whole

thing for her so what did she do she's

one of angels recruits

oh right yeah good comeback she's like a

bird she's like a thief in the city I

think herself

anyway well we commander we do on one of

these key absolutely yeah how would then

they go was all talk to Angel I'll get

the which house do we think would be

easier to infiltrate houses king there

which house do we want to upset right

let's assume that gonna find out about

this hopefully after the fact which

houses the common house he named all

later correct and the know we'll have

all the great houses the same she

implied that there may because this

happened fifteen hundred years ago the

Emperor may have given keys to people

who were the heads of great houses then

that have since collapsed but if so she

doesn't know she'd have to you guys

would have to do research library oh the

library might survive you might be able

go to library to find out cool cool yeah

like that's kind of classic Rio and

skullduggery is we need to figure out

who was in charge of the city fifteen

hundred years ago because even though

this person is now a cheesemaker

somewhere somewhere in the closet like

heirloom chess but there's no way to

avoid playing D&D there's no matter who

it ends up being well they're still

gonna be a mission to get this no I know

I'm in order to go to the library though

we need to be able to we can kind of

yeah

Paula took our way through yeah thank

you maybe that's something you can ask

your buddy for yeah yeah I think so

there's another issue King says we I

don't know if this is something that you

care about commander but George has now

something less than 24 hours are we okay

with God about George with the captain

of the local constabulary getting his

brain burned out on our count well I

mean if he's off its off if he's off our

since I know you didn't ask me but I

mean since I've got this since I've got

this infernal thing I

I mean I've I see I see no point in

letting this guy get senselessly brain

burned especially because that just

means that this death Knights gonna come

after me next maybe in some capacity

well she didn't know you had yeah but

she was gonna melt this guy's brain and

then just go home and forget about it no

no they're gonna keep looking

yeah they're gonna find it eventually we

could probably the first time you use it

we could assault the ambush is what I'm

that's what I'm saying

assault the ambush as far as taking on

that night I came into the nice pretty

nice taking on leading into a war that

would trap her there forever I don't

know what that word is there I've got

these boots that's pretty pretty quick

from whenever that I've got the road

whatever the thing came down and then

the seal like disappeared the judge

could be like was the impression that

the ward is just gone now like that that

trigger is now gone

or camo check okay you can I Drive -

sure no yeah again anybody cab you go

people here as I said like that was cuz

it's a judge as the one that's wandering

okay anybody can anybody can know this

okay three yeah it's wizard nonsense oh

you don't know you do not want a wizard

nonsense mama girl yeah I'm like I could

just ask you could just go big boy so

what are you thinking commander I don't

think the word went away but I want to

know what you think you're the one who

touched seventeen it has all the

hallmarks of classically recharging okay

I remember that when lady violento went

in when she ran in there if she did not

know there was a warden there cuz she

couldn't see there was anything on the

ground so the here's to have gone back

to the state it was in when she ran into

another so do you

like do you want a bit like the rod in

the middle like something a mousetrap

situation had not

oh yeah but with trapper but yeah boots

beam you almost the other side right

here it is come and get it and then she

runs it

yeah and that's you've got your fancy

speedy boots mm-hmm she named George and

told him his life was on the line to get

this if we do what you're saying that

means he's in our debt yeah and I think

we could it use having the princess

soldiers in our debt yep maybe already

in our debt though now he was being in

what I'll he was Benedict Ragan things

that just mean that was the red Falcon

yeah that just means we have the same

authorities the same authority they have

but wouldn't it be nice if we could sort

of unify all the princes soldiers on the

on the pin the city I like it yeah we we

did a favor for the red Falcons if we do

a favor for these guys that's that's to

do another favor for the red pelicans by

the way so dragon yeah we're gonna to

break that siege to get in there and do

and the research to get there but to

Loki's time-sensitive right yeah so I

don't know how long's passed but also

the benefit of that is that is that we

know we know essentially when when this

night is coming back yes whose idea was

it to lure the ladies organ I mean that

guy has to have a birthday right just so

it's 10:05 which is normally when we

stop okay and I'm a little worried that

it's gonna be 7 o'clock next Wednesday

and I'm still gonna have no idea what

the hell's gonna happen next and so I

may be pestering you for maybe we'll

have a lunch a Dini lunch or something

I'm gonna be pestering you folks to come

up with come up with something that I

can prep that counts as content and so

yeah super keen super looking forward to

the campaign diary it is 10:05 I think

we had a great night there were no there

was no battle there was

combat but we got through pretty much

everything I thought my notes which were

up on patreon I will just release for

everybody and I will see you folks in

seven days see you next Wednesday to

rock and roll

[Music]
