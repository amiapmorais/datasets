everybody may I call Billy here welcome

to the show these are my friends we play

Dungeons & Dragons on some Wednesday

nights like tonight right before we get

started some announcements those of you

who've been paying attention know that

I've been threatening to take a break

for a while take like three months off

for a lot of reasons partially because

we've got this Kickstarter coming up

that we're intending on launching soon

and I guess that break is kind of

already happening because we got the

heist died and still not ready for

that'll probably a couple of weeks I

don't know if we gonna play next week I

don't know he'll be ready so once the

highest is done and we played through it

so we may play next week we may not and

then hopefully we will get to the

highest and get through without a Poe

take a couple of weeks and then there's

probably one or two sessions after that

and then we'll be done so we're kind of

in this in-between twilight state of not

actually playing every week before

officially going on break so I don't

know what the future holds we're sort of

we've got a lot of stuff going on here

including the players guide to capital

that we're working on and the

Kickstarter that we're planning on

launching quite soon actually and

there's a bunch of dope art I cannot

wait to show off for you folks if you do

are not signed up and you are afraid of

missing it so there's a link you can

click on give us your email and I'm

gonna alert when the Kickstarter goes

live and so I need to focus on that

stuff and sort of work on this stuff why

I have time people have been sending us

dope [ __ ] including well let's start

with this somebody's watched my video on

l5 R and sent me one of the classic l5

Archer this the mantis clan shirts which

references the son of storms which is

this guy so this probably doesn't mean

anything to most of you yeah so who are

whoever sent this is super cool thank

you very much and we also all got new

boxes from reckless Robbie

you know what I mean his website is

dragon at heart calm normally promote

stuff here but I just might like this

guy's stuff this is super cool so it's a

pray that you get character I saw it's

all done in wood it's a yeah it's laser

etched it's hinged and you put dice in

it he just sends us these stuff he puts

a lot of work into it and we had the

kind of the generation 1 versions and he

has sent us the generation 2 ones which

white knight said these really cool

joins in here that have been sanded and

yeah that's just as super super cool

yeah nice craftsmanship here it's pretty

hell yeah so thank you very much Robbie

and you want a dope-ass I have no idea

how much these cost

so I you're interested in this kind of

thing hi the hints to dragon at heart

calm I'm looking forward to Phil running

a vallen guard again so I look at that

look how cool that is like the negative

space since this is great Roby

this is a this is equal one here percent

genuine authentic reaction well you were

last time you played you were made

senior officer and you've got down on

strikes so now it's ready [ __ ] you

that's it I'll bite it 1951 big day like

this so yeah

yes arcane gear Smith hey Michael Miller

sent us said said me this [ __ ] thing

this is crazy it is a it's got a like

leather band around it and I think I'm

gonna use it too

it is a DM screen and this is the

outside of it so at Thung it unfolds oh

yeah yeah no we just need we just we're

just gonna need a bigger table yeah just

gonna need a bigger table it's all cross

fingers and let's see yeah he also sent

these are these initiative trackers

because there's this groove that is cut

into the top of this where you can take

these things so you can I think you can

actually I think you can draw on you can

mark on them I thought yeah yeah I

believe these are lexan doodads these

are what he called these are if these

peel off there's a protective I think

there's a certain minimum strain

separate oh yeah yeah and then I believe

you can just get like a dry erase marker

so very much there was an extra thing in

mine by the way it says don't open this

until Matt opens his I don't know what

it is oh it could be a valid guard

really anything more I'll find out

cool oh it's the balance of I believe

they're losing man just to come in there

so they don't fall otherwise they don't

fall through well I can put them however

I want the other side Reagan's asking

what's on the other side of the screen

the other side screen is blank it's just

blank wood so that I can put in my own

whatever whatever in fact this would

probably be a good way for us to test

the forthcoming VM screen that we're

intending on producing no spoilers there

as one of the stretch goals petition

that will have strongholds and followers

and kingdoms and warfare info on the

other side and a useful stuff for

Dungeon Master's when last we left our

hero anything else anything else we

talked about mods yes so we are opening

up today applications for our third

round of moderators absolutely you

cannot that's to be open for three weeks

and so before because we're gonna have

some of our old moderators stay on to

teach new moderators and then just have

like a big happy moderator family so I

believe there's a command for that

called exclamation mark apply to mod and

that will have a link to the Google Form

in it so you can by the end yeah we try

to uh Matt can you get the Balon guard

thingy from Phil to show the audience

rocket coaster yeah for drinks yeah and

they're there they're on one side

they're flat and they have the Valentine

symbol and on the other side there's

like grooves and stuff in them yeah he

said he said they were coasters because

you know I guess since it's my world you

know you thought it'd be cool if I had

some little I think that was that was

from Robbie

robee as well that's what the other guy

who made rapist Rovi yeah so thanks

Italy yeah so when last we left our

heroes the chain of Akron were planning

they were debating on whose house to rob

because they have been informed by

someone masquerading as lady Valencia

that each of the great houses of capital

have one of the keys to ring well and

they probably don't know that they have

it because it's not a it's not a magical

powerful artifact it would just be a

family heirloom

so it might be possible even reasonable

to steal it however they have not

decided which house to rob yes and in

the meantime they have to deal with the

fact that Dutchess of Valletta sent

ladies organ to get the rod of count

Road or von glower which she doesn't

know who has but she knows it's around

here somewhere and so she knows it has

been it has emerged from wherever it was

hiding obscurity ring well and it's now

on the map and it's somewhere in this

district and so they went to the

administrator of the district zeorge the

captain of the word the princess guard

here in Collins Hill and said oh they

didn't think he had it but she told him

to go find it and give to me or I will

burn out your brain you have 24 hours

and meanwhile uh the heroes have a

letter that they were given a letter of

introduction that they were given from

ladyasher Oh may the head of the fulcrum

one of the Great Houses in capital as a

way of getting in touch with and meeting

Duke Marko Verona the head of house

Verona the Navy that has sort of been

helping the heroes out thus far in the

adventure without ever having any kind

of formal relationship with that

sandwich no I love science movies new

stuff actually yeah all they can see

they can't see the actual before those

number except to knock that wall down

and push the camera your mom's

come on that's true I'll take a picture

Colchester colleges fence might be it's

green um live action there it is

beautiful yeah so where are you guys

right now like physically in the world

are you guys are you guys at the dancing

minstrel I have no idea we're about to

go down and talk to what's-her-face oh

that's right that's right well last we

left our heroes you were here as

levering well oh yeah no we're strolling

there no no no you left just like people

you need the key to go any further all

right well my aim is true this time that

go beyond the here at you right so we

have no idea where the heroes are yes

yeah I think that was our plan yes we

have all right deliver the letter first

because I figured that won't take very

long and then we'll deal with the sword

thing but doing a halfling that you

recognize comes into the dancing

minstrel before you before you set off

for house no it's not angel he's

carrying a notebook I'm just a spin

through his it is Winchester spendthrift

a the lieutenant of the word of the

assembled heroes who who is who would be

the most likely person for somebody like

a police officer to talk to like which

of you is sitting in the table and is uh

not up in their room and is not ordering

a drink yeah I'm certain the most ryokan

looking that's true

spendthrift pads over to your table and

hops up on a chair and he has his he has

his notebook and he closes his notebook

and puts it down and puts the pencil on

it he says hello greetings my commanding

officer is convinced that you and your

people

have whatever it is this debt night once

I'm sure you're obligated to pretend

that you have no idea what she is

talking about we respect that maybe if

you didn't carry those seals maybe if if

she had asked nicely but now I know my

man he won't give her anything he'll act

like he has no idea who you are and no

idea where it is just to spite her well

I've given some thought to your

commanders words as well and I I've come

to I agree I think he's I think he's

right if we're gonna we're gonna stomp

around in Princes territories carrying

the princess seals then we need to put

in the work of the princess men so we're

going to you know before 24 hours time

from our last visit of the sweet lady

night we'll be back here to make sure

that no harm befall is your commander

he's super relieved he's like to tell

you the truth I had a whole whole spiel

I'm so glad I'm so glad we see eye to

eye on this because I'm really not I

mean to be honest with you I'm I'm the

second in command if something happens

to George then I would have to take over

and that's not something I'm

particularly equipped to do I'm happy

taking notes and reminding my commander

of law and so I'd like it if you stayed

alive for another 30 40 years what is it

exactly you were planning on doing just

just murdering the death knight well

hopefully it doesn't come to a fight but

you know that's certainly something that

we are prepared to do as you know if

that turns out to be an inevitability I

mean I don't know I haven't gotten it

very much of a good impression of what

lady the letters all about but

you know not that I have a terribly high

opinion if Rioja novels to begin with

but the fact that one of them thinks

that they can just send an errand girl

to come and murder murder people in

neutral territories just to take what

they want it's certainly unusual I've

never seen anything like it in my tenure

here with the word I think I think it's

a sign of the coming conflict yeah well

I don't appreciate this behavior so

we're gonna we're gonna stand by well if

you stand by your man if you we've set

your men if you guys remember that you

got they you were confronted saying hey

if you're gonna set up shop here in this

bar in the city then you actually have

to do the job and that's eels require

you to do which is be cops and leach was

like well you you arrested some of our

guys for drunken surly behavior why

don't you just need to deputize them and

so he says we've we're in the process of

clearing out and renovating the old

courthouse here in the process the

process is the neighborhood you guys are

in so I think in order to try to keep

any conflict away from civilians that

would be a good place to me so if there

was at a cool house in the in the corner

yeah it's an old abandoned Caelian

structure that used to be a vital part

of the say but no one's used in a while

and so with the added manpower that if

you have agreed to second to us we can

use it right now there's nobody there so

if there's gonna be a fight I think

that's the best place I think that's uh

I mean it's uh let's let's plan for the

worst as they say I'm glad we see eye to

eye it's uh it's it's actually quite

refreshing to be able to have a normal

conversation with somebody thank you

[Laughter]

is there uh no I wonder if you think it

might be a good idea to have some extra

muscle waiting in the courthouse not

even necessarily as like a an ambush but

just is it like a show of force if she

comes back she'll seize you know the six

of us a giant cat and a small army of

the you know city guard it might be

enough to just like you're suggesting a

[ __ ] in her fell undead Powers summon

some kind of undead army and that we

would need a similar force to a poser I

hadn't considered in just in case

Wow it's certainly if I bring the

subject up to zeorge

he would mobilize all of the soul all of

the officers soldiers all the officers

here I'm I'm somewhat loath to risk

their lives if that's at all if it's all

possible to avoid that my commanding

officer views the enforcement of law is

something of a dwarven epoch to be

drenched in blood rather we all get home

at the end of the day and go back to our

families yeah well what about your men I

think we kind of hope for a happy medium

if if ladies organ manifests some kind

of army of the undead is there anything

the chain can do well I mean I don't

know if this is a ton of consolation but

we've been in we've been in some sticky

wickets before and managed to make our

way out especially with with regards to

undead I think between King and myself

it could be considered a bit of a

specialty but uh hopefully it won't come

to that I think if we can if we might be

a little Ike show up with enough flexing

enough muscle you know if she's

outnumbered enough then she might just

not even

you know we might be able to get her to

see reason it's a gamble but we'd have

to be able to show our cards if she

calls our bluff yeah well you're the

experts

he's content to go back to work

basically yeah I don't know what ladies

organ is capable of well neither does he

but it wasn't until you said show of

force that he started imagining what if

she kind of goes bro up and suddenly

there's a do that I think death Knights

can do that summon more well I guess

look at it this way if if she can do

that in the courthouse she could do it

in the street she could just do it

wherever right let's turn oh yeah your

your odds are better if if we're there

and if you've got a good fighting force

let's try to contain it

this is gonna be a long day I'll be at

the courthouse all right it was a

socially speaking with you

I need tops off the table walks away

well how long do we have between having

to go when did this happen

ladies organize uh so ladies or didn't

confirm yeah ladies organ confronted

George the commander of the word the

princes there they're in this

neighborhood they're like the red

Falcons yeah yeah that was this morning

so this has within like like 20 or 30

minutes okay

I actually don't the only thing that we

have done since then is roll up

characters for the sidequest yeah but

actually time in the game not much as

Bastien it so obviously the lieutenant

waited for his boss to kind of you know

stomp off to work and then he came over

here to have a word with you folks after

the fact

all right then should we head off to

yeah what we talked about towards Odie

now right we don't think Batiatus says

what he told his OD we don't think it's

good to make Odie invisible in there we

think he'll probably they'll just see

through it

I mean it's an imp right so he's up to

so they do catch and that's if that's

who you want to rob all right Wow yeah

boy just have a butcher's but just hook

look we have size so I just translate so

I want to look around right I think that

context and what you're asking this is

part of an earlier conversation how like

how like how sprout has one of these

keys to interview yeah but you have no

idea where a great house would keep a

kiss is so casing house Verona even if

you don't rob them it might help when

you're trying to figure out where is the

one of these here bingo that's what I

maybe said what he said so yeah well

I'll just have him I'll have him

invisible and other I'll brief him on

his duties when we get to this house so

D me to scout around I know go steal

back don't steal don't touch just gather

information look with your eyes not your

hands yes you can I hope you're ready to

get a booed way a bead from the Cave of

Wonders all right so he's briefed

behave yourself Odie all right so you

guys are gonna head off to the estate of

House of Rona something I didn't deliver

the letter yeah how far is it it is you

guys are in the the district you were in

is adjacent to the wife you have your

map I can show you that you know that

district that you were in is adjacent to

a district that has grown up it's close

jános next because actually you are on

the way there when you guys were kind of

interrupted we got sidetracked yeah too

heavily so it's easy to it's easy to get

there it's maybe like there's maybe four

or five neighborhoods between here and

there but is an adjacent district

and it is a it is a noble district it's

one of the nicer districts in the city

it is nowhere near as nice as where you

met Lord Latimer or where you went and

hung out with Marcellus Scipio for a

little while

that's like then probably I think the

nicest district in the city the

wealthiest most upper-class district

city house Bironas district is still

quite wealthy but it has some

middle-class neighborhoods in it and

that's what you guys are traveling

through on the way to the headquarters

of house borough know which is a massive

estate it's like shine it's like a

university right it's got brick like red

brick walls that are quite high there

are guards there are gates there are

watchtowers and there are it's not clear

if they're ceremonial or if they're

functional there are canons that align

first time you've seen apart from the

HRP broadsword the ship that inspect you

on the way and this is the first time

you've seen any kind of gunpowder weapon

abel motive thing yeah well but it's the

crap it is it is this is they run the

Navy and so it could be that these are

decorative or this could be a fortress

that is defended by cannon it's not easy

to tell by the volley and bunda yeah

let's see this is the state is called

catch trees square and it's and that

it's a large multi building complex and

even to get in I'm just trying to look

into minutes even to get in you have to

agree gates presenting the invitation

like and there's a constant pass of

people going through these gates it's

kind of like if you imagine somebody

going on to a movie studio a lot right

there's a guard that's gonna stop you

and gonna ask you are you on the list

right and so there's even as you're

approaching you see a straggle of people

going backward and forward it's not like

a line you don't really wait but the

guards seem to know most of the people

coming in and just kind of nod as they

go in and the guards are carrying

muskets so this is another this is

another instance of House of Verona has

a monopoly on the use of gunpowder and

so when you present the letter that gets

you in you are escorted a marine guard

will escort you to a place called

Trident house which is squats like a

three-story square building and you are

traveling through a very pleasant like

Google campus or University campus and

there are people who work here there are

several different buildings

the Trident House is a military

operations building the Marines refer to

his operations and there's a sign over

the door that's got an elaborate trident

symbol on it the Admiralty building

known as the Trident House you can see a

what looks like a castle on a hill

constrained by these walls so this is

you know it's the size of almost almost

a small town and there's a hill grassy

knoll and on it is a castle and that's

the castle of House bronan so this was

where the Lord of house pronouns family

probably live and it has its own gates

and stuff but you guys are going to the

Admiralty building and the Marines

escort you through the Admiralty

building and there are huge windows you

walk in this marble floor and you go up

one level of stairs and there's where

it's not entirely unlike when you folks

visited ladies Romay and there was the

big board that had all of the ships on

it and all the trade and everything

coming and going here you see a room

that's largely empty except for a tall

than old gentleman it looks to be in his

70s

he's got silver hair he's deathly

ryeowon he's wearing him he's wearing a

military uniform he's got a huge bushy

white mustache someone you haven't met

before yeah

I thought you were gonna say silver eyes

have we seen this guy in a cinematic

before I don't I don't think so I don't

think you as players I've seen this guy

in a cinematic I'm thinking there's only

been one or two medicine ematic well

there yeah there was one right at the

beginning where there was an old ryeowon

with a big white moustache oh oh maybe

that was maybe a map that maybe Matt

doesn't remember yeah I was when we came

in yes well you came into the city you

quote between ladies organ and some

other dude mm-hmm

it was the latest organ group there was

another group oh maybe you have maybe

Duke Marko Verona has made an appearance

in the cinematic well you didn't tell us

who it was it was just no yes I'm a guy

well no I'm keen to go back and see if

that's what was it might have been well

anyway yeah but he's he's standing in

front of a huge table it's much larger

than this table and it's very strangely

shaped it almost looks like it was it's

got irregular edges and it's in the

shape of like a big I like a capital I

with really long veins here or like a

sideways H right so it's does this and

and it's it's very expensive it's got

lapis lazuli all through it and it's got

gold thread running along it and as the

Marines escort you up to this gentleman

in this large room this huge table it

takes your eyes a second to recognize

what you're looking at because it's it's

mapping like inverse space all of the

empty space is land and the table

represents the oceans of Orden and so

this big part in the middle is like the

Bale sea and you recognize that like

where he is standing is where black

bottom would be and as if you walk up

and stand on the other side you're

standing where capital would be right

and so all of the edges of the table

mark the edges of the oceans and you see

that there is a little colored blocks

what yeah

yes and there are people there are other

officers here that are leaving like he's

dismissed them and there's some kind of

war game happening here and he's marking

they're different you fit you feel as

though if you could just look

this for like five minutes you'll be

able to figure out which ones these are

like major infantry units and which ones

are cavalry units and these are

obviously ocean units cuz look they're

in the water and this and there's a

whole bunch of activity around the

capital of Hegar yeah most of the model

fleets are in hey Gaara where Ajax's

Navy composed mostly of as Lorien and

chemists all different colors

representing what countries they're from

are facing off against the immortal

Empress's fleet and how's Verona's ships

that which are the same you can tell

they must be house bro ins because the

blocks the color blocks are the same

color as the skies uniform are are

protecting the Hegar and ships getting

in and out of the the contested area in

other words house Brona is protecting

the Empress's trade and keeping her in

the fight but none of his ships or

anywhere near ajax of ships and yeah

he's a very angular faced he's in his

probably late 70s and when the marines

COFF to introduce you he turns around

and he says ah capital capital when do

we need come by it gave me enough hints

didn't I yeah suppose you did you have

something for me

we've come to deliver a letter ah from

ladies room ah yes ladies sure owe me

huh yeah and he takes the letter and he

opens it and he's reading it and he says

ah ladies sure owe me you thought you

were moving your king it seems you've

moved your judge instead tell me Oh what

did you make of a little lady who runs

the big island yeah I think so too I

curious to see in which direction the

wind will blow when when the attention

comes to the stay is you're gonna speak

at the academy but dashed good keen to

know where you're gonna talk about hmm

million one ways to cook a mine flare ha

oh yeah the chaps will love it get the

cadets riled up and

and keen to fight a thing mind flayers

and these things they've never they've

never even they've never studied

anything like that no no we drill them

constantly on you

normal naval activity is nothing like

gastral see what yeah

curious to know he says and he's

pointing at the map it says curious to

know how you got from Black Bottom which

is kind of where he is heading all the

way over to any points where you're

standing to capital in two days

should've taken you to ten days what and

you have to fly your ship apart you've

seen my ship no no what is it though

what kind of vessel is it that you uh

that you command sir

is an illicit dreadnought by the gods ha

yes yes and uh I heard about in fact on

my cousin reported it and said you're a

very interesting vessel and it lifted

red not what capital capital yes and

what what are those little armaments he

described to me he said that you have no

had no cannons uh no balls and so

therefore you were passed inspection but

uh those little things on the side of

your boat there are some kind of cannon

or I'm a goldfish yes yes they are now

how are they powered you don't use a

gunpowder it's like again orgy powers

them psychic energy I don't think does

it come in buckets so there's a duh is

it's a powder that you sprinkle over

them comes you look it's you feed that

it's powered by prisoners slaves ah

didn't shoot them up and feed them to it

in a matter so what do you make of this

business on the pellet but the dragons

and Falcons what's the chain see in all

this who's he asking anyone I mean all

of you were here as far as I know but

the possible exception a big gap see if

force overstepping themselves I'm sorry

buddy just Matt's asking what I said I

said I see a force overstepping

themselves ah yes you're talking about

young de corona yes yeah so I'm curious

to know what he's up to

he's enjoys the privilege of being able

to sort of take a free hand and whatever

business he is interested in and then of

course young master Prospero sits back

and watches and waits to see what they

do how do you think young master

Prospero would feel about de Corona

picking off this war well I'm sure he'd

be glad to see it happen as long as he

wins I see that's that's the that's the

trick

what is how does that I think he's keen

to know how the public will feel now his

spills blood if he kills the princes man

wow you know depending on the

broadsheets report it could look bad for

him very bad indeed it's a poor way to

start a war being blamed as the

instigator but if it goes the other way

if they surrender if he's able to pull

off some kind of fait accompli well then

he may seem like a hero he'll cut de

Corona loose though if things go badly

for him oh so he's got an out well you

know his cousin is known for being

somewhat reckless he rides the blue

dragon after all and you know what they

say did we know they were related cousin

where do you see yourself in this sort

of situation of a brewing oncoming Civil

War in the city sort of hoping we could

talk about that uh everyone knows those

are gonna be a war and obviously we'd

like to be on the winning side but it's

not keen duh not obvious to me in which

direction things are gonna go it seems

like it seems like everyone's in a

similar boat right question is who's

gonna strike first yeah well no it's

gonna be planned or an accident could

happen all these armies well bumping

elbows something could happen

accidentally and then and then then we

all spring into action what does it take

because we've we've seen we've seen a

sort of rogue force of Knights of house

alvaro take over a stronghold on the

palate and the church and they already

struck down a message

yes and they struck down the captain red

Falcons in cold blood now do all those

happen every hour here and I think

didn't she live by our grace yes well

yeah and I think she rewarded you quite

nicely and now you walk around the city

with the prints of seals ah police he

says well I think wondering who's been

talking to you it seems to me that if

someone could maneuver a neutral band of

mercenaries into strike in the first

blow then they'd their hands would be

clean and a broadsheet so blame it all

on you mm-hmm well that's kind of what

the Dragons tried to do yeah they tried

to instigate a fight with us

yeah that's not the done thing

personally I'd hate to see Alvaro take

the pellet so to see it as uh as our

sort of thing don't you know it what

being an island and everything and uh us

being the Navy so we'd be happy if and

you see that there's like a little a

couple little tiny little blocks and

representing like the stays and the

pallet and there's like a an orange one

on the pallet and there's a navy unit

next to it and then there's a blue unit

over here I'm sorry I'm that was on

stays over here on the pallets and he's

like I personally if it were up to me

I'd be perfectly happy he takes a finger

he goes flick and he flicks the unit

that represents 12 dragons off the

pellet I'd be happy to see them back

where they belong if you only have some

kind of mercenary company that you could

maneuver in there well it's my

understanding that we've already helped

you a lot out what uh I recall we got

your your you got the unit of uh recall

scavengers Scouts yeah we're looking for

you and we made sure to deposit them

where they were beeps best useful with a

difficult IMing I might add ah yeah

that's fancy it's important when you're

now to give you the Tradewinds too they

have a good timing know which way the

wind is blowing

yes so perhaps we could strike a deal

you head over there and make a lot of

noise and maybe threaten them and these

say our ships off the coast

maybe they Corona hits the hint what

well we do uh carried seals of the Red

Dragons so it wouldn't entirely be Oh

Who am I trying to say it would wouldn't

be unusual yeah

for Knights of the red belt maybe it

would be prudent in fact your uh defend

the territory that were charged with

defending and you're officially officers

of the Prince yeah we could escort you

to the technically but the broadsheets

is accurate which of course it never is

technically you were trespassing last

time but this time you've got the

Princeton SEALs you could be escorted to

the library with a contingent of our

guards and uh looks over at the Marines

the two Marines that escort you over

here at nods like sure yeah absolutely

well and and I I think the red Falcons

are on our side mm-hmm I'm sure they

would much rather they would much rather

the well they would also like to see the

pellet or the the twelve dragons flicked

off of the pellet as it were it seems to

me we were in a position to help each

other out what yeah capital Apple I love

doing business before lunch makes me

feel like I've accomplished something in

the day I'm giving it looks like some of

you were thinking so I'm pausing this

scene so this is so you guys are

awkwardly sitting around in case you

guys wanna talk about something can we

talk meta yeah so it seems like he's

willing to sort of show his hand at this

point right like if he has his guys

escort us yes his name he's sitting off

yeah sitting off the coast of the island

it's what he's wanted all along well

it's also he wants a neutral force like

the mercenaries like us to be the one to

settle to powder it right yeah he wants

to be the one I think it's more so

what's what's the other houses name I

always confuse him we're at Verona

what's the other one called Varro I

think he's kind of sticking the middle

finger to Alvaro because he went and

[ __ ] with water territory without

working with him he says water territory

give me the pellet yes yes rounded by

water the deaths there believe that they

think that's water territory when in

fact that's the princess domain that

doesn't what matters is what he thinks

and what he's saying is we're not

officially our stuff we're not about to

help this guy take over the pellet

that's what he wants outright he's

saying I don't have it nobody has it

that's what he say uh the thing is like

for me I'm I'm on the same side we're

like we're not gonna go there with like

you know with Verona troops to roll up

on the pellet to team up with the red

Balkans to defeat the 12 dragons right

that's not what he's asking though he's

escorting us there to be a threat but he

even mentioned having troops sorry Mac a

nuclear right yeah I'm sorry yes what's

the question

is he talking about having troops

actually come with us yes the island yep

what he's saying is that I mean that and

he's not the first person to use this

kind of language and the broadsheets

have kind of reported on this stuff too

but no one wants to be perceived as

being the person that starts the war

because that would be so bad for PR yeah

but you're not gonna get any allies and

then you're not gonna win like if this

turns into a fight yeah which the thing

is if it turns into a fight between us

and the red Falcons and in the 12

dragons

I would've looks like it looks like the

red Falcons who are defending their

territory and we are part of that

contingent now it looks like they're

siding with the prince which would be

what perceived all right I mean what

what he has said in this meeting is that

like if if Alvaro's knights

take over the light they've already

taken over the library and lady Antonia

has already said we're gonna take it

back mm-hmm if she tries that she's

probably gonna curl all her men are

gonna die right and if that happened

those are the dragon because well I mean

because of I mean the

yeah they're just cops like it's like

cops versus Special Forces Special

Forces guys are gonna win out they've

got all sorts of crazy abilities than

lady Anthony is just a like a fighter

basically and so if that happens yeah

they'd get they'd get them it would go

from so it's diplomacy right where

they've moved their unit in there but

they have to wait for the end of the

term before it counts as being theirs

before they've taken it and Lady Anthony

is gonna try and stop them from holding

at the end of this turn and if if 12

dragons win then how solve our Oh

everyone everyone's equal right now how

solve our will gain a victory point but

it will also be perceived as that having

started the war especially if they

murder a bunch of the princes men so

that's why that's why this Duke is like

this is kind of crazy I don't know

what's gonna get a stalemate it depends

on how the broadsheets reported is what

he said it depends on how they report it

cuz it could come out looking like yeah

but do we get the impression that he's

doing this as a way for him to take

control of the pellet he didn't say that

directly but he did say he did say we

sort of feel like this is yes yeah I

mean let's be frank what

hello this territory neutral territory

the princess territory it's up for grabs

now all right Prince have been dead for

how many years none of these none of

these if he were looking at the map he'd

be like none of these places are gonna

be independent Prince's territory for

long right well unless there's a prince

oh sure of course yes unless there's a

prince yes

but how do we determine who the next

prince is people read jump back into it

like oh yeah clear uh I think one thing

that just would have talked about with

everybody is that like obviously we're

gonna do this zeorge thing right Georgie

and so like that's going to I think the

word to maybe help us do this again yes

to help us and would then mean also part

of the princess domain like they could

potentially like linson and their men to

help with dealing with the pellet

because I think we'd like to keep that

in differences

roll because that's what we're part of

essentially and we're trying to ban that

group together you guys are trying to

start your own faction yeah we're trying

to reinforce it and reestablish like

their territories and powerpoints and

stuff I mean that's what that's what

that's what the commander of the chain

is saying yeah you guys are gonna try

and start your own faction and that if

you can get if you can help if you can

like it seems I mean zohr and when the

chapter a spendthrift there's a lot more

reasonable to do with than Zorich like

like if that guy was in charge probably

it'd be tit for tat and George might

help you guys out and kind of join you

quote-unquote but Matt does not know

it's gonna depend on what happens with

ladies organ but certainly the red

Falcons are gonna be in your debt if you

save their ass at that point you've got

two sevenths of the princes knights on

your side yeah and you're on your way to

building your own 8th faction but

definitely Duke Marko Verona and all of

the other lords of capital all the other

guys that were charged this who are

playing this game they see it as a game

of diplomacy and all of these are

neutral territories which they want to

they want they're not gonna fight each

other first they're gonna they're gonna

they're gonna grab this neutral stuff

this mm-hmm and I'm hoping that by us

helping out the word and then again the

red Falcons might send a message to

other Prince's guards just indicate that

like hey we're here we're serious about

like getting this group back together

and like being a stronger strong

contender in this game well so that's

judge's strategy regarding how do we how

do we play this game at diplomacy well

we start our own it's not a seven player

game it's an eight player game but

that's not what you're telling this guy

all right let's talk with this guy but

like let's not make promises or like

give them anything let's be discreet

like let's be careful you should send

more of these because I get all these

little things right so that's gonna be

the trick I think for you folks based on

your telling me is that this guy is

asking you this kind of help him defend

this neutral territory because it's his

intention to then take that dude he

wants to do it subtly right because he

want to do all the books well I mean

he's probably going to make there's not

gonna be a contract involved

make an inside check let's play some D

and D let's Bert dice you're getting the

princess band back that's a number yeah

my character she D of n them Who am I

playing it's wisdom so well showing up

there with his guys and making demands I

mean people are gonna read that as we're

taking his song we're definitely not

gonna show up there with like some other

it's not what we're just we're just

providing us an escort you seen escort

but like it's a wink-wink escort yeah

right right from the stars in s coitus

the tick is showing that we have back up

he's trying to make a show the fact that

like the who is this Verona that Verona

is gonna take over the pellet because

they believe it's their territory but he

wants to wait for the game to start yeah

right and set it off basically and take

the fall for it and then that way they

can jump in and act like it's already

kind of started and that they're not

actually involved they're just playing

the game now it's like that sounds

reasonable to me twelve Dragons have

made a faux pas in doing this right like

yes that's a real risky move if we show

up and we're just like hey cool piss off

yeah they start a fight it looks just

doubly bad for them because ready to cut

it loose because they you know they've

acted a bit out of turn right miss ma

bittern they might just done those yeah

yeah by the way that's true you guys

have not they were really do it you look

how easy it was to defeat their head

let's just go and take this place over I

think either way bottom line is if we

let the if we ignore this situation with

12 Dragons in the pellet 12 Dragons

gonna kill the red Falcons which is you

know okay and the whole city is watching

like that's what everyone like that said

that it's gonna look really bad for them

right okay now look boys

so here's think it'll look bad for them

but Prospero can still cut them right he

can say they're actually I've turned but

that point [ __ ] kicked off yeah yeah

he's a notorious there you know there'd

be a statement for his hothead and a

smooth represent

currently allied with us will be dead

and yeah lose one out of like the seven

princes guard that we could possibly

like ally to our cause

who do we want to win the game us wait

we want to be Prince there are license

where did that become a thing I guess we

look here now hahaha why is that is epic

is that our goal we have outstanding

which is kill mortem no no I'm just be

easier to do if we you know have an

entire unified cities army at our I mean

my impression mortem is gonna come to us

yeah come in so it's just like we got to

figure out like how to amass as much

power as possible and if we can do that

on our own terms like that's the way I

would like to do it rather than because

I don't I don't know where these Nobles

lie like I don't know where these the

other guilds and stuff like that where

they're at but like as far as I'm

concerned when a jack shows up everybody

loses

so hey Jack's hopes for the same thing

yeah don't you so I think that was the

point you were making earlier was that

as far as judge is concerned the chain

strategy is to kind of coagulate all of

the all the currently independent

Prince's troops and create an eighth

faction I mean that point putting the

eight factions and to win the game

exactly it's like we're not fence

sitting like we know what we want to do

we're just playing the game differently

sounds cool to me I have no idea if

that's possible we're all gonna find out

together previously it was get the

factions together and then work with

this what the side we wanted but now

it's yeah they got there well I mean you

play diplomacy right yeah as it says in

the actual rule for diplomacy there's no

way to make progress without a line with

somebody and then if you keep reading

and says there's also no way to win

without stabbing your ally in the back

it's actually a header in at least the

old version of diplomacy that I started

there was a header called

the stab it's like just so you know that

it's not possible to win this game we're

allies in the back we should probably

start a game of diplomacy tomorrow so

some people can learn out

diplomacy that's good idea I actually

don't know actually it's not a great

idea but some people need to learn if

you stab turn one I've had friends

friends of mine

I had a friend of mine who wanted to

play diplomacy well that you want to

play it like Axis and Allies and never

never negotiate with anybody about

anything and not long thereafter he

wasn't in that game anymore he was

really really really angry yeah actually

we could play a blind game we could play

a blind game of diplomacy so such a

distraction saying I didn't do it

because you constantly think about it

and then you're working any but you're

thinking about that if you can just sing

that way for like a couple hours to be

done but like yeah well originally and

people watching no originally my plan

was that the the map of capital is the

diplomacy map it's just been altered but

it's topologically identical to the map

of diplomacy and my goal was to actually

have friends of mine and some of our

kind of internet neighbors run the major

factions and play a game of diplomacy

and that would be the plot of this game

the problem is that the scale of play

doesn't match up like it would have to

be in order for it to be happening live

it would have to be something like a

turn took two weeks right and at that

rate it would take forever to [ __ ]

finish the game and so the to the two

things don't align right unfortunately

that was my original plan I think the

way that I'd want to play this with

talking to this guy is that we would

need to consider like what it looks like

to have Verona there especially if we're

going to take on the 12 Dragons right

because obviously it's not in their best

interest to be looking like they're

starting a fight whereas we can renew

Trull as long as it's just us you know

on our own working with the Red Dragons

- or I'm sorry we're going to red

Falcons to get the Dragons out of there

so we wouldn't want to jeopardize their

good standing

well his grace Lord Verona is just

offering you an escort for him it's it's

more like you know some like a small

unit the fact

like a D for size using our warfare

rules a d4 sized unit that could make a

difference if everything came down to it

but ultimately it would be deniable it

would be like oh all I was doing was

making sure they got where they were

going

we're the Navy that's our job it's not

it's not my army yeah I know means these

were just some escorts these were just

some guards that we sent some Marines so

we sent with them so it's plausible

deniability is what he's offering what

if we I've no idea you the broadsheets

mm-hmm like make a public a public

demand or you know a public request

whatever you want to call it for the

third the Dragons to get the hell off

the I heard to get what's-his-name how

far to we call them right yeah and then

if he doesn't well then he looks bad

yeah that's a good point too yeah yeah

spotlight on him yeah shift the tone of

the conversation yeah because the Valen

yeah then that that means that we've

given them a warning yeah right we've

said this is the princess territory the

warning shot right right we work we work

for the Prince now right we do it

publicly so all the other princes

territories see it right of course all

the other noble houses see it everyone

[ __ ] sees it everybody everybody

reads the broadsheets

everybody says that they don't trust it

but everybody that's all right that's

all and then if he doesn't do it and we

show up to make the to make that demand

right and he starts fight well yeah I

really don't mind if why didn't you why

didn't you pull your man back yeah I

just say that now in my real life all

the time now just cause no idea what

we're talking about cuz he refuses to

watch the new trailer for the lighthouse

yeah yeah

no I did tell me one yeah yeah yeah what

was the one we watched it in yeah oh

yeah yeah when will now I'll be then

okay

yeah well that's that sounds cool to me

how are you gonna go about doing that

yeah they we have to who runs the

broadsheets Ian I think

the broadsheet guilt desire there is a

specific name well we right we have one

of our guys are barred potentially right

up a big fancy Proclamation right with

the [ __ ] the the princess guards CEO

on it yeah and we have somebody just

leaked to the press that the princess

guards are gonna make a big Proclamation

today

at the library right and they show up

and whoever though it's presumably reads

it in his Bartok fashion mm-hmm

and everyone hears it and they write

about it mm-hmm that's my guess most

esteemed Knights dragons if you do it

publicly yeah I mean yeah cuz we wanted

to get well the thing is like we wanted

to to get out as like an advertisement

the broadsheets that guarantees it's

gonna be put in right because if Iran

cheats or Slynt like if they're biased

and they don't want to report on it then

we don't have any control over it maybe

that might work you'd have to hurry

though cuz whatever's gonna happen on

the pallet is gonna happen within like

the next 72 hours right okay well Rogers

could not ever like yeah I think the

victim but there's more than one a day

you guys have personally experienced

like in the time it took you to get from

this one in to the Pharaoh's dream a

broadsheet had come out reporting on

what you had done well it doesn't have

to be any of us that go there and like

do that right like we could try

something up and then send it to angel

and me like angel make this happen

I'm sure yeah you can do that for us no

problem yes just being a messenger like

that yeah ultimately though that but

having should probably send uh having

the senior command yeah you know the

chain there would lend it some mm-hmm it

will light some weight I would think I

just wonder if we yeah I think we can do

both right the only thing is like it I

haven't feeling that whenever we show up

there and trying to make the

proclamation that dickery know is just

such a jackass like he's just gonna

wanna fight us right then in there so

they'll be no chance for a report to

happen and then for

for it to shed oh yeah you're right

you're right yeah yeah and taking on the

pages probably yeah we'll just do both

or something and whatever we're ready to

go and confront them right and we'll

just go and we'll read the proclamation

out like make a big [ __ ] show of it

and people will be like oh that's

happening and then the proclamation that

could say we're gonna be there at this

and such and say you got 24 hours for

you to formally relinquish control of

the library that sounds [ __ ] cool to

me to to let her know to folder by the

way I started working on a script for a

video in which we talked about different

ways to use inspiration because I

[Laughter]

already use script I was writing script

for running the game video which we talk

about inspiration and kind of the

difference between how I think it's

intended to be used and how I have

started using it which is just to reward

players for having really cool ideas and

to reinforce good ideas over what might

otherwise turn into blind alleys mm-hmm

but I mean with that said I guess if

this dude wants to send along a very

very small contingent or something or at

least escort us via ship there and then

stay off the island while we take care

of business to maintain I think we

should make it clear to him that we

don't intend to hand in the pellet all

right that's not yeah he's gonna stay on

this thing that like Joe just thinking

right now is like well if it's small

enough contingent we're gonna get into a

fight right he's gonna get messy people

die when things get messy so maybe they

don't come back I'll make an inside

check 23 the trick is that when the dust

settles you folks want to be in charge

of felony you were allies mm-hmm so that

goal is to try to do with this in such a

way that the Navy doesn't end up with

more troops there than you guys like I

see or you don't have very many troops

yes well I mean why does if you count

there you you've got

two units on you have you have you have

your normal infantry and the folks

survived black bottom and we're on the

boat with you real-time and now you have

the advancers and the advances are a

small unit but they are one of the most

highly trained units in all of capital

like they have seen action there the

chain of Akron's elite Scouts they've

seen action the likes of which no one in

the city can imagine so it's kind of

like that churn thing we're like if

we're if we say we fight or whatever we

get the library and then the Train

happens before the alvaro comes then we

get it before they could like sneak in

and almost kind of yeah I mean it

depends on it depends on how the battle

goes and who's who has how many troops

left at the end yeah because if you guys

are decimated but the Marines have you

taken hardly any casualties then it

could be the house Verona this guy takes

the pellet but if house Verona's a

little one d4 unit with you folks gets

wiped out and you guys hardly take any

casualties then you guys are gonna hold

the palette but you always have like a

contingency plan - right because we're

about to say absorbs or just ask so it's

so I mean if anything if we need to like

a little extra most or a backup to help

reinforce the pellet so I can make sure

our claim there is solid then we could -

yeah that's your revenge right yes I -

this guy am well you can have a little

unit but we still see one unit but we

got we got something else to do before

that right goo Goo's because we left to

go and save well sort out the dead night

in between us going to the pellet mm-hmm

that would be kind of an order of event

yeah I figure out this orange thing and

then we can figure out the appellate

thing Duke Markov Rome is keen to know

how things are going in Colin's gate

this is where you guys are

that's the district you got its the

neutral district you guys are in has two

neighborhoods Kings Cross which you guys

are not in and the person is Kings Cross

is called that well Keys Cross has the

quite large prison in it that's actually

a victory point and the purses has the

mint in it and that is a victory point

and you guys are in the neighborhood of

the persons that's where the dancing

minstrel is that's where the butcher

shop is what do you make of house Verona

or house Valletta as far as what's their

what's their hand in all of this now as

far as I know Lenny just broods and her

crumbling castle and collects taxes and

Pines or her dead husband mm-hmm so

she's been doing a little bit more than

that what wait what what yeah what uh

speaking of not the done thing would you

ever send a a death knight out on an

errand total total hypothetical now what

are we talking about here a death

Knights what's this all about

uh well lady for let us set a death

knight to callings gate shaded what in

broad daylight

well now that's to threaten a city guard

with a brain melting yeah well yeah

interfered with the princes men that's

not the done thing that's not capital

hmm yeah let me look into this it's all

very well yeah it needs is like yeah

this is actually he says this is capital

black bottom yeah well this seems to be

it seems exactly like the kind of

trouble that's been following us around

since we got here he walks over to a a

bellpull it looks like a large

elaborately woman ribbon and pulls on it

and a guy in red armor like a bright red

lacquered armor and a red helmet and a

halberd opens a door it's like 40 or 50

feet away is a huge room and he stands

there at attention and he's the Duke

Marco says Lord crass go get me go

[ __ ] and this gentleman nods and turns

and walks away he says I'll have my men

look into this you know I think most of

have been happy to let to let young

Lenny sit there in her little dark abode

and and brood but if she's gonna

interfere with the princess men

something must be done

yeah we thought the same thing so yeah

she's coming back to calling skate come

look for some forgotten mother I

important heirloom oh I don't know she

just came out spouting nonsense and

demanding that George find some piece of

jewelry or something for her she'd melt

his brain yeah new broach is one thing

is that she's coming back within within

the day this guy gives you a look like a

very piercing intelligent look this 70

year old Duke Admiral of the Navy and

says who was it exactly that this death

knight demanded an artifact an heirloom

from was it you or was it the word it's

the word right yeah and the man drew two

guards are like that's the word over

there

yeah there commander it was the

commander over there and the two Marines

look at each other in the moon says

dwarf I think his name Sarge Sarge

now not a real name but mmm this is very

strange and why why him and why now and

and what caused all this you don't

happen to know anything about this do

you we were just passing through

hmm it's not clear that he believes you

after a moment a one of the walls that

has a bookcase against it the bookcase

goes in slides open and a young lady she

looks like she's in her early 20s

she's short she's blond she has blonde

hair in a ponytail and she's wearing a

very like professional looking outfit

expensively tailored very matei live in

the sense of

there's all this little filigree and

stuff like that but other than that

there's not much ornamentation in her

outfit she's very severe looking and she

reports and she's standing there and

she's I think probably apart from you

she's she's shorter than most of you and

Duke Marko Verona says what do you make

of all this come on we gotta let young

miss Laura get away with this and the

young woman says well your grace at like

she knows exactly what you folks are

talking about even though she wasn't in

the room when this happened mm-hmm she

says if I were being threatened by a

goal death night under the control of

the Codex mortis

I'd hire a band of mercenaries to deal

with it have any suggestions I regarding

what these mercenaries might do and the

young woman says kill her it would be

difficult it would cost you a few lives

but and she she looks at her boss and

you have this sense that this is not

something she would say if not for the

fact like well you called me here in

front of these people so it must be okay

to say this the codex mortis does not

have the power to maintain ladies organs

presence in this world on a permanent

basis it would be a month before the

Duchess would be able to be summon her

and my professional opinion your grace a

month from now no one will recognize the

city never get inside does anybody else

think it's a spy

[Laughter]

she read Matt's story about the dragon

lady ah she's a patron hmm hmm yeah you

shouldn't really have death Knights just

walk around the streets all right not

safe at all no

do intend to dispose of this death nine

will that be only for grace and the Duke

says what yes yes you still here yes by

all means thank you rot and sheep's

turns out walks away my name is Givat

which is obviously not a real name

because it is a dance course I mean I

knew that I don't ya doing that Allison

the old about discotheques yes like a

wizard maybe not even every moon and so

you can see that Duke is staring at the

board in front of him the map of the

Seas of Orden is saying a month a month

what could happen in a month I'll be

over to my easel three days can we go

hey Gaara in a month time a month ha

I'll be surprised if the Empress lasts a

week we'll see she's put up a tough

fight what and we're doing everything we

can to help her obviously I mean the

longer Ajax fiddles around here on the

other side of the world

the longer we have and of course there's

always the possibility that the Empress

might win ha a longer maybe cool alright

if we um what what's what's sure owe me

gonna think of of you are helping us

kick Alvaro's men off oh I don't imagine

she'll like it

what but uh she has her own problems I

think and we're keen to see how they

play out what do you think sure Omni is

okay with them with the Dragons being on

the pellet oh she has her own problems I

think hmm busy over there on the stays

they are dealing with the Matt doesn't

remember the name of the Knights its

Knights of the black gloves all right

there's ones that took over yeah you met

them they had like a pair of leather

gloves like end to their shoulder armor

and those guys have taken over the

Citadel yeah it sure only tried to hire

she has already failed to hire you guys

to stop them

mmm shooting stars or some p.m. yeah oh

really

yeah okay yeah we turn that down for a

different job right well you kind of put

her on oh that was that was the pregnant

lady from the office of exchange

integrity who came and said you folks

did well for yourself because you guys

were at the Pharaoh's dream and she was

trying to help again she was like these

guys have taken over this or they're

about to take this over and when she

didn't say it was the reason they're

able to get troops on the island is

because [ __ ] Duke Marko and his Navy

guys are just gonna drop them off like

just offload as other actions troops

onto our island so that we can't

actually stop them from the black gloves

guy is there for my church right house

no more house guys you have there the

only interaction you guys have had

without Navarre are those guys yeah the

blood and the Knights of the Black Lodge

they were wings like it's these [ __ ]

like they come in deserve to get beaten

in by Ajax

whoever wins would certainly have to be

a very adroit player of the game and

probably have a lot of soft power and

hard power and that fact blaming and

that that that faction would probably

disagree with the idea that they deserve

to get beaten they just say we quit

we're gonna beat Ajax cuz we want this

game we can't live oh great that's why

Carla say we own it yeah but in the

meantime they're gonna pedal II squabble

over unclaimed lands and well if we come

to heel that's true if you could become

an eighth faction in the game and win

yeah I mean they're just hoping their

goal is to make sure that that all that

all resolves before Ajax gets her and

that's kind of what this map is showing

this map is showing that house Verona's

Navy is protecting Pagar and trade so

that they can continue to fight and

delay Ajax got it anyway mmm who would

house Verona C on the throne is slim

asking that yeah it's a house loan asks

it was fine well I mean it just

basically he wants to know if they had

their druthers who would be the Prince

Clark we would be you owe me lots I'm

modest Eva you know me ah I'm getting on

in years but certainly it would have to

be somebody whose priority was the

security of the city as represented by

her Navy greatest Navy in the world

don't you know what I mean what is

capital except the center of trade all

this greatness we've built over these

generations because of the free trade

coming in and out our navy protects all

those ships are you done have a name was

that mean like all right what's the name

that's - lets lets you know that's to be

that's to be determined you know yeah

yeah I'm sure some some appropriate

cousin or nephew could be found - but

the to fit the bill I think my yet to be

determined he means it's not actually

that important hmm it would be a puppet

of yeah yeah that's a reasonable

interpretation what you said so it's

what everyone has said essentially right

yes nobody wants to be the prince

well not if you've already won the game

I write here you're gonna get at least

like one generation of whoever the

princes or what we're a faction back

some getting to do their thing and then

it's gonna be the dust has settled and

whoever lost has had time to lick their

wounds and kind of build something up

mm-hmm

have we heard anything else about the

shooting star some specific actually you

might have in the eye I think there

aren't one of the broadsheets

yeah I think we've had a broadsheet that

referenced the Knights of the ship wait

the Knights of the shooting stars as I

thought it was they went in they cleared

out the cult yeah they were they were

nothing

nights they were a mercy yeah there were

mercenaries that they were and they were

high they were actually they were

mercenaries so much it's they're

actually an adventuring company they're

like a proper D&D company that were

hired to go in and it turned out that

there there was the idea was there were

pirates

that had occupied this a little but they

weren't pirates they were cultists and

they had summoned demons right so

there's all sorts of crazy you should

going on in there and the Knights of the

black gloves are like those guys patrons

so now the Knights of but now this this

adventuring company is kind of left and

the knights of black gloves have taken

over and sure Oh me and the Fulton we're

like ah [ __ ] it's like the last thing we

want and so they're kind of in the same

situation that the palate isn't except

appel it's neutral territory but this is

ladies Romy's actual land some of the

two problems

this one the palette is getting more

attention because it looks like it's

going to light earlier but this one is

actually a much bigger deal it's a

factions fighting directly yeah got it

okay anyway it is a 21 we're gonna take

a break because actually sitting in this

position is the absolutely the worst

[ __ ] thing for my neck which is still

killing me

there's nothing it's my lot in life so

we're gonna take a break and come back

in about 13 minutes and find out what

happens next

maybe there's some fan art I don't know

I haven't I've been wow I have no doubt

and being patient everybody those of you

who have hung around this long this is

the point at which we enjoy reviewing

any fan art that folks have sent us if

any and I really have no idea what

people so I don't think they could

really see the song so this is the other

two panels yeah the other channels are

empty the backside looks like this it's

just I guess Emax notes it's just blank

huh there is so that I can put stuff in

your vomit I believe man O'Driscoll did

you tweet a picture of this I did just

now

oh you're going Twitter tweeter so yeah

what sort of highlighted run B yeah we

also have a second stream finally when

we do have tactical combat which has at

times in this campaign featured quite

prominently not not so far tonight but

the night is young there was a whole

second stream you can check out if you

want to get a really clear view of we're

all the minis and everything art because

I think often you need to know where

everything is positioned for the sort of

impossible to see wow that's awesome

[Music]

[Laughter]

right that we saved in action is that

King oh it's like yeah taking awesome

baths and flowers well each of the

flowers have a different meaning and I

don't I don't like tied into like oh

this dope ass jacket is got like quotes

from the chain on it this is awesome

golden commissioned it are you serious

yeah that's awesome

the flowers are flowers open oh I

recognize that guy st. Ajax wanker the

dragonburn tonight as we were trying to

fare slim never drew a sword that's

right you had your hand

no is it because we took her do we get

dough part cuz we took a long break we

should take more long breaks to get

better you had that art three weeks ago

three weeks ago two pieces added to it

man the coat and yeah we should play

more often yes yes yeah so we were

having a discussion out in the kitchen

about what you folks are gonna do when

the question came up about the actual

what is the what is the makeup of the

different forces in the game

and it's hard to tell because this kind

of cream color thing looks like neutral

ground but it's not it's a faction if

you count up all the gray squares all

the unclaimed territory it's like one

two three four five six seven eight nine

ten eleven twelve thirteen thirteen

power centers currently unclaimed and

the strongest faction in the game right

now

has four so if if you were I mean it's I

don't know how pop how reasonable it is

for you folks to take over all of the

prairie territory when all these

different factions are all fighting over

attack hasn't played diplomacy

whatever that's true that's true and she

wanted one yeah would it be remarkable

play diplomacy and you won your first

time at once I'm going to Anna played

the Avalon Hill dune board game because

I had never played before and won her

first game played like a [ __ ] pro and

I was disgusted and depressed and yeah

that's the makeup of the city and where

things stand right now and you can even

see that one of the places like there's

a contested spot and the map is gonna

change

as soon as but you'll probably the

climax of book 1 is going to be the war

breaking out probably that's the the

timing of where you guys are and how

much time is left before the end of book

1 and how close everything is to war so

yeah well so duke verona is he's I kind

of played his cards

you folks have learned something

important about ladies organ and he has

said that he's willing to you know

escort your soldiers to the pallet to

the library

so that if something happens with the

with the assumption that if something

happens with DES corona and the 12

Dragons that you'll get a little bit of

a boost because you've got some of his

troops there

tonight so I don't know if there's

anything else gonna be else there ask

them you guys chad is noticing a lack of

deviltry and evil that they were told to

expect now that a judge is in charge

we'll see we'll see we'll see what

happens well yeah let me just my kid

dies right now she's exiled he just

wants you folks to let him know when you

need to be ferried over to the pellet

yeah looks like we survived our

interaction with Leroy it would be like

tomorrow afternoon ish right yeah cuz we

death nice tomorrow morning you might

need a nap we might need a little nap

yep you know after we fight ya around

I thought that was tomorrow tomorrow

assuming they'll not needy lunch now

he's about to have lunch

she told us okay yeah so as far as I

know unless it's possible that I have

miss remembered something concerning we

took like we could do off that you guys

after you guys rested and when you and

when you were done resting that's when

lady zorga

confronted George and it's only been

like four hours since then and most of

that four hours was spent with you guys

getting here yeah and then meeting with

this guy and so now he's gonna excuse

himself for lunch and you know he's he

seems pretty happy to have met you folks

and glad that you speak the same

language and came to see how things turn

out

and then yeah he's gonna that's the only

game who among you has the now that is

it still okay I mean I can hand it off

boots

watts doesn't matter I mean it's up to

judge I think you know the right stuff

[Music]

[Laughter]

well you got to write out a thing so we

can send it to angel so he can sense the

broadsheets yeah so I would recommend

that we also let Antonia know hey don't

like wait for us to show at stall are

you

yeah mm-hmm yeah dude yeah cuz if she

goes in and we're not there

she'll be guns blazing well she's dead f

Dirk Verona will have his Marines escort

you out okay all right Thank You Duke

yeah nice to wait I can do business with

you what excellent yes we'll be in touch

and the Marines old and escort you out

of the out of the out of the estate and

then you're on your own and heading back

to I assume heading back to Collins Hill

headed back to the purses headed back to

the dancing minstrel yeah about to ask

Artie what he discovered during oh

that's right Yeah right right captured

and filleted burned skewered barbecued

mauled well what what what exactly were

your instructions to him like what did

you want him to check out because I

think probably based on what I think of

what you had said he would have spent

his time flying around inside the

building you guys were in checking it

out yeah I think that's fair right and

that building is like right it's like an

office building yeah and like it was a

casa yeah yeah well who do we want to

rock Undead yeah it's gonna be gone I'll

be playing the thieves from the new

senior officers of the chain and it

means that we be stronger it's a good

thing we have a clerks yeah no we don't

well

but not as the oh sorry I thought I was

like of course we do I thought I thought

you were a cleric no druids are kind of

clerics they don't turn and it's also

it's also really easy like there's not a

lot of combat healing in fifth edition

there's some yeah yeah so far all

they've done my artificer he can brew

potions of healing or 25 gold pieces in

six hours each that's cool yeah well

none of us can make potions what you see

is this kind of stick he took the

alchemists specialization oh cool

and it gives you allows you to brew the

the point he's out as allows you to brew

potions of healing and something else at

a quarter of the cost and like a quarter

of the time Russell it's not only 200

yeah it's expensive I can't do math 100

I don't remember

standby yeah yeah I mean everyone else

is like they're the only ones that have

been doing right it [ __ ] up recive

like ya can also craft magic items well

they're also like a neutral faction like

all the other factions are kind of

active politically but apart from

dispatching ladies organ which she

literally only did because you guys hung

onto the rod instead of giving up like

she probably if you guys have given the

rod to the sapphire sky this wouldn't

like ladies organ would never shut up

yeah so now now she's sort of like all

of a sudden activewear before she was

passing you don't know I know the crown

was a gift wasn't it from another house

thing is like she's the only one who

well mmm she's the one who's keeping an

eye on [ __ ] coming out of ring well it

seems like I don't know about the other

factions so it's like if we can take her

means to be able to do a deeper enduring

well seems like a thing to do

I mean I'm not on one side of the other

but like pissing her off is probably the

least

as for politically they might it might

be like as far as like the monsters she

can send against you the worst thing you

can do all right but politically it

seems like it's the least

yeah I mean that's a good question lady

Valletta the the reason that all that

yellow territory is an a giant undead

city which by the way like that's larger

than all of black bottom yeah just that

one part mmm the reason that is that way

is because she read the codex mortis and

one of the rituals and in codex mortis

is the bringing back of people that

can't be brought back so you would have

to lot lots of people have tried to

figure out what happened what wrong and

none of them have been able to figure it

out so it's not that it's impossible

it's that you would have to do something

extraordinary to succeed where cuz

obviously other political factions of

the game have thought well if we can do

this

you know she failed but if we can do it

then we be on a good side and I was able

to do so certainly it's unusual that

even incredibly powerful rituals that

are denied to most mortal men have

failed to bring back máximo Valletta

where's he at where's the soul yeah

maybe it's been destroyed maybe it's

been an island maybe that's why I can't

be brought back you know because if it's

just in Hell which I don't know anything

about but yeah you got a shape to sail

us there absolutely yeah just bring it

bring the chain but but you would have

to you would have to do some active

research you would have to go go

somewhere well we're gonna have to get

the library again like that yeah but the

library is like a civic resource before

looking up deeds and houses of stuff

you'd have to go to either somebody who

knows crazy as that some high very high

level person those crazy esoteric [ __ ]

or go to a magical library which in in

this context is probably house

I meet Justin terry NPC I could be yeah

how's our run the university which is

also includes the Royal College of

sorcery there's ones that took the took

the the fortress from no their the

sponsored house all borrower the

sponsors of trial dragons oh they're

their major like the duke Prospero

Alvaro who is in your terms he's like an

eighth level magic user

he's one of the Lords of capital I

select the Lords of capital is this

phrase that people use to mean the

secret people that pull the strings

right the different from the Great

Houses but like the 1 or 2 of the heads

of the Great Houses count as Lords of

capital like the Bishop at the head of

house Navarre is one of them because

he's like an anything little cleric like

lady sure Oh me might not even have

class level sweet notes

oh so 1 or 2 of the heads of the Great

Houses are these really powerful

sorcerers or a prince gotcha or whatever

so yeah that would see for me you would

have to do actively you would have to be

like okay where's this [ __ ] University

ok who do we know that nose look like

really powerful sages so we can start

doing research that information is

probably not just gonna fall in your lap

all right there might be like a down

time yeah all right what are you guys

gonna do between now and tomorrow so

we're gonna get a broadsheet thing done

and send it to I guess Senate find you

like you got 72 hours like you can you

can just say okay this is what we're

doing

yeah between now and the next time we

play I've written something epic and

profound and biting and claim you want

angel anyone angel typical is nice to

the broadsheets yeah wait do we do it

okay so between now and next week we

need to figure out what it says yeah

probably at least in general like you

don't actually have to write it it would

be cool if you did you don't have to

write it in fiction you could just say

we want to say these things right right

and then and then probably I'll write it

up or something

yeah yeah as soon as possible or certain

timing to this thing I wonder cuz if we

go to the island

what we're gonna we're giving him a

deadline okay we're saying like hey like

if y'all don't clear out like right at

this point like we're kind of showing up

and the if I recall your pitch it was

the idea is you're you're talking to

Prospero alvaro yes you're calling him

out yeah I'm not you're computing him in

the spot right you're trying to take the

spotlight off of 12 dragons damn right

right recreated violated you know

another violated the princess land right

you know we have to seal brought

dishonor on his family name dungeon

there's two different types of wood that

they like yeah it's like chop it up

chip-chop

[Music]

the gate we want to well well you if you

want to talk to her you know you gather

we got to figure out what you want to

say like is it worth us even trying to

like fighter if we want to try and use

the rod anyway it comes down to it like

bucket you're [ __ ] right let's go

from well that's by the way for those of

you wondering I'm sure somebody's

wondered when I came up with that crazy

line the chain of background prepares to

fight death with death before I was like

that's a cool [ __ ] line but I don't

know if they're gonna use the rod wait

it's this message Tom I said hey just

FYI if you guys fought ladies organ it

came down to it would you use the rod

he's like [ __ ] yeah I had to do I would

use the rod I'm like okay thanks make

sure my line of dialogue made sense

there's no there's not

quote-unquote there's a in order to

attune to it you have to say the

passwords so it's not like it's a like

command it to do something with a word

you just have to say the past France

sure how to use it we're not really sure

exactly yeah maybe maybe we could just

you know maybe show let's go home come

on Thailand yeah well hey I like do we

do it we want to basically say look

we've we've got it leave leave zeorge

alone I mean it works it's close enough

what it works a little bit there but if

you flip it the lines don't line up the

other way doesn't work yeah so I mean do

we want basically just to take the heat

off from George and say hey we've got it

if if your lady wants it she needs to

come and talk to us instead of sending

her but can attack dogs after us no cuz

we're not gonna give it to her like

that's not that's not even the same she

doesn't know that we have it she doesn't

even know we have it mmm she can't go

around making threats against you know

officers of of the prince neutral

territory

yeah here just go making demands and you

know go find it yourself

all these things are true everything you

say through you know but like hey Frank

for that schedule a meeting with her it

might provide cover for our for our

infiltrators for infiltrators for the

highest um well we'll see I mean you

know I'm just gonna come out swinging

will you stop I brought you with I have

looted room over here I brought you a

table no there's another

sorry beige anyway so yes the Sun

crosses the sky begins to get lower it's

going to be night and then tomorrow

morning you'll meet what's this bucket

at the courthouse are you telling angel

we want to rob baletta right or I don't

know what do you what do you think well

I let us seems like as good a place as

any especially if we survive this then

yeah there may not be a death knight

there - mmm you know worried about so we

have to worry about for our heist crew

yeah it seems like the kind of thing

where you know it'sit's the least likely

to stir up any political [ __ ] right and

it's it's they're probably not going to

expect us but you know on the same note

yeah I don't know I feel like it's more

dangerous to potentially start [ __ ] with

the faction that's more involved in you

know this more heat up for a civil war

right yeah well the church is about to

have a fourth power center so it might

be worth striking a blow at them since

they already have troops out but is this

is this a blow is it striking a blow

well you know we could steal more than

just that one thing I think it's messy

we're not we're not mean we're not

Bergling we're trying to retrieve a very

specific thing I wanted to get messy I

think an evil person will probably steal

some I'm lawful I'm sorry well she's not

thief I don't want things done right

I went taken necessary risk if we don't

have to make sense oh you know you have

a book that has our stats what a book

stats yeah it's this I don't know where

Lars I don't know what you're doing yeah

but what it seems is it you're not

you're not you're not you're not

fighting they're not fighting the CR 13

you're not buying the Sierra 213

character in the yeah this is a

different this is my codex mortis not

the codex more distanced Ronald's

followers my codings mortis is better it

summons master versions of ladies organ

and also has the ritual desecration was

she tried to use to get no use the weak

one anyway man let's get letter suggests

scouting it out but I guess that would

that's what we're doing that's so like

we're gonna case it and then I think

we'll be able to get some Intel about

the place to help us maybe the blueprint

or something like that oh we're going to

we're going to Valletta right now no no

the angel we're just making the decision

to instruct angel and what to do once he

gets done with the broadsheets thing

okay right a cool house now right yeah

so that's how you were saying we weren't

going to the courthouse we're going to

there hello we'd like to take a look

around where if this said the inspection

we have we have this rod go fight you in

your own house well just need one we're

only fighting one yeah there's one thing

to consider is that they're probably

very magical mm-hmm you know what I mean

like a lot of higher level and Ed's know

the words why I like screwed yeah that's

true

we should if if we're gonna go for the

undead's we might want to seriously talk

about somebody be rolling a cleric yeah

a stealth clean my bar that I've rolled

has some pretty cool stuff as far as

like you skating like things like

scrying stuff wherever the cases and so

as you guys the next morning as you

folks make your way through

the purses to get to the courthouse

based on Winchester Spanish directions

the courthouse is a relatively small

building and it looks almost like an old

Roman temple it's got a lot of like

columns and stuff like that but inside

there is a building with walls and it's

decorated in the old Caelian style which

looks much like the modern Commonwealth

which is to say greco-roman and it's

it's the marble is all old and hasn't

been cleaned you can see marks where

rain has has fallen for you know decades

if not centuries and inside there's no

trash or anything it's been cleaned out

but there's also no like furnishings or

anything yet and zeorge

and Winchester Spencer have decreed

that's the end of the way there used to

be all like counters and stuff here but

they're also doors going further we

discussed bringing they came on their

own yeah they already thought what they

were gonna bring some people well yeah

as you guys are walking down the street

to get here you see there are a bunch of

kind of lounging around it's early it's

relatively early morning I have no idea

what time you folks are playing on set

out but it was probably around like 8

o'clock when ladies organ confronted

when she started the clock right if

she's being punctual and so it's yeah I

around that time the traffic in the

street is picking up but there's an

awful lot of Knights of the word kind of

just lounging around waiting to see

what's gonna happen okay

and they don't look like they don't seem

worried almost as though no one's told

them what they're doing here yes yeah

selling my am yeah can be fun do you

folks want no I'm there right anyway

what it's up to you there your troops

you which one what about the ones that

don't they like we have a seven of them

I don't think I have stats for the

advancers okay only got stats about unit

so I'm gonna decide we need to save our

tree yeah we need to repeal it like

that's good point you we don't need to

get them diminished and turned into

undead here and then it out steady let's

some willing to bet that night throws

some sort of nuke out cause a bunch of

them goes rise and rise my you should be

a dungeon master that's some dope show

[Laughter]

if you just wanted to be combat which

are this shirley chisholm is that it's

going so yeah are you guys in the room

pretty songs in there enter it I guess

we'd go over to woods right yeah so

anybody have that exploding Bluffs phone

put in front of the door so she walks in

yeah just a front this is the door the

door those doors on the way that's the

way hmm

yeah cuz she's definitely taking spells

to fight you guys alright she doesn't

know she come from why she thinks she's

gonna get the artifacts in [ __ ] off

phone well that's what lady valid is

hoping

ladies organ hopes that you don't have

it and there she gets tomorrow okay

we're just getting ready for battle here

yeah but they might not be about what

you guys might negotiate or something I

don't know hmm or something mm-hmm get

that road out get enough Sun go home

whip it out

where's my yeah this must be super

interesting to watch eight hours that's

not as a ritual no then go in now it

bounced off fought for it what a wanker

nothing personal

you just got massive for it silence oh

that's bad I am I I always have silence

okay I'm gonna drop this bells get would

do on this I've also got I've just fell

magic and I also bet that lets me do

like shoot

I have shoot arrow shoot arrow mark and

claw claw bite tentacle painful

switchblade gun yeah I could take

animate dead turn corpses into 1 plus 2

per spell level skeletons are zombies 24

hours we can basically slow something

down or let's stop them no hats yeah

turn corpses so when the word it's it

you can raise the undead police I'm dead

cops late and then you could just come

on them anyway for 24 hours to live

forever with your

blimey anyway alright yeah George is

surprised to see you know right now

wait wait wait was Mason huh no far as

you know know something that he brought

up with you guys not masa hmm well

swords like you said if we're gonna

carry these seals around by the gods

that's what I like to hear

fight to the death well show her she can

boss around that's the spirit yes

boots likes this guy because he speaks

in a yell at all times tell you it's a

secret somehow he's always next to a

table - yes no he does yeah so you peace

he said what are you doing here and

you're like no we're here to you we say

we're here because I can't that's it

and yeah when you when you say that

spendthrift who's got his he's taking

notes as he always does he's like

looking goes yeah that's why is this

paper sticking away this paper

oh I see fridge magnets business exactly

sighs papers it just may exactly well at

none of you are able to tell time this

precisely but what appears to be exactly

24 hours

I think I wanted to do a quick Audrey is

there any spells you folks would like to

cast before the arrival of some number

of death Knights a natural number and

out of the greater than zero

lasts less than 12 I'm gonna cast death

before dawn myself what does death war

do creature drops to zero hip points it

drops the one instead or negates first

instantaneous kill effect because she

has an ability called instantaneous

Killa fast can only be negated by death

works

yeah that's [ __ ] cool Oh many good

necromancer is Dan Bookman says

necromancer's are just clerics of bad

timing spikes okay so yeah King casts

death Ward on himself not anybody else

cuz [ __ ] it ready else we can revive

people dummy I can revive people - is

anybody else gonna be casting any spells

on themselves or anybody else I'm gonna

worry about haste or anything like that

yeah I'm why wait - that's when haste

when haste is over it becomes slow yeah

yeah like he has to pay quite basic

mhm don't forget your commander ability

no what is it

you cans a bonus action you can give

slim an extra attack oh this you can do

it anybody but no is this still a thing

you can inspire um no because she's not

brain it's not this isn't one

organization thing as enough gosh if

this was if ladies organ was if she

really was bringing a whole unit of

death Knights yes squad what if she was

being old squad a death Knights

absolutely you could do that so the

question I ask is if we use the wrong

one glowers uh-huh if the chain of

macron

uses the rod of count rod our von glower

let in anyway or in the

or what like like physically abuses it

like well like moldy alchemy for boots

because we've never used it before right

so we don't harbor sent know if it's

gonna like vampire him or something like

that and so I want to well what would in

as in judges mind what would a boot a

bad outcome be a bad outcome would be

I think boots no longer being capable of

putting the chain first mm-hmm that

makes sense

let me read the Audrey spell okay we

lower rapid I need the MS I know what

the I know the answers are I need to

understand more about des NBA players

yeah wheel whoa or what Neptune strike

you dead Winslow yes apparently I

mentioned this by the way it's described

as a dark comedy ya know I'm the first

half is actually really funny I'm Klan

back leg it gets [ __ ] weirder pal I

didn't think either those trailers

seemed particularly spooky I just really

want to know what happens I just wanna

know what was going on that lighthouse

[Laughter]

too that's how they got no way I'm

anyway go ahead and do you think like

judge probably knows how Audrey works oh

I'm sure he does

doesn't make any sense then let me know

no be like you have to know it's

basically what's gonna happen within the

next half hour and so in the next half

hour there's something bad gonna happen

to boots of boots you right cuz they

come it doesn't take that long right so

we're gonna use it it's gonna be within

the next half hour partly and then it

was like but it it also mentions that

like these might have spells were used

my

I can obviously change outcomes sure but

I'm asking specifically like I

understand now I already knew what you

were asking with yeah you explained what

you were gonna ask I just need to know

how Audrey works now I do now I know

I'll just wait Mongoose pedal or wheel

and hopefully you now know the

difference between or neither ah

Oh a texan pray i'm for you good gay or

evil gay

ixnay oh okay I'm gonna cast protection

from evil and good on you

which Sugar Creek is off normally until

the spill ends one willing creature you

touch is protected against certain types

of creatures and I'm going to choose

undead the protection grants several

benefits the creatures those types have

disadvantaged on attack roles against

the target the target also can't be

charmed frightened or possessed by them

what what few people know is that ladies

organ is actually gelatinous she's very

dead she's not dead she's dead for 10

minutes you're gonna consult the the car

okay well in this in this case the snake

represents birth and renewal because the

shakes the snake sheds its skin and

that's the cards telling you that it'll

probably be fine it'll probably work we

yeah we all like it if you hear the if

you're familiar with the term

Commonwealth like the Commonwealth of

Virginia

no common health

[Music]

oh man well yeah cool boots whoo boots

become a vampire all right all right I

get it it's just it's it's uh why is he

still in service in the chain for

somebody like judge it's a symbol of

renewal and rebirth it's a good thing

it's not a sinister thing it's well I

know Asmodeus has different ideas about

well there's a vampire good you need

some okay it's not okay you compare so

you see the complementary coffin is that

how it works we get you a bigger pair of

solving both beyond count do has a nice

yeah there's a deal word ale deal its

deal yeah the appointed time cigars of

all cast our spells and da Noya rituals

and you've talked to Asmodeus and

Asmodeus has given you the answer that

is technically correct and therefore the

best kind of correct ah protection from

evil and death ward hang on to him for

for my sword bard things which is why as

a bard I don't are we gonna try and talk

to him first talk to her first

yes yeah okay yeah if you can talk to

her for at least a minute I can do

something cool I'll see what I can do

yeah no your enemy if you spend at least

one minute observing or interacting with

another creature outside combat you can

learn information about its capabilities

compared to your own strength toward

x-score comScore armor class current hit

points total class levels etc nice well

this is the opportunity runner

[ __ ] anyway [ __ ] but she's big good as

you are as judge and George are talking

about what the outcome of what that

little card thing was you were doing

this this suit on the ground starts to

kind of like dance and vibrate it can

then manifest into ladies organ sounds

like turn me the [ __ ] around and ladies

organ appears in her finery she was in

life a queen of the goal which means if

she wasn't dead she would look like kind

of a conan type character she still has

long black hair under her helmet but now

her once dusky olive skin is pale white

and she just can't actually scares the

[ __ ] out because orange is not the

[ __ ] south all mercenary he's a cop

and and she says the rod oh now she

knows it's a rope did she just do that

and he's just gonna try to stonewall

yeah he's like you know listen here like

you know and he invokes her master lady

Valletta because he's learned who she

works for

and he's just gonna like a berate her

it's not gonna last a minute and she

reaches out her hand like she's gonna

she's either I'm gonna put the rod in it

or she's gonna do something to this guy

step back yeah like George doesn't step

back - George I'm gonna move I'm gonna

stand next to I'm stand next to friend

of mine just once when I broke when I

accidentally broke one of his many s was

like they're meant to be played with the

end of the day you can repaint them you

can anyway I'm gonna say ladies organ I

don't know who you are where you're from

but in this the greatest city of this or

any age you can't just expect to come

down to a free part of the city

threaten a civil servant with death on

some cockamamie errand and not expect

consequences if you were to say deliver

a message to lady Valletta we could

perhaps do this on more amicable terms

but I'm afraid we have to ask you to

leave

this courthouse I don't to be sort of

like casually jingling my princess seal

at her leave this courthouse and the set

of dimensions please leave this manifold

so like if this were a negotiation I

would say okay well you don't make a

role you give a little speech make a

role but unfortunately like she's not

actually empowered to do anything

although it doesn't seem like it I'm

kind of distracted by it more time yeah

well okay okay so what she says what she

says in response to were you she listens

to you

and and you can hear this sepulchral

echoing breathing as though like wind is

blowing through a deep cave and she when

you invoke Lady Valletta and say go back

and talk to her and this and the other

thing she her eyes flash red and she

says the book commands me I must obey

and what you can do is you can make a

I'm sorry what are the skills in a fifth

edition diplomacy is not one of them

persuasion personally yeah you can make

a persuasion check - actually I don't

think it's persuasion because she can't

be persuaded but your boots so hmm I

need persuades or it could be a couple

steps back it could be a performance

check to see if you can keep her talking

long enough or see if you can verbally

dance around uh only a twenty six

just man you got robbed better than that

not even just bard

so 60 seconds is a long time but she

showed up she demanded the rod zeorge

babbled at her in his in dwarf for a

little while I'm also going to can I

like wall I'm talking to her sort of

like kind of subtly push zeorge behind

me I mean you'd have to make you'd have

to make like an attacker all our

strength something because he's a

[ __ ] dwarf okay he's not like it he's

not he's not a 7th of mercenary but he's

an incredibly stubborn

dwarf that's kind of what spendthrift

was trying to tell you guys he's not

gonna back down for any reason like it

would not bother him at all like to die

in the glorious service of the city and

be remembered by all of his descendants

because I guess I would try to like sort

of and he would just kind of while he's

doing this and I just I just would be

like George a word I don't know that

that would do it like he's he's she's

confronting him remember she's not in

front of you guys she's in words or jizz

no no no I'm just I'm standing there

doing my thing trying to figure out that

you know whatever we want to know about

this guy out of this list but you know

with his or just standing there I'm just

wondering if like I would say hey can I

talk to you for a minute right if that

would move to have him walk over to me

for a second I mean he's he's basically

ready for battle he's not hit this he's

he's waiting for he's not gonna he's

just gonna ignore me yeah he thinks you

said the word and he calls them all into

compliance like a word like he's gonna

he's gonna ignore you because he's in

he's in battle mode basically but but

boots is able to keep ladies organ

talking for a minute with his with his

remarkable repartee right what do you

guys want to know strength any of the

strength decks con armor class hit

points maybe that total class levels if

any well right now it's a doesn't have a

possible so don't bother

like and we can find out the AC within a

real phone if HP is what's gonna take us

all the way to the end to find out oh

yeah that's true

good boy okay let's find out well if you

guys have any like string critical spell

AC we're like the whole thing the whole

this whole battle depends on this spell

working and that spell has a saving

throw then you might want to know that

is right if it's like a Christmas Eve I

don't I actually don't know if you have

any spells like that I'm just letting

you know I just strength Dexcom there's

no not not in Wizard well no if you

observe it stuff you'd be like oh yeah

oh god [ __ ] when I did when I was

playing Winchester Spencer if there was

gonna be down on my knees I'm just at my

ass next time yeah hopefully he gets so

me the only spell thing we need to know

probably is charisma but she's an undead

death knight she probably know a lot of

charisma I mean I guess they can be

forcible I can't find that out in yeah I

think hip points no all right what's

right hip points well just out of

curiosity how would would you guess I

guess 180 I would say that's exactly how

my hip wash it says Jerry says know your

enemy only tells you the value relative

to your own like higher lower equal yeah

okay so come about compared to you

strength Dex con armor class current hit

points right does she have more like

what read the whole thing total class

levels if no what is what is the ability

if you spend at least one minute

observing or interacting with another

creature outside combat you can learn

information about its capabilities

compared to your own strength it

compared compared to yours is she

stronger than me yes oh that sounds

points less cool than yeah like having

already told you how many hit points she

has even if I hadn't done

I would probably do it anyway because

that does some kind of [ __ ] it's kind

of like how like my friends and I when

we were even in we're kids we knew that

the Paladins detect lineman ability

didn't work the way we were playing it

we just thought the way that it worked

was dumb and so we thought it was cooler

to play it as it lay so yeah I think it

would be pretty useless to be like yes

this thing has more hit points than you

what does that [ __ ] mean by more 100

more all right well so yeah it shows 180

it's just exactly an idiot points in

case you don't me I doubt it not I don't

doubt you sure I have seen it with my

own twice

yeah 19d 8 + 95 which means she is

technically the equivalent of my 19th of

a character yeah actually scram

hey we juggle with you yes watch Raiders

we don't deal with traitors oh yeah

because you guys don't give the rock

right you guys know no one gets the rod

we're just going for it well I mean this

is like boot boots was able to keep her

talking long enough that what's the only

thing that the role was for right is

initiatives gonna happen can boots keep

her talking long enough to alright delay

it for your ability to okay that was

interesting okay well where our king 606

is pretty low didn't do that if you had

there yeah you're not gonna win any

fights with those autumn initiative

rocks well I mean it's probably better

than I go later because I know you used

to be your old man you guys were you

guys work uh

[ __ ] to each other and it not only was

it you world initiative every round so

that which meant that was much cooler

and more important like you could go

suddenly like do we win initiative this

round made sense

this way it only matters for the first

round and then after that it's just a

sign right there's no longer after that

and also it was year old initiative on a

team basis like yeah if you if you one

initiative you all went you all went and

then all the bad guys went and then and

then when that one guy who rolled for

your initiative you change initiative or

all bad 2424 no clear good I mean slim

seventeen how come slim doesn't have a

cool little picture like everybody else

does same question for but also got 24

didn't have official arm only leach 1717

is for the same is slim my decks is 14

years

why is your deck

why is your decks 18 which ever is gonna

plus 2 oh yeah what's your charisma 19

Oh as long as it's not as long as you

input your wrong stat

where's judge where's judges do you see

it out there in yellow right there

oh yeah your judge I love interesting

what's your dexterity

[Music]

oh okay that's good that means you go

before these work right

Oregon good to know yeah so ladies

organs her sword

it is wreathed in ultraviolet energy and

she's about to attack oh all right

she's gonna tax or just what she's gonna

do new folks are whatever oh she can

still burn his brains out that's correct

all right Bobby a one eight joke yeah

dang we need to get him what is the best

night but a miserable pile of armor

enough talk how about you I'm going to

dirt around so that I have Intel that is

a I told you I went to I was standing

line at Whole Foods and I was wearing my

Newark shirt and this young lady was

just walking over so she saw someone

walk past me as I'm staying away and she

look at my shirt with her face like 21

to hit actually alright that is a so 14

damage on the first attack hang on a

second that's never good the lady's not

legendary actions you can only do three

times she can do this almost as often

she want she Perry is your attack it's a

huge massive

two-handed black great sort those moves

it moves as quickly as your rapier does

and she carries your attack what does

that mean it means that as a reaction

increases our armor class by six and you

didn't hit an AC 26 is like almost every

time you said she can do this a reaction

show she can't do it again until her

next turn yeah okay so see she's used it

for all for the

turn right but once King goes then she

can do that again so this actually is

almost certainly not the most tactically

and this is me giving you folks break

cuz she doesn't know what you can do

like if she knew what you could do she

would he use it against slim cuz I can

cut her head off

cuz now I can't use this third attack

right that's true but I like I like

playing my bad guys trying to use only

the information they would reasonably

know and they do not reasonably know

what you guys can do wait so is it well

I wouldn't know that so well let me

first

I guess one melee attack okay so if you

want attack again you may all right yeah

well her AC is now back down to some

still quite high but less than twenty

one value okay um let me think for a

second I'm excited for look now that I

know that you guys are gonna rob house

below yeah yeah

can anyone scoot back over here exact

again gonna be fun when Ron Joe hits to

get yeah yeah the infiltrators then all

right 23 by the way everyone's undead

everybody's alright so that is 10 damage

14 damage and she gets pushed visit 10

and 14 or at 14 just 14 or did she get

14 damage and I pushed her away from

George and indeed from myself

and I'm gonna use the I'm gonna use the

rest of my movement to box Rin okay

that's cool that's cool if I was worried

I wasn't gonna be able to yeah

copper big cat be effectively find a way

to do be effective try to do would try

to do him I would see yeah you guys need

to do 40 50 points sandwich on your turn

everything could be fine yeah bill over

in it for total ting I think I'm gonna

set a nothing I often reveal to the

players elements of the Monster Manual

stat block not because they would know

it because I think it's traumatic okay

hunter smart when do you think

did you hit no I'm just saw again so in

this section I'm gonna put the mark on

her and then now will awareness 20 no

that's not funny it's 13 I'm in 30

minutes crap and then big cat will

attack you roll both your attacks oh you

are f - yeah sorry okay sorry I didn't

have a similar spell that from a

celestial point of view 15 damage

anything sweet like you track out well

well yeah I mean yeah if you wanna know

so you guys know how many hit points you

have and if you all tell you about how

much you've done okay there's no reason

I mean I'm doing math already and you

know you guys are done yeah because that

big cat whoa ah yeah

I got Vince to be tiny cats playmate and

they hate each other

hi Gigi 21 hits yeah oh yeah Vince is

just a [ __ ] terror unconvince liked

tiny cat bird well Vince writes Vince

likes everybody just her hanging time

cat and tiny cats like god damn it

[ __ ] stops right and so tiny cat has

to go find a forget a tiny cat like a a

box so that she can have her own space

that Vince can't get into because right

now what she does is hides a little

cubby also stuff anyway I'm sorry no 11

dammit no it's the thing about big 10 11

damage so yeah that's exactly negative

you had done exactly 40 damage yeah we

got if there were one two three four

there were six more people going before

lady zorga that you'd be fine leech I'm

gonna move he's tiny right he doesn't

technically pick up a sweat shirt right

so let's say he's there which I think

gives me advantage right sure yeah you

can have him you can have them uses

action hell yeah then we can assume that

he's really hurt that seems advantage is

pretty easy to get using these optional

rules so what 20 did you an actual next

step

this is elders blast passing out double

your damage damage on that one okay

mister double damage on eight possible

1224 yeah oh sorry

okay 18 five so was that 29 what do you

know I need to say you're all the dice

twice but you do the math once so if you

have a bonus like +5 you had that once

so it's like a plus by this 29:29 you

get 24 so you've got you've done 69

damaged that wasn't one blast after one

that was [ __ ] amazing

no obviously this is your patron who is

if she's if your patrons opposed to

anyone it's right in ladies organ so not

the the celestial beam of energy that

eat that ejaculates from your fingertips

[Music]

it is it seems empowered it glows and it

casts ladies organs pale face in this

ethereal blue light alright cuz my

second blast did vomit 19 miss oh okay

Wow and I moved back already

I am done that was bleach slim she has a

head slim yeah yep she used her parry

yeah this is this is she probably next

time this scenario happens she will have

saved her parry just because of your

[ __ ] evil sword I know the cat's

already gone um in combat there's like a

thing that I would like to try and do or

to optimize like is this something like

a suggestion I can like kind of like

shout out in combat even though it's not

yet judge's turn I don't know what

you're talking about

like for instance if I wanted to ask

copper to like move big cat to the sides

that you have to wait til your turn to

talk or in Spanish I apologize

what do they want to do well I was

thinking of you if you turn big cat it

means that somebody else can also get

I'm going to use one of my superiority

dice to do it last he goes last

distracting strike I'm not expecting him

to live and spend yeah I don't know if

they're gonna do anything I mean they'll

do some I don't know if it'll be

effective but considering this is

something above they're a little bit

about that pay grade 23:23 hits

yeah nice yeah yeah yeah I mean I

suppose I could just do this a baby

already died next slide you circus

I do that this act 27 damage was for

that one

it was only one person that goes after

between slimmin ladies yeah so I'm gonna

use my action surge I'm not cool to get

an additional action that I'm like this

is gonna be a very swingy swinging about

she's she's she's not she's inspiration

her category is not humanoid that's like

elves and dwarves and humans her

category is Undead

it's it's annoying because humanoid

she's definitely humanoid in that six

she has two arms and two legs and

bilateral symmetry and a torso a net

right but she's not a human either

snores the shy right to try and get that

up higher is protected from intense yes

twenty a C 20 hits in fact a C 20 his

former class yeah now we know certain

skills under anyone's a can trip that's

not a can trip the plans going to do

that too and then I'm like wait a minute

you can't do that oh that's right yeah

35 so wait you get another back yeah I

took I took my action surge to give me

another action and get two attacks per

action you can double-check to make sure

that's the case so this is for tax right

now normal yeah yeah how much did you

have yeah we could do something that how

much how much damage did you just do 35

[Applause]

and it's amiss brings up inspiration

this is like vanish yeah so oh I thought

it's a rewrote nevermind

and I'm not gonna use any superior

diagnosis that was anyway - - you have

to use it I'm really seriously rooting

for you folks normally I want my bad

guys to live but if that happens this is

gonna be a very sweet very swinging

combat and so it's judge it's your turn

you have advantage judge you can do 16

points of damage

- ladies organ how much 16 16 you guys

are doing 164 points of damage crosses

lines

it's my slim I use my precision strike

[Applause]

still that's yep yeah she's 12

yeah 32 dem 32 means of 180 hits you've

done a hundred and ninety six slim

attacks with his yeah and you hit I

think three hit four doors yes and each

time he swings and hits ladies organ

the vorpal blade that he uses digs right

through it's a slices right through her

silver armor until the final blow

cuts through her torso and this

ultraviolet light erupts out of her body

and she detonates and there's an

explosion of necromantic energy and

plays organ is no no it's purely nervous

yes this is judges courtroom excluded

all the work but yes I great and

afterwards there's like silence right

and your ears are ringing it's not from

the explosion but from the sounds of

Slim's blades slamming into lady's

organs armor over and over again

it's howl of combat rage and yeah zeorge

points to where she had been standing

and and that's that's yeah lady ladies

which folks know I was using like ladies

organ and strongholds and followers is

CR 13 I started if I like CR 13 would be

a little bit too easy for you people so

I was using the actual legit stats for

an actual death thing which is badass

which once per day they get hellfire orb

make a DC 18 dexterity save or take 75

points of damage

oh we would have all done Wow well it

might not be 75 it's 20 d6 and it's more

it's a 20-foot radius sphere so so yes

somewhat anticlimactic but pretty epic

pretty epic ridiculous damage but this

is what happens yeah this is the

judge and this is his chain ascendant so

yeah George is in your debt and he owes

your life debt and he's a door so he'll

pay it and now you see what we can do

yes you guys could conquer the city he

might he might I'm gonna turn to drift

and say write that down he's kind of

stunned yeah but he absolutely makes

note of what happened and members of the

word like show up and they look in to

see what's happening all they see is you

guys again it's already over it's

already over and George is eager to in a

very you know you could see the the

Heritage his dormant heritage kind of

coming to the fore as he wants to tell

the tale like a dwarven epic of what

happened when ladies org and cross

swords with slim the pilot of the chain

of Acheron and and yeah that's that's

they are the the it's obvious that the

soldiers of the word had no idea that

ladies organ had even shown up we're

done any of this spendthrift had kept it

all under his hat is there anything left

of her no like no total protonic

reversal so like yeah one two three four

sentence all of her armor and stuff get

went away as well like she didn't I

would say yes she's a summon creature

effectively what you did because you

can't kill her what you did was you

banished her right you or you annihilate

her corporeal form which means she's

gonna reform on you know in some

probably technically in the book right

and in 30 days the book will recharge

and saver yeah correct yeah now that you

knows what you can do yeah

so the 30-day clock is now ticking and

that's not the only I think there's

another 30-day clock you guys are under

as well if you remember yeah so having

decided it's almost exactly 10 o'clock

having decided to target lady house

Valletta literally the estate of house

Valletta castle Valletta yeah have angel

make a espionage check to see how good

his Intel will be and this is going to

determine like like how much detail you

get regarding the estate that you're

about to Burkle and how accurate that

detail is yeah is there anything that he

can use to well he's already you guys

already know things that you use are you

pay for you have a establishment for a

base which you do it's a sausage shop

and you have a can use inspiration for

this yeah it's you're the head of the

spy organization angels your agent your

website because people been at people

have seen me flipping these and they're

like those coins are [ __ ] cool I like

it just sitting here as paper weights to

hold your battle mat down but they're

just like the stuff we say here by the

way

HR plus 5 right huh yeah you get

proficiency plus 2 from the organization

right you you get proficient you get to

add your proficiency bonus

yeah and it's which is I think plus 3

correct yeah yeah so yeah it's a 16 so

ok so next week angel will debrief the

what's you guys need to come up with a

cool name infiltrator see infiltrators I

don't know

I gotta think of a cool name for this

this team but next week we will begin

well but presuming that in the next week

I have time to get the heist ready I'm
