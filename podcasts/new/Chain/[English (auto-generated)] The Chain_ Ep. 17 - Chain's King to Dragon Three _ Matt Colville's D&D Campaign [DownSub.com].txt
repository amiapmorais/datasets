seven factions vie for control over the

city of Capitol open war is inevitable

but each faction wants the war on their

terms so for now they maneuver their

pieces if the war of spies fought in

shadows until the arrival of a legendary

mercenary company beaten diminished

they're outnumbered and outmatched

forced to rely on tricks and schemes and

dirty fighting situation normal for the

chain of Acheron now five factions

converge on the dead princes territory

each convinced the others are trying to

take it for themselves the city of

capital is about to explode

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

welcome to the show everybody thanks for

tuning in thanks for spending your time

with us my name is Matt Koval these are

my video game developer friends and I

hopefully we don't have to recap what

are you guys all watch the campaign

diary right of course you did yes

looking at chat and it says yes awesome

from where we left off you folks are

deep underground in the mausoleum of

House Sebelius and I believe the last

thing that happened was you folks were

in the process of sending messages via

diplomatic pouch to your head spy angel

and in fact I believe the chat does not

know that you have since sent more

messages to Angel and Angel has replied

is that correct yeah yeah what would the

message like at lunch like we had a D&D

lunch yeah and you said to Angel hey do

this and do that what did you tell what

what did you tell usual we told angel to

leak that the 12 dragons are coming to

take the library the order of 12 dragons

are supposedly on their way to stop you

folks from from taking the island on

behalf of the fulcrum but that's

something that would also look like them

coming to attack so we're trying to get

other people involved to hopefully delay

them right that was your one of the

things that you folks in chat we have

our own top secret chat that no one else

can see the you folks in chat said hey

hang on a minute

if these Knights if these badass Knights

are coming to this island because they

think we are trying to take the island

on behalf the fulcrum doesn't that look

like them coming to take the island on

behalf of them like what would be the

difference between them coming to stop

us and them coming to actually do it and

aren't there other factions that would

want to stop them from taking the

princes kind of be more believable that

they would be trying to take you guys a

crime that could seem reasonable to me

so you're like you said you send a

message message to angel saying hey can

you let people know can you get the word

out that this is going down and see if

there if if there's anything anyone that

cares about this and wants to come out

this out

and did you ask him anything else yeah

we asked for a fake contract saying that

the job was to come get the kid not to

get the paper right so he was that as a

you have recovered the official city

document that says the prince 300 years

ago the Prince gave administration of

the pallet taos community so you guys

actually don't have that contract right

now like you put it in the diplomatic

pouch and angels got it yeah and angels

response was holy [ __ ]

along with the thing that we were

supposed to get to the contract steel

itself that is that I mean the the

document is the telling sense again and

so you have asked him for a fake

contract a fake job like we weren't we

weren't hired to steal this document we

were hired to recover the courier The

Lost courier and look here is good job

yeah that all seems entirely plausible

and not at all ridiculous yeah small

tangent what are the limitations of The

Diplomats pouch like how much stuff can

you put in there and how big is stuff

can you put in there I can put letters

addressed to other people that have

diplomats badges yeah but you put a

letter in there and you address it to

somebody and if that person has a

diplomatic pouch that letter goes point

and it disappears and they end up with

that letter so you couldn't put like

money in there that's why I was asking

it you can just do a note like a dollar

bill or whatever I just imagined us like

if we were about to get caught weapons

we're all like shoving our weapons like

you guys have a you have a bag holder

it's not it's not technically not on you

right right it would still be on you

quote-unquote you could probably you can

maybe test this out you could write a

letter on a banknote hmm right and then

that note would go but if you drop

unless you did that in a hundred times

then what a really big bank note

together stickies and everything they do

everything with paper here so you folks

are so yeah you're you're as you are

discussing this and trying to figure out

what your plan is down here in this

incredibly cold dark mausoleum

surrounded by grey stone dust of

centuries on the floor around

you there's I think up dead black

pudding around here somewhere there's a

bunch of very slowly right again trying

to find you away from it 15 feet or

something

you folks are writing letters to Angel

and discussing what are we going to do

because angel says they're coming to get

you and then you were like yeah an

Angels response was stop stop so after

probably depending on how long you guys

stay down here like if you're gonna wait

for the diplomats ouch then it's

probably gonna be 10 or 15 minutes where

you're pointing Dodie like it was we

were gonna send out we're gonna send him

out out of the mausoleum and just

probably through the library to the

front of the library and sort of look

around there and see if what is Odie's

strength give you a card I have I did I

thought six six hmm okay so yes you

folks watch as leash his eyes kind of

roll in the back of his head I put

things on me this time silly creature I

have no idea what you're talking about

[Laughter]

Odie is he I assume there's a standard

operating procedures on things you've

done before we had you're gonna make

sure he's invisible yeah I'm not the

kind of demon be like ah you didn't say

this time so where you can see him so

yeah Odie flies through the mausoleum

that you guys are in the Mazda for how

Sibelius flies up the stairs to the

landing where there's all these

branching corridors going down here and

then up those stairs to the large metal

bulkhead which is closed

oh right but I it's not locked

they didn't lock your date and lock you

down here that would be crazy uh

you are if you wait you see Odie very

slowly opening this huge bulkhead it's a

normal size doors is very large and

heavy very thick and all these heavy

mechanisms that make it so the crazy

undead things live down here cannot

infest the library proper Odie opens the

door and flies out and and should I take

you outside and tell you what he says

and then you can tell everybody else or

should I just tell you here I'm trying

to think of how dramatic it is yeah so

you see the library now you folks have

been down here at least for a couple of

hours none taken

- I believe short rests you haven't

taken a long rest correct and which

means that you folks would have Spectre

or damage and boudic damage you still

are that reduced hit points correct and

the library is now empty still lit but

there is nobody in it okay and as OD

flies and you here I assume yeah well

here leach even though you can't even

though his eyes are old and Magnus said

he's describing what OD is seeing he

flies like he's gonna leave for the

library and you see the librarian is

talking to these gentlemen men and women

dressed in red armor they have these

smooth helmets on there obviously

Knights you recognize them they're the

red Falcons you've seen several of them

on the way into the library they're at

the city guard their ailments are these

smooth red helmets that have stylized

feathers in them like carved into the

helmets they're not there's no plumage

and the helmet and there's looks like

half a dozen of them talking to the

librarian and you recognize it's the

same librarian got you down here yeah oh

yeah I can communicate go a little

closer and listen to what they're saying

they are asking to for

instead of the library they want to

search the place they were looking for

the chain of macro and she's saying like

is that a book is that what like uh

maybe I could maybe if you write your

requests down on a piece of paper I can

go looking up for you

she's cause she's strolling him indeed

she just know that I don't think we ever

said who we were

yeah never once did we maybe no document

to her yeah we do showed her the

reference number yeah we shouted a

number for sure

cuz we like can you just get this first

and yes you see a couple of people with

like large hastily assembled stacks of

books or collections of papers kind of

scurrying out like trying to get out of

Dodge before anything crazy happens

because there's an order of knights the

red Falcon specifically that are sort of

investing in the library right now so we

don't get out of here without going past

these guys well but that may be no that

might not be a bad thing

right cuz we're gonna tell him about

they go spy name is we're gonna try and

bottom up a bit right right because this

is occasionally you guys have mostly

have it right most of the time but

occasionally there's some confusion

about them because there's all these new

people in terms we're talking about yeah

the red Falcons are the cities are the

islands guards right then the princes do

the princes men right men and women

right twelve dragons are the bad guys

well bad guys they're [ __ ] right

they are they are they are known they're

everything there everything your buddy

hates about knights and those are the

ones or those are on there whatever that

means whatever they yeah yeah right

let's have a dhoti fly outside your

library and see if anything's there you

see there's like a small crowd of people

gathering the library is on a slowly

sloping hill sparsely populated by trees

it's designed to be very to look pretty

and be like a park and there are people

kind of like what's going on and people

are slowly gathering and in in that

crowd you see one two red Falcons

joining like there's more coming okay no

sign of any I mean not that I probably

don't know what a lot

or OD right but no sign of anything that

looks like a whatever they call 12

dragon guys no okay no not unless

they're disguised as civilians okay but

there are red Falcons now guarding the

way the library on the inside on the

outside and I think this is a bad thing

I think this might be you see somebody

trying to leave the library with a big

sheaf of papers kind of stuffed into a

folder and the guard stopped them and

they show okay let's see you know what's

in here okay you can go so that that

just means we don't have what's honest

like when we came here to get it which

means that we have a kid though so

anything on end that could get us some

trouble like I think this is a good

opportunity for scale you get a your you

feel the shift in weight in The

Diplomats pouch alright I open up

there's a there is a a hastily composed

but authentic-looking

contract signed by the herald that

signed your last contract okay just

saying and it's literally the same text

as the previous contract you actually

did sign except instead of go find this

contract it says go find this career

okay so I think the stall was for that

or do you think the stall was for the

leak I don't know but I don't want to be

where the twelve Dragons think we are

yeah I'd rather just get going be

somewhere here yeah so we gotta talk to

these MA

so do we want to knock out the kid I

thought you could do something he does

the Commission judge can still hit

points from you can my Vulcan neck pinch

him

yes which may be sweet let him know is

that what you're saying no no if he's a

good liar like he's frightened

the lab let's not give anybody of

slow-like

listen grab yeah let's knock him out all

right sorry grumbles yeah yes yeah thank

you doing this for us

yeah thanks Jeff you seem to sleep do

you explain to him what the hell you're

doing no no okay do you know time okay

I know if you take so explain to me the

process here he's like he's like pretty

injured right so like aren't we he's not

injured he's just starting yeah he

doesn't everyone sorry oh I thought we

were like kind of hoping to walk him out

you could give him wounds that would be

in character

Chema's he's just really poorly off

because it's been like two weeks and he

hasn't any food and he's terrified

because he was hiding from my deck

in that case judge is gonna see you in a

state and I say in your state here let

me help you I'll help you walk out and

then so one of his arm over my shoulder

I put my arm over his shoulder and how

much how much how much of your like a

leech kind of thing which is on hands

which we can SAP oh it's not only can

she SAP cheek also transfer she can go

like Belson yeah and so she can brain in

any way she can in fact she can give you

temporary points with it

it's like Leon you know lay on hands but

instead of this many hit points it's

fewer hit points but instead of just

dealing it can steal and do all sorts of

you'll get the right back just that's a

cool use of the ability I like that kind

of like you know yeah he passes out

mm-hmm you know the limp you know of a

limp 15 year old career well we could

pave on the back of big cat you don't

mind not doing the cowboy Phil yeah

slinging because I'll just reach out

with this to me and put them on the back

I like you don't Yeah Yeah right

I'll call Audi back over okay

alright let's go talk to the Falcons

yeah yeah no that's so you exit the

mausoleum and return to the library is

sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 in the

afternoon the Sun is starting to get low

in the sky and there's a lot of this the

library is huge several stories tall

mostly empty on the inside and lots of

windows letting the light in and again

as you heard Leach described there's no

people in here it seems as though the

presence of the red Falcons has caused

them all to evacuate

yeah because they don't they don't know

what's gonna happen but I want to be

here when it does

they don't have in the paper tomorrow

and when you go to the foyer which is a

large room with lots of branching

offices and corridors that lead to the

rest of the library you see the

librarian is standing on top of that

huge granite counter and she's got her

rapier out oh my if she's pointing it at

the different members of the round

Falcons and they're kind of laughing and

holding their hands up and she says if

you have a request you'll have to fill

out the form on the yellow pad and

they're like come on come on like like

let's not let's doesn't have to get and

one of them reaches out to grab her

chill and likes dad like laughs at it

and then all the other red Falcons start

to like jeer at this guy and then you

folks show up and the red Falcons are

like they all as soon as you come into

view like the first one who sees you

folks nudges and they all point and now

they're not interested in librarian

anymore and and she sees you and says I

suppose you're the chain of macron

librarian son you know he never taught

they never proved anything yes we are we

are the Cheney back around these people

are here for you and the a woman in the

red Falcon livery she's heavily armored

she's more heavily armored than the

other ones she has

helmut under her arm she's kind of like

leaning on it a little bit and she has

long straight black hair says who

commands you me she points at the big

cat and says is that thing tame mm-hmm

trust me that comes it goes up I'm at

this point there's if you if you take

the time to count there's like 12 red

Falcons in here and you can see there's

a crowd of people outside the door and

they're all kind of watching and there's

also red Falcons outside kind of being

like library's closed

maybe you should post you go back to

your house your homes and the leader of

the red Falcons wants to talk to you

okay and what is your name King and you

command here yes what are you folks

doing here at the library checking the

book now we had a mission to come get

this kid which kid

I put the big cat and the kid courier

was sent here for something got lost

hasn't come back then we were sent to

pick him up she looks at all of you and

she says you know it's illegal to have

weapons here in the city you don't look

like Knights of the city

I think I'd recognize you we were given

temporary knighthoods and watch the

thing to come get the kid may I see that

sure do all of you have one of these

well if I'm being charitable then you've

been deceived in what way what do you

mean these are coins these are courier

badges oh wow well we wouldn't know that

we've only been here a few days

that explains like that look like the

kids I don't suppose you have proof that

you're here for the for the young man on

the cat well we have a copy of our

contract and I give her that she reads

it she says uh-huh and she hands it she

hands it to one of her people

and there was a course Arian looking

dude he's dressed as a rat Falcon

because dark black skin he's he reads it

and he hands it back to her and says

this seems to be this seems to be in

order she says I don't think the hell'd

roofers would try to deceive you and

she's like you know them and he's any

points of you guys and says not these

but we worked with the tower of disks

years ago and she says and what did you

learn about them he says the hell

troopers are brutal but honorable and

she said why were you hired

why were the why were the six of you

hired to recover one young man have you

been downstairs it's not a nice place

who hired you

the heraldic society which hare Aldridge

Society and then the guy the lieutenant

hands her the contract and she looks at

and she says the fulcrum hands you your

contract back what's the UH what's their

name that we have we've talked with the

role we're all name is it's a reasonable

response different layers and layers of

entry why did the fulcrum hire you

specifically she asked because they

needed this job done quickly there are

lots of certainly there are lots of

mercenaries they could have hired y-you

perfective

it is truly a very effective man as

evidenced by did we did collect the

courier in record time I think and now

that you've recovered him what do you

intend on doing with him and get him

some medical attention we have a medical

bay ownership mentorship surgeons here

she says give me a moment and she turns

and goes and confers with her lieutenant

and they have a little tete-a-tete mmm

conversation yeah okay I'm on the turf

that was like an argument and then you

know not not long goes by maybe like 90

90 seconds and she says all right well

well whatever you might have been up to

or why ever you were hired

you're not Knights you're not you're

very heavily armed for couriers so we

have a couple of options we could

obviously there's going to be a fine to

be paid but I don't think you folks

gonna have any problem paying it and you

can either come back to the station and

spend some time being questioned

or I could escort you off the island I

think we'll take the escort yeah if

that's an option

yeah we'll take it however I think we

should probably let her know about the

you know I mean let's uh see about this

angel said stall yeah she's gonna

probably take us the most direct route

and her reaction to these nights I don't

she's necessarily going to defer to them

but I don't know if they're gonna be

able to very easily get into their

station oh I see what you saying

so no paper in the station they might

not be out okay in there they also might

not know that we are in the station

they're gonna come to the library and

just be confused because we're not there

either and we're also not leaving

missions I'm just thinking you should

tell the command

of these of this army oh right that well

there's an invasion coming yeah but

honey there's a spy okay how about this

wool if you can pull her aside and

explain to her why we need to do this

job quickly we have spoken and tell Iran

a donation you feel a shift and the

diplomats vouchers away to call could be

that all right let's tell her that thing

and let's take the escort to the doors

to the docks yeah yeah angel says help

is on the way I called the ship yeah

that's true so I can't imagine that

takes that long for it to get here she

finishes conferring with her lieutenant

and she turns back round and she says

can I speak to you privately for a

moment uh can my lieutenant join us yeah

and she nods to her guy and two of them

and the two you just step away

the library is huge and empty there's

it's easy to find a echoey yeah here and

she says there isn't anything you won't

tell me is there before we get you off

the side go ahead yeah did a charismatic

one persuasive one uh commander

commander captain captain um he the

lieutenant introduces her all right and

says this is lady Antonia did this lady

Antonia d-day be Chen CICE enemy

everyone's constantly the engineer or

captain Antonia captain Antonia as they

call me boots I am lieutenant um she's

kind of like all right I didn't come up

the nickname but it's stuck yes anyway

as a as a group of mercenaries it uh it

hooves an operation such as ours to sort

of have years to the ground and we have

gotten word that Prospero Alvaro is

making a play for the pellet he's

sending the order to the twelfth dragons

here yeah so when you say Prospero

Alvaro is making a play for the pellet

her first reaction is not and then we

say he's sending 12 dragons that gets

her attention how reliable is this

intelligence chance to as far as I know

it's watertight problem is I don't want

to be here to find out how how correct

we are if we are well twelve dragons has

no jurisdiction here it seems unlikely

they would they would act on impulse

like that my inclination is to interpret

your message as being somewhat garbled I

think there's been a game of she

wouldn't say a telephone like but I

think something's been misinterpreted

along the way be that as it may I don't

think we want to take that chance

so if you don't mind we'll take that

escort she nods her lieutenant let

whispers in her ear and you can kinda

you see like she got sags and she puts

one hand on her on her sword like she's

like you have no designs like you didn't

come equipped in any way to take and

hold the library there was only six of

you I don't imagine that would have been

difficult don't up maybe not impossible

for you to do it I thought uh that's not

a job would be willing to take

it seems like suicide the library plus

we've been downstairs and even if it was

something that we were sent to take

somebody's got a real bad idea a place

to live the Foundation's all hike up

kilter

well puddings and cue Garland's the

faster we get you out of the city the

better so she turns and she says follow

me you're safe as long as you're with us

she says it's good to know so I can't

get but that book on displacer beasts

all right the library's still here next

week ok to the book and somebody to read

it to ya hoping there's lots of pictures

yeah so she hurt she kind of absolute on

the shoulder and he calls out to the red

dragons that he says right doc it's the

right move ahead pelicans I screwed it

up the Rena Elkins and he says Falcons

we are escorting these mercenaries off

the island and they start to they're

like ok great jobs over fantastic does

anybody look kind of surprised by the

information no no and so you walk

outside and there's a large crowd of

people that have gathered to see what

the heck is going on as soon as you guys

be merge the red Falcons are no big deal

they're from these points from their

point of view these are just cops but

you guys are crazy cuz that's a [ __ ]

gift that's a gobble in the writing and

displacer beast

that's a drow and that is a dude with

red skin and horns and so immediately

the crowd kind of silence falls over the

crowd they're like ah and you notice

someone is riding in a notebook no I'm

gonna yell out to the crowd worry not

everybody the boy is safe and he's in

our care and we will make sure that he

gets the medical attention that he needs

big cat pics

pick the boy up initialism you here you

like thank you people are now there's a

it's not quiet anymore people there's

they kind of surged forward because they

want to see they want to get a closer

look at UFO kumin nature something

terrible's happening quick let's get

closer they they want to get they want

to get a good look at you folks and the

red Falcons kind of keep them back and a

lot of the red Falcons that are out here

have bikes they're their pikemen the

ones you folks are talking to well are

better outfitted the other ones you see

out here they're all wearing like swords

and you hear someone call out and say

look and in the sky you see what looks

like a bird kind of descending and like

you know those how ducks and fly and

this V formation and that's that's what

it looks like it looks like there's

several of them but they're not Birds

one of them is much larger than the

others the lead lead flying thing and

you see 12 mounted Knights the first one

who lands in this on this hill

in front of you between you and the

crowd is riding a blue dragon and the

other ones are riding Griffin's and they

stop and dismount and lady Antonia says

[Music]

let me do the talking sounds good and

this ridiculously dressed he like he's

got his please wearing plate mail and

then plate mail is ornately carved it's

polished he's got this crazy helmet with

plumage coming off of it there's a lot

of dragon iconography on the helmets he

takes his helmet off and he has this

long curly brown hair quaffed and the

ryeowon style that cascades down his

shoulders

and he's got that puts his gear on his

dragon and all of his Knights who are

all wearing similarly style but they're

all in different colors right one of

them's the lead guys his his armor is I

got blue enamel all over it it says

bright blue color and the one of them's

green and one of those red the other

ones are all on Griffins and they

dismount and the dragon kind of you know

sits upright and the other the Griffins

all kind of like hide behind it like

it's like it's in charge of the flying

animals and these 12 Knights walk up to

you and the lead no approach approach

the 12 Dragons were there there's you

know at this point if you look around

there are dozens of red Falcons

in the area there's the the ten who were

guarding you folks and then just all

these cops and slowly there are more

showing up and the apparent leader of 12

dragons motions to the one who's got

black armor on and the one wearing black

armor stops and casts a spell and you

see this like semicircle appear of light

up here on the ground it's about a

hundred and fifty feet across large and

that circle goes and it makes like a

dome this huge dome in front of you and

then it retreats and when it reach

retreats there's a unit of lightly

armoured soldiers all standing there

it's not obvious how many there are

because there are filed in ranks there

they're heavily armed unitive looks like

you guys are all soldiers it looks like

they're a unit of light infantry and as

this tall rioja night approaches he

takes his his he still got his helmet on

and he throws it at one of the red

Falcons and the red Falcon guy catches

it and he's like I'm now holding this

[ __ ] uh-huh and he approaches the

Falcons and he says how now who are

these men in your charge we've come to

speak with them and lady Antonia says

they are bonded couriers that we are

escorting off the island what are 12

dragons doing here and there's a hole

gonna be a whole conversation between

these these two characters I changed I

don't talk to her oh yeah I forgot about

you know yet I'm just give them a look

and do that so the key slit their

throats I don't know just like hold them

off so the commander of 12 dragons is

not really interested in a woman

commanding red Falcons he wants to talk

to you folks and she's trying to

interpose herself between you and him

but he's basically ignoring her and he

says couriers say you seem heavily armed

for couriers what brings you to the

pellet I defer you to our handler well

if you're not willing to speak on your

behalf we could arrest you now and lady

Antonia says house Alvaro has no

jurisdiction here on the island these

are the princes lands and the Knight

Commander of 12 dragons says these

people won't mind if if we take these

apparent criminals into custody who

knows what they're here trying to do

he says look at them there's some kind

of rattle and lady Anthony is like she

says something under her breath like I

know I know what you're trying to do and

he says is that a gift a gift a goblin a

drow and a tiefling what manner of group

is this what kind of wastrels do we have

here who want you wouldn't say kind of

who foppish Calabar are you take your

pack of filthy Mane's and be gone

filthy Mane's he says and turns to 12

dragons and they start they start

laughing they're all men by the way I

got rides a dragon hey do you know

anyone who rides a dragon it can

actually I know a lot of people that a

lot of creatures that ride Dre and sure

I mean dr. gif it's somehow like related

to as red dragons he meant the the blue

dragon kind of goes like step step step

step and take select forwards and forth

steps forward how big is this thing I

mean it's it's um I would say you know

three times bigger than like words okay

right so it's it's it's big that's big

enough it's big enough to carry man but

it's not like an ancient it's not a blue

dragon and he said he turns - he turns -

lieutenant he doesn't address lady

Antonia

and he says I feel the princes lands are

being very poorly administered if

rabble's such as this are allowed to

walk free not even bonded Knights

couriers are allowed to carry weapons in

the city you know you well know that and

lady Antonia says they're in my custody

I am escorting them off there our

problem not yours whatever you think is

happening here is

this is so tense

yeah well I'm I'm I'm quasi giving you

folks the opportunity to chime in not

that there's any need to King told me to

slit my throat zippers killin captain

would you take your orders from so the

the commander of the night commander of

all dragons takes a step forward and

says could you take your orders from gif

I'm the I'm the pilot of the chain of

Akron the chain of Acheron chain of

Akron let's see I know he starts naming

different orders of knights in the city

and he says never heard of the chain of

Acheron

are you in charge you seemed it would be

the one doing the speaking and Lady

Anthony is like he's uncharged they're

in my kind he's just ignoring her hmm do

these men work for you she's in charge

you're gonna have to talk to her he is

the captain

Oh none of us are speaking ah so what

brings the captain of the chain of Akron

to the pellet why would a mercenary

company be hired and sent here but what

possible use could you be the point to

discuss why we're here with him as you

said and you noticed that the lieutenant

of the red Falcons the black eye is like

has his hand on Lady Anne Tania's

shoulder and it's like whispering in her

ear fervently and she's like not

listening to him and she says lady

Antonia approaches the night commander

of 12 dragons and says

I'm arresting these these mercenaries on

for these laws breaking these laws

violating the the peace binding act

carrying weapons in the city barring

courier seals under false pretenses

they're coming with me if you want to do

anything about it then then you're gonna

be taking up your your agreement not

with the chain of Akron but with 12

Falcons I'm sorry I got stopped making

right Dawkins I got stopped making a

paulie's different put the red Falcons

and the commander is resplendent blue

enameled plate male with his blue dragon

standing behind him says red Falcons red

pigeons more like useless even when the

Prince was alive and he turns to the

assembled members of red Falcons and

says why don't you go back to your farms

be more useful there and you would be

here what kind of Knights would take

orders from a woman he says for the

first time addressing lady Antonia and

says and then and then he approaches and

for the first time talk to her and says

lady Antonia and kind of looks her up

and down and says a faint echo of your

great father I knew your father and lady

Antonia turns to her lieutenant and you

hear her say did you say you could trust

these guys and he said brutal but

honorable and she takes out a little

like notebook and she writes a note on

it and tears it off and hands it to him

and says make sure my husband gets this

and then she turns back to the commander

of 12 Falcons and says I'm sorry I'm

taken

you knew my father tell me did you know

your own and the commander the commander

of a paladin's like a good one smiles

and boughs a little bit and turns to his

men and his his men are just happy as a

clam that things are going the way they

want and the guy takes the commander of

twelve dragons takes one of his gloves

off and throws it on the ground in front

of her at her feet

you dropped your glove Caliban he turns

to you and says the adults are talking

and lady Antonia reaches down picks up

the sky's glove and slaps him one mm-hmm

and at this point all of the members of

two things happen at once the other

members of twelve dragons all take a

couple steps back all is one right

meanwhile all the members of red Falcons

that saw that all kind of surge forward

and the lieutenant stops them and around

get the other girls know listen to

invisible you guys are standing I'm like

a failure there's guards watching

everywhere so does she she doesn't

expect us to help her expects to die but

yeah yeah though the issue is if she

dies then we are going with this guy and

that's I think if he dies then her

lieutenant will take control and he will

take us to where we need to go lady

Antonia with her left hand grabs her

sword and pulls it out of its sheath but

in a way that is like literally like

this well not like this right right mm

and in a flash

[Music]

the commander of 12 dragons cuts her now

draws his sword and just like six

attacks at once and looks like what slim

does when he's aced it mm-hmm and there

was blood everywhere and lady Antonia

collapses the red Falcons all surged

forward they start drawing the weapons

12 dragons they don't draw their weapons

they stand for they've got an entire

unit behind them

the unit is standing fast waiting for

orders the blue dragon doesn't doesn't

move but it does stand up and it inhales

hey slim grab her grab her lady she dead

yeah okay yeah and we're told the

lieutenant we will we will help her the

lieutenant is my turn pick her up I mean

I mean yeah probably I don't think

there's anything anything technically

stopping him you're strong

I've no idea what I apologize in advance

everything goes completely south this is

the alkanes - stand down - stand down

right and he's holding this scrap of

paper you can't read what it says it's

bolded up he's holding the scrap of

paper like like this is her last command

Yeah right

and she's he's and he's and other

soldiers are coming up to him and he is

kind of telling them what to do and

already the commander of 12 dragons has

put his his blade back and says

hopefully the new commander of red

Falcons will be more reasonable than the

hot-blooded woman who was foolishly

trying to lead damn yeah chatters like a

gibbering mouthing I mean a parasites

instantaneous so oh you all are away I

can cast I got her

okay I want to do lieutenant approaches

you he is pointing at slim and he says

what are you doing

we're going to help her we're going to

help her is a some sort of custom that

we don't know about to sit in the city

no good no help anyway it was as mean as

a cleric when somebody like this is

killed in the street

yeah she'll help them yeah he steps

forward and he says like he whispers to

you and he says they know you're not

Knights if you cast a spell here they

will cut you down oh I know as a 12

dragon guy you know this is this is this

is lieutenant hisses at you he says do

nothing can we leave okay then we do

nothing can we leave it if you know what

there will say he points to you and he

says hang on her yeah yeah I see what we

can do but I grade the strongest among

us you can carry her yeah and she's uh

stood by us and the commander of twelve

dragons says now let's be more

reasonable and why don't you all come

with me well visit the Duke I'm sure

we'll be interested in hearing from you

meanwhile I think it's time that a more

reasonable and well-trained organization

took over the administration of the

palette and when it says that the

lieutenant spins around and now he's

kind of got this guy's attention oh he's

like the pellet is still the princes

lamb and he has a very different

attitude and lady Antonia Lee engineer

was very kind of like all right come on

this doesn't have to but this guy's like

don't [ __ ] with me all right

he says the pellet is still the princes

line and we're still as administrators

and the commander of twelve dragons says

the prince is dead and you couldn't even

keep your your captain alive so for the

time being I think that it would be best

if our soldiers turns turns did you not

see you just cut down that lady I can do

instantly I can do Stand Down soldier we

gonna save this woman who helped us and

he's in case you haven't noticed he's

not the job do the job says to slit her

this is in case you haven't noticed it

points to the unit of dudes that are all

like really well armed armored and

they're dozens of them forget the 12

high-level Knights are standing

there guy was in case you haven't

noticed we are outnumbered and then you

hear a voice say says who

and the crowd parts and you see you know

a very loose organization of men and

women walk walk through the crowd and

they all are wearing high green boots

dark dark green and red and black

outfits and the red Falcons let them

through and this is about 20 of them all

told they're not marching in

rank-and-file but they're walking

together and they have the same you guys

are all wearing real and outfits but

they're all wearing the same livery that

you folks wear and you recognize

corporal Mudd who was served with you

and was in black bottom approaches and

at this point the commander of red

dragon the commander of 12 dragons is

like like his face goes blank as he's

trying to kind of refactor what what the

hell is going on and these this small

but incredibly well trained they are

they are super elite light infantry

they're the Scouts of the chain of Akron

they're the advancers and you don't know

that but these guys do and corporal Mudd

walks up to you and salutes and says sir

we figured sweet would retreat to

capital we got here as soon as we could

still kind of trying to figure out how

you guys got here before us

oh it's the left oh yeah we got a lot to

update you on we've been through a lot

mud is a by the mud is a female by the

way and has a sword a short sword on her

hip but has a heavy tome on chain

and she I mean you everybody would slim

I think yeah everybody here is an old

member over the chain of macron knows

that she's a wizard and she has long

straight black hair she has pale skin

she's Vaz Lorien so where's where's

sweet he passed away with the senior

officer nails in the astral see he knew

commander for those mud has a moment of

like holy [ __ ] and then kind of when

Jeff says that mud and smiles and kind

of collapse you on the shoulder and says

commander King well commander I'm sorry

we're late

but we are and he looks to the rest of

the advancers these are the kind of

elite Scouts of the chain and says we

are well rested well-fed ready for a

fight and then he looks over at the

commander of twelve dragons and says

were these [ __ ] exactly as you say

an ass falls but powerful ones of that

the commander of twelve dragons

approaches and says and points to

lieutenant and [ __ ] says like is there

no law here on the pellet obviously it's

in more dire need of administration than

we thought look that we have an entire

unit of scouts walking through armed and

armoured and how come thee he says to

enter the princes lands thusly garbed

and dropping into this strange formal

speech for a moment and mud looks to you

and looks over at the commander of

twelve dragons and says Navy guys let us

in and that causes the commander of

twelve dragons to kind of like

and keep mud she proceeds to she

proceeds to explain like yeah we got

escorted in he says I don't know who the

guys with the who the guys with the

Raven the raven crest and then another

or Scout goes house borona yeah I think

they call themselves house piranhas

they intercepted us and we were trying

to get to the big island yeah and she

gestures over so the big island and then

house brothah said no we were do here

she says I don't know I don't know what

they knew but they seem to think it was

important we got here as soon as

possible so anyway yeah House house

Verona he says and to the 212th Ragan's

that she says that changes the sorry

that changes the tenor of the

conversation somewhat yeah the dragon

guy looking like now is it like

calculated nerds dude you look like a

little white freaked out by the

information uh he is thinking and then

his lieutenant who was wearing this red

dragon armor walks up to him and starts

whispering in his ear and he says we're

gonna stay here on the island for the

time being and the lieutenant looks at

you folks lieutenant of red Falcons

looks at you folks and says we're I'm

gonna take my prisoners and escort them

off the island and twelve the commander

of twelve dragons says I wish you a

speedy journey and at that point the guy

starts retreating and says we go yeah

let's go yeah but I'm she says she says

but the her I'm after all

we got a lot to talk about the city it's

a very different place there's a lot of

information you know about you can

remember that guy's face and we'll talk

about him

then you can think about it in the

future but not right now not today as

you're leaving mud she smiles at the

commander of 12 dragons and waves and

says nice meeting you all right and but

there's now a unit of people on the

island and the there's now a huge crowd

like there's hundreds of people all

gathered to see what's going on and the

person who is writing in the notebook a

one the woman reporter splits pronoun

perhaps another day Caliban

[Music]

the lieutenant it's got this clutching

the speech the piece of paper and says

we gotta get you off the island hurry on

up eyesight um guys on the hill if we

get out of sight for a moment to the we

can revive your captain yeah yeah you

can turn around yeah everyone huddle

around her let me play you a song sir

thanks for helping us tell me if I'm

wrong but it's one accident

instantaneous yeah I know I know how it

works yeah yeah you Reza you resurrect

lady Antonia huh

and she gasps and she's white as a sheet

she's still I think this one should come

back with like one hit point yeah one

hit burn so she's very very badly one go

ahead and lay hands on her and I look at

where the rest of my seven teenagers be

okay that that helps a lot you see color

returned to her and she she grabs you

and it says how many were killed

it's just used to you it's one in the

zero none yeah Wow

she says it's a miracle and she kind of

staggers to her feet and looks around

and sees that things have changed and

she looks up the sky appears to have

only been a few moments since she she

died and she says thank you welcome she

bends her hand in sense I hate my life

it's not over yet yeah well I think we

did we owe you ours layout as well so

it's the least we could do and then the

lieutenant says 12 dragons are staying

here she's like what she's like he's

like that's the best picture

he's like there and he explains what she

missed so I've been like yeah minutes is

it like is it 1 minute last minute has

probably been more than a minute since

that happened but well you know

narrative lis been a narrative been

another combat yeah so yeah things

happen very quickly once once she

dropped and he explains that you guys

you're reinforcements showed up and that

it looks as though 12 dragons is gonna

at least stay here and try to invest the

pellet like taking over and so she's

like so this yeah so this isn't over and

she looks at a lieutenant she says is it

just for her spear no there's like

you're surrounded by right balance okay

so we need it we need to tell them well

I'm just gonna somebody is I'm just

gonna scribble a note as we walk to give

her blah what I'm viola they were there

with us it was well yeah so yeah I'm

hugs like so who are those guys the

Dragons

the men on there ya know what the dragon

oh she's like what the heck is going on

right there the Knights of a very

powerful faction in the city let's get

back to our squid ship before you yeah

did you see a peculiar looking ship on

its way over when you were on your way

up how do you all know [ __ ] no way we we

were on and she names she names the ship

they took over here just done regular a

regular virgin vessel was the Navy on

its way over to or dividuals lady

through they intercepted us they

intercepted you know we intercepted us

too

that's true that's right yeah and she

describes she describes this Patrick

Stewart looking [ __ ] who said

that we had an appointment and we were

like yeah that's the Patrick Stewart

like from doing okay yes old he may see

had a Patras to it alright so yeah now

she's still like staggering and trying

to figure out what to do and her second

command it's kind of still in charge and

trying to fill her in and and he's like

we got to get these people off the

island she's like we gotta get we have

to get you off the we've got to get you

back to where was it you were going

doesn't matter she stays you should

probably lay low for a little while if

that guy who thinks he killed you sees

you alive he might just try and kill you

again

go he's she's like honor has been

satisfied that creature and then she

stops marching like everyone scream jerk

and like the Falcons like basically

guarding you right and all looking over

their shoulder waiting to see if the if

the twelve dragons are kind of gonna

come and follow up and she stops and

I'll Qing then they all take a couple

steps forward and then they stop and

they turn and she's like maybe you

shouldn't leave the island what are you

thinking

I'm thinking if there's going to be war

I'd rather been I rather be on the

winning side we could join forces to be

honest we want to be out from under

there the fulcrum especially without

they give jobs and are truthful or

forthcoming we don't have any interest

in that so far you all have been the

most honorable people we found in the

city mm-hmm she like she hears that and

she looks at judge yeah all right chefs

coming from a tea flame I mean I love

well I mean is you're pretty impressive

character if you seems like you're under

you're under a contract you have an

obligation to your employer we can get

you off the island but do you have to

fulfill that contract right this second

no we don't even like us in person we

could fulfill the contract we just get

sending the kid the kid is the kid is

out of danger out of there okay so we

can take care of Andy yeah so we don't

need to leave immediately right we just

need to send the kid well we should

speak more by the way across the way we

are able well I can always send leech to

take care of him on the ship Talyn

the lieutenant says maybe we're

arresting him after all

she's like let's go back to the jail

wait a minute

she'll be safe there we can talk now

let's let's go for it yeah all right

so she asks courts you folks to the jail

and now she's a little bit more kind of

back in charge and the jail is a squat

stone building very different from the

library and you're not under arrest

you're just guests of right Falcons and

she says you folks want anything to

drink

yeah Jess I can we get them and they're

like yeah we'll take care of it and

there's this this is a place of business

paid like this is where criminals are

being criminals are being brought in and

there's magic as any people we should

[ __ ] because they have a spy for I'll

borrow in there so the 12 dragons are

gonna know I thought you were writing

her a note that said that well

yes but we need to tell her that before

white I was writing in then we started

talking so I'll go ahead and speak we

pretend it was passed on the way to the

hill yeah this is I call that's a you

wrote to me welcome to capital it's like

you wouldn't happen to have any evidence

switching we can work on that

not currently hmm hasn't life right

she knows that everyone has I guess yeah

oh is it gonna be an issue for us going

back to your station with that spy

potentially reporting to you the red

Falcon or the dragon's spies what like

why are we talking about spies yeah

Alvaro's got wizards and Oracle's they

can they can know what they need to know

like as a as a pause I don't think it

was that like cuz the spot like the

alvaro spy just said that said that he

thought that we were coming coming to

take the library right yeah which is why

well that's what they thought - yeah so

so I don't know I mean well you know it

wasn't effective but that's fine there

are spies whoever told them they thought

that we were there to take the library

right it'd be that same person

presumably well yeah that's what could

have been that they saw us all coming

there thinking we were doing that and

that guy sent it over to all bar oh you

guys are in a break room

it's very Spartan that's pretty much the

same as what you guys would have on if

you if you had your own ship and wasn't

a squid ship right you would have your

own mess hall and stuff like that so

it's very Spartan and it's what you'd

expect a bunch of cops to have and here

red Falcons often are out of their armor

they're wearing uniforms

and they bring you uh you know alcohol

to drink and lady Antonia and her

lieutenant she can assist down she props

one leg hop on a chair and rests a and

they have a priest that's also in

uniform comes and it tends to her and

make sure that she's fully healed and

she kinda after he's done his

administration's she waves him off and

she waits until he's gone and it's just

her or lieutenant than you folks in the

mess and there are a couple of guards

that are guarding this room on the

outside and she's like how many men

could you muster if needs must mustard

yeah one unit of super elite light

infantry that twenty doesn't matter how

many they're out okay well because we

have she we have 27 others on the ship

basically have like it's 24 like yeah

you guys you guys have one very small

unit of medium infantry and that's

basically the people that are that made

it to capital with you and now you've

got a second unit you can so is that

that's not okay that's not that's like a

fee and that's not a unit considered II

so it's probably like like one and a

half six years people okay oh she is

she's interested like militarily she

doesn't wanna know a number she wants to

know like oh we have two units and we

have a very large squid ship yeah well

one medium one Chilean she's like okay I

don't know what that means in the food

dreadknot just like what who are you

people couldn't help but notice that

your death was very messy we need to

train I don't know how much training

would take to stop and then shave means

my commander dick Corrado Ronnie or

Susan my commander dick a row

just getting the document back so if we

lose it at uh salutes the vs. came to

losing yes the one that we sat down are

you getting it back yeah she we don't

with him women told him the truth and

yeah right we haven't told him that

we're still gonna work with the fulcrum

to give them the seal right unless we're

camps in our contract cancel our

contract but like what she sees you

didn't talk about how we can not

completely follow it to the letter of

the law

mm-hmm okay and if we want to survive

we're gonna have to play their game oh

yeah definitely play big ball and we are

the captain now so mm and I'd rather

work with the Bret Falcons to make this

better for them then give the full trunk

more power

we're uh ooh captain why did you work

for the soul come in the first place why

pick she says why picked the fulcrum

over how Saldana

we didn't know we were working for the

fulcrum fulcrum have a lot of money she

says well we're in been here one day

well we didn't think it was they weren't

paid very well yeah yeah the last

mission we did was a lot of money and

that was for we believe Alvaro but again

it was uh more I say it again the last

job we did the last contract last

contract we did was we believe for house

I'll borrow I mean you believe you don't

know you're working for we were working

for what's-his-name resident Hall we

work for who places yeah which was in

this case Reginald or Theo clear who you

who he worked for you I'm dead or

whatever you would call him and so we

knew that there was a house of undead

people we assumed that he was with them

well his lawyer well yes she

she's trying to process everything it

just said she's like full crab a lot of

money how do you feel about her I think

they're rich and they're not house

alvaro hmm what's that she says I have

I've uh I carry the princess crown I

have to think about what the prince

would wanted and he would want 12

dragons off this island if there were a

way hypothetically to establish some

sort of legal claim on this island an

authority that is you know present and

living would that give you the would

that give you the like ability to force

them out it's a force I'll borrow his

hand and make them piss off and then

where would your allegiance lay my

allegiance lies with the prince

therefore if if his situation came to

pass you would be she's sort of confused

she's like I'm not a politician well I'm

not sure I understand what you're saying

she's like if there was a she's like my

problem right now isn't she said my

problem right now is commander Dakar oh

no mm-hmm to get him off the island keel

a she's like she's like her head and her

hand shakes and lieutenant her

lieutenant points that slim yeah and

says there's only one way to do it

what

and she when she's done shaking around

she's like when we when you left when

you left the hill and she looks that

she's basically talking to her

lieutenant

she's talking what you folks did she's

talking to her look at it she's like

when you left the hill you left them in

charge so unless we want to fight and

die for it they just took the library

which means on the map of capital mmm

the pellet is to two districts one of

which has no resource point on it the

other one does it's the library mm-hmm

that one just change calling I think we

should tell her yeah yeah let's speak

plainly yeah I think is our best in

everybody's best interest so let's uh

let's talk about how we're gonna go

about doing that real quick we're gonna

take a break yeah let's let's do that

during France it's only it's only 8:15

but this is I think the content for

tonight so when this wraps up I think

we're done for the night so there might

be an early evening but we are gonna go

take a bio break and get some munchies

and we will be back in about 13 minutes

precise ester we're back so this is the

point where if you've stuck with the

stream this bar first of all Wow

and you're still watching we like to

check out make any announcements we're

gonna do we do now for instance we have

a phenomenal wiki and that seems like

there's been a lot of work done on it

quite recently which makes us happy it's

a huge relief for me as a dungeon master

because when I don't remember something

I can go look it up in the wiki that

folks are and they they scrub through

like years of my campaign because we had

a whole other campaign that we streamed

to afford this one two of them two of us

well we didn't scream all of it we used

several many hours of this you know this

world and this universe and stuff like

that and two of the most prolific

contributors are that we want to say

thanks to our Henry it looks like this -

as

person's name and caps and numbers

there's a whole bunch of entries in

there that have been there are a lot of

people working on it and I see them I

see you folks in the discord talking

about how best to format stuff to make

it easy to categorize and organize and I

think that stuff is phenomenal so thank

you those of you who are helping make

the wiki awesome is a huge use

especially for new viewers who want to

know like who is Lady Sarah Angola

corrupt is a huge entry for Lady Sarah

know the person who ostensibly hired

these [ __ ] in the first place

and now we I haven't seen this so I

gotta make sure not to press the end of

show button that would be catastrophic

but we do occasionally get fan art this

is one of the most inspiring parts of us

running this game and playing in front

of you folks is that some of the things

that happen here inspire people to

create things and I consider that to be

remarkable and we're gonna look at

something right now disappointed once we

died that's awesome dude hehe I think

343 printed the belt to to be a giant

strength nice yeah any slim art is that

Ethan is yeah I haven't seen this I

hadn't seen the sweet cosplay I love all

this person's art like their

interpretation of these characters as

iris I was pretty much how I met it

looks like right looks like a little

diaper that pauldron oh no flaming hell

yeah it's cool it's kind of hard to tell

from here but like the store it is like

two separate blades like I think that's

cool it's great this is boots giving

coppers a thumbs up through the whole

copper made in the golem that's supposed

to be a hole in a golem you can see

throw in the broth golem I think people

like drawing yeah

[Laughter]

yeah that's awesome yeah definitely have

[Laughter]

that is awesome that's cool I'm not

crying

[Laughter]

this is the zoom apples are killing it

like they hell no that's Christmas bulbs

that's Oh are the apples for the fruit

oh yeah they're definitely late look

like Christmas tree balls oh my gosh oh

yeah there's the map of capital what

just happened cuz I did

alvaro that's crazy we have to change it

back that's amazing I don't know that's

awesome that must be Jerry Jerry Jerry

if that was you that saw that happened

live a fluster Jerry that's awesome that

was really cool so thanks for the folks

that helped us out with the wiki it's a

fan managed all that art was created by

folks who just watched the Shane and are

inspired which is really neat obviously

you folks probably already know this but

if you have an Amazon Prime subscription

like I do when I use that thing all the

time you also get a free twitch Prime

subscription that you can throw once a

month to your favorite streamers who

might be the people you look at now I

don't know could be anybody so anyway

there was much discussion obviously

during the break about WTF and I don't

know if any decisions were made or any

agreements were come to they just are

mostly argued about what is going on on

what is gonna happen next so when last

we left our heroes you folks are in one

of the mess rooms in the red Falcons

jail which is a very Spartan squat

building in the middle of now you are in

house I mean according to that map

you're in how solve our mo territory

yeah well no no you guys haven't left

the district for the libraries oh yeah

well that's you described that's going

yep that was pretty sublime yeah which

is pretty crazy Wow

so yeah what do you focus see what is um

lady Antonia going to do Wow what did

you folks talk about offline like what's

your plan now we talked about the

document yes that basically we would

give house Bernadette II claim over the

palette no that was yeah yeah and

therefore the fulcrum as well not that I

was contract but that we just found it

if we go about that's what the kid was

sent here yeah that's true yeah we also

heard about like just fulfilling the

contract and like letting it take its

course kind of thing so he seems to be

in favor of that yeah yeah

that's our thing there he is to fulfill

the contract um were there any other

things that we discussed as far as like

other alternative options on the table

okay somebody sent us these dope ass

pins and a bunch of cool big cats to

different people

somebody sent us somebody said you're

fans make you awesome amazing stuff so

we have sent you some crap

this one says Matt continually distracts

me which as everybody knows is one of

the things people think MCD M stands for

what is what is the official MCD M Matt

big munch that's what Driscoll's

interpretation of MCD I'm also we got a

blimey we got world's okay s dungeon

master so yeah anyway so the discussion

right now is whether or not we're going

to reveal the document - yeah yes the

rest peloton's because well lady anthony

is gonna lead it she know the thing

they're gonna leave the room and let you

guys talk for a while she's got stuff to

do just business to attend to

because now apparently apparently twelve

dragons is in charge of her territory

she has to deal with that but she tells

you that she'll be back in about

appointments I mean there's there's

really no reason why we need to tell her

that just fulfill the contract and and

if she's got another contract for us we

could take it and or

I was just saying she said she said it

as long she said something like it

wasn't alvaro meaning as long as it's

not Alvaro it's someone else she's okay

with I think yeah cuz their thing about

that contract about not the contract

with the document that we have it says

that the prince who she serves and who

she provides by the rules of even in

death is that even death is that like

whatever he decreed she will follow

right that seems to be the general

consensus there and so because this

document says Bernadette E is an

ownership of the pellet yeah then you

would think she would be okay with that

so I don't know if there's actually any

net gain to giving her the heads up on

it other than like maybe we want to work

with her or something and then

is like the thing I was trying to get at

before was well if suddenly you know

she's she doesn't have a job because

Bernhard benedetti maybe she wants to

come in with the chain the other thing

is we could also might be able to work

out something with the fulcrum to try

and keep her in her position and work

with she would just then work with

Bernadette II my so my mentality with it

is I personally feel that they [ __ ] us

around a little bit but so I think we

and we talked about this a little bit

while drinking delicious wine drinks but

oh is this Friday night this was a

little bit Friday night it came up that

we should push for a little bit more

because they they kind of [ __ ] us

around they put us in and they wanted

money they want to install somebody

might says we who [ __ ] over the

fulcrum sent somebody else to get us to

do this job they weren't forthcoming

about what they wanted done or what it

was going to start mud looks that boots

and judging forthcoming right me the

definition or just just so we're we're

the city where it's basically a big wall

[ __ ] dynamite doesn't exist in this

world I've got an event ID there is

gunpowder yeah so they're a guy's house

Verona they're their ships their cannons

yeah so uh imagine is a big stack of

gunpowder surrounded by a bunch of

matches and anything to set them off and

they tried to use us as the match is

that not our job

I mean it's part of it but it doesn't

mean that we can't demand that's a

higher paying job than the [ __ ]

piddly amount of money that we do you

have to say what we talked about anyways

was it trying to get us over established

on this island they want to put somebody

in charge of this island that's under

their wing why not have somebody who can

[ __ ] defend it versus this random

Bernadette II guy would you just go take

the Cinda no back like that one person

wanted to pay that's in their territory

though and

that's for them again if we go try to

take that they're gonna come and fight

us to take that back because it's their

territory that we're taking territory is

it the fulcrums anybody's informed by uh

I don't know I think I think his name is

Matthew Koval dick mantra part of the

book that we worked on was strongholds

followers and when you take something

correctly a stronghold right it's not

yours until you defend it

so ya do want to defend it against the

fulcrum that was true in every of those

true of castle rent you guys you guys

clear cleared out castle rent well then

you have to defend it against Lords

accident before was yours oh I've got an

idea

mm-hmm if we fulfill this contract the

fulcrum effectively takes control of the

pellet right which means that the

fulcrum forces are gonna be custodians

of the island right they have to defend

their stronghold which means if the red

Falcons

whose commander owes us her life they're

out of a job we could just sort of you

know bring them into the fold we expand

our army and then you know we can just

how are they out of a job they protect

the island or do the princess orders

yeah but as matt said out there if

either if either I think what boots is

saying is that if either faction that's

currently trying to like one one faction

I hired you to take the island another

faction sent their army to take the

island well sure were those factions

wins then the islands there's and red

Falcons don't have anybody to work for

yeah so here's the thing that the Dragon

Knights that are there right now like

they're they're in charge so essentially

right now red Falcons sort of unemployed

if we if we fulfill that contract

remember part of the payment was that

they were going to sort of certify you

know my ryokan heritage and that might

come with its own lands or structures or

holds that are perhaps somewhat strong

welcome back to the question of do are

we gonna tell her about this or are we

just gonna tell her that I think let's

keep in contact

I think we I think we should tell her

that like

that this situation isn't about - hey it

stays not about to get any better

situation on this island it's not going

to get any better especially once we

fulfill this contract and the fulcrum is

gonna want to come in and then the

fulcrum is gonna have to deal with the

Dragon Knights and Alvaro and I don't

think any of us are gonna [ __ ] be here

are we been revealing that we

technically lied to her in with the

other contract she doesn't need to know

she comes at lady Antonia opens the door

her lieutenant is kind of right behind

her and she has a leather sack and she

walks in she's stepping through the

doorway and looks at you and says you

sit she looks in and she turns to elute

and says there's only there's only five

in here he's like that's all that's all

I had she's like oh give me your can of

mine she's like find you another one and

he takes a seal him and puts it the bag

and she kind of shakes the bag and walks

in and says you saved my life and right

now we need allies and she takes out six

seals and she says these will be a lot

more useful to you than the courier

seals are carrying and they're ornately

so we're he's a lot they are very finely

crafted metal medallions are about this

big and they have a backs imprint on

them that is stamped and she hands of

each one she's she points at one and

she's like mm-hmm

that's the prints of the seal mmm these

you can go anywhere in the city well

with Wessels

very nice no she's like we don't that's

we don't we don't we're gonna do one

search arcane law yeah don't you have

any more their shiny new daggers so yeah

she's uh she hands issues I don't know I

don't know how much differences it's

gonna make but every little bit counts

right

yes bill well if you uh if you find

yourself in need of getting off

the island because of these people

moreover on the Stace

her lieutenant looks at her like yeah

that sounds good yeah and she's like

let's sloppy each other Moses I swore an

oath to defend this place I took my oath

when the prince was still alive it's

been less than 10 years the long oh I'm

gonna let you go ahead and do it yes no

spilitt yep

yeah she says tell me uh I hope I hope

this doesn't offend you too greatly but

the lieutenant says she's hard to with

all right the job wasn't the kid we have

a document yeah that says that basically

gives a legal claim to a legal claim on

this island from the prints from the

prints a previous prints previous prints

about 300 years ago that gives house

brilliant wait wait what what document

it is something you recover from the

library yes what the kid was something

yet what hold on let's let's tell you

what this is first this document gets

clean you that you claim exists yeah

yeah go finish your sentence

I'm just kidding boots wouldn't say that

that's really I'd say that to you it's

[Laughter]

that's a strong wine this document

claims to give ownership or

custodianship or what-have-you

of the island to house bruna daddy who

sprited daddy who seems to be working

under the fulcrum we're working with the

fulcrum or a part of the fulcrum and

Saturn's don't shake

like now as you lieutenant said we're a

man of honor and to fulfill this

contract would essentially put this

island in the hands of the fulcrum as

you said yourself the falconer very rich

the fulcrum are not housed Alfaro but at

that point we might be talking about

sparking on a full you know full-blown

war well she says as she gestures holds

out her Angela early tenant and a

lieutenant hands her a broadsheet and

across you you've now seen several

different broad sheets and this one is

the largest headline you've ever seen

and it just says war and it shows a map

of capital and it shows it's highly

stylized it's like calligraphic it's

drawn with a quill pen and it shows that

the fulcrum have lost the district that

contains the citadel and that it's

currently announced Nevarez hands hmm

and there's probably a couple of other

spots on the map or that where neutral

territory has changed hands but that

doesn't know which ones yet okay so you

will find out what I find out are there

still princess territories within yeah

there's still but a lot of the princess

territories are even gobbled up mm-hmm

Wow okay so even just like the hint or

like the threat of potentially somebody

trying to claim over the peril it has

basically set it off a chain reaction

all over the place it already happened

yeah you guys you guys were basically

there when the Citadel thing happened

yeah like that that happened why you

guys were talking and so if you read the

article I don't think there's been open

war yet but it talks about 12 dragons

taking you know in a bloodless coup I

think as the phrase he uses twelve

dragons have invested is the phrase that

they deploy as invested the libraries

mean she bled a lot yeah we're gonna

report her at the Bloodless

well I think the people are expecting

that a lot of war and so something like

what happened that you guys just were

part of like there was there were the

red Falcons out really relatively there

was like at least an entire unit worth

of infantry including pikemen just in

red Falcons plus 12 dragons they had a

unit plus you guys had a unit and

somehow somehow that territory changed

hands a fight did not happen

so yeah somebody died people die all the

chance anyway she throws that she throws

the broadsheet on the table let's

mention us in the part about the Falcons

I don't know it might I don't think it

does okay mmm-hmm I think it just talks

about 12 dragons and red Falcons and a

battle for the library or conflict it

says a conflict over the library and the

red Falcons retreated anyway so what you

were saying back here but there's this

mythical document act that says that

this whole island belongs to somebody

I've never heard of it's not mythical so

you say get it out yeah let's let's just

show her yeah

wolf it out cats what go to change that

stage all right well you've got the

document okay well she she reads it and

she she says well yeah you lied to us

about why you were here but that's okay

we didn't believe you about that anyway

and she reads that she folds it up and

she's like

commander King what would you do in my

shoes she answered the document well let

me tell you a story about a town called

Black Bottom hmm she's like I've been to

Black Bottom why are we talking about

black line because it was destroyed

right yeah so if it's looking like this

area is gonna be destroyed you got to do

right by your men and retreat let's

still fulfill your job which is

protecting this land now you may lose it

temporarily but that doesn't mean you've

completely lost

you haven't completely lost until you're

dead in the ground her lieutenant says

kind of he's she's sitting down she sits

down and he's standing kind of above and

behind her and says what about the

Prince and she's like she was I don't

know why we would retreat unless there

was some reason to believe that there

was gonna be another Prince probably

whoever wins this battle this war

whoever ends up in charge of capital get

the provable no declare a new Privy

Council murder anybody on the old one

that doesn't agree to it a new Privy

Council will declare them the prince and

then will be working for them at that

point at that point anybody was left

alive the war's over he's like yeah but

what if that princess dude yeah she's

like well I wasn't a huge fan of the old

prince they over talked about this there

is character but that's never been much

of an issue for this for her mm-hmm it

seems some prince at some point wanted

this house to have the island she says I

don't know if I have it in me to retreat

the lieutenant says do you have it in

you to fight and dying all the men kill

for what and they're obviously having

turns to him like we'll talk about this

outside well the thing about this

document is that it does legitimize a

claim over this island so nobody can

blame you for relinquish unit to the

rightful owners um and I feel free in

saying that I think there's always a

spot for us in the chain for you and

your men lieutenant guy goes huh and

she's like how solve our Oh ladies sure

Oh me go to war it was a chain work in

that scenario she says it's not your

fight you just take your pay and go back

to where you came from

we live here now so we we pick the jobs

based on the client and based on the pay

the long long run game is like a Jets

right like we don't want to work with me

who's directly trying to benefit that

guy uh yeah that's valid yeah I was

thinking more so going into like why we

accepted our last job and impossible

odds which if you've read that Chronicle

entry well I was gonna make a joke book

job wasn't to defeat Ajax it was to kill

his wizard yeah but a piece of that was

we were choosing to take the right side

now versus potentially a higher-paying

side later

so we at this point we're trying not to

work for [ __ ] and the twelve wagons

are for sure [ __ ] and not somebody

would work for even if there well he's a

sexist but he didn't you know come and

cut down a woman in the middle of

[ __ ] street welcomes got a lot of

money

we also don't really know what their

stances in regards to Ajax or anything

like that but they have a lot of

influence lady Antonia that stands up

and kind of comports herself and says

well I guess I need to talk to lady sure

oh man

when you complete your contract let her

know that the captain of red Falcons

would like to speak with her and then

the lieutenant says or a duly appointed

representative mm-hm

she says remember now for whatever it's

worth you carry the princess the seal

will try to do right by it you saved my

life

so for what it's worth if you need

anything let me know

so here's your letter back well unless

he wanted me to hold on to it the letter

that she wrote and gave to her

lieutenant yeah the one she wrote one oh

and gave it to us at once' you said

they're Men of Honor get this to my

husband if she let other lieutenants

give that us don't know it's earth

salute I had that he gives it back to

her the good ideas it's a good idea but

you don't cut that letter I do and she

takes it and doesn't even read it and

couples and throws it away she says well

I guess we still have to get you to the

dog she says we still have to get you

out of the columns but that's just a

formality

assuming twelve dragons doesn't trying

to stop us once we get to the Olive

district you'll be free to go

let's do it all right she escorts you

personally out of this district there's

still a city gate that divides the two

districts and it's still manned by red

Falcons there's no evidence when you

leave the jail that 12 dragons is in

charge business as usual seems to be

happening yes usually and you folks are

free to go and do what you want you know

have Knights seal

legitimately given to you by princess

representative and you've finished the

library job you all of look I mean

number sixteen 77217 yeah so we're

talking about currently a level every

eight and a half session late you it's

very quick so I think I was sixteen

today

last time was sixteen I just did

campaign down yeah campaign diary number

sixteen

this is leeches seven seven and so oh

you had the ketchup I know correct and

so now you're at you're taken to the

like your ship is that evaluation yeah

your ship is at the docks and uh lady

Antonia it's kind of like holy crap what

the [ __ ] is that

so vetoing she wasn't swear she says

holy crap was that the somnium tenebrous

we didn't name it like this we should

maybe give it its own where did you get

that from some wank master real if it

probably named it that dumb dross it's

bad luck to rename ship bro you can't do

that how would the ship know who we were

talking to when you've gone out like

this a long time to teach you it's a new

name we got that from the astral sea was

clean ship last people who tried to look

I command this [ __ ] she shakes her hand

and says good luck same to you into you

[ __ ] starts popping off out here between

the fulcrum in the and the twelve

dragons at the plate I've still got the

princess crown just a lady assure me no

I want to talk to her

alright what the princess crown like the

actual crown no that's a seal oh it's

just a coin it's symbolic but let's row

me no I haven't handed back but you know

that I've got a green lantern powering

[Laughter]

she's like she's like I'm she still has

to figure out how to like what is her

legal responsibility yeah mm-hmm like

forget what I want to do you know what I

want to do is I want to go home and see

my husband but what I'm obligated to do

is is is follow a lot the red Falcons

are the rule of law in this island

because I don't care what goes on in the

city but here at least things are still

run like there were an Old Capitol and

so we may end up working for 12:00

dragons shakes around like holy crap

yeah anyway it's fulfill this contract

no we're absolutely going to I assume

[ __ ] TRO me uh I want to talk to

shrooming daughter Lackey I'm not gonna

hand it over to the Lackey I say we need

to have a conversation but that's

two-shoes is on the somnium to neveress

and welcomes you folks back and set and

it's like Oh what amends like so and

they take the unit of scouts on the ship

and the chain soldiers that are Manning

the ship are ecstatic to discover that

there's a unit of advanced Scouts that

survived the fall of black bottom and

muds like I think there's more but I

don't know where they went

mm-hmm I just kind of had to think about

where sweet would go and I figured you'd

come to capital all right what if

there's something to put the word out

look if any if any others made make it

to capital we've got our spy network all

that then we should probably put

information out to what does it cordon

that course here what's called for Syria

I've listened too much black outfit a I

want to say catobar that's DEFCON of our

yeah yeah yeah no the place is just felt

like tomorrow tomorrow you come on get

some refugees but like they just lost a

war well yeah so there's people who are

you know there are different they have

allies here yeah I mean there'll be

there'll be a lot of anti Ajax people in

capital once that - its knocking on the

door

bottom-2 right right now he's kind of

well I mean I don't know I think that

it's not clear how many people survived

all black mm-hm like Ajax left black

bottom alone and let it govern itself

when he conquered all the rest of his

Lauria he's like you guys can stay a

free city you guys can run business how

you want because it helps because he

wants to run this whole planet at some

point and so he wants to make sure

there's at least some people who were

like hey this is awesome and then they

kind of tried to [ __ ] him and so he

wiped off map but yeah I mean there'll

be people in the city or super anti-age

acts once this [ __ ] floating fortress

is hovering over there anyway so yeah

you folks level up what do you do when

you're back on the boat we're gonna go

stays right so this kid by the way if

you take a long rest on the somnium to

neighbors or wherever you go back the

Pharaoh's dream wherever you take your

long rest you'll recover the hit points

that you lost from the spectres yeah Mon

Calamari budak I'm gonna take a long

rest in my [ __ ] little your

exfoliating exfoliant and your

gelatinous bed yes alright I'll pop down

to surgery just rest there fair enough

yeah we're gonna revive the kid first

hey Cara have get up some food some

pudding what do you might kill him so

you folks are at some point gonna go

back to the stays and and let the herald

or society know that you found their

courier and you recovered the document

you're gonna give them the document I

assume I don't think we want like we

want an audience with Romeo me the

heroines like Oh with with with lady

princes troops on the pellet oh yeah as

you as you know the 12 dragons showed up

and taken a heart attack ins there and

that's what we Herald apparently that

given the document to this person we're

saying when you talk to show me about

this document and we know that you work

for sure oh me and then orders like

go and what you can do but basically any

service you can imagine in a huge

fantasy city anything that could be done

through the use of either magic

technology or cash can be found in

capital if you know the right people

you also don't forget we have a spy

network who is probably going to be

feeding in more information and boom at

Seoul now zoom at pool and still owes

you that's yeah sorry

[Laughter]

still owes you folks some information so

we will pursue that stuff next week but

yeah we don't stop playing well for the

next time or whatever we do the downtime

stuff is I want to find out if there's

an ill rigueur society yeah if the spy

network can leave you there and also a

church of Asmodeus would be cool a

one of those toad is definitely like if

there's anybody was gonna know alchemy

because they are notorious onyx for

using poisons yeah and also all sorts of

crazy music the piece master

a bunch of like poison frogs with them

yeah so I think he uses that yeah he

carries them with him everyone's

migrants peaky Sutra well Deacon fly

potions like you can carry so many

potions I understand I mean we're oh D

William Dean carry stuff yet side your

own you'd like I could give him a lot I

think there's one wait I was reading

about you kind of let it out and as it

hits the air it turns into fire so give

me like a little napalm we'll see about

that

I found it on some site somewhere

wait weren't you gonna do something with

that metal that you go that's why we're

saying you're gonna be busy yes he wants

you to forge a sin metal weapons gonna

be a weapon I've gone again stuff like

technically I I mean I I mean I well you

know and you know how to make weapons

blacksmith tools well that's what yeah

buts is helping out yes she's a wizard

you need three things you need a Smith

oh just a regular everyday Smith who

knows how to make weapons warmer okay

you need the special metal and you

nitwit okay and the wizard there is act

there's a fourth thing that you

technically need which is recipe and you

guys are having recipes but we're gonna

wing it because there's lots of things

you can do with this in metal there's

like the the basic properties you guys

already know but there's lots of things

lots of weapons armor you can only make

with sin metal a lot of its obscure same

things true of the Sun metal the blood

metal they're not they're not they're

not each one specific thing

they each have a basic property and then

there's all these branching different

things you can make from you guys

haven't found any recipes so we're gonna

have to kind of wing it

alright and judge is supposed to get a

demon heart sword yeah I have to do

something with that yeah that's what I

meant when I say busy stuff to do me

first me first

like maybe you guys need to find another

box but you could what you do want to do

read the book or what make weapons well

depending how many days do I have you

could just head to the astral sea take

as long as you go back it'll be like

it'll be like hundreds of years

no you just donate no it's not it's meat

time doesn't really know is different

space well I guess it's not different

time but it's it is it is different time

in the

the time and space are basically the

same phenomenon so you guys were eight

that's that's that's what mud meant when

muds like still don't know you guys guy

here before it's because he doesn't know

about the somnium he doesn't know about

the Rosso Cielo she she doesn't know

about thrusts of CLO and and the whole

thing they did to get into the astral

say so how much time is gonna pass like

we it's gonna be it's it's not gonna be

more than two weeks I don't think I mean

because read the book I forget how it's

like a month it's a much I don't think

I've got access to smart people who know

things that I don't yeah cuz we'll need

to figure out how much time we'll take

to the weapons everything else to figure

out like if you spend 48 hours over a

period of six days or fewer studying the

books contents practicing its guidelines

your wisdom score yeah transcendental

tardigrade said how long do you think

the twelve dragons commander's brain

could power a psionic cannon oh I like

that person yeah committed the chat is

dubbed this dragon knight commander

commander erroneous gave us gifted 20

subs I know Steve Austin chat thank you

very much

Wow 20 subs is a colossal that I might

spend on this nonsense I think we

appreciate we appreciate it also when

you guys return to the Pharaohs dream

you're super fancy duds are waiting they

are you guys are which means by the way

that you guys are now gonna get a minor

bonus to any kind of diplomacy's checks

you make oh no it was nobles in the city

because you are you spent the money and

are now properly dressed well not only

that almost but I'm starting a new

fashion trend armor with foppish wear

clothes really no vidi Seraphim three

three three also gifted 20 subs the

percentage of people in people in our

chat to people with subscriptions

is I think it's probably one of the

highest on twitch there a there are

there are certainly more popular twitch

dreams and ours but I can't imagine that

they have the same crazy percentage of

subscribed users Dale Kingsmill

apparently has a dope apothecary system

which I will look into that kind of

stuff uh you know those arrows I got yes

um that's you know where they came from

they were a famous famous elven Archer

zeros I like the idea of like maybe I

can't make anything as strong as them

but like if I could learn that type of

like craft thing that's is that like is

that like a magic either kind of a well

making magic AIIMS takes takes people

and audio cast spells right but it

depends like we can talk we I mean if

you want to look like yeah I mean

there's there there are ways to do it

okay like if you want to make magic

arrows yeah

depends on what kind of magic arrows you

want to make I mean obviously won't be

fireballs and stuff but like if it's

like at some point maybe but like some I

don't know something we could come up

with all its bones boys and frogs

yeah you know I don't know maybe some

some fun things you could figure out

like why don't you shoot frogs people a

little kid because typically like the

like I said the making of magic items

requires somebody who knows how to

physically make the item that's usually

very workmanlike thing right so like you

you might be able to make our own it's

not hard to make arrows yeah you might

be able to make arrows but you're not a

spellcaster all right well you're a

ranger ascended Ranger is doing spells

so depends yeah you might be able to

make like you might be able to pick a

spell and spend some money and find them

find somebody with experience and making

magic stuff and cast the spell as you

like there's you can you there are rules

and strongholds and followers for making

magic items all you need is the right

follower oh and the chain I think we can

assume that the chains rank-and-file

soldiers contain people of a broad

variety of different skills yeah so yeah

we can figure it out we just got a look

at your spell list or and figure like

what kind of what kind of hair do you

wanna make mm-hmm like it would be cool

to have an arrow of yes one cool spell

well like okay we'll see we can do

okay cool baby anyway so yeah so for

that week yeah I'll work eight hours and

the smithy yeah okay I spent eight hours

studying my book I think for a month

did you read it okay I'd say it was it

was 48 hours over six days oh it's 40

really yeah that's interesting okay so

like eight hours there's a couple of

books in strongholds and powers at that

same rule and so I'm like okay I dude I

turns out I do not know how about 48

hours over six days no problem

yeah I think I might have because it is

supposed to be it's not like that's how

the there's a couple of different like a

man met a manual of gainful exercise

right is the same thing where you do

this and after a certain time you're

stringing all the same yeah your

strength goes up or there's there's

different tones study this down and I

think have different different results

language currently occupying it no no

that was the Citadel and they're not the

ones occupied it is the church the

church has taken that from the fulcrum

the Colosseum no the Colosseum is a the

Colosseum is in the middle of the city

Colosseum is encircled what color is

that

it's not it's not a district it's a it's

a landmark cuz I think that should

absolutely be our stronghold if we have

one because I feel like you'd be a great

gladiator and all there's no there's no

it's not nobody just reestablishment

sure he's a he's a gladiator of no

winding stands out in the middle he's a

gladiator of the sword it covers in

pig's blood or something walks out alone

and then he declares victory

yeah we could reopen schools I was

actually thing about that earlier I was

like yeah I think there's a Coliseum and

in fact like gladiators um yeah yeah I

never got one yeah

the good ones we [ __ ] put in the bad

ones that's right you guys have to

decide whether or not first of all you

have a couple tickets to the Opera God

did it Tolkien the top you have to

decide whether or not gonna do it and oh

yeah somehow according the mud

she will rule as she has already related

to the process house Bruna just helped

you guys out yeah us to go do the talk

so because they are the ones that made

sure that the advancers who were not

headed to the pellet got to the pellet

accordionist right of course yet a navy

gone through so it's up to you guys

whether not you I mean if you're it's

hit so yeah it's a great opportunity for

them to kind of influence events without

actually getting a fight is they didn't

do anything

just make sure so that's true

and go there yeah we're up [ __ ] creek

that paddle yeah that's the second big

solid that they've done us just for kind

of you know just because they like is

well know they wanted to look like we're

working for them without actually

employing us right and thus far they've

gotten away with it yeah cuz I do it

this time they actually helped us out a

lot so I was he he was on a guy was ill

I mean all they did was all they liver

first the advancers to the palace

hopeful right I knew exactly where we

are in this massive [ __ ] see like Jana

you guys go to here

remember that house Verona and Alvaro

are ostensibly allies because they're

both Knowles

the way the way everything's been

characterized to you guys is the nobles

versus the guilt you meet Alison still

competitors though only one person to

Prince is angel on some you never know

an angel is at

what do you call it do you think you

stole the princess footstool cuz I wanna

know how their friends he'll tell you he

says I wouldn't talk to that Patrick

Stewart that's why have the dragon guy

was oh well it was angel yeah that does

make sense no he was talking about

Patrick Stewart from dune and nah not

yeah okay he was not Patrick just wanted

me not Patrick Stewart and like the old

guy now but like back when I was young

it's good

I still remember him it's calibre xqo

this is Wow it's no it's crosstalk and

you can't understand any of this because

we're all talking over each other but

but this is the regular everyday

postgame conversation we normally have

so I think we're plugging in the stream

like I've got a list of all the crap you

guys are kind of gonna come up with next

week with the beginning of the next

adventure we'll start and you guys will

meet some important people and probably

crazy [ __ ] will happen and probably

gonna roll some dice next week and maybe

maybe some neat stuff will happen kill

some [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] off [ __ ]

whoever's name was a big great Victor

Oni that's like our glades we'll swim in

his entrails well not today okay take em

anywhere it's here thanks for watching

everybody a short session but she was I

think important and momentous and next

week I think we're gonna go back to

somewhat more standard regular dandy but

we're still a down time so this is we're

gonna slowly climb out of the downtime

into some kind of actual adventure of

the chain of Akron just witness to the

transfer of the columns one of the

districts on the pallet from neutral

hands

the princes hands into the control of 12

Dragons jackhole and in the process they

saved the commander of the red Falcons

she rewarded their

risking their lives on her behalf by

granting them knighthood so they're now

free to go anywhere in the city they

want and we'll do a campaign diary which

we'll upload next Wednesday and you can

find out how much of this I had any idea

what's gonna happen and how much was me

going Oh word okay well that's gonna

happen thanks for watching everybody

until next week I'm see ya little pip
