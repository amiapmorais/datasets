we are MCD and productions we play D&D

we all know the head are we play rock

and roll

[Music]

[Music]

okay or it won't really show when last

we left our heroes the chain of Akron

had just arrived in capital the greatest

city in this or any age at least that's

what they're propagandists say and had

gone through customs do not agree with

this assessment well what would you vote

would slim say was the greatest city in

this or any region questions he would

say it's his his home city built on the

corpse of a dead God that's pretty dope

yeah it's a nice city but it's not built

and having gone through customs you

folks spent some time on the promenade

where you saw a bunch of crazy stuff and

met a bunch of people including a

reporter who talked to you it's

perfectly perfectly normal everyday

mild-mannered reporter hem and and then

some kids stole your book you chased him

across the this part of the city or on

an island called the stays and after a

somewhat the surprisingly long and

drawn-out battle in which they prove to

be a little bit tougher than they might

otherwise seem captured one of them and

recovered your book well done some now

what times everything you know we'll

pull your legs off yeah for those of you

those of you who weren't here five

minutes ago before the stream went live

but not really how could you be you're

not to blame

and it was suggesting you could just

often make him he can't be charmed

they're immune to try their constructs

so they're being charmed but they're not

immune to getting their legs pulled off

these guys kicked my ass last time so so

to set the scene you guys are in a

dead-end alley wet somewhere in the

middle of still probably the promenade

and you have a captive you have one

member of the call but they call

themselves this one point for the spring

when they not want you guys down

and they look like they're like I think

probably like nine it looked like

they're like nine year olds I don't even

look like they're teenagers no I think I

described I imagine them being a certain

height and I think they are too short to

be they look like they look like they're

they look like street urchin so we just

kick the [ __ ] out I'm a bunch of little

kids it's just it's just to trick you

into taking pity on them the one you

have captured says I prefer the term

makeshift boy oh boy boy and they look

so it looks confused scramble those

circuits yeah

supply in my in my counter rotating

expression algorithm there's gonna be

some flaws and and you can see this if

you don't start stopping what do you

want to know

why'd you sue my diary I guess I don't

keep the I don't get to keep the book

book book book yeah but why do you want

it Oh grandmother told us to it

it was grandmother oh she's the person

that made me is there like um here you

I'm behind him I've got a man hey are

you like a joke oh well remember like we

when we ended I basically slim that

grappled him and he gave up and okay I

think he still they still like hold on

you don't want to slip away wow look at

judge so your teeth wing I am a judge is

gonna inspect the Robo boy what's it

called again a make made boy he said

they ruined the term makeshift boy yeah

okay whatever so he's just gonna inspect

the outer parts looking for like a brand

of some kind like I'm like a make it

like a makers mark essentially yeah yeah

there is one yes and what does it look

like it looks like a it looks like a the

instance highly stylized gear with like

a with felt like a rasping all which is

a latch that

what a grandmother want the book I don't

know don't know I'm sure they'll find a

way and somehow maybe they don't need it

where is grandmother oh she wouldn't

like it if I told you that that that

that she's I don't like it that you

didn't finish your job either well

nobody's perfect kicked and you can see

because I did this kid he's got bits

missing and you can see gears and and

mechanisms and hydraulics kind of

worrying away you're not there tiefling

but you know who's but you don't look

like I mean look nice I mean I like nice

not like you know but Wow armor and

really took it to get to get together

yeah well I had to earn this Slim's

gonna stick his finger in one of the

holes and twiddle with the gear I like

and when you do that he will Pete's

things that he said earlier no just kind

of randomly how come he doesn't talk

much

he seems angry actually you all seem

angry especially I mean it's a it's it's

a it's a I now know just let me see it's

a it's a gear with a little like click

one of those kind of things right yeah

the hooking a crane head a bird head

it's not bird head but alright

a made boy anyway boy so I have no idea

what if anything people heard of the

last Oh most of it okay okay okay yeah

like figured most of the ways that we

hello about now anyway so yeah

where were we before we were so rudely

interrupted you said Merle angry yeah

yeah I'm just reading this book and he

shrugged whenever we said something that

make you angry we're second and all the

nice pictures of yeah he's a construct

he could if we wanted to have a word

with your grandmother I'm sure she's

delightful

how would we be able to uh get in

contact with her do you think nice

he is the nice one you should listen to

him really yeah

do you listen to her and listen to me I

believe you don't don't think

grandmother would like to talk to you

well she wants something to Mars doesn't

she she did it did but she doesn't want

anymore she shrugs would hear a lot

you're a lot tougher than we thought but

but but yeah it's a pretty tough - what

happens if you go back to grandmother

empty-handed

oh it won't be the first I hmm yeah I

asked what happens is this just your job

like you just steal people for your

grandma

well she she gives tells us stuff to do

I like feeling useful and we're good at

it fair enough

normally people don't put up a fight

mm-hmm I see well how hard would it be

to like tear this dude's head just like

probably do it I mean it's it's not it's

not incredibly well attached in the

first place like I should say as a

result of getting in a fight in getting

wondering if like we just take the head

you think so huh does it still work

ask him if we rip your head off can you

still talk no what about your arms and

legs

well my timing crystal is would have to

would still be intact is that like your

soul

what's a soul yeah I mean that's

interesting is the timing crystal

exposed um makeup perception probably

get one off the busted

I'm poking at the little gears and stuff

to see anything his body starts to

shudder and you see his face start to do

that you've seen it before

it's based are so that thing where each

what looked like solid skin turns out to

just be a little tessellations little

triangles that all get there like one

after the other they loop and they flip

around and now he has the face of like a

really really old woman and you hear

this like his mouth opens and a voice

comes out that's not the voice he's been

speaking with before and this kind of

cackling old woman says Benny let me

drive as this grandma we're speaking to

what did he tell you my apologies to the

chain of acheron made a bit of a mistake

I did don't think I'll be doing that

again you can see this it's it's like

small because this guy's headed that the

size of a cent hasn't changed but now

there's like a wizened old like almost

Yoda looking like carrying on with your

business

I want to turn the gentleman's money and

leave you to the more senior guilds

here's the gentleman I'll be taking

penny if you don't mind

ah and then and then and then like the

face just goes like dead and the eyes go

back to being the guy you're talking to

his eyes and his entire body goes with

my tailors timing crystal Oh

I mean you could try as King said you've

got a bunch of dead bodies now you've

got what is effectively like a corpse

come on a try

yeah you're like there's there's no need

to make a check he's he's dead oh yeah

you're able to rip the head off I want

to do invite him to come be a real boy

in love with us thing you want to be

more useful to a whole bunch of people

who actually care for him

we care about you we want to rip off

your legs just inspecting all the little

parts and doodads inside there's a lot

it's a incredibly complex negative hmm

all right it's very interested in how

those things put together so these dudes

they were just based on that they're

just hired to get that they've just

created I think to run for granny yeah

and the grandma was hired by someone

else by someone else

so somebody wants the chronical they

paid them to try and get it from and

it'll probably feel if they can get the

chronical then like they can make us do

it they want cuz that's mm-hmm do we

have a duplicate Chronicle like a dummy

Chronicle no maybe we should walk go up

in the so there's my breast that's not

true

can we make a fake new one likeness as

far as I know you've never said I'm

gonna spend some time and make a

duplicate of the Chronicle well you

would unless you it's how new people

trained to be the chronicler if well the

problem is that you guys don't have or

you would need access to some kind of

read language it smells because the

Chronicle goes back over a thousand

years and you know covering languages I

think suppose it all in one book well

it's supposed to be a big thick tome

it's supposed to be like the model for

it is supposed to be that like a bag of

holding but it's no no no no it's not

matte it's not like that so it's just

cute why if you remember Indiana Jones

like the rigours the Lost Ark and that

point where they get this huge book and

it's got that illustration of the Ark of

the Covenant and it's that's what it's

actually like so one thing still

thousands of years I have a lot of pages

yeah no it's not that it's just you know

the pages are really thin so one thing

that grania said was that she was gonna

return the money to the gentleman and

leave us to the senior guilds implying

that the gentleman is from perhaps are

they called sir guilds well no way

because she was hired

right to get our [ __ ] but she's too

low-level I don't guilds are hiring up

she's gonna give the dude his money back

then he'll go hire somebody hire senior

you probably wanted to talk to us and

that's good way to you lots of better

ways train get our tickets to go to them

I mean I mean like maybe I should

provide some contacts like the Chronicle

is a valuable book of lore like there's

there's stuff in there that it contains

like valuable knowledge for various

types of researcher the issue is that

it's not always obvious what that

information is because the people

writing it didn't know that this was

going to turn out to be super valuable

right like oh there was a great battle

that we were involved in and these guys

lost and there's someone at a university

summer who's like those guys that lost

had this powerful artifact and no one

knows what that battle happened at all

right but it's written the Chronicle

right right so even though a person who

wrote that was like well I didn't like

when I wrote this everybody knew about

this and it was no big deal and even if

you read it now it wouldn't say oh

there's this incredibly valuable

artifact there it just says oh these bet

these guys lost this battle at this

place just the fact that there's

thousands of years yes gonna eventually

yeah there's so it's so the Chronicle

they're there the Chronicle is always

like there's a reason that it's so

valuable and it's kind of the soul of

the company and other people want it

they're not usually willing to kill for

it but you know maybe the Chronicle

would be safe in the somnium net

tenebrous yeah is there any reason to

carry it around

uh write down the days there we have it

you can do that on any paper and

transcribe it later it's up to the

chronicler but often it's because it is

got so much history in it you can use it

to make knowledge checks and be like

this does the Chronicle say anything

about this and sometimes answers yeah

the other thing is that if there are

little clockwork dudes running around

better able to you know put up a decent

fight against us there's certainly

seafaring dudes of equal amount of how

they're gonna get into the zones

break into the ship you know we had we

had the changelings I mean there we also

had a mind flayer hand that allowed us

to get through the different doorways to

get to the navigator oh you guys you

guys got onto the ship without any of

that

yeah yeah hmm it could so yeah in fact

they're supposed to be right right now

your title is commander but there's a

title that is I'm the chronicler all

right and it gives you some special

ability that I don't know what is yeah

some I have some vague ideas and I wrote

some of them down in that house but

you're just not currently using so you

could you could go store it on the

somnium to Everest we should probably

store it in something secure like I

think to prevent it from scrying we need

like a bag of holding or something is

that right

like cuz it puts it in a separate

dimension technically you mean should

prevent its location from being found

mm-hm

well I mean yeah that's that's a good

line of reasoning but probably anybody

who wants it is gonna assume that it's

with you guys the chain is so putting it

in a box putting it like putting it

putting into them even even if a bag

holding well I don't think it does even

though if even if a bag holding prevents

crying like they're just gonna assume

that you have the bag hold yeah like hey

we can't I can't I can't sense it but

I'm probably I'm pretty sure one of the

senior officers has it so if we know

where the senior officers are we know

whether we know what the chronical is so

you can put it on you can store it

somewhere else you could be put in a

bank but involved I'm thinking of it

this way if we if we store it somewhere

else it can get stolen and it gets

stolen

it gets someone without our knowledge

yep if we keep it honest anyone who

wants to try and take the chronical from

us has to take the chronical from us

true and I agree I just wouldn't have

said anymore

maybe wrap it up tight and put it in

your backpack or something as the maid

boy said oh that's right it's one the

boxes so you're picking off pieces of

microphone go beyond brand for me just

slowly be whittling away these things

idly sleep I didn't realize

so yeah okay all right we got the book

back yeah and now we know they are now

we know I already won what's your what's

your help at my health is fine oh sorry

no one cares how many hit points I Hey

you have infinite infant yeah you just

make up hit points correct I have yeah

that's spoken right yeah yep so yeah I

mean you you could you could just copy

the old text even though you can't read

it like I can't read this but I could

try to my best copying it but when you

do that you get you're just a lot more

prone to errors because it'll be some

detail about the way the letters are

formed so you're not gonna know this and

you're not gonna copy over and their

meaning changes sound like a duplicate

spell or something like that might be

actually I'm sure there is whether or

not it's in the players handbook or not

yeah just make a copy of it stash the

copy someplace safe just in case yeah we

could make friends to the broadsheets

[Laughter]

stories horse you shouldn't yeah so

after we kill the arrow that's okay yeah

sure well I mean I wrote his name down I

know you're talking about reporter yeah

you hear the you hear footsteps like

running footsteps and coming running

down the alleyway is the cop you folks

we're talking to him and she stopped so

she's she's like super out of breath and

she looks around and she's like uh-huh

are you gonna do your job they try to

steal from us damn can we file a report

sure she says she she's looking all that

she's kind of walking around looking at

the dead bodies and kind of nudging them

with her boot and she's like oh I'll

hand her the thank you

she says and takes the head of the

do you hand into her the headless body

or do you hand her the head the body

hold up the body yeah and she's a oh

great yeah thanks yeah we've got fewer

these back at the station and she's kind

of throws him to the side and she's like

counting how many of their work and

she's like experiment I have the head

she has but not so much engineering

which one of you is is it you are you

them can I talk to him she's like I talk

to you for a second sure

and then she's kinda stand a little bit

of little ways and she's like look you

know so a whole lot of people just saw

you guys do a whole bunch of weird stuff

and I don't know if you guys are casting

spells or not I'm not super worried

about that right now and they were

trying to steal your stuff but like you

know the people I work for they sort of

turned they sort of get uppity when

random mercenaries start trying to

enforce the law because no offense you

guys tend to be a lot less circumspect

about who gets in your way in what

happens to and she's constantly like

look up 42 and she's talking to you

right like she's like actually actually

actually actually all three of you call

three of you guys she's like you got it

shows I don't know you

I don't know you but I've known a lot of

people like you so you know just try to

keep the spell-casting under control you

know and she looks around she's like an

alleyway he's probably fine but out on

the promenade she's like it's just gonna

make your life harder in my life art

makes this and she looks at the looks at

the bodies on the ground looks at you

and she's like everybody he's a little

hurt I'll be fine all right try to keep

out of trouble

what can you tell us about these guys oh

yeah sure and she says the spring the

balance spring they're kind of a

mid-level guild they don't usually

operate in the stays so you might have

been in you might what she's is this a

Matt ISM or as she was about to say you

might have just been a

target there we go you might just have

been a target of opportunity like people

know you're here now they mention they

had a job apparently I steal something

from us

what book oh is that what they grabbed

she didn't see it she's like huh

what's special about the book it's our

history it's a magic no that's weird huh

well yeah taking that something that's

gonna cause us to do this well one of

the few things she's like I think maybe

we I know some people who might know

some people we could try to figure out

what they want they say she thinks one

of the body's good no they said they

were paid by some individual cores I

mean so he paid him right they're not

they don't they don't operators also

it's not them that's looking for the

book somebody else I mean she called she

says you know the watchman here just she

whoever she works she works for you no

way like she kicks one of the bodies and

she's like we've got all sorts of bits

and these things at back in station they

valuable ah not us mmm like I don't know

I've never really looked inside one of

them before are they valuable to this

watchmaker that you know of she never

seems to try to reclaim any of it mm-hmm

like sometimes she was like she was I'm

inclined to just leave these things here

and let the let the street clean this

take Moy not the nightsoil man grabbed

him and scavenged him and turn him into

something

she's like there could be copper she

there could be copper in there maybe

someone's valuable something no gears

may done a you know um there's a lotta

open up like I already did like so like

when you when you were just head off

like Springs and stuff and shootout but

if you're gonna dismantle one you're

gonna find a lot of crazy [ __ ] but

there's you know crystals and stuff in

there there are the courts are they Ruby

are they worthless are they valuable

like this cop is like she never

to recover rating the stuff just

abandons it worth it

maybe we should you know hang on to a

piece just in case

well we're just rip one open and see if

there's anything valuable inside doesn't

sound like anybody else this is inclined

to do so go for I would Howard I'm just

curious like what slimxpress that hmm

like that's him in a lot but I think

it'd just be funny if perhaps wouldn't

be like yeah we should render them down

for their valuables assume there's no

[Music]

search yeah go ahead and make a uh Wow

I'm out of it right now

perception check no it's searching yeah

is it investigation yeah I need a new

debt but that won't that I think my

problem is that this is gray so does not

have the information on it I need 20 so

okay yeah if you if you if you start

spending some time tinkering around with

this thing so she's just gonna make sure

you guys are make sure you guys are okay

right nobody got hurt we're fine and she

wants to make it well I guess another

question do you have a recommendation

for we should say tonight I thought we

were staying it looks like more

information I dream like I stay at home

alright well thanks just like she's

she's not she's like I'm not tourists

like I don't know like hey he live in

the city yeah I mean yeah that's that's

true but she doesn't know what hotels

are good hotels her she could probably

tell you well actually she's she could

probably tell you which places are safe

in which places not to go to because

we're actually I don't what are you

looking for I know we're a cops Co like

I know what the cops don't go

she knows like oh the letter

there's a place called the shadow Gio's

if you want to get a fight mmm that's

probably good place to go if you want to

what's this area called again this stays

this island is called the States yeah

and the section of it you guys are in is

called the promenade it's a it's a whole

district what are the different the the

state has multiple to multiple districts

right right what are the other ones like

what are the it's like a mercantil

district and so on and so forth or

what's the difference between the

different there is six different

districts there's a piazza which is

where you guys are right now hmm which

is a commercial place most of what you

guys see are there are places to live a

lot of the a lot of the stores have the

people who run them also living them

then there's scales which is a with a

lot of the fishing vessels dock and do

their trade and we're a Fisher gutted

and stuff like that and sold and bought

watch seafood is bought and sold there

there's the dogs or the dog leg or the

leg which is a residential area it's

I've got a little man it's very crude -

for the what I apologize for the critic

for the crudity of the model I didn't

have time - there's somebody online who

just based on the world-building strains

posted a map that they're working on

like on their way to work every day they

take the train and it's unbelievable

like the amount of detail this person

just invented and built into the map

maybe it was on the subreddit and I

contacted them and said hey I want I

want to buy your map from you and

they're like who it's not done let me

know it's done

but yeah so there's the dogs which is a

residential neighborhood it's pretty

poor there's the shavings which is that

where the Imperial Bank is it's pretty

it's pretty it's a pretty nice

neighborhood it's commercial there's

foxes which is an expensive residential

place like which people live there and

then there's la Rosa's which is actually

just north of here

is a where they do a lot of renderings

where the tanneries are in smells this

entire city smells bad well it depends

on what you like so what well you you

were about to tell me oh yeah so you uh

so you start and you know monkey well

you did you like a twenty yeah so you

are your your highness slim do this is

like brute force or are you trying like

are you trying to figure out how how the

mechanisms work or you just can't see

what's inside each is open and end up

looking for valuable okay so you're able

to kind of just pry the plates that make

up its body and a every time you like

probably one off it once it's free it

like breaks into a million wolf assets

right like they were held together at

one point but as soon as it's free of

the mechanism at all it doesn't

disintegrate into dust but tiny little

diamond shape panels and the insides are

this a weird combination of hydraulics

and rubber tubes and bladders and a wire

there's a lot of copper wire there are

bits that you're pretty sure like

titanium they're gears and stuff like

that there is a crystal in his chest

mm-hmm chest cavity that's currently

looks like dead it's just a piece of

glass piece of dirty glass one thing I

do want to ask the cop before she leaves

is you know we're obviously interested

in getting into the main cities so how I

just want to go about doing that bridge

okay do we know it need any kind of

additional paperwork

well she points to your weapon so she's

like you're not gonna agree you're not

gonna get through the guards there's

three bridges and there's bunch of

fairies but all of them have guards

you're not gonna be able to enter the

city without without surrendering your

weapons or I mean issues you could

become you gotta get like a knight of

the City of whom there are a lot mm-hmm

I have no problem with that so how does

one do that just gotta get some kind of

sponsored yeah is this that's not my

problem

so thank you for your help

well you were kind of a dick to her

people just meet the bare minimum

standard where where can we find that

neuro guy uh I don't know where he is

right now know where he hangs out

I know where he works for like he works

for the broadsheet guild but their

offices are on the mainland they don't

have a they don't have a office out here

on the Stu's well it's just like they

probably do yeah that's just I'm sorry

I'm not tour guide and she says you can

you know leave your mess here I'm sure

somebody'll come scavenge it and she

turns and leaves it was like this when

we got here okay so it doesn't sound

like there's really anything worth

hanging on to in this this me hate the

crystal but because it looks cool that

you put it in your hat

[Music]

[Laughter]

that's cool it's kind of like marking

off kills yeah yeah and collecting the

[ __ ] soul crystals of the clockwork

thieves of you I just like the idea of a

bunch of random things from people sweet

tap yep alright so now you guys have

endured some not very intensive

questioning by the cops and they have

they have split what is your intention

let's go three o'clock in the afternoon

permits right at its heart good good you

told me nice I thought we were gonna go

secure lodging yeah well you were the

captain said you guys are gonna go to

the Pharaoh's dreams that we want do you

know that's where I'm gonna go let's go

they're asleep but uh so meal well I

mean is it your I mean is it like do you

picture it as being like okay well let's

all stop working and go to our homes and

we'll and tomorrow 9:00 o'clock we'll

all become members of the chaîne again

so until then I don't care what you guys

do

no I kind of want to get the

the junior officers to go hang out at

another bar and see what kind of

information they can pick up okay that's

easy we could probably even have Angela

go to the shadow

he seems like type 2 they fit right in

yeah I don't know if we want some time

alone but I don't know what what are

your nails retainers I mean we could

send we could send ox and Roach along

with to Oxford angel

they're pretty yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna

be too worried about him let's go ahead

and do that

send them there and then we go to the

low profile whether I'm really

disorganized or I need a lot of time I

space a lot of surface area well if

we're gonna go to so how are you gonna I

guess I I don't want to make it tedious

for you guys to communicate with the

guys back on the ship but do you guys

when you say you know we'll have angel

dudes like it's not around like one of

you is gonna have to go back to the ship

and say hey can you take care of this

and then end up general store we can't

there's there's you can't buy magic in

States it's not that kind of and and the

places that you can buy magic they don't

like have signs out there and stuff you

got the noir guy to switch out a spell

well actually the problem is that like

yeah hmm I can guess sending like I

think ooh how about a spell like the

Navigator can only communicate with

people it up like clappity right people

is like Scott like a speakers like yes

if I recall correctly you guys spend

some time to find it trying to even talk

to it and I would I describe it doesn't

have a mouth it doesn't have yours all

right so it has no way of speaking it

has no way of hearing what you say you

have to be able to think at it and you

don't actually have to have me I don't

want that you just have to have a

powerful enough mind and the way you do

that is you have some psionic ability on

your care sheet

like if you have psionic abilities then

you are you are on the wavelength and

you can talk to the thing you don't

actually have that flippity but sending

ya dope is that a live ritual is a spell

you can I can so you can change out your

spell's it just takes time in fact a to

cat sending what level is it 3 that's

right that's that that's not why did I

take the stupid spells just like for a

third levels like yeah I mean I guess

there's a point where eventually if some

of you third a little slots you're like

why not take something yeah but no yeah

one or two

like probably better things you can do

with it but yeah it's definitely a

situational thing and if you can swap

out your spell's or like wait till

tomorrow morning like as it takes one

round to cast Oh

I mean I'm mark onslaught but okay it's

something like you do like ten minutes

per spell level or something my makeup

and no I don't I wouldn't bother it

right now and we can look it up later

yeah yeah the fact that it can be done

it's what's important yeah so yeah you

swap out a spell and you can cast

sending are you gonna do it here in the

middle Street or an alley or in the

alley

you already there's nobody like that to

the point that officer Xia was making us

yeah officer who said her name before

because I would have written it down I

said any better officer Cinzia you know

we have a thing we're gonna check that

it's it's a slim CI it's short rest it

spelled CIN zi a yeah I assumed that

that will this wall take enough time

that I can sneak a short rest in sure

like yep you guys let me know when you

just fiddle around with little bits and

bobs that came out of those guys yeah

stable I'll sleep in there with big

heavily well I'm sure that I can let her

let her in I don't see some friends of

mine broken into the Pharaoh's dream one

time a long long time ago but we had to

we had to sort of make some we had to

take out some loans from the costume

department you know I'm saying we can't

walk in there looking like this I knew

we could but we're not gonna really

accomplish much looking like what

looking like a bunch of uh you know a

bunch of career soldiers who have just

spent the afternoon

fighting hmm you're tell me I need to

get dressed up be seamless hat actually

the hats not a bad touch keep the

honeybee keep maybe change the totally

keep the head the rest of it good um

we're gonna need to work on definitely

there's a yeah yeah that's on Thursday

is this why you dressed the way you do I

mean not even this is gonna really fly

yeah I mean we gotta get we got to get

booted up did you that okay to the

madness montage as we fly in the closer

yeah

change it yeah a little blown fancy

pants if we're gonna like actually get

any service in this place all right well

straight roads the whole deal I'm get

them off what's up what's the medium

porridge option

Oh suddenly they want to hear the option

just too hot

we commander I'm not trying to talk us

out of this I mean I got close but I'm

not wearing a wig I mean you guys can

afford well I mean they're like a

fashion like you know like we're not

from here perhaps we can show off our

own fashion from places that were

tailors yeah can we just

yes we could just go there and be like

staying at the dream tonight just she's

ready just depends on how much guys

wanna spend we got some cash yeah

Treasury got some cash to burn it's like

Vegas now I've got I've got but it's

Linda's lives reaction another option is

that we send the well I was kind of

thinking it would be you and me that

would go there because to medium pour it

for your treasure we'll get you a

diamond tip cane so do the people

especially people like copper in charge

that have known you King for a while

do they know Kings like back story I

don't mean like his origins but like you

know like the the do they know whether

or not you were lower class middle class

upper class or is it like note bypass -

uh no I don't think they would but the

the reason I got my name wasn't because

I keep my stuff nice and I have nice

stuff that I brought it yeah that's

that's kind of the mocking thing that's

like what you think so

so King Kane has a reputation for

wanting to do spend money to have nice

stuff got it and keep us and keep his

stuff really nice and especially for a

mercenary an itinerant mercenary company

that's unusual because it's like

everything gets covered in dust and and

beat up I would say judge is probably a

little similar to that make sense to me

yeah I mean you're you're you're in hell

yes you're royalty nobility royalty

nobility yeah I mean like look what kind

of clothes do you need to wear I mean I

mean you can see there are

I look awesome we're gonna we're gonna

take you to a tailor

well you look around and like there's

definitely there's definitely a fashion

all right and or and Boots's stuff is

kind of out of date and not the most

expensive but it's the right genre puffy

shirts

well like really expensive doublets and

offed a lot of the guys a lot of the

more wealthy people you see on the

promenade have hoes you know as opposed

to like trousers hmm

and and and oh and they have great hair

like and and you've already seen at

least one guy who's wearing a wig yeah

but I mean like there's not a lot of it

like it's like so but I mean I don't

imagine like you've also it's it's tough

because you guys are from around here so

it's tough to kind of it's tough tip for

you to decode all the different people

you see on the promenade Piazza because

a lot of them are non-human and it's

hard to tell like which ones are the

rich ones which ones but there are

definitely among the humans and there

was definitely a style and the more kind

of explain you've already seen like one

guy the guy that took that carpet taxi

who does not dress like it was not

dressed like a real one at all but he

was wearing a lot of there was that

outfit cost a lot of money and so how

much do you think a lot what's gonna be

considered here I can't imagine it's

more than huh but we're told it's like

normal

okay I'll see you there I guess we'll

find out yeah do you know Taylor knows a

cobbler I know I I do know okay y'all

get boots Oh

[Music]

15 15 yeah there's a place called

Agostino Bonita happen yo it's uh it's

it's in the if not in the Piazza it is

is this like the Versace or or is like

Calvin Klein I mean not crying huh

what not crying yeah it's uh in the

shavings it's near it's near the bank

it's a it's a nice place banks where we

did the exchange yeah there's a lot of

kind of you passed a lot of upscale

places commercial places where's the Fox

is that income compared to where we're

all bloody and stuff yeah and you were

yeah yeah you're like it for context you

guys are about to go to like a five-star

hotel

mm-hmm looking like right and so like

one star I think it'd be fun to just

walk in there as is see what happens

[Laughter]

what's gonna what's gonna happen uh

they're just gonna give us the runaround

like it's gonna be that restaurant you

tried to go to and no way exactly

guys my address for this I said hi beep

my fella game developers like hey I like

it

it's the Palomino like these places like

look at the people in there and look at

us we are not dressed at a place and the

people I was with were like I don't

understand what you mean all right and

we spent like two hours just waiting to

get sat for lunch oh and I was like guys

I gotta go back and so I mean wow this

is this I slim slim Slim's up for it

it's an adventure

okay well yeah consider it a tactical

decision sounds interesting

we're infiltrating the enemy fortress

disguises which also happens to have

furnace Benson and that's so it's all

August he knows Benitez and Kevin knows

is a small place compared to the Bank of

you guys were the exchange you guys went

to which was like this almost like a

Roman temple was huge and tons of people

are doing business there this is a much

smaller kind of hole-in-the-wall place

and it has this elaborate sign it's just

that these three names with kind of

highly stylized ampersand

written in common over the door

and you can see in the through the

window that there is like really

expensive clothes here how much are you

thinking

slim goes in you open the door bell

rings and you see the there's um it's

like has Slim has Slim ever been to a

tailors before I doubt it

right so it's I mean it's from the

astral plane but I don't know that you

see a lot of weird [ __ ] normal [ __ ] yeah

this is gonna be your weird so it's it's

it's tons of cloths on display of

different colors and they're mostly like

wine colors and they're muted so they're

dark purples dark reds it's not like a

riot of color there's always like

obviously a certain kind of a tone is in

fashion and there are like these weird

headless legless bodies on poles that

are situated around and some of them

some I think I think of the the spring

voice yeah well it kind of looks like it

kind of looks like these might be the

models for those are some right and they

they're they're made out of some kind of

cotton like the stuff like pillows or

something and there's a couple of them

that have pieces of cloth on them with

chalk marks or almost like pinstripes on

them and various symbols almost like

arcane signals on these on these on

these unfinished pieces of clothing and

it's it's really musty in here it smells

like tobacco like somebody smokes I

don't know if I don't know if Sloane

knows what that smells like it's just

another weird smell a bunch of them on a

budget it's not bad sorry but this

wizened old dude who's bald and has like

he's bald on top and he's got these

Tufts

gray hair is when is when you when you

close the door he kind of sticks his

head out from behind of screen and he's

got like a measuring tape in his mouth

oh boy and he runs up but he's like

hello

and he has this kind of classic ryeowon

accent which I'm not gonna abuse we need

to get into the dream and and and what

are you my friend what can I do for you

I need a garment and then you folks come

in he's like ah officers officers yes

excellent yes this I understand yes I

like that

clothes please

[Laughter]

you use you sir Hugh sir humorous you're

something I can clearly deal with yes

good day he kind of wants to like I talk

to you for a second over here yeah so um

thank you for for choosing a christina

bonito in CHEM venue yeah you come

highly recommended am I to understand

that I will be outfitting a goblin and

an alien and a brute a fling uh well I

mean if you're not up to it we could

find somewhere else but well how I'm I

understand that as obviously military

military figures that there is there are

there are official dinners that you must

attend and you must be a pro

appropriately dressed yeah you got the

idea how much how much how much were you

thinking spending I prefer much do you

think this is gonna take I must say this

is a challenge this is a challenge I'm

happy I'm happy for the business you

know six people walking you know once

especially on an afternoon like this is

but at the same time we're gonna pinch

maybe a maybe maybe like maybe there's

maybe there's someplace better suited

for people of your dimensions I'm like

half the clothes did you have children's

clothes yeah this is a child's we're not

we have it so far we haven't yet had a

need for goblin children of any sort I'm

sure you we're like kids sighs that's

right yeah

can you point us in the direction of

someone who might be able to whip us up

some I mean let's just call it what it

is costumes well I mean you don't like

money I mean so is this like an

intimidation check is that this is a

slim me like what the [ __ ]

[Music]

it's it is it is I forgive me my friend

it is it is a challenge you don't like

challenges well then are you well one

one one that's not one that's not used

to one that's one that's used to it a

more local clientele is shall we say

I have two legs two arms a head the same

as all of these creatures yes very well

what what was it what was perhaps but

for whom do you need to dress he says

we're staying at the Pharaoh's dream

this evening ah ah surprise but like

well indeed yes very fine very fine

hotel one of the best in the city

and you need something appropriate

impress the concierge and get a good

room

okay well and what what time frame were

you thinking four weeks free tonight

three answers we need this expedited she

kind of twirls this yeah yeah well if

you're willing to buy something weed you

know sort of off the rack as it were not

get it fitted because obviously that

takes time do they have left on a rack

well they have he explains that they

have deals with other kind of less

upscale businesses and so he can he

could send a runner to go get stuff

right now and and kind of it would be it

would be the stuff he would get for rich

clientele and it wouldn't be it just

wouldn't be made to work if I hadn't get

he's like he can get you folks something

just question how much do you wanna

spend so the Pharaohs dream is very nice

place 419 gold pieces so he he's like

yeah picks it up he's like he opens

actually do you still have these are so

these are all actually real and coins

right and he kind of rummages around and

he's like how do you have your heart set

on the Pharaohs dream what would you

suggest something a little more

affordable perhaps well we're not

looking to stay the night there perhaps

so this isn't enough to stay in my

people to stay in the know for him to

for him to go get you outfits oh that's

just his money oh it's not enough for

one but he is the richest out of all of

us oh well and that's a difference

manhood if you're each talking about

spending several hundred goal and

absolutely he will take care

100% not spending so cool well how about

I guess we're going to the medium porch

man give my options you can go to the

stool we're gonna go sample the stool

that's what the call we should go to the

rich place because that's what the

people with the most money you're gonna

offer us jobs I mean it's called the

princess footstool well maybe only a

couple better that's kind of like the

issue is that like euros are be less

visible there right it's got more get so

much more obscure place as opposed to

the pros dream the Pharaohs dream is

famous throughout the city like the

Pharaohs dream is where visiting Nobles

would want to stay if they were gonna

stay in the inn the docks and it's it's

it's like it broadcasts say we're here I

mean are very easy for people to find

you folks you soon as guys a halfling no

no he's a short he's at the old in short

do you need to hire warriors no not on

this occasion King right what you're

saying is we don't necessarily stay at

the Pharaohs dream just well we don't

necessarily all need to go either it's a

couple people like a couple people could

get the fancy to go there get

information or something I mean I should

have clothes that'll pass in sure but

why do you want it like let me just like

why do you want to go to the Pharaoh's

dream if you don't want to go stay in a

really expensive place at this point I

don't know because everyone's telling me

I can't since it's a that's a perfectly

in character reason I want to go because

that's what the rich people are gonna

come in offer us jobs yeah okay well

then you that what so what I'm just what

you're saying is hey we want to be seen

to be rich people yeah yeah so you need

to look the part yep that's all yeah so

that's just gonna be expensive

I've got 400 gold burning a hole in my

pocket man yeah I mean we got the chip

we'll be all right

for Justin yeah for the 2000 gold was

that for for that much gold he's like

absolutely gold each well if you're each

if he was offering for her golden he

said I'm not for them so it's like okay

well that's was showing him how much

know they have had oh I mean I didn't

end up in the chain by beautif on scible

with my spending he thought you were

making a uh like get my money's worth if

I'm gonna give it all to him

well yeah that's that's that's probably

gonna take a little while he'll probably

have to have something I mean there you

probably can't spend more than 100 gold

each here on stuff that he's just gonna

go grab for you guys it's still gonna be

like our equivalent of really upscale

high brand stuff it's just not gonna be

it's not gonna be bespoke right but if

you want something bespoke if you want

something that is literally made for you

which would cost more but it'll also

give you guys like actual bonuses to

diplomacy check system with with people

you meet we'd have to wait you're gonna

it's well it's you know you can do both

you can be like here's some outfits for

tonight give me an hour

give me an hour yeah I'll get you

something and then come back in three

weeks and will that get you folks some

no he doesn't know your timetable mm-hmm

right that'd be pretty awesome like

that's like a super fancy vest with the

tall thin Haley and gentlemen might like

and he shows you this this really kind

of exquisitely embroidered with gold and

this this glimmering red thread and you

don't even know what is kind of doublet

that would fit slim well if Sir doesn't

like that we have other options we have

other options perhaps the gold is a bit

much something perhaps like would

complement sirs

natural complexion we'll find something

some nice greens and ochres I see you in

earth tones big-time yeah you're right

you're more of a Adalind autumn where I

thought we were the chain we red and

black are our colors that'd be cool oh

yeah absolutely he'll get you something

that

I mean so he's curious as to whether or

not you might be much silver it's a very

popular concert do you uh is this is

these are we looking for dress uniforms

are we looking for something more casual

or what is that sir do we get uniforms

generals of a great army well here's

what I'm thinking uh like word we're

gonna be spending some time on the stage

before we make it into the mainland

right like we want to be like I'm

assuming by the time we when we go to

the main then we want to be able to go

there with our weapons in tow correct

fancy so that we can work what if we

just had his runners pick us up

something that'll pass us off for like

the princess footstool put down put some

money down for yeah I think you said

there is the footstool is more like a

regular okay it'll like middle class

place you probably you'll probably still

get some attitude because you're still

still soldiers that are covered in oil

and sweat and blood but wash I mean we

can go lay on our exfoliating beds get

that all cleaned up that's true you

could go back you could go back to the

somnium to new person get new clothes

and like I should have closed on the

song I should have closed actually

clothes that are passable sure didn't

yeah we're gonna be here for more than

one night yeah so let's let's you know

put in an order for summits fancy super

fancy all right I like that idea

and then you know like I said he can get

you stuff within an hour that is like

really nice Brett you know

well expensive stuff it just won't be

custom tailored yeah I think I think

what you're saying is we we get the

customs tailor stuff we're gonna be here

a while

eventually I prefer the unique well I

think yeah they're saying we should get

some custom tailored stuff for the

future the future yeah help once we get

to the main city and yep yeah you know

going something guilt that's true that's

true like a like the you guys are gonna

be your plan as far as I understand it

it's gonna be is gonna require you to

interface with a probably a lot of

different factions and some of them are

like what

everybody everybody in capital seems to

have a noble title even just random

noise yeah so kind of looking the part

is gonna have a big impact so you spend

the money and you will eventually like

in three weeks you'll get custom clothes

that will give you bonuses to your

negotiation checks is they'll probably

get you into places you wouldn't

otherwise get into but you can get you

something in today right now that'll get

you into the Pharaohs dream without

anybody complaining that's you and

that's gonna cost you hundred I'm saying

get the clothes tonight but then get the

custom tailored stuff for later the like

he'll make you a deal

like I kind of a package deal and I'll

do all of that for 250 gold each make it

200 each then it's done well you guys

make a roll like it's a guy to go ahead

I rolled that d4 that's fine yeah for

you divinely-inspired

plus 1029 remember offering 250 here

he's 200 seems he remembers offering 200

at this point he's like yeah yeah 200

got nowhere else so if you guys hang out

here for an hour he comes back with ya

he summons a page and he has they gives

the page of much money and he says go

here and buy this coherent eye this go

get some go get some poems from these

guys die and then he's like you're

welcome and he brings out a tray with

wine on it and there's a little like

really nicely upholstered chairs if you

folks to hang out in I'm sorry I

apologize it's been it's a we're not

used to serving such August personages

such as yourself it's decent

so an hour goes by

and this page comes back with a big

stack of clothes yeah and the the tailor

goes through it and starts mixing and

matching and starts saying you sir this

all and gives you clothes that are

appropriate for I like these clothes oh

really hmm they make you look like a

peacock okay right they're very

flamboyant I've never seen anything like

it yeah I think it's amazing yeah

they're definitely a heroes héroes

clothing great me for a great warrior

exactly makes you think you've been

great things like no no just there's

it's a lot compared to what you're used

to wearing I see it's just a lot of

different colors and kind of

ostentatious filigree and you know big

puffy shoulders and stuff like that yeah

so this is gonna be interesting if

anybody's watching God knows but maybe

watching this is the cat thing or if we

get this like this would be pretty

amazing

so like so now like so he's gonna have

your armor he's like I'll have your

armor taken to the hotel it'll get there

before you folks do that's right great

with little gems on me bedazzled yeah I

can't wear my armor with it it's not

it's I mean no it's not you're it's not

designed to be worn over plate well

we'll just I guess you could try like

you could you could you can like crush

the clothing underneath your armor and

then it would get but the front thing

right and you just got the shoulder

stuff in the arms and your legs I mean

the leg parts would fit over the hose it

would ruin the cut of them is the tailor

this is it's like what like that that

idea of like wearing your armor on it

doesn't make any sense to him but he's

like maybe you're like a motorcycle gear

where it's like it's got armor built

into it

you can't could you like maybe a

blacksmith no no III think slims he's

gonna try it yeah okay yeah I mean well

because because like you said he's

wearing hose right well in this case

yeah like you don't have to because so

the bottom the Greaves would go on sure

yeah yeah that's fine yeah I guess yeah

like it's a Slim's way of doing it right

it's like yeah okay great thanks for the

clothes awesome world exactly okay okay

yeah so so so those the rest of you are

aware that slim looks oh yeah absolutely

yeah he's admiring himself in the mirror

cool yeah you look great and you said

he's like it's unusual he's like it's

not watched it's ridiculous but he's

like it's now getting close to like 5

o'clock and he's like strange we haven't

had any customers while you were here

it's unusual especially on somes gonna

go into great detail about the kind of

clothes that he wants him to make okay

I'm not gonna do it but yeah I guess I

wanted to do this I wanted to be

discovered in this color

I wanted to work with the armor okay

well he's gonna he's gonna walk you

through the whole of the story he's

gonna show you he's gonna he's gonna

make sure that that he is picking out

fabrics and styles and colors that you

want so it's not just gonna be able to

take notes easily so just to sir like

this or would sir prefer this or and so

do you were here like he's like velvet

well alright fine sure yes absolutely

but there are some choices this one

makes a discovery

yeah so yeah you hear the the tailors

sometimes kind of amazed at Slim's

basically as big as a horse yeah that's

what I'm thinking

then we could carry it with us do you

one bigger yeah it's not very fancy just

something I like the idea of big cat

walking for the streets with fashion

fashion bags being held at his tentacle

least then it's on us rather than well I

actually made a lot of money to this guy

his page runs off with our [ __ ] only

thing he's gonna run off with it but he

stories of greatness

yeah you guys are now in your custom

tailored outfits from fine not your

custom daily office you're off the rack

stuff from a fine ryeowon tailor and it

fits really well considering the fact

that it wasn't made for you so this is

the image of us walking out of that

place I shoot hole videos and then I

watch it out towards I'm like I'm

covered in cat hair yeah so yeah then so

you guys work off the money I did okay

actually you only need to mark off like

half but does you'll pay the other

little bit uh one you get it it'll be

depositing you'll pay the other half in

three weeks and he'll have somebody come

to the Pharos games don't know where

we're going or not here all right so

mark up 200 I wrote a post on reddit

about how like the campaign diaries are

it's too much it's too much work for me

because I have to edit them over the

weekend and that sucks on what I'd like

that my weekends back but I feel

suddenly really motivated to do really

interesting so yeah you guys know you're

where you are well outfitted you look

amazing it's uh it's that the colors are

mostly red black and silver but not

exclusively because it was all kind of

what we could what they could find so

the custom tailored stuff you guys are

gonna get is actually gonna look like

official chain like uniforms livery yeah

yeah but this stuff this stuff it's more

thematic it's not goes there is there a

glasses shop during the way

oh yeah hundred percent you're big

when you walk out because like it's just

me big guy kind of like presses its nose

right right up against you like you can

get hair off and then starts like doing

this thing where she kind of go and you

see you see and copper like rat like the

giant tentacle panels kind of grabbed

copper and push copper into the into the

into big cat's face and then and then

the tentacles pick you up and put you on

the back of big cat and you're back in

the saddle so it's been I won't be this

way for long don't worry and you folks

now dressed to the nines head over to

the to the Pharaohs dream the Pharaoh's

dream is one of the largest buildings

you've seen so far in the stays it's a

five-story hotel and the whole thing is

designed to look like it was teleported

here from Komara like it's it's themed

right it's kind of Luxor it's like well

I've better examples but yeah the Luxor

if the Luxor was like the best hotel in

New York or Egyptian Caesars Palace yeah

and there are there are Porter's outside

who are assisting people with baggage

and stuff because there are littered

that show up looters are you know like

carts carts pulled by people instead of

horses right and they're showing up on

offloading guests and as you like there

are people of all different backgrounds

coming and going from the for ei which

is large but they're all yeah they're

all dressed really well and in fact

they're all dressed but way better than

you folks are now like any tea flames ah

no sorry that was an undue amount of

commentary on my part yes there's merely

no not ha that was a world building

[Laughter]

I'm suddenly in a really good way yeah

but so there are people coming and going

and there are so like you don't need a

perception check for this I'm sure one

of you will notice like there are

because of the caelian empire you can be

a human from anywhere and you can look

like anything you can be from any ethnic

background and be from any part of the

world so but this is the first time

you're really seeing apart from the

banner man you're really seeing like Vaz

lorian's who are not real and they're

they're bad laureate they're like as

lórien wealthy Vaz lorian's are here and

there are wealthy the gardens coming and

going and then also a bunch of Lego

stuff it's their own it doesn't seem as

though there are a lot of native Rio uns

it's mostly people from how to film and

yeah what what what do the people that

look better than us what are they doing

different that's good like that we're

not doing well make a make a perception

shot I want to look to 21 let's be

that's pretty good actually at no 23:23

easy but their stuff is is so the stuff

you're wearing it's still off the rack

well so it looks good well right it

looks better than the people like on the

street yeah but these guys have spent a

lot of money to look good on purpose

this is kind of like what you imagined

your custom-tailored stuff's gonna look

like when it shows up right so keep mine

fits perfectly well and they spend a lot

of money it's all about conspicuous

consumption right the people that are

staying at this hotel want you to know

how much money they spent you guys just

want to look good that's what you could

in the time frame you had right right we

just want to look good right right so

you guys look good but these folks are

wearing like furs and stuff like that

and they'll have canes and all sorts of

a coot Ramon that are really wealthy and

they're all different backgrounds like a

Goren's where a lot of silk right and

the Baz lorian's don't use silk Basile

ourian's have a lot of furs and stuff

like that but

yeah it's about conspicuous consumption

they're not wearing an elemental bone no

there and there's not they're not gift

and they're not gift or goblins or and

in fact like as soon as like a really

tall thin dude and a red skinned person

is one thing cuz that's still like

humanoid but copper and big cat like

it's a [ __ ] displacer piece you guys

show up this hat and you can see as you

guys are walking down the street you can

see this huge hotel and you're in a nice

part of town and it and people are

looking at you and like people like

getting out of the litters but they'll

get out and they'll look at the porters

and the porters are like and the people

getting out of litter will be like what

Yeah right and they like scurry scurry

in like let's get inside let's get

inside and you enter I assume and the

for yay is no expense has been spared to

impress upon you but no expense has been

spared right so there's palm trees

growing in here right everything's gold

and cut like a gold I want to say

gold-plated everything's made of gold

and sandstone and everyone who works

here is dressed like that come on like

somebody from the infinite desert and

that is they are they're bald and the

[Music]

concierto and there's a there's like a a

desk like it's like a modern hotel and

there was a concierge a little check you

in and the concierge is looks like he

came from the infinite density it says

deep copper skin and he's got he doesn't

have the he doesn't look like he's

ethnically kamorin but he has he's

wearing makeup

he's worth like the the crazy makeup

that they wear their this heavy Rouge

and eye makeup and stuff and there was a

lot of people in this coming and going

from that for you it's huge is it like

tall she wasn't like yeah I know yeah

it's it's like there's there's palm

trees it's also the top of there's a

dome at the top which is not strictly

speaking authentic architecture for that

region

but there are a lot of these square

holes going through the dome that light

in so it's it's it's getting close to

early evening so the light is kind of

thin and orangie but yeah there's still

a lot of light and air there's a lot of

air flowing left through here the floor

is very expensive tiled it's a fresco

it's like a it's like a this piece of

art that is a well annotated Player's

Handbook how people see in your place

handbook and I will tell you but that is

a very effective like I there are times

when I am wanting something up and

grabbing Anna's Player's Handbook means

that I able to find it really quickly do

that oh oh

because right after I rolled you 20 was

on your desk I was gonna say so yeah I

could just see Matt like walking around

the office when nobody I did I did roll

I did I did

I can't I put my hand up like this Tom

Kenny yeah I did roll Tom's dice a

couple of weeks ago just to try it out

and [ __ ] anyway this gay banter so you

guys are reasonably well dressed and so

what do you what are you gonna do with

big cat what are you gonna do with this

this [ __ ] displays a beast in mice in

my city that I built from scratch Tom

and you're gonna drag this like the

[ __ ] salt I'm gonna wreck it

that wreck your city then what kind of

rule builder are you looking this place

would be round so puts hours of dynamite

everywhere

I imagine well we'll see we'll see if

they have a stables or something I one

of the porters asks politely if he could

take serves Mount where you gonna take

this we have stables maybe you should go

with them

yeah well I think we cats gonna listen I

don't think I even want to be separated

from I'll go with you check it out I'm

sure I I assure you sir it's perfectly

safe oh it's not it's not because of

that uh what manner of Beast is this

might I ask you're talking to somebody

who is looks like looks like an ancient

Egyptian just teleported out from like a

Disney movie right he's wearing he's

like no one else on the street is

dressed like this by the way only people

who work there only people who work here

like this

I'm just your standard cat mr. stainer

cat he does know he does ask what manner

of Beast is this sir I mean I assume

it's okay it's a it's a very it's a very

you tries people I so it's a very

remarkable choice sir I fed it well so

yeah I grew up being strong well if you

if you'd like to accompany me to the

stables just to just to you know you're

not though you're not the first person

as strange as this is this guy just

let's not miss me speaking strangeness

this is you're not the first person to I

want to make sure that there mount was

well treated and when I inspect the

stables so he's perfectly happy to take

you around to the side because there are

there are people who stay here like just

overnight and then they go to the city

proper because I it's like we just spent

this all this time on a boat I don't

want to spend hours in the city I just

want to go to a nice hotel and they have

their mount with them because the

streets here are probably too narrow to

really use mounts on but knots not rude

cap

capital there horses no conceal all

right so yeah this is yeah so he's

perfectly happy to lead you to the

stables there are some I'm

I think if there was anything exotic

here besides just horses I don't think

there is but there are stables of

different sizes and there are lots of

people working the stables are there any

dog dog no no not not currently but

there are small stables as though

something like 1/2 wings a halflings

mount whatever that might be a tiny

horse yeah exactly

you're so cute wait ponies aren't baby

horses I was a reddit thread about what

didn't what the stuff didn't you know

and the one of the top answers was I did

not know that ponies were not just small

horses they're like another breed of

horse that never get and the response

after that was something Kody's art I

thought a point was worth no pulse

it's a different breed I thought that

all ponies grew up to be big words yeah

also our mutual friend Jason was angry

at me when I said that I had never seen

a horse like in person like apart from

being in my car at a stop sign at

Knott's Berry Farm when when they apart

from that that's it he's like he didn't

believe me

anyway enough about me what were you

talking about yeah so that I mean are

you committed to like staying with your

cat your cat will do what you tell yeah

okay so big cat will do what you tell it

and it might not enjoy it yeah and but

it's it's you know it's alright it is

sorry it's I think I haven't looked at

you have the displacer beast yeah we see

this place a beast info it's gotta be at

least as smart as a horse right well

it's got an int of six which is like as

an int of six is like as smart as a dumb

human yeah right

so and I think that's probably smarter

than a dog I think a dog is gonna be

like a three or four I don't know I'm

not an expert on right now at the top of

my head I couldn't tell you what a dog's

intelligence wasn't indeed but it's it's

smart and it's it's loyal you might not

like it yeah don't talk to it and I'd

pull some you know some snacks from

from my pouch and okay you told stay

yeah I'll stay I'll I'll be back just

for a short while

don't eat the horses don't eat it don't

yeah yeah don't eat anything the other

horses aren't dead they don't like this

and so they lead they lead they show you

where big cat is gonna be staying it's a

wide berth it's it's a Scott there's hay

and it's for horse but it's for a big

horse and it's away from the other

horses it's really busy there aren't a

ton of mammals here there was probably

16 different stalls and only three of

them are occupied right now and reminds

you of back when you were looking at the

jail cells on the somnium 2 networks

make the same kind of layout right

except instead of a gif and a mind

flayer there's a there's horses and the

horses you can hear the horses don't

like it and the groom is like don't

worry we'll take their license and their

and the groom though so the porter has

led you here but there's a groom there's

a guy who's in charge of the stables and

he is just amazed a big cat like

everyone else freaks out not this guy

this Cossack aw come here you big beauty

monster that big cat big cat like you

did you try and pet him right now

he'll try it yeah definitely well he's

gonna be he's gonna be the one taking

care of the cat yeah yeah so he's

definitely gonna like each other like

this she likes oh yeah yeah and be kind

of like this guy's got natural and it's

his job to be good at animals so big cat

tolerates it and and he lead big cat

into the still open the stall and big

cat kind of does this one too yeah kind

of like settles down makes a little Bowl

as I think I think we all have yeah

so because happy to just take a nap here

and we'll let you know sir will sir be

staying

that'll be staining yeah so will will

you know I mean in a stable they'll be

staying here oh you will we wait well

nothing well we'll let you know if

there's any problems with your does does

serves amount have any special dietary

needs fish eazy-e quite easily acquired

lots of fish well it is a very big cat

is a very big cat

so are you do you wanna stay with big

cat I'm gonna go I'm gonna go back okay

for now okay but I but I want to be cat

does not seem to put up a fuss like once

you like big cats happy to suspect you

know he knows them well there are three

horses here now who knows how many

little be the morning

so a copper comes back now to mount las'

catless looks like a million bucks

feel weird right now use these things

twigs

it's definitely weird cuz because on on

big cat copper is probably the tallest

of a baby in the group because big cat

is it big gets think it's bigger so well

there's two things you know second he's

a cat and so it's weird to see copper go

around being um maybe maybe apart from

slim maybe he's the same height this

limb now by far the shortest and

smallest how tall are you without yeah

just on your own down something short

like are you yeah whenever as tall as

but I'll tell her nine-year-olds three

feet there three times okay yeah so it's

so yeah short yeah yeah but big top hat

yeah so yeah the concierge is it this is

probably gonna be a like a requires some

skill checks to get this guy to he

seiz'd you coming from kind of mile away

he's like

welcome to the Pharaoh's dream how can

we help you we'd like to book rooms and

did sir have a in three weeks yeah I see

your room with my dad but it's gonna

constantly tingle that's fine and you're

gonna have you're gonna have this

experience of like they're not there

actually I take it back

like there are goblins in the city okay

there are goblins in the city and so

it's not like it's not like holy crap

what the [ __ ] is that

yeah the I attitude you get from the

Taylor from the porters is more like why

is there a goblin here though right so

it's not like oh my god there's a

monster here it's more like don't you

guys have your own city somewhere or

like underground or something well it

must be just in life or drought right

the layers yes

well you saw a goblin actually kind of

having this heated heated argument as

with a frost giant yeah but they seem to

kind of be like um like you know

colleagues or whatever and what types of

rooms were Sir interested in officer all

of our rooms that come with an adjoining

water

well they using he's like a water table

there's tub short for something

tub a--they okay I just call him faff

right a bath yeah probably

I'm trying to think of like there's more

jargony way of saying it but says all of

he says all of our rooms come with a

bath and it serves request you're each

of everybody everybody here it gets

assigned like a servant basically that's

included in the cost and they'll come

and they'll make sure that when you want

to take a bath there's hot why they

don't obviously they don't have running

water that's ridiculous but they will

come and they'll provide hot water and

they'll you know that's just normal part

of fancy hotel here so so all of our sir

will be glad to learn that all of the

rooms at the Pharaohs room oh by the way

the sign of the Pharaohs dream it says

the Pharaohs dream on the sign which is

something that's in this reality unique

to capital like most most signs is like

it all signs in black bottom or just

there's no words on it it's just a

picture right but here it actually says

the Pharaohs dream and there's kind you

know that that the mask of Tutankhamun

that's what it looks like except the

eyes are closed and there are stars

around him is the font the parties the

font is not papyrus that would be very

gauche no no it's not Comic Sans stop

virus now the tactical stream not

getting a lot of oh hey by the way Jerry

can you hear me yes did did we try out I

know you said you were interested in it

but it seems probably ambitious to try

tonight

isn't that which roll out that thing

they did the restriction everyone has to

be a partner ah not just our second

stream so twitch those of you if there's

anybody watching there's anybody hook

I'm sorry there's anybody watching

twitch has a new function which lets

multiple streamers all kind of jump into

some kind of Simon so you could be

watching any one of their different

streams and get that kind of I don't

really know a lot about it jurors

looking into it but it might be the kind

of thing that makes our hey everybody we

have a second stream by the way it's so

you can see the battle a lot easier I

don't think it's gonna get a lot of play

tonight we'll see depends on how late we

play it so he'll mean they are to the

concierge you know so yeah I mean they

have they have you know several

different classes of room going from

like for Goldeneye 210 goal tonight

what's ten gold get you a penthouse like

a suite it's like an apartment basically

it's like an apartment and your servant

is there the whole time like you're

you're like your servant is gonna come

and like knock on your door in the

morning make sure you make sure you get

woken up right and you're serving as the

ones gonna take your order and make sure

that you have the food that you want but

like they're they're going to visit

certain times of the day and check in on

you but if you got the penthouse there

they're just they're constantly yep yep

and they they will they will well you'll

see what happens if you get a penance

one well I want one too so yeah don't

make a make a host who's taught who's

doing the talking

I love that George this is copper yep

like so he kind of he waffles and he's

like I'm not sure that will be it is

with short notice you didn't book ahead

I assume oh no I'm afraid not

actually I'm not sure how you would do

that you would probably you know website

send a servant no yeah you would do

would you would traditionally like you

would use like a diplomats pouch and use

a servant and a lot of the nobles that

stay here have have agents in the city

I should use magic like casting spells

my arm and these guys have they have

plenty of licenses yeah they're all

caught up on their licenses they're up

to code yeah they are kind of percent

he's like it mmm he's like he actually

he actually looks at the five of you as

like mmm sir it might be difficult such

short notice

to get five adjoining penthouse rooms

for for joining penthouse rooms perhaps

sir would be happier with something more

on the ground floor toward the back of

could persuade you to perhaps check the

check the ledgers a second time or what

a certain play uh well you know I could

this is this is a business that runs on

runs on gold I will assure you sir that

we are well supplied in that department

Jack I talked to Jason no

at Lehman I mean you don't have to you

don't have to act it out you can make a

check if you just want to like negotiate

but uh okay I think I think use this and

Illinoisans of a like I'm a marquis and

you're gonna double-check and make sure

you can get us some pet houses go ahead

yeah you're dating you're a four-time

twenty nine yeah damn cheese so I mean

this is not this is I'm actually uh no

yeah it is as a supernatural ability

right in the sense that you have you

have you have unearthly intimidation

that's what forked tongue gets you and

so there's a magic but there is a

overpowering force of character coming

off of judge when he turns this ability

on right and you can all you've seen it

how about you you haven't seen it but

you guys you guys have seen it many

times before and it's like holy crap and

yeah it works on the guy yeah sure yeah

he's like oh I'm I beg your pardon sir I

was not I was not I was not aware of

your noble heritage please pray forgive

me we will ensure that serves get the

rooms that they have asked for just to

give us just give us a few moments get

the Rose Parade make it quickly Freddie

been waiting too long

thank you thank you very much a twenty

nine right so yeah if he's super

interested in helping you nor discount

ask makes you wait that long look the

presses are the prices speak to his

manager I almost brought drop that in

but I heard we'll just try this first he

brings up he brings out a ledger and

asks you each to sign by checking Oh

will sirs be requiring anything during

your stay this is my pleasure not to do

- he writes it in gear

but there was a really [ __ ] cool like

if a by the way those of you watching a

brief announcement strongholds and

followers is now available on fantasy

grounds and it's taken as long as it's

taken because I'm a busy dude and there

were whole MIT there were many steps in

the process that I should have gotten to

earlier and I didn't I apologize my

fault entirely

the folks at fancy grounds were super

cool and I quite like fantasy grounds

I've used it many times and one of the

things I liked about it we were using a

fourth edition was that you could decide

to speak it you could enchant you could

speak in your language like I don't know

if they had gift mm-hmm but they might

uh they definitely had like infernal you

could say so you could do a slash

infernal and then speak something press

return and the other players you know

connected to the game if their character

sheet said they spoke infernal they saw

what you said in English otherwise it

was in a unique script they're like

different script different scripts for

elvish and dwarvish and infernal it was

really cool like that's just a tiny

little detail that I just thought when I

saw that I was like this is cool yeah

yeah and it does a whole bunch of like

automated stuff like that we're checks

your character sheet and goes up yep you

can you understand this so yeah

strongholds and followers is available

and there were people on this is kind of

more for a twitch chat or campaign diary

there were people on the subreddit who

were like it's the same price as the

regular book and I'm pretty sure that we

could have charged less for it but I

honestly honestly was so busy that I

never got around to doing that work so

we'll see what happens with the next

book you may be able to do something

with that sport but again I thought so

actually now is probably good time for

you guys to take a break they're gonna

they're gonna get your rooms prepared

but they're also this guy wants to know

if there's and we can think you guys can

think about this bar eating some healthy

snacks if there was anything you guys

wanna join the concierge at like he can

get you tickets to shows there is not a

lot of that kind of thing in the stays

right the stuff in the stays tends to be

mostly tourist trap II because this is

where this but then he can it he doesn't

know what your plans are

hee hee hee we got an alkie mouse yeah

let uh let us know if anybody comes to

speak with us

certainly sir yes absolutely aye sir is

there in anticipation of receiving a

message yes

you know who I guess we tell them who

they are

oh yeah [ __ ] cuz it works really happy

people we assume people are gonna talk

to us I mean we've done things like this

before the whole point of being here is

kind of like right being broadcasting

the notice right sirs are not the first

high-ranking generals state oh really

who else have you had EP lists like he

lists a couple of as Laurie and Dukes or

like those guys are basically like kings

and yeah he I Matt doesn't know if the

doctor said but yeah he lists great

commanders data he says he he just

throws out he's like Ajax stayed here

when he was a young man before he began

his study at the University Rosie up to

these days it's my understanding that

he's he's gone to great things we hope

someday to have him back I don't know we

kind of her to you as a weiner we're

gonna take a break 10 or so minutes and

then we will come back and see what

happens more adventures at the Pharaohs

dream mmm you have to hit the button for

the break oh yeah I did the button for

the break Star Trek Star Trek it just

worked

Jerry says press the button it will just

it will just work so well thanks for

sticking around folks this is the point

at which we like to hang out for a few

minutes and check out the fan art so

that people have created we are it's

kind of ridiculous ow

we're literally just a bunch of nerds

sitting around playing the indie and

what I think of as being up

typical manner and inspire in spite of

that in spite of that there's some some

people that engage with the content and

just make some extraordinary stuff and

before we roll the fan art like can you

folks see this flag like holy crap like

where's the letter so we got two actual

things that people sent us both of which

are pretty cool

this one of which is amazing this is

from Adelaide Adelaide you're the

standard sewed like made like that's

handmade that thing is handmade and when

I saw that first of all when I saw that

I was blown away I was like oh my god

it's beautiful like we should go to a

show and carry that around we should go

to like a pack some point or something

and you'll know you'll know where Matt

is kind of literally carry the fact that

anybody made it at all is amazing to me

and the fact that I don't know a house

you would do it but yeah fact that was

handmade completely blew my mind yeah so

thank you very much young lady that is

that is crazy and I have six of these

little guys here and see if we can get a

shot or on the tactical stream we

turtles like I don't know what I

honestly genuinely have no idea what we

did to deserve something that I mean

it's awesome but that is that is cooler

that banner forgive me for saying this

that banner might be cooler than our

stream now unfortunately thanks to one

of our viewers

thanks to Chuck I think the chains gonna

have to fight some more giant spider

riding bloggers because I've now got six

of these giant Spidy Spidy writing dois

are 3d printed and like well now people

send him in this is probably a bad

precedent to send if you sin if you send

me painted minis I'm probably going to

use them against the earth but I super

in it's super inspiring and sent amazing

and yeah so thank you very much Chuck

this is super cool I'm constantly amazed

like I I feel like we live in an age of

miracles and people don't really

understand or take around like like you

can just make this you can yeah a

relatively normal person can 3d model

something and then go send it off to

shape ways or get a 3d printer and just

make stuff and so like yeah we're

definitely in a golden age of content

creation so we also get tons of fan art

actually for me it's way more to keep

worry more than how do I get back to

there we go it's often way more than I

can keep up with and so so one things we

like doing is showing off the fan art

and getting a raised reaction to it so

some of the stuff I have seen some of

the stuff I'm sure I have it so we're

curious to see what comes up [ __ ]

classic lines just looking down and I'm

like what yeah this is amazing so we've

seen earlier parts like and I love the

fact that like I did not know that this

was gonna be the chain of acheron

arrived in capital I didn't know I

didn't know what was gonna happen after

nails I didn't know it was gonna happen

it's gone oh yeah that's cool that's

doable lightning-like

yeah yep and the signal on his shoulder

Manos this I saw yeah this is the chase

disease like I'm right about to get

smack in the face yeah yeah yeah you can

see big cat and caught arrow jumping

over that I love that that chase scene

works pretty well all these I don't like

it's a thankless job

oh great I just love like the kind of

cartoon Capri so yeah

erica is too cute like that's it's blue

I have not seen this wow that's crazy

well no I think blow is it I see I

thought she was telling us she missed us

yeah I like mine brusca I'm curious to

know like what happened to blue like is

she gonna just I think she's just gonna

I know she did you guys didn't really go

out of your way to try Marquis tabasco

he would have you flogged OD fanart even

though it's just way I'm looking at

boots right now I'm just like oh this is

really cool I love this stuff this is a

little ceremony where everybody through

the montage so yeah this is an artist's

represented interpretation of two shoes

and just one of them the person who drew

this just had this imagine that if

you're a if you're a Phaedra this is

what I belongs to get your own that two

shoes probably has to deal with a lot of

crap because she's she's just like he's

nut caramel he didn't know it was that

yeah I yeah I remember the first time

and a caramel apple I was like a

teenager I was like these are amazing I

would eat them all the time yeah but the

first caramel sausage you get yeah well

that's because I have a sneaking

suspicion that it's awesome no I mean I

definitely

it's like sweet me put syrup on sausages

a Halloween treat I'm sure Holly yeah

that is what we're giving away and we

come a new trick or treat we're gonna

give away so you guys are at the

Pharaoh's dream which is the best hotel

in stays and the concierge thanks to

judge announcing is his noble heritage

and the fact that he is legitimately an

old woman from hell has quite changed to

the concierge just editor toward the

motley group of pretty well dressed

people in front of him so Lars was

asking about this this is an opportunity

for you guys to do downtime stuff but

don't worry too much about like you

don't have to come up with something to

do and you don't have to worry me if you

want to do something the concierge will

figure out where is the best place to do

it and if it's possible and then I will

probably scurry away and figure out what

are the actual mechanics of going and

doing that thing and it may take weeks

right and that could just be something

happens you can tell me offline you can

tell me in chat or whatever but I know

that King there's a church here there

are there's there are local churches in

the stays or every almost every region

in Fez Lauria there's not not every God

from that region right so there's

probably one Church to a dune or caval

in the stays and that's the only church

from vaz Lori in the area but there is

one so there is a church and it is a

Hagar and God and it is the god you

serve so in your downtime if you want to

go over there and say hey how do I get a

magic license that's your best chance

and the concierge you like you probably

already know that so you don't need the

concierge for that we'll just tell you

where the church is

but the concierge by the way his name is

Neb Carr a the concierge will be happy

to kind of anything you folks need or

want let him know and he will do his

best to accommodate you otherwise he

will have it takes about half an hour or

you guys to get your rooms

and you'd notice that other people come

in and book rooms and they seem to get

their rooms right away but after half an

hour Porter comes down and asks to

escort you to your rooms and the

penthouse that they're out the fifth

level and they're like apartments right

there's they're there several different

rooms and there is a there's each one of

them has a kemar and looking a person

usually in their late teens early 20s

that is what kind of belongs to the room

and it is eager to help you with your

clothes get things washed wants to know

if you're planning on dining in your

room if you're planning on dining in one

of the restaurants there's four

different restaurants and hotel key in

the restaurants what are the restaurants

they're nice there is one that's ryeowon

there's one that's Kim Horan and then

there are two that are kind of like I

don't know how we how they would

describe it but they are food from more

than one region in the world this one

that's the seafood it's all all just

seafood from from because like there's a

ton of fishing done in and around

capital and in fact there's like a whole

there's a whole region like consider

like Western Europe there's a whole

region that is fed by the fisheries from

capital and there's a fourth one get

some seafood uh let's let's go to the

reopen one because if people coming down

from capital I was thinking they gotta

have the best kamar and fitted right

because it's Pharaoh's dream but I mean

my vote goes to Rio and food it's been

walked up notes notes notes oh wait

there's actually I have a thing

bob has a thing we're going to the real

place

there's a menu amania there is there's a

menu the prices are all wrong did you

actually make a menu yeah thanks

well I wrote down what you can get and

and and how much it costs smokes the

smoked salmon salad

there's a beef and ginger and cinnamon

stuffed mushrooms with thyme cream

cheese there's a bunch of stuff it's all

really rich expensive food nothing

nothing eventful you guys you guys are

if you come down to so if you guys are

arriving in early evening you're each of

your they're called body servants each

of your body servants is eager to make

sure that you are you feel refreshed and

wants to know if you want appointments

for dinner and they'll coordinate

between because your rooms are all kind

of adjacent to each other and each of

theirs if there are four rooms each pair

of rooms are connected so you can't get

from room a to room D we can get from A

to B and C from C to D and why did it

take so long we're not I asked one of

the men I asked Slim's manservant he's

he's like this he's kind of super like

holy crap

it's an alien right so he's doing his

best to kind of maintain maintain his

composure around this otherworldly being

and he's like they're sure they're

probably just not used to serving just

not used to finding accommodations for a

man of your imposing stature hmm yeah

that's what he says you guys are able to

go down to dinner have dinner it's a

it's a it's a expensive but really rich

meal and it's still hotel food even

though it's a really nice place so

you're kind of overpaying but they do

have

uh you know a notorious chef and there

was you guys get a lot of looks but

nobody nobody like gives you any

attitude hmm

you guys stand out but you are you're

you're doing the work for it you earned

that yeah you got the you got the

clothes and like I said you're not the

first kind of military guys that stay

here right the day is gonna pass

uneventful okay you guys are able to go

spend the night here

guests of the Pharaohs dream I come let

me go back this stables asleep okay is

that is it Locker thank you snow it's

open 24 hours a day I take off go good

thing off my fancy clothes so don't get

too stinking okay so you go are you

staying with boots

no what they can't yours they know I

mean but like where are you gonna when

you say okay sorry change clothes yeah I

don't sleep in my clothes yeah put in my

own my old one are they just stored in

the stables is that what that's not

asking like oh my god are you keeping

your stuff um as you probably keep it

with someone so doesn't well they'll

have to come and get me you have your

dad's keycard to the room obviously yeah

[Laughter]

you guys do the keys okay yeah you'll

have a key you happy okay yeah okay then

I'll store it and that in keys are on

also they're like souvenirs don't keep

it in on stinky wrong so they change the

locks

yeah they have they have they have

people on staff that make special keys

really quickly there's sandstone slim is

gonna take advantage of every amenity

available to him and so he's really

because like a lot of these noblemen are

used to being waited on literally hand

and foot like and like being naked

around their servants and that's kind of

servant sir like sure yeah like you

wanna take a bath that's fine they'll

dry you off and stuff like that

it's it's up to you what slim is used to

or what he's willing to how far like go

give it a go okay yeah well I mean then

then it you are you are severely

pampered here right like like this is

probably like how the Olympics this is

how the illicits lived like the had

slaves like you like on the map that you

guys have of the somnium to Neverest

there were the slave quarters right that

are just just for the slaves of the

commanders of the Olympics so this is

kind of that yeah but except this guy I

mean he's getting paid you assume yes

well I'll ask him oh yeah certainly yes

of course yeah I know I've I'm lucky to

have a job sir yeah yeah my parents said

it was a my parents it would be foolish

for me to apply here but you know yeah I

don't imagine slim would tolerate

slavery no I imagine he would

considering he was one right for a while

yeah he does multiple times yeah no he

no yeah he's been yeah and he's yeah

he's surprised you asked he surprised

you took the time to ask um is it for

the next day

it can be yes absolutely well I'm just I

just want to know what it is because I

gotta go meet angel at the Apple

merchant oh that's right you get slipped

under your doors you get a folded piece

of you all each can they fold a piece of

paper it's large room service

no it's a broadsheet oh so we got our

eight hours or so I want to read it read

what to stay in there black cotton

sacked that says across the top

oh geez trade with bad Gloria cutoff it

has none if you read the articles

they're much longer than this I'm just

gonna give you the headlines in their

thesis business skimming trade with Vaz

Lauria cutoff it is unknown how the cry

solace was able to get from tomorrow to

Western man's Lauria artifacts gathered

from the cities Ajax has plundered may

be fueling his incredible power hmm

there's another smaller headline that

says chained boughs to stop a jacks

[Laughter]

yes nearly annihilated after a poorly

planned assassination attempt the

remains of a once-great mercenary

company have washed up on the docks of

capital nation about an assassination

attempt the commanding officer of the

chain of Acheron proclaimed and then in

quotes it says we took a contract to

eliminate Ajax's wizard but we were

betrayed we intend to find allies here

and finish the contract end quote

the senior officers intend on using the

Pharaoh's dream as their headquarters

the origins and backgrounds of the

senior officers are shrouded in mystery

King appears to be a pikarin descent

some say he is an exile forced

anna-marie service after have failed

attempt to overthrow the immortal

Empress the company's ship is an

elliptic mind raider piloted by an

enigmatic alien who may have

mind-control powers there's another

headline that's there at this point

after this one you get into like local

stories about trade and and politics but

this one says city officials divided on

AJAX when asked for comment on recent

events counts count Gianna Alvaro said

we face a serious threat this

self-styled iron Saint means to bring

the entire world

under his boot including capital we

should be offering the immortal empress

aid but instead we bicker when all else

is lost in the end capital will fall

just like the rest

end quote lady Faust to Manetti

president of the Imperial Bank speaking

on behalf of the fulcrum was more

practical quote everyone agrees the city

badly needs leadership the only question

is who and when what was that name says

lady Fausto Minetti president of the

Imperial Bank speaking on behalf of the

fulcrum Ajax seeks to make the answer

simple personally I was never a great

fan of the prince and have little

interest in who rules

end quote after a thoughtful PAH it says

here after a thoughtful pause she added

quote the city was founded by an emperor

and there are more details in each of

these stories they talk about all of you

folks in the thing about the chain and

they talk about how like there were

rumors that the chain is a mercenary

company from hell

they say about me they

they talk about the the ryokan senior

officer who appears to be they accuse

you being a spy a spot yep yep a spy for

they don't know the papers don't know

their life is being a just general spot

yeah probably yeah the apparently acting

as the chains intelligence officers you

know mm-hmm they make up there's their

stuff in here

there's there's reference to copper

those reference to judge in here it's a

bit the reference to copper is like the

the the chain er it describes how you

guys are not a normal or scenario

company and how there are creatures from

you know they're there all manner of

creatures including goblins and and even

T flings like they make the story makes

a big deal about how there's at a

fleeing senior officer and there's some

there's obviously like coded like the

people riding this and the people

reading this obviously have an opinion

about tailings right but it's not

expressed here it's just assumed right

all right are you sure it didn't say

that there's goblins and even demons no

it does it does say noted for consorting

with demons it does say that it does

yeah so that's it's just like that's the

morning paper you give me the morning

paper is there anything else on here

there also no it doesn't say monocle I

have a lot of questions for the

concierge okay do you want her gonna go

down and ask no I think whoa what's the

plan I really get breakfast first and

then go meet up at the apple cart with

angel or are you just doing that if you

guys want go yeah mm-hmm I'm gonna

follow up with him see what he found out

but I think we want to talk to Alvaro

yeah that's what my questions for the

concierge yeah yes I have plenty of

stories to tell him Neru you want

telling more stories well yeah he tells

her he's he's a teller of today you know

you need he said you had mind-control

powers oh you do I'm sorry you wish to

contact the house of Allah yes and in in

in the body of whom like like like who

who specifically would you wish to speak

to Gianna Alvaro Johnny Oliver so that

guys I don't know how this guy wouldn't

press that but he's a he's he's a like

he's a miner

noble who works for the city government

and it's probably not going to be

available to the public like getting an

audience that guy was probably take a

little one

he doesn't talk like with his

constituents on a regular basis what's a

constituent it's like this is a few

tiles like these are yeah these are no

no he said he's um he's armed he's a

minor official in the in the Alvaro in

how solve are but if sir wishes a if sir

wishes an audience with him we can send

a runner and see it bills bills just by

taking a little while it's probably not

used to getting requests from the

commander the chain

[Music]

it was just in the moment I should make

a note anything let's make a note of it

was in the I just make another crazy

[ __ ] you people are asking to do it was

in the the papers with miles on three

pairs of sodas and they're all

disappearing listen I put this job as

danger can you sit for long

so you guys want an audience with the

dude from the paper this is the kind of

downtime thing where you guys let me

know what you want to do and the

concierge will go figure out we'll go

figure out how to do it and get back to

you information on a fulcrum what does

Sir wish to know how a fulcrum is a

powerful yield what's the purpose in the

full growth are the in sales guild they

are are they are our local patron

audience an audience what someone in the

fulcrum will be will be much easier to

grant what kind of I'm sorry what kind

of guild was it a BSA here is good a

sayers Gilda okay

there's mount times of the bank you said

or the lady is I'm sorry what the lady

in the newspaper yes yes she's uh she's

Jesus she she's the president of the

Abril Bank yeah the fulcrum run on

superbe

where's paper it's it's over it's done

I've been scenario were talking about

this one belongs to me paper his place

with like all the different references

yes lady files to marry president bill

that get what half

the only reason you want is because

Annalise no I want a copycat yeah yeah

yeah so that's so like you're in their

territory

like you're you're you're soaking in it

this is the the fulcrum runs the fulcrum

runs the states okay interesting like so

you've already met an agent of the sir

may have already seen the officers of

the fulcrum once with L pins L opens no

that's the that's house no VAR I think

no they wear a blue vest so with tool

buttons the police huh yes the cops the

cops are those are those are the

fulcrums police they work for the guilt

the guilt owns them I see so the other

officers that are walking around

breastplates yeah oh those so yeah yeah

this is well within the students we lost

this is really normal stuff that's a

house alvaro and that's different from

house in Navarre right correct

yeah house alvaro is the Navy oh how

come they are they're the ones that also

have the rapists yeah okay Alec rest

you're talking about is another house

that's probably and in fact the

concierge knows who we're talking about

now you're probably you probably saw

that on somebody in customs customs

customs the customs is kind of a weird

scenario it's run man it's run by a

guild Anna Anna watts oh interesting

it's a hybrid yeah then then nobody's

like it's there's a long tradition there

and it's nobody likes it but that's just

Wayne is okay yeah so if sir wishes an

audience to the president in the

Imperial Bank that's gonna take a while

and you saw would have to have good

business I can't just I can't just send

a messenger to the okay well in that

case is very easy to me to help you

people don't people don't talk to her

all the time is there a this paper that

we were that were delivered to us I

brought you yeah do they have an office

here at state

okay do you know where that's located at

yep and you know who runs that office

yep in fact uh the senior editor the the

senior editor editor stays her often Oh

what is their name he tells you are you

familiar with the balance spring so are

you familiar with the balance spring

watchmaker no interesting I'm afraid

this is uh this is a piece of jargon and

I'm not familiar with is this something

to do with mechanisms I think that they

are a group of some kind whether they be

a I probably a guild perhaps smaller

well unfortunately sir this is a

reputable hotel and so if there are any

kind of organizations that do not have

legitimate business of course I would

not know yeah it sounds like them um do

you are you familiar with the order of

the rubric sir yes I do they also get

sponsored by their sponsor by the broad

should kill neither the knights of the

broadsheet guild

got it do you know if they also have an

office location here in the states or a

guild house their guild house is not

here there there some of their officers

are here so our officers yeah some of

them are some of the some of those some

of the Knights of the somewhere you can

always find Knights of the broadsheet

guild somewhere in the in the states

because they're always reporting on

who's showing up in capital you may have

encountered some of yourself your your

arrival here would almost certainly have

been noticed by a by a knight of the

rubric mm-hmm I haven't read the

morning's paper so I'm afraid I'm not up

on current events so the local police

the ones with the buttons right also

part patrons our patron by the assayer's

guild

yeah the fulcrum right who's the is

there like a single police captain in

the area there are I mean there's a

several different stations throughout

the throughout the stays and they each

have their own

of local hierarchy and then there's a

kind of like a police station central

police station that they all report to

but they're mostly independent each

one's mostly independent this is this is

an island that's about as big as

Manhattan okay so you're talking about

like some of these places on five six

miles away from each other did sir have

business with the uh I was just curious

who it was like how it was set up

essentially are these please also

located within the walls of Capitol like

proper we're we're speaking of the

different design the gold buttons yes no

sir okay so each district in Capitol has

probably its own police force of some

kind sir yes sir each each noble house

including the Guild's runs its own parts

of the city I see and there's no

overarching military force of some kind

that brutality our city that would be

the the princes troops are currently are

technically leaderless but that would

probably be how solve our Oh in the most

part the Marines the breastplate guys

are going to see all over the place

got it so house I'll borrow that was

princess that was is Alvaro is that the

name of the Prince no oh it's just

something else that's the Navy no that's

that okay what happened to the prince we

heard that oh he is murdered

Oh years ago Oh interesting

still still leaderless yes I cannot of

course I cannot comment on politics it's

something I don't pay attention to they

say he was ordered who says they it was

in the papers a broadsheet it was in the

papers hey it must be true oh actually

is there a stable near riot that you can

be able to purchase a force from Oh what

to buy ORS not only you'll have to go to

like the edge you have to no not in the

stays because we're an island and we

don't really use

Oh in the city proper yeah but it's it's

you're probably gonna have to go to like

the gates of the city like the part of

the city that faces the rest of Rihanna

hold a rare that somebody like deep in

the city is going to need to buy ours

maybe when you buy horse because you

want to go somewhere somewhere somewhere

outside capital I heard that in order to

carry weapons within the city that you

have to have a knighthood is that

correct well sir yes Knights Knights are

permitted to cast spell that Knights are

permitted sorcery and and steel Oh Steve

okay got it

how does one go about getting a

knighthood it's not uncommon it's

typically money must change hand or

favours sure is is there any patron that

you would suggest well sir would be I I

would not I would never dream of of

making such such a suggestion at once I

mean you're you're kind of saying which

is better Democrats or Republicans stars

in the two dollar sign or below there's

what it's like it's they're not like for

sale

there are a result of either graft

mm-hmm meaning you've got to kind of

bribe somebody and this guy is kind of

like I don't deal with that sorry so

what you're saying is there's not just

one night that there's like multiple

different time sir there are dozens of

knighthoods there are dozens of nightly

orders in the city there's not one

that's more reputable than the others

all the noble houses I am assured that

the Knights sponsored by each noble

house is perfectly reputable just trying

to be nice mm-hmm and would never would

never think to and he can't say anything

bad about yeah anyone else it's a real

like yeah he likes yeah where does the

fighting take place so there is a

gladiator arena unfortunately it's it's

it's bit long and disrepair but there

are in the city proper there are

recently imported style from Baz Lauria

of pugilism yeah I hear it's very

popular

I've heard the lower classes but

typically the fighting the fighting in

Rio has done on the stage and is

theatrical in nature sir perhaps it to

the death only if the reviews are very

bad yeah yeah you like the address

perhaps sir would like a ticket to a

show he'll arrange to get you uh he'll

arrange to give you tickets to a local

show in this days that he will assure

you has a lot of of action and violence

yeah oh yes quite a lot of violence yes

a veritable bloodbath I'm assured actual

death as slim as Slim ever experienced

like I think probably you know some sort

well I mean yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna

Majan they you could be like the guys

from Galaxy Quest like oh those poor

people I would imagine they would know

you know I don't know I mean it for gift

Yankee war is the ultimate expression of

yeah you know so it would probably be

gladiatorial type of things and it

sounds like you guys probably have like

scalds rather than like like it sound

like slim seems interested in people

telling a story yeah right so that's but

that's probably sounds more like Beowulf

style stuff as opposed to like actors

and parts and dialogue and as children

low then did slim grasp of the blade

well I think I think that if it was if

it was a cool story of valour and more

fair and and topics airing of whatever I

think he would probably be interested

there's a there's a brand new play

called the golden bull it was getting

great reviews and as

as a as a as a newly cast recapitulation

of a famous battle between Rioja and

Phaedra's cool another question are

there any other mercenary companies in

the city that you're aware of or woman's

the last time you know there are there

are there are nights for sale for the

proper coin yes

that's like an actual organization or

freelance there are a couple of kind of

nightly orders I don't know how he would

express this there are a couple of

nightly orders the cooze patron has been

killed and so now they're kind of like

Ronin and you can just hire them hmm

who's their patron I'm there's dozens of

oh you're talking about you're talking

about a city that has literally

thousands of noblemen in it right and

spread out among dozens of noble houses

some very large some very tiny and you

know so there's but it takes you a while

talking to this guy to understand that

when you ask hey are there mercenary

companies here he's like yeah I was sure

absolutely he means like you like like

you six right not like a unit all right

like there's no there's nothing in

there's no mercenary unit in cattle

there are sell swords there but there is

not mercenary companies there's a crack

there's not are they're not freelance

armies right there are mercenary bands

right that might number as many as 12

like that kind of thing right and we

should hire them all I was gonna say we

should at least reach out to to these

groups of we can patch him over there

already well he can he can hope he'll

he'll sir is asking questions a little

bit outside my remit but I'm resourceful

here in the Pharaohs room and we intend

to supply only the best of resources to

our clientele if you give me a a day or

two I'm sure we can get you the names of

some local eager freelance Knights it

there's probably some REO in term that

is kind of romantic the way Ronin hits

to us right right but literally just

means out-of-work night yeah while you

are talking like while you're

monopolizing the the the concierge is

time there are other people checking out

and being a checking and checking out

being helped by other employees but this

kind of squat middle-aged man wearing of

Abbott's ossible approaches and asks one

of the people behind the counter if the

chain of a chronic sting looks over at

the concierge and the concierge is like

as you see and the abbot kind of puts

everything together and says my work

like like holy crap you're standing

framing and he's he scurries he's got

he's wearing like a long shapeless robe

and you curries up to you and and is

somewhat taken aback whatever mental

picture he had of the chain of macron

this doesn't fit it and he is kind of

torn between you two and his like and

and who's who speaks for the chain come

same I serve the church of Saint Hilario

a little boutique hole-in-the-wall

places there's about a dozen places to

sit inside and there's a it's like I've

almost like a cafe and that there's

places to sit outside and there's a lot

of foot traffic going by and everybody

nice part down here in them you're in

the nice part of this district and he he

is eager to ask a favor of you I read

the morning paper while they're talking

like the the

a number of people were like what the

[ __ ] is she like when they see you like

seen a lot they're used to seeing things

like drow but things from other things

weather planes are pretty rare I don't

think it phases him fair enough

surprised by they talk they everybody

having officers III apologize I've never

have never hired anybody anybody like

like you folks but before so if I if I

if I you said there were you said the

the broadsheet the guild abroad the

guild you said the bride she was a

inaccurate III I was under I was

interested that you were looking for

we are looking forward oh oh thank

goodness

well what's up she was perhaps too

accurate did you read it changed over

the immortal Empress that's ridiculous

anyways well III I'm not I'm not I'm not

interested in your in your personal

history what's there there's a trifle

there's a symbol of the church's

blessing on the lawgivers of this island

this local is that this law is it this

island yeah stand by let me read my own

notes mmm to the lawgivers yeah the

people who run like cops

people who get lost would that be like

police or like politician I think it'd

be politicians like that what the hell

was that

what the hell did I mean when I wrote

this protium are you not entertained

okay it's a

there's an artifact and and he is not

using the term in Dungeons and Dragons

sense there's an artifact that was made

by our church and that we gave to the

princes servants when they administer

this island and it's been lost and as a

gesture of our faith in and belief in

ladies shoroma we would like to as a

gesture give this artifact to her

unfortunately it would be considered a

sign of good faith and and and a

blessing on on her and her guild and the

hopes that that we have peace on the

island but unfortunately it's in the

Citadel whose lady is shoroma and

where's the lady a lady lady sure lady

sure Romania runs the poker he wants to

give it to her

yeah yes yeah okay basta Manetti is not

the leader of the poker ladies lady man

it is the lady Minnie works for the

filler come yes a very formidable woman

lady yeah but she does not she does not

run the fulcrum now what's her name

again

Yomi that's a hit Garen name by the way

what is the Citadel Oh the city don't

like you guys may have seen it you can

see it if you could stand on the ceiling

of the Pharaohs dream like stand on the

roof of it rather you'd be able to see

it it's a it's a fortress it's like an

old medieval I mean yeah it's an old

medieval fortress that was once occupied

by the princes soldiers but it's been

abandoned for hundreds of years is it on

this same wind yes it's on it's on it's

on this island yeah it used to be it

used to be just a you know back before I

was abandoned yeah it's been a banner

for a while people people if they say

it's haunted it's not hot he's like sure

you I speak as authority on and why not

go get it yourself well I'm not

I'm not a soldier I'm not I don't know

how to so there are things there what

there are things there but we'll need

slaying pirates probably something

something occupies something occupies

the place and is allowed I don't know

why I'm not an expert on these things

I'm I am but a lowly Abbot but there's

some business being done inside the

Citadel that the full concerns of blind

eye to in faith the the the fulcrum is

well you're not there in faith I am

there you're outside I no no I said I

stand behind these girls I thought you

were I thought you were like I'm gonna

be on the hook I don't know why no no no

no sorry um so show me the last name

yeah is that name familiar Oh desert

knowledge history not there's no mystery

anymore but there's history makin makin

history check it say you recognize oh no

no if she's anybody it's nobody you

heard her she could just be you know a

random a random exile from takara why do

you want to impress lady Fermi well I

mean it's a yeah and she runs she runs

the island and we were our churches here

on the island and and you know in times

past our church had great authority with

the local governors and unfortunately

that that time has passed and our our

Authority is leaned and if there was a

way for us to sort of let it be known

that in the coming conflict that that we

support lady sure Oh me then I think

things would go well for her and go well

for us with the coming conflict yes well

the in though

for leadership of the city this jade

sign looks like our things sort of

coming to a head in that regard I mean

it cannot last as it is forever I mean

the prince is dead he says why do you

want us in more several years right yeah

but no like so now like now that Ajax is

threatened the like he's not an expert

on yeah yeah it's just everybody knows

yeah it's kind of its kind of like the

like before but been in both World War

one and World War two people knew there

was gonna be a war for years pressure

anything yeah and so he's just like one

of the guys it's like everybody

everybody knows there's gonna be a

there's gonna be a fight right and so we

can we think that it would be that it

would be that it would be a sign of the

Church of st. polari oh the aspirants

belief and support the full faith and

support of the church in lady sure Oh me

why do you want to support the Volcom I

mean well she's she's our local governor

but you realize that if Ajax were to

come she would support Ajax based on the

paper said you read that's I don't I

don't know that okay well you realize

Ajax does not let you follow your God I

mean this is I'm I'm but I'm a lowly at

it I don't I don't I don't run the

church I don't make decisions regarding

you don't care about God and Saint

Ilario will provide why are we talking

about Ajax because Ajax is coming well I

mean I mean yes certainly yes certainly

as ajax ajax is coming yes yes we all

agree yes but now right now it's all

right we were interested in it

regardless I understand if you're

reluctant to take on a particular child

this is probably it's probably quite

beneath you

I was probably wrong with me to ask what

uh what is the artifact it's a it's a

rod about yay long it's inscribed with

kind of like us it's like a freeze of

the deeds of st. Pilar you can you could

easily make like a little like triptych

as it goes around can you get us a

license to use magic a license to use

magic yeah a license to use magic for if

we're gonna be fighting pirates and

things that are in this place

well there's actually no that I mean

there were no police in the Citadel I

mean what you do what are you doing

there will be no one will know that's

what about them don't know correct no

like the Citadel is abandoned it's an

abandoned ruin okay that kind of sits in

the city and used it once before there

were five story tall buildings on the

city hundreds of years ago it was kind

of a dominant structure but that was

that was generations will do it did you

discuss payment he well no how much how

much I'm authorized to I'm authorized to

pay about how much how much how much do

you cost King Spurs for you Matt what's

the equivalent of one dice on me it's

like a couple of thousand little pieces

that well it depends on actually I think

it's a little I think it's like

logarithmic I think like going like

things that cost six don't cost six

times more than things that cost one

they cause like 30 times so each each

level each level is a lot more so right

now you're the treasurer dies at for

getting it from four to five might cost

like I don't know twenty thousand gold

so it's like first edition experience

it's like getting from like getting from

fifth to 6 or 6 to 7 level was like

you're like that's [ __ ]

[Music]

I mean maybe your characters would know

a good about a payment be that's fair I

don't know that's totally fair I mean

it's I would say for like like he's he's

names neighborhoods yeah

yeah we're not gonna get knighthoods

from this guy I don't think

are you it is sir sorry sir I mean are

you in need of of knighthoods it would

be useful yes I can tell you that the

the church the church does not have does

not squared we're relatively small

church and do not sponsor an order of

knights but I know people who do they

put in a good word for you

there we go I think this is as an aside

if you would pardon me for a moment

oh by all means I understand discuss I'm

Stephanie were you have business to

commander he'll he'll be happy to just

he just breakfast it's delicious I'm for

it I mean we fetch the stutes rod I mean

I mean there's no reason not to do it

but I have some hesitation with the how

is this gonna because if there is like I

mean you do have the paper right house

is gonna which part of the paper exactly

how's the part of the paper about the

discussion between or uh the decree by

Alvaro and fulcrum the fulcrum seems

fine with Ajax coming obviously they

don't know that Ruby's gonna die if Ajax

comes and Ajax didn't put somebody else

in power like any as far as we got

people are concerned Ajax is coming is

years away

oh this isn't something that's gonna

happen like it's like global expect from

these people is just global warming it's

like that's nice I'm sure it's gonna

happen but who knows and when will that

even happen in our lifetimes I know I

see this is like we're like this is just

like a local church wait I mean it said

it just a easy job right it's an easy

job like we're not we aren't directly

supporting Ajax like I feel like this is

pretty far removed from budget if you

need if you need time to think about it

we could I could go back tomorrow I just

wonder how this is gonna help build our

army we there's just a bunch of church

dudes or thing it's not make money money

needed we gotta pay the troops do they

have money though no well good job we're

getting out copper there's only one

quick quick and quick a payment in

networking I know

were denied it exactly they're so weak

take care of some pirates like we we

fought 11 pirates yeah a week ago you

know like what's what could possibly not

the Citadel the way yeah look you

possibly worse than you know my pleasure

ship in exploding man God the third dead

we can deal with those easy stuff I'm a

port commander I agree

I was easy Wow oh yeah discuss the price

yes I'm pretty good I mean yeah he he is

willing like it's gonna cost a one bill

to fill giant soap please you guys are

six level he's hiring five six level

officers it's gonna be like by a

thousand gold is what he's willing to

offer

I need makes it clear this is a

substantial outlay for the church or a

small church that'll keep us shored up

at the Pharaoh's dream for at least

until our duds are ready haha if you

laugh like that no all right I'm six

slim on him

let's go six no I mean he's he's

astonished that you guys are able to

make it make up your minds that quickly

everyone oh look for I mean this is the

first dude that came to us there's quick

job fix a couple hours let's take that

quick how far away is the UH wasn't

there a church you go to the clerics I

can heal if you get beat up

what do you think I'm I'm texting a

friend of my [ __ ] off so it's rude for

for an abbot to sit there and speaking

stone let's meet again tomorrow morning

in Wolong Oh an answer so certainly

certainly not the angel first he's

Gray's away he's wants to leave you to

eat so he can go see he's paying for

this all right yeah he's already he's

already paid

he seems really like Elodie like he's

not used to handling large amounts of

currency and even just paying for you

guys eating here it's like it's not the

money on him yep no he isn't at five

thousand gold on he has enough to pay

for her for breakfast that are really

really snooty place there is no there

are no audio engineers too late now that

kids came out its cannon there should be

a snooty Fox somewhere in the city yeah

oh make sure that we will find it anyway

so you've got sure that yeah your

breakfast is otherwise uneventful the

abbot scurries off he seems hugely

relieved like he was I like dealing with

you folks with really that's actually

the worst breakfast I've probably ever

had I agree

that's pretty good what have you done

fill the role to find out what they

think well it's the first time so legs

okay baby birds no chickens and answers

they feel bad but you actually pay for

that what that was pretty anyway eat

garbage places that it's it's actually

not very palatable but it's in fashion

and therefore an acquired taste and so

it's like why would you put

that was your to leaf salad sir it's not

anyway anyway it is like that but no no

enough in jokes the hell are we talking

about oh yeah so at this point breakfast

is done uh-huh you guys are free to do

what you want oh it's still a little

early it's not even lying I am you we

need to go get some what the hell you've

got a [ __ ] scroll is that all my

questions okay I was really like wow

okay you could get like a book thing

like you can have one that's a word okay

I hardly knew her when you're all done

you guys gonna go what time we're gonna

meet angel er 1:30 well yeah but you're

still no I'm not I'm sorry refresh my

memory what is it you're trying to find

out from angel no we just wanted to you

know put his ear to the ground and the

shadows in the shadows people looking

for work etc okay okay yeah all right

sure yeah you guys go back to the apple

cart and the apple cart cellar is like

my friends your favorite card yeah takes

out on the stairs yes he's like I just

stocked up on more sausages just for you

brand-new fresh straight off the pig or

whatever one percent authentic meat but

some I just had breakfast but I'll take

one I ended up scooting like some of

that off my plate so I'm actually still

pretty hungry so he starts making all of

you

one caramel dipped sauce caramel sauce

like this is this is my life now all

right here we go and he just assumes you

all want to eat them and as you are

knocking on your

[Laughter]

smile on space where the other two are

you there are you not there where do you

want to be I had questions for the guy

you had questions for the concierge so

meanwhile as you guys are talking to the

Abbott judge has questions for the

concierge yes yes

so I said you more questions as they

walked off so I had heard that the

broadsheets is run by a woman and a some

kind of Dragonborn is that correct yes

do you know the name of the woman who

runs the broadsheets

he does okay cool and he doesn't ask the

same thing about the Dragonborn and then

also judges I comment on the fact that

like it's interesting most places I've

been to Dragon Warren have had to be

very concealed is that not the case here

in capital that's actually probably not

the case for you

oh is it not no it's only in Vaz Lauria

are like like so like in my past lives

yeah I'm not sure how much how much

service judge has done in Baz lorry but

only in that kind of Western European

analogue like there so it like mmm

Dragonborn are made yes and there are

people probably in every region of Orden

there's someone who could make them so

being Dragonborn does not mean you're oh

thank god that yeah being Dragonborn

yeah i mean every region has 18th to

20th level wizards in it they're just

plugging our they thought it was totally

just like just uh the wizard from before

like there's like two main wizards who

just made a dragon boilie so I mean

you're weird so it's it's as though so

what you're reciting is you're reciting

this kind of bog Marion legend

from from Germany but you're in the

middle of Colombia okay right and it's

like well we also have people here but

we don't have those people right so it's

it's in that in that tiny part of the

world

Dragonborn are were created by vitae but

there are there are there are people in

every region of the world that know the

ritual interesting and there were rumors

that Dragonborn can be spontaneously

created as a result of proximity to

powerful dragons that you cannot you

don't you don't know if that's true or

not that sounds pretty

you can't know if it's true not because

I don't know if it's true or not

something anyway why what were you

asking about the Dragonborn it is

unusual to have a dragon born I've seen

your editor as a dragon right well we

just you know we have some of our own

amongst our ranks and just want to be

assured of their safety when they are in

capital few or the ancestry is that

experience open discrimination here in

the city as I'm sure you well no no I

don't want to you know well then neither

do i he says all right so very

egalitarian seduces all right so one

point we talked about host Alvaro who

yes Laura who is private Navy and some

like that and they're also I think my

understanding from talking with no good

esto is that Prospero Alvaro supposed to

be kind of this frontrunner up to take

the place of the prince yeah I think I

screwed up some of the names of the

houses that sorry house Verona is the

Navy house Barone is the Navy okay world

building what do I know make all the

stuff you make all this stuff up

yeah house Verona is the Navy house I'll

borrow is I believe the church this is

why this is what happens when I don't

have my iPad on me okay so look on it

like Nix is my question but I did want

to ask with the if he's familiar with

marquee damasco the Admiral yeah the

Admiral estate here on more than my case

we have been honored to host the Admiral

when he needs to

usually when he's having some important

meeting with a foreign visiting

dignitary interesting so he comes here

often

I wouldn't say often perhaps once a year

Oh once a year that's not very often at

all because it talks enough to make note

of it though well I mean he's he's he's

not he's not the head of that faction

but he's a person minute got it okay

okay

I have my notes of I'm sorry no sure

alright cuz I'm just gonna I'm just

gonna ask what Prospero cuz I thought

Alvaro was Verona but since that's not

the case anymore we can go ahead and

forget all that and then I'm gonna show

him my crew drawing of the the spring I

know we had discussed it before he said

he wasn't familiar with it after I show

him that does that ring a bell

have you seen this symbol anywhere I'm

sure I have it alright thank you very

time so I can give you I can give you ha

I will I will give you folks the rundown

of the information you're able to glean

from these people regarding the high

level politics of the city because you

certainly talk to enough people at this

point mm-hmm it's basically you still

need that from Modesto I could have to

swear he's gonna get it to you you know

he got waylaid by a pub last night

and unfortunately is [ __ ] putting four

hours I'm just sayin well he'd like

relying on a ryeowon first mate of a

pirate ship is probably not the most oh

I know we just walked close but I

probably know that um you know as you

can see we're not as finely dressed as

some of the folks around here I think

sir is very well dressed please don't

patronize me we would like to I would

like to acquire some finer clothing oh

we went to ABCs is there any place one

of the finest in the one of the finest

in the States

oh is it and there's none borough much

there

finer in the city okay I would like the

name of the finest he gives it to you

want you want this do I understand sir

correctly that you wish to know the name

and location of the best tailor

witnesses that he knew he knew exactly

how I was gonna punctuate what I was

gonna say before I it said it which

means I'm obviously too I'm too obvious

I prefer the term reliable okay I'm sure

you do

that was also predictable reliable

gorgeous I'm making notes I'm making

notes of the stuff that you guys want me

to go do research on come back okay

so angel meanwhile meanwhile at the

apple cart yeah and and people are

coming like there's a apparently dressed

for work and on her break ryokan woman

who in her early 40s who watches this

and asks to also have a caramel covered

special he says he calls like Peaks yes

a clerical chain-link police i yes yep

Apple seller is like this is crazy

saying he starts calling out sausage you

just a picture and you walk in it's it's

small and it's cold in here and it's

dark it's so at this point it's probably

not like 10:30 I guess 10:30 11 o'clock

it's a little bit before it's a little

more noon and it's a small pattern and

it's [ __ ] it's not super clean and

there are not that many people in here

there's like one or two early customers

there are rooms upstairs and there's a

gentleman and what appears to be like

like a a kind of the ryeowon version of

like middle management outfit not really

well-dressed but just put together not

showing off how much money he has spent

on his outfit but it is you know right

it's respectable yeah and and angels

life after you boss and it kind of

points to the table and at first from

when you walk in specially as your eyes

are adjusting he just looks like a fit

kind of guy with short hair and as you

approach he's dead like this is a

revenant this is sallow gray skin and

there's like flies like look land on the

ground

it's musty there is a there's definitely

a smell as your approach and actually

it's like well no I mean what lowercase

R I mean maybe I don't know I haven't

looked up the 5e stats on a revenant

right but these key is no and no stories

- he's yeah and like there's like a fly

will just like kind of go away

he doesn't that flies buzzing around him

but he's he's either dead or berry very

unwell and yeah is this gray dark gray

skin smells like home smells with it it

is a it's the smell of like an old tomb

that has lay undisturbed for centuries

and this is the shadow yep

okay why do you say like that I'm just

clarifying yeah you guys are in the

Prince of shadow is what it's called

well he wanted to talk with us the chain

of Acheron I presume have a seat yeah

yeah the tables are cheaply put together

like they like they're not they wobble

they were they were they wobble the the

chairs creak when you sit in them I read

the broad sheet this morning I represent

a very old family something was stolen

from them centuries ago it cost like a

moth go flies out of it

his teeth are yellowing they're really

well like really won't put together

teeth like when his guys live

spent a lot of my ass teeth but that was

a while ago and now things are starting

to kind of goes out what's the family a

local family obviously

named I was hoping that I was dealing

with men of discretion because I

certainly am one thing's confident can

you can you keep a secret

mm-hmm well so can I now this item we

seek to recover belongs legally to the

family I represent you understand it is

their property who has it

that's a good question stand by yeah you

ask a complex question I do not know who

has it I only know where it is and it

has been long beyond our reach there was

an item in the paper I read this morning

that leads me to believe that you I'd be

able to recover it we might be able to

where is this item it is on an island

surrounded by a lake a lake in another

world

mm-hmm well that's a that's an

interesting detail what other world

astral plane somewhat farther below in

hell no no too far the sunless sea in

the world below lost to us for centuries

but your pilot captain's a ship that can

get there we have no facility to recover

ourselves but the aging matriarch of the

family I represent has begged us to

recover it though we have politely

declined until now I was hoping you

might be able to aid us what's the

time line that you need this

as soon as is practicable so somebody

currently own somebody currently has

possession of this item in the world

below it has been lost for generations

you guys at well I mean you as players

I've met beholder it lives down there oh

they'll be bad news if it were yeah

almost certainly not who knows

yeah he doesn't here's nowhere he only

knows where it is what is the item uh a

crowd a crowd the crowd yeah you can't

you'll recognize it as soon as you see a

crayon crayon he describes it to you

it's a real it's a it's a crown in the

ryeowon style whatever that means

interesting fancy yeah I'm empowered to

make any offer necessary are you I'm

sure others have approached you with

with work yes we will outbid them is

this an exclusive deal in essence that

if we take this job we can't take any

others I don't think we're gonna be able

to find very many jobs that also want us

to go into the underdog we have a other

business to conclude in the city so we

would not be able to leave immediately

if our relationship proves rewarding and

fruitful and mutually beneficial then we

may be interested in hiring you on

retainer

in which case we would be very

particular about who you associated with

but for now we are happy to employ you

as free agents hey maybe they can get us

knighthoods we most assuredly cattle you

know I'm liking the sound of this should

we the wrong well how do you feel about

the fulcrum mmm mmm run by a woman I

think but what's your I think that says

it all don't you know oh boy we'll come

on evil that's we are all gentlemen we

were all gentle in here I can assure you

that the family I represent are very

traditional aren't you also run by an

old maid sure uh the temporary

embarrassment on her part meaning

meaning that she doesn't want to be in

charge well no of course not

politics is no place for a woman

damn No are you familiar with happened

with what happened in black bottom

bottom in a backwater town on the other

side of the world I think there may have

been something in the paper this morning

about it I treasure my ignorance hmm

yeah you're a rich man then I've been

insulted by better but not wearing boots

like that lots of money chance to kill

mine Flair's night ok everyone into

yellow dark an undead army undead army

[Music]

so in the sunless sea and the world

below we can always think on it for a

day

well yeah but I think character but can

we actually get there with it

right yeah cuz the the my players that I

mean they're the Underdark is another

plane that's world yes we just use a

maelstrom again I think probably get to

it right no that's still the Navigator

where you want to go yeah you might have

to you might you might have to get a

chart like you might have to the the

fantastic who have no like you need

coordinates right cuz you can't just

tell the navigator hey we want to go to

another universe right expect to end up

we're in that University or expect to be

does he have the slim we'll ask him do

you have the coordinates for this place

um yeah I don't know if he'd use it

weren't that's know if I wouldn't say

coordinates but he would say we're gonna

you you you know that you're gonna need

a chart right you have a chart from this

place so he doesn't know how your ship

works but he he says what anything

anything you require let me know in

detail and I provide it there we have we

employ many sages day well yeah we're uh

we're establishing ourselves in the city

reaches into his coat and pulls up a

card and he says

my car contact me when you have an

answer very well the card is completely

blank how do you hold it and it's not

magic you just tell you just tell a tell

give this to the concierge at the

Pharaoh's dream what's a card look like

it's it's a I think it's blank

what color is I mean what it's a white

it's like a bone white card with

literally either that it's like you get

it wet yeah let her show up or something

like that pee on it

very specific very specific ritual I

[Laughter]

hope we can do business the people I

represent will be very disappointed if

they're rejected we'll go back to you

than the weave week within the week

you look as watches i watch you've

waited this long for you can wait week

unless my benefactor in prefers to get

bad news as quickly as possible

can you send to the wall they said a

sage you said the equivalent of

coordinates like they can they can tell

us how far we need a chart if you need

to like an a like a like a navigational

chart right that says here's how it let

here's that it here's how to get a boat

from point A to point B and they said

they're gonna supplies yeah okay yep

look at you one of those can you supply

it doesn't really know what you're

talking about yeah he's like I assume

that if I repeat the gobbledygook you're

telling me to our wizards that they will

they will be able to go conjure up the

thing that you need okay we can

investigate

okay the drop sure it is I'll have it

tomorrow

okay except I drop her any principle

yeah there's no water his eyes we should

discuss discuss in perhaps a little

greater detail what you're willing to

offer as far as payment I was given the

utmost authority to negotiate mm-hmm

well so if you're going to you're gonna

match a bid from our other various

handful half a dozen offers

since we arrived it's gonna need to be

in the range of ten fifteen thousand

gold and anything else I think we might

be discussing some a magic great sword

knighthood options I mean if you have

magic great swords laying around he

expects that this mission you guys are

gonna get like you guys are gonna keep

whatever stuff you recover from the

Underdark

except the crown right so that's

probably going to be there's gonna be

some magic there if you have if you have

something specifically it says we have a

we have a deal with a local purveyor of

rarities and antiquities we're depending

on how specific your needs are we Mabel

to provide them knighthoods we have a we

have we've become know where I am scuse

me we've come nowhere near or fulfilling

our quota for the year but that might

require more favors a stronger

relationship more trust after you

realize that if you if you are these

knighthoods would mean you that you were

in service to Marv right to our house

yeah we're the Knights right we may

require some provisions go to go into

the Underdark make a list

the the serving swain I think is with

her called uh brings the sky of the

train could be ordered and he starts

drinking it and I was like like holes

and isn't it like something dribbles out

any kind of it drinks the a listen

listen the taste buds know what's crown

says he points to the aliases it's

purely a habit at this point

understandable anyway oh yeah we we've

got your card uh yeah

angels like was I right about the sky or

what yes my players again he's gonna

kill them all with us with a skinny guy

say have we left in this place up to you

I assume you will at some point oh yeah

no we're just chatting about it now

outside of that guy's earshot yeah yeah

where's uh where's that my flare Minnie

they're only going if we recruit that

guy yeah so you had your chance to well

he didn't have those who had a chance to

here to work that one go to the sun's

video he's pretty dope yeah it's 2000s

now he's also dead we fed him to the

ship no no that's not the one who's been

there's that guy is down in the under

Garth mmm looking for work I would give

him come on you guys I assume you guys

are gonna head back to the Pharaoh's

dream yeah on the way out like like I

was ancient in more ways than one

commander just uh just speaking my mind

if I may I think we go grab this Abbot's

scroll knock that out

five thousand gold while this guy's

procuring

our needs for heading to the song with C

on a bit of a longer excursion bang boom

two jobs out of the way 20,000 gold a

little bit more reputation and then that

point you're talking about incrementing

the treasure day yeah like this do this

revenant like he'll pay we have to

increment the crew treasure day you'll

get to yeah thing like that six on the

treasure died you guys can buy like a

castle he was this guy misses dead guys

obviously a bit like a big fish right

look you get a job done but we don't

know where he stands on anything yes it

does have a knighthood from him gender

and I don't think we want a knight very

traditionally Rio no it's like as boots

is unique we want the money but we don't

know if we get them this crown what is

that I should say we don't know what

side he's on what that's gonna do my

additionally Rio noble yeah normal Rio

and are actually very different ideas

but that's my mindset is we're gonna

have to work for a lot of people

cheering cuz we're going to need to like

at the end of the day we need to kind of

band people together against how it's

how it's going down into the world below

furthering us up above to be able to

recruit more people for our cause and

talk with living nobles who well yes so

notoriety money is it the kind of

notoriety that was oh yeah we're the

chain attack Iran yeah like yeah but at

the same time like we also don't want to

further any of Ajax's schemes and if

this ties into that in some way well we

look like fools yeah my only concern

here is that the point while so is that

well this guy presents the option of us

continuing to work for him what he means

is that we will basically just become

his dogs

I figure well I mean he he did mention

that his superiors are not happy to be

disappointed by rejection I mean you

know he's got this old-school ryeowon

nobleman you know air of superiority

he's been

everybody so it's not better he's dead

it's like what kind of [ __ ] arrogance

does it take to be dead and just like

keep on running running games and

shadowy bars you know I'm honestly I

like the guy but I've gotta be happy to

take his money yeah Bing vitality

deficient gives one tremendous clarity

of mine where'd he come from I enjoy

eating and sometimes chiming in as NPCs

you couldn't possibly be there that's

good it's kind of like like what we

would picture them saying right well

it's also it also imagines that the

conversation you had with him was

probably longer and you know and had

more detail than the one we actually

just played out yeah and so I do

occasionally enjoy kind of giving you a

flashback to if you had said that what

was his response have been but you know

also I just enjoyed cheating you know

what you guys think you're out of yours

it's like a panel yeah yeah so he's in

the Pharaoh's dream now no but if you're

in the Pharaohs dream that concierge has

a message for you I think also we've

been here for two days we've already got

two job offers one that seems pretty

safe pretty standard kind of stuff

albeit a bit you know small fry another

one that I don't know if I feel like

we're desperate enough to take

considering where it's gonna bring us to

and what that means for up here bring us

to riches yeah I mean it's a big he's a

pleasure I'm pretty [ __ ] done with

the world below it's like [ __ ] not that

again do that this isn't like this is an

epic level campaign yeah but if you

Barbie doll

definitely it's engraved right no I

agree it's it's cool the city sounds

cooler than as long as you say if you

pull out that [ __ ] Barbie doll okay

but the doll well not only that but like

both of those are artifacts could be

like super powerful magic items that

make whoever ends up with them like yeah

a powerful in some ways the thing is

also what's this Kenway can we just got

promoted and Kenway has the shield of

doll wrath and some other crap and I bet

that this crown is something to further

miss has the shield he did know Matt

off-screen it to nicodemus works for me

now EJ you were there you were there

when you were like uh so it was wasn't

sweet sweet was it sweet and red yeah

that met with Lady Sarah I don't

remember

I don't know he had he had the he had

the shield Nicodemus was there but it

was kinda way that was holding the

shield yeah so I for one and not looking

to get any more historical royal

artifacts to give to random ass people

that's just my two cents that's my two

copper on it wait wait

so you're out for both of these jobs are

I think the first one what is the like

judging me like what is the first what

is the only jobs or just go and get a

thing and give it to a guy I get paid a

lot one of them is paying us like five

times as much business is business a

business is also personal the business

of capital at least at least the first

job keeps us up here right the first job

keeps us in capital something we don't

want to leave capital immediately mm-hmm

but it's a job that can't be tabled and

not done immediately we can always wait

until the another week and see what oh

they're all good I'm not saying jump on

something right now we got time mm-hmm

and we have other ship we gotta do we

can't show up there was a message on it

for you at the

right at the I was at the dr. e FB we'll

just talk about this we'll do our own

campaign diary over I guess we meander

back into the hotel all our jobs the

concierge points to one of the

restaurants and says there's a gentleman

waiting to speak you we're eating a lot

of [ __ ] food yeah it's up at the bar

right yeah one beer please

one job believe them there's a dude in

the bar who is like kind of obviously

the one who's here to speak you mm-hmm

because he's a an elf that is someone

flamboyantly dressed and he he's

drinking and when you walk in he

recognizes you and stands and says my

noble Lords any boughs and he's got a

cap he's got a white elaborate hat and

the ryokan style looks it looks like a

musketeer and he boughs and he takes his

hat off have you drank today not nearly

enough

I don't know round on the house he says

is it past noon uh it's about okay

listen

skating the line that's how okay

alcoholism starts there by the way there

are unusually for in your experience

there are clocks in the Pharaohs dream

but they're all like big and expensive

and there are air like I think they're

yeah they're 12-hour clocks and these

are mechanisms that like they don't have

in alloy they don't have in black bottom

so this is one of the only places you

would go to where people would refer to

things like minutes or anything anything

that short a time span all right

like you guys are not used to that you

guys you guys don't have watches I used

to do this you used to

you used to like a turn which is about

20 minutes which is one turn at the moon

[Music]

anyway just meaningless detail my job do

I have the honor this elf says do I the

honor of addressing the senior officers

of the chain of macron yes why yes you

do I am the Honorable Pro student

Elizabeth Percival Tazz I believe how

you pronounce it I know how to spell

that usually the real word yes I looked

up the same really the same sort of

nomenclature research stuff that you did

what was the name again a lift with

Elizabeth yeah but what's then that's

not it it's his title person does this

title I represent the Royal heraldic

Society heraldry heraldic device soldier

art direction we've commissioned me I

perhaps foolishly described a piece of

art installs and followers as having a

heraldic device over it and without

thinking about whether or not the artist

with I meant what we got back was like a

mechanism I was like I'm stupid like I

live that quiet I use that wise I think

what I think my obscure nonsense would

be good oh good that's that's bad our

direction don't use words no one's ever

heard of these words that no one's ever

heard of in art direction and so he sits

and bar bartender brings you folks

drinks and he says one of our couriers

was sent to the library at our Gia over

on the pellet it was a require a

notarized copy of a government document

perfectly legal he seems to have

disappeared and we were hoping you might

be able to locate him we fear something

untoward

mm-hmm how long ago was this two days

ago

of a courier is of course a tragedy and

of course we would like in return

moreover we need that document well

we're not sitting foot in capital

without the ability to carry our weapons

with us the pellet is on island oh ok

it's just a smaller island and it's kind

of Lauzon shaped and they're called the

pellet who occupies the pellet oh you're

new to the city yes I of course I forget

forgive me pardon me is my honor to

explain to you the local political

situation and he just he's currently

like there's a the pellet is it's a it's

a it's occupied people live there it's a

it's much smaller than the stays and

it's currently like basically a freehold

like it used to be the princes territory

and he's dead

mm-hmm it's like free-for-all well it's

it's there it's like what's the line oh

good it's no no it's not that kind of

it's more like the local governors will

maintain Authority I'm so like the

Prince is dead but the infrastructure

that he ran is kind of ticking a lot

without him

and but like Technic technically the the

people who run that place have no legal

authority to do so does the dude they

get their power from estimate hmm I see

what was on it was an agreement between

a former prince of capital and denied

das sir fleet che Bernadette II the

grievin has the Prince's seal on it the

descendents are solely children's an

antecedent of his going back many

generations yes the descendants of Sir

police would like to work the princes

device into their family crest but we

have our standards they must prove some

legal ancestral connection this document

would give them that I see it is I'm

sure a very obscure minor detail for

noble soldiers such as yourself but it

would mean a great deal to house

Bernadette

I love legal texts how much would it

but we are empowered to pay why do you

why would somebody want to stop you from

getting this document we have no idea

perfectly mundane piece of paper are

there any enemies with family that you

believe might be responsible for this

disappearance I'm assured you that the

that sort of Philly che is of the

highest normal birth I'm certain of that

but certainly there are jealousies well

I mean it's it's difficult for anyone to

live and work in a city such as this

without making enemies it is after all

the city of the great game so just so I

understand real quick this is just a

character this is probably I regret

asking you actually now that I've now

that I've met sirs in person you are far

too impressive for a for a job such as

this I'm I'm sir I'm sure there are some

cell swords in a local tavern we can

hire I apologize for bothering we

haven't said no apologies necessary

we just like to get all the details

before putting ourselves at risk Oh

little risk I assure you mostly just

inquiring at a library well I mean risk

of our reputation oh I see well that's

of course I appreciate and keep in mind

there's many members of the chain oh

well perhaps some of your some of your

rank and file could be sent you to the

job sidequest

yeah all our mission alright

yeah it's possible but we want some more

details so what well I know I'm so much

at a loss I'm not sure what more detail

there is it's as I said it's a it's a

scroll about 300 years old it has the

princess seal on it it's a it's a legal

document perfectly mundane there are I

am sure thousands of them in the library

you've you've been you want me you

wanted to recover this particular one

well we sent a courier he didn't return

we were sort of of the mind that perhaps

sending someone with a little more skill

oh I see it's not that he lost the

document it's in the place over there he

went to get it he disappeared gotcha yes

has the right of it okay not that he was

holding it and lost it and we have to

track it down unfortunately we are the

courier was lost oh yeah so he might

have been holding it on his way back and

gotten something I honestly have no idea

why anyone want to risk life or limb

over such a trivial item it's quite

beyond me I assure you and I'm sorry too

I know you went over this but the the

house that is requested get its document

yes yes what is pretty dead

brunette

yes a very old ryeowon family yes sadly

fallen on hard times in recent in recent

centuries do we still provide

knighthoods that would be a matter of

some delicacy I could inquire

that being said like the the Albert

Society has a quota of knights that we

have not fulfilled oh yes

so for Britta did he you said they'd

fallen on hard times does that mean this

job doesn't pay that well well it's a I

I again is I feel somewhat as though

I've overstepped my bounds I think

perhaps this job might be beneath such

such honorable and powerful soldiers if

I may say so as you you are obviously

very experienced and have travelled

across many regions and many worlds this

is merely an an island only a few miles

away or of course able to pay but it

would be commensurate with the risk

which I'm afraid is very little well if

we said we have junior officers who can

use a little extra money let's be frank

though how much money are we talking

well I apologize I'm not used to hiring

sell swords how much how much how much

would you charge how much how much for

say one soldier please a single soldier

there's no way that we're gonna just

send one soldier especially two we would

send for five well it was I surely you

know your business I pay I fear I'm

somewhat out of my depth 45 junior

officers usually half price obscene

ten thousand ten thousand you think his

hat goes I mean so but I mean he looks

like he looks like he's no rough spots

so maybe this guy actually looks like

he's been not doing really well so tell

us tell us more about your society well

we are we are though we are empowered by

the Prince of the hereditary power of

the city now now sadly lamented but

missed in order to provide and research

lineages for local Nobles very old very

old society one of the oldest one of the

oldest in capital you do primarily

research sounds well that sounds like

good especially may be interested in

that too I think we should do it even if

we just give it our junior officers

what's good ideal but what's the best

way to contact you he tells you where

the Royal Society's officer I wouldn't

say offices they're building their

headquarters that's the manor house it's

on the it's on this island if you're on

this kind of job was normally be around

five thousand but we can uh cut you a

deal for future favors yeah I mean for

such a for such a low risk operation

this might be something that like

someone with this gentleman's kind of

influence it might be worth doing just

to you know just to make that connection

oh that sounds wonderful just to get the

knighthood would you be able to offer a

knighthood to all of us it sounds like

you can get in get us in touch with

people who who can if the heraldic

society itself it's looking to fill a

quota so wait this is this is tom asking

an s any question but her role the

heraldic society are they like just

their own like stand-alone organization

with their guild capital

are they either like a particular house

or how would how would boots no that

would boots know they're [ __ ] ancient

he's live here yeah but that was ten

years ago and you know but you said this

is one of the oldest organizations and

Apple yeah but there are like there are

old organizations in the real world that

you who've lived in the real world your

whole life I've never - yeah but I know

the organization's no way do you yeah

name one I see an m1 you lose I'm trying

to think of what you might have heard of

so they're there they're a very private

very private organization that so like

Bhoots knows that there are several

different heraldry societies in the city

okay right it's kind of like they make

their living sort of inventing noble

pasts for people that have come into a

lot it's like one of those websites

where you look up your last name and it

gives you like your crest and your

family history and [ __ ] it is it is

however like here in Rioja they take

that stuff like seriously it's just as

bacon right but they it's important to

these people and these guys like the

Royal heraldic so it's it's so he'll

he'll say things like we're the Royal

heraldic society we're not the heraldic

Society of the the Royal Prince there

are those people are those people are

thieves like they as there's like seven

or eight of them and they all have very

tiny very microscopically different

we're not the People's Liberation Front

for the Liberation Front of the people

and this is just the local one and they

split they but they definitely like they

really do have a charter from the prince

yeah but lots of people do like aprons

so this it sounds to me like this is

something where like we could like we

might be able to leverage this guy to

help us set up like kind of a fake past

type of thing for the chain to be able

to operate in we

I do see how like we could use this to

benefit us like I feel like there's

definitely a way especially with the

fact that the work that they do is to

give legitimacy to people do every opens

know is that the idea that is that these

crusts I assure you I assure you sir

that the the noble houses that we work

for have all been properly vetted

I'll have legitimate claims to to their

title that's what I mean just to prove

it yes you sir you almost certainly have

some noble blood why just look at the

cut of your jaw and arch of the eyebrow

definitely uh definitely a man of know

full assess you yeah no I can see it as

well also royal and like recognizes like

like Rick you know that might be it

might be high time to reclaim some of my

slim okay I'm kind of thinking the jobs

in context of base so like the the first

one we got in this one it's probably

like a day or two obviously going into

the Underdark is gonna be more looking

yeah I mean you guys have a ship to lose

get you there yeah simply nitrous sprawl

don't worry we're probably want to do

all the jobs want to make all the money

make all the contacts um but I think

like you said we could I mean I I'm

liking this one just for like

establishing a relationship Steve it's

11 o'clock and for my own sanity the one

I would like to get out of this is know

what you guys are gonna do next so the I

so that next week when we get the other

play I will have the thing you chose to

do ready and get you that right now on

screen well no talk about it Morgan I

know what slim is doing what slow gonna

do Slim's gonna go check on the ship

okay next week oh that's right yeah it

feels nothing right next week so if they

lead it oh well then so have you choose

the Underdark it may just be the Slim's

eileen legit like yeah we can't do the

Underdark without slim but we might be

there I just wouldn't

well he just we need your sword and your

soul so for this for this for this

mission or whatever is this something

that we can send the junior officers off

or how would you know that well I mean

he says it's low-risk

it's on the palette which is like a

residential area basically it's a it's a

smaller city it's got its own districts

yeah it's not like the Citadel which is

a fortress it's been abandoned and

possibly haunted despite the students

literally just asking you to get on boat

and go to a yeah right yeah just check

it out go check a book out at the

library mm-hmm yeah this this seems like

we do that today yeah right kind of like

tonight

real time on the stream let's go those

of you in Australia are just waking up

right now welcome to the show come on

Gerry

where's your sense of adventure venture

yeah so we'll decide oh really oh yeah

so we'll uh we'll get back to you at the

beginning of the next stream it's noon

like you said like you know right do it

today today and we can we start the

stream here next week

where else would we start this is where

all the cameras are how many times

you're gonna do that one today like this

[ __ ] round three

go to Matthew Koval's Twitter and just

watch his him post his conversations of

the same joke I feel personally attacked

what do you mean what do you mean when

you say can we start here next week wait

where's cars talk on the bar and then we

can take it that way we can go just

straight on to the I think I think we're

probably gonna do this but we the

players need discuss what we're gonna do

so I just need time to get the I I need

time to get the content right yeah I'm

so we're you're gonna have it for the

next dream is that well but here's the

thing let's imagine let's imagine that

you say on Wednesday morning next week

hey this is we're gonna do I'll be like

okay I'll see you guys next week yeah

you know week now I'll have it to you by

Friday okay that's fair yeah okay

there's done okay we're gonna go to the

beuliss tomorrow ah you're not we take

the cameras will this so people get to

see there we're just gonna talk

specifically about the jobs their text

each other on Twitter we gotta think of

a better way to do it I don't know man

but we we got talking this time for

Jerry to go to sleep okay so thanks for

watching everybody the players are gonna

have a off line conversation you know

pretty good this is they're going to

talk about what they want to do which of

these jobs they want to take and

hopefully by Friday I will know and then

I'll be able to kind of throw some rails

in front of the train so it doesn't run

into the dirt and and have an adventure

have the first part of adventure filled

will not be joining us next week he will

be making sure that the somnium

tenebrous gets fed taking it on a little

cruise to the feed or there could be

that he'll be piling it into the

Underdark and just staying on the ship

and while these guys go exploring these

creatures do not have the strength nor

the will to go into the Underdark

without me say it that way what we're

gonna do next week anyway thanks for

watching everybody I'm trying to think

if there's anything when you die now and

so talk about here at the end oh we

don't know we're thinking about doing

something where we do like a rebroadcast

so there's a lot with this stream just

happening live again with chat but for

another time zone so people who are in

Australia or maybe you get to watch live

with other people to chat but we don't

know we need to communicate probably

won't be until I do another run in the

game video where I can say hey we're to

do that because those people need to

know what's happening

otherwise it defeats the purpose of

doing it so thanks for playing everybody

had a good time I actually quite like it

probably it's indulgent of me but I

quite like playing these embassy NPCs

and doing this stuff so no combat no

combat tonight just meeting people and

talking about stuff but soon the chain

of Acheron will be employed by somebody

in Capitol and I wanna thank everybody

who's still watching you were you are

core fans and we appreciate that and we

appreciate our sponsor you until next

week

be seeing you
