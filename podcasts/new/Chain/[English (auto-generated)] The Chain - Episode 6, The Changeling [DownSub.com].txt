really me

hello welcome to the show

I guess we're live this is gonna be a

little weird just because I'm going on a

vacation which means we are not going to

be playing next Wednesday night however

because we don't we want to keep up the

cadence of the show we're gonna play

tonight for you know 90 minutes or

whatever and instead of taking a break

and coming back we're just gonna stop

but we will then come back and record

what we're doing in an upload that next

week so we will take instead of there

being one show and then no show you get

half a show in a Pitchess I'm sure

there's someone's going to complain

about that but it means that tough luck

it means that we get to keep making

content next week even while I will be

on vacation because holy crap I need

Africa so before we get to the art stuff

we've got a bunch of announcements and

stuff you know

we don't run ads if you see ads it's

because you're not a subscriber if

you're an Amazon Prime via Amazon Prime

kind of paid sponsorship or anything

like that we have a bunch of twitch mods

working laboring tirelessly to make sure

the chat is awesome and speaking of

somebody who just ascended at nethack

our chat is awesome the people in chat

are super cool and supportive and it

makes me really happy it makes me feel

like this Queen is awesome thanks to

Jerry behind the scenes and thanks to

all my friends for putting up with all

this nonsense for those who don't know

we now have a second YouTube channel

where all this stuff goes all the stuff

we do on Twitch except the next don't go

so if you're wondering where the fifth

episode was and why didn't and I didn't

get an alert it's on our second channel

where stuff like chain reaction is gonna

live in the world building streams and

all that nonsense so but then my channel

is just gonna stay running the game

videos and campaign Diaries if you we

are gonna have a second kickstarter at

some point at some point early something

the first half of this year probably if

I get any more specific so I was getting

angry

but you are free if you want to know

when kingdoms organization can work or

when the kickstarter goes live there's a

link that you can find where you give us

your email and we will just email you

once and say we're not gonna sell your

email to anybody we wouldn't know how to

do that and wouldn't do it even if we

did and that way you'll get an alert

when the kickstarter goes live if you

are not already aware we have a discord

and official discord those were 15,000

people in it

and it is pretty remarkable there's a

whole bunch of really let me tell you

something in the indie discord in these

channel about the chain and the spoiler

channel there is at least one person who

has accurately figured out what the

hell's going on in the campaign right

now in the scenario we left on a

cliffhanger so that's one of the cool

reasons to hang out in our discord we

have a subreddit if you're not aware of

that where if you have questions about

stuff you're going to get great answers

and apart from that we normally after

the break we run the art that people

have been making but since we're not

gonna take a break classically I thought

we would run it now and kind of relax it

and wait until around

[Music]

he does look like one of those monkeys

the chain taro is gonna be awesome

that's a tarot card yeah that's an idea

well I mean yeah a fortune card where we

were yeah yeah Austin peace my friends

[Laughter]

yeah after you yeah he was just he

literally was waiting for you to foots

look like I love like the columns like I

just want to sleep imagine copper like

to see you guys wake me up with

something happen let me know that's

amazing really good

I had not seen that that is [ __ ] cool

man why do we have to kill nails let's

bring that guy back that's cool let's do

now the Catholic he's got the what from

junior officer to Catholic in just five

short weeks collision so that is it now

we're gonna play DD so we have we've

gotten a bad habit which weird we're

gonna stop now hopefully and that is we

all get together and have lunch the day

after the game and sometimes we hang out

here for like 90 minutes until like what

o'clock in the morning talking about the

game was gonna happen next and as a

result you folks patiently watching when

we start streaming the next week you're

like what hell's going on all this

credit how they wear this plan come from

so what I would like you folks to do is

just a recap like when last we left our

heroes you judge had come to the captain

officers mess and was describing the

king having seen angel just seconds ago

Wow angels in here and Kings saying he

was dead now revived angel said what the

[ __ ] and then you guys started talking

about what you were planning on

yep do you guys want me to recap root

out the imposter yes I think what we

figured out is well we realized that

something must have happened

simultaneously if we were thinking that

the angel that I was speaking to down

below decks on the roasted CLO and the

one that you found in your room we're

thinking that whoever this person is

must have killed angel and then came and

spoke to me and that timeline is kind of

weird but maybe it works out but then we

also were remembering um I thought we

thought that maybe they came to speak to

me and they found angel in my quarters

and killed him then oh we're talking

about and then the other thing that we

kind of figured out was remembered that

that dwarf that got stuffed into that

that crate down below decks that was the

same dwarf that we think big cat was

probably that and so we're thinking like

okay maybe big hat is able to kind of

determine like it and sniff out who this

person or who would this creature is or

whatever the case was just below decks

yeah this is Eric Oh see Lars doesn't

know about that

oh really no no all you when you

wouldn't talk about what you just walked

into the room and saw there was another

angel in here or also angel again uh-huh

George was like I just I do it and he

told me yeah but you didn't tell us at

the lunch either burden askew secrets

from you just so you don't like yeah

like you just had this conversation with

angel

yes walked over here somebody an officer

a soldier came and grabbed you and said

the captain want you in the officers

mess right and and in here is it so

unless angel literally up and ran past

you there was no way he could be here at

the same time you talked to him all

right like I don't think this is the

beat I don't be this is the imposter

angel I think it alar says is true which

is that whoever whatever angel I spoke

with yeah was the angel post killing the

real angel it also be to take over that

body or something it could be to

doppelganger things that would be extra

[ __ ] so

are there is that their doppelgangers or

gangers double Gators and that

explicitly says that Anna's conversation

happened while I found the body but he

was dead for seconds where's the

entrance and this isn't usual right here

that's the angel is the little halfling

looking they have none and a halfling

assassin with your mother-fucking oh I

don't know now he's probably like

standing like a bit back like sort of

watching everything but I don't use

blocks there are tables

there's a cut there's a couple of bars

there's like this is like a so there's

actually like a liquor bar which is

probably where he and then there are

tables okay this was our spot so there's

a bunch of weird like their chairs in

here that are designed for creatures

that don't have spines or indeed bone

wheels yes there they're like these

elaborately shaped almost like cups that

they they sink into yeah and angel says

to judge boss if there is someone out

there disguised as me there's no way

angel says there's no way they know that

King brought me back so they think I'm

dead so they're gonna keep they're gonna

stay looking like me they're gonna think

they've got you fool

[Music]

so we gotta let him keep doing that

chain signed a response to this real

judges pissed this judge doesn't like

being made a fool so judge is gonna he

feel like he's been duped basically so

this angel that's been resurrected he's

gonna grab him basically by the current

leg lift him up and be like like what

the [ __ ] were you doing here essentially

people we can't answer but can I use

this in such a way where it's like I

roll in intimidate to try and like if

this is like an imposter I can somehow

like shake it like shake them or

something like you okay it's gonna get

shaken baby syndrome

the imposter you don't do that doing

yeah this don't die I get it could be

anything

28 that's pretty intimidating yeah the

the Angels like okay I drop them and

then I think we're gonna do the chain

same thing right that's kinda what we

had discussed as doing that I said he

says yeah he says holy [ __ ] that's good

I was just dead do you want to change

sign to how's the commanding yeah I'm

gonna tell you the [ __ ] that Ken no I

just moved my guy up there uh-oh so he

went like this so I'm just gonna change

sign to him prove to us are you

he's chained sighs [ __ ] off sweet what

he said I mean what he said to us he's

sorry about that you give them a

sniffing sniffing you want is I'm just

saying it thinks I'm dead so it's gonna

keep pertaining to me so we should let

them keep pretending to be me and then

when we see that squirrely [ __ ]

we kill him

okay now you should keep it you hidding

then work I don't know what I know I

know but you're right if it sees me yeah

I don't know then it'll know well [ __ ]

where's the map I would really

there is a map yeah we can if this is on

the it's in the mess there may not be a

let me help you room on there the

corresponds let's see where's the mess

any of these rooms though like you've

got the power to lock him inside

right like you can tell the navigator

like do not open for anybody except for

me

well the galley is in the cattle deck

which is oh okay so well so the things

we want to do is we had talked about we

want to pull everybody together to do an

inspection to see who's still alive we

don't know how many people died down on

the decks it's like we want to use yeah

we want to use a big cat and copper to

go through and inspect and see if they

can suss out the guy or if the other

angels there we know to grab him mm-hmm

yeah you see angel up there then that's

automatic yeah because we know that's

not angel as long as we keep angels

somewhere safe but I'll tell you the

other angel what you showed I don't

wanna be somewhere safe boss its got a

gravity like I really want to stick this

in something we could excuse me guys

actually have you been made an officer

has there been any kind of like no I was

just passing through the kitchen here so

I mean there's probably gonna have to be

some kind of like ceremony but it seems

like there's more pressing things at

hand no no that's okay well you're I

mean you're you're probably the most see

savvy person in the group and now we

have a boat so yeah okay well you sure

your first name all right there you go

all right you see no sir he's the

captain of the ship

he's piloting him so I figured I don't

happen anyway so you're saying like a

some kind of disguise for an angel I

don't I've got this coat we could tie

some blocks to speed make it taller we

could just have copper by their shoulder

here's their big - this is a great idea

all the time when I was a youngster do

you have a bacon color or anything

anyway so so the Galleon here does not

match that no this is that that map is

not the official map that say I should

say not to scale

I reserve the right to create new rules

over honey the thing is by my Angel's

own like what he said is that like yeah

this guy sees that he's still alive like

he's gonna know the jig's up right yeah

so angel wine just stick as a knife in

somebody so just lost to him yeah well

if we find him then you can make it

stupid oh yeah well if we could tie him

up

yeah and let him get some information

out of them yeah yeah I think I like

that do you have do you like the rule

whole thing cause like I think we also

talked about using that as like a status

of the chain yeah tell like everybody

else it's like we call the army now -

for inspection I mean we just went to

that whole bottom we don't know like

yeah nobody the rest the chain wouldn't

know that sweets dead they wouldn't know

they're - right oh right the thing I

would tell you that that just relates to

you is that whenever the other angel

brought me below decks in the row so CLO

what he showed me was they rock the

dwarf whatever this is stuffed him like

crunched his body and stuffed him inside

of a crate which is why I'm a little

angels like holy [ __ ] we strong you like

it's something pretty it's not like a

normal human I don't think

[Laughter]

you know they get older we want to see

if we can find that angel first before

we do that

what do you want any of us you need to

rest and you send me my quarters you're

gonna get some time with them later are

you gonna get him alive yeah I like that

all right I'm gonna send him duh well no

he died in my quarters so the other day

know what your quarters is good idea

yeah no because if you come looking

something the last place is well that's

where he found his dead body that's

right left his dead body so how are you

gonna get there without anyone noticing

what we're are you right by it like are

there other people like milling around

outside of the officers not the distant

from the you guys are on the cabinet so

yeah

the captain's deck has it as a mess as

well but I think that's my so at some

point I will correct the map to make it

more like what I imagined okay almost

like a Star Trek deck plan that's right

where the ship is huge there's all sorts

of nonsense he's like all right we'll

just tell him do all right we'll send

him there we're gonna use the we're

gonna have Phil set up the door yeah

basically only one of us can open it so

he's just gonna hang out actually can he

get the Navigator right now to tell us

where angel is and see if it comes up

with two angel blips I will attempt this

thanks Lynn

captain so how so so Slim is gonna try

and commune sliminess the pilot the

pilots ability is he has a telepathic

link to the navigator which is sort of

the brains of the somnium to nippers and

what are you going to what are you gonna

ask

well I mean I asked it to locate the

creature known as angel

[Music]

it doesn't know who angel it's yeah it

was like it starts it starts going down

like the roster of the song you've never

said it starts listing you're lifted

like there's no okay

what about anybody who left my room like

people have entered in left my room oh

yeah they're like a history log like

activity log yeah no it doesn't it

doesn't it's not like it's not

definitely a show it's not literally the

Star Trek ship computer it's drive like

a way to plot of course

so does this can it tell me what like

we're creatures aren't like if I want to

say is there a creature in this room can

it tell me Thank You detective okay so

it all right it's not that specific

you can tell you how many people are on

each deck in any given time I can't get

more specific no PII no PII personally

identifiable information no I don't know

all right

yeah the ship doesn't doesn't keep those

records yeah ask if there's any life

signs in my room okay are there any life

signs in the commander's room okay don't

let's have angel go in there and the

door can only be opened by one of us

five or Phil can relay to let angel out

this is more this is an order angel

how's that expression he just really

doesn't want to be excited he doesn't

wanna be benched sorry even did sort of

his idea saying so yeah okay well if the

plaintiff navigator that only the

commander or or I get can have access to

this room okay this room being the one

that we just put angel in okay

so you guys all gonna march down to

King's quarters with angel it's all a

captain's deck right I don't know where

the officer uh I think I think the

officer courtesan commander I think only

the captain stays on the captain back

there well there are rooms there there's

C and D captain's dick there's a

captain's quarters there's the captain's

personal say I am a personal slave

where's my purse I'm sorry you yeah you

had there was like a gift was the

personal slave before there's a leaf

guard you could make that my flare in

the brig your personal slave mine your

lair and our egg is food for the ship

but I guess I was asking I was

suggesting that we basically all

accompany him just after what happened

to Sarah that dwarf like definitely very

suspicious of everything right now so if

it turns out that this angel is still

not the real angel which is unlikely but

possible uh I just don't think anybody

should be like left alone has angel

gotten any memory back I know it was

like kinda groggy when he got up but

does he remember anything else uh about

the fight like his first reaction was I

need to like I needed to drink him lie

down and he hasn't got to do that but

but he remembers he had something

important to tell you so yeah so cuz

it's safe to assume that Kings quarters

are on the command deck that's yeah one

fifth floor down yeah all right I will

I'm gonna check with the navigator and

see if there are any living beings on

the command deck which I mean if there

might be like a couple junior officers I

mean he wouldn't know that but yeah I'll

say yeah or three of them well I can go

down there earlier ahead of everybody

else and tell them to clear out you can

tell them together so judge is gonna go

down and say hey everybody on the main

deck everybody we're gonna do we need a

chat and you guys are gonna go down and

you guys are gonna take the elevator

down to the contact

after you've done that mm-hmm escort

angel down to John the Kings Court yes

yeah I'm just wondering is there a way

for like obviously we wouldn't know when

an intercom is but it's our way for the

ship to lights I'm like well I mean the

it's it's this is a ship for a bunch of

mind-reading

new creatures so they didn't really have

a need any kind of built-in system they

could just go where's uh where's the I

on stun cuz I'm gonna use it you gave it

to me though

I didn't give it to you I let you look

at it alright you think we as actually

the other character in the game might

know what this creature is like yes or I

guess we're just assuming it's a role

for like you know anyway you guys

already did the Chronicle didn't King

look something up The Chronicle guard

know about that but we don't you know

anything really about what it is cuz

people don't know what the face is

garden doesn't say if we know type two

creatures like Michael attractive what

quality what like you know undead face

like what do you know about it that you

might use to like look up like what like

what do you know that it does it could

use this kind of look up yeah like I

don't know I don't quite remember what

the faceless card is I've been like see

if I can that's what I'm saying like if

you if you had a list of things that it

could do well it did this and it did

that it does the other thing what

monster is qualified doing all those

things then you could make it shine all

we know is it as I I can track certain

types of creatures or at least know he's

in the area so I was like thinking if I

knew the type of creature it was I can

see if it's mm-hmm or if we think it's a

doppelganger yeah I don't know what a

doppelganger is that I'm like

type what what type of that as we as you

know totaling a monster three or

something like that yeah it's an

aberration I think aberration so this is

the go ahead for you guys on hunger hmm

one went on first right yeah okay or do

we assume that our you know so you are

you always going down first together

than junior officers that are down there

right gather up the troops

sure and then and then then you do that

okay

yes so then the guards well I mean I

assume you could just go until them we

can't all fit you're right that's right

no you're right mounted here you and

yeah yeah here we go minis for this

excuse me let me just slightly I mean

you can see otherwise if you don't think

it works

baby elevator well this is huge this is

a huge Dean feet across and ten feet

deep this is like three times bigger

than any other baby a minute

yeah all right

you guys ride the elevator down and the

so yeah the door the doors open so the

big cat can get out and then angel turns

to judge and says hey Jax why do i

intimidate do anything so that this can

and I'm doing that it does exactly

well I mean you're not surprised oh my

god it still looks like maybe you're

very maybe angel was just an agent of

Ajax maybe always but he has one HP well

he's not a halfling I don't think what

is that what does that mean cuz if he

was any kind of employment creature that

wanted to pick a fight with five or six

other people plus a displace your base

he probably has more than one HP he's

just saying it when you robot when you

use that fella I know I don't know I'm

just saying like in this specific

instance I think that particular

creature has more than way HP yeah [ __ ]

it this time for real boots which are

initiative uh twelve slim twenty-two

king twenty judge there ain't yeah uh

cop twenty-two who else was look who's

Kings things and slowly for you also to

I do I was twenty-two you uh what's your

dexterity cause that's how I assume I'm

yeah you're right and so if I understand

how surprising what's correct I didn't

surprise me those of you who are

surprised okay

I made it I mean I just I just play this

by here last time and keep it in check

[ __ ] it yeah and I point out that I

wasn't using real rules for surprise and

suddenly I was I was the worst dungeon

master holy crap suddenly they really

look Saracen next Aaron I think it's

just you guys don't go back that's true

it's like the Pirates code yeah take

action down the first ring yeah

so copper is surprised

Slim is surprised king is not surprised

what all right I am

cuz the highness don't you notice out of

the corner of your eye angel do what you

normally would never have noticed you

know angel doing something squirrely

squirrely like a start he's turning to

judge and and if not for your heightened

alertness angel would be about to attack

Jeff maybe kilcher well let's see about

this I Castle person on okay DC 15 what

and what are what does whole person say

it works on you can see within range

right yeah

what she currently is humanoid is a

category of creature yep which includes

stuff like some happiness and yes yes

phase and a half legs form right now

okay yes

would you say your initial was good

excuse me who's that I went away quickly

enough that I couldn't read it yeah

it's also good that is practically

illegible so yeah let's take a look at

oh I can't you just a little prompt to I

can't use this kind of cuz they're

surprised you crack they don't get to

well no you can do that if you want to

yeah I'm judge what is what is their

ability as a bonus action she's the

senior officer in the chain they may

either move their speed or gain a free

melee attack word alright next 23 to hit

you hit yes are you 10 damage we roll

your one right no it councils it to

salute you so to it alright so how much

damage 11 damage but because it's a

melee attack does that mean because oh

no it's an action I get two attacks I

only get the Rose will attack so you're

so you guys are all so there's the whole

scene is you guys are all riding down in

this elevator

with the Olympic music playing and the

camera is all you guys does you're all

facing the thing and then the doors open

big cat gets out and angel turns to

angel turns us back to the camera and

looks at judge and and with no doesn't

have a weapon is he's got dagger but

doesn't appear to be using it says hail

Ajax and then commander King says judge

and judge instinctively because judge

doesn't get an action right now but it's

a bonus action as a result of Kings

commands sweet instinctively swings is

giant to him

tiny little [ __ ] elevator and and and

clips this thing's shoulder you know you

hit I need everybody in here except

copper to make this is a psychic ability

is this a psychic ability

is it a psychic ability it's a psychic

is it magic I'm trying to think I'm

thinking about the magic nothing that

you definitely have imagined resistance

I think it's just innate magic I don't

think it's a psychic ability I don't

think this thing is psionic okay it's

like a mind flare so that means I get

advantage right yeah it's just right

okay 14:11 19:19 so for a moment

this figure transforms into this

star-shaped headless alien being with

multiple twisting limbs and they go

through it it goes back to being angel

and in that moment those of you who was

you're all 11 and you yeah you two are

both eerie you're like what the [ __ ] was

that

while frightened you must take the -

action move away the sabia the safest

route for each of your turns unless

there's no one to run if you end your

turn in a location where you don't have

line of sight does whatever angel is you

can make

so we're just sort of stuck in the

elevator then and now it's that means I

can't be frightened [ __ ] I don't know

why I keep remember I thought I read

somewhere that like well no there's a

surprise around so it's copper that's

correct

judge was surprised judge does not get

back so now it's copper you hear some

crazy [ __ ] going on the elevator get

them you hear you hear slim man judge

freaking out which considering sort of

judge that's whatever it takes them

freak out it'd be pretty [ __ ]

remarkable

okay I'm gonna dismount it's half my

movement transform to creature in there

to creature you know actually yeah

that's fine I'll shoot okay

just figure out how you and I can switch

response

actually Oh judge when you attack this

thing you notice that dead side the cut

that you caused in angels shoulder it

doesn't bleed red bleeds this black

substance that when it hits the ground

it starts dissolving through the floor

16 the sixteen does it okay please

please watching it I see sixty

[Music]

9:18 hits so 9+10 and so every time one

of these Aerosmith's this black it's

very it's not it's not biscuits it's

very water like seeps out of the wound

when it hits the floor of the song yeah

mattress and it creates this acrid smell

and it just eats away at the floor until

eventually like you can see little holes

just keep shooting until you fall down

I'm gonna do a keen eye us also on them

okay so that's good

all right

[Music]

they've the 10 the DC is sorry 8 plus

they see it Chandra so I know I know

what I know what number you need to beat

what did you get I don't know yeah

you're like whatever this thing is about

to happen

it looks like a halfling but doesn't

move okay and I don't think big cat can

really get in there so I'll just I can't

step forward well I'll get in the way

I've always feared that's right so

doesn't really matter

well whose fear toy I wanted him to

attack but if he can't attack them I'll

just squeeze on in here

excuse me 17:6 I hit and I do 7 8 9 10

damage got more more liquid someone

breathing yeah it's a burning yeah

burning mind flayer ship tissue you guys

are [ __ ] as you can see what looks

like this lattice of thin bones that the

flesh of the floor of the ship that was

copper big excellent slim is Braden I

know I'm trying oh here it is all right

so slim is gonna miss you step the [ __ ]

out of here

okay 30 feet away so we can the elevator

this is no see you can't see them very

correct the elevator opens out into yeah

okay cool yeah that moves it moves me

farther away from man well no it says

one frightened by the spell when

frightened by the spell you must take

the - action

okay you mutt that creature must take

the - action can't and move away move

away from the caster by the safest route

eat your turn unless there's nowhere to

move if you can get out of line of sight

then you can make another wisdom

otherwise you're just do this you say

you do the same thing that gif did in

the room before where they just run to

the wall they're like alright but I mean

I would have to step closer to him in

order to do this that's that's why yeah

that's their goal is to keep doing more

all right um I guess my god just

standing [ __ ] his pants wait why

can't you get out because it's he has to

use this to actual action to get away be

the safest route and moving that way

would be getting him closer to his enemy

as the opposite appear fear isn't run

and your enemy it's my way and he is

maximally far away right now alright I

can't do anything then that's the idea

that's what that's what fears for that

was slim its king since we move in

succession can we do a shift I'm gonna

take an attack of opportunity but

that'll allow you to get closer if we

heard this thing much warrant fall to

the floor

it's gonna get away we're not gonna be

able to move through here and then uh I

guess he's gonna get attack opportunity

when I moved through right do it

disengage to do it as my action yeah

I'll do that that would be my turn

it's just engage with my boots or do the

same thing I'm gonna disengage them I

wonder if we should try to pull them we

probably should have done that can't

just leave the afraid guys in there to

get killed

yeah thank you can I just grab slim and

fireman carry em out of eight out of the

elevator sure try to shake them out of

it all right

yeah so get me out a lot of site teacher

what's your strength my strength yeah

what's your care for smooches what's

boots the strength 10 1009 all right so

the best you can do is spend your

movement like it and getting him

awkwardly up on your shoulder but that's

gonna be that's gonna be the end of your

turn because you're not strong enough to

just put something about 300 pounds so I

mean something it's up to you you don't

you don't you you would you would know

you know how strong you are and you know

how big he is and how he is you've never

tried to lift him before but you're an

educated man

yes so if you don't want to if you don't

try that you don't have to but if you do

want to try it you're the best you're

gonna be able to do is go over your

shoulder that you're not playing on the

next train you could you didn't know I

was gonna make you do an athletics

result would be so I don't want to

penalize you who wouldn't know who would

know

wait I am NOT Arnold Schwarzenegger and

he's a big dude so I don't know if I

would actually but that's true well I

was thinking sir you remember that I

remember that match years and years ago

when Hulk Hogan lifted up Andre the

Giant the body slam yes

[Laughter]

there's epic it was pretty epic just

don't body slam so like next turn would

I be able to yeah if you want to see

yeah absolutely yeah all right so I will

do that we're still in the things I've

posted you know is is like way more than

I anticipated

and everybody in the elevator to make a

dexterity trick is it possible that slim

knows what this thing is given that he's

from this from the astral plane

this is not something native to the

answer wow this is something these guys

brought with them

guys would you say dexterity yeah is it

against magic

yes a dexterity 1718 I hurl the net 20

so first of all thank you

I wrote a bunch of ones one on one

that's good 2 2 so 4 5 6 7 10 18 18 what

did you get 18

you're not in there well we can't get 13

so big cat takes 18 points of damage I

think everybody else saved what did you

roll 20m what did you roll I'm not good

at in there slim is what you're oh yeah

so you guys all take 9 points a fireball

this thing just drops in there

jeez damn fire those are for us who work

on this fun oh yeah I mean sorry how are

you really right judge it's your well

can I um I mean

so I think I get to use my hellish

rebuke in that case because it doesn't

see it has to be a melee attack or a

melee damage it just is the creature

that damage you is momentarily

surrounded by halle sh flames and it

hits you had to make a dexterity saving

throw and this is gonna be a I believe

this is the second level thing because

thingy that's cool

you can do that even if you're feared if

you're a Furby I think this is reaction

fairly mean yeah he doesn't say you

can't take reactions yeah it just means

you disadvantage on checks and a tax for

your target that feared you is in line

of sight so I can actually attack that

guy it's just on my turn I had to take

the dash action or else I would but

actually I was gonna either use it now

Byzantine use it because I know I'm

gonna get and I talk of opportunity

whenever I run past it

oh yeah you have to drop whatever you're

holding was right I don't see the only

thing hasn't ended drama your spear each

creature who fails are say and drops

whatever is holding becomes fighting

from duration you were holding your

sword but you can it doesn't say

anything about not being able to pick

takes reactions yeah misspelled anyways

I make my sword for it okay yeah so I'm

gonna cast this and then my spell save

DC for the next area to check that

they're gonna have to be make I'm just

gonna feed 16 I believe let me just

double-check that real quick somewhere

yeah it's sixteen damage okay like that

so my damage to t10 it's actually I

believe 117 damage

judges scared and pissed on this thing's

turn you notice it's wounds

start to close so that was your hell is

rebuked it casting fireball yes inspire

damage I don't know if that makes a

difference it does make a difference

good it is resistant to be serious yeah

actually I'm resistant to fire too is a

fireball yeah

[Music]

okay and then it's your turn

alright so I have to take the - action

to get away since I'm already like as in

a bad position as I could be cuz I mean

I can still - away from him no cuz that

would be running to him you could move

right here that way you go you can you

could move like that way I guess like

you can move to here that still look it

oh because I'm so within range of them

yeah you wouldn't get a drop - okay

he would not getting a dagger up to me

well if I stay were um I was previously

am I in a position where I get advantage

because of big cut well I mean his big

head takes up two squares right correct

yeah there is no wiggling right it's a

you're an attack in Kenya Tiger I think

so because I can't - right well then you

can't do anything this was my

understanding

well it says yeah it says well it's the

fear makes you find and that doesn't

actually say this is what frightened is

in fear you have to look under the list

OPA

so if fear the spell is finding the

condition plus you have to take the -

and get away and so frightened the

condition is you have disadvantage on

ability to check some tackles so yeah

you can still you can still overcome

your fear and

you're just you're dissonant things

you're afraid of that's how like spider

combat yeah so what I'm gonna do is I'm

gonna use I'm gonna use my bonus action

to put a seal on it and then that's cool

I'm gonna use conversation I name it I

can hear like a neighbor's okay so yeah

I'm gonna go ahead and use my bonus

action to put one seal on him and then

I'm gonna use magic missile because mr.

boom

yeah for magic missile it's the first

level so I do 1 d 4 + 3 + 4 is that's a

4 5 is 14 14 damage yes okay as a react

on your turn

it takes action like a reaction no it's

it's a thing that can do it's an action

you can take on someone else's turn and

it turns into a cloud of gaseous vapor

can you read the ship can't track it

[Music]

you can't see that anymore so you can

say it but where are combat because you

guys if you actually instantly wears off

because you no longer than last night

another creature trying terrified I'm

scared okay I was [ __ ] right just so

everybody's aware I didn't see that one

coming yeah yeah welcome to being a

senior officer problem that's let's take

the elevator down they went down yeah

yeah the elevator as for me you guys are

you got the doors already oh the

elevator doors are already open are you

guys getting it back on the elevator and

take your father down well it went down

it did but you don't know where well

what else are we under wait a sec okay

we're gonna how far down you can take

the elevator

how far does go you got several decks

we're on guys we're just on well I guess

we take it down each floor and look for

blood outside the [ __ ] door and

whites wounds closed no maybe we should

stick with the plan

Lester everybody on the on the top deck

because it knows our plan so big head

didn't react at all to angel this is

what we don't tell matter plants is this

ship evil I know that I can't tell you

what or who it is but is it able to

track the movement of a life force yeah

it's able to talk it's able to describe

where like how many creatures are on on

each floor does it but it doesn't know

what so we can't tell the track not

humanoid life-form doesn't know

about I guess that's not strong it's not

actually a Star Trek computer but it can

read it can read - it so can it tell us

for instance like okay obviously a new

living creature with mine signals just

entered a particular deck or something

like that well really that information

what you can what you can do is you can

ask it like how many people are on your

deck and it'll tell you and then you can

just say like well they're alive up but

give me a live update a beginner will

just say all right now there are there

are 27 life-forms on what they can add

deck there are 28 life-forms and that's

how you know okay somebody just arrived

you're right slim can we turn on

notifications yes but so you fought it

now you can track creatures right how

does that work I mean I suppose it could

be a survive like survival check I can

also do that well it's it's just lets me

know I can pick a type of creature and

I'll know if it's in a mile radius okay

not like specifically yeah so doesn't

really help oh you found its cat but

maybe to follow the broken sticks so you

here so the navigator yeah it's updating

you regarding how many creatures there

are on each deck and there's like 27

creatures on the cattle deck and then it

says now there are 28 and then you guys

hear through the floors there down the

whole the floor you hear a scream got

[ __ ] you guys take the already down to

the

you guys piled into the pack yourselves

into the elevator and ride it down to

the Cal deck and with the when the deck

opens there's a another corridor and you

see a bunch of people standing around

there oh you smell this horrible awful

smell of burnt flesh fires a lot of lots

of soldiers standing around whom you all

recognize and they're all middle it was

like a knot of them in front of you

facing away from me I'm just never gonna

run up and be like what do you guys like

it at or like you know have you seen em

the same they they part and you can see

like there was a circle of them

surrounding something and ox and Roach

and butts all this is all the junior

officers are all standing around and

there was a charred body like like

smoking charred body humanoid

right say who was that and two shoes is

like we need a head count who know who

is the charred body honor they don't

know

no they just for the screen do I notice

anything on the floor like sleeping in

together everybody else yeah because if

it doesn't come we can use the

notifications to know where the [ __ ]

thing is are there any acid marks along

the floor from like it's blood dripping

um you don't notice any judge does

anybody one who's very perceptive I'll

use my you know mark oh my god I should

have mark give it Markham no I didn't

have failed

did you fail yeah [ __ ] what did you hear

officers supposed to be gathering

everybody up onto the the main deck

that's what they were doing down here

they were grabbing well they need to

keep doing that

you see if I can certain see I mean do

you want them to do you want them to

leave no I don't believe what was the

last update that you got from the

Navigator that there is a new person on

this list on this cattle deck but it

hasn't decreased yet Wow must Yahoo yes

it went if I won and then it went down

one actually it's gonna like at the if

you're gonna let like what do you want

them to go report to the main deck what

do you want them to stay here because

otherwise that numbers gonna change a

lot as they start beating up mm-hmm

because this is a cattle deck like the

main the main floor that kind of decks

so like the a deck which is the huge one

is the cattle back oh yeah this is like

the closest you guys have to

amphitheater so it's a room on them it's

a room on the cattle neck which they

also call this so it doesn't have like a

top like outside no how do they work

with the sales and stuff

there are gang plants and stuff that

there but there's not a huge like their

walkways they go all the way around the

outside but there's they're only usually

about five feet wide and there's a lot

of rigging on the outside you can climb

but it's not a huge black deck it's not

like that

so crazy that's not gonna work it might

work

you know right now so King what is your

what is your or do you want these and

they said 28 people there yeah when he

said on that's 27 what other decks have

people on them we can use this Navigator

just McConnell deck in development just

the cattle back in the battle deck

[Music]

so I think we bring how many people are

on the battle deck how many people I

said with 27 money so it was like 15 I

think okay

and can we you the Navigator can't do

[Music]

six six oh wow so we've got twenty wait

I mean she said 27 yeah you've got like

33 people you had more but then there

was a battle for of this ship yeah

including nails casting fireballs and

killing some of your own soldiers you

said that judge doesn't notice any like

acid burns on the ground but he said

that in such a way that it does that

mean that somebody else would notice

that information well you're not a

trained tracker yeah it's alien ship

there's all sorts of weird I got some I

got probably the best eyes yeah can i oh

maybe try the perception our survival

check to see if there's a survival show

so you're just looking for tracks it's

just in this case the tracks are acid

for what I probably don't find anything

11 no there's still this on this deck

there's still this like milky substance

that's flowing downhill that is really

thin film e-liquid but it's covering up

a cat tracks yeah you should we have the

navigator walk down walk down the house

already a panic if we just lock the

doors down and nobody knows what's going

on and they've been told to go up top

deck when we said top deck we assumed

there was a top deck right yeah well

yeah you would have told them to go to a

sample they hit a mini room the main the

main room right oh we got to take them

there and do a head count right I mean

that means well there's more people in

the battle deck so yeah there's only six

of to shoot sir what should we do

who's she talking to you Josh your

commander sir what should we do okay

stop to shoot because dude two-shoes

like she knows the chain of command like

why would she ever um Tom two-shoes and

I will go get the other six people and

you guys will get these people on the

commander how about that

what did you want me to to him so you I

want you Phil and Tom yeah judge slim

and the kind of the boots to take these

take everybody here to the command deck

and then me and Tom me and copper and

two shoes are going to go get the other

six people so you guys can spot I mean

do you want to put all these people

alone what the thing and they have the

Moga fireball without anybody to like

them I'm in the fighters that's why we

split up because those are the six

people so we do a head count

we're not gonna send the junior officers

off to do it and see if that number

decrements if we just put the ship in

locking start quarantine that's true

we're getting updates all right so let's

take these 27 people into the

amphitheater say we're gonna be right

back and we're gonna get the other six

people and lock that door behind us to

me yeah okay

okay so now your plan is what exactly

we're taking everybody here to the

amphitheater okay we're gonna put two

shoes in charge right now do we want a

selfie shoes what's going on now a

retainer I tell to shoes what's going on

sir yes there is some sort of you want

us you want us to help escort she says

pointing to now we're gonna escort

everybody - yes later together yes and

then you're in charge or we're gone

there's some sort of shapeshifter don't

know shapeshifter yeah

something on the ship there's a thing in

the ship not to be confused with the

thing from the movie the thing I have a

question I know question for dishes so

two shoes where are you from from Miami

I'm sorry I was just thinking about it

the words the theme from from my mind

where you idata mind it to exploit

weaknesses and players but I did not

commit it to memory

do you play an angel angel the chains

the fake angel the chain sign sniff test

is no longer working either won't ya

focus the PIA in my to shoot two shows

last how long is this thing but on ship

most likely since since we left to shoot

yep alright so let's get him there and

go get the six people since we're not

gonna spell out okay you notice that all

of the all of the people on this deck

there it's it's like a traffic jam right

there's a couple dozen people just in

this one corridor they all come out

looking to see what the hell's going on

yet they're all soldiers and hey what's

what's this place called which employees

are supposed to meet report to the

meeting room headcount

[Music]

because you hear the soldiers talking to

each other about like like what like

what did they say oh I heard something

said something about doppelganger and

they're like wait what what does that

mean does that mean one of us could be

who was it that died who was it the died

whose body was that and no one can

remember they're all like I think it was

you know how long has it been since one

since that fried body I don't know like

sense like yeah at this point now a

couple minutes okay

it's on me like was it a human size box

yeah as a human robot as a humanoid body

summer between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. and so

they start as they're they're kind of

the soldiers are kind of they're still

soldiers with the panelled are we yeah

we we [ __ ] up because it's here right

you came down here there hasn't been an

update of a changing so the other six

people aren't it so anyone actually need

the other six people we have what we

need here one of these 26 my yeah so we

need to figure out how we're going to

figure that out with these people so

yeah we're gonna lock down all the rooms

on the yeah they're in there for a while

okay okay yeah no I mean definitely like

a

the mind flayer has a talent that none

of you have you get intubated right now

I'm saying Blair because he wants to

Hannibal Lecter all of us all right take

I'm just saying the mind flayer has a

talent that none of you have which is my

floor has telepathy

well telepathy is with the others so the

player can like actually see another

creatures keeping the mind flayer around

might be a good idea I know this

probably isn't the best time

where's-where's I do remember that I

know the best time so does that mean

first chance like so it is in the brig

which is a level not listed on that

habits between it's between navigator no

met no one open like of you so I guess

it would be like between between

feedback so it's be point you'll thank

me when you don't get your brain stuck

down he doesn't want this brain doesn't

taste very good I can't read them it's a

point boxes between between B and C so

actually well we actually you guys

didn't hear me say that I just said it's

not Satan that's true you don't have to

tell them the commands you're issuing to

the navigator you can just do it

so are you guys so here's the thing if

you guys go talked to the mind flayer

that means you're leaving people down

here we can't leave them here because

they're with the thing and the things

gonna eviscerate them I've seen the

movie the thing as soon as we yeah you

hear one of the one of the soldiers asks

two-shoes sir do we trust do we trust

the alien

who says that alien who says that's two

shoes make a percentage I [ __ ] won t

now subscribe perception what is

perception it's wisdom and I got 17 you

got a 17 yeah here there's a half-elf

soldier do you recognize how tall is he

I know somewhere between five and six

people it's that fat I [ __ ] I can I

do a snow so can I do like the health

lash thing all these all these soldiers

are all suspecting each other this

person asks what appears to be a

perfectly reasonable question do we

trust this random alien that we haven't

met before this just showed up he was

with it it's not him you just found it

upstairs

yeah the troops I am as commander

telling them that right now well I see

the glowing web show up her hands and I

say [ __ ] stop it

there's a half of all right by two shoes

[Music]

like to shoes is behind you guys as you

guys are all in this corridor obviously

this is not that this is not the right

man but two shoes is following you two

shoes is your ear accreditations

obviously she'll follow anybody

percent on the gift although when she

when she figures out these now a senior

officer shall obey but yeah you hear

this voice behind you in the crowd there

all sorts of soldiers talking and you

hear one of them asked two should

specifically sir do we are ma'am ma'am

do we trust do we trust alien orissa and

it's like are we supposed to trust this

alien now and two-shoes as you as you

turn around and and [ __ ] hell's lash

this thing to shoes is in the middle of

going man I don't know I don't know the

two shoes has ever seen a gift before so

yeah go ahead and cast slash think it is

basically like which balls yeah you

produce a whip of electric red energy

about lashes out at a creature within

range

creating a conduit between you and the

target make a range spell attack against

that creature on a hit the target takes

twenty ten fire damage on each of your

turns for the duration you can use your

action to deal one two ten fire damage

to the target automatically this is how

this this is how you get me pretty soon

this is how the changeling gets you

guess you two fight each other until

eventually there's only one left to

change stuff to ranged attack like an

Arab like you're shooting an arrow but

instead of using charisma yeah instead

of using it's a plus three form I know

your stuff yes yeah you're proficient at

spell casting we were at 27 she behaved

well then why six plus eight one knows

when went was it 27 28 27 I thought was

26 27 26

it doesn't matter and it was n n plus

one and I was making the joke that what

she's done to n minus one Patchen it was

a joke 22

yeah give it so what it sells last so I

do a 1d 10 damage I basically connect I

there's like a thing between us now I

hit the target takes twenty ten fire

damage fire damage look and on each of

your turns for the duration you can use

your action to deal when the ten fire

damage to target to the target

automatically cool if as long as you

concentrate I think this concentration

shadow and then I'm also gonna do is I'm

gonna use my can I use a bonus X right

now to problem yeah like SoundCloud

won't let you oh like if you play a play

you might my own playlist on my own

account when it gets to the end it won't

then start it'll it'll go play other

I thought you can hit the repeat but

we'll see I tried before it's ready

cheese oh [ __ ] yo just do that on

everything

I'm sorry tactile scream all right

what's the button yeah you hold it just

push it

you got the battery I kinda have

lightning bolt I don't know how this

works I don't know what it's basically

like you're gonna get from the tire

round of action okay so what would you

normally be a food so don't use my photo

section also place the seal on it so the

next time is gonna do max damage that's

awesome it's got a really good text for

my credit Trevor how much how much

damage did you do I did to two points of

damage

well do I add anything cuz it's like a

regional or is it just like it is some

says little one D Tim so he does I do

like one damage to move it to the right

guy I think judge actually has the right

idea like I know it sounds silly but

did you just kill the rest no no not

kill every time we hit them blood acid

so if we take our sweet time you're

gonna get a horn about how much time the

last it's only been a couple of minutes

you do two points damaged elicits unless

it's a thing in which case you didn't

[Music]

yeah so so you're you're you haven't I

don't know how often use you've used

towels lash so you're kind of new at it

but you definitely notice that this half

elf rank-and-file soldier doesn't seem

as as burned and is horribly affected

it's like so you see judge the hell's

lashes like it's literally a whip of

fire that judge with manifests and this

flaming whip wraps around this thing and

it does like burn through its clothes

but it only sort of cinches its skin a

little bit but certainly acting like an

half elf that's been yeah but it doesn't

seem to judge as though it's taking

enough fire damage based on your

interpretation and yeah so two-shoes

sees this and is going to immediately

attack attack judge I do not remember

sweet in a good in a good well

it's 2d6 this side of the screen nice so

yeah as soon as judge without without

thinking as soon as two-shoes sees judge

a cactus soldier to shoot spins around

pulls of a sword out and starts pounding

this thing and this thing is not if

whatever else it's resistant to it's not

resistant to steal this is great news

[Laughter]

and judgment I mean the two-shoes is

gonna find it nice yeah can you hear

what a soldier saying black gods I hope

that's the change so that's gonna be

initiative I like now you're like if

this didn't like a judge hadn't that was

pretty cool actually

yeah fact that I would I consider to be

a pretty reasonable question and she

just went and attacked it but even if

that turned out to be a ruse you guys

said you answer yeah but the plan wait a

minute please

yeah so we're gonna do is just draw

blood which we're gonna start blood bank

I mean I first thought judges going here

let's erase this and actually draw the

room because it's a thirteen oh we

didn't move in no you guys are you guys

are just walking down a corridor with a

bunch of soldiers on your way to the

hell right then like they're sort of

copper God which is at 13-13 slim which

are kosher I work for King what's your

name

nineteen boots 24 yeah judge 11 I'm

really lucky on this day alright so now

we're is a nice i crap war and war it's

a my fancy sock

let me get I'm shaving my eyes chat is

now a pun fast about judge judging

things let's try you just lived up here

in now people know why they call your

Junction it's made a snap judgment and

act yeah John florid yeah curiam

execution this thing and there's

actually yeah yeah

your whip is your lawgivers is that

there's all these [ __ ] soldiers down

in this corridor with you all on their

way trying to try and obey their orders

just trying to get off the fun of eating

just I got the goddamn astral plane get

back to her universe it has like a son

[ __ ] castle now when a goddamn squid

ship there was of course I'm playing is

it squid ship is a boon what do you want

to be mr. song I'm probably walking with

you thanks limbs like men there's a lot

worse things he could be on this

question

enjoy the squid ship oh yeah it is for

now but for now that was the original

King minion that bill did then I played

with a hero forge for much longer okay

booth is something judge is a judge

appears to have gone crazy and is

attacking there's definitely no chance

of judges to change I'm definitely

rooting

so it's it's booths action judges also

the senior officer here so I'm just

gonna whoa you know I've seen a senior

officer in another junior officer both

attacked this thing which case which I

also fireballed me so I am ready and

booing to the [ __ ] out of it is that

chat have seen the art that you drew of

boots yeah if you haven't seen it it's

on the website it's also on my Twitter

account but yeah and Tom's if you follow

tom on twitter i'm drew his own Tom drew

this is Tom through his own art for his

own character it's pretty [ __ ] cool

I'm running up there and I've got

advantage because yeah - shoes - shoes

and boots yeah so that's a 20 yeah do it

alright so I've got the artful swordplay

first time I hit with a finis light with

finesse melee weapon and etc etc ideal

an extra 1d8 so it's a d8 remember if

you roll anyone's they just count us -

so that's ten damage from one attack I'm

also gonna do my codomain which is the

this is the the dualist version of sneak

attack essentially all sides do an extra

3 d6 break that's another 13 13 this is

just a burglar repping right yep I'm

gonna attack with my offhand dual

rapiers that's another in 19 it is to

date - damage

so it it acts it does something every

action of time

okay so yeah what yeah what yeah yeah

well it's Yankee these your nicknames

not Makiki doodle gift Yankee doodle

doodle judge make a wisdom say that's

gonna be an 18 that's an 18 they just

haven't colored it all the way in yeah

okay yeah oh and uh okay since I hit him

you try to fear me again yeah you don't

know you don't know yeah nothing was not

it didn't look like it was didn't bleed

acid like beer is a well yeah it's we

get boots is definitely causing this

half elf to bleed this black it's like

good alright so I'm gonna spend a

dualist point and attempt to distract

him so this is whenever you successfully

hit a target with a weapon attack you

may expand a dueling point to distract

the creature give realize an opening the

next attack rule against that target by

another by another attacker other than

me has advantage if the attack is made

before the start of my next turn so

basically that's cool next person to

whack this guy gets advantage and I'm

also just dance dance dance all the way

of my face with your fancy boots I'm

actually you're just gonna realize that

like okay this whip as it is like really

not doing that much damage but the guy's

got a seal on them and like boots just

like cut his shut up so judge is gonna

go ahead and

consume that steel so that way of Bhoots

contra 2d6 damage i love boots relax

that's fun

he's seven seven thousand five thousand

tiny pokes that's I think what they that

was that was boots that was a long their

was long boots turn okay I'll go ahead

and cast guiding bolt it's a spell

attacks so would Chuck's thing work

tonight or no I have no yeah no the UH

the advantage I have no idea how much

socializing the next attack role against

the targets by an attacker other than

the distraction that wasn't like uh

against 18 hits print yes all right this

is weird cuz Claire's don't have a lot

of spell attack bones snap my fingers

radio my fires out the guy and does and

eighteen radiant damage huh

eighteen eighteen radiant damage that's

pretty good

and then next attack has advantage your

attack gave him advantage now his attack

gets the next person in man gets covered

man alright so yeah he reacts to that as

well what judge how does your house that

work I can see I can advantage on see

people who are invisible disguise are

hidden you get advantage over you can

just see them I mean you made the cost

yeah I have an event on the list and

perception checks to notice disguise

hidden or invisible creatures I think it

sound like I you just get to see them I

know

so yeah well yeah the the creature

disappears

okay and on your turn will have the

chance to look forward with your health

side but we need to check the floors

again all right

in case you move somewhere else well I

mean everything's closed oh right where

and that we're in the hallway but now

you get around your turn you can say

lockdown all right

that was King that's copper yeah I'll do

that oh there's not enough air lock oh

look footprints we can look for not

they're not good this points their

passion yeah because you need to be able

to track them hasn't this yeah also make

its washing so V by Q specifically to

stop cursing yeah somebody somebody

commented sacred you swear less and I

responded in care so copper yeah there's

a there is a banished got half elf

that's probably something half ounce can

just do your table you don't know maybe

how we just no soldiers here what do we

do general it's a big cat can't smell

him I don't have anything like that any

kind of detection hunting secret either

in cat even Humana she did turn to the

misty thing just disappeared did not

turn into a misty for him every run out

of spells list

[Music]

if I'd like area attack or something cuz

I can't just shoot emptiness you can

attack the darkness I mean you don't

have a target so unless you have yeah

cause if some I do have an area attack

I've hit my own

dude first in order to make that work on

them do we do that these guys are

basically like first of all yeah I'm

probably killing okay well can you just

shoot the spotlight just was shoot them

t spot that seems I'm gonna try out of

that seems that men seem like a thing

you can do that well I mean you can if

you can you can tell me where are you

thinking it and then make an attack with

this advantage and if you if he is where

you think okay six damage okay so the

arrow disappears as though it does

you're the best reach okay let me move

by the way the he went invisible but

he's still got glittering light all over

him from guy bolt what does that do that

does that reveal invisible issues no but

it would have given him

vonage he hit regardless but uh he'd

still be seen does it reveal invisible

creatures doesn't say it reveals

invisible people then it's a difficult

than its invisibly glittering with as

invisible this you got to think alike if

it's if it's a light that's glowing and

showing someone where where this person

is no imagine that person were blind

with a light help and that's this being

blind is the same as sartorius invisible

so I hit a target yeah they're gonna

send a cat up that direction because

okay towards the target yeah this is

like we were talking about cats chasing

laser beams that's true I don't know

where I'm going actually mark since he

hit Kenny mark you can see I can't see

yes it's big cat this is became yeah

with this disadvantage are you right

nope

all right I need boots to make it with

some sir 16

[Music]

let's see five everybody

everybody except the three soldiers

behind you two two two two so it's 24

damage if you beat a DC of 13 what kind

of 23 yep

23 if we beat it 23 do you believe it

I'm sorry if you if you if you if you

fail you're saving throws 23 damage if

you make your saving threads oh I'm

sorry what was the DC again 13 so if I

rolled it what if I roll of 13 I failed

it

no you beat it oh I need you okay

if you got less than 13 you take 23

damage if you go more than 13 you dated

11 19 4 5 it's a big I think perhaps I

made a mistake

yeah it's something you missing sweet no

no oh it's starting to regret so who is

this Mickey Mouse that's what they call

the cranium er heads its judgment it is

movement can I can I move up teacher

absolutely you can absolutely move judge

is gonna use a bonus action to cast to

cast another century on this guy and

then he's gonna roll to attack I don't

have an advantage roll with my damage so

that's a hit and then it's a 6 plus 5 is

11 plus 5 is 16 I think I can use my son

sure you think I didn't actually

activate it breaking now what is censure

what is that that's the seal and I put

on I think it's whenever I hit it as

well yeah all those guys did oh yeah was

that 1 2 3 4 5 oh if that's the case

then I would have gone up here that's

fine okay

let me just roll a d20 another view 20

just to see if I happen to get a crit

nope that's a woman alright so describe

what you're doing in you're putting your

you putting a seal on yeah so it's a

there's a rush up basically cuz I like I

like retract the width because a hellish

health lashes just not doing it they

retract the whip and then I rush up and

then I just do the [ __ ] like seal to

him and then Center him and then I just

took my um my big great sword and I just

start like wailing Adam essentially and

so um I do the first sixteen damage

tonight I go ahead and consume the seal

and then I do another two to six damage

whenever that happens 16 plus 8 is 24

damage so your 24 damage to a total 24

damage yeah yep and that's just regular

sword damage yes to d6 that comes out

necrotic damage oh yeah

all right George you attacked it correct

on your action make Elizabeth say it was

nervous that's a 10 that's the noise

[Music]

you are now a chicken here we're gonna

hate to do this I wish I'd if I were

better prepared

I've never be this program but I'm gonna

use two two identical miniatures

there are now two judges there's one

here and there's one here and I need you

to make a insight check actually no what

is your insight bonus you're right don't

hero Street dice roll you have new ones

okay what is my insect tell you here

only you can see this yeah no looking so

you look at this you look at it so now

there are two judges is it so my turn

I believe your turn is done again you

can even can you acting it was it was

reacting to he was taking an action at

the end of your turn just like a

reaction it's not a reaction it's like a

legendary action I message you something

like we should keep going and then I can

because this is like a permission to why

is it anybody I am I you stop the action

as I do this so it's slow

Wow

[Music]

I'm going to I'm going to go right there

and I'm gonna attack that one here is

that this one

okay because that's where the bad guy

was just so they both disappeared for a

second mm-hmm and then we're like a

50/50 chance right oh yeah that's

exactly you seen The Princess Bride see

if it not for a long time the Glee

passage on your turn yeah all right so

first attack I got advantage I assume

because of the soldier on the other side

there yeah 25 filled you favorite call

high or low high

okay okay and that's what great so that

AC or was that damaged that 25 yeah 25

was a see any of it all right so it's uh

this is with the silver great sword it's

a good is a degreaser it's a gift sorts

of give it becomes pretty great um

fighting right yeah I'm just I'm

thinking for a second here I'm gonna

spend this superiority day cuz I want to

do that cuz I haven't got to do it yet

and I'm gonna do a trip attack I spend

one superiority died to add a total to

the damage well okay that's the total

and then it's 15 and then if the target

is large or smaller must make a strength

saving throw DC 15 on a failure and not

the target pro what's the DC 15 yeah

this judge falls off a branch it looks

kind of shocked at you what kind of

blood is coming out what kind of blood

do teeth wings have really dark felt

like you don't have human blood is like

very much not the ass yeah like teeth

and what I think would be almost like

purplish so it's almost purple like

blood comes out of not not the blood not

the blow to change it you still have a

[ __ ] how many spaces did I did I run oh

did that just activate I think this just

got the messages that you got the

messages you were sitting in my phone I

probably have two left

alright move me into this there there

you probably go here sure whatever is

the best forget all right now I'm gonna

attack that one cool

I don't think I have advantage on this

one it would've been a way for you to

get it now you're getting it

there wouldn't have been a way for you

said they were standing nice you creep

yep nice okay so I'll just go straight

damage so it's a 16 damage 16 you damage

yes

that's from a creek yes so your old

damaged twice yes your strike one

yep I only get to add my strength mod

once right yes it does to your great

sword axe to it and as it dies it starts

howling and changing shape and it

changes it changes from Zarek to angel

to this guy and then a couple of other

characters in the chain and you notice

there are a couple of as its as its form

is twisting and permuting and like faces

are coming out of its flesh and then

going melding back in you if you notice

soldiers people you think are assailants

on the raw so see how the faces you

recognize from the boat you guys just

spent three days on and then things just

collapses in a heap and it's just this

it's this melange of all these different

forms you can see like angels furry

Hobbit feet and half of

the Xerox space and then there's just

yeah pile that's like it looks like a

corpse the steaming corpse that has all

of these different forms just melded in

do not judge so the angel you were

talking there angel I don't know I guess

I must have been I think this guy must

have gone up to the cabinets are the

commanders quarters and cut his own

throat

that's me said maybe maybe angel maybe

like that maybe angel Beadon maybe you

did name just looking for me but the

angel left him dead in my quarters ding

any shape you could take the shape of a

dead person there is one way to be sure

slim we'll go over and offer judge my

hand up definitely correct no John

that's what he asked he asked him what

judge black did not so judge is

definitely as far as you know I thought

I thought for a moment you might be

doing some Koval [ __ ] doesn't let me

go

choose the take of that thing I assume

so I could hear cuz we can't hear it in

here

another thing you had an ACEF okay okay

it wasn't it so yeah that's that's I

don't think any of you even know what

that is

Oh harvests blood

well what's his around right harvest it

because she's like a wizard what do you

want a harvest so no goop she would know

better than I would she she did she seem

interested uh I don't know that like

she's ever done like any kind of alchemy

stuff like that before like harvesting

brains and eyeballs is done

but she can give it a shot if you aren't

sure okay

you can go ahead well here's we have two

shoes do you have

I got a mom what are her skills Arcana

and deception

okay so then medicine Arcana is is one

of the two skills unity lemons Madison

so she's gonna be plus three on medicine

because she's not proficient in it and

then plus six and one that she is

proficient in so what are you trying to

quit as what do you want her to harvest

to harvest like the heart of this thing

the brain of this thing do you wanted to

get like files of blood you know like

pick one your basic enough to destroy

the corpse in order to harvest anything

from it being in the brain eyes heart or

blood brain brain all right so you gotta

make two checks one is our can check and

the other is advanced it's a check so 1

plus 6 it's like a little mini skin

skill challenge

all right the black will be Arcana and

next one will be the medicine I think

this is going so in that 20 on the

Arcana oh yeah she's like she's like oh

I found the brain she says she's a

slicing into this thing she's got like a

regular knife right and she's like and

she's cutting she's like a meals got

another knife and her knife is like

corroded oh well she got 21 on medicine

that's great but she's gonna like I need

more like I know where it is yeah and

she starts carving it she's like yeah I

got the brain in there she asks for like

a water skin it's a mammal our skin I

probably do I'm sure I've got one day my

in my inventory she takes a long skin

and she like cuts some of the string so

it's that's now water everywhere and she

pulls this small you know it's got like

a cerebral cortex but it's not it's not

pink it's this almost dark black cotton

have very strange flesh and sheep and

pulls this brain out of this thing wraps

it in the water skin

she's like emmalin is but i got its

brain over like a very rare light who

wants this yeah you know like a wonder

life right up I went out there any more

brains in there for free just okay

that's enough okay so the the two shoes

is like we should gonna have a service

for the dead soldiers some of those guys

were those guys just eviscerate it

they're just personal character yeah we

need a need to get everybody together

anyway right cuz what if angels really

dead and Zahra rock guys there's there's

one thing we sure that was the only one

of those things yeah I mean we but this

thing earlier rises on targets it's

blood on the ground

I think we've uh personally I've already

seen your blood we should do this with

like the rest doesn't understand these

guys down what we're doing they don't

they don't they don't have

they don't have all the fish I just tell

everybody report to the I forget what we

call the place the meeting room in there

with everybody for all together

amphitheater and can you reopen the

doors for those people so they again

yeah I'll reopen the doors so that those

guys can and then we'll all head in

there there's now a lot between a part

of you guys

there's no I think 27 members of

background left 27 left

yeah we started with 60 yeah this ship

you took this ship losing a bunch of

soldiers my balance of our guard oh yeah

Neil's fire held a bunch of them kind of

you know collateral damage I'm a god now

I don't care about morals nice and then

just fireball so yeah you guys all get

together in this small it's built like a

map it's built like very small like a

favor I got like one of those classrooms

you have on there those teachers down

here in the stairs go up that's

artistically and they all get together

so wool will tell everybody line up and

then we'll walk down at the end of line

yeah the commander probably has to do

this yeah so no youna give any kind of

explanation if they felt like there it's

like a Rio Rio it's a Copa number you

like renew your vows basically but for

that for the chain let's say there was a

changeling on the ship and we know that

it bleeds acid and the one way we can

tell your real is that you don't have

acid blood then I cut my hand and let it

drip a soldier these guys are like no

problem

these guys are so fast okay yeah so no

acid blood no all right sir no sir Sir

I'm not changing sir well soon as one

guy I know they all do different they'll

and they start like you know doing

various tough-guy things to try to

showoff yeah everybody everybody

remaining on the chain

there's no as far I mean yeah and mercy

all they all seem to be authentic meat

bags

that's good

kosher the Navigator is there anyone

else on board besides besides who is in

this room no further life signs except

for a middle road with the other junior

officer is an angel knows exactly

Oh angel oh yeah last thing no there's

no left I mean sighs Eric he was pushed

into a cube sign Angie didn't find him

Cantus fam whatever name that the real

Wayne or whatever was said to you was

the yeah he just smiles here yeah yeah

yeah all of the chain is here yeah

we got to do our status update deal you

know all right

crisis averted yeah so at that point you

have all the soldiers you have all the

soldiers gathered in that in this little

like amphitheater my my bullet points

that I'm not looking forward to doing so

it does King actually pull out cards so

King has written speech no not really

written the speech Everton bullet points

King has written bunch of bullet points

on Carla's line like King literally has

these cards oh you bullet journal

nothing all right all the soldiers are

all waiting for King to talk yeah like

right here sir so as you all know we've

taken a lot of losses in the recent days

commander red is dead his successor

commander sweet is dead senior officer

nails is dead they live forever in The

Chronicle three days ago I was just a

junior officer some of you know me now

that I'm the commander everybody's

asking Who I am or was I born what did i

do before the only answer that matters

is I was born here in the chain and

before this I was the chronicler uh The

Chronicle tells us many times when the

chain was even smaller than us now but

it survived well we remain the chain is

unbroken while the Chronicle endures the

chain is unbroken we've made an enemy of

Ajax and he's made our deaths personal

but for us death is business uh our

outstanding contract is to kill one of

Ajax closest advisors he has sent agents

across worlds to find and hunt us he

means to kill us we mean to fulfill the

contract the one place we know that Ajax

does not want to be he's where we're

headed

capital we will find allies there I

think it's likely many of our comrades

in black bottom survived and they will

find us in capital

or less there's more of us than just

these these guys left

this ship is now ours and it's gonna be

our base of operation until further

notice those of you who have served on a

ship before report the boots he's gonna

be putting together a crew slim is the

pilot of the special a new lieutenant

will be appointed once we've established

a capital for now report to your

sergeants junior officer and senior

officer judge or myself in capital we

will need to rebuild our ranks capital

is a city of intrigue and marbles I'm

sure you will find plenty of opportunity

to keep your talents sharp you may think

a Gen X can't be beaten

three days ago it might have agreed with

you but there's only one explanation for

why stretched across the Timescape he's

afraid of us he fears us because he

thinks we can win and now so do I second

but yeah that's there the news by the

way Lars I do but I thought you called

me back yeah and definitely they like

they like they don't forget we're not

the only ones but there were other there

are other soldiers that survived they

had to survive the fall black bottom

there didn't know where to meet us so

and also when he says like you know

capital is the city of marvels and you

guys can it there may not be a job for a

little while but you guys can find ways

to hone your skills don't like all yeah

that's right we have a lot of fun in

account so that's there they're pretty

they're pretty the having to be on the

ship is kind of weird they're not super

happy about that because it's

like an alien squid ship but it's

someone like that bad school word an

alien spaceship so that's it you guys

level up - so - shoes was like sir does

that mean that we're still gonna try and

kill Morton yes that's javis job and me

take does the chain fulfill its

contracts sir yes it does there is some

treasure on the ship that if you guys go

and look in eventually somebody will

find if you guys haven't already we'll

go check out Xerox quarters and that's

where this thing hey monkeys a pretty

strong it's just so there's a king and

there's a lot of the junior officers or

human and they can just attack magic

normally but definitely boots and King

can tell which VIPs in here is magic

there's another thirteen hundred and

eighty-seven gold in here that's not

that's that's party treasure that

doesn't go in the Treasury the

Treasuries for when you guys get paid

out for a contract so the Treasury the

Treasury guy only goes up when you guys

get like a huge payout like we

completely contracting about ten

thousand

otherwise when you does just get lead

from normal adventuring that gets

distributed among you guys like okay

like you were normal adventuring man but

there's a sword that seems to be magical

there is a really really nice mandolin

that is apparently magical the creature

had a medallion on him that stayed on

him even after it was dead dying and

it's magical and there was a pearl I

might take a mandolin lessons no point

in the Pearl is a pearl of power does

not shouldn't surprise anybody the

medallion is a medallion of thoughts it

has three charges while wearing it you

can use in action and expend one charge

to cast the detect thoughts the DC of 13

then how is able to use charged chain

Stein yeah well I think you have you

have your your guitars are good have

some psychic abilities so certainly

depending on the nature of this creature

is anybody when it died it didn't reveal

its true form it just turned into an

amalgam of mush so whatever it was

depending on its abilities that's pretty

good if you ask somebody a question and

and you and you knew an answer you were

expecting someone with the tech thoughts

could probably occur read the answer

from your head right so if you were

waiting for a specific answer maybe it's

possible but this thing was on the ship

for three days right like three days

it's long especially good tech nice

right you can learn a lot in three days

yeah what was the other thing Pirlo

power it's for you being a third level

spell slot by the way this is this is

magic so I realized I realize that

there's not a bard and you guys have a

mandolin there's magic my harmonica

biron magic Oh

so it's 9 o'clock you guys have leveled

up and it's time for us to take a break

so we are going to stop streaming for

tonight

my friends are going to take a bio break

and probably level up and then we will

come back and keep recording and upload

of what we do next week that way they

still have some content left for next

week so next week I think they're gonna

arrive in capital and I'm gonna go on

vacation so until then thanks for

watching and putting up with this

nonsense and we will see you folks next

week

[Music]
