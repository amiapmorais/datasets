Yoshii

alright we're back oh hi everybody Matt

Koval here welcome to the show here my

friends and I were all video game

actually just say game developers yeah

that's right all game developers sit

around and play Dungeons & Dragons for

about an hour and a half and then we

take a break and then we play for an

hour and a half or until I freaked out

because they've gotten farther than I

imagined do we don't do announcements or

anything before we start though we don't

we normally just can do it okay rollin

no when last we left our heroes it's

been three weeks thank you very much

bill for running in my absence

you're very welcome it was enjoyed

myself well we yeah I can tell you

having a good time and we had a blast I

mean and so yeah I think I think in fact

I think some of these people are looking

are wishing we could go back to Val and

guard but they're stuck playing leech

I mean their character we saw some

people in the discord like I like bills

game better that's one of the reasons I

won't have other people running is so

that people could see there's lots of

different ways to do this yeah what

where do we leave our yet Tom I'll come

back from North Norwegian way no away a

question how do we begin eek Rhetor then

you did really well yeah so so one of

you [ __ ] is gonna explain what

happened last night what happened what

was the last thing happen in this game

well we wrecked the how many times did

you die once okay anyone that go away

with the wizard at least I snapped a

snake stick enough they win and they

snort the G snort just come back right

down a little bit there's a little bit

we need like an electric buzzer yeah

every time you snort comes out

a large sunny colorful man I'm try the

truck head smart Drive and then Nouri up

the eye

Dragonborn or the train paladin I see

tonight walked in and went oh you know

who you love and that's pretty much

where we left it I believe which would

it be like the last two minutes yeah we

wanted memory yeah it's a good thing you

didn't ask me I think you're wrong I

think my patron restored everyone's hit

points oh that's right that's why I

think you're a [ __ ] not but not your

spell's I did all this both mass exactly

so yeah you guys are a full Elf for a

Fidel Fiamma full Elf yep in less than

if you're a half-elf

in which case you're in half elf and but

your spell's and other nonsense are are

we sure rest no I don't think before the

black iron pact correct winning to the

dragon boom coming actually you're good

because he sat down and rested while we

went around and started looking at like

they were [ __ ] around I don't think

the rest has happened because the I

think you rested before and black iron

pact but then the dragon war paladin

interrupted you rest I don't think the

rest finished I wouldn't hit the short

rest button if it didn't rest and I did

I mean all my powers looking set I'm

looking to I know it's been three weeks

I'm looking to chat in the hopes that a

mod or someone will remember can remove

this ambiguity specifically dr. Brassell

MD thank you for the gifted stuff dr.

battle dr. basil here's not basil it

could be basil he's though it could be

basil basil fool t it could be never be

Colin vessel yeah no I didn't know I

believe so yeah there so I guess no

short rest did you guys all right they

rested G home says they rested for three

weeks

I got 15 specialist:yeah know what it is

my distinct it was certainly my intent

that you guys not gonna short rest in

because that would be contrary to my

chat seems to think they rested so oh so

as I said you guys rested and you power

to whatever nonsense you get back from a

short rest hmm yes once pills uh I'm

gonna use my troll power to get a

third-level spell slot back Wow

but carry P says that she did not note

one in the recap she usually does yeah

Oh what oh so wasn't drunk cuz it's

Carrie who got me this thing I put my

hip points back to max by Stuart yes

spell slots cross that yeah I don't

think it's [ __ ] wasn't [ __ ] for like

ever

cuz I remember the whole thing where

Bodie said oh this is where the thing

came from in like 20 like you guys were

expecting you guys the session began or

like the previous session had ended with

you guys inspecting the giant crystal

and trying to figure out what was going

on with it and you saw the molten gold

and all that stuff happened to before

the fight with the black iron back no

I'm talking about the crystal in the

room yeah I am too no that's the only

crystal honey giant diamond is the giant

diamond in the room okay once we don't

ever I don't want you to have a rest but

I'm actually what I want is to abide by

whatever I said last I'm gonna go pull

up a bit I know this okay we're to stop

we will barter a short rest for three

more weeks of building it wouldn't be

this wishy-washy a filler by the screen

you could just say one way together

all's I know is it all my powers are

reset yes I must have pressed the short

rest button and I wouldn't have done

that just willy-nilly so let's see what

happens with the Dragonborn cuz baby

will get a short rest opportunity right

after cuz he's gonna kill us and fight

us we'll kill him first

yeah actually actually Anna is smarter

than me yeah because it actually doesn't

matter if you guys gonna show a rest or

not because I don't think anything's

gonna happen that's gonna require the

Slayers I think I use my I said the

quiet part loud in a lot of bark why

just make this like real initiative like

randomly like no but a dragon a dragon

born paladin does come in yeah or at

least a knight I can't tell what their

class is and they are carrying a shield

naughty dragon a chain of Acheron she

shakes her head the last of the hilt

whispers legendary murmurs high

companies persuasion Shack ooh

[Music]

eighteen I saw your old yeah it's true

we have much to talk about

I do not recognize your authority as

Knights but I may be being hasty I do

not know as a story however there is one

left some were in this war and there was

one left

hiding it cannot escape let's go get her

mmm well we should probably make her

aware that a wizard one teleported out

yeah she'd snap is the one that's

missing

did she a spellcaster because one from

this room a god bother her I deem much

like you a wizard let's steal his words

that's not your words go with that it is

your game Matthew Koval no nay not a

wizard she says now that was everything

I slew the wizard oh he killed the

wizard yes

all right loser got bother there he lay

so who's left she's like super

interested in these bodies but it's just

it's distracting mm-hmm

I don't notice this last one then the

one that disappeared she killed him yes

how many of those are how many of them

are there he where where were you

fighting this group here is this room in

this right yes but we were just here

this was hours ago oh oh where have you

been since then recovering mm-hmm are

any the ones dead in here the ones that

you fought she's like turning over the

BOD like kicking the bodies I'm kind of

pushing them over with her heel to try

to look at their faces and there was one

that she has to kind of like trot over

to the corner and pick the head up no

she's like no these are a different

group okay these are the ones they sent

after they knew what the first group

found

did you break the first group on your

own yes now she doesn't say yes she says

I killed all birds one one escaped one

went through the door one I slew with my

own hands when she says door worship

range she's pointing to the the crystal

no the one that's still sealed correct

yeah correct

so one of them went through this door

yes a sealed by through the door do you

know how yes

now she bore ring not a black iron ring

another ring a talisman and she held it

before the door and muttered and the

door opened hmm damn where's the body of

the one you slay I do not know I thought

it might be one of these hmm do you know

if any way that we could get through

that door and make chase

I do not know how the witch did it

mm-hmm should we check the bodies to see

if they have anything on them that might

help us we can plunder your uh your

kills after we sort this out and she's

gonna like stomp off and go look for the

one escaped let's do this favorite thing

in split the party I need some graph

paper

I don't you need a small thing no thanks

she's going in the room you're in she's

going so there's gonna be a little bit

of a retcon huh since the last I don't

think I've given you guys like a map of

what you've explored I mean yeah there

may be a map of weed I was exploring I

don't know that is an old map I know I

have a new map okay new more accurate

and the the layout is primarily the same

the difference is that the rooms here

are now all round the rooms are all

around yes thank you it's what you do

zion.t hold it son already drawn this

out

yeah well Phil would have printed it out

[Music]

to be fair he would have had somebody

else print it out for come on it's true

yes he told the city of Parker do it

yeah good Steven Parker do it oh yeah

he's the only one access to that printer

already yeah buddies yeah you don't just

anybody that access to that actually I'm

gonna be super picky about this I might

be I don't think we have any way of

getting through this door if we don't

have it's still red gold right that

right that if I'm in Raleigh it is yeah

whatever yes open it melted away yes the

door into this room had the

rooms and like melted gold on the floor

yes and there's a second door he's gonna

bet someone got through with the ring

just imagine that a person who could

draw drew this will have let's go up it

and do that um like a Arcana check on

the door because the doors obviously

magical in some way or another so butts

can probably figure it out yeah we need

to recruit a senior officer wizard well

you could just all you had to do is let

one of these [ __ ] stayed in the

character this is terrible anyway like

so I think couples should go with her

couple sons for like me she doesn't know

yeah we'll leave you here with Tom Ian

leach and copper may be the things that

we yeah I would say that should probably

know yes shows no to each other you're

not bad you're you two were you two are

bad but they said it's two humans and a

bunch of [ __ ] monsters well so she's

not so full of us yes that's the Ramones

I should show her the little psionic

crystal that I have maybe it's a piece

of her hide sorry

well let's see so this is and me will go

with her I'll give copper the bag of

holding loot it up mm-hmm this is where

you guys came in there's more there's

more tunnels in schönau your action oh

that's what like the ladder is to get

yeah yeah why don't we came down to say

the letters here yeah we got it

transient this is like I'm done here and

then there's this wide arcing corridor

that goes around here you guys came in

through here there was door their

doorways here in here

open so this door is open but then I

think this door is closed and this is

the giant crystal and this is the door

these guys thank you the one that they

said that she went through yeah

and so she's just going out like this

way she's like like this okay I don't

know if she as she's walking out she's

like I'm not a mercenary what are you so

you guys are you guys gonna split a

party that sounds awesome

no so have you guys gonna stay here and

loot the room investigation the other

half we're gonna follow this crazy this

crazy person thing I don't see any way

we're getting through this door

why do we wow there's the ruins Russell

so I guess that one you wanted to drag

in you want to loot them and see if they

have the amulets recession about so we

can use them to get through but alex

cumulate does she

I'm sorry I miss we you said I misheard

it tried to leave okay so you said the

black iron pack use the amulets to get

through know anything about anything

well I mean maybe you're on talisman

palace that was no ring Oh ring yeah

well they'll be wearing it they did say

a talisman but she's a a ring I don't

know tells I doubt these people actually

have it remember the note that we found

that was like use the third W to get to

the door it'll time right well as men

[Laughter]

that's definitely okay their wings okay

we're in windmill standby as I consult

my notes yeah so she exits to the

smaller adjacent room and then you can

see her in you can see her in was the

you can see here here and she's like

looking around actually let me erase the

door

[Music]

this one kind of thingy on there and I

missed the portable hole what do you

know purple hole for Lonnie body storage

[Applause]

what do you just draw bodies for this is

like the default for Lars Mikey this is

where we already looted these guys yeah

yeah I have all the treasure for them

you haven't gotten oh we have said you

were gonna do that

no yeah watch that episode tomorrow yeah

well I mean cuz I know

slim took trophies correct he took the

the tattoos from the master Jack holes

and non buncher yeah they have loot all

right so he's going after the dragon

bull which of us I'd like to follow this

just a lot of demands that's just a

second for tonight any information to

find out who she is

yeah okay she works for and where she's

going and if we run into this you know

one that got away full take them out so

yeah there's not actually I apologize

the process of translating what happen

to the other is somewhat disoriented me

pretty typically this door is open

there's not the door here so she comes

out and she goes this hallway all right

and I will I will follow you have big

cat oh we do we know where you are

I got rescue or something so okay who

else is going with this crazy this

driven obsessed tonight

do you you know is the only two she like

like do you want to come with us

sure I guess who's the mondo I think he

wants to see what kind of goodies EES

faster well then stay here

and loot the bodies well but I mean so

let's captain you're in charge loot the

bodies we're gonna try to delay children

so all right so you see boots and I'm in

charge very good catch back up slim is

suddenly fulsome in his power fine come

on do you make as well yeah cuz from

your point of view he's the new guy all

of a sudden like higher command leaves

the room barren so those of you who are

staying behind to loot the bodies yes

you get all this cool treasure you guys

are through the process of elimination

it's difficult or have you guys left yes

and you guys stayed yes you guys how can

you tell if something's magical can't

okay well why assuming that's something

I gave you the bag of holding some

[ __ ] we'll sort it out later smell it

later yeah and butts is with you guys

actually human how do you know

did you tell me oh she's also a wizard

right that's true yeah she doesn't

identify right yeah I mean I think that

if she had if she were a full PC she

certainly would so this is one of those

scenarios where the rules for retainers

are designed to make it really easy to

easy and simple to run but I sort of

expand

narrative lis to grant them the kind of

abilities they would have if they were

using the rules from players at the

retainer rules are just to make

bookkeeping easier they are not a means

by which we describe literally

everything the character so it is

reasonable to be in the scenario that

butts would probably able to identify

with at least the tech magic and tell

what the hell's what

there's a guy robbing loot I hope when

you got no three of them more all right

there's a magic breastplate the breath

there's magic breath but but there was a

magic breastplate I'm coming charge oh

yeah I could delegate yeah you guys yeah

you're not there yes plate there's magic

leather there's a magic rapier and they

are all black eye they're all black

they're all black eye I'm interested in

that breastplate right I'm interested

right yeah

does judge have identify yes

Lucia thanks not the breaker breastplate

and iron well I have by the way a

completely reworked how your character

words all right but I have not in fact I

think I'm largely waiting for bark are

to gather some playtesters to test it

because I think that I got to I can

point test it

the text is ready the text is ready to

be played but I have but don't worry

about it since I haven't deployed it all

right there's a vial full of oil silvery

silvery oil there's a potion of what

looks almost like embalming fluid

there's a scroll with a spell on one of

them is wearing a ring that is ornate

and has a blue gemstone set into it that

is that bears every sign of having been

made in alloy it does yes so yeah

there's breastplate there have leather

there's a ring as a rapier there's some

flask of oil as a potion and there's a

scroll

on it a silvery oil yeah oil of

slipperiness or I'm sure it cost I

didn't get to taste it I will use

identify that one is identifying that

ring it's it's known among the denizens

of quintessence as a ring of air science

heiress I am correct it functions as a

ring of air elemental command but you

know yeah it does man I know I know it's

that I can summon an air element we're

right but they didn't like yeah you can

them you can't summon an elemental but

if there was one around you could tell

what to do mmm-hmm and if you kill an

air out look at you look it up and it's

yeah bringing up air science yeah no

bring a look up ring of air elemental

Commandant's green look up bring of

elemental command incoming four

different flavors you can probably guess

what they are earth air fire cheese and

meringue elemental plane of cheeseburger

legendary okay it does identify only

work on one item do you think when I am

at time yeah well I want stinking cloud

to identify this breast page I don't

think fine I guess books and they

weren't spell oh you use that an offense

I did I wanted to like I found the ring

and I was just like you want to know

what yep it's this one magical item a

magic imbued creature or object I learn

its properties how to use in spills I

would have yeah I will say and this is

yeah I don't my my expectation is that

there are certainly items the casting

identify on does not reveal everything

that's fine so even though the spell

says hey you learn what it does there

are a spell there are items that are

much more powerful than the spell

identifies

equipped to deal with this is this true

well we're in this ring you have

advantage on attack rolls against

elementals from the linked plane and if

it's for quintessence does that mean

anything from quintesson the linked

plane is the plane the elemental plane

of air

like the wind Dukes of akka there's from

the elemental clean air yeah yeah yeah

Jerry quite cleverly is referencing an

akan leave the items on the ground and

see if your pet will step on them and

that's how you know if they're Kirsten I

would never I would never put you a

cursed item in front of you people what

kind of deal would do that wait a minute

on your neck yep the Rings then I got

the Rings cursed I don't know I think

they're cursed but their fingers cost

familiar oh you're still alive

lucky enough the great commander brought

me back to life zombies starts pulling

on your ears I'm like yes yep no Odie

I'm alive that's correct

and then Odie Odie I'm here come here

you can evolve out of the silver stuff

for one taste of the silver stuff uh-huh

he appears to disappear okay he doesn't

just point out the way like people cast

it physically does he kind of like

becomes progressively more transparent

until you can't see him anymore and then

he goes and comes back like hey any luck

I think actually in the in the dams guy

that says you can just tell the potions

and Scrolls dude I don't think you're

after castmates area you know I think it

just says you can identify them by like

yeah by it's by I like having ID have a

taste of all mean yeah I do as as an

innovator nethack player and an

old-school D&D player I do like the idea

that you have to do some experimentation

I might bring out the other valve the

buddy embalming fluid stuff I've d-o-d

taste it uh-huh it tastes it

[Music]

[Music]

[Laughter]

and as a scroll the scroll you can so do

you mean photo why do you ask

yeah the scroll is a school of circle of

death blimey

and so we think that to think the

embalming fluid was like a truth serum

no thoughts sorry I think roof well you

already know the stuffs magic and I'm

kind of that's good yeah and there's I

can't think of any reason why you

wouldn't as soon as you can just

identify this stuff mm-hmm and I don't

think it's gonna make a difference at

this point the breastplate is a

breastplate plus one oh it's a plus one

leather it's opposed to the and keep in

mind all of this like the the leather

you know the links holding it together

and the way it's embossed is all has the

black iron packs and it has it on the

breastplate is black iron breastplates

it's the same stuff the ring is made of

but it doesn't have any symbols on it I

don't think it does I'm not sure what

kind of I'm not sure what kind of

iconography would be on if it were I

don't think it does the you know you

have you basically know what the oil and

potion is you know if the scroll is the

regular ring is the rapier is it's

called dancer dancer oh it's a plus-two

rapier if two of your attacks against

one creature hit on one turn you get an

extra attachment the same target Wow

[Music]

yeah you know then but it's cursed Oh

what I'm worth but what's breath in it

maybe okay you probably can turn this

great well you could desecrate something

and then in the name oh yes let me

desecrate just means ruin and so you

could you could consecrate a temple to

as much how do i if I wanted to

consecrate that rapier oh I see

how do I do that they're like so

consecrate and desecrate our term well

that's a good that's a good question how

would you make it like how would you

make it an unholy rapier as which you

want to do I think there's actually a

spell called consecrate desecrate there

used to be but it's not permanent so

they're probably some rituals you

display some rituals originally you'd

have to perform some ingredients you

would need and some thyme and then if

you cast the spell wit and do the ritual

and have the ingredients then you could

you could desecrate this weapon but

generally speaking desecration and

consecration are things you do to altars

and temples places right it's a prop

it's a process of defacing the

iconography of whatever God a given room

is devoted to and then festooning it

with the symbology of your own God

that's doon yeah yeah festoons there was

a spell called ceremony in zanaffar sky

oh I guess ceremonies and judge and

Leitz are now married sure that ceremony

coming-of-age oh nice have you a real

boy married

but says super interested in the door

good ok I'm gonna have a roller wanna

check go for it ok that's w17 ok let's

explode they also is there it's like 14

ki 14 pages of notes so I realize those

you're watching this may be somewhat

tedious I don't blame you

Jake bacon says cut to two weeks from

now boots has always been an evil bark

so this door this is a massive metal

door that has runes in it and also these

strange geometric channels running

through it that are now empty and there

is a pool of gold at the bottom of it

and surrounding the door in a

semicircular pattern is a frieze it's a

it's a series of carved figures

depicting a story and it's there's one

arc going around the door like this and

then there are two smaller arcs that

inscribe around the door and those two

smaller works have words written in them

and buts is in the process of trying to

figure out what all this symbology means

I can recall over yes all over leach

efficient as that leech can read

anything just as I think this is ancient

I think this is this could be a she

wouldn't say neo modern but she this

could be middle Caelian but I think it's

old Caelian and I I don't

allow me I will look I'm reading it okay

well I can tell you what it says but I'm

not going to I'm gonna write it down

don't say the first word

loud for the last one this is because

that's difficult to read that's one of

those times around wa2 relax

[Music]

boots and I are out there just saying

ma'am over and over this is amazing

I [ __ ] love you guys split the party

for this guy Zuma

here's my favorite about 50/50 on the

sincerity about state no no sure either

I'm sure it's sincere but not you know

maybe to our detriment

yeah well I think there's a microphone

in coffee yes definitely the louder the

better tell me there's there's the

metagame attitude which is never

supposed to party right but I don't like

that I think I think it's cooler if

knowing or suspecting that people are

gonna get in trouble there's gonna be

danger anyway it's still cool to say our

characters don't know that we know that

but our characters don't know that solo

you guys do this and we'll do this and

that makes pair so the first sentence

mr. Driscoll have you readiness in

Hebrew why you always do I read it yeah

sex system I can't be she brew I don't

the first sound that first sentence is

written forward the second sentence is

written backwards so it takes you a

second to understand what the heck is

going on and there is a an explosion and

both butts and leech are curled across

the room one in six chance of death six

chance they survived

one two three it's butts four five six

it's leach I rolled a five as far as I

can tell they should use maybe I should

use the black dice which means can tell

use you tonight

just flies backwards and skitters across

the floor kind of on on her butt and

leech slams into the giant diamond and

leech takes seven points of slamming

enemy and make them dead okay okay yeah

I remember great so uh she leads you

folks this way and there is another

silver door it's like this one okay

right and it is closed but then she

pauses in front of the door and says are

you ready to fight it must already is

I'm gonna get there is no time to rest

she opens the door

let us see what foul creatures dwell

within this is this where the one that

escaped went she doesn't know it's just

she's just kind of randomly you really

around opening random doors and rings

well yes

this was a terrible let's hear this yeah

what sort of monomaniacal hyper-focused

keep mind she's also like [ __ ] yeah yeah

like she's so why don't we rest a moment

so we can heal you can I try to stop her

from opening the door um sure yeah can I

see if I can just like just like grab

the door handle and be like you know you

guys like it a minute so like figure out

what the [ __ ] is going on toppers like

ma'am if you rest we can heal your

wounds

are you ready to fight do you seem a bit

I am scrambling right now I'm a knight

of the falling star yeah I mean dude it

looks like you're trying to become a

corpse of the falling star like did you

come down a lowered yes alone yes same

reservation do you know what's on this

door I know that somewhere within this

complex is another member of the black

iron pack and if they escape and I will

be shamed right you saw them go through

the door in that other chamber we were

just in yes that Doris I yes she still

has her hand on them yeah I do

and she's like yes yes it was I who

closed the door hmm

okay what if what if he went through it

why did you close it not fall on through

or them whoever I was guided by Saint

Isabella I do not know I do not know I

cannot put words to the feeling except

that I knew the door must be closed and

I acted and in my haste the other

escaped and in st. Isabella telling

telling you that it went this way or are

you just running around yes she says

just like that okay don't think I need

to make an inside check and it was so

like you're over here probably because

you're grabbing her so she's got her

she's got her hand on the thing and she

says let go my hand or it is battle

between us as you wish sure blizzard are

you asleep

I've got like yeah not hypnotic pattern

let's let her go in see what's in this

room if it's fucked-up stuff hypnotic

pattern all of her problems are solved

we can go back in and she opens the she

opens the door and she's like ah and

pulls our sword out inside the room it's

a circular room so no there's another

circular room right so it's okay

and a zero past this one there might be

Jerry is giving me more paper than I

need so how do you how do you do this

without just constantly getting along

for your own notes I was so excited for

tonight but I just sort of grossly over

prepared you so now I've got like

probably three or four oh yeah oh yeah I

only print out what I'm gonna use I

expect you'll use that night I was smart

yeah

so there is a circular room about 30

feet circa 30 feet around and there is

another door beyond it and the walls of

this room look like marble and it's got

the glitters the walls the floor the

ceiling are all made out of this

glittering marble okay and there is a

glyph in the center of the room and at

the glyph is a light it's it's it's

glowing mm-hmm and at the edges of the

glyph it's strange geometrical pattern

but all the edges of it there's like a

wall of light that rises up to the

ceiling and all shimmers with the same

prismatic glow that you see she's Slim's

sword when he uses a psionic crystal

mm-hmm and beyond this transparent

prismatic wall there is a woman standing

there facing the door and she

has a black iron ring mm-hmm

kill her is this your escapee sir night

lady lady night I have been a man but

not in this instance

[Music]

says it may be yes this is our quarry

but the same this this this woman this

human woman is staying there and she's

also been in battle

her face is bruised or her armor or I

think I'm not just wearing armor she's

wearing like noblemen it's outfit is

torn but otherwise she seems well

composed and somewhat wary hmm and then

Dragonborn night runs in this is our

quarry she shouts we've packed up this

far I mean yeah uh okay old person on

the black iron packed person

what what what magic do you have on you

wait where you have you cast your cast

whole person you don't go in the room I

haven't gone in yet right we can see her

from where we are Kent yeah absolutely

can yeah okay go ahead and mark off the

spell nothing happens yeah the

Dragonborn night the gemstone dragon

board night runs in and swings our sword

in hacks at the prismatic wall and her

sword it bounces off and worth it it

visibly physically hurts her just it's

like it's like she slammed her sword

against

and that feeling of like taking like a a

bat like a aluminum bat and swing as

hard as you can into something and into

something movable like a man it just

completely like like what like a mailbox

I wouldn't know but you know something

something a movable and the shock just

kind of throws her back and there's a

there's a spark of prismatic energy like

little tiny crystals flying off of it

but otherwise the barrier is is is

unchanged and when the night recovers

you know and she has to kind of like she

hacks at it again and she's just gonna

continue to bash with this thing and

nothing happens ma'am your tack isn't

working maybe we should calm down we

should approach this have to think is

that how Kings isn't that's a large I

don't remember something to that effect

Lady Knights stand back ladies her

Knight I'm gonna try something she stops

it's not clear if she's stopping cuz of

what you said or she's just exhausting

herself yeah exactly yeah but she stops

alright and you can see the woman behind

the prison look for the semi-transparent

prismatic wall it's looking at the from

the knight to you I don't like all right

I'm gonna say to the the night you know

ready ready an attack just in case this

works like you know save your energy and

I will cast dispel magic from the

mandolin okay on the on the wall on the

prismatic wall where are you where are

you where are you where you standing

still outside the door if like no if so

if if the room is a circle with the wall

dividing it down the middle

yeah if the knight is at the wall I'm

basically halfway between the knight and

the door so here's where you guys are

yep right and you and worry you so if

there's well there's prismatic ball is

like right in the center

yeah

I'm like I'm like inside the door I'm

basically like like standing behind and

aside the night what what items are you

do you have Oh

what magic do you have all kinds of [ __ ]

well I got I've got Skippy O's family

short sort right yeah I've got this

mandolin I've got the boots

oh you cast the spell from the mandolin

yes so when you go to play the mandolin

normally the things you play with the

mandolin sound amazing right yeah now

it's just a mandolin no mmm like you

can't like like you can definitely hear

the difference between it's the same

you've heard them play this tune before

but now it's just plink plonk plink

plink vs. for quick yeah it's like the

difference between an electric guitar

and like now it's suddenly an acoustic

guitar mm-hmm like suddenly it's not

it's cool it's great

correct yes

anything else on your anything else

magic you got on you well I've got that

crossbow

yeah that's not magic that's just clever

oh and there's the boots I I did take

one of those rings well which one of the

black iron ring yeah like but it's not

on a finger you guys found one ring that

was not on a finger yeah does it who has

that one did you

I don't think it's me oh yeah I have the

ones I have are all on a fit have a

finger in them I have one that I thought

I that I like prized off of their

eluting finger well I don't know if you

noticed this or not but the eyes on the

moon cats boots clothes when you walk in

there okay like some kind of hand

probably I probably have not noticed

that King might notice

all right so it's a prismatic wall we

can see the wall yeah shimmering its

shimmering and it's it's it's it's light

it's made of light it illuminates it

casts a like a rainbow shall we left

just Turkish peepers still in my earlier

region candy well I mean 90% of it was

awesome yeah calmly on vacation Norway

his homeland he brought back a ton of

awesome delicious candy and some Turkish

Pinot yes anyway anyway yeah so you see

like it cast this rainbow shadow across

the stone across the marble of the floor

and it like changes the colors change

like the they shift and move but they

don't stop you from seeing inside I'm

going to step directly behind the night

right okay so that the light from the

wall okay isn't hitting me yeah

and I'll try and play the mandolin

that'll be in the show no all right I'm

gonna go back to the butcher shop

we're about to get [ __ ] robots yeah

the the woman behind of the prismatic

wall

what like raises one eyebrow and says

perhaps I can negotiate with you and the

dragon for tonight says now attacks the

wall again yeah so she's not really in a

talking mood but I mean I'm always down

for a chat if you like I think you're

the last one left

I'm the last she says I'm the last one

here clay suspect I'm not the last one

left

hmm I mean we'll consider that a minor

technicality the time being is this is

this wall you're doing or did you get

stuck in here a ladder I'm afraid huh I

mean this is like classic you know I

don't know where you guys have been but

we've been in Asheville see we've been

to quintessence I mean you know you you

learn these type of things but you never

just walk right into a room with a cliff

on the floor like that's you know that's

one on one that's really basic stuff she

looks down at the glyph on the floor and

says it was not eliminated thus while I

entered she can't do this she she what

fair enough rookie mistake perhaps

there's some phrase which could be made

for my freedom yeah yeah I think I mean

I'm a mercenary so ah

she says excellent and the dragon looks

at you and says I know it and it spits

on the ground I mean hi I figured that'd

be her - she's black on her back she

works for Ajax things may not be what

they seem

she says - King come in she says you in

the hall let me see your face ma'am

making demands well she hasn't made a

demand yet she puts the hit her hand up

against the wall and it kind of you see

it kind of glow around her fingertips

and she presses

I might have I may have information will

be of great value to you depending on

who your employer's to see how is she

wearing black iron gear as well yeah

she's got the gears got the ring he's

the one that that the night saw go

through that second door in the main

chamber yep hmm I'm gonna I'm gonna walk

a step closer in and touch the wall yeah

same thing happens to you that like it's

because you see there's no looks like it

but it feels like uh like it's glass

okay it feels solid just firm yeah okay

yeah but it does you see that it's

almost like you're touching one of those

like plasma balls mm-hmm right around

your finger that's what that's what it

looks like and and she's so now you're

standing like this far away from her

yeah okay try to sort through this one

who do you who you work for

she says who pays pays you are you d'lai

hey wait you can't we need a lot is that

just use that you know change sign you

can see you here King goat you turn

around I'm not just gonna like you know

I'm thinking of how of how boots would

answer this question yeah yeah of course

you could come into the room I'm not

getting baited by her [ __ ] that I know

who you are

but what what King do not go deal with a

[ __ ] person who works for Ajax yeah

Ajax killed my boy appearances can be

deceiving what in this context could you

possibly mean by that

you're the chain of macaron she says yes

I recognize your livery not the entire

chain no but one of them I've read the

broadsheets the chain needs allies yeah

but if you read the broadsheets you also

know that we're not exactly on allies

type of terms what does not once what

does boots mean by that you work for

Ajax yeah who told you that she says and

[Laughter]

you killed a bunch of our men just yell

that through the room there's no blood

on my hands she says there's blood on

the black iron packs hands

well we found your bars I'm not mine

roll my eyes into the back of my skull I

mean I see no reason like is it this and

she does something that you haven't seen

somebody do before which is she takes

the ring off and tosses on the ground

and casts it bump bumps against the

against the prismatic Wow hmm puzzling

and she shows that her finger is not

appearances can be deceiving do you know

how to get out of here she asks because

if you do not actually she doesn't say

do you know how she says you have the

means to bring this wall down because if

you don't then we have nothing to speak

about and I may be trapped here forever

yeah about that I mean even if we don't

were her best bet for getting out of

there so there's no reason first how can

you write

I'm trying to think I've got let's like

we're gonna tip my brain I'm like what

okay

what are you guys over last week when

bag had some crazy reaction to something

you know we were all like I was like

what does that mean hmm can we move

those cameras yeah I don't know I think

we're about to go get to eat some

Norwegian chocolate I'm stumped no sir

it's it I was looking at ceremony in it

does nothing for me as nothing about

consecration yeah you can wait out

unmarry yourself we only go married in

there used to be a spell called

consecrate / desecrate it might be a

higher level thing I see right I don't

know if there is a fifth edition but the

nice thing about fifth edition is that

obscure spells on previous editions with

one exception typically still work

normally you're easily easy to translate

[Music]

[Music]

so let's say we can ask her why she take

the ring off just a man per question

Matt hallo chat says how is it uh-oh

hello chat oh oh oh I learn next level

or have access to it next level I feel

like that's just an illusion like I feel

like this prismatic wall thing is

probably her doing as well

slim copper big cat leech and judge do

me a favor put your character is that

that's us oh no the other goods Thank

You Georgie the door that we opened is

the one over on there that's right so

the doors but the door button leach were

reading is here I know I got thrown back

on and you got thrown here that's got

tossed all it's actually a little bigger

than this at 70 feet across I mean there

coach I do not have how would you like

to be appropriately sized Mint has an

hour has not or fine in that empty space

to the left there's no over here yeah

yeah I know but you could grab it that's

the closest thing you got circles was it

well yeah we've been I said I think

probably the time who take him to model

in 3d print a mini would be greater than

the time he spent on this don't ask that

nah he's a professional I can't work for

you guys this is this is dope ass man

this is dope I thought it was this so

that's something I just la me what's

that mini where did that come from last

time that he pulled out Jason has

brought but Jason's brought some of his

where I'm remain he's in but the fantasy

ones not the sci-fi was so we don't have

his if he brought more you know what

fell at bride's cat or minis in

what would you what is it a robot yeah

it's basically a robot correct like IP

don't know it's not bipedal but the real

or a robot would be better than no robot

I got you a Gundam yeah perfect oh my

god okay

yeah bender

obvious on the battery Green Ranger

alright so we roll initiative it is oh

yeah his initiative that we're do right

now it's a different ways of king and

[Music]

get some Thai judgment slim 20 which 15

and if you want our DS it was 11 can we

not just have OD go in your turn do you

care I don't care no we were doing that

no no that's just what it says in the

rules first we weren't we were doing I

do my turn yeah someone I think in chat

was like and yeah but it's it for me for

me your followers should always hear

when you go otherwise huge Bentley

that's like I didn't then I do be the

same that's how I do it just at the same

time yeah the OD goes when you go

alright it's like 15 uh copper Oh Wyman

new choice for dexterity I presume it's

not twenty link used X is I think so

it's this person and then

this person and then Kubrick and then

judge stop judge George Oh slim there's

a giant robot here it looks like a it

looks like a it's literally the picture

I showed you guys this next kind of my

goes it's a we looks like a wheel and

there's a there's this glowing mechanism

in the center and reading at the spokes

radiating out from the center our

robotic hands that are all grabbing and

like pulling like like a perpetual

motion machine and pulling the wheel

there's no it doesn't have a face or

anything like that

and yeah it arrives on the scene

and and when it when it teleported in it

says this effect cannot be uncaused

[Music]

effect you cannot uncaused I and I were

seen anything like this make a are count

check six no no I mean it might be you

vaguely familiar to you in a sense

because you're from the astral see

mmm-hmm it's some kind of like [ __ ]

cop cop yeah like a police well yeah

like some sort of guardian or enforcer

and I like the the like not yeah I mean

yeah if you it's it's it's on the tip of

your tongue you're a hero there was some

you knew at some point you had some

lifetime of experience and read all

these you're just having a really hard

time accessing it because it competes

with all the other lifetimes of stuff

you've accumulated in the past we'll see

alright so but yeah its limbs its limbs

action well I assume I mean its

aggressive I I think slim is going to

assume based

what it says and I assume its movements

and stuff back it up that it's attacking

so yeah I mean it's gonna attack so I

will swim I will attack first that's

copper and big copper rose next to last

and King is not there boots is not there

and it's worth bleep where's my leech

and man have you just never made one of

these no she didn't make your own but

they didn't have to make their own but

these but you work here

fair enough that's good solid and I like

a leech goes at some point so are you

fountain all right Long Beach goes at

some point get me out get me up there

okay close to him so I can I don't know

welcome God have a head no you can't we

cannot verbalize

2128 see 21 hits okay what's that

doesn't mean you feel as soon as when

you get so from where you're standing

definitely but as soon as you've got for

like here mm-hmm

as soon as you cross like this line

basically mhm you calm down you you you

definitely feel like there's an edge

that you didn't even realize you had

that you relied on mm-hmm it's gone and

it's definitely like the presence of

this thing is doing something makes you

kind of like need some caffeine or some

[ __ ] anyway

tired I wouldn't say tired exactly no

not really

there was a like I said it was like an

edge go it's gone now well fees oh he

didn't realize like this is Blackman

normal probably how like normal people

feel we're only people aren't exhausted

and

like I'm not a normal person no and but

that's kind of anyway I don't know if

it's like a police if he's trying to

calm the nothing to see here

oh the forbearance what did that say I

mean technically you wouldn't know you

so a threat and a lot of teen damage for

the first time thank you Matt a Driscoll

you know second attack and would you

know that you speak it aloud I just read

it 26:26 it's another 15 damage nice

wrong number

[Music]

I'm not using any of my superiority dice

yet I want to see what this guy's

capable Willie trombone says its

alignment is lawful awful you know

what's favorite food is falafel waffles

and waffles of gobbles lawful are you

done is that you around I am done it

goes no time oh this is time

it's a clock what if we kill giant clock

rolling supposes clock I soon yeah we

heard you it glows for a second and you

see it go boost and it spins in a circle

in in place and now it's like vibrating

pants not gonna hit you

uh-oh sanic yes I did it did it when I

when I hit it did it seem like it did

anything oh yeah I definitely liked it

it's like you fought constructs before

and it's not fun cuz it's kind of that

thing you saw with the knight slamming

her sword and it's not fun

but verbal sword does a pretty good job

cutting through even solid objects and

so you're definitely making you're

making all the progress you would expect

me okay yeah is it facing me when you

say getting when it doesn't have a so

it's a it's a wheel right now is it no

no it's it's yes absolutely pointed

right at you I'll get out of my opinon

in case it's blonde enough actually now

I'm gonna send out Dee next I'm gonna I

don't wanna be run over there

I think I'm curious of will cuz I go in

a straight line okay so I'm gonna go I'm

gonna come over here next now you've

completely [ __ ] off and then I'm gonna

do I get voltage because I'm asking ID

for help right these using the help

action because of my guy sure I got

volleys right I guess I thought I can't

attack is that how the help action works

I think it does does it he uses his

action and grants you advantage yeah

it's that straightforward I believe so

yeah yeah I haven't looked it up and I

trust you okay I know I know you have

looked it up yeah I think that's I just

use I'm used used to it helping being

doesn't I've not used it much on my coax

he's a design initiatives I like to get

into help so are you up I think he's

definitely able to distract it which

means that unable to concentrate on

defending itself against you yeah got it

that's how it works I take what do you

dress plus no I'll get you your own 18

yeah sorry yes 18 plus 9 yeah you

definitely thought you know what I'm

plainly for weeks a comment do I have to

roll on each yeah hand did I look nice I

T don't want my mother won both side i T

so and then what if you get one be ten

plus four on each of those so that's a

nine so that one does 13 and that one

does seven so 20 yeah yeah your your

your so you notice now that your

eldritch blast when you fire it it looks

a little different than you do it's not

got the celestial golden glow to it it's

now it seems as though it is streaked

with sapphire copper and that sounds

good yes sounds good also did it hurt

did it look like it did anything I mean

it wasn't cuz it kinda move these for

these feet yeah they're making it uh

actually like where its feet actually

show you where it is no perfect so it's

in those squares so you are five and you

are you are still within fifteen feet oh

yeah so from where your static when you

get up yeah you notice that like even

though there's this crazy battle coming

on you don't feel like the same rush of

adrenaline you would normally you're not

tired no no you don't feel like you're

falling asleep there's definitely this

edge that you normally have when there's

a fight that you don't feel like you

have right now I thought it'd look

glance out Daisy acting a bit different

isn't no I realize it's as usual yeah

it's not really doing it I'm done that

was leeches kaprun yeah I'll do uh do

hunters also within 15 feet of us

upgrades I'm done judge uh leech Ryu is

this like the space say he takes up this

to four squares yeah where his feet are

okay so we tree I'm actually oh yeah I

think you're one forward well limits

limbs right yes yes ma'am

okay does this mean I get advanced cuz

Odie's over there or no is that slim get

the don't

uh no ma'am I know yeah I would say what

you both do probably actually I think he

would have to technically be standing

like right here to give judge advantage

but I think I think it works I think if

you draw a line from from Odie's Square

to judges Square and if any of those

lines goes through this guy's space then

it counts so I think I think he's

grinding both you advantage okay that

case I'm gonna go ahead and I think

that's the actual rule but regardless

Ernie is my photo section 2 doesn't work

I can't miss you know you have that

feeling that feeling of like yeah I

don't see miss I see normally when I'm

fighting the adrenaline makes us so you

can do all this crazy [ __ ] you can take

an action you can take you can take a

move action you can take a bonus action

but when you try to use your finest

action okay it doesn't matter what

they're yeah 20 way it seems seems like

a knot it seems like a lot but not when

they're rolling 18 16 on the first

attack damage so that's gonna be another

18 to roll another 18 mm-hmm well you're

gonna bandage though right I did that's

why well then almost 15 so 3 plus 4 is 7

7 plus 6 is 13 you break the curse like

it's 22 yeah you guys I want to play

with us in your game I want you all to

be rolling like we did how much

I think 36 total know how much damage

did you just do on top of the sixth

point is 16 and then into 20 mm-hmm is

it 20 damage but a seal Oh swing it away

because it's like a type of unconsumed

seals I do 3d six plus seven cuz it's a

plus two sword yes I all my ones that I

roll is twos cuz I'm working that's true

your other weapon master once I did on

the first attack that's cool it's a

twenty damage even after that I write

coal um Chrissy has thank our rolling

good wants a milk bank what other damage

you do magical what about don't have any

anti magic stuff these guys don't these

guys don't have any in fact of anything

yeah I know I know I know other things

about him to make them easier to fight

hey you guys don't know yet

so yes okay you did a bunch of damage to

him um so is it that I just I can't take

a bonus action right okay you also

there's no mechanical way you would know

this but if you're the effect of the law

of time is that enemies within 15 feet

of this creature cannot take bonus

actions or reactions or reaction was

okay

that's right I was a little worried

about it you're basically it's basically

it has some aura that is forcing you to

behave like normal creatures fouls that

cause spells that typically only think

I've blown a section to cast can i

instead cast those as an action yes okay

you do the same thing there seal

you could you could you could use your

action to put a seal on them but that

one to your action

okay so I'm gonna try I'm gonna use my

movement to back up I don't have the

ability to disengage I'm using a bonus

section that I can use I'm gonna back up

and see

I can get back about yeah we're going to

retreat and provoke an attack to

opportunity yes okay there's like a

15-foot it's a 15 foot radius 15 if

you're 50 if you're 20 feet away from

you're not affected is your AC 15 it is

not at 16 well I don't like you all

right oh yeah yeah it tries to it tries

to it tries to slam into you press the

slamming do does work misses so you're

free I'm free

oh my far enough back great done we're

not to be no or yes you're not anywhere

you you feel you feel the normal the

normal everyday edge the adrenalin edge

that you get in combat come back to you

[Music]

and then it goes again it's time uh

ticket eat up and uh judge you did a lot

of damage to it uh-huh I think you

probably did more damage to it than

slimmed it so it is going to I mean if

you did a shitload of damage to its eye

in copper I guess well they can't does

do you still get an advantage actually

might attacker opportunity is a reaction

you guys do you ever get the attack so

yeah these two truck into the judge

which are mastered 16 mm-hmm okay so it

needs to work eight and it gets three

tickets and now that's closely I can't

use reactions huh correct

you take 2008 the damage from the first

attack whoa will be ill 11 points of

damage

from the second attack yes you may 20

and 11

mm-hmm he it's hard it hits hard and it

unlike you it gets a bonus action that

it uses to make one more slam attack

what again 18 were damaged and okay and

it is married a now it is done well so

it's gonna get another he says you go

again

that's cheeky mm-hmm are you guys not

interdimensional time warriors go on go

on slim okay big guns there it is a 37

but we could continue what well I was

thinking like I thought that would be a

dramatic place to stop when it goes

poopins well yes let's trivia um so I

think the whole thing that judge wanted

to do is he saw this like crazy ass

machine come out of here okay it's like

just probably knows that this is some

kind of ward right like this is some

kind of like um well it's obvious that

it's protecting something

yes it's protecting something and so I

and I can't remember what the warning

was that the Sun Oh said to us about the

fact that like the seals have been

broken or the whatever has been broken

and blah blah and so I think judge would

have wanted to try and like this thing

to spoke right in a way that they

understand right this judge would have

wanted to um

in fact on its turn when it goes it

speaks again and it says the

must be obeyed mm-hmm so we forgot about

butts

no buts the past out okay she's

terrified

oh yeah

she's been she's been detonated yeah and

she's like the sandbag in smash bros

she's cool

see you later yes she's like that thing

in that game yes okay fine

[Laughter]

but yeah I think I think Jojo judge is

gonna make an attempt to say like you

know we were sent like you know we're

sent here by like the Sapphire order or

the Sapphire sky they're called to to

reclaim and protect the wards of the

Emperor the other seals have been broken

or something to that effect to

illustrate the fact that like other

Ward's are no longer safe and that like

and that's why there is better there

with a purpose to protect awards

essentially so you invoke the name of

the Sapphire sky yeah you invoke the

Emperor and the wards of the Emperor

what what's what skill are you trying to

use to I think I think well he's only

gonna use intimidate cuz it's doing it

yeah cuz it's gonna be more like a like

a stop I stop what you're doing like

we're here to help kind of thing like

you know like we're not a show of power

yeah like I'm an ill rigger listened you

must listen to me here by the authority

of like the Sapphire sky or whatever

guys called yeah okay go ahead and make

a roll something like this unfortunately

would take an extraordinary success no

it says it responds to though I says nil

nice I notice yep do you speak turf Alec

I don't I don't well then you don't know

can you

yeah if you're right that there might be

so he won't speak for Connick this is

speaking truck I don't know if did he

speak for Connick no well then

when somebody speaks like Spanish I know

like yeah buddy we're speaking Italian

would you know if they were like can you

tell the difference means I own Heights

very difficult sometimes my difference

between somebody's speaking Italian

somebody speaking Spanish if you're not

from that part of the world one sounds

logged over maybe so it's not a language

you speak if it's out it might maybe it

reminds you of Taconic in which case

maybe it is Ducati judge doesn't know so

how do you guys man so we normally try

to rap it take a break around 8:30 but I

thought it was a cool stopping point

when time the inexorable of time

revealed that it gets to go twice or it

can go twice Perona know if it's gonna

do that every round you have to have to

watch and find out and so we're gonna go

take a break about 13 minutes and come

back and wrap this combat up and then

join boots and king and the and the man

and the gemstone Dragonborn night as I

try to negotiate with someone who

appears to be a member of the draft this

is the point which we hang out with you

folks for a little while because we

figure if you were still watching after

the last 90 minutes that you are

definitely a true fan and so this is

when we do announcements it's Kayla

masses birthday happy birthday Cal

Matthew is one of them supporters and we

have puppies somebody wears the nails

many oh it's on the table outside while

he's giving nails Minnie we were gonna

look at the fan art that we receive

turns into a slide

sends it to Jerry and Jerry turns it

into a slide show and that is this

that's happening now no scrim

I swear well that one does look so

demonic Cody baby yeah it's really cool

man that's really cool I like that then

PC is apply next next faster from

strongholds and powers this is ash

Marshall from one of the members of the

court of Arcadia from the glowing sort

of super cool Justin sherry has fan art

we're just insurance art has banner oh

oh there's the people and the things

they summoners King and the temple are

dust and then there's no victim and yeah

that belief counts as a fan art yeah

it's giant can you put one of the Omega

nails on Maxie oh yeah you Jerry can get

a shot a ascended form he's tall and

wearing aviators twitting spells like a

boss in the cosmic US House this came

from Adam so thank you so we wrote a

quite nice note for all of us which I

read

thank you very much Adam and let's see

is there anything else it's a real quick

for the fan are the best way for us to

see it for it to get into slideshows and

stuff is to put it on Twitter with that

you train fan art hashtag and or put it

in the discord so like for example we

found that one on Instagram and it's

super great but we saw it you know weeks

late mm-hmm

so if you're doing awesome fan aren't

you should put it there yeah Lars lives

on Twitter social media that's the Lars

is the fan art Wrangler also I am going

to be playing Dungeons and Dragons this

Saturday night we're gonna host the

stream here so you can either tune in to

this channel or I think it's uh I don't

know if it's me hosted on the watsi

channel but it's with I will be playing

with some other people I don't know who

the other players are I think I think

Matt Mercer is one of them I think this

is I think the first opportunity Matt

and I have

ever had we've known each other now for

like five or six years the first time

we've ever had to play D&D at both as

players together and the Dungeon Master

is going to be my friend Luke bag axe

whose event it is as the founders and

official the official Finals founders

and legends because they could not fit

founders and legends and Matt go on

there yeah it's basically Gary Gygax day

at celebrating Gary's birth and then

Luke is just really cool I've hung out

with Luke twice now and he's just a very

straight up dude and so when he invited

me I said sure yeah absolutely

so yeah twitch TV slash Gary Cohn

because it's basically Gary it was here

in LA

it is a Carrie con production and so

yeah I'm gonna get to like like Luke was

texting me today saying which of these

characters do you want to play and I was

like I don't they all sound great

monthly whatever one is left over so we

will see what happens Saturday night I

think the whole stream of the stream

starts like noon yeah noon to 10:00 p.m.

and I believe my bit starts at or around

its 7 o'clock so I'm super looking

forward to it it's gonna be a blast I

think uh anyway so boots and King oh

yeah there's a there's a mysterious

mysterious woman in the regalia of the

black iron fact who has taken off a ring

and thrown it on the ground and there is

a seething with anger and and also

righteousness gemstone paladin of the

falling star yeah okay so first of all

who are you and why why are you why why

do you feel like we can help you are you

it's like are you a member of the black

iron pact as it would appear the

gemstone dragon like puts herself

between you and or cheek and she grabs

you by the shoulder and says do not

speak to this woman she is an enemy she

will be guiley as she will lie

I mean I know she pushes you away if you

would have suggested that I talked to

her so did she

oh no it was the other way around yeah

anyway

close enough calm down for a second let

me you know why just keep chopping away

at the wall here who's your she's an in

anger at your that you're baiting she's

she's her sword and and takes a step

back and watches to see what happened

what transpires between the two of you

and the woman behind the prismatic wall

says why don't you invite your friend

him uh because appearances can be

deceiving

maybe that's not my friend I see you're

a friend of your commander I mean you

know it's a little column a little

column B do you do you have there's no

point in using a lot of questions for

being the one who's trapped behind this

wall yes well let's see my prerogative

and you've answered none of my questions

very well asked who are you you may call

me Valencia De Aza no Valencia de Lozano

violent violent violent violent eeeh hmm

ways like her name is violence vile

India all right do I make a make history

shot

nope yep never name before

and are you or are you not a part of the

black eye impact I am less a member of

the black iron pact than you are a

member of the chain and why is that I've

answered your first question answer

question of mine

do you have the means to escape the cell

if I did see I'm dude she's doing

answered questions of questions ha how's

it feel if I were able to take this wall

down what's to stop this crazed

Dragonborn paladin from cutting you to

pieces immediately uh she can only do

that if I grant her to that power as an

attempt to preserve my disguise and I am

not inclined to do so okay and how do

you know that the three of us aren't

just gonna all jump you at the same time

we may try any reason to trust us I do

not advise it mmm

anyway to your second question what was

it repeated pleas you asked her

something and then she said well you I

asked you a question you asked my right

um no uh I asked ya who she was

oh um oh my god are you part of the

chain my parameters she said she's

threatened she's less of a part of the

black iron pack than you are a part of

the chain and then you asked a question

about what does that mean yeah what's

your deal you took the ring off like are

you or are you not an agent today Jax

I'm not an agent of a Jax what are you

what are you doing here in ring well you

mentioned a disguise is your disguise

this black iron get up yes okay

I may ask

I may ask you have perhaps more

sensitive question you may yeah I am at

your disposal you have all the power

what are you a little knowledge is a

dangerous thing

she says mm-hmm but suffice it to say

that I am one whose enemies are your

enemies in almost always interesting so

I take it she says and she kind of goes

that you do not have the capacity to

free me it doesn't it doesn't seem so to

me well then as pleasant as this

conversation has been I'm afraid that it

must remain an all-too-brief

and she turns around and then like sits

down with her back to the far side of

the cage uh and she waves to the knight

who's like anyway so it's a slim Stern

wife just walking you wouldnt have to

remember if you just would walk into the

room yeah whatever quickly safe room

yeah in which nothing bad cos we had Oh

prism dimensions and then she walks free

and goes ha ha ha and then goes and zaps

them she was all along so I'm gonna use

my first action through trying to

activate the psionic crystal and and do

the thing that I like to do

yeah you can't you only get sold amplify

yep your sword

it is believed in prismatic power and

then I'm going to use my my uh where's

it at

action surge unless but Thrones and hurt

down yeah it's a nineteen plus eat 19

min wait nineteen plus a role the

nineteen yeah could you do me a favor

could you I got three like a for no

visible eighteen eighteen fifteen

nineteen let's go John

man just [ __ ] alright that's a lot

of dice you had me make a history check

with advantage I rolled freakin six

[Music]

okay so first attack 23 damage 23 I uh

and then dot okay alright second okay

hang on a minute

you used an action to turn on your sort

your your prismatic thing right and then

I use my action search to do another

action right okay the action search

isn't a bonus action it's just like a

thing you can do all right

every class you can take an additional

action on your turn this can be used one

times per short rest I got two attacks

in my attack 16 plus 8 hits I'm going to

do a distracting strike on it add

another v8 so the next person to hit it

we get advantage the next person to try

to hit you from a distance yes sweet

oh yeah

[Music]

oh I have fireball I mean ant icon it

bits of it are falling off not good it's

definitely in a bubbly it starts like it

has the appearance of like internal

gyroscopes that are winding down okay

that's all I got

okay so let's see ty so I'm gonna check

it whether or not it's I get to take

another turn ability recharges and check

to see whether or not it's speed up so

it just it just it just turns and slams

into slim slim 18 so it needs 10 1940

leach I'd if I cure wounds I was gonna

do it it's made it try to skip you OB up

near the time thingy OD knowledge please

not leach there you go so he gets his

advantage and then less they're actually

should I step back a little bit so you

have it yeah I'm gonna step back a

little bit this is what Dean he needs

needs [ __ ] Gundams

it's range and then I'll get varnished

because was it +9 on that side 1313

misses and that's the seven plus nine

four sixteen sixteen mrs. bauford my

Eldridge boss miss pathetically then

thank God I thought you had it been yeah

you had advantage for you

oh that was your first roll Yeah right

what's that I know I know 18 nope that's

it

sapphire infusions bolts just go flying

randomly around the room cry out

something absolutely you can then I cry

out the word said the cycle must be

broken the cycle cannot be broken like

that uh okay I'll do

oh this is Ulta Bozek okay cool uh you

don't have LMS right now no oh here

because there's a giant diamond and I

mean like 12 feet tall blocking your way

and you are a short little goblin a also

you're not in a square what are you

doing uh well yeah that's fine

you are now within 15 feet of his

nonsense

okay now you're outside 15 I'll use my

bonus action for healing spirit I'll

cast a spell on judge so you get one be

six so if yous stay there every turn

you'll get a 1 d6 I can also move it

it's like a bonus bonus action there is

a limit to that though right

and it's a given number dice equal to

your level that's a limit I imposed yeah

yeah yeah because otherwise it's I

thought that was outside of combat

I think this period well light so you

could deal 186 now and then so you could

do that probably seven times and then it

goes away

yeah it's like 186 per let's do really

good so you can still do 1 d6 now and

you could stay in a spot so what I was

gonna I'll just I guess we don't really

know because I'm gonna say we can

awesome so I couldn't no I can't cuz I

use it as a bone in action never mind ok

so now he's gonna attack you know my 1

d6 now yeah yeah and then I could move

it as a bonus action to your spot again

and then it should was getting like keep

healing okay

Everly used in combat okay that's like

19 plus 11 does that hit ya missed it by

14 damage 17 plus 11 the hits 15 damage

can come and then and then 5 on top of

that which is yeah and then I'll tack

with big cat come through the door like

the door open and it came through or did

it like yeah 18 plus 6 hit yes for 10 11

12 damage it's you guys have done over

200 points of damage to it is dead yeah

well it does it what it does is it it

appears to like fly apart like it's been

the the mechanisms keeping it together

start to fail and the pieces all start

to fly apart but as they do that it also

kind of goes

and it it does what he did when you kind

of taste that little thing is the flying

piece is all kind of like almost like a

wind blows them mm well into into into

disappearance you're free to make

whatever conclusion was so good where

the door was where I was reading the

whatever it was the cycle must be broken

what's there is it something I'm gonna

go over there

okay butts butts comes to fourth the

time runs out you use up the rest of the

healing spirit yes

six more d6 is again yeah we all guys

stand ask the judge you can divide up

that those days everyone but there's

only Sonny a tiny but yeah how much do

you owe no I mean it time you six two

sixes so the elincia I would buy is

sitting at the end the the Dragonborn

paladin it's pacing like the dark smell

like a caged animal except on the wrong

side of the cage what I don't know what

that means

use your words we're swap pepper we're

gonna do okay all right so first

proceeding gesticulating wildly towards

via so I walk out I walk I walking out

just out the doorway

Ragna and yell so do have I ever read

anything in the Chronicle about

prismatic barriers like this it's any of

that familiar to me that's a good

question this sorry there's a at least

one thing

no not that you can think oh not the top

your head maybe if you like sat with the

Chronicle and part over it for hours

me my polo the you might be able to

learn something it is a notoriously rich

source of obscure war well I mean I've

been looking at for at least an hour oh

I boot someone talk to her I don't think

it's been an hour they've been like I've

always kind of asked like the same

question a time so well commander I

actually okay hear me out on this an

agent of Ajax right if they're trapped

and you ask them if they're an agent at

Ajax and they think they can get out of

it they're gonna say no right mm-hmm but

like this if I ask you if your god say

yes yeah this creatures being super

weird I don't think it's a human I don't

think they I think it might genuinely be

stuck and like yeah it had every

opportunity if this would trap to spring

it and it doesn't seem to care at all

that it's if we bring this wall down and

the three of us try to jump it at once

it's trying to get all of us in the room

at the same time though yes which is why

we want to swap okay

by night the night approaches you after

having been frustrated yes she walks she

walks up to the amp it says I think it

wants to get all three of us in the room

you know oh you know what I think you

might be on to something we should not

allow this to happen there's a ruse a

trick hmm Kim you should see if you can

find out who sent this this whatever

this is

so you said you think she's a god bother

your words she turns and gestures some

sort of priests priests of Saint Ajax

something

and mental note for next time

number my pages okay so hey I know in

what order they go

I only print out the ones you need well

I mean you guys I don't know how much

you guys gonna get done tonight you guys

could explore any number of different

things yeah you have a lot of branches

on a lot of decisions as far as

directions left and right and back and

up and down uh so how about you let me

go talk to her

priest a priest and I'll see what you

can get um and if she tries to escape

Briggs you you said you think she's a

priest and you said priest a priest yes

oh oh my pocket meet zoo negara you're a

guard say oh you're a guard and priests

yes of course yes I don't know why

you've done that anyway well I don't

know what that prismatic barrier is I

know that yeah does anybody know why

does a man why would anybody know that

though she's she's like very well I will

accompany you she doesn't look pleased

to priest that I think that all kind of

went just do you think she's really

gonna talk in your presence when she

knows she want you want to and I shall

talk she'll talk when we get her out of

that barrier and then you can get her

but we need to get her out of that

barrier first well how do you propose to

do that or sex that's what I'm inclined

to figure out well deal hey uh what was

your name my name is for my friends for

my friends you can call me boots do use

boots do you know what do you know what

that you may call me night okay night do

you know oh you're not giving me a name

I mean no you don't give her name either

let me know all right it's easy for

somebody who's been in the chain for 10

years yeah but that's not your name

yeah anything like that before she's

like down the hallway I got it yeah

yes I have it so what about that sure

all the 13 in an 1800 and I was an

eighth okay I said what about that and

point to the prismatic barrier is that

familiar to you have you seen that in

here before but actually she'll make an

art can attract she's not skilled in it

yeah some sort of psionic wall and when

you fought this so-called priests in

battle did she use any psionic powers no

no that is some sort of manifestation of

whatever this place is so you do believe

that she's trapped and this isn't a ruse

I do not believe she is trapped I

believe that she is using that barrier

to defend herself because she knows I

would cut her down where she stands

otherwise

she looks that's I will see her bleed

you know she got through that door

none of the other black iron packed guys

that showed up well no my she didn't get

through the door so whoever got through

the door is gone oh I thought this was

the one who got the good no this is the

one who escaped correct like there's so

two people have escaped one person

escaped from this night one person

escaped from you guys right and then

someone else made it through the door oh

wait made it through the on the door

that does not open that's the one that

the and the night closes behind it um

different door is that the one we were

looking at yeah the one you were looking

at that has the words around it there's

also this these figures car anyway

actually not anyway yeah there are these

figures carved onto this door so there

are words going in one direction words

going in another direction and around

that yeah are these is this almost like

a like a you know Egyptian hieroglyphs

that tell like a story going around from

left to right

likewise I'll be back in outfit I mean

that's what the door I'm describing is

oh well yeah for the night is it telling

we can recognize the aura glyphic well

there there are figures they're not a

language

right face okay I see what yes yeah so

you're gonna go up to the door yeah the

bloody door again so yeah the the

figures they're very finely carved and

by which I mean not expensively in this

instance but they're very small so the

story that goes from the floor across to

the other floor is a long one and it's

going to take a while of study because

it's very weird and unnatural to look at

it and it is like sequential art right

that you're watching almost like comic

book panels hmm but it depicts figures

that appear to be wearing the garb that

you associate with King when he's

but he's not his when every king wants

to dress up he puts on formal Hegar and

garb okay it looks it looks like a very

old version of that a lot with dozens of

figures and they're building and working

and you see over over time as you follow

it they are creating wonders and

buildings and there is great empire

being built actually no it's the other

way around I'm sorry that that is on

there but that's like part two part one

our figures that look like if there are

any sort of commands in the chain there

must be they appear to they're up there

bald right and they're wearing what look

like Egyptian more Indian more Indian

like ancient Indian mm-hmm outfits and

they're doing the same thing do you see

them farmers agriculture and then

buildings and then great towers and then

what appear to be wizards and sorcerers

conjuring great works and then other

shape that I wrote my notes that I might

have to go fine it's like though that's

the point which arise yeah this nation

well yeah if you keep looking part three

are people that look like Marcela Scipio

people that look like Roman centurions

and stuff and all three all three stages

all kind of show the same story which is

this this civilization growing out of

the out of the dirt basically farmers

building something remarkable and don't

know why

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

Wow let's grab it oh I love ya

yep yep

and then what you see in in each of

these in each of these storied

depictions you see people worshiping

something in the case of the first

Empire they appear to be worshiping a

burning pyre okay right meaning there's

that there's a figure looks like a mummy

was a figure wrapped in cloth on a pile

of SIA is burning and these people are

worshipping it okay and then there is

like chaos after that as what appeared

to be painted barbarians destroy

everything the these people have built

and then the next Empire and this is

this is the one that looks like long as

his ancestors right do the same thing

except in their case there's the the

cult that grows toward the end is

they're worshipping what looks like a

grave a gravestone and a grave and

there's a figure under the earth there's

a figure buried that they are

worshipping and then these these uh you

know

Conan looking [ __ ] that I have

these crazy tattoos all the time you

guys start killing all the people look

like lorises ancestors and their

buildings are on fire and then the then

the K then this this is quite obviously

the caelian Empire you guys have seen a

lot of their ruins around and this is

the Roman Empire and all the same things

happen except this time the cultists are

worshipping a mausoleum this the it's

stone the stone Romanesque building and

there's a figure a shadowy figure inside

it and then there is instead of the

third ones different instead

these tattooed Conan looking

[ __ ] is killing all the Kayleigh

ins and tearing down their civilization

there is this symbol that looks not

entirely unlike the map with the Rings

huh ring well hmm

because this is the tomb of a tomb of

the Emperor no you're not there - is the

I was playing - the spectral ring

world's never been described as the tomb

of the Emperor is the place or the

Emperor locked away the kind of the

greatest discoveries the most little his

wards are each considered some powerful

either artifact or knowledge that he he

locked away so they already prevent them

from falling into the hands of

barbarians

could it be might it be safe to assume

that in this story the the items that he

locked away were the things that saved

him from the third from barbarians

coming and wrecking there are no

barbarians depicted in the band an act

of this frieze that's what I was

thinking yeah wouldn't that barbaric

grace yeah he doesn't know what those

things are no I do wonder about the

mausoleum though cuz that I think for a

judge judge might correlate that with

like the undead district and Capitol

there is there is like a whole city of

undead inside Capitol yeah yeah yeah and

then there are words written in der

könig

okay in two lines when going this way

and then this one's going backwards

which is a little bit more difficult to

write and as leach discovered the outer

circle says the cycle must be broken the

inner one reads the cycle cannot be

broken own effective let us cycle there

that depicted right Emma cycle if we

build up a Empire at night outside I get

killed

yes place

that's the cycle right but then Liebig

get broken well there's always cultist

there's the risk cultists in both

previous ones as well right I was the

cycle in this case owner if it's good to

dream like Ajax is the next cult that is

collecting the cycles once they were

worshiping something dead first they

were worshiping a burning mummy then

they were worshiping something under the

ground and then this and the third one

they're worshiping a shadowy figure in a

mausoleum mm-hmm

but then for whatever reason the barbary

the last one is the ring well yeah maybe

it's indicating what the different wards

are in some way maybe the words are

ancient and each one is tied back to one

of these prior civilizations or

something like that I don't know what

else is body's so where the time clock

whatever it was birthed out this room

can you walk back to the room I mean are

we done with oh we're not done

blizzard lady's not gonna leave her

alone so um we you actually said we need

we were supposed to catch up with you

yeah I just want to walk in well part of

loot the bodies and meet back up with us

I mean you guys have been gone actually

like we're probably a little bit out of

sync right now I think what you guys

have done in here is taking longer than

what these guys have done so far um but

the door is not open right the door is

still right there's not like a pool of

like what to call down like molten the

cold the gold the gold is still inlaid

within the door

correct the molten gold is the gold on

the LED in here ya know the-the-the seal

here it appears to still be intact and

there is about five feet off the ground

there is a hole in the door like it's in

like like it was made to have a hole in

the door yeah and it's yeah it's like

baseball sized or softball sized

[Music]

softballs like put your fist in there in

there yeah I've begun od going looking

go go go don't any going a bit further

does it go anywhere it looks in sticks

his head his eyes yeah is this still in

cylindrical hole is tube that goes you

know about two feet in and the outer

part of the hole has all these little

like nodules and channels it's like a

key or something yeah and we haven't

seen Adrienne looks like it might fit in

there I mean I've seen something within

their monster wait where did the wedding

time appear from the door Mike he just

exploded because it was amazing is so

good I think we triggered it and I think

it came from a plane that it normally is

a song but it got cold in some way and

then came to this plane so what's going

on with you guys are you gonna are you

gonna talk to her priest Oh a priest oh

yeah I'm gonna go talk to the priest I'm

gonna talk very loudly you're going to

hang here and listen I'm gonna see if I

can get more information out of her are

you giving me orders no but she's not

going to talk with you there

she knows you want to kill her I'm the

only way we're gonna get information

from her is if we communicate with her

if I get my cell phone she'll talk yeah

because there's a prismatic wall brace

it back yes ah very well very well she

says I yield and she sits down it's it's

okay and what is your name what do I

call you book

they call me King yeah you yeah I pull

the crown out

paper I got from the Pharaohs dream they

ever she leans back against she's just

sitting on the floor like a kid Brad

likes flunked and she closes her eyes

and means my head back and says I am

lady or Rosa var of the falling star and

this is my luck why were you sent here

sent sent I'm not an errand girl I'm a

knight why are you in ring well why is

the blind eye witness ring well oh this

place yes is that what you call it

yes I was investigating the black car in

fact no I was following I didn't know

who they were I overheard people in

church talking about a hunting which I

did not believe noises in cellars and so

I waited and watched what was that so

you just follow them down here not this

is yes I mean to be fair that's how we

found it too so and what is your

business with these she knows our way

into it are you supposed to be talking

to somebody we're here to prevent that

the Emperor's words from falling into

the black iron pact and therefore Ajax's

hands there's no Emperor

kaeleen Empire fell thousand years ago

what are you talking about what you

babbling about big man you don't

understand the words they're coming on

my [ __ ] like you're using terminology

that is that is not known to her okay so

the caelian empire did you fell

thousands of years ago eight thousand

years ago yes give or take a few hundred

years I can give her like the short

version if you want to

yeah go for it yeah okay I'm just gonna

just say like briefly just be like we're

working for the good guys and you know

we're here to protect important holy

stuff down here the good guys we're

fighting for the fate of the world blue

tang I mean like even if you invoke the

sapphire sky she doesn't know what that

it's not there the Sapphire sky

incredibly obscure secret organization

but we can talk about the black iron

pact what they've done they've attacked

us and they're our enemies and we're

stopping them from stealing the things

from this tomb I mean she it's gonna be

tough to get her to trust you just

because you look like mercenaries you'd

sort of act like Daenerys well but they

don't know who the Sapphire sky is so

that doesn't impress her and she's just

you know she's gonna assume that you

guys are like rat catchers basically

because everything you're saying is what

a rat catcher would say no were the good

guys we're trying to stop the evildoers

we just happen to enjoy it just a

coincidence that we looted their bodies

and to call their [ __ ] we want this

stuff you know they attacked us so yeah

it's gonna be it's not gonna be easy to

get her trust but she is she's so

exhausted now she's alright because

she's being a little bit more

forthcoming what are you gonna what are

you gonna just uh just be prepared for

battle if this uh I'm a knight of the

falling star I'm always battle I'll sit

down next to her and play my song song

of rest she leans her head back against

the wall and closes her eyes and doesn't

complain cool alright olive branch

mm-hmm I go talk to the the other Karen

in the room yell India okay okay so you

walk you walk into the room so what what

what magic stuff King

have a plus-one sword and I have a

plus-one show uh-huh

anything else Pirlo powers been used for

the day and my eye on stone has also

been used the eye on stone yeah the one

that gives Matt resistance once until it

works it's used in the last battle that

spells so the iron stone the way it

works is it floats around your it yeah

and when it's charged and able to work

it looks like a gemstone when it's spent

and done working it still floats around

your head it just looks like a rock it

loses its its gem like luster and when

you walk into the room the Isles don't

those falls on the ground I pick it up

and put it in my pocket satchel also

that's that kind of ozone smell that you

just live with all the time now because

you always have magic on you around you

goes away and you didn't even know you

had gotten so used to it that you're not

used to the air not being do a test I

cast light uh-huh mark off the spell

light is they can trip now that happens

okay just to clarify all right so this

elated react to me I mean not to you

coming in all right well I'm here to

talk ma'am has our relationship changed

in some manner that I'm not familiar

with well this is the first time we're

communicating so this is the start of

our relationship she stands up which is

a Zen do you have the means to dismantle

this prison cell where your fellow did

not I have the closest means that you're

going to find in this place it says that

sounds like a no I don't think we have

anything to talk about pity we'll see

you we're free Inc it's a new exploring

the place and find a means to remove you

from this curse whereas you are stuck in

here

and can sit here and I guess die that's

what you're willing to do yeah but like

I I would be surprised if the means to

extricate myself from this conundrum lay

within these walls but by all means

continue searching well there's plenty

other people with us who can maybe bring

these down this wall down perhaps why

are you here

well I ran wounded and I was hasty yeah

I mean before that I know what you hear

rookie mistake

[Music]

so looking at the glyph yeah can I infer

anything from that I guess Arcana check

yeah I probably can't use guidance great

10-plus probably nothing I mean it's

some kind of anti magic trap that much

you recognize okay

and you already tried to spell Matt well

you didn't try from outside the room but

magic doesn't work in the room oh yeah

oh that's right from outside the room I

mean you can but I already tried casting

a spell into the room I guess a strike

cast again on her and she's behind the

barrier indulge my curiosity what is

your interest in Ajax why is it you and

your color

there's no interested in whether or not

I'm on Ajax aside Ajax is not here Ajax

is not nearby at best a very distant

friend he killed our previous commander

our and my friend pity well you know

some people are winners and Ajax happens

to be one of them mm-hmm that's the

preferred nomenclature uh I'm kind of at

a loss for what to do with this lady she

doesn't really want to talk we don't

really have a means to do anything to

get her out is there anything else in

this room hmm

is there another door is there another

near on the walls there is another door

yeah there's another silver two door

similar to the one that um lady or Savar

opened yeah so we could probably open

that door well theoretically it's on the

it's on the round room the corridor

curves there's a door there's a round

room is a no door I mean we could try to

dispel it from outside but I think

should get the rest of the guys fear

it's if you can find the means to

release me then we can bargain until

then I think we're both wasting time

well I mean we can have some we have

some options we can fry but there's no

reason to do that if you're not showing

anything right yeah like what what does

she even have to offer like as far as we

know she's you know

smurfin if she could still have just

beat a member of black our impact who's

lying to us yeah like what what do we

get out of I'll do an inside check okay

to see if it seems like she's lying

about the if we have a way to get her

out she's willing to talk cuz I work I

mean what is Lars thing I don't know

insight know me what does Lawrence think

about what she's saying I mean I don't

have any reason to trust her I don't

like strangers

I mean she's not asking you to trust her

all she's saying is there's no point in

to sum up what she's saying is there was

no point in us asking each other

questions and trying to get answers out

of each other the only thing that

matters is can you get me out if that's

possible

well then maybe I'll start answering

your questions and I'll earn my way out

by telling his stuff you'd like to know

but I'm not gonna tell you stuff that

you'd like to know if there's literally

no way for you to get me out and as far

as you folks can tell there is not a way

for you to get me outta here so until

there is we have nothing to talk about

alright well I guess we go back to where

those guys are yeah see you later hmm

later Gator later a rose of our stay sir

okay we'll probably be back anyway what

was going on hope you folks doin your

check out the hole you're checking out

the hole yeah II was looking in then he

saw that no jewels and stuff yeah okay

it goes about this far huh huh and then

you just hit here I got filled up

whatever it was like no no what you

doing it just feels it feels you can

feel this the the details of these

strange channels and little bumps

I have no idea were you laughing about

loudly hm the little bumps move kids any

moving there I'm poking and prodding

around watch your strength ha [ __ ] me I

know I'm trying to move these things in

his says I'm too weak no no yeah leach

bleach pulls his hand out truck hmm I

assume that's where the talismans goes

but this door looks like the other one I

know this door is though the other ones

are this is huge the other ones are door

sighs OH melted whatever in front of it

it didn't look like this no this was

deeper in well actually I think we think

like know that this is the same as the

door that led into here yeah this door

the seal failed and the Sun I've got

this door the seal is still intact

well a seal meaning the magic that keeps

it shut so you guys have encountered two

types of doors you've encountered

aroond silver doors that are normal size

and you've encountered much larger doors

that have all sorts of crazy stiff stuff

in them you've been kind of two of those

one of those was open when you showed up

here and the gold had all flown out and

that's how you got into this room and

that's the room with Dimond and the

suneo so I mean I wonder if it's even

like would we even want to open that

door like if there was a Sun elf in this

one I think the what's words are in here

King as you guys are trying to puzzle

out what's one butts butts comes to and

he's like exhilarating yes King and

Boots come in without the Paladin we

need

we got it so good yes we got some weird

sonic barrier we'll try and figure out

one of the black iron pact is in there

maybe maybe black iron pact

I don't know she isn't very talkative

but you want me to well maybe

most likely yes but first of all I want

try to get some information out of her

and the only way we're gonna get

information is if we prove we have a way

to potentially get her out of there we

don't what says the first step in

avoiding a trap is knowing of its

existence and if it is a trap then it

didn't go off yeah that's great so

neither of us was pretty impressive so

she's gonna try and take over somebody

oh yeah check it out she's tried to get

us all in the room at the same time we

have although we have not fought a thing

I mean I feel like we just killed some

time in there too so you know a plus

guys like real time being chatting have

you sir I mean I wouldn't call it

chatting you notice that they have was

nice new rapier yes all right and these

leather may I uh

[Music]

are you wearing who's got it you know

have time to put this stuff on you yeah

yeah yeah are you gonna put on the black

iron packs armor it's tough because like

I don't want to [ __ ] if it has an

insignia on it it doesn't it doesn't

it's it's it doesn't but if you know the

black iron pact you know that's the

rumor

just because of how featureless and it's

not like normal iron doesn't look like

this it looks like carbonized yeah it's

got some crazy actually it doesn't look

entirely unlike this stuff right right

it's got this crazy it looks like it's

you know if you don't know watch our

impact it just looks like this black

driver big deal yeah but if you dude on

the black iron pad you're like that's

their [ __ ] armor

smooth featureless black do you have

detected an evil

[Music]

I'd say let's do some I'll just put in

the hood I'm putting the armor along

with all the other [ __ ] let me see that

real quick and there's also no there may

be something wrong with this it's a

black car in fact was wielding so embed

into your hand though hit the rings I'm

sure go ahead

I've got some hands alright so yeah I

had the right pair of boots you want you

could you grab those you hold it you

yeah as you put your hand into the

pommel the guard you hold yeah anyway

yeah you got this badass yeah hell yeah

all right so Z holding like a butter

knife you say where the dancer maybe

trick I ain't no dancer are you still

able to use her psyonix I mean I'm sigh

I

slim psychically in tuned but he doesn't

really have any psychic sure does hand

and that's yeah those are things you can

do you like you don't know yeah you

don't know magic yeah

you don't know magic just the power of

your mind is what allows you to do that

you are silent creature so you may be

the only one who can go in that room and

use those powers to make any kind of

change same thing with like you know the

crystal that you have like if it's a

psionic crystal versus a magical crystal

mm-hmm I might change to try it yeah I

mean that's that's all we got based on

experienced in there so is there

anything you want boats to do here in

this room before she goes I really want

her to check alright check that door

again just to do like any last things

that you kind of noticed maybe she

missed the first time um especially with

the key maybe kind of check she did that

she did before what was the result of

that because I don't think we I don't

think that Tina and what does it you

want to know I think I just want her she

says she doesn't shoot us I don't think

that whatever this is a cylinder the

thing you call the key it's finished

shape the key but I don't think the

cylinder turns this off I think this is

permanent I think the cylinder just lets

you go through it go through it yeah I

think if we could turn this if we could

activate this

don't open it would let us through but

unlike the other doors I think the magic

is permanent like if you close this door

again that's why that's she says that's

why I thought it might be you know turn

it off but she says I think it's the

read that person used a ring and

suppressed the magic and got through and

then and then the night did nothing

effectively then I closing the door

cause the magic come back because I

don't know what that I don't know what

that ring was I just I don't know but I

think all it does is it surprised I

think this is I think this magic is

permanent I don't think it can be

dispelled mmm you know I was talking

about that was it that no we found with

2 out of 3 double use and one of them at

the end said something about you can't

if it closes your people get back

through big guy Brendan on the nosey I

don't know you guys

yeah I know but who knows what I mean it

was like it was like once this once this

yeah if it closes behind you you're

after that person that went through

there ain't going back out so maybe we

don't care well I can't get out but

what's in there but sense what's in

what's behind the door million-year

sword where that is

yeah we don't have any way to get in

there I don't unless you can think how

do you want to well we may know someone

who knows how as a means no no knows how

the ring person got in there hmm

is she wearing any other rings except

for the Orang like are in fact one not

even worried that one anymore just took

it off you just wasn't attached to her

finger she's not back on planet yes

so she she says that she's not aligned

with she's her specific words were you

know she's no she's not as much a part

of the black iron pack as I am a part of

the chain I'm kind of Clinton I don't

know she's a mole of some kind perhaps

I'm kind of inclined to believe that

she's that she's not just a part of the

black iron pack it's yeah it seems like

she's a molar she's working for some

some other organization she won't say

who she's also said that her enemies are

our enemies right right yeah serious but

anyway you have psionic powers so she's

behind a psionic barrier let's go let's

see if we can make a deal okay

yes but says let's go come on stinking

clown does he know I'm I'm putz yeah

Isaac always thinking class well what am

i that time to think he's a thing and

it's just all of your clothes and you

just reek what I think

all right you guys head down you go back

out into the antechamber where there's

there's this is a large round room also

yeah make nah huh okay yeah there's like

four ways into this room there's a way

you just came through the way you came

in through the tunnels and then there's

the door that was ajar when you came in

kind of normal silver door that was ajar

and then there's a just a archway that

didn't have a door and that is the

direction these two through the archway

which your folks haven't been down

before and it's a curving corridor that

ends in a normal silver door has rooms

on it but those rings are dead and the

door is Danny open and there's a dragon

born gemstone Dragonborn night

resplendent in her emerald crystals kind

of sitting what they're kind of like

dozing slightly with her head against

the wall and there was a room beyond

that appears to be white marble walls

and floor which is very different from

the stone the kind of sandstone the you

guys are if our line blinds don't you

guys are familiar with sedimentary rock

you guys are familiar with and all

throughout that room before you enter

into you see there's these glinting

sparkling facets embedded in this is the

same room that's got the prismatic

circle and there's that there's a glyph

in the middle of the floor and the edge

of the glyph is radiating up this

prismatic wall looks exactly the same as

Slim's the energy that Rivas Slim's

sword and then kind of in the same pose

as the knight is sitting what appears to

be a human woman in black garb that

looks not entirely unlike the wizard

that teleported away but is not the same

character mm-hmm what did the wizard

that's not what do I look like uh like a

like a nobleman a noblewoman except

there a lot of her outfit was black okay

and this one looks

same same same kind of outfit same kind

of garb of the same class of person just

wearing a mostly black Wizards clothes

so these facets what's the deal with

them and they just sort of like I look

like almost like a little gemstones

mixed in not gemstones like mica we're

like little flakes of some kind of okay

okay yeah so like if I touch them

nothing happened I know you're gonna

touch them ya know then I'm gonna make a

perception shock or investor make an

investigation show you're you're

definitely investigating these things

okay reception 1414 they're they look

like stone it looked like it's like

marble and then little pieces of like

just regular stone okay

like not courts not gemstone just rock

okay I wanna go over and look at this

thing in the middle

the gift welcome um she stands up and

sort of like quiet creature I'm looking

at this this thing I'm gonna try and

like concentrate on it or just sort of

stare at it and see if I can sonically

do something I don't know I'm gonna

ready a whole person so it does come

down I should try something okay

[Music]

no concentrating it doesn't seem to

doing what it just feels like glass

where you touching your finger kind of

glows like they make a little glowing

spot this is the prismatic wall oh no

I'm talking about the the rune with the

boom coming up right there's a ring on

the floor okay carved into the floor

around the edges of that room there's a

prismatic wall and she said I got you I

got you and the prismatic wall looks

like the stuff that's reads my sword a

train it says it's a shimmering rainbow

energy that shift the color shift and

move look at even sheds like oh that's

what I was thinking when I said do you

have your psionics I meant do you have

amplify available because maybe that can

I don't know how long if it's still up I

don't know how long that's a minute well

you just tape it on crystal and just

like touch it to the wall or something

will happen lose it well this is a

perfect opportunity for Matt to destroy

it and take it away the woman on the

other side of the wall says looks at you

as you like as you're thinking and she

says I applaud your industry this looks

like I do not know what that means

don't touch it that didn't do anything

it just feels like glass you see there's

another door is the the rune is

basically like she's standing on the

ridge like a circle protection and it's

like it's it's you know if this were

it's like circles unapproved okay and

and this this is oh this is like a it's

the circle looks it looks like you know

if you do this not entirely unlike the

semicircle you saw around the door where

it's two circles one two concentric

circles and between them there's all

these [ __ ] runes [ __ ] right this is

the math or Internet so the dots are

that thing on the other side what this

is a zoom in on the dots okay all right

and the the wall is emanating from the

outer circle the edge of the outer

circle defines the prismatic right hmm

and that's prismatic with a lowercase P

I'm aware that there are yeah there are

spells and DMD that you spermatic

something yeah yeah pure coincidence all

right to take my gem and touch it to to

the things see if anything happened

the woman washes and she's fascinating

the gem glows it glows your gem glows

it never does it take away those glow

fit if you use like a glass cutter I

walk in and carry a piece of a dragon

cut from its living flesh Oh fascinating

came you by this sergeant I don't know I

don't tell me I'm keen to guess does it

so do I get the sense that touching it -

like recharged and it like gave me any

charges back or anything that's not like

you you know how many charges your check

I don't know how you know but I know how

much energy it has you can do consents

helmet how much energy has 12 charges

normally correct how many charges are

left right now there are four charges

left they were still four charges last

it has not imbued your is not imbued

your thing with any power oh just the

door that's in the back of this room is

it like one of the silver doors okay yes

the Dragonborn paladin joins you join to

all of you

you're as well you're right mm-hmm are

we all with missing limbs she was

holding no no there how I was standing

outside the room and okay all right the

dragon rolls Haledon stands up and walks

into the room stands near whoever is in

the room slim near near the thing

we're free to interpret that however you

want do you wanna how uh how many

charges is at the amplify Phil there's a

four-four

I am lady erosive are what manner of

creature are you

you're the only one they're just like

standing closer to you than I am right

now mm-hmm

what slim say Oh I'll be in the room as

well okay yeah I had also walked in

there I don't think slim would answer

that it's Lily I think he thinks it's a

dumb question okay I really don't know

what to do with this I think so can you

your beige hand to psionic right mm-hmm

can you try to press on it with your

mage hand like I'm curious if psionics

go through it and if so yeah and not

we're we don't want to break your

crystal so we're not gonna use the last

charges right right we have to come back

but yeah if Sonics go through it then we

can use amplify to try to shatter the

barrier so if I okay so I wanna I'm

gonna use mine I mean I don't think it's

actually mage hand I think it's like

it's something equivalent equivalent

it's not the spell major I want to try

to use my mage hand and sort of trace

the inner circle so you're a loner

you're able to manifest your agent mm-hm

okay a but it cannot penetrate a wall I

don't know

mm-hmm and you can't you can't manifest

it inside the wall if you try to

manifest it inside the wall your mission

manifests outside that's the first magic

that's my cast I mean I can that's true

yeah yeah it worked magic it was not

magic it's not magic Oh was the first

capabilities thing that worked in here

yeah um I think Lady Rose [ __ ] goes and

turns and leaves

walked past all your votes that starts

exiting I'm gonna claw her and say hold

on and on that I think we might need you

for this

the church must be told what's grabbing

here oh boy well don't you want to get

this person out so you should we should

go stop her it's like a solid she's

sober then can I still see lady or I can

misty misty step through into until you

try if you try to miss you step in in

yeah you end up just on the other side

it's a little it's a little disorienting

you're not used to not ending up exactly

where you expected issue within steel

casting distance okay so whatever I put

a seal on somebody do they know that

cause I see it no I think it says in the

hill we go right up but the person who's

been sealed no knows that they've been

censured

they just don't know it's not on what it

is I I think that I think that already

write it I can look it up I'm at a loss

anyway so well she can't get rid of it

so I'm gonna pose oh yeah okay well she

can't get rid of it so that's good okay

so I'm gonna go ahead and like quickly

apply a seal to her I don't want my

sword it's just Clank like I just like

it's just like hitting up hitting a

solid brick don't I'm gonna use

suggestion and I'm going to suggest to

her that she stay here and help us I'm a

suggestion work so suggestion is you

suggest a course of activity at your

sentence or two and magically influence

a creature you can see within range they

can hear and understand you creatures

that can't be charmed our immune the

destined must be awarded in such a

manner as to make the course of action

sound reasonable

if the target must make a wisdom saving

throw failed save it pursues the course

of action you describe to the best of

its ability duration up to eight hours

so it's going to be a disadvantage for

you because you have a seal on yourself

manage what kind of

[ __ ] I uh I'm letting you know now

because it's your class the next version

of the ill rigger the whole thing is

that if you want to do your crazy [ __ ]

you have to use the seals and it's not

always one you put sometimes I think

we're like the architect of ruin it's

like if you want to impose disadvantage

on somebody for a save you have to burn

one of your seals you don't you have to

put it on them you just have it and go

she's more about using your seals at

night we have three different things and

I got a six which means I filled my

wisdom singing Pro this yeah she gonna

steam help she turns around and she says

you are quite helpless

you might be my eight I think we do I

think so I think I'm actually gonna take

off exile and leave exile in the hole

and then walk into the your sorts yeah

she picks it up and don't don't leave me

like I'm gonna leave it here because

there's something going on with this

room it's a special sword so we go in

the room and I'm gonna suggest or not

[Laughter]

but I think I'll say like you know this

is a gemstone dragon it you have a

gemstone from a bigger jump starter

dragon presumably do you want to see if

the night the lady night and take the

stone and if there's any difference are

you asking me if I want to give my stone

to this green dragon not permanently I

just remember old but my progenitor was

Ruby

Oh interesting Christmas colors no yeah

no no way someone's gonna give that

thing up don't we handing it to

somebody's giving up well using both

hold hands

it's like Mahal dit and she like wants

to do that well it's more it's more like

I believe that like you know this is a

gemstone from a dragon as the lady and

the thing said well [ __ ] I wouldn't know

this she might she might have a

sun-dried gemstone correct yeah she's

never had to do anything with her

abilities know that she's but gems don't

Dragonborn aren't dragon are in their

their their missile gets ionics they

well they correct yeah but limited

silent correct yeah but anyway I was

thinking she might have a stronger

connection with it and then because you

have a very strong psychic connection

but this is this is from something tied

to her species or her ancestry she may

place the tip of her finger on it it's

gonna be like like a Ouija oh yeah

where's my it's at the end of the

gemstone you just passed up where's my

NIC to Spain [ __ ] love she's under my

influence at the moment so she's here to

help us

what and they don't think dr. so I think

um she's not gonna take it from you

she's not gonna steal it from you is

that would not be helpful can I do all

right

or you want her to do well I mean she's

not she looks at your crystal it's like

what's limited Sonics she can she can do

things that the crystal and do not

everything I don't know what why don't

you just try touching the the prism I

have touched it you

yes with your sword yeah I remember she

was clanging so what happens if you

touch touch this gem she touches the

gems you think does anything happen what

is that uh where did you come by that

was given to me it disturbs her what

color is that it's a rainbow

same kind of probably it's not dead what

happened whenever you touch them you saw

things it filled me with unease I I

don't know guys why did why

what is this charade I am I'm

undertaking why did you ask this up me I

thought maybe that you and the crystal

would have a stronger connection because

whenever he touches the crystal to the

prismatic force field here um it does

something the crystal begins to glow and

so the the agent within says that this

crystal is part of a gemstone dragon and

so with you being a gemstone Dragonborn

crystal dragon

so she says this was just given later

VNT it says I just want mm-hmm so I

thought maybe if you hold the crystal

and touch it to the thing it would be a

stronger and be able to break the break

the prism I'm gonna have the night lady

rose afar I'll make an insect check she

stands in front of the the wall

basically in the same position in the

same pose that slim was in when he was

using his gemstone

and she concentrates and she starts to

and the wall can go for a second and it

becomes markedly more transparent in a

spot and then a lady roses out she's the

one well now we may have the means to

bring down your wall so do you want to

communicate with us well you're an

optimist she says I enjoyed that display

I I admitted that together we are

certainly making progress but I think

this seems as though tap-tap-tap we

still have a way to go ahead why do we

care about this creature I don't know

she she's in some way and she the enemy

she works for the black iron I am NOT

here enemy I admire the gift they're

fantastic warriors mm-hmm

do you don't got anywhere true but we're

trying to see if we can mutually help

each other we need information on the

black our impact we need to down and

murder them in their sleep what the did

or meant is that we came down here we

came down here to slow that's why they

came down that's she she may have

information for how we can get through

the other doors to get the wards which

is why we're here I do have that

information

so she says mm-hmm there you yes

can I do it inside check Steve she's I

don't like if you if you can get past

those sure yeah Josh for those awards

why can't you get out of this trap uh I

did not say I could get past those words

I saw it I know how it can be done I

know how it was done and when the time

comes I know how it will be done again

does your spandex give you the ability

to like detect thoughts or anything like

that

I go ahead make your all I mean judges

your nowhere I mean we have a post

judges ability to detect that's true

what's the matter like drink

[ __ ] the curse is back three well before

earlier I lost four of my agents trying

to infiltrate the black iron pact and

when the time came I took matters into

my own hands and was successful in lo

these past four days I have walked among

them unseen and unknown and she looks at

the ring she says passing as one of them

and then she turns around and sits back

down against the wall well if the black

our impact are your enemies

then you're our friend we do tell us

what organization or entity or whatever

sent you here

I sent me this is this is kind of a long

shot but I can I can communicate with

somnom tip to numerous like I wonder if

I asked the Navigator I'm gonna describe

to the navigator when I hear the voice

in your head this is ship intelligence

and I want to describe what I see and

ask it if and try to find out if it

knows anything about this sort of thing

like I said it's a long shot

if it has any like sort of information

databases or you know I'm a writer

sometimes I've got to write um we should

probably try and get the Dragonborn

resuscitative oh yeah I'm not kidding

it's magic yeah let it sleep true

actually

it's dinner

no no tell the church about oh yeah oh

yeah let's leave it seriously what a

waste

let's just leave her sleep yeah I think

if she's yeah then she'll forget her

flapping her jealous and from the story

she's given us she's the only one from

that organization that knows about this

place

yeah followed them down there oh ten

zero in your head say the barrier you

describe registers as a type 5 min talaq

shield man and how do you nullify this

type 5 mint mint Alec shield psionic

energy psionic energy defeats the shield

away

salan is that what amplified oh yeah let

me try this

I'm not gonna do amplify and she stands

up but Jesus now um I will try using

Flay on and that only cost me two

charges so I won't you know if you use

two charges on the crystal well that

will that mean that you can you don't

even have option to use amplify anymore

cuz it's four charges right well I

wouldn't because I don't want to destroy

it it recharges

yeah it'll recharge it at the end as

long as it's easy

Zoid be fun bright even if it doesn't

does it automatically fail if you use

all charges or is our chance that it

fails if you use no charge I'm pretty

sure if I knew all the charges it just

know it says if I use all the turkey

turns into an inert precious stone there

was something there used to be magic

items where I had one in 20 chance I

think the staff is like that all right

you watch slim as he had holds the and

his eyes glow and then a blast their own

of psionic energy erupts from his eyes

and it's the same it's much brighter

it's solid and it blasts into the wall

in it that's deflected off the wall but

you definitely see there's some

interference between his psionic blast

and the energy of the wall wall doesn't

drop though it doesn't do the thing it

did when Lady Rose 'var concentrated on

it it doesn't do that thing where it

turns my it's hard to see though maybe

underneath so this the the solid blast

of psionic energy maybe there's some

transparent space behind there but you

can't see it other well otherwise the

whole wall in that area of your of your

of your cone it

it reacts wildly with your with your

psionic energy but only what the [ __ ]

huh no is it no more how long does it

take to uh recharge that crystal I can

get what is it certain amount back it's

like a 1d for every day I think it's a

d6 mm-hmm

with a long rest or you know a day looks

like we get a bit yeah completing a long

rest

yeah I mean he recharges and we can go

full forgive my lost on here right Trey

amplify with the sword yes Lord slice

losses d6 maybe well maybe no I wasn't

dying from work he's gonna roll at least

a three yeah right but what else we

doing right now

we've have a kid

enjoy that or it's ten thirty quid left

thumbs that we've been playing for a

little over three hours it was a good

place to stop what you guys been trying

to do you guys gonna rest did somebody

say rest a week we definitely did not to

get the to game charged up again so you

can use use full charge if he rolls a

three or better well yeah I didn't say

if that's my mommy cut the noise a 3 or

a 3 or better he's got because I have to

roll d6 to recharge at 2cm rape charges

come back right but you only have two

charges left right so five year-old a

six you'd only have a charges yeah damn

you know I don't know if it matters

where you guys want to rest yeah pop

back after the booty sure yeah a usual

thing should I made sure I wrote my nose

even for you ready do they know how how

do I get this thing down yeah did I like

probably investigate the room a little

bit more good yes we haven't really done

door yeah doors and you already go okay

so it leads it you can open it it leads

down the the arc the curved corridor ten

feet wide that led to this room with the

prismatic cage and it continues and it

ends there's an archway and there's a

20-foot room actually yeah there's a

30-foot room there 30 foot wide that has

no walls and appears to just be normal

that's nothing nothing don't go to the

middle of the room yes maybe you can

investigate if you want yeah I'm going

to investigate I never ran around I

think a good investigator 1912

yeah actually - yeah but it's just

serious 19 from leach yeah I mean it's a

stone room like the rest of the

every every you know the marble room

with the prismatic wall it was special

mm-hmm but the rest of this complex

every surface is carved with figures

from an ancient empire and you the only

thing you notice is that the floor isn't

flat okay it's very very very slightly

convex mm-hmm if you look up now when

you look as you realize as you realize

that you look up the ceiling is also

convex okay so that it's actually but

it's so minor yeah and if you walked

across it would seem like it was flat

bye apart from that nothing else it's

just that's it there's nothing else in

it just no I mean it's it's in a very

old room yeah yeah a little 20 but 20

room 30 it's it's a 30 feet across

around room 30 feet across okay hmm well

there's that other door that's a jar in

the main a the chamber yeah yeah there's

no doors in this room no not that you

can see and you've evil drown yeah I

look around I can't I have to even her

all the 20 that's one more than what oh

dear oh yeah something heavy seems like

it's but we can't let her go tell ya if

I if I dip to crossbow in someone to

drown my just kind of make her sleep of

inland there is the door of the door the

ajar silver door in the antechamber I

like that anyway yeah and the the tunnel

the so yeah what you have have the map

that I kind of showed you guys

so the tunnel the tunnel you guys came

in leads to this large arcing yeah like

there's a huge circle here and this is

the antechamber that leads to the

Crystal Room yeah this is the prism room

this was if this was a door that was

open when you came in yeah so not only

is there this door there's also this

quarter and there's this court

it's just that when you come out here

you can kind of sort of see this room

from here yeah right so it's kind of a

first it's right it's the first thing we

saw do not look at this drawing unless

you can imagine it much better let's go

look at it

Wow violin violin violin dia all right

well let's go so we can see the cool map

yeah pick a room any room picking a jar

door right yes the antechamber yeah I

why wait by a violin - yeah good luck

[Music]

was there anything in the nil I don't

think there is yeah how do I run this

way we should kill that one - mmm I

agree sir for information I'll for

killin that lady's so yeah there's a

silver door it is ajar yeah it leads to

a metal room right is also circular it's

the same size and dimensions as the room

with lady Olympia in it okay except

instead of being a marble it's metal and

it looks as though there are there are

bumps and uneven surfaces all throughout

it and closer inspection reveals that

there was there was something much like

the rest of this dungeon that has all

these figures and symbols carved along

the walls there was something here but

it has been pounded flat the metal has

been pounded flat by tools

but it's hard to see how so it looks

like beaten metal like that's what the

bumps the irregular well it's like you

know yeah like you can sits imagine a

coin mm-hmm with you know a face on it

and text on it and then if somebody took

that coin and just beat it so that

eventually you couldn't see the face

anymore maybe there was something there

once mmm maybe there was writing here

once but all you see now is the is yeah

who's the hammer so it was like

something in here and it was trying to

beat its way out like this is where they

imprison the whole person is the floor

metal - and and Zeeland

what kind of metal is it well you're

gonna go in and investigate I want to go

in and investigate who's going in I'm

way up 20 you notice the same thing you

noticed before which is the floor and

the ceiling are both mm-hmm convex and

concave okay other than that means you

mean that they're rounded no I mean not

what it means

what is it surrounded

what's the soup du jour it's the soup of

the day mmm that sounds delicious

I'll have that you notice actually it's

who's got you eat one two or three and

two or three for that it's top judge

yeah Matt it starts to get cold in here

the temperature drops dramatically

it's no less for me they're not this big

they are they're they're one square big

these well I mean

smokes neck smooth oh yeah snake sick

Pig yes same bloody Hill every he

doesn't miss it snake yeah you see this

cloud looks very like that except it's

only it's man-sized it's not huge like

that and it is it materializes there are

I think three of them and they

materialize around the three of you

almost like condensation and rippling

through the smoke or these blood-red

veins and it's otherwise lacks any

distinctive feature and starts to rain

on you blood and you feel very sad and

they each one of them move into your

space and the rest of you see boots and

judge and leach enveloped in these red

pulsing clouds see you folks next week

[Music]
