I didn't trust you but I was right not

to trust you wasn't I

welcome to the show everybody my name is

Matthew Colville these are my friends

we're a bunch of game developers who get

together on Wednesday nights to play

Dungeons and Dragons normally we are

joined by our friend Matt O'Driscoll but

metal Driscoll is hung over on an

airplane that is not leaving Vegas so we

are going to play without it certainly

he's our replacing him next week he's a

big wanker anyway he's not here yeah

so some commitment we left our heroes

slim had barred the door of the candle

shop which actually I should actually

borrow it I just put my hand in front

mini this property represents lady arosa

VARs rolling to the left of the box grab

if you have it let's use it and slim

said you can't leave so yeah here's lady

Rosa bar yeah I believe King said you

can't no slim and said you can't leave

and she said she said take your hand off

that door or just battle between us oh

yeah that's right

I miss that and then I say have you no

honor lady or osbahr you're gonna leave

that woman to starve in a trap she may

be an enemy but nobody deserves that we

carried the princess seal and we intend

to bring the black iron pack to justice

and that woman is our best chance at

Intel for that speaking of this place

will only cause chaos in the city and

strife for the common folk a discovery

like this will draw the eye of Ajax and

cause the houses and guilds to further s

the war that is brewing are you willing

to be the individual who causes that

suffering to the people of capital let

me see it's a watertight argument yeah

no I'll be the judge of that

well go ahead and make a what check what

check are you intending on this being

modifier for logic unfortunately as

we've learned recently in this country

there is no logic skills okay I would

say real pissed if she's been the most

on submersion trail piss well she wants

to stick around and help us fight

that's right that's not waste of time

you could use out enemies yeah mm-hmm

yeah even if he did I'd be a wink about

it's really good I was going about it no

I said even if he decides to be awake I

mean it wouldn't be the first time that

I think of a plan and Matt goes oh

that's really good except he pulls out a

scroll and walks out of the bubble as

far as you know a calla roll the vial

had that scroll the entire teka teka

dawn says water should have started with

ma'am so we can hear we can hear people

laughing in the go ahead make a

persuasion check with advantage nice you

wrote out a whole speech oh my

god my sense enough you can't no well

actually can you guide yourself

it just is it's not hard to just touch

it unless you're pushing rope and then

yes I actually don't know can you

cascais it because I have not cast back

pesto enthusiasts is gonna tell us

whether or not you can one of the mods

yes yes okay yeah go ahead yeah yes I

think I think I think this was from the

guidance yeah I think you've already

cast guys this is plus four how do you

plus three plus four

well guidance and then yeah my

persuasion well she has anti persuasions

what a surprise me she's a stubborn

 yeah your way stuff I don't like

being the only Minnie in this room and

they're talking in there they said my

name once trying to be wanks just yeah I

know I knew I knew when you were writing

this I knew when you came on your office

Hugh Kim thought his office me I got it

no idea was know so how was leading

arose barb she pulls out her sword kind

of size me to the chest you've sent a

couple of the magic words she definitely

does have her hand on her she has in her

left hand she has the shield of made of

the falling star medal in her honor but

she hasn't drawn her other her sword her

hand is on the pommel Jesus feels like

she's among friends carried her ass

around yeah right how's that not a

friend fun bake at nice and comfy I do

not accept lecture is on honor from

mercenaries what is the woman maybe

behind the behind the prismatic wall to

you the only way to get information on

hidden organization the black iron pact

that is plaguing the city well we only

had information once the church finds

out how to free her from her prison do

you think the church is going to be the

people who do that when the church is

the one who has potentially incited this

war by taking the fulcrums territory I

know that the I know that the bishop at

their very least can get through that

wall and I don't think you can and she

goes to cope with adoringly you can get

through that wall you said to believe in

yourself slim are you still blocking the

way to the door no then she's gonna

leave well you told her that the blow is

gonna be on her hands yep well she

didn't care about her 24 I mean she

doesn't she hasn't she hasn't she hasn't

attacked you

she's just said that she's gonna go tell

her boss what's going on and her boss

can fix this or make it worse well

that's on her boss no that's on you it's

on her

yeah we just explained how the fun

hearthfire just fighting more in the

city I mean taking territory I've

already proven that you have mistaken me

for another one of your mercenaries I

care not for the city or the innocence

and within it yeah what kind of net are

you I'm a knight of the falling star I'm

a knight of Saint Isabella I seek

justice this is something you know a

little about and she leaves all right

 her good riddance yeah we heard de

Scipio Jack yes you never know when I'm

gonna need this again at some point in

the future I did this whole map and

everything

well you avoided a fight mm-hmm for now

now Kaos plays into our chaos is good

for us right so you got you folks are

going to leave this as you can see based

on the map this part there's actually

cool mini this is the whole map yeah

it's got he's got like a halberd and

it's broken off so he came and see it's

it's a cool mini I see but it's uh it's

seen better days that's the whole area I

am missing my leaves or my phasers

I'm missing my laser names but this half

of the thing that's your laser pranic

you need you also need one this is the

abandoned candle maker shop and this is

the abandoned butcher shop okay right

next to each other I'm sure that

somewhere around here is an abandoned

Baker shop it's disguise self that you

have right not yes so this is about here

mhm

as you guys this isn't alleyway hmm

right so that's the trap door you folks

come up and Lady Rose of our leaves

peacefully without getting in a fight

you were able to persuade her not to

attack you and you exit on the into the

alleyway is only about ten feet wide and

it spills out here onto the street and

this from when you are out on the street

you can see through those little lines

are the windows that are the show the in

so I wanna I want to interrupt your

cussin Oh change the plan do you want to

cast this guy's self on yourself

deliver a message to Scipio come back

we'll crash and get back in there cuz we

need to take care of it as quickly as

possible I just want the clock is

ticking I have three eight points you're

not gonna find anybody you're gonna go

see angel talk to Scipio come back here

and crash hopefully I have tried

anything why can't you use your your

diplomats patch to have angel delivers

the message or jets if you come here cuz

Scipio doesn't know angel we don't want

people knowing about this entrance and

right now the only other person other

than the chain that knows about it is

the stupid dragon lady so

gotcha all right yeah that sounds good

so you're gonna go tell Scipio about

lady erosive are what she knows where

she's going and let the Sapphire sky

decide what they want to do with her or

intercept her whatever they want to do

and then angel angel can come here and

guess whatever info done you can come

back in and your disguise self we can

rest in yo I'm gonna go ahead and cast

here wounds on butts fun

it's button buds yeah it

I'll do the same thanks Clark I will

about what spell are you casting are you

casting I'm hearing rumors that you're

casting disguise self on yourself yeah

you're casting disguise boots yes and

what are you disguising yourself as one

giant yellow submarine monopoly no I'll

just disguise myself as a sort of a

nondescript rioja who is not a mercenary

of the chain back yeah and massively

armed right to d8 and that's just give

the boys sword back Silas and go he's

also got a fancy new rig here yeah well

that's right

well yeah but more so so he doesn't have

to Exodus this guy's to prove who he is

- yeah you just have a conversation with

them and come back okay like a meeting

room maybe as far as we know he's

sitting in the business center yep

alright so yeah just sort of still still

a real gentleman but okay and the rest

of you were gonna stay here and sleep or

random yes some wait the rest and wait

for him to come back okay

you should definitely short rest we

should probably give we should give

angel them a heads up if we have a way

to contact them because as soon as that

laser slowing people will be when I

start coming to the sausage shop yeah

you may want is gonna be pissed we may

want to give up one of our guards or one

of the people watching the shop one of

our princess seals the

say off I mean eyeball dude yeah I

mean I can give my note for now Sonny

was gonna have to pick that up it's not

paper it's not like wine the city's what

we had told we had told frost and sucked

to go send angel over

yeah and they had already left so so I

know what you're doing what do you guys

want waiting for Ames we'll just show up

here okay so you head over to the

dancing minstrel mm which is in the same

district right so you don't have far to

go and it's I think have you guys what

was last thing we did a long rest

we were about to look we're trying to do

a long rest when the so it's it's like

about an hour before sunset okay and the

Sun is low in the sky casting long

shadows across the city but it's still

bright enough to see without people

having to going light the lamps and the

dancing minstrel is at this time of day

relatively busy 30 people in it from

various walks of life most of them

visiting the city on business visiting

this district on business from other

parts of the city and it takes a second

but you can see Marcellus Scipio is at a

table in front of the in front of the

small stage that has barred sitting on

it playing music it's very loud in here

other people talking a lot of good doing

business as you by himself at that table

yeah all right yeah I'm just gonna walk

up and and just be like hey do you mind

if I I'm just gonna sit down and all

under puts his hand he puts his hand on

his on his not magic under the table

[Music]

goodness yeah under the table I'll hand

him his sword and like he pushes himself

back from the table because he doesn't

know what's going on but then he looks

down and he sees his family sword and

all and he's gathering and say thanks

for this he looks at you he looks at you

like judge the other one copper and I'll

stick a boot out from under the table

yeah I'm like sort of nod towards it he

puts his hand on the sword and he says

are you finished with this uh yeah found

a better one

ring well already yields its secrets he

says and he looks around like should I

be careful as a super he's super

enthusiastic because when he's like and

he still a college student yeah he's

super enthusiastic to talk to you about

what's going so he leans in and he says

what word from well we be ran into a

spot of bother down there as it were

I'll just briefly explain we ran into a

group of dudes from black iron packed

and he's managed to best most of her

name looks around like I puts his hand

over his drink for a second then he

takes a drink India's like act they're

one step ahead of us yeah and what's

worse is I think there's one of them

inside ring well deeper than we managed

again read quietly it's just that this

may be above I am only a newly sponsored

member this may be above my he doesn't

say this may be about my pay grade he's

but he says the Rio and equivalent this

may be above my pay grade

yeah he's like come with me all right

and he throws some coins on the table

and walks up

I'll follow them out and say what's more

there may be another piece of well I

don't want to say it's bad news but

elicitation it's yeah it's news you you

guys should your organization should

certainly know about this news what news

now you're out on the street and it's a

little bit safer it's a little harder

for somebody to kind of spy on you but

he's leading you down to an alleyway hmm

I was like news what news come come come

yes well we we weren't the only ones who

who encountered the black iron pact

there was a dragon born night and night

of the falling star follow them followed

a small advance party of the black iron

packed into ring well fought them lost

one of them another one still trapped

down there we think might be a mole that

had infiltrated the the pact but I'm

you're overwhelmed me with with detail

well I mean you know try Kiba yes yeah

so I'll he's explained how she basically

like you know we we fought the black

iron pact we ran into a lot of nasty

stuff down there and we were in no

condition to be able to physically stop

at night of a falling star from leaving

of her own court he's trying to order

things in his head it's it's confusing a

mole what mean you buy this what mole

well it was a she looked like the the

wizard that we had fought earlier

dressed in the regalia of the black iron

packed but simply took the ring off and

said that a fake yeah

rather cryptically that things are not

as they seem and suggested that that the

black eye impact was a common enemy of

ours um all did you identify yourselves

as members of at this point now you guys

are in the alleyway yeah of the of the

sky

uh no only as the as members of the

chaîne is it possible the vial silencer

hasn't told me everything yes more so

it's likely is it possible that she

isn't one of ours it's not impossible he

takes the sapphire ring off his finger

and holds it up and then splits it in

the in this and as you watch it spin up

into the ground when he catches it out

of the out of the air but back HQ your

your now you are under your under it's

sapphire this brilliant sapphire sky a

green rolling hills another world angel

shows up it actually you get you feel

the weight shift in your diplomatic

pouch I shout inter planar shrug what is

this place you're at the Campbell maker

maker um how's it going everybody I hope

you having a good time

[Music]

so like there's a about two and a half

minutes goes by and then Angel pops is

like the trapdoor opens up and angel

goes oh he shows he shows up and angels

that for those who don't know angels are

happening he's one of the junior

officers of the chain of Akron and he is

the head of your spy network which you

folks have spent quite a lot of money to

found do you remember how much you spent

it was about three pounds yeah so you

guys are you guys I'd like a second

spy network based on this number of

people he's able to recruit and how much

money you guys have spent and that gives

you access to certain actions you can

take every season and hearing capital I

think a season is probably less than

three months because as urban adventures

tend to have the scale is smaller and

things happen faster but yeah he shows

up and he's like what are we doing in

here boss not drawing attention to the

train being near the butcher shop as you

stated shouldn't we be at the dancing

minstrel no we got to go back in there

so we're crashing here and getting back

in Oh fair enough yeah it's what do you

need for me you left and I thought you

want to give him a date well yeah well

you want talk to me talk you will tell

him about ring well tell him about the

black iron packed down there we'll tell

him about lady a rosa bar that she could

be a problem

she's one of the only people outside in

capitals that we know of that knows this

place right yeah that's a problem so

who's she with

she is with the Knights of the falling

star it was nice of the falling star got

it and she's going to talk to her bishop

right now I mean pretty clear a danger

angel if you're like asking for a hit on

her

yeah that's Louisa I don't think we

should make it look like an accident

does anybody know she was down here she

I mean what it's been like maybe five

minutes

come on he's gonna leave something I'm

gonna hit you know I thought the whole

thing we could have just killed her here

if that's the case but I thought the

point is we don't want to kill her

because like it would it would if it

could try to make a buck an accident you

can but there's strong magic out there

that lets them speak in communion with

her after she's dead and she can tell

them otherwise she doesn't know how she

died mmm

we also have the tech thing against

detection location necklace whatever the

question is is do we believe angel can

handle this global five and you guys

were worried that she's hired well well

I just worried that even if he makes an

accent I worry about it get back to us

I worry about this being a super

dangerous thing that gets angel caught

out because I really angel they'll be

pretty bad yeah I think it's more

important that we try to make this area

not look like where she was so it's

gonna be very confusing to find a place

I don't know how she familiar she is

with this area or following them into

there and that kind of thing cuz we want

nobody getting further in the butcher

shop we need some engineers he says

should also protect this area too I mean

they can't it's not just the butcher of

their Kendall shop two separate yeah how

much does she know about how much does

she know about what's going on

downstairs because angel hasn't been

down there by the way yeah he's been

he's been down into the caves with the

black eye impact Doug looking for ring

well that's how he set this whole thing

up but he hasn't been anywhere near like

ringing all the way you guys have how

much does she know about how much does

she know about additional it's called

[Music]

did you ever use the term ring well

around I don't remember if we have I

appreciate you as long as I don't

remember I think I thought we ever said

that I think King told her everything

no I had mentioned that we were here on

a mission run the Sapphire sky to get

Ward's because I never intended to

delete this place with her so but she

knows what she's seen she knows that the

black iron pact is down there and some

of them are still down there she knows

that we were down there on a mission to

stop the black iron impact as we stated

to her um if we get she knows that she

knows and get nod or it's and the green

boots down here we might be able to move

stuff around a little bit mm-hmm there's

to be it'll be tight like mud that's it

mud and her team the advancers aren't

engineer

yeah but they do have experience as

sappers it's close

they take hours at the least but I don't

know how long it's gonna be but if she

knows the name of this place then she

could give it to her boss or boss casts

a spell as a million spells well there's

a lot of war does to protect the

location of this place in general but if

you know an entrance you know an

entrance yeah you folks found it Oh a

few changes well what else you tell

something escaped from there and we'll

tell him to I think it was that part

yeah thank you for the gift it stopped

support my son's name is also port well

uh well tell him walked in about the

Sapphire sky uh that there I think he

knows everything that has happened

before you guys went into ring well okay

I assume he set this whole thing up for

instance you know so tell him on the rod

we found down there we'll tell him about

the lady who could be a mole for the

black iron pact don't you tell them

about how much do you like it's like

tell me like I'm there it's important

yeah well I'm tired

I know lorises actually exhausted can I

go write it down she's no longer book

yeah she's still down there she's

trapped in some kind of prismatic

barrier uh uh her name is violencia de

Lozano

she appears as de Lozano yeah she

appears as somebody from the black iron

impact but has stated that she's not

that yeah if we can get her out of that

barrier

she's uh willing to talk to us what did

you try uh well we tried using this

ionic crystal against it we tried having

the Dragonborn woman try to find her way

through it she tried to slam her weapon

against it a lot well he's got doesn't

though doesn't slim have insulin just

know I tried to do that we can't you

can't use magic in the room it's uh

surrounded by an anti magic barrier can

use magic in the room yeah like I tried

to chaos fell into the movement and it

was ineffectual or outside the room sir

you have any kind of ocular magic

available to you right now mm-hmm

like what mmm

like I can

speak with Asmodeus to try and get a

reading on something ask Asmodeus what's

in that room and that's not that kind of

thing the way it works is that I can if

I have a course of action I want to take

the next 30 minutes I can determine

whether it's how the outcome will be

generally by Euler whoa yeah angels like

I don't know them well I can't tell you

what to do with your uh P point C points

to the sky that he's like we're down

there maybe if I can rest I can cast

divination no we don't got time for that

if I can get if I can catch up with this

lady right oh I see you're saying so I

can I can know God's can see in there if

the gods can't see in there then we can

bag this night of the falling star

take her down there no one can buy her

hmm but if the gods can't see in their

right working there here's the thing

there are rooms down there that are

lead-lined that know magic

yeah even it but like you know but it's

to stop things from outside I think that

works against some stuff yeah but if

there's if you found a room but no magic

yeah and to what counts is magic you

says right what counts as magic like

okay so the slims thing didn't work on

ik yeah but the church doesn't have

access to that kind of crazy alien ship

so if the gods can't see in their bag

this lady you take her down there and do

what you want with her attire up don't

tie her up I don't care but no one can

find her interesting in that sense say

if we killed it we should bring her back

down yeah I can't find the body they'd

have to find the place right the whole

ordeal grabbing her and bringing her

down that room I would take like what

happened our well you be successful yeah

well cuz if so I can just I can just

take a glimpse and see how that's gonna

turn out for us

but I can't I'm just a I'm just an

assassin I just do what I'm told

the thing is there's not there my

abilities will allow me to request

something specific like that to look

into that room I'm just saying I don't

want you taking her down there he's like

I got an eye I've been down there so I

haven't seen what you folks have seen I

haven't done what you people have done

but if they can't see in if they can

then it's all we do is make a Star Wars

but I might be able to go back mm-hmm

well if we're gonna bag her anyway

like at the very least we have to put

her somewhere we should put her in the

room where no magic and seems to be able

to enter it that's the way that I feel

about it I know what you thinking so do

you but if the gods can see in there

then all we're doing is making things

worse angel says why don't you cast the

spell and yeah what would you ask that

would determine if just asking if we

could see you there

we all can you see in this room we are I

guess I could ask what would be the

outcome if we are able to get that get

that mole out like if we're able to

break her out of a cage she's in

essentially because that's in that room

and so maybe I can figure out them and

that's a that's a later problem

I think that's he he's trying to say he

has moodiest asking about this person in

this room and if he can't if he's like

what what person and what I yeah what

will happen if we wax this and put a

green dragon well that's like so bad

guys we put her in this pocket universe

of the south nice guy you look like

boots about now yeah as soon as you

arrive it may not be obvious now you're

back to be in Boots cool and you enter

the tower of the Sapphire sky and you

see the normal kind of wizard tower

nonsense that happens in here a lot of a

lot of research being done some

experimentation you go up to the top

the tower and there's a command room and

as was here last time there's a moon elf

I mean 12 feet tall hovering over this

pool and there's a war board that has a

map of capital on it and there are

people discussing various options then

it takes a minute you're just here

talking to Marcellus for a few moments

and then the viol silencer comes in and

he's got like it looks like he's just

he's like finishing putting his armor on

hmm and this is as you remember this is

an aging orc 1/2 work an actual orc who

was wearing this kind of I think it's I

think it's blue and gold armor of the

Sapphire sky and he says you live what

news from ring well yeah barely

thank you Marcellus bring bring our

friend something to drink Thanks ah well

news for sure we we got in there we

encountered made it you've been doing

well you've been inside or to some to

some extent maybe it was just like sort

of an antechamber or something we we

came across one door that had these

rooms that were filled with gold that

had been evacuated and it was unsealed

and then we found the chamber that the

Sun elf came from yes then that is

definitely ring well Bravo yeah but

there was a where in the city is it it's

beneath this it's beneath this mostly

abandoned block of shops well they were

probably with many ways down how did you

find it we tracked the we tracked thee

was it the son yeah it was the son of

stress yeah we we tracked the son elf

back to this abandoned butcher shop

little done well done found the black

iron packed know what yeah and we when

you

you found them were there that were they

already there yeah

well one one was and well okay let me

let me I guess let me run through this

chronologically uh he's like you have to

be my eyes and ears and he he kids who

uh a piece of paper and a quill and says

and starts like what did you see how did

you get in alright I'll draw him out a

you know I'll sketch out the map for him

um he's super interested in this stuff

now there's got a whole cadre of all the

kind of the senior members of the

Sapphire sky they're in this room and

we're all gathering around and they're

all asking questions about like how did

you get in here what's in this room

what's though what's the floor like

what's the there's fascinated by were

there signs anywhere with the signals

anywhere could you read any other

writing basically I mean the whole thing

but yeah it's play everything that I was

there for at least so I'm not gonna try

and find them right okay I think I might

try and like you telling the stuff I

told ourselves Oh God important what

yeah he's not here he's not here yeah

but he's his moment I'm gonna give him

like the short version of it right sure

I'm trying to get to this part where

they're obviously more interested in

learning about what's going on ring ring

yeah then hearing the details of your

story they're like this is something

they've been working on for a long time

yeah well I guess let me say this then

it at a certain point like like once

it's once I've kind of explained like

the timeline of it all and make you know

it I'm not gonna answer questions about

like tiny details I'm just gonna be like

listen there was you know there was

someone else there someone else you said

you fought the black iron back we've

bought the black iron packs one of them

escaped they all start looking at each

other like escaped teleported out of

there just well I finished rucas broken

a stick and then just ah see into thin

air

you know what that is yes yeah it's an

obscure spell that you cast on an object

it can be any object it could be

something mundane in fact they probably

should be something mundane and if that

option breaks it takes you back to

wherever you cast the spell clever well

yeah one of them one of them did that

one of them well the rest of them how

many were there we fought we fought six

so one of the six that we fought

vanished there were three others that

you've fought six members of the black

iron pact and only one escaped yeah hav

Becker I picked the right allies the

rest who didn't capture any did you he's

like is the idea of you capturing

remember the black iron packed nerds

like hungry no we didn't aside from the

one that escaped dead to the last but

there was there is one still down there

behind a prismatic barrier unable to

escape prismatic barrier but I one of

them says meant Alex Miller uh-huh yes a

mental shield yeah this one claims to be

to be the vowel sounds like pacing back

and forth now thinking every time you

say something is like oh well Molly

Molly more what since again you trapped

one of them you trapped one of them down

there one of them became trapped it

wasn't even aren't doing it was a glyph

in the middle of a room trapped them did

this happen before you can't was this

yeah so one of the wizards and this is

what I've been trying to get to there's

every time ordering in his head because

it's complex because there's more than

one group of black iron pack members

yeah out in the story and before we got

there yes about long before an hour I

think there was a smaller advance group

three of them that were followed down

there by a night of the falling star a

Dragonborn gemstone Dragonborn a night

and like from this church of st. and

then one of the other guys in here

assumed a human Isabella says say I'm

score order Lauren

the Knights there four of them they're

only ever four of them Knights of the

st. Isabella not not her greatest nights

but top yeah

and stubborn as a goat so you know she's

she's been down there she's sort of I

don't know what all she gleaned from

being down there but she seems to have

put herself on a mission to stop the

stop the black iron impact that it cost

and so sheep and where is she now on her

way back to the church seen Isabella at

that the vile silence account slumps

down into a chair he's not pacing

anymore he's like this base that we feel

about it I wish there was more we could

do but we had fought a whole bunch of

very scary stuff I literally died and oh

boy with the details but you're a

resilient Bunch he says a night of the

fall I wish I knew more about the

falling star I wish I could tell you

more but I failed my history check well

there they are apparently an obscure

obscure order I don't know I don't know

which is more important this woman you

have trapped down there or when you

failed to trap well the one that the one

that's trapped how much how much does

this night know

did you ever use he asks the same thing

angel did did you ever used the term

ring will around her to my memory no but

but I was dead two concussions that I

received after that well yeah he wants

to he's like alright lead me through

lead me through the complex and he wants

to like room-by-room what did you got

what did you find all right

and as you're explaining this damn one

of the other wizards that works here was

dressed in this really fine fitting and

like really tightly tailored outfit

comes up and has pens and a folder and

the folder has this symbol it's a circle

it's blue circle dark dark blue circle

with a light line down the middle that's

the one a star and it's this is like a

dossier but it's like a medieval dossier

it's a bunch of pieces of parchment and

notes and stuff like that people have

taken and it's basically what they know

about the falling star carry pieces just

read him the recap it's scary piece my

speak writing down all the nuns since we

get up - yeah so the folks in chat who

joined late can go hey what's going on I

get the recap so so yeah he's asking

about all the difference he has a report

now on the falling star and he says it

wants to know about the room with the

prismatic trap in it so you say this

woman ran in here and there is a glyph

and the glyph fired

yeah and you don't think she's a member

of the pact uh she claims not to be you

know about the Rings yes how do you see

your younger we don't have we have we

have we have we have a fuse and one of

them says we have samples

yes I'm fortunately they're all attached

to fingers she just took hers off and

dropped it to the floor and said things

are not as they seem

and at first any Marsellus speaks up and

says I thought perhaps she might be one

of ours and the bio silencer looks at

the other and they're like well it

sounds like she could be from a similar

organization she said that that our

enemies are her own will heed almost any

regard I think is she's still down there

yeah so it's a there's no no magic works

within the room not even know yeah I

should go down there he says and

Marcellus if it was sir and all the

other ones are like you should not go

down there and it's like well we need to

get her yeah we we tried and I think we

made

minor headway we managed to convince

this gemstone Dragonborn to hold us

ionic crystalline try to force her way

through and it nearly worked but it it

the effort the effort knocked her

unconscious there is a in the group of

wizards and knights that are here in the

top level of the of the sapphire tower I

think it's like the Tower of divination

or something like that one of them's a

gemstone dragon huh and he says what

happened when she tried to bring down

the wall a hole appeared in it he's

basically the issue when the vial

silencer looks at this Knight and says

what does this mean to you and he says

all of the gemstone all of the gemstone

dragonborns Ian points to himself all of

the gemstone Dragonborn in the city are

all many generations removed from the

time under and even I would only be able

to manifest a small amount of psionic

energy mm-hmm but more more would

probably bring the wall down the bio

science is like well what do we have and

they all kind of look around like well

not what we need hmm what is judge do so

just going to so I write I read overall

great real quick yeah um Audrey says

that I can receive an omen about the

result of a specific course of action

that we plan to take so rather than

trying to work around it by saying oh

heavens if we like try to get this

person out of like the barrier in that

room I'm gonna go through the like

specific course of action that was going

to take the Dragonborn I'm going to take

her down into that room okay and then

kill her

basically like do away with her and it's

like how will that turn out for us

I'm sitting in the corner going

lalalalala

so well yeah I mean I'm not is there a

verbal component to the spell a verbal

there's a verbal component okay well

then I'm going to assume that people

that like this is something it's like a

prayer that you speak right when you

cast the spell

yeah and so you're gonna ask as so yeah

what what exactly do you say to Asmodeus

dear Asmodeus hello husband daddy I need

to know the outcome for the chain if we

bring the Dragonborn knight into the

anti-magic room below and kill her there

she'll if she's able to be found

afterwards like how will this turn out

for us okay and what are the possible

results

wheeler whoa or we Liam low you can also

use the words good and bad or fit in

better detail there's a specific D

do you want I'm not gonna find the spell

card no I mean I assume that you ready

with on this ball players haven't yeah

this is course of action the next 30

minute and says when this ball doesn't

take into account as any possible

circumstances that might change the

outcome yeah there was an option on this

they didn't Lister what okay oh yeah

it's in threes I looked up the spell

this in the playbook not on the card

well the cards get you I think about 80%

of the way there but they are limited in

they can fit that's my work

you get you starts down there that's the

next pitch so what's the last option

oh nothing what's the separate results

that aren't especially good or bad

Wheelan Louis for both good and bad

results yeah

whoa for bad wheel for good results

nothing oh man it had this one here huh

I get nothing back no you do you do

sense the somewhat amused presence of

Asmodeus and and the answer is it's not

an answer it's not a word it's almost

like a feeling it's a wordless shrug

well we're good boys that might be uh

yeah let's kill her

wonder what kind of a two-fold gesture

the what the gesture yeah but I feel

like that okay oh you trick so what's

the order boss I'm pretty sure I can

fine

time's a-wasting I'm pretty sure I can

find this lady I mean angel this is me

speaking as Lars to you the other

players uh angels a resource sometimes

with all our resources even if that's

throwing our special arrow down into a

lost pit right speaking of special

arrows what are your thromes do if he

does if he tries a web fireball wax wall

we lost her spine order yeah I mean it's

definitely a big risk but I mean he's

he's I would say a better resource to us

alive than dead

he says oh no I won't get got okay I've

been in this a some longer than you been

in the chain I'm not gonna be I'm not

gonna do it myself

somebody might get caught won't be me do

you have a pass without a trace no no I

didn't take it as my Ranger ability he's

already got to go away nobody can find

him worries as well but it just stops

his stealth buy a new phone who dis

- I mean I guess we gotta try right yeah

can we give him anything what do we like

with my help like it doesn't seem like

there's any ability to know what's going

on in that room whatever happens in that

room is hidden from the eyes of gods

so you didn't he gave that Shrimpton he

talks to Li Chen he's like he and leech

have a little hushed conversation and

leech grabs a potion office belt gives

it angel this is the invisibility potion

No

he seems like a bad idea it's not angel

who's actually gonna be taking care of

it he's gonna have one of his spies

that's where he said you fell was that

just a place where he said to slim the

place never met bill that would be super

weird yeah what was that just to placate

him I do it in sight see if that was the

case well what does that I think I think

I was just the placate him okay we came

inside Chuck I think I got the feeling

though what's his bucket angel the angel

wants to he's kind of hungry and he

wants to do something himself also what

angel the reason booth isn't here is

because I sent boots to alert the

Sapphire sky about this woman as well to

see if they wanted to stop her and bring

her free grant you have to trust me you

have to it you have to you know poker

face or you're just not used to dealing

with angel directly mystic eyes angel

was originally uh sweet sweet sweetener

and usually it's sweet that tells him

what to do

and now he sort of works for boots so

he's not you're not used to plus him

saying I've been in the chain longer

than you I mean he's like I've been an

assassin longer than you've been in the

chain that's that's a bold statement for

postable yeah uh so I think at the end

of the day this is well it's a problem

or could cause all the problems in the

city yeah it doesn't really necessarily

come back to us because it's the

Sapphire sky and well I'm wants to keep

this place hidden so the city doesn't

devolve into chaos

hey grant you you would want to uh take

advantage of the chaos in the city

though right

I want to follow orders boss we want me

to do there's nothing wrong with keeping

or tied up in that room and how could

and if Angela I'm not worried about that

part I'm worried about him getting her

or us potentially lose angel we went

from you guys were scared to fight her

to send our retainer we're never scared

to fight her it was more of just a

matter of like I don't think it's the

best choice would connect us to the

chain with angel it doesn't connect us

to the chain consequences for murdering

the Green Dragon would would directly

impact the chain consequences for

everyone finding out what she knows that

affects the city yep and I care more

about the chain than I in this city I

guess yeah I mean we it's it's not the

adventure we signed up for but we could

just off city I guess I think that

for the lady of brass I'm kind of just

the middle ground here is that we don't

kill her but the problem is that if she

does go off and tell somebody because we

don't take some kind of action is that

sleeping for eight hours just to get

rested so we can go back down in there

knowing that the city is going to be hot

on our heels after the fact is kind of

troublesome it also impacts our ability

to do what we need to do well yeah the

reason I said boots to talk to the

Sapphire sky was to say hey this lady's

going to talk about ring well yeah and

we gotta take care of ring well and you

guys can't come in to ring well you guys

need to do something about this because

we got a loose end

yeah I guess we can see if sapphire sky

steps up to the plate

speaking of which yeah so we're worried

what the hell is going on oh yeah they

were talking to you about if we can get

more we could get through that wall so

you're saying if you were there too the

two of you combined two gemstone dragons

do you think you could bring the wall

down

how much more what type of like I would

need to know more about this wall I mean

you got me there maybe I think it did

based on what you've told me it would

take four of us hmm I don't know three

other I don't know three other daughters

of time daughters of time is what were

called I see um well what do you want to

do about this about this Lou sent the

bio silence are still sitting in the

chair like which loose end are we

talking about we have an escaped

member of the black iron correct me if

I'm wrong we have two escaped members of

the black iron pact one of which is in

ring well yeah one of them further in

ring Mel wing wing wing well well one of

them I swiped one one in ring well how

do they get in we don't know we do a

little note that said something about

double use that would W what note we

found a note by an explorer's pack one

of the we think one of like the advanced

black an iron pack dudes who was one of

the notice a do have the note there's

bringing it up who has the note do I

have to know each has it right leach sir

not appearing in this film I'm from but

you remember it certainly from what I

remember of it yes there were there were

three use one of them woods yes and it

said it said use the last one to get in

and then be sure you get out before the

door reseals because otherwise so the

one that's in might be permanently

trapped in there three WS use the first

W to get in use the last one to get out

do you know anything how you refer to as

a she how do you know it's a she

anyone's or her that got in were you

there did I say her yeah there's he said

there's that there's one that made it in

and I I don't this was this was the

group before we got there maybe oh yeah

there's a there is a dragon born night

of the Church of st. it's Bella

imminently heading towards said church

it's a I don't know we can do about that

and I mean who knows I I don't know what

what they're gonna do about it well

they're definitely gonna want ring well

I know my commander was gonna get in

touch with our spy network about this oh

it's probably too late for that

Wow silencer says how do they get in

three double use so it certainly sounds

like care too much about her blaming

hard I guess I don't get her she turns

to his other the other members of the

the other of senior members of the order

he says certainly wishes and they're

like yeah three wishes

so it seems like he's like that's almost

certainly the only magic that would that

would get them in without breaking the

seals and III think she didn't use a key

uh not that I know of

yeah it sounds like like the one that's

still in there was basically chased in

there by this Dragonborn night so you

didn't see that happen but the

Dragonborn night did yes well now I'm

more interested in this dragonburn night

uh in fact she said that she was the one

who closed the door behind the one that

went in which I think this based on ste

points to the one that's on the one

that's still sealed with the gold in the

yeah so according to that note whoever

whoever that is that's in there is super

stuck he turns he looks at the at the

moon elf and he's like if we had a wish

we could get in and nothing happens and

he goes during the name of this dragon

one night yeah lady Arosa four of the uh

uh order of the falling star Wow

we have one member of the pact in ring

well there's nothing we can do about

that right now we have someone that you

think is a spy trapped behind a

prismatic wall uh-huh and we have a

dragon this is suddenly gone from being

very simple to being very messy yeah

[Music]

well I want to talk to this Knight

he says everyone else knew it was like

yeah sounds like a good idea and

Marcella Scipio says I'll find her sir

[Music]

do you want to come with us or with me

rather we'll reconvene the group and see

if they've made any how many more about

this door the door he couldn't open the

door you said somebody got fine gold

inlaid in runes a frieze with the

history of like several the rise and

fall of several empires around it

writing in a language that I couldn't

read and technically wasn't there when

it was read well I was probably sure

asani ancient language probably running

so whoever built ring well originally

probably something that someone's a

Timecop do you tell about that I'm what

little I know of it yeah that's right

you weren't there yeah

yeah I don't this is this is so so what

can he tell you yeah if you he says I

want to talk to that night I want to

meet this woman behind the prismatic

wall this is the bottle of silencer

telling me this yeah so he's not talking

to you specifically he's talking to the

order of the Sapphire Scott yeah and he

says the room she's in is almost

certainly God blind well yeah no magic

and no magic out can't describe it

certainly certain items certain powerful

magic items that prevents crying and

prevent a divination and if those items

are destroyed and pulverized and the

pieces or the ashes or the shards of

them used to create the room then you've

got an effective no space he says the

prismatic wall is a because meant Alex

that'll work

in a god blind nothing else will nothing

else supernatural undead won't go in

there so we need a sufficiently powerful

source of psionic energy to bring it up

lady arose of our night oven he's

looking for the folder is like night of

the falling star not easy to reason with

she'll report to the head of our order

the head of her order will want to

investigate the head of her order will

want eyes on the problem before they go

to the church before they go taoist

Navarre so we have probably another

opportunity to intercept them uh and I

don't know what he's gonna say next

what are you guys telling you to do he's

like I take what you tell me about yeah

well I think you need to worry about

using the using mud and the advancers to

yup this place to show some confusion as

we need to keep this it's our job to

take care of ring well so we should be

focusing on ring well we've sent boots

to tell them about the dragon lady it's

up to them to do stuff out of the city

they can't come here and we got a we

have that other like iron packed lady

down there that we got to deal with

angels like what's across the street and

he goes and goes through the door opens

one door goes or any stands I don't have

money for Angel I should probably get

here I did once for the UH

he looks out the window and he says

what's here across the street how much

money is in the Treasury six died no a

thousand have converted to America

you've converted the cash because I

couldn't be arsed to come up with a list

of I wrote the rules for the first read

I've worked but it's contingent on

having examples of how you could use it

there's like yes I got almost four

hundred on me here he's like how much

how much how much should willing to

spend to keep this place hidden well we

should supplement it with something from

sapphire sky if we if we I'm not gonna

think what do you want I'm doing he

points to the shops along across the

street and he's like buy one of these

places just open up a dozen sausage

shops no act the sausage shop going

people know about that now just mean hi

a tailor doesn't look like they're doing

too well every but they'd sell and then

we just get a tunnel from here to there

and cover this place up no there's no

interest to ring well over here sorry

yeah

change there he checks maybe check the

next-door place yeah um he goes what's

this forty feet let's just give him ten

K to use for that and further expand the

spy network they can find some

are any of your spies are they able to

use magic yeah sure

those of you guys if you find some that

are able to use like stone shape they

can just probably escapade real quick

versus manual labor yeah of course or

you got some arrows and there's there's

a loose end well if there's one oh yeah

those are part of the spy network

doesn't mean trust them with we just

make it so some of them some of them I

trust more than others that's highly

sensitive anyway I said we would give

him cash let him upgrade the spy network

and just the rest to do this job change

I miss you think you'll need to do this

talk mm okay he's like I know he's I

gotta know he's there I need boots I

need somebody who can talk to these

folks they're not gonna listen to me but

maybe that store and he's like

identifying which doors he goes because

none of them are abandoned he's healing

to abandon shop block so now we go now

we gonna do we own these stores yeah we

handle in the hell of them yeah sure

sweet yeah I have a he's like I have

deeds they look good too trust me we'll

give him the cash he needs and well he

doesn't know how much it's gonna be he's

gonna go shave he needs to go she ate

well yeah he'll just need to talk with

two-shoes to get the cash out yeah

that's fine well just write a thing that

says I don't use give it up yeah yeah

this place what's their money on paper

yeah yeah yeah that's right because I

can get one of those boots can go on

those people to sell because we got more

than of money to buy any of these stores

it's just a question of whether or not

they'll sell they sell and we just keep

the employees in place we just replace

the boss the owner with somebody maybe

I'll find somebody will play the honor

for us they'll even think they're the

owner who cares not tell them they

inherited this place they won't know any

better

they will know they were actually

working for us well you know if they

don't sell I'm sure you can find a way

to make him wanna leave

and they wouldn't they won't even know

wait hang on a minute and he walks out

and he stands

in the middle of the street and he looks

down he looks up at you guys to the

window and he's like there was a sewer

grating in the middle of the place and

he opens the sewer grating he goes down

the sausage stand and then I don't make

it and then a few moments later his head

pops up over here like a few minutes

later mmm his head pop seven he goes I

think it's easier than that hmm all

right it was I think I just saved us

that's 40 feet and maybe 6,000 roll so

just remove all that rinses and we use

this yeah he goes I think there's a way

into the he goes there's definitely a

way into the sewer okay I love this show

it is it is 817 and I very badly need a

bio break so we are going to take an

impromptu break and come back in about

13 minutes yes a little early but needs

must when the devil drives I believe we

are a little light on fan art but

there's at least one person one piece of

fan art I'm looking forward to showing

off this is the point where we say

thanks for sticking around those few who

hang out after the break we realize that

unless you're on the west coast which

who is then it's late right now so

thanks for hanging out and sticking

around thanks to our mods who do a

tremendous job helping us maintain our

awesome community we're all incredibly

proud of the community we have it's

super cool and if you want to support to

this content obviously you know if

you're an Amazon Prime subscriber you

get a free twitch Prime subscription you

can throw to your favorite streamer

whenever you want if you want to support

us more directly obviously you can go to

our patreon where for instance if you

are a backer at any level on a patreon

you can see the stats for Lady Rose

apart that I threw together using the

method I came up with with a black iron

pact which is I think a lot more

straightforward and easier to run than

the monsters in the monster manual while

at the same time giving them lots of

cool abilities to use obviously also

there's strongholds and followers and

our dope ass t-shirt which is available

for purchase and now let's check out

what we got people like

old slim oh really how could you not

love some people so cute oh that's right

this is that's awesome so good I love

this stuff

there was someone the guy who does the

sweet cosplay was at GenCon yeah that's

some like straight David Bowie this

is butts this is this is the artist who

drew this painting herself to look like

butts but that really actually is quite

a lot like what people have drawn butts

to look blonde or whatever but says not

blonde but basically looks like that

yeah happy with that art it's so

exciting this Harry Caray expression is

like really cute it was like oh that's

super butts because that's very close to

the canonical butts when last we left

our heroes we were in the process of

boots explaining to the secret society

of the Sapphire sky what the hell's

going on in ring well it's they're

somewhat confused by the information

coming out of boots only because there's

a lot of it and it goes together in a

very specific order meanwhile back here

in the abandoned candle shop next to the

butcher's shop at the chain of a crowd

have occupied and sort of infiltrated

with their own people the chain are

trying to figure out what to do about

the fact that Lady Rose 'var is gonna go

tell her boss what the hell is going on

down here an angel who's the head of the

chain of macarons spy network wants to

know what he what if anything he should

do and he is he has offered to go subdue

the probably by slipping her something

in a drink and getting her to pass out

and then take her unconscious body back

here to ring well or there may be a

place where they could put her where no

one could find her even using powerful

scrying

mad

but the officers of the chain aren't

sure if that's a good idea

and we're to pick up the action with

angel wanting to know what to do what

are your orders boss well you found the

manhole that's right normal word manhole

sewer that's the reason we had to take a

break anyway yeah so Angel has a plan

via which he can get you can press the

advancers which are your elite Scouts

led by mud into service they have

experience as sappers and what is that

word you give us sappers under might

like you dig literally under miners yeah

like sappers our sappers typically go

underground not very far underground

very shallow they dig very shallow

tunnels and then they plant either

explosives or they divert water in order

to cause the walls of a castle to

collapse so you've got the in the middle

of a siege and you don't want to sit

outside this castle for the next three

months and starve them out so you under

the cover of night

typically you send in your sappers and

your sappers start digging a tunnel far

enough away that they can't be seen and

they can't be hit by catapults and

whatnot and the sappers go to diggy

diggy hole diggy hole diggy deal and

then depending on what century are in

they have their plant explosives they

divert a river or just digging

underneath the castle walls can be

enough to cause the castle let's go and

I can get it so they have answers they

have experiences sappers and they can

probably just with the sheer manpower

start digging holes start filling in

some of these tunnels so that these

these places won't lead anywhere and the

one entrance that angel found in the

sewer can become the way in hmm one of

the things that we kind of discussed

offhandedly was well if Lady Dragon

Knight comes back with her crew yeah

obviously they're gonna want to go into

ring well and to see what's going on so

if they can find the entrance we can

kind of use

them to start clearing a path as we like

follow along basically like let them do

the heavy lifting and then take him out

or something like that whenever the time

comes if we need to yeah was that you

was that he was Slim's boots

somebody's I'm not there she's saying

the viewers missed yeah was discussion

outside where somebody I don't know if

it was said we could just let the

following star the Knights of the

following star exploring well yeah and

then wait until their wait until they're

about to like they have them take on the

brunt of the risk and then just as

they're about to find something or take

something that we don't want them to

then we jump you let that let the iron

golem take care of him right yeah they

can fall down the hole this time yeah

let them diggy diggy hole they're gonna

go straight for the black our impact

lady though well they can but we ready

they can try yeah I mean the dragon

lady's explicitly said the bishop can

take care of that wall and then we jump

in there and we go ah surprise

every course it's not going after her

then with angel right we're just gonna

let her go yeah well they're gonna come

back at some point well not if angel

gozen back sir yeah that's true

you want me to go get that lady I'll

bring that lady back here later and

maybe drugger

I'll draw her don't worry I'll take care

of that I'll have my people do it

bring her unconscious body back here

drop her in that that anti-magic place

you tell me about and then no one can

find her maybe do a short way well I

like we need to give her to the Sapphire

sky first she knows more about the

people in there and she sealed the doors

so if anything we need to get her at

least a hander to the Sapphire sky get

information from her whoever they don't

want I think the water then will you'll

do what you do best okay so what am i

our just

use the network to grab her sure thing

boss so anyway back at the back of the

pocket universe that the order of the

Sapphire sky so very cute yeah the vowel

silencer says you just need a

sufficiently powerful source of sound

again of psionic energy and you'll be

able get through that wall rat

presumably the emperor had such a thing

and there might even be one somewhere in

ring the key to that room might be

somewhere in ring well but it'll be

beyond that door so the question is how

do we get through this door yeah well I

think the I think the lady behind the

wall has information on that she didn't

seem too keen to talk to us unless we

were gonna be able to spring her from

that trap so I think if we if we bring a

means to do that to the table you know

then we'll get to know what she knows

[Music]

all right well the chain of Akron have

proven to be the allies that we were

looking for you found ring well where we

couldn't it seems as though you're on in

the middle of a race now between us and

the black iron pack and now potentially

this church of Saint Isabella or the

Knights of the falling star I think we

might have some time there I mean it's

gonna take them it's gonna take them a

minute to organize and get back here

well the the the Knights of the falling

star are a minor order even if this

night you're speaking of goes to the

head of her order and reports back the

head of order wrong take action and then

depending on what the head of our order

says he looks around and says I don't

know what that is and then all the other

all the other wizards and knights in

here like we don't yet then there's a

whole hierarchy it could take you know

who knows how long before the head of

the church decides to look into it

so we can we may be able to do something

there but we need to know how to get

through that door without without a W

which is almost certainly a wish

yeah well there there were other avenues

that we that we hadn't explored on that

same level we ran into an iron golem and

you know I almost killed it by myself

but we had to get out there almost

killed it by yourself oh we get him um I

mean they can they can see what

condition I'm in I'm sure I look like

ass right now you know he'll do nothing

there well you know I'm at least yeah to

exhaust you haven't you haven't you

haven't had a long rest yeah he's like

well what are you one of the rescue team

doing well when I left him lady arose of

are just left the small abandoned candle

shop that we had holed up in outside of

the entrance to bring well I imagine

that they've been talking to talking to

our spymaster trying to you know figure

out some way to intercept intercept turn

follower capture her something is there

anything that boots well yeah it would

be a somewhat somewhat blanket statement

may be fair to ask what about this rod

do you found here well it came from some

centuries-old vampire lord that tried to

take over the take over some generation

of the caelian empire guys the eight

vampire Lord is it evil uh almost

certainly yeah well then we want it and

then Marcellus Scipio says

Oh Lord do we and they are they have a

little debate about what to do about the

stuff you guys recover from and the bio

science aside need I remind you of our

Charter and he points to the Moon elf

and he says but if the if something like

this rod is better used in the hands of

the chain I mean they might use it where

we would and the viol silence is like I

hadn't considered that there may be

benefits to employing a group of

ethically ambiguous mercenaries yeah

well I mean that's that's kind of how we

got ahold in the first place was that me

oh you know I'm afraid I know ethnic

ambiguity did have to heal somebody to

get it no well well the less said the

better the less I know about your

nefarious dealings the better I think

it's yeah it's that kind of situation

well we'll see if there's anything we

can do here on our end to handle the

nights of the falling star we have our

own resources yours might be your

network might be stronger than ours like

the I don't know how he would put it

like he doesn't have we don't have as

many agents as you folks to write well

um they don't have a spy network or

anything like that

do I have any way of contacting you guys

here when I'm back in the mundane world

they look age they look at each other

and they're like and they point out

Marcela Scipio and he's like come to the

mistral all right I'm trying to think if

this there's any I don't have any like

nice sword oh thank you silencer says

where'd you get it another is that

another recovered award like the rod

came from the black I unpacked my seal

he looks at and he says and now you use

this yeah

okay and hands about you see that what

does that mean well I think you knew it

was a race when we started it just means

now that the race is well underway

so the faster we find out how to get

through this door better yeah well we're

soon as I get back there I'll let him

know I'll let him know what went down

here and um and I think we were just

gonna we were gonna rest up and head

right back down into ring well well then

don't let us keep you all right and

Marcella Scipio puts his ring on the

table and with its bends and then he

snatches it and when he snatches at

you're back in the alley all right I

will disguise myself again and uh thank

you mr. Skippy Oh as you're walking off

to head back to here or ring well in

whichever Marcello says boots yeah be

careful what you tell the vile silencer

Oh

the more he knows the more he has to act

on sometimes ignorance is better and I

suppose that goes for me too

understood good luck thank you all

I'll contact you again when I've got

something I don't know if it was clear

but I think the bile silencer was really

impressed oh well good I'm glad he seems

he seems a good fellow he's been

fighting this war for a long time

good doesn't begin to describe it all

right well so angel will you rejoin

these yeah

and I'm gonna assume that they do brief

you on the orders they've given angel

group actually angels probably still and

yeah I wasn't gone that long well I mean

he's probably gonna wait for you because

he thinks of you as the as the head like

as the head of the spy network

it's your roles they're gonna get him

out together gonna determine with

another six teaser fields so this is an

espionage action all right is this

you're gonna roll a 20-sided die and

you're gonna add the level of your spy

network which is - and your proficiency

modifier and the DC you do not know but

it's based on how hard the enemy is to

spy on and things you do know is if they

have a if they have a spy network there

they're much harder to spy on than if

they don't mm-hmm right um it can be

very easy mmm espionage actions well I

thought we were just disguising the okay

I went with angel after the Dragonborn

Oh in addition to yeah right we're

stupid using me you know we'll use the

advancers to take care of disguise yeah

so they're a smaller organization they

probably don't have a spy network well

they're also the church so we could we

would think right you guys all you got

it depends on it depends on if you fail

and how much you fail by because if you

fail by quite a lot

and it's possible that the other

organizations besides the one you're

trying to operate against find out

what's going on you're not you're not

trying to stop the church the church is

a massive organization you would

probably fail you're trying to stop

you're trying to stop the order of the

following star just four guys around to

an obscure order of knights

now as the Sapphire sky said they're

gonna tell their boss their boss is

gonna investigate their boss is gonna

tell their and then at that point once

it jumps out that now there's a larger

issue but you're not there yet right so

role well spy master don't worry you do

don't uh don't let it soak under 20 in

your box yeah but I'm like something

else 17 okay well you'll find out you'll

find out what happens in some number of

hours maybe maybe it might take a little

longer what are you folks gonna do in

the meantime

angels the angel angels like okay boss

angel good luck man Luck's got nothing

to do with it he takes off if if you

fail make it look like the black iron

pack did it mm-hmm that's uh that's a

higher difficulty glass shop gave us the

Rings sprinkle some black iron with some

of the ring yeah we do it's like this

one's been used we have a new unused

ring we do can just someone has an

unused one well what happens is I mean

he'll try it it'll take us back round

see look see what I can do here though

we did get an unusual one yeah we

thought we found one unused yeah

oh yeah that's right I've got it sir or

it's a good thing that Driscoll's not

here

[Laughter]

which is the air the air yeah I know

that one of us took yeah some of the

unused one so I'll give that one to

Angel I mean I just I don't think I did

you cut the ones off the other guys yeah

yeah I seem to recall we found two extra

rings one of them is the one Anna has

and one of them look like the other

thing yeah sure I thought you had

because you showed us the lady

[Music]

someone just rewatch you know I'll have

someone on chat fast-forward through

three hours of us okay yeah we we

definitely found one though so you know

[Music]

yeah if it's if it's me I'll give it to

him if it's somebody else oh well if you

want to give angel the unused ring he

can well actually actually uh yeah well

how'd that even work I'll put it on

though yeah cuz especially because like

black iron PAC knows that those rings

get attached to fingers so it's like

unless you had like a finger there but

there's no Bowl it's kind of like the

cyanide pill if you're going down I'll

put it on write that bill for a spy if

you're gonna looting a cop they ya know

angel doesn't angel

he says if I he was if we failed and it

was ideally no one will know anything

happen we just won't work okay yeah

right I just

he goes I just have to hope that she's

real thirsty and needs a drink before

she report saying she's been too hot

seems a safe bet yep angel takes off

I'll take first watch dad yes but I can

go he was gonna spend the night here

about half an hour after you guys prep

your watches and get everything set up

in here to be your camp mud comes in

with the with like five of the green

boots five of the advancers and you

should be resting though so you get your

short rest at least for sure okay so we

do have to throw down okay I mean I

thought okay I'll do the short rest and

you should start the rest do you guys

have any unrest yeah guys gonna love you

don't have to worry about fighting about

changing your behavior in order to

ensure assurance was that it's used now

is refreshed wellness you have two

different shades one no I just

presidents actually I'm so I moved my I

move my Bartok inspiration to be

adjacent to my sword college abilities

so I wouldn't forget to mark off in

Spode I could do a yeah sword maneuver

mmm-hmm yeah so mud and the advancers

show up and they've got packs with a lot

of like digging equipment and they start

filing through and they're gonna start

trying to make it so that the ways down

in here no longer go down yeah it's

gonna take a while has a lot of work but

there's like xxx answers so they will

slowly be filing in and yet you you

folks it is nighttime you're able to

spend the night yeah so you guys are

able to spend hit dice you were you I'm

sorry you don't spend advice you recover

all your hip points and recover half you

are spent hit nice so if you spent to

hit dice you recover one if you spent

three you still recover one if you spent

four you recover two all uh I'll take a

stone shape today okay it's a fourth

little spell I look wow really yeah

you're gonna spend stuff Oh interesting

well fair enough well what do you I'm

taking off spirit Guardians and doing

stone shape for tomorrow your ancestors

will be happy to have the day off

mmm-hmm the night pass is uneventful the

other than the sound of digging jerry is

typing yeah and you guys because it's

relatively early you guys were able to

take your long rest and you'll be up

before dawn the next day sweet all right

let's do it

get back in there excellent yeah shall

we is there anything else we need to do

up top before we go back down maybe we

should have shown angel the stuff that I

drew and the Chronicle from the wall so

start looking this booth and just more

information to have I give the mud to

give to him you said it would be some

number of hours I assume it hasn't been

that number of hours hear anything from

Angel o6r Janna do you guys take

Watchmen here heard you saw yourself

well I had mentioned that I would stay

up first and then he said you're not

there's not any danger of no I'm done

there was no danger of you guys being

interrupted well he told me he totally

sleeps for four hours so same with butts

I believe his butts is a half but beats

just meditates for four hours so he's

awake unless he's just sitting there but

I can leave them with the instructions

to uh give me the information from angel

if he gets me so two people you don't

recognize come in through the door I

guess yeah three people to whom you

don't recognize come in through the door

and they appear to be real ones who have

been out carousing and between them

apparently drunk and passed out is lady

erosive are

and they're like our friend here passed

out and we were told that she lives here

does she live here oh you brought her

home thank you thank you so much we'll

take good take take good care of her

she unload her and they kind of look

around like what exactly is going on

here and one looks like we don't know

what's going on here and they're like

your folks have a good night

honey you know soldiers right like work

up a mighty thirst sometimes yeah yeah

well we're gonna go finish off uh-huh

yeah and then they split enjoy so yeah

Lady Rose Amar's not drunk she has been

drugged yeah she's maybe she's been

quite successfully not nice boy

so are we taking her down there or we

get nerd sapphire sky that's all right

so they can talk to her I assume you

told us that while silencer wants to

talk to her yeah we also want to talk to

the lady behind the prismatic wall

speaking of the prismatic wall your

doesn't your psycho crystal recharge

after a long rest

yep so no you have how many charges as

far as I know 12 got it doesn't I don't

remember what size of your crystal you

have medium yeah I don't really want

this loose end to go any further but

that's they said we need four and this

would be to at least if they can

convince her otherwise

I wonder if she part of the moon Oh like

what are they gonna do with her

afterwards are they just gonna like let

her go and then we deal with her again

Rosa farts flying on the ground she's

like drooling should I try and well we

should probably I mean we'll play okay

well that was her waking up no she's not

she's just she's breathing

you know what is the third person part

of that group so she's gonna have the

information

a rose bar has sorry say it again so the

lady who's stuck down there was the

third person with that group and right

he's gonna have the information that a

rose bar has so yeah yeah no it's gonna

help us get the wards I mean do you want

to just like that's tough night table

night books so or there's all the black

iron packed people down there she spot

some of them it will probably be pretty

easy to set up a scene we take this with

my iron pack guys put him in that magic

room mm-hmm

I'm sure we've done stuff well I have

you know I'm sure actually I'm sure

angels done this sort of thing before I

probably help out with it so it probably

makes sense that yeah angel comes with

us and sets at the scene

yep so what are you planning on doing

King what is not responding I do have no

alarms discussing with the group about

asking on behalf of alchemy to King's

asleep right now since he took first

watch waiting for Angel but well then we

don't hear anything you're saying yeah I

think like completely asleep yeah you

guys are definitely awake now that Lady

Rose afar has been brought along rest

we've all harrell and rest this is in

the middle of the night this happens but

you guys will have your long rest by

then this is not I can't place this

before I can't do what i lured the ohad

king would do so pinky finger and burn

up for next

no that's Seward and that's because my

sibling trying to you who's not good

guys it was not good

we've got this black diamond ring Oh

what if we just put the ring on her and

just plant or you know like you're the

intern alleyway behind a bar somewhere

you know oh she can't go back to her

church right or like it's just gonna

yeah she's complicated

yeah we yeah either either we're going

the plan that we talked about earlier

about the the godless rooms or we're

handing our cheese black iron pack back

to the that we definitely saw I think

the 2nd the sight of all the cockamamie

plans we've seen I think the second one

sounds like the wiser choice today

really that feels Messier to me no

because well the vowel silencer said I

want to talk about yeah because like the

only thing say you want to talk that

night is because there are details about

what happened that you got that you guys

didn't see it she knows and he they want

to know like how did that person get in

wishes Sherman how but what exactly when

you say you close the door describe this

door to me at that guy stuff yeah dinner

if you get her there before she wakes up

she doesn't even know that she doesn't

even need to know that we were ever

involved mm-hmm in her that's a good

point and uh uh it was a good point I

think that's worth inspiration to to

that point to that point you know if and

when she makes it back from their little

pocket dimensions will have changed all

the entrances and well let's so yeah the

point King wouldn't marry this person so

let's give them to the Sapphire sky and

we have to hope they're going to they're

going to do we need to find civilian

they'll do what's in their best

interests well we hope so I know that if

they release her again something

happened well let's at least make sure

that she's properly found and

blindfolded so that we can try to remain

as part of whatever is going on here and

then you you do yourself is pretty dope

like when you if you play back

everything that's happened yeah

it's pretty cool like sending angel go

bagger you guys rolled well we can't dis

guy

well can we disguise her mm-hmm yeah

somebody should be going to get Scipio

right now yes yeah I think we should or

bring him to her us yes yeah that's what

I'm saying yeah so you can you can go

ahead and stealth that helps a scipio

stealth back here I see that nice you

think up pretty good anyway so who's

gonna go it's copper gonna be disguised

as a gob copper King offers a bobgoblin

copper can't copper can stop their

copper can't really hmm

yeah God he can slip there yeah so you

gotta go

we're on the clock all right and we can

have leach you know keep her sedated I'm

gonna Begaren and tie up so if she can't

move and she hopefully can't see

anything myself sac over the head yes

darkness silence and hold personnel

usual yeah we give her the old Saturday

night I don't really have like silence

that I can discuss I could just put her

in like a corner in silence the corner

like you just stay over there

so copper how are you gonna you're gonna

head over to the dancing minstrel and

make contact with so it's it's it's

barely dawn it's it's it's that the Sun

hasn't yet come up with the sky is

lightning it's cold how it's cold

morning here in Rioja whatever the hell

time of year it is I'm not sure about

man if I were a better Dungeon Master

I'd probably know I gotta figure bread

clock is always ticking I don't always

know what the clock says it's for Perl

17 no I know the days of the week I know

the REO and days of the week but I don't

know the months so yeah it's it's too

like scipios not there there's uh a

there's no one in the common room but

the doors are open and there are the

people who run the place are

kind of taking chairs off the off the

tables and setting things up for

breakfast there's the bartender you've

met and dealt with before

mm-hmm and go up and ask him well I

assume is there like is this like in

yeah it's a multistory in this is the

common room and there are stairs up

there are two floors or actually I think

they're three floors of rooms okay here

the dancing okay so the room she's

staying I don't think you know yeah ask

him this end we do we he's not the the

big giant guy right that's the Kings the

King's footstool we crashed here after

the angel fight and we got approached by

Scipio here okay yeah so yeah we haven't

done like apart from meeting Scipio and

I guess the minstrel you guys haven't

done any role-playing here right but you

could like eaten the meal yeah this

guy's not gonna just tell me where he

likes my he wouldn't have told me uh I

don't know that he would have given any

more specific direction he wouldn't

hidden it wouldn't in it from you but I

think he just assumes that you know you

would just leave a message with if you

were because he's still in school by the

way

and so he still has stuff he's not he's

not here 24 hours a day this is

important yeah yes he has a he has

a facade to maintain it's like isn't the

weekend

it's that turned day rises at the

weekend I mean he's here I'm not saying

he's not here I'm sick as hell I'm

saying he's not in the comment in the

room I'll go up and ask the innkeeper

huh son keep her since oh my god nice uh

nice hat thank you

from some organization who you with

you know - yeah yeah he tells you where

Scipio Germans always here okay yeah

he's asleep

most of our rooms are sold out yeah this

goblins gonna bust it otherwise asleep

like he's on the third floor which is

the expensive floor okay okay it's

appearances students right see on the

most expensive floor noble family

somebody who can afford someone who can

afford to attend the war colleges and

you occasionally as you go up the stairs

those three flights of stairs that

you're going up and people are waking up

and they're going downstairs and they're

like oh when they see this table and you

know some of them just are like and

ignore you and then you can't you come

to the room that is they're not there

when they give you when they tell you

what room they're in it's like okay go

up three flights of stairs and then turn

out and it's the third one down it's not

they're numbered or anything like that

and so you follow the directions that

the innkeeper gave you and and there's a

there's a door no give the handle yeah

no handle opens yeah there's a as soon

as you open the door there's a smell of

like alcohol mmm yeah it's you have to

if you go in I'll see that he's passed

out and that like and he's all kind of

tangled up in the in the sheets just

sleeping the windows open it's cool in

gets up and he's got though though the

sheet wrapped around him huh

[Laughter]

I just talked to boots last night is

the chest of drawers here and he goes

through and he finds he's got like just

stuffed clothes in here college kid yep

perfect make a persuasion check no one's

gonna notice what he's wearing his

silver and said get all the big cat fool

8:8 yeah he's like no I can't wait hang

makes sure that he's wearing he is a

Centurion outfit is what's saluted

around the room he doesn't put out he

dresses like normal real

his face me he's like alright let's go

okay and he follows you back here and

he's like where what happened so I'm not

gonna see you not allowed we got we got

what we're looking for now okay good

whew I mean I mean the lady behind the

wall or the lady from the ladies from

the so yeah he follows you he followed

you down and he's see shows up here and

he and he comes in and now it's light

it's and it's you know it's daylight

like 6:30 morning and you can hear

traffic this is a very rarely used

alleyway but there's definitely Street

traffic now and Marcellus Scipio who

just saw you last night basically mm-hmm

is like the chain of a cron why is she

gonna though we don't want him to know

that we're involved in this next part it

says yeah that's definitely mercenaries

here's your man wants to talk to her and

we gotta go back downstairs so we need

your out of our yeah you need to take

her to Anton I want to say Arcas over

but that's names during our vow silencer

yeah how's answer is a title yeah Darren

gar Darren for sure yeah if you want it

wouldn't that wouldn't seem like a weird

nickname Tim um we're gonna go try to

figure out the lady behind the wall and

more ring well scipio this again you

folks act fast like I just talked to

boots last night about this and this NAT

hasn't even eight hours I put C takes

his ring off his finger puts his hand on

the kind of drooling hooded bound figure

and then he looks at you and then looks

at you and says it could have killed her

but he didn't why not well boots told us

that the rel silencer wanted to question

her and we know we need more gemstone

Dragonborn to bring down that wall also

messy yes may I be discreet

and hey man we're good people sometimes

she's not our enemy after or glory and

healing an unconscious yeah so I agree

everybody else said no well you did not

say a word

get out of here like he takes the hood

off that when you say out there he Peaks

under the hood and says you're good

sometimes I'd hate to see you when

you're bad and he flips the coin and it

goes and then he reaches to grab it I

don't think any of you folks have seen

this happen he reaches out to grab it in

the hand lady Arkansas guard disappear

in a flash of cerulean light yeah I

guess we haven't seen it from the

outside you only victims on it neat Rosa

warka so far I know cuz cuz you said our

cuz over yeah I don't know where I got

that but somebody said it he's still out

there he's still defending Castle rent

oh that's his boy oh yeah and I think he

just probably still alive

or I should say he just character all

right so you guys

you folks have delivered you guys have

successfully kidnapped drugged and

so you're a spy network successfully

drugged and kidnapped a knight of the

church delivered her back into your good

graces where she was bound and blinded

with a hood you summoned your contacts

in the sapphire sky they showed up and

have a teleport on her into their realms

so they will deal with her whatever that

means and your your advance scouts

part-time sappers are in the process of

reconfiguring the underground here so

that you can't so that that stairs down

just leads to the basement nowhere else

and this trapdoor doesn't lead anywhere

they're going to move the trapdoor I'm

super interested in what's going to

happen in another world but I will

probably write that up as a cutscene

posted for folks to read because I

already know what the Sapphire sky are

going to do what are you folks gonna do

where's your Mac and people people some

people worry people were some of the

people who watch the car show

astonishingly there are that there are

people who do that we're afraid that

ring well was going to be the end of

politics in the game wake me up when

they're back to the politics

dungeon-crawling

and it's like this is from my point of

view this is on the order of you guys

trying to get out of the library and not

getting a fight with the twelve right

had you identified the staff in the rod

the rod use it I know things that that

other judges was it it's just that we

can summon the vampiric myths and stuff

well it does it does other stuff that we

has what is job because what did judge

tell the group that the rod to do this

summons blood miss George says yeah this

is the source of the blood mist yeah

some percent it's alright it's not my

place to judge but yet what is Leeds

doing knows the P sock the paper sound

of company just good by the way it says

good luck to him dude I'm thought he was

think so I think he is good actually

there's no D I think he's chaotic good

or something like that

yeah well because he was he was told to

do something evil and refused and that's

how he got that's how he got ballast and

tracks as his patron no I told you he

knows that I don't think he does well he

might say not I've put two two together

but he definitely he definitely has

known he may have forgotten definitely

he's probably drunk it's forgotten

already

yeah if it doesn't have his uh Johnny

flashes I mean die flash and Lord rock

revival

oh he's not chatting dog says he's not

gonna fight he's probably passed down

yeah okay I thank you it was in Vegas

for like those past six months

well he's probably on a plane by now

baby maybe he's probably in cargo it's

kind of good I don't know he might be

neutral buddy I think he's on the way

too

it's not all he was reading is certainly

please character sheet I snuck into the

Bengal correct commander pepper is

correct leech leech knows that his

patrons balance and tracks OD has

probably forgotten or if maybe maybe

miss mmm in the mists of time he has

reconfigured the information so he no

longer can put it the other crazy

there was at least one point that I

distinctly remember where he put

everything together and I was like oh I

get it

he is he's neutral I told you I'm

presenting if one of this is not good

tell he's not good already like when do

I get to medium again it's not mine

because mine's in the thing i

double-checked because I was like why

the is my dice out that's the same

set anyway if one of us hangs on to that

rod be able to attune to it if yeah

those mists just a paper no more if I

could attuned to it they weren't it's a

map with notes everything they weren't

terribly I mean they weren't tough so

huh you know they weren't too bad yeah I

think it'd be worth me with a couple

more of them there's more to it - I know

I don't know the full extent of it

unless I can tune - if you want to see

them players map you can set your way I

said give it up check Twitter pass let

me let me hold it another touch my rod

so jeez judge asking King for the rod of

count I'm missing like if I'm attune to

it I can there's more to that rod

there's more that he can do but I don't

know enough from it just from

identifying it King this was actually

the sapphire skies idea they know we

have that rod and they know that it's

it's a better use to us down there than

it is to them I know your up in

the town that bullshitting not

bullshitting like oh that's a that's a

28 to persuade you to give judge the

rock we were now entering dangerous

territory

the the players start trying to use

their skills against me and my rule is

that if you if your character is trying

to persuade another if your player

character is trying to persuade another

player character of borrowing using

magic on them the only option you have

is actually pursuing them not rolling

dice

I only vote because you roll I know I

know I know I rolled inside as a joke

yeah I know I know I know you guys but I

was I was in I was in fear that you're

screwing around was about to become real

so I am alerting you to the reality so

is King not gonna let judge a tubular

Roger figure out what else I can do okay

we let me attune to the road she what

she's not gonna attack us like what

yeah no reason tears I'm not chaotic ah

are you aware of that demon sword that

has a mind of its own which I have also

know there's no wins

[Music]

yes I won oh

the demon sword hold on let's let's give

drugs remembered so that when the demon

sword takes over it can go haha and

out of us yeah

so can I hang on to it then not right

now let me get out of here commander but

I'm the webmaster it's not a weapon it's

stuff the magic staff are you the magic

webmaster no anyways what says I'll use

it no buts it exploded you that was just

the ward yeah I'm pretty sure that what

let's hold it anyways let's continue

let's try this iron golem again

where the other direction there's

multiple we did the inner rings right I

said well we're so we're this is what

iron golem us yeah let's go the other

way I've gone this way so he goes

we're not gonna go don't forget lady

Olympia still down there I mean you know

the hunger she gets the more she might

be interested in talking so well stop

and say hi

should we see if she's still it's alive

yeah she's there she she is yeah you can

you can see from outside that the

prismatic wall is still up and she's

sitting against the far wall of it and

she's kind of laying her head back yes

didn't your eyes are closed

Oh resting should I try and cut through

this thing now that my crystals to

recharge is it fully charged yes for as

far as I know I'm reading the

description here and it just says it

recharges after a long rest

oh and it takes like four chargers under

the five to do those four charges out of

the twelve twelve it's for the strongest

thing that you can do with it there are

some other things but it's the thing

will do the most damage

um did boots tell us about the gemstone

Dragonborn in the sapphire sky about

them possibly joining us to help us try

to break open the prismatic wall oh my

good I would have at least told you guys

that yeah bit like you know the there

guy who was a gemstone Dragonborn mm-hmm

would have said Phil you roll a d6 every

day I roll with these things yeah I'm

curious what the equivalent of that is

music dragon like if that's one dragon

worth well cuz I was wondering like if

we should wait to see your virus guys

know send their boy down yeah that's a

white port now if this is an equivalent

of like a dragon or two dragons then we

have so I have nine charts okay still

that's still pretty good enough all

right Oh cuz you roll it's beginning of

every day right over that many right

it's not for every longer it might be

wasting it you can always give it a shot

see what does it gives us more

information and he still has one more

use of it without breaking his uh mm-hmm

just she hears you folks talking and she

opens her eyes and stands up so you

wanna give me a shot can yep what's your

evidence all right what was that mean

was that was me powering up my sword oh

you're using a some charges to it cast

amplify drag yet on my sword and so

Slim's the slim slim short sword is

sheathed in this coruscating rainbow

energy not entirely unlike like the

Bifrost from the Thor movies and slim I

assume enters the room mm-hm and Lady

Vol ntsc's your sword and says good luck

doesn't it doesn't go out or anything

like that

oh no I'd say like if she's gonna tell

you know like psionic powers working

here they just don't penetrate the wall

your your psionic abilities like when

you use misty step mmm you ended up you

couldn't get into the water at it like

skips the wall it skips the space so

there's all the holes big enough like

she try to come through right like

that's that's the goal here just like

open a hole and then yeah I'm thinking

that shatters or something I don't know

I wasn't really me like the thing

whenever it was important did it and it

basically was just like a hole that just

like yay big like if you do it if it's

like if it can like rent like a seam or

something that she always try to get

through before it closes or something

like that

mm-hm we're just seeing what happens I'm

like I guess my I might get all

jacked up again oh yeah I'll find out

yeah we'll see all right take a swing at

this thing and your minds instantly go

back to yesterday when you some of you I

think actually you too you've got you

folks didn't to King and boots go back

to a very similar scene where a lady

arose of are hacked at this thing over

and over again with her some word did no

good

slim you know dances forward and hacks

into the wall and there's definitely

some interference between the sword and

the energy of the wall you see the wall

shimmer it called it glows brighter

where slim sort hits it and then that

brightness kind of goes like bounces

around the wall but it doesn't penetrate

it

so from your point of view it feels like

you just hit a rock wall yeah right now

may your it doesn't your your sword is

still it lasts for the duration you're

sort of still sheath and energy right

but it does not appear to I wonder if it

was like you should have like we should

have put the crystal directly to the

thing and then try to use the dragon

lady yeah no that were well we're

working another angle of this wall and

we'll be back enjoy your nap ahem she

says given enough time I think it's

almost certain that my agents will get

me out of here but I'd rather not wait

what is it the chain of Acheron or doing

die let's negotiate trying to stop the

block tire impact from claiming the

things that are down here like our

impact our cult what is the chain care

about it called they were there Ajax yes

that's right I've read the broadsheets

the chain of Akron wants to stop ajax

ajax be invincible

hey Jack the iron st. I mean those are

just words his words yeah and how much

can you trust him well trust him I don't

know but bet against him I would did you

know that his wizard studied here in the

city I think we did

we know that you know I know he's shy no

Ajax then yeah always wizard did too

well that's kind of I think what we'd

assume right has all the big powerful

magical users tend to go to the college

or than whatever here where did he study

the world college a sorcerer under

prince al arash mm-hmm interesting are

you willing to tell us at this point who

your agents are well I'm certainly

willing to reward you for freeing and

there are many people in the city who

would give almost everything some to be

out of my debt and some to be in to it

can you tell us what you're doing as

being part of the black are in fact I

was doing a favor for someone mm was it

not tied to your organization not

directly but we are also interested in

in Ajax and his operation in what way

[Music]

well there are a lot of people in the

city who are eager to oppose him and we

felt I felt then if we could get ahead

of the game there we could trade in a

lot of favors so are you hoping to get

some of the artifacts in this area to

further that cause well I didn't know

anything about ring well I was surprised

as anybody else that this place exists

but I was certainly interested in what

the black iron packed were up to how

long have you been an infiltrator oh I

was only driven to this desperation four

days ago

wow they trust easy

I have you know they trusted lady if he

lent you ah okay mm-hmm good references

we have we investigated this room much

more yeah like if we looked for a super

switch on the wall lunch like that

there's a door that lead up the other

way to room that has can we need to read

any of the symbols any other symbols I'm

sorry I was just saying the symbols in

this room no I thought there was like a

Rundlett there's a there's a there's a

circle of warding that is generating the

prismatic wall and the walls themselves

are sparkly correct but otherwise their

mark their marble or their granite like

stands that have they're not they're not

sandstone the walls in here are granite

and they have flecks of something

glittering in them that the light

catches them every once in a while so as

you walk around the sort of sparkle this

is that's the subunit monthly despot

well they're doing that now talking to

them well well well I've still got the

energy on my sword yeah wanna try just

like chopping at the floor or like

around the around the glowing area yeah

it doesn't I mean it or denier it it

doesn't do anything it's like doesn't

say like a floor not really no I mean it

scratches it but it doesn't it doesn't

cut through the floor right okay worth a

try I feel like undermine endures yeah

it's not like if the ring I feel certain

yeah it's bad way that my organization

can help yours whenever we get you out

of here are you gonna go back to joining

rejoining the iron factor is your this

guy's kind of broken at this point I

don't think they would trust Lydia

Valencia again so if I wanted to if I

wanted to continue to spy on the pact I

would have to subvert another of their

agents and replace them

are you using some kind of discs is

speller ability in order to take over

that person's role she one of the

faceless man well no she's um

appearances can be deceiving that's

there's the mask of many faces well

maybe if we could get in touch you know

if we could get in touch with your

organization in such a way candidly

asked to sort of facilitate breaking you

out here it seems like we've got some

overlapping interests we could be of use

to one another can you communicate with

your organization while you're in there

or is the anti-magic also inside that

chamber I have to rely on my

organization's resources but your

organization doesn't know you're in here

so if they were to if I were to know

then maybe they have some means to get

this thing open

we've done some tests and this entire

chamber it can't be

they might there might be at the ability

to scry into it perhaps but we know now

that like gods can't see into here so if

that's what you're relying on that work

it's your investigation night - lo mine

my invitation I don't know if we've

actually like investigated the room I

don't remember it's not we did any of

that it's not anything special yeah and

this int is my lowest score and we

walked around with the sword - to see if

there's any no I I leave I leave a

gazelle outside oh no it's gonna happen

if every angle in here I get nervous

we specialize in information so

I'm certain that there is something that

we could learn that would benefit your

operation mm-hmm what is at the moment I

don't know I'd have to get out of this

the question is is it worthwhile for us

to get in contact with your people won't

let them know where you are

well we're looking even that there

doesn't seem to be any obvious way to

get you out of this little pickle I

think what we need are more do you does

your organization do you work with Jim

so Dragonborn I can it needs must mm-hmm

was routine more of them that's probably

what it would take to get rid of you

because the only ones that we're aware

of is 12 one who's probably not too

inclined to help us at this point

another one that we've never met before

someone killed her yeah the other one

that we don't we never met before but

have I think like an appointment with

like the not the editor-in-chief but the

print maker Dragonborn is part of the

Brooke for the broadsheets but then

other than that I don't know of any

other gemstone Dragonborn in capital

district who's walking around with my

cape

oh I think that's just a normal dragon

boy yes oh it wasn't a gemstone

dragonborn dragonborn in capital well I

mean it's possible that you know one of

the war breed could visit this place but

if you're a gemstone if you're a dragon

born in capital you're almost certainly

gemstone - oh really oh like oh I see

and there's me a favor

oh I don't know I don't know is there

like is there like a a neighborhood no

they don't there they're not an enclave

or anything like that but that's not the

onus airily the only way to get the

barrier open right yeah well I mean

we're gonna keep investigating here but

uh yeah liddie violent is trying to

figure out what she has that she could

that give you guys that would properly

incentivize you so she's racking her

brain biases do you know how to get

through that door with the gilded runes

yes well that's good enough for me I

don't know about you guys yeah pretty

 big in fact that's not a wish

no I know in fact I know and the black

iron pack does not interesting but

didn't they already say that one person

went through it it's still in there yeah

lady erosive are claimed that she chased

someone through that door and closed

behind yes they used to wish I see I'm

talking about opening the door mm-hmm

all right well I mean that would

certainly I think for that you know who

do we need to get in contact with it

bust you out of here you know as much as

I do I washed your I washed your you

know Celes friend concentrate and burn

some of her mental energy and she and

she puts her hand up on the wall where

in the hole was and she made the

difference uh and she looks at slings

crystal and she's like it just takes

power

I need more dragon yep all right well I

Modi's patron is a gemstone Dragonborn

Oh

dump some dragon what I mean we need OD

here for this yeah if anybody can see

into this area it gods can't but I bet

ballast on trips could or else and

tricks it just takes power so what I

maybe I don't think she wants to make a

charge yes to just like how would that

work what is Lady Rosa for do far as I

just concentrated touched it yeah gotta

get like five dragon when she was done

lady bullets he said she was out she was

she was spent yeah so basically like

you're going to use your entire sound

crystal or most of it I think to be able

to get to make an impact well we're

gonna have to get more char

yeah I mean I just yeah I do more

charges or we have to start repeating

some gemstones I'm going to come down

here and help us get her out yeah well

let's hope we don't use any more charges

today um did I did I miss hear something

she said like her her agents could get

her out of there

she thinks that eventually though

they'll find her yeah eventually they'll

find her hmm we can actually we could

speed that process up by getting in

touch with them right well he said she

seemed reticent to want to have her

agency come find her this way and quite

honestly we don't want more people

coming down here yeah that's true it is

just like more yeah yeah yeah what if I

made a simple transaction you're

mercenaries you accept coin how much for

your gemstone mmm perfectly aboveboard

transaction nope your money talks kind

of guy yeah I don't know another one of

those well but I mean this is also our

you know if we if we burn the crystal

and break this barrier

we're in do you have means to acquire

another one of these gemstones so cuz

well we'll worry about is this one

breaking but we need you know they're

very important to us have at least one

lady Valencia says it would take time

well items properly motivated anything's

possible and I'm highly motivated to get

out

[Laughter]

name your price completely typical

transaction kind I make every day one of

these have been mercenaries one gemstone

dragon thingy thing please

imagine someone hired you to recover

such a bauble how much would you charge

what do you want to do is there's many

more the money you you're you're

throwing away the chainsaw yeah you're

the chainsaw yeah but crystal pours on

the damage yeah he's gonna get you

better sward it's another gray steel

sword you give it up perhaps not money

perhaps there's something else you

desire and the lady villain she

literally says Matt would never say this

believable ng literally says perhaps

there's something else you desire women

power whatever it is that gift you're in

for solace to think about that well I'll

be here she goes and sits back down

against the wall

mmm while you're thinking make sure your

stone is fully charged

yeah all right

I mean which I mean we should make her

aware that that's gonna take like that's

a day or two yeah and we need to not use

even if we wanted to use I was started

yes yeah keep me though yeah SJ may says

the chainsaw was inside you all the time

yeah the chainsaw was really the friends

we made a llama yeah hey sorry guys but

the chainsaw requires the east yeah and

that gemstone gives us three of them

every attack somebody in chat edge Marty

mobile joke I was making with the maybe

the real chainsaw was a friend I said

that to me she said that she thinks this

time she may be a better one there's

bigger ones hey I mean if you guys are

willing to give up and give up the

damage in combat well fortunately we

have some time to think about it yeah

cuz we can't even do it now if you want

we did we need to charge the yeah yeah

she's already sat back down she alright

she assumes you folks gonna talk about

it and blah blah and I'll go ahead and

write angel a letter saying Groot more

job if you can get a even get a lead on

another crystal oh you're gonna do it

we're thinking about it my language if

you write a letter danger and you get a

letter back almost immediately

anyone who says boss oof Angela

that's a yikes for me dude

I sent them abacus just says what we had

to try he didn't say no he's just like

oh yeah those things aren't time it

doesn't anyway other other way show me

that one yep

interesting yeah we're not super

interested in fighting the old alright

go home again yet how do you know

there's no line gone there he's just

falling down that hole well we'll go

look later I'm having a peek in the room

yeah while you're gone judge went into

that room oh yeah okay see you guys

later

I think I took fly fly my house

you took fly no I was just kidding but I

could have yeah yeah she's the

spell-casting oh yeah she's like the

wizard exactly

I did take remove hearse but I guess if

you get cursed it was had to remain

cursed well if you want to teleport into

Phil's Gaiman how are you miss Kirsten

that one yes very much so

really yeah yes some worse than others

that's true yeah just a cherry he's

double curse Justin Shari found what

would appear to be the ancestral weapon

of his people and was like ah I found

his caliber and then comes running out

to like say there problems resolved I

found Excalibur and from our point of

view he's wielding like a carpenter's

hammer and we're like okay the next day

that's it work there's a like a just a

crappy little framing hammer on the

Shelf VIP room I just like took it it uh

[Laughter]

that's pretty cool actually I thought

I'd make I thought it would make sense

don't hear how even curse before I don't

know no this is one creature or object

is freed of all curses curse magic items

briga to mate with their owner I think I

got cursed yeah at one point really no

it was like something like here's a

blessing I think one of the one of the

undead things in the mausoleum put a

curse on me that was a f reduced

Oh like 20 years since I used to

pray it was like it was like I had to

her compass I had to roll a die to and

reduce that number from everything

oh that thing yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

right yeah the babadook mm-hmm Yaga I

really wish shut the pencil I

really wish it was here for the thing

yeah we got a whole thing

just lots of hugs that's all he's

watching right now watching is this a

bacon I need pencils lots of pencils

what is that Oh like a seal oh oh yeah

like uh like Indiana Jones taught in

Indiana Jones when he grabs them perhaps

the medallion sewn over their face melts

no that's when they opened that box I

don't know the Neo Jones I think I think

like Laurence literally only ever saw

that movie from first time oh wow I

don't think so because he's the one who

told me that I should watch it then he

gave me a DVD of it I was like what I do

with this yes when didn't he come out

was it like CD - yeah it was a same here

as seniors I met Ben 81

I've been anyone I remember sitting in

the theater yeah that was a

amazing when we seen it for the first

time a big-screen little bubble yeah

well that's one of those things has like

a trapdoor in it that goes down or

something well each one

teleports us to Jerry says 1981 so

several of the rooms that are that are

adjacent to this large room are empty

okay and they're just their doors there

are silver doors but they're just in

various states of standing over what's

the room look like sorry I think did I

miss it whenever you guys watch until we

know even it looks I mean it looks like

the rest of ring well it's got round

walls and a very very very slightly

curved floor and a very very slightly

curved convex ceiling there are carvings

on every surface largely worn away every

once in a while you can make out a

figure like a hieroglyphic figure but

mostly its erosion over over eons has

degraded everything in here and so each

each of these adjacent rooms is each one

blocked by a silver door well most of

them I would say one I would say cuz I

know one two three four five of the

seven rooms there are small rooms and

big rooms just have silver doors open

cracked up into one of them yeah I think

let me see this and I'll mark which ones

are which ones are standing so sorry

about that so this one's open standing

up standing open yeah so all the ones in

the middle to standing

and then this is call this a and B and

the mods are asking me to ensure this on

the Twitter can see Thanks so a and B

are the ones that are closed they're not

closed their complex standby complex

camera on Jana you scoop to you maybe

slight a little bit there you go yes

Jerry yeah there we go we are in this

one remember it

there is the room at the bottom has an

open silver door and it has its there's

a pile of gold that is sitting at the

bottom traps Jerry you're making so hot

yeah this Mike has been hot ball diamond

diamond Jerry turn your mic on and then

said nothing and lift a mic on now as

Microsoft alright so pile of gold at the

base of the door yeah like it's spilling

out of the door like that it was it was

a it there was gold in the runes on the

door and the gold melting you've seen

this before

okay correct and the door and the north

[Music]

yeah there's no door there there was

just a pile of jade mm-hm

well should be interesting

a destroyed J door and then for the

other rooms these are the ones that are

closed with basic silver doors they're

not closed oh they're a dark yeah

they're just they're just runic silver

doors open open just standing open open

and empty and empty well yeah no gold

that's fallen out of the door really old

so they took everything what someone did

Oh interesting

does it look like they've been recently

opened or well I don't know we have to

find out Sam my bad it's been so many

weeks since I got this the rooms were

kind of like the floor is kind of like

this and this unit is just kind of like

that like convex convex just very

slightly like bubbled out he's thrown

the walls there's like hieroglyphics and

stuff but that's your symbol ringing

that's just that's everything that's

yeah almost

with the exception of the god blind and

maybe it was one of those rooms that's

been true of all of them I ain't no

attention to the fact that I'm looking

at the purely purely for research

there's items in there right so a room

just open with a pile of Jade's well I

assume you can't like can we still see

in it we'll be able to take a look in it

after we fight a jade : hey that's my

line that's my line stay in your lane

[Laughter]

yeah

fold both open and both empty that's he

said he I think that's what he's for you

I mean they're all empty

okay but you guys are gonna be but

they're empty in different ways okay and

but something's gonna happen before you

guys really have a chance to investigate

them and I'm just trying to it's

somewhat complex and I gotta figure out

exactly what's more cheese you just

don't eat cheese with on the screen

let's just drop my mic yeah it is 1003

well we're we're not we're not we got we

haven't done any rolled a dice anything

what kind of deal is that well you can't

just play these guys just roleplay all

night and plot and scheme and send your

agents out to kidnap innocent bragging

rights

well yeah but that's why I'm here for to

make sure not work anyway I was 16

understood as I assume that's what we're

doing I'm sorry judge can I see your

character shape I just want to read how

one of your abilities works this one

sounds good

unless you want numbers popper can I see

Reggie well am I being confused or

hallucinating no I have a bandage on

that you are not being confused or

hallucinate I need you to roll a

20-sided die and tell me the result as a

1313 you have this Barrett

oh I see

[Music]

maybe uh huh you don't know huh I was

like well I mean copper have in common

and I was like I bet we both have like

super good detection of invisible hidden

or obscured creatures or specialized

copper hello you are you are okay so you

use a chain of Akron have entered this

quite large room

it's almost um if that gets actually a

little bit bigger by by about 10 feet in

radius from the iron golem room right so

once again everything you guys have

found so far has been circular and base

Metro and this is some sort of archive

or jail it's got a bunch of these

antechambers around the edge all the

doors are open some just appeared to be

kind of standing open unremarkable one

has is standing open and there's a now

cooled pile of molten gold at the end

the other one there's no door at all

just a bunch of jade crystals okay

sitting there and as you folks are

looking around copper attacks slim it's

not what sorry I had not considered that

what we draw on this sir I don't think

we need to draw it we'll just do theater

of the mind no you guys got presumably

there's no terrain in here you guys can

get I can we can keep track in our heads

of who's some 16 King has the sixteen

copper sorry sorry sorry see well copper

is actually copper oh you roll it what's

your decks mine five you have an

eighteen if

who blows right oh my god yeah that's

basically about in that slim 14 boots uh

11 well some of these are supposed to

have pictures on them and but some of

them are really well done and something

I kind of half-assed all the new

characters I'm sorry

boots 11 can I can I use my my

lieutenant ability not yet you can't

because you're about to be surprised

okay oh I can't judge 3 another one

charge is my favorite cuz it literally

cuz you're the ironstone yeah right so

you are in a constant state of readiness

you are as I do you would say always

maintaining and so you very calmly you

very calmly notice copper his eyes kind

of dilate and he looks around like this

he's like and they mouthed something

make an investigation you're like why

are you yawning right now seven you just

noticed copper kind of mouthed something

he says he says and then he shoots slim

all right yeah copper so Tom when I need

you to do is do everything normally

copper would do yeah if slim were the

enemy and a threat and trying to cut it

let's big cat do in this situation

you're a Burin charger be cat no not

nice copper so you have so I can't

obviously copper is not 100% aware

what's happening yeah but coppers

awareness is still in there

okay so you you are you're still copper

and you

know what copper can do and you know a

big cat can do and you can speak with

coppers voice it's just that there's

something else there's something else

happening that's that's compelling you

and it doesn't even occur to you to like

resist yes actually like okay oh this is

crazy

scared Oh interesting

okay okay okay yeah so yeah do

everything copper we do yeah 26 yes if

you rolled a one it has to be - yeah I

still get mister absolutely you're a

senior officer in good standing with a

train a macaron eight damage is are you

bigger than me yes he's definitely +7

I'm use my fury of the small eight plus

seven yeah

so sixteen okay like I might earnest so

far away all right

twenty-two yep or it's like twelve

damage huh this is cool anyway I think

the leg alright and what is a big cat

ooh

[Music]

yeah big house move up closer to slim

like slim yeah get him slim oh yeah big

cat seems confused but big cat does out

I told you she maybe was like hesitates

I told you to go actually yeah well you

ordered you order big cat yeah and big

cat moves to attack slim huh the big cat

doesn't again okay big cat what do you

yeah it would frustrate calm yeah yeah

there's something wrong but yeah but but

big cats not gonna tax them okay big

cats also a member of the changing

backgrounds ship its apologize for its

she's the actual lieutenant she

is that the end of your turn I'm done

then how many tasks is used to joy talks

awesome yeah they both hit yeah okay you

just make sure that he so slim for no

obvious reason copper has just attacked

you scared how this like so boots can't

use this looks happening it's a well I'm

sorry blue the only person who's not

surprised is judge and I believe

surprise means you can only take

reactions or some there's some

crazy limit and I'm gonna look it up

right now I'm trying to think of see if

I can get there faster than chat does

its race I think he's okay so he would

be surprised obviously is there a find

the Monster Manual definitely oh my god

I guess I'm what I'm wondering is would

there be any indication on Slim's part

that this is like if you're surprised

you can't move

you cannot take an action on your first

turn of combat and you cannot take a

reaction oh so I feel that in turn react

until that turn ends see they say

whenever I play it like this they're

like there's no such thing as a surprise

round in fifth edition' I'm like no but

there's the same thing as a surprise

which is you can't do anything a

member of a group can be surprised even

if that's the only differences I think

is that it's on an individual basis yeah

you can't move you can't take an action

and you can't take a reaction so that

turn it so what the hell can you do you

can look yeah I guess you can I don't

know you can what's done then yeah and

my lieutenant ability is you can't do

this yeah you can do stuff you can't be

surprised

so slave is surprised seems like is

going on yeah Wow whereas you're like so

you can take your turn normally are you

act I do yep because I want to read it

says that's a condition in fiction so

and then I go after so it's like one

full round it would make our Dean Street

yep and then I'll go again and then

everyone else so yeah slim spends his

turn going the is copper doing slim

make an inside check okay except when I

roll 3/8 don't you'll get to do that

again don't worry it's king and surprise

boots a surprise judge judges never

surprised by betrayal within the party

of course cooperate and move and talking

about it for him and lead them it's

finally a news channels my town why is

this dear chance while the iron stone is

active you just have this crazy like Zen

awareness where you're basically like

other people other people can be

surprised but you're kind of always in

this state of being of the act of any

moment

li 1218 Oh leech I don't lead to sleep

I watched is my River

I think it's classy of unagi yeah I'm

gonna cast umm dispel magic on copper

okay mark off the spell

just bill any multiple effect don't eat

your object in my DC is 16 yeah actually

how many's my bonus action to put a seal

on copper that way he'll have

disadvantage against saving from copper

oh my gosh yes has to die

yes it's round two if you want you can

do blue tell these your words has to die

but him

put it back here oh yeah there we go

slim swap cover and Josh slump complete

you can't use her mobility on copper

slim has some cigs it's something of a

double consciousness right now it's kind

of this thing

14 I think he's the Sun was in my eye

yeah okay hold on don't 414 uh yeah that

does Miss a Miss and I'm gonna use my

repost

my boss my reaction I spend one superior

already died and make a weed melee

weapon coppers are rich ladies unless

where is it I'm like eighty feet away

probably sorry short but he's not

standing next year yeah that's not he's

not gonna stand next year and shoot it

he's a ranger if we have to draw us out

we can but there was like no way the

copper is gonna stand five feet away for

you to show you over there yeah okay in

the back and so I didn't see him like

probably moving away from me

I mean copper it tends to be in the back

of the party he tends to bring up the

rear unless you yeah copy that

yeah what happens when you shoot it

somebody that explodes yeah

the fireball one that's trying to get

rid of all of our cool magic items -

yeah I know I know there's something

going on he's like he's like I'm

giving them too many and I don't I

definitely

you know I feel so you guys have magic

items I only just now thought of it the

fact that copper has these magic arrows

no you didn't you asked earlier about it

[Music]

no I trust you you trust me just a

straight-up fireball

what does the arrow say wait the fire

arrows are like the cool arrows that we

need to kill mortal no no not the right

arrow there's nothing to shoot at right

now you know he's gonna shoot one of his

special five arrows they got from some

apple fireball well you gotta roll hit

each creature I think isn't it perfect

Dex a micro 86 fire damage 86 to die

what no it's a deck save anybody slave

then you take half but if you hit slim

Oh after all view oh it's an arrow sorry

if you hit slim the Bible goes off

you're right I was thinking of deck

saves to see who's injured by the fire

if you miss it doesn't go okay yeah

telling little plunger at the end you

miss lamb has to die copper 18 copper

mm-hmm alright look I should've gotten

shit-faced everybody in the room

including copper bit gonna have to make

[Music]

the deck say thanks

yep yeah I got a 20-19 you made it fine

I'm sure judges fine leach 17 oh yeah

that's great I know yeah yeah this look

on your face like oh

that's wait I was excited to tell you

that I saved against it

leech leech of each well 12 is not

enough so go ahead and roll your

Stu's gonna get incinerated over again

it's just good it's I think it's 88 I

believe 86 is it a success is it yeah

yeah let me know if in 86 is higher 46

oh that's why I need ya oh my god so the

good news is because he hit there's no

chance that the arrow is expended it's

only if he misses it a special arrows he

ate have a chance of so you take 14

everybody except my bleach takes 14

damage leach takes 25 so does that

resistant is there a so yeah and then

your normal arrow debugging kill you

guys if you don't do something first

no damage no oh and a present is my

sword going off at all where's your

sword do it doesn't like demons no good

question 11 are you problem it slows bro

so now it's leeches turn now it's Lee

Chester okay leach how big is this room

it is as you see on the map sixty feet

or something okay mystical is in chat

here Oates what the I know you were

here Matt instead of wherever your house

fairy fire on

is there anything visible coppers lovely

green body and brilliant black top-hat

you notice that his blood pebble armor

glitters and the fairy fire lights

hitting it just yeah if only you were

here mounted risk so nothing nope

okay it's like possessed by a but yeah

yeah I'm gonna try to cats turn up dead

yeah that's doing it and then we talked

about I was gonna originally do hold

person but we can get the undead the

 off would do that

a matted risk last a question that I

don't doesn't really meaning I don't

know he means its cryptic anyway we're

trying to get it has an hour to come

play a wizard to replace you so well

members more about how this character

works it's really too bad he's not here

maybe a got on a plane the day

upstream if you maybe you should have

driven home it only takes two and half

hours instead of maybe play they didn't

take off maybe you should use his words

and text people on their phone

versus put it in only this is a most

obscure way to have an argument so

you're not going back only twenty years

I was fighting with my good friend via a

D&D livestream he was watching in the

Las Vegas Airport his phone wait he was

watching you played demeo's footy Todd's

phone its telephone Odie says the abuse

and then OD says you're the one

that's not here Matt who is the true

fighter

what is this newspaper telling us anyway

that was copper that's leech leech

casparo fire you recover that faerie

fire slim so I'm go ahead make another

in in such a slim is the only person who

has any chance of understanding what

this is okay if you will I need a pair

of scissors oh look at the right here

get him that's the nice thing about

having all this crap here is that it's

each of these abilities ooh that was

that was it was really good

now make a history check to see how much

of this you know history not

three three so yeah all you're doing is

it's the difference between knowing what

this is what you do and knowing what it

can do which you're sorry what's still

waiting on that text is talking to you

man mmm-hmm what is it that he just did

a bad thing on

he made his attention I made his inside

check which means he knows what this is

he failed his history check which means

it doesn't remember exactly what can do

but he knows where it is

well he I mean you don't know that he

knows what it is what is this limb okay

that's like I'm sorry now I feel

bad they're gonna say anything

well mm-hmm might give us a clue I'm

just trying to think if he's just like

 all right so as I attack what's

your I'm going so yeah you're gonna

close your distance yeah probably

I think it's rooms big enough for you to

actually like okay not like yeah it's

like 40 feet wide okay I think given how

big this room is and what was happening

it makes sense that you guys are spread

out yeah just to getting stuff copper

tends to stay in the back yeah but you

when you were when you were possessed or

whatever is happening

you weren't actively trying to i from

slap-ass got 30 feet should be enough

that's probably Emily I'm just gonna

call mine killer and and I won't do it I

will attack

yes how many boys do you have copper 47

no I lost 14 so whatever that was 1880

wasn't a 2000 are you are you prepared

nevermind

like you know how your works slim

you know how your works man

I'm sorry you could die in this common

is a 5% chance murder it up your hopper

by 19 hits hyper separated swinging he

has multiple attacks correct all right

so team downs the mine killer is not

undead so I'm going to use a menacing

attack to try and scare okay so that's

[Music]

20 damage and you have to make a saving

throw wisdom save me through 10 that

does not succeed so you are frightened

until the end of your next turn unless

these things are immune to that kind of

stuff I'm gonna find out miss it might

be is it frightening is a fright I'm

sorry is it fear being frightened yeah

yeah sorry okay well it's not it's not

undead well actually actually actually

yeah you're you make a good point that

the I'm using stat blocks for something

which is a proxy and I believe that this

yeah it works they were once they were

once corporeal inhabited the astral sea

[Music]

everyone's corporeal and now they're

they're like ethereal creatures yeah

slim has advantage from verifier old yet

another t20

are they Devils mmm still hits but but

another 20 yeah that's what I'm checking

to see do you chop off proper sense so

you notice you notice after you use iota

Singh attack you notice that his pupils

go back to normal no yeah and you

remember what you've done I don't

understand why you did it he still it's

very fire on him do we see anything like

fly out of his body

very fire does not illuminate invisible

creatures does it yes exactly

well you cast on copper right we its

lair area yeah it's anything can you see

how well let me look I prefer mmm-hmm

guys I don't feel so good hit me slam

it's a bit unorthodox and you see you're

like four arrows sticking out of my

give us all your weapons right now how's

this having fun

sit down sit on your hands no don't

worry fighting whatever it was it has

left him go to your room tackle against

her the affected creature okay each

object is outlined in blue green or

violet

any creature in the area when the spell

is cast is also outlined in light or

each object each object in each creature

is when it's saying if it fails a

dexterity saving through so just off the

ghost is a medium-sized the number that

I now have to look up the bonus to see

what what's your DC leach so yeah you

notice for a moment this gift looking

thing it looks sort of like slim but

it's different in one noticeable way

that it has

it looks very alien and it takes a

second to understand this outlined

figure you don't see any details you

just see its outline and it looks like

it has more elbows and knees than any

human or you've seen before well like

more arms or more like joints joints

arms well and then it exits the 20 foot

area is it floating is that like a

little ghost tale I can stir so that's

like Casper well what's guys would it do

that on it wouldn't it do that on its

turn this is it this is it being this is

what happens when it is compelled out

yeah well it does are things like some

Ghostbuster yeah yeah and it's not

undead it's just some kind of ethereal

so now it's main attack is the ability

to inhabit somebody else's mind

okay so that was leech it's slim it's

it's a parasite no no it was slim I

didn't get to do my second we don't see

where it went

it's in this room somewhere it's

probably in this room somewhere it's out

of me I swear Sloan don't don't I mean I

know it is I saw it I said I just

 scared out of you the power slim

compels you the power of slunk hmm now

that you've

like a chewed-up on my hip when you're

fine that's probably like nothing old

kiss and a youngest which direction did

it go it went toward the exit and are

any of us near the exit okay then I am

going to occupant to a fireball at the

exit okay real and see if I hit it I

guess I also like yeah I've managed on

perception on invisible things can I

roll and see if well cuz like I want to

see if I can see on my turn because I

want you have to make a procedure well

because I want to press you know what

the hell site does is it makes us so

that when you're looking for something

it's hard for the creatures using magic

to obscure their nature to hide from me

it doesn't give you a natural kind of

background awareness it's only when

you're looking around it's kind of like

looking for the predator right it's like

you're looking for yeah yeah cuz I think

I've to wait for my turn to do that

because I want to put I want to use my

connection to the seal on it whatever I

state it yeah I don't think it makes

sense for me to burn their little spell

at the darkness and is convinced that

the glow persists for the duration of

spell sure but this thing has moved

outside the area is it is it is it

anything that was affected by it now

automatically keeps the goal in it even

if it moves aren't the area maybe but

not for this thing that's convenient

it was inside copper when he cast the

spell mm-hm so King boots you're never

gonna do boots there's a really we can't

see this thing yeah shoot shoot the area

generally I can try and find it yeah I'm

in Josh I mean there's nothing for

there's nothing like at this point the

chain of Akron are like we can't

see it we don't know where I wanna try

and use my health site to look for it

yeah okay for my and I make a perception

uh-oh Cass I'll use my turn to castle

guidance on you

so you get it before that's a sixteen

plus two is eighteen eighteen to try and

find it now you can see okay so I'm

gonna go ahead and use my phone a

section to put a seal on it and then

after a seal on it I freaked out to the

others where it's at and then I'm going

to does Judge say anything when judge

identifies the creature those chose to

let the team know you can see after I

put the seal on I can see where it's a

point I point out to it as it's right

there I can see it um and then is it so

by the doorway yeah okay can you move

the fairy fire oh maybe I can say I want

to don't here it's kind of there is it

near where he says it is okay and I

cants I'm gonna try and use hold person

okay um it's gonna be a DC 16 person or

monster I asked you I asked if it was a

humanoid well it is humanoid in

appearance in the sense that it's got

two arms and two legs and a head and

bilateral symmetry with humans it's

wisdom save what this whole person say

does it say it only affects says yeah I

gotta look something up it says choose a

humanoid that you can see within range

to target must exceed on wisdom saving

through every paralyzed for the duration

and the end of each of its turns it can

turn it can make another safe by the way

it's gonna have a disadvantage on that

safe because it has one my seals on it

I'm afraid I might disappoint you

not great guys because when you asked if

it was new annoyed I meant I thought you

meant like does it look like a person no

not does it meet this Wow yeah no it is

technically not Oh

um I just saw something you'd like you

you like to post earlier oh okay there

was the cat all the cats are around the

bottom boxes yeah box tips the cat goes

like Joe's own so you can see it you

have a seal on it okay so I'm just gonna

magic missle it okay so that's a three

three guards go out for one day four

plus one four eight it's cool so so it's

gonna be a three plus the 2 is 5 5 plus

3 is 8 8 plus 3 is 11 there's gonna be

11 damage and then these guys should all

be able to see where the magic missiles

are huh Arkadiy never supports hitting

make out every time one of judges little

infernal photon torpedoes smashes into

this empty space you see part of the

mine killer is is outlined but then of

course it immediately goes I'm just

gonna continue to like are you done Josh

anything else I can do okie-doke without

telling anybody else make a Christmas

Eve and write your result down on these

cards make a Christmas a uh-huh

judge its torque it's only targeting one

of you but I don't want you to know

which one it's targeting so it's not

it's not it's not effective it's only

affecting one of you I know which one is

thank you

thank you God thank you all very much

this is like the changeling

 that I'll tell anybody else the

result read this don't tell you well

this is fantastic read this don't tell

anybody else the result read this don't

tell anybody else the result judge you

see the creature not try to escape but

it moves forward and it moves into the

center of the room and it's and suddenly

you're hell sight is unable to track it

and it disappears and you realize it's

gone into one of the members of the

chain of Akron but you don't know who I

will see you folks next week the my

killer will return this time next week

look for the campaign to I are gonna be

a lot of fun I think and new running the

game episode hopefully next week this is
