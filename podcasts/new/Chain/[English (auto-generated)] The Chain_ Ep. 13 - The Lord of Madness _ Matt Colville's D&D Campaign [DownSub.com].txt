show thank you for tuning in and

watching us play DDR my D&D game our D&D

game we don't have really any

announcements we don't have any sponsors

other than you folks watching us if

you're here as far as I'm concerned

you're supporting the content you if you

get a free twitch subscription every

month that you can give to whatever

streamer you want doesn't cost you

anything else doesn't cost you anything

more and we get a little bit of my iris

as I often do I reserve the right to end

the evening early if needs must because

I have broken my temporary crown and so

I'm sitting here and not a small amount

of pain but I'm taking a lot of drugs so

right now everything's great in a couple

hours

who knows so I don't think when last we

left our heroes done the chain of Akron

had made their way into there on the

it's this the Underdark job and they

have made their way to the it was at the

inverted towers I was there on the the

isle of madness in the Underdark and the

sunless sea where lives the lord of

madness who is an old one and they're

trying to recover the crown of house

Valletta which is down here for reasons

passing understanding and they bought a

bunch of Darrow who were we built a

temple to this old one and then they

jumped into a pool that led them into

the series of puzzles created by the

Lord of madness where he tries to drive

people mad with what he perceives a

unsolvable problems but the players

managed to knock him out relatively

quickly they they now they're exploring

house this weird ghostly ephemeral

slightly unreal ryeowon manor house and

they had a counter in here and then they

found the solarium which is connected to

the main manor house via that Dumbledore

a solarium is like a small green house

but instead of growing plants and it's

mostly just for show there's a natural

naturally occurring pool in here it's

like a it's like a baths where hot water

steam rises out from the pool the pool

is lit from below with this unearthly

blue light and it casts shadows

shimmering shadows on the wall that move

and twist as the water ripples and this

as you can see there's like plants and

stuff in here and there is a table at

which is sitting two figures one of whom

is dead and rotten and wearing a woman's

fancy dress and the other is an undead

gentleman wearing a crown that looks

suspiciously like the one you're

supposed to be here if you get it's good

there's only two figures a profit is not

know if that is not actually it's not

actually a monster to fight you can tell

us like the scooby-doo thing we can tell

what's right there you can tell there's

a three-dimensional object on the table

and where we was we got the outside you

guys are able to see all this through

the large glass wall this huge bay

window do we know if these things aren't

yeah there's that son oh those are large

full-length mirrors mirrors okay mirror

I don't even know her sorry reflections

I know

like yeah so before we've actually Oh

before we actually go in here should we

should we rest stats for him

oh I presume you already have those

written down somewhere yeah but I

thought I didn't know if they're on your

character sheet or if you had them

independently but I thought it might be

easy I have a separate page yeah might

be easier to just give you the monster

card for it

okay thank you do we write so long

the body if you can just like keep

remembering these pleasantries at me one

well I'm resting it's so nice it's

really healthy all right just wait we're

do my bedside manner does need some work

you're strangely is is just leach does

leach think is legion acknowledge that

that Slim is an officer when you call

them you call them sir yeah okay yeah I

didn't okay just curious nature dive

command presence what can I say I guess

yeah well you're in the group and you're

a higher level so you must be officer

yes

plus he can even connect to the he can

his about our his ship oh he's one of

the only people who can so leeches

impressed and a little M jealous yeah

distally yeah that's right he can talk

to the ship in your head all right so

you guys rest yes yes yeah no no you're

right yeah okay all right not me you

spend a short it's been an hour in the

manor house and nothing exciting happens

the passage of time is not easy to track

if indeed time is passing here and

whatever whatever realm you have found

yourselves

alright okay well let's uh let's peruse

this debacle I'm just gonna mosey in

here and see if this figure even notices

me make a make a perception check that's

a 19 plus two he's like you you an hour

ago you were looking through this window

and you saw him going through this

process of like pouring tea and offering

the woman's dead the corpse a cake and

drinking and it and when you walk in

he's like doing exactly the same things

in exactly the same order no variation

uh-huh okay yeah Lubin I think this

isn't I think this is just an illusion

whatever this is it's just imported the

same

I think this manor house is an illusion

I think the you know everything that

we've seen since we jumped into that

pool of water has been an illusion in

some shape or form and this is well

including the crown do you think is the

purple water yes I think is the purple

what yes

blues is it worth like sneaking up and

trying to snatches I mean I guess I

could say no day does the water oh yeah

the crown but there's mirrors in here so

I feel like this is another puzzle yeah

I uh I I would say if anything at the

crown here is a trap it's looked into

our memories and constructed these

facades from so it you know I kind of

want to look I want to go through the

mirrors and see if I can see them yeah

the mirrors and see it looks like see

his true self or something I don't know

empire huh all right so judges most huge

over here not in front of the mirror is

that any like wouldn't swing lunch or

the room we're outside again go before

he goes he grabs leash sorry okay yeah

you are still who are you people like a

cat doing it look into that still would

have been in eighteen mirror man I

forgot yeah yeah until you unfuck

yourself yes you are

your memory's foggy the farther back you

go the fewer things you remember and

that's including stuff like how do I use

the sort so stuff that you learned a

long time ago it's kind of gone it's

tough stuff like your short-term memory

is fine and who these people are is

actually if you uh if you don't want to

look directly into the mirror I guess I

could look through Rody's eyes and just

have him fly around and look in the

mirror don't just ask him I see I don't

mind looking through the mirrors I just

don't want to step in front of that

mirror they are they look like dressing

mirrors they look like ornate expensive

you know six feet tall with

finely-crafted gold or brass

pictures can I see ourselves in the

mirror which mirror you're gonna look at

that one it's too far away that's the

fog and death bod butts steam rising out

of the and they're slightly tilted just

a little bit because the idea is you're

standing for him and they reflect and so

at this stall it would reflect it's

probably the ceiling of this distance

mm-hmm even if you could see it which

you can't because it's too far away and

behind some steam okay the thing to do

I'm gonna say okay right yes what do you

see I see

very handsome me me what does what okay

go say Atlantic delusions yeah no

handsome they must be an illusion

yes never seen Conan the Destroyer I

played the lead in Conan the Destroyer

in my youth like I said oh I'm just

gonna get into look at all the mirrors

OD each mirror please are you going

because what do you see OD he doesn't

see himself can you describe it Andy he

sees he describes the the reflection of

the room and but there are things

missing from what he sees like he can't

see that if he flies over here he can't

see that tree it'll turn around look and

I look in the mirror and look over and

he has country and the table is there

but the dead lady isn't in the chair in

the in what he sees and the

the figure in the other chair is not

wearing those clothes but is wearing a

crap mmm and is desiccated and covered

in wrappings like holding is holding his

skin wrappings mummy hmm but that's what

he that's what he describes so there's a

there's a there's what appears to be a

real as far as the IMP can tell yeah

based on what the mirror is doing like

some of the stuff he can't see some he

can but that there is something there

but it's not that guy

right but the thing that is there is

wearing this crown okay Odie y'alls

Meera please do these these may look

like they're removable like you good to

me you can break up you could pick there

they'd be heavy but there are they're on

stands they're not built into the floor

but it would take probably two people to

lift him and carry him out

same thing same thing anything is that

second mirror okay so he can only see

himself the first minuto holy for

nothing else by himself in the first in

the first mirror oh yeah correct

I guess that's something yeah in the

first mirror he can't see the

reflections or the rest of this place he

only sees himself okay

so each one just shows something so

what's Oso what's behind him in the

first in the first mirror then just

darkness like it like it like a dark

room hmm

say we take that mirror I'll shift it to

try and point over to where this guy is

yeah yeah no I'm back to me quite this

idea this is a good idea

Thanks let's see this see this lord of

madness for who he really is

oh I mean it's like when you guys try to

take the candles out it's it's even

though it looks like it should move it's

it's reality the religion of its reality

don't allow it to move just got to be a

way of like reflecting like looking

let's see oh you think you're talking

out a puzzle okay yeah like if you were

to look here and it goes like reflect

reflect reflect you know something like

that man

can we you say though dressing mirrors

can we tilt them yeah okay yeah you can

told me yeah

just up and down correct give us you got

a how would you do that well I mean we

wouldn't need well I'm not look in the

mirror because I don't know if I

completely trust Kody's perception of

what it is I don't completely trust you

you said it was a handsome imp

handsome I'm wondering like if you look

in that mirror and try to find the

reflection of that mirror you know like

if yeah if you can get an angle no I

don't think I think you have to you need

in clear you'd like look at it from

there to over there but one doesn't show

any I'm just curious if you can see

anything different if you do that give a

guy you're trying to do mm-hmm I want to

straighten this mirror okay so I can see

I guess I don't have to straighten both

of them all right so I'm gonna

straighten these mirrors okay they're

vertical and I'm gonna look we're trying

to see this guy's reflection through two

mirrors through through this mirror by

itself and then try and like see through

try and see this mirror through this

mirror it's the same thing both ways so

it's it is as oh do you describe right

now is this does this figure appear to

be alive what do you mean in the

reflection is it is it like breathing is

it moving at all it's moving it's it's

it's doing the things if you look into

the mirror and then look at the at the

nicely dressed

undead Ryo and Noble it looks he's doing

the things it's the thing in the mirror

is doing the things that you see this

thing do I see okay um can I see the

other mirror in this mirror yeah okay um

can I uh want to take the hilt of my

sword and see if I can crack this mirror

wait wait so I want to look through this

mean he's dead now

I'm gonna try and look here because this

is the mirror that's different right so

I'm gonna try them through here to try

and do the reflection thing over this

way I don't know if the angles line up

correctly though for me to be able to

look into this mirror to see the

reflection from that one in that one of

this guy know what what does judge see

myself yeah it just looks like no you

did well I don't think so but you just

see you just see judge as though it were

really dark in this room so that you

can't make out anything behind you even

though it's not really dark in this room

yeah Symonds well actually in kampala

you're standing before mirror and you

see yourself and if you turn around you

see oh there's the blue light reflecting

off that stuff but in there there's no

blue light that was just this sir floor

is yeah this mirror tilts right yeah so

I told it down there's a floor that I'm

standing on no I tilt it up okay missing

anything above me nope you just appear

to be kind of wait do I do I look like

myself in this mirror uh you don't see

you in that mirror at all no I don't

know the only mirror you guys can see

yourselves in is that one over there

wonder if that one is like what's

actually happening that's why I was

thinking room standing there yeah and

this is all in the news right what if we

turn on a light or something over here

like with that he'll say is I have

advantage on perception check against to

notice disguised hidden or invisible

creatures I'm well beyond II I mean if

there was anything hidden in here or

invisible guys um well a disguise is

like well I mean it depends on whether

it was a magic disguise or not but

so as we are bound by his rules remember

this is the lord of madness lair

everything we see your memory will come

back and time he'll eat sir Oh join our

foursome to you join him sir I I could

send Odie to take a closer look guys

since this since this the crown is what

we're after right yeah I can't quite

seem to I mean I thought so but yes yeah

the crown appears in this beer and right

wait did we decided that this one is

like this she'll kill him for what it

actually is

it shows the dead guy as a mummy right

was he still moving in the mirror yeah

yes same exact thing he's like he's

drinking tea and passing cakes around

but the crown also still exists in the

in this reflection yeah yeah the crown

in this reflection still exists so if

the illusion of this room is false that

crown is actually there but that means

also there's a mummy guy there from the

mir the diamond am i able to get an

angle where i can see where the seat is

like if I scoot over like to here or

something I think he said the only thing

you can see in there is yourself right

so like it whenever it absolutely wants

to get a closer look at this this you

got in doo doo boots and I get the

hair-raising thing when we enter this

room I'm gonna dead being not from where

you are now you know we were standing

you don't get any sense of anything I

want to give this only give this this

chumpy a closer look see if there's

anything I noticed oh yeah when you walk

into the room when you approach the pool

yeah you start your hairstyle it starts

this down and you can pool bottom

I just said you walk into the room and

as you approach the pool you get the

hair standing on the back here on deck

did you goose bumps whenever we talked

with the day to give us this mission yep

what is that oh is that like a special

you've got and if it is I'd say a human

thing a human a lesser are you doing

slim you're approaching yeah I just

wanted to get a closer look at him okay

from he appears to be a finely dressed

Oreo a dead finely dressed REO and Noble

okay so not really anything of

significance that I could see closer no

not from well not from 10 feet away what

about him I go it mean he still looks

like a finely dressed REO and Noble he

pours himself some tea

and as he's going to drink it he says

tell me how is it outside in the city to

the guild still fight over money it

stinks but the caramel dip sausages are

quite good I believe they do fight over

money I've only been there a day yeah

really he can't eat drinks the tea puts

it down and offers the woman the corpse

some cakes but nothing happens

you gotta sighs huh I wonder if it asked

someone else a different question

whether it's just gonna be the same

questions no I'll ask him what he's

doing

what are you doing servant should not

speak thus to their master I am no

servant

I'm your better creature Oh slim who is

that guy he looks at you as always sees

you for the first time and he stands up

he says you work for the damnable guilds

[Music]

in0 70 scars I'll have you hung for your

insolence this work for no one hmm

what me me too

great given the wrong one to use the

gold one that's why I'm boots worship or

I forgot how to initiative I'm sure

there's a boot being here somewhere here

we go Oh actually you won't it my judge

which initiative I rolled the two so

it's four total so boots and George are

both for I'm gonna guess the boots as

Dex is higher than judges slim 21

Brigham leach uh leach got a five

od got 12 oh Christ yeah we don't have

one Peroni yet that's okay Mar has made

me whole bunch a little Jesus daily

bombers

12 okay okay

17 copper 11 well slim mmm-hmm this guys

is is threatening you you threatening me

how is he threatening me I mean he's

like what you just he just stood up and

accused you of being a guilt the guilt

member and said that he was gonna see

you hung for your insolence hanged he

wouldn't say okay but but I mean is he

like lunging for me it was not as action

yet okay you may have all initiative

sorry I'm assuming he's had to so I'm

then [ __ ] lay him out yeah first

attack grab the crown

yeah that's 25 is this a magical weapon

yes you hit okay all right

I'm gonna use one of my superior dice

[Music]

let's see here that 20 damage for the

first attack and he must where's that

come on baby

a trip attack makes saving throw

versus strength saving through has to be

15 strength save Earth is a 15 yes he

rolled a 15 he makes it okay all right

second attack he seems like he's a

natural leave rooted to the ground

hmm I know just really I'm just trying

to out that's a Miss let's see here

[Music]

dammit

alright I'm gonna just try and lay as

much [ __ ] hurt on this guy as I can

in this first term so I'm gonna use my

actions action surge and let's do some

more aking 14 hits

no no mrs. Sargent is a c-17 second

attack Wow for [ __ ] sake alrighty well

I'm done Phil go ahead and also my turn

no say it is coming

looks like Luke Maximo Duke Mexico

Mexican music Luke Dukes Mahato

I see is an imminent J I'm swirlies

night I'm done

at the the end of Slim's turn the the

figure appears to see those of you in

the room for the first time and says

damn you all guild agents will have to

make the same actually maybe no

Halloween

oh it's just a king and slim I have to

make a saving throw okay that's a it's a

concept

Oh 9/16 plus 2 so 18 slim you are

stunned until you have an extra okay may

be able to basically miss her next time

okay and then he goes and he will walk

up to slim this and press hunch l'm a

c-17 nope

well F Breen maybe he hit me but he

didn't hurt me

he hit like a child his eyes glow and

for a second you see the horrible

rotting village that is behind the

illusion and you have to make a thing a

thing yeah you have to make a wisdom

same thing for you are frightened oh

that's interesting

you will you got a for yeah oh you're

paralyzed crazy that's not good

yeah well if tongue does is is maximally

bad so anything else

on top of that doesn't really make a

yeah soon we can't flee right Frank well

no can I see stuff slugs I'm paralyzed

you're paralyzed correcto

get out there now yeah

did you and that's its UK all right so

I'm cast spirit weapon button and source

Reds ancestral weapon appears 1707 so

that's a hit thunder and then uh six

plus four so ten damage got it that's

force damage that matters I assume it's

counts as a magical weapon well are you

gonna do anything else on your turn I

know that is my action okay well while

you look at that up it is OD I believe

sorry yeah enough it can take you move

phone I first won a phone getting

towards Lodi will take us turnin if you

turns out that you have more actions you

can jump here forty feet even like or

forty feet oh you caught fly over this

if you really want yes let's have him

fly towards Ernie no I put him put him

so he's next one sodium so he's next to

slim slim slim why did this well against

no missus now so you can use your attack

to let him attack on as his reaction or

you know and its force to help well you

can if you do a tension spell you can

have it the touch that's what I was

thinking maybe that because he's in

trouble right was he paralyzed and not

though but all each knows is that slim

is like not frozen frozen yeah right so

I could see looks prone right look well

he's not a pro means on like I'm late I

know

oh yeah he's just like like stun it like

stun just good word for it even though

obviously leach doesn't think in D&D

terms but he looks like he's like right

that's pre unusual for slim given Slim's

Dubai that's what I think I'm looking at

him beating him

that's not right that's the guy that

does all the damage and I don't like him

like that so I'm wonder if I could send

Odie over there and Eastern that I would

have used my visit invisibility spell he

can use so he has invisibility so he can

go invisible right but if you want to

cast a spell through him I think it

happens on your turn on my turn okay he

needs to be vex it's a toy one so I need

to move him there and I'll turn to go

invisible as well

so is there an invisible and that would

be the end of his turn and then I'm just

gonna throw a guiding water Anam okay

seventeen plus seven so that's a hit

yeah sixteen radiant image and next

melee attack against him gets advantage

the next melee attack against and gets

advantage Jim Arkham or something so

[Music]

that was Odie and King it is now copper

in the EMSA shoot'em and hunter's mark

exstrophy 619 plus 11 a hit or fifteen

damage it's the first hit

magic magic weapon your bone bone bone

bone same thing 19 plus 11 14 damage you

shot him mm-hmm do you want to roll an

extra D 20 because you get advantage on

it or mailing it yeah oh yeah yeah it's

actually the next attack so go ahead and

roll it oh so that's my bed

in America well there was Ravana sure oh

we have a miss [ __ ] I love to write

well-read with sweets color so and then

I'll move up at the okay sorry PO

and then I'll tech at range is this big

yeah ten foot one oh all right I am real

I am done at the end of coppers turn

Duke Maximo dissolves into a pillar of

twisting sand and the sand blows across

the water and reforms that was the end

of copperhead because turned his leech

mmm well maybe I'll still stays a plan I

think I'm gonna turn you leave slim okay

and so if he does come back for you

which it seems he can just went out turn

right

so maybe maybe he thinks he's got you

there yeah I'm a bit yeah so I casting

paralyzed like yeah I'm Cathy

invisibility through OD on to swim some

disappear

hey that's cool just just leave my bait

lead the red base thing where'd it go Oh

I'm gonna stay Ryan are you done is it

oh yeah move yeah boots mr. fancy boots

hmm sorry just a moment sing him a song

well at least I got 20 damn sure circus

punk says he's slim visible best kinds

better than invisible he's I like it if

he does come back even one whenever you

all yeah like what well he's probably

gonna go after the big dammit you mean

got me now he's going for Ronnie but I

wanted a few things he can come I don't

know I mean I don't know if like am I

done for the battle or am I gonna get

the save again I'm going to dance my way

around in two right here and then he

makes a con save I stamped my boot at

him in this booming noise inmates

outward new concept you see 15 he got a

15 yeah well here's a very loud noise

and flamenco down

I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast a

hex on him tricks and so hex has no save

for you it's just a concentration spell

that never I hit you now I do wendy6

extra damage no chronic damage to you

and also I get to choose an ability when

I cast the spell the target has

disadvantage alone ability checks me

with the chosen ability ability checks

there no no what do you guys think would

be a good one for that with stuffers

back

let's do actually if anybody like

grapples amar something like that

looks like strength right yes they're

ducks and you have a strength thing

right what's the strength thing you try

to do not come I'll come down oh let's

say let's just say string why not this

is just ability chicks but that's gonna

be the end of my turn

well that was a bonus action right yeah

but the thing is like I can actually get

close enough to hit him you don't have

any ranged attacks

I think I'm had javelins but javelin at

him go I think that's gonna hit 21 yes

so I do is this a magic travel no okay

so I do want it probably one it won't

damage please let the hex oh right oh

yeah that chronic doesn't think I do a

six necrotic image on top of the to

physical damage does this seem like it's

impactful it so yeah you throw a javelin

Adam and the javelin goes right into his

where his heart would be but it just

slides out the other side and nothing

seems to happen

today's has to be other damage slightly

yeah are you like gasp or anything no it

doesn't even react well don't let me you

already have any extra fat you put a

judge you done yep we have a wand of

magic does your sword not you oh you

folks in this room all notice that it

starts to get darker in the dark

yeah the source of light in here is this

pool that's lit from below but did did

the cap work no no I tried there's this

large dark shape deep in the water that

is kind of slowly rising up yeah

and it's blocking out the light from

below yeah no flip he's done it mean

yeah can I not do it can I save against

that just it um it automatic level see

anybody's no there's nothing you can do

well how many rounds is that left

how would you know that maybe a lesser

DM but not me hmm can I think yeah

so could I say perhaps do like yeah you

can definitely think because you can

still speak but you can only speak

haltingly like you're struggling into

your words up I'm wondering if I could

use mage hands to do something yeah I'm

thinking trying to take it too far away

from that thirty feet it's my agent

isn't the crown you can't take actions

or reactions yeah okay

all right I'm stunned this dude the

undead

figure that purports to be do máximo

attacks oh yeah where's that [ __ ]

where's that witch horrible nasty powder

will I use magical weapons are your

swords not match no okay

yeah the adamantium sword it's not magic

yeah they do know I think it doesn't do

any plus it's yeah or something like

that use why would the guy gave us an

adamantium sword yeah nothing I think

that's what it was it's not a magic

sword it would be just a break

constructs stuff already you said I

thought he said then say a magical

weapon or like it does it does the

effects of magic weapon but doesn't have

the +1 bonus is it no whack of the next

time in see what happens

does everybody have a magic what yeah I

can almost me slow if he punches you to

four plus uh 29 so yeah you're you're

paralyzed you're frightened and

paralyzed it's like it's like those

screams it gets cut off okay yeah uh so

it is done slim you are no longer any of

those things

oh really you're no longer stunned

you're no longer paralyzed and you no

longer frightened I mean it

it's a king's action the Kings action

can you just reach out my memory what is

that mean team sword is it magical when

you use a wand does that store require

concentration wasn't Oh what do you mean

I mean castles mansion weapon is a

concentration I don't I of course I have

my Dungeon Master's guide here why

wouldn't you yeah of course

Matt not Matt my spell yeah

just tourists oh yeah he's going to look

up wands now they workers are one

there's one who wants magic but for real

aren't you doing who has hold of it oh

well I can drop it on the floor for you

looking indexes there's no I'm gonna

cast told the dead on the undead guy

which is the chronic damage we'll see if

it does anything make a whiz save

against a 15 he has to make a wisdom

save yeah is this a is this a spell

it's a contra so yeah I smell a magical

effect No

[Music]

and it's Wiz yeah he got a 16 okay damn

it it's only my spells and with a range

of touch yeah okay

what's this spell isn't magic item

magical weapon which is a concentration

school so yeah it says that spell the

user of the item which is a magic wand

who must concentrate if the spell

requires concentration many I know yes I

looked up once expecting it to tell me

about how the hunts worked and it just

says a magic wands about 15 inches long

also its range see that the walk all the

way over here tap it and then you walk

all the way back

hmm

hit that crown anything comes out of the

water like [ __ ] it's not he's got a

nexus where is the crown I thought it's

on the guy it's on his head I guess he

could go over and pinch the crown is

this water like the water that we use to

get into this area seems to be or that

thing roaming the water with us more

transfer back through oh that's right

wave oh but oh we all will end up right

in the lord of madness mouth yeah I'm

thinking we need to get this crown and

get the [ __ ] out before that thing

whatever that is customer stone time

we're happening right now

[Laughter]

that's the second dynamite

it is Audi's governent yeah I've lost

track it is yeah yes I missed

Kenny Kenny five it in and grab the

crown he's why is he fully or not come

get it

no well can't he just do two actions

he's invisible I guess he can't do he

can't fly over there and do it could you

could move and writing and that he could

what's the do you - which is a double

yeah right mmm bacon - yep - you can

taste removing equal to your speed yes

so you can move and then - oh then you

might better get within range but then

he's just gonna move and he well maybe I

can get in like sort of range so then

our next time you could yeah let's just

have him fly over the because I can't

get there I can't get close enough to

help like use that help action so

alright I think I'll just buy if if

whatever is named Duke maximum Maximo

decides maximum maximum Duke Max Jude

new David Bowie's a little known alter

ego this wrestling persona 104 pounds

maximum Juke

yeah let's try that let's just move

unless so old Max Juke stays beating up

boots so he'll be close to grab the

crown for next time OD but make sure

little at high road these homie too

close to that so you wanted to go 40 or

more now you fine it okay yeah he's fine

there okay stay there OD behave yourself

copper and big cap oh oh yeah yeah don't

even have to move

still got fires mark on them 17 plus 11

hits or 13 damage or tech 14 plus 11

that hits or 30 damage sue I don't want

to go over the water alright I'm done

it's believed I know my what's the range

of my agonizing pacify little wider

it's like other at least 60 feet 129

while with a range I think I'm gonna

give him a blast

see how he lets not move that what is it

+6

let's turn both aiming at him no no that

would be iodized he blasts little one

huh that's a seven and a 5 that's a 1 a

1 in 5 all over 2 shot one of them hits

beyond the end of the nose yeah and as I

do that I look back at the door that

right now and go anyway notice the bow

and now his leech gun that was leech

it's boots your

and I think this guy hits awfully hard

friend dude yeah yeah judge so leach is

pretty magical you go grab him just pick

him up and swing up and swing him that

much magic my [ __ ] sore use your

bonus time you said the one who said all

right Thank You c'n one well I'm gonna

Bernie minor so it's rose already

I literally already had like a [ __ ]

Constitution spell up so I have to break

that one to use this so I've got the

wand and it's supposed to cast at the

lowest level so how do I do this is it

take like action it has like a slack

shouldn't have to have to be tough to

cast a spell so I wait until next train

so magic weapon is a bonus action oh but

using a magic item well it doesn't

matter to an app so you use para action

de pasión oh it's not know what's is

interactive onus action no interact is

just something you can do as part of

your turn interact with an object but if

you're trying to cast a spell from the

wand I'm gonna assume that for now I'm

gonna assume it is the type of action

that the spell is rather than a function

of the wand but I can since I my action

let know you have your bonus action so

you can bonus action here can I go to

section the wand on to my adamantium

sword is magic weapon upon section yes

yes you got a magic sword all right so

that's plus one also

oh really to damage in hit no one

magical weapon becomes magical with a +1

bonus to attack and damage is that the

end of your turn

[Music]

the one monster slim all right so I'm

good to go now right

you can be out all right so let's see

here my everything to the wall the the

walls are all glass like a greenhouse

but outside all you see is this gray fog

mmm no light all the light is coming

from the pool but that light is slowly

going out as this figure rises from

below sorry I just need to check

something only cast this on one weapon

at a time it's concentration he told me

when we got the wand that it casts at

the base level of it which is two you

can stir the heart home I thought we

were gonna be like Casio to UM trying to

figure out like my psyonix when I use

them like if there if there when you can

sit up I mean are there spells right

technically yes so it probably says that

you can cast them at will which i think

means they don't run out mm-hmm but

they're still whatever actionless

pellets so when you look up the spell

it'll say I'm a bonus action I'm a

regular act so if it says you can do it

at will I believe it means it's like a

can trip you don't have it right all

right then just but it does it doesn't

mean it's like an instant it's not

instant it's still whatever action the

spells right okay I need to just check

what the jump spell is chat will correct

me if I'm wrong

yeah what are you it's like that okay

that's an LFO apke pooping classes what

Phil just swore on stream

cops [ __ ] far away jump I could but

then I'm used my action oh and I

wouldn't get and I'd just be like

walking over there be like wow yeah but

I'm not convinced that you can't see me

mm-hmm how far across is that pool and

you're on the red dot right yeah yeah

[Music]

okay thought yeah [ __ ] I never knew what

I don't know I think actually acting

removes your invisibility uh it depends

on with the action yeah there's an

attack I think it's at the I've it's an

attack that's been like a violent attack

being strike costing makes the creature

visible attacking stroking or casting

yes definite strikes been amazing so if

I cast my jump spell then I'll I'll be

seen seen again oh yeah yeah you just

take a leisurely stroll you swim awesome

I got plate mail armor I think your big

strapping your picks cheer digs gotcha

get a sink little bit of water never

heard anybody sink like a rock I think

there's some color correction happening

on the screen it's like you look you

like you look boring mhm

it's that's what it is it's the [ __ ]

it's trying to deal with the shirt

because you don't look you don't look

beet red in person right but on the

screen you look red cast I think it's

cause hey it's pretty right in real life

she's pretty move me

as far as you can I'm gonna use both

both at my action you know and I think

for movement so I got mmm you hear an

invisible gift go run around that was

slim it's now Duke Maximo and dear

maximum do punch out Duke Tyson are you

glass jaw or glass Joe yes that was his

name right glass Joe first guy that you

fought yep

does this one have charges yes I believe

it's there's no no's 8a charges picks

you up and thrown the water damn so have

you hope for you remember how to swim

yeah can you well I'm stunned so oh can

you elaborate on the effects of being

thrown into the water

well you're surrounded by water hey am i

skim I just sinking her yeah but stand

by how do we but the Lord of madness she

just fall onto his head as he's coming

yeah I can still round that's right you

still have water breathing oh yeah oh is

it actually like splash I mean water oh

that's that's what that's that's what

when you're and as your yeah so the good

news is at the end of Duke máximos turn

you are no longer frightened or stunted

or mineralised was not an ability check

that you two had to mean you know that

he could pick him up and throw him in

strength ability check

yeah well he's hexed right now okay did

he take disadvantage on that is a

disadvantage or is it - 24 disadvantage

you're maximally thrown

[Laughter]

power bombs me into the water maximum

Duke do me a favor make a wisdom safe

[Music]

Wow 19 okay plus 120 yeah do you feel as

you as you as you sink para paralyzed

stunned in the water as you sink this

pool the depth like you can't tell how

far down on the pool goes it's obviously

much deeper than 10 or 20 feet and

there's this light coming from below and

you see this this pale green slimy giant

figure rising up it's got like three

eyes and one of the and they're its eyes

are these long stripes they don't look

like any biological organism that you're

familiar with and it one of these eyes

looks at you and you feel this

overwhelming presence pressing down on

you like like suffocating your mind but

but you resisted and I have a question

am I am I so now you're in control

yourself and you're just in the water am

i sinking in this water like it's

actually water or is this like the first

pool we jumped into where it's just like

your same thing you do it like it's

actual water okay water its king

[Music]

turns out that [ __ ] whirlwind

sandstorm thing is the most effective

thing while there's a huge [ __ ] pool

water there so I guess the most

effective thing you did was have a

dungeon master that designed this giant

room so go ahead and make a would save

Durin's magic against is this helped me

on my 23 actually wasn't never mind your

concentration was broken yeah that's why

oh D oh D oh D oh D let's do it let's

have OD fast straight over maximum Jukes

head and pinch the crown okay job done

yeah he goes he just Oh tears

yeah you could put it on when he gets

it's probably too big it's like air goes

around him you can wear like a belt

yeah uh-huh

a table is something with your class for

big cat doesn't get initiative no that's

on my turn alright well go ahead and

make a acrobatics check Oh

rody oh well it's like I guess it can be

it's like it's gonna be a dex check if

you have acrobatics you can add your

acrobatics modifier otherwise it's gonna

be Dex it's gonna be dexterous I hate

Acrobat

I mean it's Australian no okay well it

was definitely a very slim chance for 16

16 mummies are strong but they're not

very dexterous even- dexterity um so

like if yeah okay yeah

Odie snatches the crown the the the Duke

sees the IMP coming and tries to pull

his enemies the OE can't see them he's

invisible

that's right he's invisible

so I guess like I would just given you

advantage but you ah so go ahead and

roll again doesn't matter you already it

yeah so he the the it's the mummy is

relatively sore the Creek Duke Maximo

nothing relatively slow moving or just

somebody like boots and so you're in is

able to kind of just go and the rest of

you see for a moment you see the crown

float off the Dukes head and then it

goes I think can I get him out there a

bit now as well because how far it has

done out for you used it was here so we

moved 5 10 and then yes yes fully so he

has a great laugh but yeah yeah

yeah yeah yeah I don't know let's get

out of the way for now

[Music]

well found play yeah that'd be a weekend

I'm just gonna keep shooting them I

guess started 19 plus 11 it's or 15

damage second cheese-rolling 18 plus 11

hits or well 17 damage is dead oh cool

what yep

maybe to crown the figure the arrows

slam into his body he grabs them and you

see the illusion start to dispel now you

all see this figure this undead not you

because correct those of you who aren't

in the water see him this figure appear

and it's wrapped in in like stained

linen keeping his skin together and his

guts his preserved guts again and then

the whole thing collapses and heap of

bones and rags on the ground

must've been I mean that's you it

something yeah leech

[Music]

I taught me let's get out of here

we got the crappy half the crown I mean

there's nothing gets to it'll hack in

here we got a giant over in the Tower of

madness so is that if that just goes

back into the but it's away from a good

place

oh right how do we get out you try going

that mirror for in the water

oh there you see our reflection yeah

oh yes that the real exit like try it

okay well fun now shall we yeah we

didn't touch it

30 probably yeah okay I'm gonna head on

that mirror through it leech disappears

[Music]

where he grows we're the crown you guys

can't see him he just hear this and then

you hear that even though he's invisible

you can't see him you hear the the the

distinct sound of an invisible M putting

on a crown and then cavorting in the air

[Laughter]

that was leeches boots I'm gonna swing

like I've never swing before doggy

paddle my way I'm gonna reach the water

[Laughter]

this guy's gone so uh how like how much

does it there's a a boots sink Oh only

like 10 P okay so um how does how does

like swimming work with regards to like

using up your your movement do you know

a fan

I don't but what I'm gonna rule is that

it's like difficult to write because you

don't have any kind of innate swim speed

like an aquatic creature would so

barring me just knowing off top my head

I'm gonna rule that it would take you 20

feet of movement to get out of it okay

I'll take 20 feet of movement and I will

pop up out of this pool have a look at

you guys we've got the safe yeah yeah

who's right yep ball climber throwing

huge photo move it cost one extra foot

cool nice all right I just said I'm

gonna guess it works like this we gotta

[ __ ] go

I have I have we need to leave we very

need to leave we assume it we most need

to leave means some you would have seen

me write you yeah

next you come back out here yeah yeah I

mean if you guys are I mean indicating

that this is the mirror that he went

through I'm gonna I'm gonna use my - you

just uh so that's 20 here sprig sat

drinking pina colada you're back at the

end it's judge yeah you see drenched of

boots emerge from pool say we really

gotta go yeah a whole bunch of [ __ ] was

happen all at once we just bleach is

gone yeah the thing is dissolved I said

yeah you also hear it invisible I'm

going yeah I go through the mirror and

for you do you do any fun yeah

[Music]

where's Lou he's invisible right thought

it a pull

alright so you can do your jump right

Rox frenzy Jersey art yeah

[Music]

make it don't you want to go through

this one so I think this this should

work okay I'm going to get use my action

and cast jump on myself okay so I think

that makes me invisible presumably

invisible visible yeah yeah yeah boy and

then I'm going to walk or run or

whatever move one two three four five I

think you can cut that corner mm-hmm

okay so one two three four five six

well now on on the last one I want to

jump right now and that will take me I'm

pretty sure always open to the it

triples my jump distance so I moved I

moved at least 10 feet and then as long

as I do that I can jump my my strength

and which is 1833 right is 16 20 25 30

35 40 45 50 55 will get you right to our

judges

oh right in front of CEO bf nerve 1-yard

oh yes so I hear ya I've just read judge

the now if you clear obviously running

toward the mirror but you sense behind

you the light from the pool is getting

dimmer and you begin to see this large

shadow being cast on the walls of the

manor house from whatever is in the pool

I need you to make a wisdom set fish

that's like this big except if my arms

were way bigger than this

[Music]

I know give me a second slim has

will become a featured player in my

puzzles and you see judge who is

standing in front of her like riposte

stops and turns to you and grab ya s has

a sword out and moves to like like at

some point in the near future judge is

gonna do something offensive toward you

what cannot be such your mom jokes come

from eggs we were talking before the

game that I found I didn't own I know

that Charles Stross famous UK science

fiction writer invented the gift because

he was a contributor to the fiend folio

the original fiend folio but what I did

not know is that he borrowed the name

from a george RR martin short story

soget Yankee comes from george RR martin

story yep pretty cool

[Music]

it's king george the seems as though

he's having second thoughts about going

to the mary he was barreling toward the

mirror at full speed but that was

stopped and has sort of looked at slim

as though maybe there's something wrong

ah isolated for the road judge in the

mirror I can't wait for the [ __ ]

campaign throw judges in the mirror I

was going to yeah oh right now I own the

commander alright so I'm just gonna

order I guess in this case fling yeah

okay well King is not resisting so it's

not unopposed Robin you can just do it

right place yeah yeah so that was who I

thought that was copper and they can

move it like leeches has already gone oh

yeah can I

do I have any sense of how far down in

this pool this we're like five or 10

feet being is okay at this point it's

about - it's about to emerge all right

it's crowning come on I'm gonna run to

the mirror and I'm gonna bust out my

fancy mandolin and start strumming a

tune the mandolin has special powers

yeah making make a whiz save with

disadvantage I can't even imagine all

right I touch the mirror disappears fool

judge is already on the other side it's

you sling you're the last person left so

you all bleach you find yourself and

when you hit when you touch the mirror

you find your it size you feel as though

somebody just dropped you from a great

height into a pool of water and SPO

orienting yourself and spluttering you

swim up and you climb out of the alter

the large bathtub shaped pool that was

in the temple of anti sanity and you see

the dead Derro in the room where you

left them and then one at a time coming

through the coming through the -

climbing out of the altar are the other

members of the chain of Akron George

seems particularly disoriented like a

big cat is this like thin little cat now

shake some water

so smart I dream I'd be still invisible

right so I call him over od come here

Levi's are give me the crown

give me the crown kitten Cody the crown

he gives me I take the crown and I hand

it to King the crown I believe sir you

guys are back in the temple van success

I think you need to get ready

proficient yeah you know I have to the

ship well let's not celebrate too early

I'm already out the door - like as soon

as I got out the pool I just continue

running you've been running this you

guys make your way across the island of

madness the Isle of madness and it's a

great running across I like madness -

yeah and you yeah it's still the city

hasn't changed your back in the your

back in the Underdark

when you look up you see these tiny

green pinpoints of light like green

stars

the city is illuminated with this faint

white glow coming from the walls of the

Dead ruins and you make it to the beach

and there's the somnium - nippers and

it's its tentacles are extended so that

you can run up them and you make it on

to the ship back - strangely enough this

is your home this is your home base slim

this is the ship you served on as a

slave for many years before rebellion

and the rest of you now have spent

several days on this ship and so it's it

compared to men feels normal here to the

temple of anti sanity this is normal all

right I'm gonna head for the hell yeah

you're able to make it to the to the

pilots quarters - Ellie right on the

crap make sure it's real like

better side over when he gave me the

crown does it feel magical no don't

ground just a crown right lets punch it

slim yeah you put yourself back into the

into the pilot's seat and you give the

using the map you give the coordinates

to capital to the navigator oh and it

sets the course you activate the ship

the under its own tentacle slash flipper

power it's able to pull itself away from

the Isle of madness sail out into the

sunless sea the perfectly solid black

water like glass there's no tides there

are no waves and then that experience of

the walls first the pink veins the

slightly glowing pink veins of the ship

begin to glow brighter and brighter

until the walls are glowing this

brilliant white light banishing all

shadow blinding you until you can

literally see nothing except whiteness

and then the light is extinguished and

you hear the call of gulls and the smell

of salt air and to Slim's nostrils they

seem permeated by microorganisms and

creatures that do not get out of the

ocean to go to the bathroom and you are

you are about an hour off the coast of

Kappa and you're able to presuming you

don't wanna do anything else so you're

able to go redock you guys have your

papers so you're able to get back

through customs your squid ship is now

once again birthed

at the docks customs getting through

customs is no problem you're able to

show your papers you have the crown of

house Valletta with you do I have papers

yeah you've been through customs I have

seemed everyone that way through yeah

let everybody everybody all the members

of the chain of innesford okay just some

of them went back to the ship when they

were done all right I want to have the

the Navigator take the ship out so that

it can

okay eat well there's a crew on the ship

so they'll stay with they'll stay on the

ship won't be unmanned sweet but yeah

the navigator can kind of drive it

around actually what's-his-name can

pilot toad can pilot yes yep he's from X

although I don't know that he knows I

don't know he knows I think I think I

think maybe well probably judge anybody

that was there during the nails thing so

copper but not leach not boots

anybody who's there when you guys were

figuring out how does this ship work it

probably knows that if you are if you

have thought behaviorist ionic right

then you can you can do the piloting but

probably toad doesn't know he can do man

cause he's a job as a navigator so yeah

the Navigator already sails my ship well

unless they've sworn fealty to me well

boat the ship around I will I will I

will assume that you guys are gonna go

back to the Pharaoh's dream since that's

currently your and it's 8:31 to take a

ten minute break and when we come back

we'll see what happens next the heroes

have theirs heroes have ventured they've

they've finished the Underdark job

they've ventured into the world below

they have found the Isle of madness and

then the temple of anti sanity and they

did battle with the traps and puzzles of

the Lord of madness and then his

simulacrum of Duke Maximo Valletta and

recovered the crown and every time yeah

anyway we're back where where were we

well unless we left our heroes so I

think lore there is this is typically

the time where those of you who have

stuck with all of this nonsense that

we're doing and are still around we like

to hang out with you for a little while

and show off some of the neat stuff

people have sent us and if we have

anything important we need to talk about

this is a good time to do it do we want

to look at the fan art or do we have

announcements so people will send us

amazing amazing stuff that is

genuinely humbling and mind-blowing that

that the nonsense that we come up with

inspires people to create that's um it's

a really rewarding element of doing this

anything we do that makes other people

want to make stuff is pretty dope so

let's take a look at this we have such

an awesome piece of art because it

really does have leeches at Jude he sort

of looks like a kind of upper-class this

really like that is a great looks like

the mini that is a great God has such a

dope ass he nailed it and I love it they

were like the little loop D's on the

sword hills yes yes that look that

reminds me of lock and key the author

like that definitely has a very similar

or like facial expressions paint the

chain playing D&D at the table okay push

yeah this is awesome Matt Katie yeah

this is great yeah this is this is doing

this like a master base

[Laughter]

and I think I shouldn't admit this is a

map some guys been making of capital and

as far as I'm concerned that's capital

yeah and you have to be able to zoom in

because there's crazy crazy detail down

to like the street in the building of

capital I've offered to buy it from the

dude who's making it we're probably if

that happens then we're probably gonna

take it and probably have a cartographer

actually go through and kind of some of

the detail is I would want to exhibit

some authorship over it and be like well

there should be when these things

there'd be one of those things there so

though maybe another revision but the

guy said you know let me let me finish

it first and then we'll talk again so

yeah it's pretty dope dude was there

something else we want to talk about yes

we have a new round of pitch mods and

soo I want to give him a shout out

because they're doing amazing work so

from before we have learned Lord de Rock

still he's our leader now I mean he's

the king of the mods king of the mods I

mean a total fill and has two

enthusiasts who you all probably

recognized from before and then we have

new mods who are carry pee ice pour

reagan earl Ozai 75 Helios Storm Phoenix

in Kosrae these are people are any new

mods yeah I think what's the rate

because it was the plan was every X

amount of time it's not three months

about every three months we want to

rotate mods out because it can be it can

be a psychologically taxing job and we

don't people to get burned out it turns

out that a lot of times when you're like

watching this stream so much you're

watching chat yeah so it gives them a

break to actually jump back in and tune

into like what's happening on stream and

kind of just be there as a good force

instead I think one of the most positive

things to come out of this entire

YouTube twitch streaming game streaming

D&D thing is the community that we

and the reason you can go to our YouTube

channel and read the comments and it's

not incredibly toxic and the reason you

can hang out and chat and everybody's

super cool is because of we believe in

heavy moderation that's a lot of work so

thank you very much for the months that

selflessly work to try to keep the place

cool and fun and yeah yes and then also

we've got something that's right this is

the worst thing I've received from

someone this well this was actually

addressed to it's not Thomas it's no two

copper of the chain of astronaut acted

up they asked me if I wanted to add our

new business to the mailbox so can we

see can we see the people so this is a

from Eric H it's a big put on the little

big cat what's the dragon from like

toothless oh that sure makes no excuse

me no dangle this is the most peaceful

cloud does not allow you to not play

other people's music it has a setting in

the app to is turn off autoplay and all

it does is let you feel like you did

something and this is apparently no I

looked it up as a notorious problem with

SoundCloud the people who run SoundCloud

are like we don't want you to be able to

we want you to have to listen to the

people's music it's how we make money so

let's see if I can start this that's

crazy that we played that hole because

some of these are like an hour long I

can't possibly have play the entire

thing so are we back to the Pharaohs

let's see hang on you want a report from

the junior off this works I notice near

I was skulking around anywhere good no I

don't forgotten so how long have you

guys been gone by the way you guys did

you guys take a long rest while you were

long basically been I think since you

left only a days bath so this is the

next day I assume you guys are gonna

spend the night you're gonna rest and

recuperate all your [ __ ] we can we like

send for this Orfeo attorney like just

to like meet us in the morning yeah

absolutely every you guys all have your

your body servants is what they're

called yeah anytime you want to you can

just say to them hey can you go have the

concierge inform our colors yeah that

we did that yeah I know me

the-the-the-the there are three

restaurants in the pros dream the one

that you guys tend to use is called the

hanging garden he'll meet you in the

hanging garden tomorrow morning for

breakfast sounds lovely

well I have a room in leech has a room

you can get one yeah you don't you don't

have but you can't get one okay

I would like okay so I don't know if you

were here or if you watched the whole

process but these are sweets these are

expensive rooms on the fifth floor of

this hotel the hotel is designed to look

like an ancient Egyptian aramid right

but like a high fantasy version of an

ancient Egyptian pyramid it's very

opulent there's a lot it's all sandstone

but then inside everything's gold

fixtures and a lot of plants everywhere

inside a lot of holes and the ceilings

to allow light and so skylights all over

the place and sorry yes you can really

recommend think of the word for Scarlets

[Laughter]

no big long rest because your son you

can also you can also cast restoration I

don't know if you guys have restoration

so and your so you have a multi room you

know this is kind of like how the

favored of the matriarch would expect to

live in your and your drow clan right so

there are several rooms and they're very

finely decorated there's stud those

rooms you but you not even sure what the

use of is other than just to hang out

and be seen in there's an opulent

bedroom there are several different

washing rooms and you have up servant

you have a young boy who will basically

stand by the door he stands by the door

any waits to be told what to do

and and so anytime you need something

he'll just go get it she's paying for

this room okay it's coming out of your

pay I like I think it I think it's just

the treasure you uh I'm not sure if you

guys actually paid cash you might have

you might now we did we pay for the

clothing but I think that staying here

is just you you can afford it because

the track what's the trip who's keeping

the Treasury and what is the Treasury

that's about to come up I think if they

Scott it around not sex it's nice for

three

it was either four three one eight

twenty thousand for the crown yeah yeah

yeah which is like you guys the why

should say the fact that the Treasury is

at three I should make a list I

apologize I should make a list of all

the stuff you can do with the Treasury

because you're about to be able to buy a

lot of stuff depending on what you want

hey Lars what was that stone cold sonic

crystal cue of a medium so it's a medium

silent Crescent oh my yeah you don't

have it yet oh yeah okay sweater field

he's reading it well is that what you

muttered something you might have

something there Lars I was like I said

he's gonna yeah so capital the stays you

guys have just been to another world and

fought a whole bunch of crazy stuff but

now you're back in capital and things

that people are acting like everything's

normal because to them it is they have

no idea what you guys we're doing but

the city still bustles and moves and the

Piazza the plaza that stretches along

the length of the stays is still a riot

of different characters from all over

orden the Pharaohs dream is still

populated by incredibly rich foreigners

mostly and visiting dignitaries and some

military officers you spend the night oh

yeah

that night can we can we rent out the

bar of the footstool can you rent out

the bar of the footstool for the chain

yeah yes

wait why because we just a party boys

sure

yeah angels not there keep the ranks up

but everybody else why is angel nothing

I wish you know that angels yeah so

you're able to go to the to the stool

the footstool and what this is

interesting

yeah yeah you throw a party yeah hundred

percent yeah the owner of the footstool

is a stone giant yeah tight yeah

Hiram and he's got a wharf kind of

what's why I'm looking for a headwaiter

like the guy who cleans up of the place

and between the two of them there are

more than willing to take your money and

this is where all the other soldiers the

rank-and-file members of the chaîne hang

out and they've kind of taken the place

over there are other people that stay

looks like there's about a dozen other

people in the common room but apart from

that it's all chain books cool managed

to recruit anybody where were gone that

was a scallop two-shoes will tell you

that like angels is out there right now

just trying to figure out what the lay

of the land it's okay like he seems

incredibly busy it's only been a day

well I think it's been two days since

you told angel to go do something

because you guys you guys took the job I

think you were like rested that night

then the next day you set out then you

rest it in the Underdark interpret oh

yeah I forgot

someone's last time that tissue saw

angel two days ago we should probably

make it a thing to check in once every

day I told him I told him that sir you

did home yes yeah so that I said that

all junior officers should report back

here at least once a day and as long as

they talked to me or bucks but then they

could go and do what they needed to do

after that

okay so you haven't seen angel has but

seen angel buts and that's a sign sir

and tissue this is like what was the

last time you saw angel what's like oh I

I don't know a couple days ago but but

he may have been here yesterday maybe us

on hmm

angel give you any guff about it I'm not

checking in once a day I keep load on or

well I mean he usually blows off what I

tell him to do sir I didn't think

anything of it sir he seemed intent on

on exploring the city do you know the

last place he mentioned that he was

gonna look he didn't he didn't he didn't

think to tell music he didn't seem to

think that it was worth my knowing of

course I think he should have told me I

think you should tell me everything he's

doing I don't trust him well that was

his task so I got a little little too

power hungry I think he's gonna get his

control yeah you're probably right

yeah yes probably true yeah we just got

into some trouble and it netted us

$20,000 so adventure Cheers there's not

any kind of really super knock you out

alcohol at this place you can you can

get you know you could have a good time

but there's nothing in here that's like

super expensive gonna gonna cause you to

literally pass out it's not that kind of

it's not that kind of in you guys were

able to have yeah and they want to see

they want to see the crown like like

tell us about the job like boots it's on

boots we got it yeah kick the other guys

out of here first

we said we'd be discreet well yeah I'm

just gonna strum a the other the the

dwarf that runs the it kind of runs the

common room is like while they're paying

customers I thought you rented out the

place I mean there are people already

staying here like you can count party

here this isn't this is a cow you can't

like hotel yeah but-- tomatoes don't

talk about the crab special especially

you event room up sales you could do

that at the Pharaoh's dream a Pharaoh's

dream has like ballrooms and stuff like

that that you can rent out but this is

just a hammer it's a nice it's a nice

kind of middle-class tavern I'm gonna

I'm gonna play a song about a little

ballad about how I charmed an Abba with

and had it like leaning at the edge of

its pool it's on the cheek and then

gonna sing about make a performance

check yeah absolutely it's a 23 Wow yeah

no yeah they're everybody's everybody's

amazed it's like my stereo let me know

we don't to do right now and take your

time but I want to know like what the

name of that ballad is okay like what

his name of the Ballad of the chain

going off on that adventure on imaginary

deeds like kind of scream a little bit I

got the crown I'm kind of but I mean

Odie is the leech leech has been a

member of the chain the entire time so

all the officers all the and all the

rank-and-file members of the chain all

are all familiar booty and that he is

kind of this you know this gadfly it's

commenting on stuff they don't take him

seriously anybody else in the inner in

the bar whatever seemed to be paid any

attention to kind of what's being said

that's not part of our group make a

inside check not inside investigation

it's a party investigation party judge

yeah what's that dried meat yes we were

not driving it and I'm no you you you

guys have let's see you guys have

cleared out the common room like once

like the dwarf is like I can't always

people to leave they but once boots

starts singing and everyone starts

joining in and they get to know the

chorus and so they starts to sing along

with the chorus and everything people

start they I don't leave or they go up

to their rooms until eventually there's

only members of the chaîne down and the

stone giant that behind the bar and the

door of running around like this is a

song have a verse about slim oh yeah

totally yeah yeah put a line in there

about how you like sliced in news and a

half nice right 75 damage one round yeah

the completely bog-standard character by

the way he's just playing a [ __ ]

battle master the only guys like a sword

that is magic but not plus one and he

just goes blah and did 75 points of

damage in one round are you not grateful

that Slim has joined your company the

the rank and file are like yeah they

love any opportunity to kind of get

drunk and row end yeah

plus this is like the first real I think

celebration you guys have had since

black bottom Yeah right so I'm gonna

give Cody you can accept my shoulders

give a little bit beer okay eat either

now say you like that and I want another

incident what do you like to what do you

like to drink

back up back where do you come from ah

[ __ ] I don't know a lot of license he's

my prestidigitation that make the blood

of our enemies yeah I make Slim's beer

tastes like it lifted look like it

lifted blood very good when we think the

part from that day of the evening passes

uneventful II you know around sometime

after there's no clock in here sometime

after midnight

people start passing out people have to

be taken up to their rooms

some people's since there's no one else

here now except members of the chaîne

some people are just happy to be passed

out in the common room there's a fire in

the fireplace and there's a couple of

guys in the chain just kind of like

snoring in front of it I would say kind

of discreetly to the commander that I

would bow her slim to be promoted to an

officer all right

following the events of two-shoe says

you can't promote him he's not a member

of the chain well you'd be quiet'

decided above I thought the whole thing

in the present do you want to join a

Janet scene oh did he I thought you

ready Joe I mean did you take the oath

no no well he doesn't know one he

doesn't know anything about the correct

- he just was like hey I'll join you

yeah yeah but

yeah I'll go with you for as far as he

knows that's just like it has happened

yeah yeah I'm here with you yes right

yeah I I think I mean he chopped three

Darrow and half and a single moved so I

think we should try and I think we

should make him our God a crown of

jagged iron appears as a trail is a very

drunk remember the change are you ready

to take both what is this both now

you're gonna be a part of the chain that

you're gonna follow those the tenants in

The Chronicle what are these tenants

there's a lot of them like TLDR you

complete the job yep in mmm there's a

chain of command right it's Chronicle I

mean it's not unusual for write the

commander or the chronicler to give the

Chronicle to a new recruit especially

somebody that's gonna be made an officer

just so they can [ __ ] read the thing

but there is there's it's kind of like

if you're a member of a fraternity

there's the book that they keep that's

like okay so so it turns out that you're

your chief surgeon is a spy for the drow

okay here's what to do this happened

once a long time ago it's all these

perceptions so they're not really rules

per se they're just this is how we've

always done things so I think slim would

ask questions to make sure he wasn't

getting himself into a situation where

he felt like he was a slave again right

huh you can always leave the Train right

yeah there's there's there's no you're

you're free you're you can leave anytime

although in fact um this hasn't happened

since we started this campaign but it's

not unusual after a job there was always

some I should say not a job after a

battle right after the whole chain

participates in some kind of war there's

always some percentage of rank-and-file

folks were like I'm out I'm done I've

done my time I did my thing cash me out

and one of the things the Chronicle does

is it's also a ledger it's like okay

this person joined on this day and then

every battle they write down who fought

in those battles and you get paid based

on how long

you've been in the chain and you get

some percentage of well we made this

much money fighting for this guy right

and so kind of the dream is that you're

gonna retire and be rich and go live on

a farm somewhere or whatever but what

the what the people of chain will tell

you is that typically what happens is

you cash out and you go and you spend it

all on Halen [ __ ] and you end up

joining but you end up joining the chain

there are like old timers will tell you

that like once you've been in the chain

for a while you kind of can't live what

you been a mercenary for a while I kind

of can't go back to regular life but

people dream they think they can and

some do some do well well some cash out

and we never see them again right does

that mean we don't know right but a lot

of a lot of guys come back right Slim's

familiar with military structuring he

wasn't always a slave so I think he

would be okay with that and I think

after that adventure he's like that was

pretty impressive

perhaps greatness will flow through this

channel oh well you know we'll take your

oath well you know what the job we're

gonna be doing is to and obviously

that's gonna be oh the gallery yeah yeah

cuz you actually hook for a job you have

seen at least a hologram of the person

that they are on the hook to find and

work like it was mortem that showed up

on the bridge of the somnium to neveress

I would kill that person I would kill

that creature

the only other official part of the oath

is that you leave your pass bar is that

whoever you were you're not that person

anymore I mean he kind of already did

that obviously no that's the only other

part of the oath is yeah I agree to

leave that part of my life behind

all right longer gellick the umpires you

know what's I'm no longer gellick being

pious oh right right no just doesn't yep

yeah it's an adequate name I'll take

your oath

you need my ship welcome aboard and you

need my sword I throw an apple to you

but it's not an apple it's a sonic

crystal is that about how big they're

know I think apples or coin is the

smallest one oh it's really okay

I think it's have been a while since I

looked at it so this is um you can find

it in strongholds and followers it's a

magic item that is H it's literally a

chunk of a crystal dragon and depending

on if the trunk is you get different

mental abilities it grants the owner

psionics I'm already has psionics I

don't need to say the card or it C I'll

get your card okay

but it grants you access to depending on

how large the crystal is you have access

to different psionic manifestations

which are like spells um sighs how do we

how do we tune with our magic you just

hang out with it and use it for a while

okay it's a it's a it just it's like

attunement is basically learning how to

use becoming familiar with and bonding

with it's not it's like a switch you

flip or a condition is just okay I've

used this thing for a while I haven't

tuned to it right I think there's a I

think it's like one day or something

like that is the minimum amount of time

it's actually pretty straightforward

this die remember how the tuning worked

in forth all right I assume it works the

same way good position cool but it's

basically a game balance mechanic to

make it so you can end up with a whole

bucket full of artifacts and I'm getting

benefit of them all right it can only be

attuned to two things they required tune

I think all right so slim will stand up

she draw his sword and with much some of

the drunk combo no circumstance and

arrogance say the oath whatever they

with is the awake the may the remaining

awake members of the chaîne all salute

slim some from their recumbent three

things Lord Rock says you can you can be

attune to three things you can beYOU

tuned to only some number of things

oh right yeah it's free ibly yeah so are

you

are those the many of the members of the

chain especially the rank-and-file and

some of the junior officers they stay

here are you guys gonna spend the night

here or you guys going back to the fros

dream yeah we should go back correct the

fancy [ __ ] names tomorrow morning I

want to sell the trash loot items we

have as well okay with some blue Jasper

black Jasper no gemstones oh yeah the

history of agar Nobles book fairy tale

book like stuff that you just listed

from last adventure that we hadn't sold

yet okay well they're definitely tons of

like the Capitol equivalent of pawn

shops and stuff like that you can take

things too especially in the states

where people from all over the world

come and buy and sell things there are

you know all along the piazza there are

storefronts where you can buy and sell

stuff and and barter things because some

people show up and they want to sell

something or buy something and leave and

they don't take the time to get their

currency exchanged or anything and so

they can they can accommodate you no

problem I'm gonna stay at the foot stool

die okay I want to there's a very cool

yeah a book of fairytales it's a book of

it's a book about humans written from

the point of view of the author who is a

very very stale hmm

I keep that you can go buy it back he

said he wants to go do it well I mean

yeah it's it's working out of your car

next morning so that is something you

were intending to do tomorrow yeah I

not yet advance the clock to tomorrow

everybody gets 80 for gold except judge

he gets 84 minus 25 if that book you go

[Music]

how could somebody erase do we have a

thing cuz I'm a racist so boots you're

spending the night here Oh buddy let's

go back to yeah I guess that was all

that was old money maybe we shouldn't

give it was I've had some wine feeling

nice and sleepy and this feels like more

of a kind of a you know more like what

I'm used to Pharaoh's dream is very it's

like it's like fun but it's it's a

put-on

right absolutely because you want people

to see you staying there yeah like even

even even rich people generally won't

stay there because all tables are this

is my office all tables are - rich

people don't stay at the Pharaoh's dream

only rich people who want to make sure

other people know that they're rich

people Statesboro street Oh like there

are there are but there are nicer places

no there's no nice well there are much

there are equally expensive places that

are way more discreet the Pharaohs dream

is kind of it's it's a it's a place like

there's my visiting dignitary stay there

because they want people to see you know

the people I the people I represent -

rich we can afford to stay here people

will get out of their coach and they

will stand there to be seen right there

are often reporters not Nero but they're

often reporters for the broadsheets

standing in front of the place it's very

it's a very loud kind of ostentatious

Manero in0 that's that guy that's gonna

tell the story of my looks our greatness

my we have a chronicle now and that's

where your story will live not in some 2

pence newspaper

hey if you keep chopping the more places

your story is told the better and may I

congratulate you on your promotions

Thank You leach how is the ship sir this

guy comes to me in my nightmares ship as

well she doesn't you caring for right

Boots's room that he just drew and the

rest of us are gonna get kicked out of

some pretzel nuggets

it's whatever it's actually higher than

well you don't have the crowds I'm so

dexterous no I are you wearing it King

said don't explicitly would be discreet

about the crown right yes I should just

run around naked well you're better off

I think so oh wait no it's 10 10 what

like without proficiency right it's just

you are asleep in a room that you they

provide for you

mm-hmm and it's it's you know coming on

early morning but still dark outside and

you are awoken from your slumber it's

initiative your weapons are nearby all

right but it's it's gonna take probably

I think like a minute to dawn your armor

if you want off okay standby so you're

completely in the stalkers right yeah

completely nude let's all take a moment

to imagine Tom Schmucks character

completely what played out is elese

wearing the boots no easy bonus but just

style yeah I get all points right what's

your district it is knowing a splinters

what did you tell Wow

so yeah you are you are looking from the

right sleep I don't like that it's going

oh my god built-ins the Grim Reaper

[Music]

report oh he's got a little hovering

beady eyes in there yeah he doesn't ever

he doesn't have a side three of those

are you carrying a ring it's cold in

your room sir are you sure I've got rich

do they all look the same as that first

one you put it's a human thing it

happens

usually coming out of the shadows in

your room are these three suit like

forms themselves only slightly more

substantial than the shadows from which

they are emerging mm-hmm he said looking

for the [ __ ] shadow okay well they

like Monster Manual cards are they off

limit eyes they look like they were well

isn't and I shall have them out for the

Tizen note as you see you go first or

not all right I am I grabbed the

mandolin off the nightstand and I start

strumming a gentle tune and just this

kind of swirling mass almost like sort

of an aurora borealis type of thing

aurora borealis in your room in my room

hardly local sorry but starts like just

kind of swirling around in the ceiling

and this like this sort of gentle glowy

a little array of colors need make this

pattern that you might say is a tonic

yes each of them make a wisdom safe with

disadvantage what is the effect of

hypnotic better uh on a failed save

they're incapacitated and have a speed

of 0 Oh

incapacitated you said ok it's the

wisdom said with its disadvantage please

Wow why why disadvantage why you gotta

be like that it's a really nice mandolin

oh Stradivarius mm-hm

with this advantage that's number one

feels

number two what's I assumed to fails and

number three failed even if I add these

two numbers together haven't gotten

there right so you said it would take a

minute for me to Don my armor yes so

while they're staring stupefied ceiling

of my room I'm going to uh yeah yep I'm

going so I could probably barely see

them even yeah well there because it's

so dark in here

yes it's night it's almost like you're

aware there are figures there but you

can't make out any detail yeah all right

well I'm gonna I'm just gonna put on my

you said this is like early early

morning right it's it's probably an hour

before dawn okay cool so I'm gonna get

my armor on and I'm also gonna kind of

like see if I can like tell if these

guys are like wearing anything or they

like is there any signifying fact that

like they're just shadowy forms so I

have there's just nothing to discern

from that all right I'm gonna like I'm

gonna get my armor on and I'm not the

only sane person here am i here they

l'chaim person in this room in this room

correct you're the only senior officer

right here but there were junior

officers is there is like yeah how many

rank-and-file guys are left 20-something

alright so and what like 10 or dozen of

those are on the ship so right so does

that mean I just have the maybe a dozen

guys here all right yeah I'm gonna

gather my things and and we along you

create your sister yeah Mego okay I'm

gonna creep out of this room since it's

early morning and I'm gonna you grabbed

your stuff you cheaper stuff on I put my

arm around a robber ah okay and my

clothes I think it takes a minute to put

your armor on but how long does this

last

uh it lasts a minute submit maybe okay

so I don't they don't get a saving throw

at the end of each round I'm gonna I'm

gonna put my boots on

step one without boots and I'm just

gonna grab everything else naked I'm

wearing boots I'm carrying a mandolin a

rapier and one of these is like a door

or window where there is a window I

didn't draw it that is the door open to

the end that is a door into a closet

okay I'm gonna go out into the into the

inn and like look up and down the hall

see if anybody else is up if anybody

else is even around yeah there are other

members of the chaîne doing basically

same there doing oh I'll make it

something wrong naked the nuts okay but

there are some of them are like the door

to their room is open and the area there

they're engaged in bout whoa oh [ __ ]

okay um I'm gonna go help them okay I

mean yeah I'm gonna run over there are

probably gonna drop my armor and fight

in the buff we don't to graph this out

but yeah there's a there is a couple

there are a couple of members of the

chaîne who have already defeated the

shadows in their room but there is one

just two doors down from you that is

engaged in active combat with two shades

amazonica I'm sure you can go ahead and

attack all right two shades yes

it's two she's fighting two shades all

right so that's a ten plus eight is 18

attacking one of them armor classes

twelve okay and the other role is a

sixteen so

[Music]

the each would take ten damage okay and

they're both still up on their turn they

both attack the rank-and-file chain

member whom you recognize but you were

having a tough time remembering what the

guys name is they both attack him they

ignore you and they drain his strength

and he collapses to the ground and from

his body emerges another shadow uh-huh

so it's almost like I could just do this

and then here we are the other members

of the chain including two-shoes does

run up and they start fighting the other

now there are four shadows in the

hallway there's three shadows in here

but these guys are still time right yeah

well I was just saying like like if

there were two shadows fighting him and

then a third one however you were alone

and now there's other members of the

chaîne okay we refine these things don't

appear to be very tough like - shoes -

shoes calls out keep fighting don't run

all right yeah we'll keep fighting then

shall I

yeah it went they went and they did

their thing and now you may go are you

gonna pack the two that you already

attacked are you gonna attack the fresh

one who once was a member of the chain

that you just watched to die in front of

you and be brought back to undeath as a

shadow 26 I'm going to do the same thing

I did before I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm

gonna hit each of the each of the ones

that I already hit that and I said there

are a C's ten twelve twelve so I I hit

one of them uh I think you're all

damaged I hit one of them for another

ten that guy's dead I'm sorry all right

one of them actually both of them are

gonna attack you what's your what's your

naked ac15 what's your an AC with the

boots on your NC rented out they are not

able to goddamn two

for they are not able to get flanking

I'm unencumbered I don't write so so

freeing to shoot the two-shoes walks up

and she turns undead and when one of

them is turns into a smear and

evaporates leaving one fresh one and one

wounded with you all right I am going to

attack be wounded one that's a 12 plus 8

he takes uh 8 damage shed all right and

then I will attack the other one which

is I guess the fresh one

yeah the one that one that was some day

that you served in the train with yeah

we go is he still look like the chain

member is he just like I've missed misty

black ok yep she's a mentor literally

literally featureless shadow of a

formerly living person I'm gonna

actually okay so I'm with bonus action

I'm gonna shout a healing word at his

still body on the floor just to see if

that does anything to like it's at that

is that your action is that spell it's a

bonus action huh he regains hit points

equal to a 1 d 4 + 4 nothing seems to

happen it's as though you're casting

spell on a corpse very well then I will

attack the shadow that emanated from his

body that's uh 18 to hit and I'm gonna

burn a Bartok inspiration die to do a

defensive flourish to this tax so he

takes ten damage and my armor classes

back up 17 for next turn so he is alive

you only determine that I didn't miss

anything right he only did 10 damage

alright

he attacks when he hits and he gets a

crit whoa

[Music]

cover your junk you take 13 points of

damage and your strength is reduced by

one by one I didn't even need strength

anyways I think it affects your attacks

is it would if it wouldn't be works if

judge had that happen - yes - youth

charisma so I don't need to be strong if

I need have a different judge an

alternate judge anyway it would affect -

shoes - shoes will attack the remaining

person and - shoes gets 15 and - shoots

can definitely just six points in damage

so you took out two of them - she takes

out the other one and that clears out

the like seven or eight tutions will

lead a little battalion of soldiers into

this room and they'll dispatch these

guys all right and that clears out the

shadows hmm but there are dead bodies

all over the place

oh no every one of these shadows there's

a dead body

Oh only only three of them are members

of the chaîne the rest are rest of

civilians hmm man - shoes what the hell

we've been at that yeah captain do you

do you know what could have caused this

a curse occult on any an enemy Church

undead Undead

sir undead usually mean in my experience

an evil priest an evil priest or some

kind of otherworldly agent of orcas Lord

of undeath as she starts listing

anything she think of yeah anybody look

will hear that we may have pissed off

you can think of I don't I'm not right

sir I wouldn't know

evil Church that doesn't sound like

Abbot nothing would have been that angry

at us for

the search of the Church of st.

what's-his-name the aspirant yeah yeah

they didn't even turn any of those down

we didn't turn that was okay to turn

down that was only a few days ago well

I'm not there you know these ago

none of us are they don't know yeah but

simple REO the aspirant all right props

for remembering his name though that's

pretty good I'd write down all right

the the one of the members of the chain

approaches you as senior officer here

and says sir I found like they there are

the common room is was also hit and

those guys all woke up and that's where

two of the dead chain members were and

their bodies still are the other

civilians that died were in their rooms

like you were and on the floor there's a

broken window and on the floor is an

iron bar about football

okay I'm gonna check out this iron bar

just just a mundane iron bar is this

part to those no there's no you don't

get any see you're human you don't get

any sense of magic radiating from it or

anything else it sound like a blank card

well was it was uh can I make the

assumption that it was thrown through

the window as an implement of breaking

the wind I can't stop you from making

that assumption tonight how can I like

try to investigate I mean yeah go ahead

yeah I mean I don't want a rolling like

yeah whatever whatever click conclusion

you might come to is a thing that boots

might think right yeah silver it might

be wrong but it's reasonable for boots

shadow knows there's some something

appreciate does I could cast the spell

on someone sleeping out here maybe do

you think tissues tried pay attention

let's don't make it to shoes can't look

at you she's some type of prude she

would she's like I can't look you right

now could you get dressed please

oh right yes I've kind of forgotten

actually so I'm run down the hallway and

grab the the the inn was closed when

this happened so the stone gen that runs

the place and his dwarf buddy you have

to be roused and they are they are angry

and they're mostly angry and they want

to blame you folks and is there certain

that this would never happened if you

guys hadn't picked this place to have

your party hmm and buts says you don't

know that this could have been a

completely complete coincidence we don't

even know what happened you're jumping

to conclusions it's not very scientific

and it really sends the dwarf to go get

the cops all right that's a good idea

and within about an hour the cops will

there will be cops here

it'll be gold buttons here investigating

what the heck is going on all right I

want to take what are you guys doing a

wonderful night at the Pharaohs 300

makeup and I'm ordering the boy around

take I'm gonna take butts into shoes

with me and go to the Pharaoh's dream

and leave whoever the rank-and-file guy

sure that the stone giant insists that

you guys stay until the cops get here

yeah you're not going anywhere I'm

leaving no you're not a ranking officer

in charge a junior officer he'll give

you a full report I need to I need to

recoup with the rest of my men you can

go wherever you want once the cops are

done with you

I have to go wherever you want gives us

huge booming voice once the cops are

done with you I'm gonna I want to try to

persuade this guy that leaving ox here

in my stead is just as good as oh go

ahead make a make a persuasion check Oh

God

man he's tough to persuade huh

that's uh well it's still a fourteen Wow

four plus ten Wow

fourteen mm-hmm no he is not he is not

persuading he's gonna stand in front of

the door he goes no one leaves well this

guy's understandably upset like I'm not

gonna try and I'm not gonna train this

film let me play you need to see us my

people yeah

you're dressed now right yeah well I

hope he's actually that big yes that's

awesome mm-hmm

how does he wait is he behind the bar

this place like the ground floor is like

20 feet tall it sounds like a it's like

a it's like a mead hall yeah but the

other floors above it he can't fit up

then that's what the Dwarfs that's great

I love that um yeah he's like no one

leaves no one leaves until the cops come

here

so back at the Pharaoh's dream you guys

meet not sure one seconds if you guys

meet down and Hanging Gardens wearing

your not not most elaborate cuz that

hasn't been delivered yet but your fancy

your fancy clear fancy off-the-rack

clothing I don't have that correct no

you're just you're just leech this

ship's surgeon blood-stained scrubs it's

well I would have cleaned up a bit I

wanted OD babe first he's getting a bit

punky yeah my worried [ __ ]

Reginald Orfeo the lawyer is already

down there original that's the day I'm

dumb guy yeah yeah nice yeah yeah he's

got a breakfast laid out in front of him

large table there were other nests down

here but he's off in a corner on his own

and once you approach you know people

look at you when you walk through you're

still not you still stick out your gif

right for instance you're a you're a

fiend of summer you're a devil Walker a

double man so we're not aware at all

what happened to boots how would you be

well that's on the other side of town

yeah but it's the next day and it's

happening like within about an hour yeah

it's not the next day it's not the next

day this didn't happen last night this

happened this morning this happened like

right before dawn and this is you know

now or after that so at some point

you're gonna find out yeah yeah it just

seems weird that we wouldn't be like for

the [ __ ] boots

you don't know he stayed there you know

that he's like I would stay here but

when he doesn't show up for our our

breakfast meeting yeah fine and Danny

goat cellphones experience consuming

boots has not been a senior officer very

long you had some awareness of boots his

reputation as a junior officer is he

punctual is he let's see somebody you

can count on to show up at at meetings

and stuff or is it would you say it's

reasonable to expect him to kind of

based and I addictive excuse I'd expect

the lieutenant of the chain be there for

me for client I mean you were the lumen

absolutely chronic right some [ __ ]

words like it's it's if your experience

with boots is no man boots a super

punctual he would never miss a meeting

like that then it's reasonable for King

to have to have a reaction like where

the [ __ ] is boots like something's

happened but if you're like ah it's

Boots's just I shouldn't let him stay at

the end three guardians is ready come

here's a real dinner if that not be the

most realistic all on how punctual is no

because it's King he's the one making

its Kings I think I think I would send

somebody to go get them because the

commander in lieutenant are the people

who deal with jobs so then I'll send the

concierge will be happy to go send a

runner to the it's gonna take a while

it's on the other side of the on the

other side of this part of the district

it'll go he'll go fetch a limo fetch

your lieutenant well as you approach the

table that Reginald Orfeo is sitting at

you can you smell this musty like

mothball dusty smell and he's got a

large breakfast laid out in front of me

he just takes tiny little bite signals

and then with gestures for you to join

him all of us yeah we know sitting as

one yeah - I received your message is

the job complete yes it'll be successful

yes well then put a bag on the table he

takes the bag you give it to him I put

him from me he'll take the bag okay

where's her payment he's gonna put that

on the table I'm merely confirming are

you gonna stop him from reaching your

kid he's gonna reach for the back you

just want to make sure you have your

part of the deal

does he have any boxes without me

brought a [ __ ] coffin with him last

time I'm like here's a sword and the no

he doesn't have any boxes with him I'll

take it out and put it on top you're

gonna take it out now here man standing

around no whatever he looks at it seems

satisfied it's not huge it's not you're

just not the Bob Vila but it is

expensive it sound like a king's crown

it's a Dukes crown he puts it on the

table and he pulls out a small like

notebook it looks like a cheque

so at five you guys can afford lots of

stuff and there are a lot of things you

can afford though you could now afford

like I would like get plate mail for

money okay fine

and you don't even have to deco that is

not enough money to cause the the die to

decrement you can just do it did we are

able to take over that cat that keeper

Castle I think that's what we're gonna

do the Citadel have you not seen the

broadsheets oh of course I you've been

gone the broadsheets okay like snap and

get like oh yeah somebody let me think

yeah so you get a broadsheet and the

headline says battle in the Citadel

mm-hmm oh God a group of cell sores

known as the shooting star clash with

the Pirates who dock you PI the Citadel

for months it is unknown who if anyone

the star are working for but they claim

to be serving the public good then it's

a core these Pirates were ruining trade

costing people a lot of money the Stars

leader rogar was quoted as saying we

figured we could help out the city and

the Pirates power probably had a lot of

loot so everybody wins

make a make an investigation show ooh

no no just judge 14 there's another

article on the front page of the broad

sheet

15 dead and stays tavern the name of

this day's tavern yeah and it's the one

that I know that boots and then we're

circumstances mr. premising hello yes

know who carried out this attack why

which attack are we talking about the
