ocean seller I am going to the Underdark

and I require your strongest potions

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

hello Joe thank you for joining us if

you are choosing to spend the next

couple of hours with us we deeply

appreciate it we're just much nerds sit

around playing D&D when last we left or

you'll notice that our friend Phil is

absent but he will be rejoining us next

week and I believe that some D&D

happened while you folks weren't

watching because you you didn't come to

lunch for a reasons passing

understanding and so hopefully the

players will be able to recap their

thought process and the decision they

made that led them to the title of the

episode that we have tonight so what

happened what happened wars are the

three jobs and what was your thinking on

why to pick which Corps not pick the

other so we had the what was at the

Herald Rick whatever group that wanted

us to go find the thing signed by the

Prince saying that these other people

were noble families with the one for the

monk that was going to get us in with

the guild that runs this area well at

least get them in with that guild saying

that they're gonna be with ya and then

we had the one from the sketchy sexist

dude he would prefer with the coab

referred to as traditional traditional

[Laughter]

[Music]

yeah so why did you pick that job he's

gonna pay us a lot and he's got good

connections that are gonna help us

establish ourselves here also cuz we're

just so excited to go back to the

Underdark

yeah we are below fairly well you can go

out the other darkest I think that's a

perfectly good colloquial term for what

is otherwise an abstract concept I mean

we didn't spend enough time down there

it has a solar wind panel and uh

Alejandro and darinka so we just we just

go back last time I went to the

Underdark we came back with our own

living squid ship

for plan was the other completely don't

place as you will soon learn potato

different potato so so you guys are

going to you guys want to take the

Underdark job yep and we got it going so

we go get the the crown right ground

yeah so we gave you a list of provisions

that we wanted so how are you gonna so

yes correct

you gave it you you gave that to me how

are you gonna get that to revenant

getting to the revenue we had the white

card we got to call them yeah got a good

news that we give it to the concierge

okay you get you give the white card to

the concierge and the concierge just

like what what is this and you take some

things oh yes I will

like whose corn is that I don't care

assume it's a it's a law firm it's the

card of a notorious somewhat notorious

local if I wouldn't call with notorious

hey old and respected

spected law firm any names the name of

it in one of the names is Orfeo and so

it's somebody somebody in Orfeo

attorneys at law they might be called

solicitors I don't know what they would

call these kinda Junction because it'll

take it'll take a while to because there

are there in the city proper and they're

kind of always so it's it'll probably

take a day to arrange a meeting with

this guy okay everything okay Jerry I

just heard ah yeah apparently not okay

there's no word from the from Mission

Control so yeah there you guys are free

to hang out in if the Pharaohs dreamin

capital and eat well and enjoy the

furnishings or go look up stuff and

explore things and probably get items we

need well that's what you're trying to

do that's what you're trying to arrange

your meeting and then so the next day

the revenant will come to the Pharaohs

room okay and he will and you you know

your well your your body servants will

knock on the door and say you're the

person you requested to meet with us

here he's down

in the restaurant we go down to the

restaurant he's got a chest with him

it's he's got a couple of Les together

looking undead with him

wait let's together looking as in like

yeah much more dead much more dad

they're all definitely dead how much

more did can he be basically like

decently dressed zombies yeah but

there's like skin falling off not this

guy this guy he's wearing he's he's

wearing sort of the the lawyer that

you're dealing with dresses and what we

would consider a kind of generic

business outfit but that is grossly out

of place in capital nobody else dresses

like this was like a double-breasted

suit it's all grey there's not a tie but

he does have like a silk shirt on

underneath it and so he would stand out

even if he wasn't yeah and the chest is

is it's longer

it's about as long as this table I would

guess table by the way table yeah it's

but it's it's it's only like the other

dimensions are not as huge is this okay

so interesting

he is sipping tea does anybody like it's

anybody else in the restaurant kind of

just like the hell are these guys doing

here um no okay no although there's no

one sitting in the tables near this guy

well they poison well I mean are you

gonna go you don't smell anything they

don't they don't they don't reek it's

not like you're walking into an abattoir

mausoleum I'm smelling mothballs are

some I mean this you may remember that

when this guy spoke a moth did fly out

it's not a bad idea though you should he

would be snacking on mothballs be the

reason we do well-preserved I am a mere

I did not come up with that but he he

sees you walk in and puts his P down and

sits back and waits for you to sit at

the table

are all of you there yeah okay

I'm like Freshlyground got my horns

shaved a bit really is that a thing that

judge has to do is right sure yes yeah

you don't go crazy you don't go crazy

here's my brain um yeah probably a lot

of beef flings a key fling says happened

here would you like to order

what's with the box I received a request

I received your request of course the

things you asked for are far beyond the

question I thought it was a fantastic

amusement on your part

very well done he's talking about like

the sword enchantment install go on it

on the list yeah okay but I did bring

some equipment that I believe will be of

use to you excellent what you got like

that - so the day that Grune like zombie

right they can't speak like him correct

like Billy from hocus pocus yes like

that character from that thing I don't

know anything anyway yeah and they open

it up and there is there's a couple of

things in here there's a sword oh it's a

great sword no and they kind of like

model it it's a it's old and thin really

nice and it's made out of this

a weird kind of purplish tinted gray

metal which if you guys are familiar

with exotic metals

you'll recognize as the star metal which

is kind of dwarven steel also known as

adamantine oh very nice

you'll be needing this don't ask me why

[Laughter]

this is me asking you

yeah yes I wasn't man I me oh no man

doesn't pretty magic you're you don't

notice you don't notice that telltale

well actually like there is when he

opens the chest you do get that that

whiff of ozone that humans you wouldn't

know you wouldn't called ozone it would

just be this metallic tinge to the air

the whole like hair standing on end that

happened as soon as you walked into that

hmm so you and you are aware that you're

already you're aware in the presence of

undead when he opens the box you

definitely get this the smell of what

where's the thing that you associate

with magic but it's not the so when you

get those when you take a look at the

sword if you inspect it

it's obviously not from the sword well

so it's just okay and he said don't ask

what for well I mean how many things are

swords used for cutting you're not right

he gestures to his undead servants and

they each produce a from the from the

chest they each produce a scroll through

Scrolls there are Scrolls of water

breathing all right oh my god okay going

swimming yeah and he produces a wand and

this is the source of the magic what

what manner of wand might this be it

enchants your weapons what type it the

enchantments temporary Oh

still was a wand of magic weapon it has

eight charges okay so I believe you can

look up magic weapon in The Player's

Handbook I believe lasts an hour and it

turns your weapon into a plus one weapon

cool yeah the research thing or does it

do the normal research thing it won't

it's a charge isn't it's not you will he

will tell you that he also he says that

he had his sages they had this map ready

and now they've accepted the job Ashley

he's pong I have to drop a contract

forgot hmm he draws up a contract it's

like signing okay judge is gonna read

over the contract okay is anything in

there and that looks a little

questionable there's a lot of legalese

in this make an inside check judge is

lawful yeah but you're not a lawyer come

on man you could have played a tiefling

lawyer but you decide you want to play

an ogre

can I make a trick dude you said I'm the

second best everything

there's words on it 14 it agrees to pay

you agrees to play the it agrees to pay

a chain of Akron and it lists your names

have been in also other Claude it's kind

of the same as the contract that the the

commander signed for was Lady cereal

that says like even if we all die then

the chain is still obligated to do this

hold into if like this dude eats it

finally it's the his farm he's already

good I know that's where you need it

we've been through the none more dead

thing he brings you yeah the contract is

just as they'll be payment of twenty

thousand gold pieces upon return of the

crown of house it says the crown of

house of Valletta

how do you spell that what's about like

it sounds it's a V with a letter at the

end v-a-l-e TTA I think you'll find

everything is in order he said do you

say so so tell us more about this lake

alright so boots though they'll bring

you know bring breakfast

YUM and a glass of breakfast wine please

and is there a rec first one yeah okay

would you see the breakfast Brian menu

Oh bring you a menu so orange juice had

more than one breakfast wine this is

amazing we've got a wide selection did

he provide the way for us to you yeah he

has unfortunately the map I Ord Matt the

Matt Matt Koval order does not arrive so

just well when when this goes live will

edit in it and call everybody over on

Friday it was a sit around and pretend

to be it's gonna be amazed by this way I

ordered a map actually like a so we'll

see but yeah it provides a map that if

you give this to your navigator it

should allow you to reach it reached the

the I don't know if you I don't have he

calls him coordinates but the

coordinates in the in the you know well

the the question I was going to ask was

to talk to our guys that we're leaving

here okay it's some sort of sending

stone a method to talk to them between

plants what we're out that's on you how

about well if you if you if you complete

the job he'll get he'll you'll get

access to other stuff lie and he'll tell

you that he'll say that like you know

upon completion of the job you'll have

access to some of our considerable

resources and the opportunity for more

work in the future for now we didn't

know that we're working with right

people

I guess you know we'll get in get out

yeah quick in and out was it Susie yeah

but I guess you're worried Lars is once

we're in you still want to be able to

communicate with I just want to

communicate be able to communicate with

you shoes but right it's fine

kind of like how I think I'm sending

isn't something that you talk yeah spell

slot it's rough but you cannot you can

do it yeah it's possible do retainers

get that spell I don't know if there's a

retainer that gets sending probably not

I think so we tried to make those

because they're so few spells that you

could probably not always combat bird up

that's really effective for sending is

very very situational but like stuff

with pass without race is really good

quite often so there's a character that

has that um oh but I mean he would be

mmm

given that sending is a third level

spell he's gonna assume that he's hiring

people that have access to it and that

if they don't then he's think he's

talking to the wrong people

hmm well tell us more about the like

it's full of water out do you know if

the crown you said there was an island

in the middle the lake do you know if

the crown is situated on the island or

is it within we don't know okay any

other details us too like the

whereabouts of the crown the creature

you know do you know who took a tour

like the circumstances by which it was

lost it is our understanding that the

crown is in a position of being referred

to somewhat theatrically as the lord of

madness sounds like his the lord of

madness the only one that occupies the

island nor is there any you haven't me

it's somewhat of a disadvantage mm-hmm I

was born here and I pride myself on

having never left the city walls what's

the name of the lake again it's the

sunless sea that's what he calls it

maybe have other news

it's working on how I'm feeling here

Phil I know I asked you yeah bill come

back to Philly gap that's the that's the

symbol of theirs awesome player yeah

there you go character s an adorable

bird if there's anything else I can do

for you I'll be happy to provide mm

access to any number of things once you

return with the crowd what about the UH

deer your potions all a bit uh oh yeah

do you um

do you know of any potion shops around

here

but we might acquire some very strong

potions I mean like I don't know if I

don't know if boots would ask that

because boots knows you can't just walk

into the stores and buy potions

no that that's the thing that's the

thing most people know like there's this

isn't there's no poke this is an

addition man you can't just walk around

in a city and expect to buy magic shops

but there are like weeds like I think

we've talked about where there are

places where you can buy magic there are

places you can probably get very

powerful magics but they're all like

exclusive clubs they're not stores right

it looks like from the inside looks like

a store but do you have a membership and

that guards and stuff like that and I

think I get back yeah this is another

visitor tom question yeah it doesn't

seem like there's that much of a use for

you you were saying that like potions

aren't really very useful in combat I

think know you can potions are good for

bonus actions so if you're if you're

hurting yeah they're definitely helpful

okay yeah cuz you can fight he was

saying move and that dealing is not yeah

like clerics Clarence aren't they it's

the game is no longer designed so that

you're constantly taking damage in the

clerics job is to constantly heal you

out of combat much better yeah but uh

and if you burn higher little spell

slots it can't be better but yeah is

there any concern that upon our return

that we might face some some issues with

house olara or navara through customs

and in the Navy having our ship searched

and having them potentially confiscate

this crown they would never

are you certain about that yes as long

as you're sure we can always show them

the contract yeah I'm just thinking of

this crown is of some importance some

you know entrepreneurial fellow yeah

it's gonna say ooh that's another good

question

um do you by any chance know if for any

reason there would be other parties

interested in also acquiring this crown

just so that we know to look out for

let's say interlopers if you read your

contract

you'll see that there is a

non-disclosure segment of it if someone

were to ask me if the chain of Akron

we're currently pursuing any work for us

including searching for the chain with

the crown I assure you I would tell them

but I had no knowledge of such a thing

likewise if you already have a group out

there looking for this crown you

wouldn't divulge that information to us

I'll be deeply unprofessional of course

not

very good but certainly had we done so

and they succeeded we would not be

talking to you you know that makes sense

well they bring you your breakfast wine

is it a mimosa thank you it's a rosy

well this is what we're doing so I

signed the contract okay well this was a

contract done done as soon as you as

soon as you're done signing he snatches

it away from you pulls it up with some

minutes well where's my copy we need two

copies of a copy made and sent over

immediately

do you have cell phones we need a

picture

Danika Adobe yeah that's good yeah

make me write in blood what an idiot

he's not demon we're looking me for it I

don't know no no reason so yeah alright

so you guys are on the hook to do this

thing

now what let's call the troops together

okay right is our pip or isn't what no

he was checking to see if you're drunk I

don't drink so it's impossible don't

drink why yeah so know what mmm-hmm

we're gonna go to the strip and we're

gonna call uh the train together gather

them up okay they assemble you guys make

you guys you have no problems leaving

the city and getting from the outside

from the inside to the outside it's only

when you cannot get to show your papers

so guys freely walk down from the

Pharaohs dream we wait for a contract to

get delivered to us by do this well

that's copy that's gonna take like a day

so yeah I mean it take like well

actually now that I think about it no

cuz there

these are wealthy these guys would

probably use K carpet particularly

related in a couple hours

isn't the if the contract if we're under

NDA as a result of this contract like

does this mean that we also can't talk

about the fact that we're on this thing

like a to 8 yeah you what the couple

with the clause says is that you can't

say who you're working for

right you can say hey we're looking for

this crap right cuz I can't say you

can't say you can't say it first of all

the crown the only thing the contract

says is that you're working for this

legal part their proxy proxy that's

right middleman so but it does this by

explicitly says that forfeiture of

forfeiture of all earnings upon

disclosure of the company we got it okay

you get I'm also gonna go upstairs and

change back into my armor okay I was

wearing my fancy duds for breakfast you

guys head out to the somnium to neveress

who's on who's on the boat whose garden

it was it was tennis shoes and run point

and then we have a crew yeah a crew okay

sure yeah yeah so about two shoes

salutes a dozen of drunk rank-and-file

guys yeah cook should have been back by

this point with supplies and foodstuffs

yes and a couple days yeah absolutely

yeah yeah like a little little worried

if she wasn't I would be judge would not

the crew already all right it's all team

is it are you while you were calling

like ox and Angel we're calling all

that's an all okay i'll 20 cuz we're

gonna tell them we're gonna go on a

mission okay ever gonna tell them what

we need them to do while we're gone okay

all right then yes okay so you're gonna

contact the other members of the chaîne

who are in the city of the other than

the other in and tell them to meet you

at the at the at the song contest on the

ship yeah and then you guys go to the

ship and now everybody's there yeah and

they're in anticipation of finding out

what the hell's going on

mm-hm maybe we're getting hell out here

maybe we're leaving capital good I hate

this place they don't hate it come on

they'll love it

some of them like it some of them like

I've never got to see it man I've been

on the ship for the past two days mm-hmm

so we got a high paying job senior

officers are going to go on a mission to

the world below to retrieve a crown a

couple of groans collected soldiers am

everybody's not going everybody's I

decided on a new lieutenant hmm myself

myself

boots knows capital the best and he can

help us with setting up and getting jobs

done here he knows the city knows the

people oh this is handy - yes oh right

yeah this was yeah that's a good being

with lieutenant as a reminder as a

reaction to a senior officer rolling

initiative I may swap two officers

initiative results once per I guess I

guess once per battle it doesn't say

that but doesn't necessarily need to

because how you don't be only roll

initiative what's about so anyway yeah

so there's like a yeah there are some

clapping good job while we're on this

mission undisciplined [ __ ] they're

gonna do the [ __ ] like name like

salute man this isn't like some kind of

real military these guys are these guys

are mercenaries who takes out a sword

yeah yeah the best part of this I mean

the only reason we do this is now

basically pretty much yeah while we're

gone to shoes is gonna be on point in

town and the people saying here she

salutes well sir you can somebody go

yeah of course it's me

[Laughter]

we're gonna take slim in the crew of the

ship with us on this mission and we're

also gonna take a leech we're also gonna

take leech because leech is your

resident under dark expert yeah all

right resonator a drow oh here he comes

out of the crowd of soldiers drought

steps forward mind the camera hey I'm

minding I'm mining

I hope chats being spammed yeah he's

he's he's here's to that me have been

interrupted in the middle of something

and he's up to his elbows in this thin

pink looking blood that's also spattered

all over him

good day in surgery yes I've been

looking after my ship your ship says

what does leach look like I am about 6

say the colors of the chain oh yeah well

he's got a little thing is just a mile

marker well just we're testing to see if

he was magnetic cool they're used so

what is your your ancestry is drought

what is your class I'm a water and what

is who is your patron

what is your base Celeste you celestial

pager yes social patron mmm-hmm well you

are the chains resident expert on the

Underdark so you will be joining them

you are not six level like the rest of

the chain you're only junior officer so

we've made you a fifth level character

thank you

so uh leach is one level behind your

buddy to represent the fact he's not as

dope as the other guys Thanks while

we're going focus on small jobs and

recruiting and ox assist a two-shoes

with the Treasury well we're gone ox is

the dragon Foreman yeah do we want to

get it exchanged mm-hm yeah we're gonna

have to choose exchange it and post up

in the dream

herself really we're getting all of our

treasure exchanged in city capital money

yeah we're staying a couple let's say

the least

why seems just seems like you know nor

money and somebody else's bank and I

really trust it well it's not the bank

it's you you still have it it's up to

you guys do you guys are you saying but

a positive in a bank or you saying just

convert it to capital capital right so

you're still good you got a big chest of

paper now paper and coins instead of

gold nickels if you want she's like

monopoly money you just for capital I'm

not it's real it's real it's real cops

and we have to like fly the coop it's

not like we can stop up at the bank

really by the way let's just do this

conversion real well it depends on where

you go there are lots of places almost

every major city in Jordan will either

take capital currency or converted into

them crazy because it's kind of like the

hardest currency because capital is the

only literally the only suit sitting in

the world with a monetary policy okay so

it's not quite not only money no anyway

irony serves hurt in any way need to go

to surgery

he looks after in anyway you you think

your stomach was hurting right I know

you've been away for some time

they'll all go to various Inns and

taverns and whatnot do you know about

the Sun we'll see

yes sir it's a sea that never ends okay

I thought you're gonna say it was a sea

without a Sun

that's selling that Sun all right you

may see what some people cool stars

interesting stars just another language

lady do you have any idea where the Lord

of madnesses the lord of madness the

Lord of madness on sunless sea he's on

the Isle of madness I guess I guess

that's where we're going you want to go

something that we're after right

sirs very powerful missio trial he's a

great one oh here's another one an old

he's pretty great he's great an old

great an outcast at the bottom of an

inverted tower on the Isle of madness

sirs very very powerful okay we already

killed one gun sergeant problem it's a

bit soon commander he says may I be

dismissed to clean up some what I've got

some parts of my work still on my

clothing I mean I suppose what you how's

the ship doing the ship is a living

thing I'm caring for it I'm trying to

find out how it lives how it's fueled

how I can make it better

it's my our ship so I wants to take care

of it for us all how does one feel about

how he's talking about the ship

how does slim feel about how leach is

talking about the ship

keep saying mine I mean he would like

raisin ah he would love raise a

nightmare at that but he doesn't really

he know he knows what this guy's just a

junior officer so he's like whatever

that's caring for it I pat the side of

the ship it's some kind of stroke it's

it's it's I don't know if you were here

for this but it's like this rubbery it's

like a whale's skin uh-huh

it's it's warm so it's not that yeah

yeah I just straight out just just

gently that's so sirs cannot be

dismissed actually slim if you said my

ship you correct yourself like but he

would be like my ship yeah yes sir of

course

boots goes Disha all right well we give

Slim the UH the chart all right you guys

disembark you're the somnium to numerous

leaves its birth and the ship you feel

like shudder as it starts there it has

its own because it's a living creature

is its own kind of propulsion

it doesn't need to use it sails if it's

really slow I'm out without them it's

kind of like the difference between

impulse speed and likes warp speed

so it basically turns around starts

swimming out to sea and slim gives the

slim connects to the navigator reads the

chart so the navigator can see through

some eyes and begins the process of

transferring between walls

punch it slim slim gets into the captive

the pilots oh hey wait a minute you're

the ship's surgeon it is yes I have to

decipher this looks like in Hebrew it's

just got wear glasses that's all our

printer family out of ink no no

sweet see here yeah yeah you want to

tell everybody what it does yeah so

here's the title ships surgeon

I am the ship's surgeon I gain

proficiency with medicine

once per battle as a reaction when an

ally drops unconscious you gain a free I

believe that says movement you must move

towards the unconscious ally ally and

end your movement adjacent to them you

may all spend a hit die yeah that's what

it does okay I get free I get a free

movement to go games it only when

someone's unconscious is how I read that

and then it comes out unconscious I can

pick them up well I've got I have a

spell called healing light which is a I

don't have to use a spell slop for I get

like let me work remember now 66 that I

can use I use 3 at time mattress save

judge was down I could go go for it but

even with you know you don't like you

can get them up without having to use

any of those because that lets them

spend your time oh what's the target

ah got it you get when you get diamonds

around them they can you can use your

surgeon skills in a abstract way not

covered not explicitly detailed in your

ability to kind of patch them up and get

them to consciousness and back in the

fight oh sweet and then I can move out

of there off that well then you're not

even then your that's your that's a

reaction so it's not so reaction means

because obviously on your turn these

guys don't go unconscious right they go

unconscious on the bad guys turns so a

bad guy does something I'm really and

judge goes unconscious and then it's not

your turn but you get to react to that

got it then you run across and you go

yeah and they get up and they get to

spend it die and then you're done that's

it and then the bad guys keep going oh

yeah your ally is now no longer

unconscious

got it can I uh under sheet yes so

missing the medicine thing yeah thank

you because yeah I got I'm yeah cuz I

said are you doing an ID in the ability

yeah yeah yeah I got these these are

these are the dice that Anna got me as a

present right she does do nice things

some time

really yeah she eventually got you

though yeah yeah let's say weird

he asked us she asked I'll get to quit

she asked me a few others what your

favorite color what's your favorite

color

and I say red and someone else is blue

ways so we sat there and a neat guy says

hey I've got you two dice everyone here

goes she puts the dice out in front of

me Reno's bags nothing nice yeah this is

really nice nice nice case and she puts

me from in a blue and and where's he's a

red and I said I like red or Macy like

Boop and ladies like these are great

thanks a lot and I'm like Anna I said I

like red these types are very nice yeah

but chief I'm sorry it's what Darrell we

coming in anyway but some of that to say

something yeah yeah

so yeah the slim gets in the tits in the

pilots chair and leans back and the

tubes come out and start to interface

with his brain and you have that

experience of the ship is sailing and

it's sea air coming in through the ports

and then the walls first the veins in

the walls start to glow brighter and

brighter they're they're usually a

fluorescent pink color until eventually

the whole wall starts to glow and

everything becomes white this blinding

blinding white light and then the light

goes away and you're in another world

and you can't be the only thing you can

tell is that it gets cold suddenly the

temperature drops it's about like 45

degrees and you it's the you could sort

of here before the transition

you could hear waves you know you could

hear seagulls now you don't hear

anything

let's go you now you this is of course a

perfectly comfortable temperature yes

because this is the constant 45 degree

temperature

all of the underdog all right I take my

jacket off for who says we're here yeah

I could tell

I'm freezing so like looking out from

like on top of ship - what do we see

around us it's dark so like if you were

anywhere where sunlight was coming in

before most of the somnium - new versus

is a windowless interior but there are

ports and windows and if you go out you

see that it is it's going to take a

while for your eyes to adjust unless you

have dark vision but it's very very dark

you're on a flat almost the glass-like

see but once your eyes start to adjust

there is a glow coming from the water

and it is it takes all it takes a while

but you start to notice things you start

to notice a little like almost like

floaters in your eye these little

objects darting in the water they're

mostly worms that fluoresce there are

fish that glow if you look up you see

what appear to be green stars but

otherwise it's it's incredibly dark is

it's like the sea at night and it's you

have this sensation it's hard to

describe but the sound like any like

there's very little sound any sounds you

make just art but they disappear they

just there's no echo there's nothing it

feels like you're in a giant room as

opposed to a world I have an imp with me

familiar what is your kid's name most my

name's name again I forgot you know it's

honestly it's Odie does it that man

there it doesn't have the face of a

cockney get

is it a little version of the player

he's very excited to be here he's like

leaping up and down he tugs on me hmm

he's he's tormenting me he's like a like

a child this light

dad dad we're here kind of thing what is

what languages does your in Inferno and

something else PK just comment I can't

find it now I think it is car yeah I

guess you photo in common yes common

yeah so you hear the babbling imp

crawling as it crawls all over you start

I kind of try and shoot him off I'm not

trying to ignore what I haven't

forgotten

don't worry about him he's very

excitable so as to be home no judge is

gonna ask man infernal who's gonna find

him I don't understand our our sound

technology that just abused different

battery yeah so at this point of the

ship can get around but you're gonna

have to navigate it and really what is

your I thought we had the map yeah so

does another Matt and if the map doesn't

get you to the island that the map gets

here between dimensions okay we start to

find an island yeah the map is the map

is a the map is a map of the multiverse

that specifically has a chart that gets

you to so the Navigator looks at lower

we need to correct a boy it does it does

get you in the general area of the thing

so if you're like trying to get to New

York City it'll get you in the right

you'll get you in the vicinity of like

Manhattan but you could still be miles

away it's just 90% get us under the

under has these ship been here before

has the somnium to never spin here

before yeah I'd assume I don't and in

these waters I am NOT

or if the somnium to neveress is smart

enough to remember where it's been

well what about slim but navigator

navigator is not it not slim I don't

think sums ever been to the I don't

think slim has ever not been in the

astral sea can your Impa turn into

something that can fly yeah I believe so

yes he can he has in terms into a raven

shape change the aim could use his

actions probably morph into a beast form

that resembles could be a rat a raven a

spider that's it the rumen alights on

your shoulders you will be punished so

maybe we could use OD to scout around

[Laughter]

but maybe we could use OD to scout

around and like flying and you could see

through and perhaps we could find out

where the where we should be going from

here yeah go ahead and make a thing

actually let me do it because I don't

want you to know if you failed or

succeeded it will color your reaction to

what is your survival skill modifier

look at your skills on the right side

your key for tracking it's not great no

it's under pen for navigation can I give

him uh what D for on that my life

survival I don't have him is zero

yeah you have no bones to your son would

he be using his own or would he be using

Odie's wisdom modifier so he generally

using his yeah I mean he's he's the he

doesn't have so leech leech has Aleta

has never been here before

leeches this is this is the universe

that leeches from legions never been

down here don't be ridiculous

this is where the old ones so he's just

gonna try to do his best to guess at

what dice perchik okay I think you're

long t20 is I was just

advantage or what someone make sure he's

guys does it actually give me the give

me Jerry Jerry I'm warning you now I'm

gonna use the camera so your eyes don't

look at the if we if we behind the

screen if I put this here don't look

don't look over there there cuz like

that you'll be able to see you okay

alright okay now you can you can not you

can look now

Thank You Jerry hey Plus that was a

brief experiment with our cameras and me

rollin behind the screen and letting you

see what I roll and if I had thought

about it at a time I would have the

camera ready when I rolled but I was too

excited so perhaps next time anyway so

now the audience knows what you've

rolled and and I know what your world

but you do not so definitely definitely

leeches like yep I know where you find a

person is this anything like this isn't

well cuz back on or on the astral see

the Navigator had taught me how to

navigate this you'll see I don't know if

this is similar enough where I might

know some be able to help someone

navigating the seas I know which ways

north north but do you always know which

way is north

so do me a favor make an insight check

okay I know what to see at seven percent

like everything you remember about about

navigating on the astral sea he seems to

he seems to be growing exactly the same

regardless of isn't I check does he

always know which direction North is yes

okay so you would know if we were going

in a circle it and like oh that's

probably go for it doing that you're

definitely not going in a circle okay

again you're not going in the circle

this time

oh yeah that's true I wouldn't do that I

wouldn't pull that twice on the same

that's ridiculous

mm-hmm wouldn't all right so we're often

yeah you are so you are traversing the

sunless the aptly named sunless it

doesn't matter what time of day it is

obviously you're inside a giant cave

there was never any there was never any

Sun is there any tasty bits for the

somnium to never us to be eating as we

go

well the somnium Terrace is not like uh

it's not filter feeder yeah wires like

like dolphin sized stuff or burger it's

so far no good okay

I fed her well before we left he's been

he's been procuring food for the ship

and Fulton seeing how it reacts to

different foods mm-hmm what whatever

favor makes her stronger never favorite

she quite like shark's cartilaginous

yeah is there any uh food or the ship in

Missy well yes there is there is no

there's there is the same no there is

there is there is food there is there

are living things here but the somnium

tenaris prefers to eat stuff it's not

it's not a filter feeder yeah it cans

too small they can't eat nasty like

these things that are like dolphin sized

a beer and so far there's none of that

here

it's a little purple well this really

specific deja vu right

yeah when I was back at the ship looking

after her if I could have somehow got

people to fish so I've got a scholar

who's there yeah if I was I worried

about it right I want to make sure sure

especially on the docks there is oh yeah

you're right next to the fisheries and

you could just go have you know through

yourself you have the treasure you could

just have something to go by right a

whole bunch of and they're there the

fishermen often come back with stuff in

their nets that they can't sound like

sharks and stuff right we tell it's like

we weren't just fishing for this but

when you dump all

it's like how great so you'll be like

I'll take that off your hands yeah okay

yeah sorry yeah this I would have sucked

up some amount I don't know yeah sharks

are good all things sharks and dolphins

my favorites also she was on the astral

sea for a couple days before she started

showing any signs of you know wear and

tear yeah yeah I was curious what she

normally it's and in her normal plane

maybe maybe I miss that and I was

talking to Phil there is there are there

are you know there aren't creatures

native to the astral see that she eats

some very quite large there are huge

that would probably eat her

can this ship go can this ship submerge

mmm no the creature can but then you

would all drown interesting haha my two

Scrolls though yeah right one one one

spell of water breathing well that's not

abbreviate people you go scree go

Wolverines go yeah yes

we wanna they have two Scrolls of water

we do we still have that stuff of spells

hmm who has the huh I do thank large the

commander

yeah yeah don't lose that otherwise it's

gonna be hard to actually slim now the

Slim's the pilots Lemkin some can tell

is ship to be stuffed the command the

command staff lets you do it without

being telepathic alright so it takes

about an hour of navigation on this

silent sea and leach alerts you guys

that you're getting close to your

destination well yeah they're almost

here says the I love madness awaits us

you get this this overwhelming sense

that this is

looking this is where you're supposed to

be going this is like it was a good

thing you brought leach long you're

definitely definitely about to arrive on

the lair of this old one we did a lot of

madness yeah yeah by the Lord of

fabulous yeah that is definitely what is

about to loom out of the darkness and

indeed coming out of the darkness before

you are the shores of the pebbly knots

and their pebbles rocks the pebbly rocky

shore of an island by his judge nothing

why are you stopping me him only no

reason I'm just noticing that you're

playing around with your uh your your as

MODY alone and yeah you see the this

island it is pale it's got architecture

on it there are what appear to be seven

towers the island is relatively small

like you could probably walk across it

in about an hour and wait didn't you say

that the tower that the lord of madness

is in is inverted yes I mean meaning it

goes down write it down submerged

I'm guessing mmm-hmm is there a castle

on top of it that comes out like this

it's there are it's the the city the

small the outpost that this island is is

a ruin and part of the ruin is the

inverted Tower so there's there is like

more than one location on this island

one of these locations is the inverted

Tower which does go down well we are at

the right place that's he said there was

a couple uh couple of other towers as

well there's seven towers on the island

yeah there's no dock or anything there's

just

and there's no there are no waves

there's no tide there's no surf there

was just water running up to a beach a

beach made out of sand and pebbles we

and then rock and stone and then these

seven alien-looking powers that look

like they're almost maybe they could

they could be huge stalagmites growing

but there's several stories tall and

yeah should you want to use the

tentacles to get off on the off the ship

otherwise we have to swim I could say I

can semi him for a quick sky round I

think yeah okay unless he's got a

certain distance he can go I'm not sure

I don't think so I think is that he's

like and there's there might be arranged

with your communication but there's no

range to his flight you could just keep

going see ya range

how does let's let's figure this out

right now because I don't know I have

read it but I don't have an atomic what

does what is how do you communicate with

your familiar because I believe you took

the pack of the chain as your yeah

thingy and I believe that allows you to

like telepathically communicate with it

yeah no you're right

yeah it's the invocation it took back to

the chain master okay Sean it took

pacted the type of master yeah the

invocation back to the chain master yeah

again I don't know while it's within a

hundred feet of me I can communicate

with it telepathic so yeah you can tie

over a hundred feet I can't communicate

but he was still a bale I ordered what

about okay okay no he says familiars act

independently of me it will always obey

my commands Odie does it say does it say

does it say it will be in its operation

I think I can see through his eyes

together telepathically but I don't

think you can actually speak not at

school I think you can't talk with us

but I think yes right he sounds like

leach then yeah yeah

but I think that might be a hundred feet

well go fly around in each other okay

cats are you really my wisdom anything

strong with some shape correct yes yeah

I'm sorry

yeah yeah well you look at me like

that's on this stream and I rolled a 20

are you serious yeah no joke the first

two rolls I made were twenties and it

wasn't like Phil's first roll of twenty

I think you've seen a whole bunch of

like anyway yeah no rule again retire

now

oh my experience with you playing

definitely gave us kill by the way don't

bring out sorry congratulations so who

you got you got twenty you got a 20 yes

all right plus your whatever your wisdom

odd is 19 19 wait judge 13 you know plus

3 2 per say a robber

so you actually got 23 sorry 0.3 yeah

yeah 6 okay so you and King both see

this image of this island with seven

towers on it start to dissolve like it's

melting and there's an another image

behind

yeah well it's like a much much smaller

island when you get Bali walk across in

a couple of minutes and there's a giant

like it's as big as a song name to

neveress skull maybe half as big as a

song it's embedded in the island and

it's got hair that appears to be long

green strands that run out into the

water and it's just like it's that you

can't the skull is that's got whole

words noses and a couple of cavernous

eyes sockets it could be just

a stone formation that's been made to

look like a skull work could be a giant

skull and the the strands of seaweed

that make up its hair start to rise and

twist and reach out and grab the somnium

two nippers and it's gonna be initiative

you made me hard like that yes I wonder

if we could use the actual ship model Oh

since I can't see this apparently I'm

just gonna notice that everybody else is

taking up arms yeah I let you know that

there's strangers on the plan strangers

on the plane so this is like there's a

island it's probably fake that was a

fake and then there's a real one you

made your thing ready yeah yes I did I

got 23 of them mm-hmm that is that is

fitting considering you are the only

native right some you see can't patch up

dead people what is it

I say was that I mean he might call this

out before you get a chance for you did

he give you like a sheet of things or

something I'm giving it to him right now

oh I see here it is a sheet of many

things y'all hate it so we could prop I

don't know if it would be any easier

than actually I think that these these

things don't come out actually that's

cool I mean well I've made this by the

way I [ __ ] built this thing pass that

down od please it's amazing how much

work I put into this model considering I

think we used it for about five minutes

I remember thinking that you guys are

gonna spend a lot of time on it

well I mean to be honest I'm pretty

appointed that we went to a couple ends

and you made me built that [ __ ] in

well that's true

yesterday we haven't yet you have

another fight their house has no we're

doing on the summers model Oh actually

we've got a package today we have no

maybe this is it you got it

it was it was long it now go ahead the

ship where you want to be so I read your

did you read that map yes yes yeah I did

yeah

what are you gonna call it out I only

live a minute soldier put me on there

somewhere I think I hang around with you

I am got mini for my imp if you've got

one knocking around yeah Jays madhi's

when you've been you would probably be

with me up in me like what the captain's

cuz you're the one who actually knows

the area clearly I know it like the back

of my hand Breton nothing's going wrong

here so I think you would probably be up

there

okay dough yeah you put me wherever well

we're on the squid ship not there's that

so I'm next to a my necklace to next to

you should you appear shooting people

Paul yeah I kind of think I will you up

there though come on come on just next

to you it's just out to are they right

I'm gonna get call me see that way yeah

copper and big cutter up here yeah but

I'm stood next to you come on why not

a big cat [ __ ] house on them I don't

know how to get down well there's

probably a ladder yeah apologize are you

fun Adam anyway okay I guess kind of box

or something I'm just gonna move these

and not other people it's too late we're

faking it around

this thanks man it ain't a long time to

find his mini there's a big sigh they

look pretty good I mean you can kind of

see the deck of the ship there yeah it's

not yes it's terrible it's not swell

free if you have if you're exothermic

it's awesome

I guess from my spots

can I call out to everyone yeah thank

you

yes ever butchers I've gone playing

their first backup growling he needs to

zoom in

are you got it yeah you need to have a

quick look too old yeah that's him what

it gets me I get come here that's

exactly that's a good many that's he

always with me if I don't send him

somewhere irritating me almost tormented

if he's not talking to me he's pulling

at me and dislike of darkness look at

that that we there yeah we there yet

kind of big but he torments me about my

past you see out of the nasal cavity of

the skull you see running with unnatural

speed and they cross the water running

across the top of it as though they are

not of not not fully corporeal creatures

what appear to be a unit of ghostly

growl serfs we seem to have encountered

what one would describe as a memory

eater we may have been fooled on our way

here this could be somewhat of an

uncomfortable encounter

is the ship able to back up out of the

grasp of the tendrils you can try okay

yeah I mean it's still here at slim will

will it be in the and you can see that

as the tentacles reach out the Summum to

Nevers tries to get away but it's not

fast enough

these the tentacles are now that you get

closer there are a lot of them there are

hundreds of them and they're made out of

seaweed they're just these incredibly

long seaweed tentacles that wrap and

they get in everything they get in the

in the sails and they actually insert

themselves in through the cavities in

the ship and the rest of the crew are

gonna start hacking at these things no

you could spend hours hacking at them

and you would never get all of them then

I just just read out what is this no no

no no that's it no I could do that all

right up to you to describe it in

character based on your own memory of

what I wrote in your interpretation says

it's memory it's it tricks us it takes

on it gets in our minds it can see where

we would want to go it knew we were

looking for the the Isle of madness and

it takes that information and makes an

illusion that we all believed and so yes

it's tricks as this brought us here now

now we've seen its true form and here we

are

sirs am i uh i'm i can use great sports

am i using the adamantium great sword

should i ask to find out i'm king only

one yeah we probably should the more

research on that thing well what do you

know about enemy weapons like yes oh

that's what we need to revise your

weapon master ability i apologize we

haven't done that don't let me forget

between now and next week i'm just going

through an auditing all of the titles I

gave her boobie everybody to make them

so there are more they have greater

utility because sound like and as I

think we talked about this before on a

stream some like as sort of require her

to pay attention to what other people

are doing like other people because

she's the weapon master of you roll ones

that counts twos

but it's sort of it's it's it's it's a

bad ability if it requires you

constantly paying attention everybody

does can I roll can I can I use like my

my historical knowledge of weapons and

their materials to try and figure out

what the benefits of the adamantium I

mean you're the webmaster just now well

it's the the

star medal is it is a dwarven metal and

it's also used by the drow it's one of

the kind of one of the signs of them as

a fallen elf race is that they use this

heretical metal that the elves would

never use and it's just super good so

perfect metal like better than better

than steel better than it'll it's great

at cutting through objects so there are

a whole bunch for instance for instance

judge would know oh man we've been

graded we have these things when we were

fighting the balance spring oh I see her

like mechanical clock word kind of

materials anything anything like a lot

of constructs inorganic a lot of

constructs are they take half damage

from all of this stuff unless you have

magic weapons are or out of an tiem

woman's okay not ghosts no I don't think

so

okay so leach this memory eater you say

we've seen its true form is it it's uh

this tiny island itself no these are the

things now that are coming to kill us I

mean so you haven't seen the memory area

it's the you a pound its lair ah these

things attacking you who knows what the

hell those things are actually make a

make a history check you would know this

history I get plus one on that so you

telling me that these things that I did

you say that it wears out twenty eight

cocked over to to blimey

so for for she have no idea we're not no

idea what this is do you think they're

just more illusions but did you say it

with drow come

in fact obviously drought in fact I'm

sorry this DNA make a I want to remember

something check inside check inside in

saga naturally well I have by the way I

have

doesn't this yes look at this I stole

Anna's DM screen you did that's not

right

I've stolen has DM screen because I

needed to use it as a reference for a

running the game video I'm working on

and I just decided to continues me

because this DM screen is wave land way

better

yeah than the last one like the last one

had two whole panels of how to make an

NPC and I'm like I would like to know

what you can do and come back and it's

all here including skills on here I

don't have to keep asking the players to

see their character chase tournament

with all those skills can do anyway yeah

so so you already eaten failed a history

check yeah did I just ask you to make a

inside check I think he's heading inside

yeah and what was the result of that I'm

Donnie yeah okay well please do 20 not

know just to strike 20 well you need a

plus is if you can roll a 20 well yeah

you recognize these guys though yes

it's sir wall or and the company of the

silver scorpion these okay these people

are wrong to befool they are of the

faction that you were of and they were

kind of like the matriarchs they were

one of the matriarch skelter force teams

you don't know you they were lost within

you know your memory okay when you call

him so what sir wow are you a ll or

those are the company of the silver

scorpion silvus school yeah

I guess the question now is is that

really who these people are or is that

just what they look like are you afraid

of them that way as you remember you've

been eaten I I know of these people yes

I think I'd rather not talk too much

talk about the past right now so OD what

do you know about these guys I mean

that's that means they're coming to kill

you I flick him if it's a terrible idea

I have to tweet about this all right

well he's a break for that a break for

what like tweeting listen I have to it's

in a moment I have to if it's how do I

know it's happening if I'm not tweeting

patrolling you also in this moment while

these things are running up towards us

I'm gonna get down on the battle deck

what is yes soon okay it's a drought

they do city guys it's a shadow it's a

shadow of your mates just really dark in

here actually I've had friends that were

classically when they get him any of

they'll buy two or three versions of it

and I'll have one of them and they

payment like rock so so here's a

petrified version of jeez that is cool

um what are the tentacles of the song

you never are they all so wrapped up in

kind of struggling with like this stuff

our condition actually tentacles are

used to like try and swipe at these no

the tentacles are not the tentacles of

the somnium - neighbors are like its

mouth mandible things so they basically

face in that direction uh-huh and so

they'll just flail around sort of

uselessly okay so you're talking earlier

about how like all of these like seaweed

like it's like grasping around the ship

and Inter like the windows and stuff

like that um how far away right now are

the like ghostly drow also are they like

see-through ghosts or are they just like

silver for some reason they are like

they're not they're not safe they're not

they are not insubstantial they are kind

of glowing they're like with an inner

unholy light

that's why they pay us the big bucks

also you guys all the initiative copy we

did oh I forgot I did now yeah that's

because it's been so long

yeah it's neat that we get to use the

actually yeah I'm pretty sure I know

what's in that box that's sitting on the

counter I think I know too I wonder if I

wonder if we should take a break and

open it and then come back and we'll be

a different prop here it's a little

early to take a break it is but yeah

maybe after this battle unless the

battle zone takes for the rest well this

battle actually the files plug its I

guarantee it's gonna take more than 15

minutes that's 15 minutes so we may take

an early break let's take a break

hey everybody we're about we just roll

initiative but like 12

I know I'm in water okay hey I I have

pre-rolled the enemies initiatives 17 oh

yes so copper what's your name

horrible it's the lowest I've ever

gotten judge eight copper copper those

decks is almost certainly higher than

judges Oh King 21t look at that hey

boots 20 I know what the boos all these

boots is is almost certainly an iron my

shirt oh D I'm sorry

[Music]

it might be me cuz it's my idea do we

need a new one of these it's not

unbelievably I got a twenty as well what

seventeen plus three is 20 20 20 s right

20:29 tights just no yeah I made a mud

run

Laura's made me a bunch of these

which is really nice so I'm gonna guess

that leaches Dex as higher than Kings

but lower than boots so these creatures

these these undead there's four of them

there is a leader dude this is su a

lower right who I know I mean you he's

he's famous no you don't know I'm like

okay right

yeah yeah yeah he was a quick oh boy

just their unnatural yeah they stream

across the water and arrive

one two next to me gift no use next to

me this is not so these guys actually do

look like this by the way all right

these are minis that look like the thing

that they're representing except for the

dude with the hat who unfortunately I

ran out of by the way these on most of

my undead maybe not those guys but most

of these multiple skeletons and zombies

are donated from my friend Jim Murphy

whose minister collection is extensive

and astonished that might be the memory

sir boots was thinking about a guy and a

hat it's not there any ghostbusters so

I'm hoping in late it's not too late to

ask this question to leach but um do you

uh like are these guys like whenever we

figure out like you know these guys like

they always have worked on this island

there is this like a new development

since you last we're with them yeah I

know all of them Sir babe Oh were you

weren't you weren't with them

no no no no no I'd never you'd era a

little grander than I was so I see is

our hair standing on end

so yes you percent you and boots boots

and Kings as soon as these guys get

within about 60 feet you start to feel

that tell-tale like you're just like

somebody just walked over your grave

which by the way the memory eaters

they don't generate on debt they make

they make illusions and the illusions

are just to trap you this fauna is

adjacent to the memory heater but not

not directly a cause of this is like

those like little shrimps and fishies

that hang out in the ocean and one does

one thing that does everything it's like

a symbiotic relationship I am going to

give Anna I'm gonna give you an

inspiration yay

because I never do and I should well

I've got a coin okay use your coin so

you can hang on to that and you get in

this probably is not what inspirations I

was just impressed with Anna's insight

and so yeah you can spend that whenever

you want to get advantage on a roll it

can be any Oracle you've done so that

might post it do you still have

inspiration vacation hang on

inspirations by the way this is our 10th

episode oh wow without me going mad or

crazy or just throwing this table up or

anybody my friends getting so angry I

feel not your inspiration yes maybe

feels just disgusted with this whole

thing is like I don't where is Phil is

he watching hey Phil we miss you don't

holiday somewhere good for him he

deserves a holiday so yeah thanks for

watching we're gonna go now that we've

set up the battle and we have initiative

set up we're going to take a 10 or 15

minute break and gonna go open a box and

maybe a video it if we are coordinated

and then didn't come back and there may

be a new or different prop we'll see who

knows I don't know I literally don't

know what's in the box

it's a box idea so I'm gonna press the

start break button and we're gonna start

break after these messages we'll be

right back we're back thank you for

sticking around and putting up with us

we kind of last-minute switcheroo that

we wanted to do which you'll get to see

in a minute and I think if we have the

tactical cameras set up correctly you

could see the crazy amazing model of the

somnium to never said Alex Pitman aka

craft of the sky eske why he on Etsy

Instagram and Facebook have made for us

one of the the mast broke in shipping

and we weren't able to get it reattached

but that's not a problem if he or

anybody is a anybody who makes mini

or paints minis or assembles them at

Euler and overtime that stuff just

breaks if you use it if you play with it

if you're moving around it's no big deal

just glue back together a touch it up

nobody will be able to tell so we're

gonna get some putty probably and we're

going to glue it together but it is

unbelievable this is so yeah this is

next-level

like it looks super cool yeah I mean

it's it's pretty awesome

it's a beautiful representation of my

ship we recorded we recorded ourselves

opening this so we'll upload that to the

second YouTube channel so that you'll

get to hear us squealing like tiny young

people over in reading out Alex's letter

Alex thank you very much this is it's

the the fact that people are inspired to

create this stuff kind of blows me away

makes me really happy as I say all the

time Dungeons & Dragons is it's almost

like the ideal hobby because whenever

you're into like you're a writer you're

an artist you don't you know I'm not an

artist but I like cartography I like

doing world building I like to knit I

like to whatever hello and I want to

paint minions I want to make train I

want to make things D and E needs that

and you get to express yourself and show

off in ways you might not know there are

always good to do also on our second

channel by the way we just uploaded

today you can go watch is the dragon

assembly a video that we shot quite a

while ago and it's with our friend Dave

who runs a company called trench works

trench works is in Utah and they are

partners making all the dragon minis for

the Kickstarter something like 80,000

different pieces had to be made in order

to create all the dragons that are

currently sitting in warehouses waiting

for the books to arrive so they can all

ship together you can watch us make it's

our first maker video and you can tell

it's our first maker video the next one

will have better audio and everything

else but it was a lot of fun to make

Dave as a super awesome guy you could

actually watch the process and a

complete walkthrough from illustration

all the way through to us we physically

make a dragon in this video so please

check that also if you were listening to

the music and the intro during the

during the thing during the intermission

that was Jerry's your

jerry has his own writer that he yeah

jerry has his own time writer that he is

assembled and he's that was a very first

batch and he was showing off to me and i

was like this is really cool like this

[ __ ] this is this is perfectly

listenable when it comes to generative

kind of you know quasi semi random music

so good job Jerry I hope people got a

kick out of that

and now is there anything else oh oh

that's right hey we get much like this

unbelievable piece of 3d art that we got

we also get other fan art which we are

going to show off right now we are

incredibly lucky and honored to have

people creating stuff for us I'm still

gobsmacked by it George it's really cool

that's cool yeah they're gonna work on

some of the other characters too it's

super exciting that is pretty like the

expression yeah like that's you know I

also like the fact that he's got red

tinted skin but it's not this is I love

this this looks like this looks like a

piece of art from the fiend folio if you

go back and look at which is where they

get the Yankee are from so I think this

is super cool I know Phil loved it he

talked about it on Twitter at the sign

of the Dreaming Pharaoh

that is awesome as far as I'm concerned

that is the sign yeah

that is the sign in front of the

Dreaming Pharaoh the Pharaohs drool

somebody made a character specific

specific sheet and they used to pop a

big cat as the monocle yeah I also yeah

that's great that's super cool my diary

I just take my diary

everywhere yeah that's awesome

love that chronicles changes like hey I

do i do character sketches hang up and

yeah it's super cool looks like a

business card

baby big cat is lollipop she'll be

bagged as well busy capitalist a baby

big that's like a plush yeah like that

is a great piece of art look at that man

that's so cool I think we saw couples

swim outfit is slim yeah we sure have we

seen this before this is amazing this is

like legit like I would expect to see

this like in a real RPG that I bought

yeah that's who shoes I was like I want

to put this on this for the first time

live on this stream somebody created

that art based on based on leech manager

iskills character and I'm like we gotta

put that in the extended extended break

but now you got to see why thank you

very much thank you very much for all of

it's a blast it's a lot of fun thank you

for thank you for spending your time

with us and thanks for being creative

and just making awesome stuff

it's super cool to see people it's one

things I think we all love about this

hobby so now you guys are all gonna die

okay I think we have to move the real

song name to numerous so that we can use

the tactical somnium to neveress okay to

actually play with can somebody nobody

wants to touch it it was great it's

really light it's not it's like I'm just

shifted over here put it on the shelves

I think I think like my I think the

coolest part of this is that the teeth

he explains in the letter that he

basically just made this out of like he

completely scratched built this out of

just raw materials yeah it's like a

bunch of yeah cat 5 cat 5 cables and

speaker wires like liner notes crotch

that's amazing yeah it's really cool

okay so it is

like this though let me write down so

you guys them I just want to make sure

that I think we said it's a give me but

I have I did cast armor shadows on

myself and a beginning to this day well

is I I did not know you did that but

yeah if I can cause a jammer on myself

at will without spell slots or material

comp last eight hours but it seems

perfectly reasonable that you would do

that yeah you know as the day begins I

think going on an adventure here I'm

gonna get my off it's like you're

putting your armor on no more shadows

they do that with my blood pop armor

beginning a day you have to put that

right no they're just always on but i

but i get temporary hit points uh let's

see undead wanker no yes

Walker undid Walker Walker wanker I'm

over here on my side it says what they

are but you guys don't know what they

are yeah I'm happy I'm very pleased to

have you at the table mr. Driscoll and

what that is one of the reasons I'm

delighted is because when we were

talking about making your character like

Matt has watched every episode he

watches all be he watches all the change

stuff and so it was it was it was easy

to communicate with him about the nature

of the show and what we were doing so

let's see where is the commander

standing next to judge I can't see a

thing for me this is a corporeal

creature

you know I stand right it's made of it's

got substance it's just has this unholy

glow about it

uh-huh yeah and it's gonna try to hit

you and it does AC 24 mm-hmm

and it does six points in damage boots

its wings it's wearing a chain shield

and cert and shield and it has a black

metal longsword that it uses all right

what is what is what is the guy with the

hat what does he does he look the same

as the other guys

there's only two different kinds of guys

there's the boss you can kind of see him

and the other ones are all the same all

right uh I will I will attack the hats

Minh okay so let's yeah I don't know

where's on that cuz I'm on the other

side of them yeah actually we have

another we have another ship that we

could you'd like her to use if I got my

ship Marty other that actually does have

a grid on it and those who have

advantaged do I'm an advantage on the

Hat guy no because I think it's like

yeah I yeah if their work red it would

be licensed okay so if he were here you

would okay

and so this guy we're trying to impose a

grid and gets like maybe like a thirty

[Music]

[Music]

so you're getting hat guy he is undead

wanker number three just remember that

guy does a there's a fourteen hit no all

right does no they're wearing chain and

shield does it a natural twenty hit yes

a natural twenty always it's wonderful

all right does that double all of my

weapon damage address like you always

roll all dice twice roll all dice dice

you don't you don't double the numbers

so if you have a DA plus three-year-old

e8 but only still in plus three not

blessing but for a for like including

like Sweden yep including all that stuff

you roll all your dice twice I meet some

less unless it says no you know should

have brought a finger dice

what do you mean by more sixes please

[Music]

three 20 minutes

holy crap yeah well do you want to know

do me too roll and we'll talk about 700

mm I smell a nerf coming all right why

did I don't think that let's sneak it

there that's normal yeah double double

the sneak attack guys all right good

lord or I will pretty well too yeah

sorry sorry for this sorry for all this

damage that I did hoping nobody except

Matt yeah

46 damage okay is that a magic weapon

that is a mundane weapon well

unfortunately it does definitely do

quite a lot of damage but you sense that

some of the chunks of flesh that are

being ripped off because this thing is

dead aren't actually slowing it down so

only some percentage of the damage

you're doing is being a factor you said

46 damage

46 that would be God and also go ahead

and make a strength save gap with a DC

20 what is this what are you just trying

to miles but he failed so I even though

they're incredibly strong credibly badly

incredibly smacked by he's go back up

pieces stay down

good god man ridiculous

it's the haunted it's the haunted the

industry that would be amazing something

that was that was booths correct I'm

sorry it's leech leech oh I can't really

see where am i you are right here is

there any meetings a bad guy right there

next three you can't see actually why

don't we move the boat into the middle

of the thang okay so because right now

it's quite convenient to where I'm

sitting right it's very very not

convenient to at least three other

people there so it's kind of as much

toward the middle as we can and that way

hodie can see it alright and then my imp

is to my right I see yes do I look at

these guys

did I have any ranged weapons really

have ring yeah they have their bows okay

everyone rolls let's go quite range on

there right it does it's yeah long bows

have quite a range yeah so if you were

to cast a spell that allowed you to I

don't think it's any point moving out of

the way then I'm just gonna attack this

guy I'm here with you do ah I'm gonna

target attack this guy there's next to

me okay who is that one is he just said

he's not little he's just about the boss

okay wanker number one and I'm gonna

attack him with my agonizing blast so

it's like I get to watch it with two

different people or whimpers I'm gonna

shoot him by for that person so let's go

for the first one first 15 plus 6 is 21

or you definitely it and damage on that

one was 5 plus another 3 8 yeah this

definitely does you notice it like

unlike boots

who's slicing and cutting chunks of

flesh and a lot of that doesn't do any

thing your bolt of divine energy you see

this blast of glowing golden almost like

almost like like golden napalm comes

like spewing out of your fingertip yeah

it's like that

I'd like miss and there's a arc of it

that stretches well it doesn't have to

go very far

no and it splashes against this creature

and starts eating away that like acid

and it appears to be fully effective

that was your first one first dose I'm

in it for another one aim 11 plus 6 seas

17 now 11 plus 6 is 17 that hits and

right around a that is on food near one

so for you guys can see that the minions

of the not minions are AC 16 for damage

yeah got it

that was leech it's king so I'm gonna go

ahead and cast turn Undead

and this guy should be within 30 feet

too so the boss and these two guys make

a DC DC 15 wisdom safe or their turn for

one minute so which ones are doing it

these two in that guy these guys let's

wanker two and three and the SpikerBox

wanker

boss wanker makes it wanker number two

that was the DC 15 number wanker number

two does not make it wanker number three

makes it with bigger they seem as though

I wake or number three is hat wanker by

the way yeah the they soon disadvantage

when they're done they seem as though

the energy of your of your Hegar and God

seem maybe it's weaker because you're

not in the right dimension or maybe

these things are just possessed of an

unholy might but they they don't seem to

be as as affected by your attempt to

compel them to turn

as you'd expect okay hmm well wanker

Tina's got a runaway copper and Big

Daddy okay okay I'll Tech okay

yeah with my normal bow and arrow

we should have enchanted our things you

gotta want to push our weapons I don't

think we were prepared though yeah we

didn't know I didn't know but only it

only lasts for an hour so gonna be a

little tactical with it but sure 22 hits

or we're definitely have 8 damage this

is the top deck Waker yeah mm-hmm it's

definitely we're definitely gonna get a

youtube comment I don't think this

happens live in the twitch cream 100%

we're gonna get a youtube comment from

somebody going it's so unprofessional

why does he calls undead wankers that's

ridiculous this totally it breaks my

immersion you should be serious your

wankers they're attacking us yeah twenty

seven or nine damage they see 27 yeah

this is a second second second my hit

second hit for nine damage yeah and then

oh wait these are regular everyday

heroes correct yeah there's no other I'm

the big cat as a reaction closer to that

guy God and then I'll attack what they

can I got what displacer beast

approaches the oh I forgot the plus was

um alive - okay you do miss correct

cotton big cat gives it its best shot

but these things are very heavily

armoured and they are agile combatants

and they're able to use their sword and

shield to defend themselves against

coppers ten tackles actually Oh use my

bonus action okay I use keen eye yeah on

the boss got it so go ahead make a roll

see if you can see if you can figure out

how he fights

Oh Plus wisdom um shoot it's 8 plus or

die roll plus you're stabbed on sorry

well I'm not blanking right now wait

were you looking at Oh a okay right

sorry you're just you're just rolling a

d20 and you're adding your your wisdom

modifier and I think your proficiency

modifier got it yeah

Oh five it's way off yeah probably it

would have to be like a CR 1 or 2 or 3

creature 5 plus your is wish your wisdom

just 1 plus 1 5 6 and your portion 6 7 8

9 so yeah it would have to be like a CR

would be like a regular work or

something so we probably should like we

that like that's something that should

work like one sperm out so if you're

having two if you havin to roll it the

fact you have to roll means you can fail

yeah and that's gonna be kind of

frustrating so we should prioritize it

to make it more straightforward no

surprise is that the end of copper bones

are ya I'm deaf

no don't apologize judge hmm

I think that's all the rope we haven't

commented in a while I was like why are

all the enemies within 30 feet of judge

I would say charge in there so that's

it's late let's say I'm using is like so

let's imagine judges there'll be 5 10

this ones yes

5 10 15 20 wait judges their 5 10 15 20

25 yet

so now that I'm level 6 I can use 3rd

level spells and like one of the third

level worker spells so I've never used

this before so we're gonna discover -

you asked for some clear if you put them

on blast judge so I am i can use

interdict it's hairy toss a tear test

and I can place the seal on every enemy

within 30 feet and this does not use any

of your seals does that mean there's

need any of my spells huts so your seals

don't you

oh you are yes cool and that's fine for

now you're gonna be a little bit you're

gonna be probably a little bit

overpowered just for tonight but because

I also want to change if we're if we're

making it so the ill rigors placing a

seal you still only have a number of

seals equal to your charisma but if

we're gonna do if we're gonna make it so

that they don't require to burn a spell

slot then the number of spells you get

per day is gonna go down so you could

become more like a warlock okay because

you don't need that many you spell slots

anymore because you're not having to I

just wanna make it so the illa rigger

didn't have to choose do I want to cast

a spell to put on a seal no you should

be putting seals on but this because

it's a spell the resources the resource

it's burning is your spell slot okay

it's not burning your seals cool all

right so yeah that's the idea

we'll see what happens okay so yeah I'm

gonna use up in my third level spell

slots and basically a third level spells

should definitely it definitely that's

it shouldn't eat up your seals because

that's a lot of it's a very valuable

resource for you right now cool yeah I'm

gonna go ahead and cast that that means

that like basically like it just washes

over from with that from within all the

enemies now have a seal on their

forehead the only judge can see that's a

bonus section so I'm gonna go ahead and

take a couple swings so they've now been

dammed by Asmodeus unease how does that

help well it's it's it's basically a

[ __ ] way of cursing somebody uh-huh

and there are a lot of things a cursed

creature has to deal with depends on

what judge chooses to do yeah there's

like some basic stuff and there's also

some additional spells that I can use

that will then impact like all of those

with seals on it and I got it right now

everybody doesn't sleep yeah so I'm

gonna go ahead and attack the captain

who's next to me with my great sword so

great sword does are using it doesn't

matter what the great sword that has the

adamantium blade that's also like a 2d6

hmm it is in all other ways a regular

great sword it's just made of adamantium

could be magical if you use your wand

ah does a nineteen hit yes once the

players hit I usually try to put their

they don't know how because they can see

what armor they're wearing a you know

anybody can look at somebody and see

what armor they're wearing another give

you a vague idea of whether or not

they're gonna be hard to hit or easy to

hit you can sort of tell when creatures

are nimble or whatever but you don't

actually know that number until you hit

at which point I'm not gonna make your

guess cuz you could just the players

could sit there and they could keep

track we hit we hit with a 19-foot we

missed with a 17 I mean it's either 18

or 19 I don't want to make them do that

so once they hit mm-hmm that way they

can look here and they don't have to ask

me and we can maybe speed things up I do

a total of 24 damage I hit him on the

second attack as well this is the boss

and you did 24 damage mm-hmm got it

thank you for rolling even numbers of

damage so I can round up if I yeah yeah

yeah you definitely like this uh this

greatsword feels it's a very nicely

weighted it's very expensively made it's

I would say comparable to your regular

greatsword Slim's you have a probably

new slim is great some memory stores

weighted differently but once again you

feel as though much like much like boots

you take a huge chunk out of one of

these things that doesn't seem to slow

down as much as you'd expect nothing in

my turn that's judge it's the bad guys

so uh the one who is up and next to

boots will attack boots so it won't he

roll it was right he will he's

frightened correct yep is he is not

feared he has this event is he just

frightened I'll read the whole thing to

you i I don't know

as an action all in debt within 30 feet

they can see and hear me must make a

wisdom save if the undead feels the save

it has turned for one minute or until it

takes any damage turned move away and

never within 30 feet of me no reactions

no actions other than - yeah that's

better than fear yeah yeah because only

works on that then I'm sure it makes

sense yeah yeah so he will turn he will

go and I doubt they're lower than half

see our sailor he evaporated but no man

there used to be a whole turn on dead

table and each different type of undead

had a different like yeah that's so

that's where that like I destroy

creatures below this level of the table

anyway well as I global up I think he

gets higher CR again yeah well he will

run to the prow of the boat he's crying

remember these guys on the banks that

gooey wanker that's just what they hear

when I use turn on dead command wanker

and yeah power wanker sorry security in

Egypt all right no that's that guy the

other did will stand up no hey we he

will attack boots you're the one an octa

- but right oh yeah yeah so the drow is

also this these drow are also using what

they look like rape years I'm sorry sir

did my dancing offend you

it it howls that you would under common

do you speak under coming

no okay thank God I don't have to figure

out what he said AC 18 hits

and he actually responds with with fury

you your taunt angers him and so he

attacks right now he kind of starts

behaving recklessly so I can take that

as a compliment you can he starts

behaving recklessly

and he attacks you again a c16 does not

hit okay so he it looks as though it's

like especially copper would be able to

tell it looks as though this guy is

probably he's so angry that he's not

defending himself the way he normally

would so concentrating on attacking so

attack attack in between now and the

start of his next turn you're gonna get

advantage on six poison him and then the

sword Wraith that's fighting the oh yeah

he really doesn't he really doesn't like

you may yes I'm in thinking would a sees

90 what am i again I'm 16 so yes doesn't

it oh okay the boss prepares to attack

judge that true does not hit but an

18-wheel it I have not been calling I

feel bad for MCD I'm stats I have not

been calling on my die rolls but the 18

definitely hits for not a lot for these

things not to a limit seven points of

damage and he holds up his sword and

calls out to his matriarch bleep archers

appear there

I'm gonna use my reaction against him

the cash hell rebuke it sounds good at

third level can have these ghostly growl

armed with long

here on the captain's deck or the

quarterdeck what's called so have a go

ahead make a deck save AC is 16 DC 16

plus 2 is insufficient okay so he's

gonna take 13 plus for everything he's

gonna take 17 points of damage from the

hell is rebuked that's quite a lot

mm-hmm

no I follow them no he who just the boss

sorry yeah yeah he is hellishly rebuked

his rebuke in a quite infernal manner

company like this that is I guess who

was that

that's like her I know the boss the boss

the bad guy then I get my all go right

after each other and now it's boots all

right so I have sorry these three guys

when they show up they get to shoot okay

I know I apologize and they are gonna

fire down at boots and King there's

three of them right one at boot is 10

plus 3 is know it and then two at 17

plus three is a hit four plus three is

amiss so you take Newark nine poison

damage from an arrow a ghost bleed a

closely an undead a glowing undead arrow

flies across the bridge of the somnium

neveress and strikes through the back

the deck of the bridge I had to

needlessly kill all these arrows undead

arrow we had to go find my chair I was

killed him and then you sir ghosts that

was them now it's boots all right I saw

advantage on this guy until his next

turn correct until the start of his

Esther well I'll take advantage of that

he's just so furious at the manner in

which you taunted him and the fact that

you're alive and he's not I'm gonna do

this like flourishing little sword move

you mad bro hey furious what

all right this is acts 17 plus eight oh

yeah all right everybody cast hello

should be forgets them does it look like

that also is not as effective as it

appears to be completely expected undead

or powerful undead are often resistant

to normal weapons 22 damage an even

number to that guy uh and I will check

him again my offhand and Miss probably

actually you know that's still 17 yeah

yeah okay let's be yep

[Music]

and is there any chance that I can move

basically between the boss and the

railing there yeah

wait we mean like right here oh no I

mean between uh I'm sorry I thought you

meant between like judge Oh like so

you're on the other side you get up if

you get up behind on the boots I'll

shift so that way we can I mean there's

no room between the boss and the railing

right

there's room yeah these guys saw a

poking out archers in the way so I

assume you're moving in such a way that

does not provoke a tax of opportunity

correct and 5-10-15 you have to move

through Judge basic if to around him you

know five ten fifteen twenty

yeah no problem who is that it oh that's

it for me leach you're being attacked by

an enemy drow uh so I hate my cutlets

you put an arrow or two in him right

it's half the big cat in Du Monde

ethanol how does he look

probably still healthy you know he's

he's seen better days he's falling apart

there are parts of his body or there

holes in em and he's fueled Melissa bang

anger he seems okay he's just as angry

as ever so he's just as effective I

think I'm gonna give him a bit more the

old agonizing blasts I mean that's

that's it's hugely effective because

it's a yep it's not a heat it sort of

thing go one comes out 18 hits and then

eight plus what I get on that three

eight nine ten eleven on that one and

then my second finger 17 hits ignites

another 11 to 11

yeah it's uh it's it's mostly now just

like spine and like almost a lot of its

flesh has been rented away and it's just

hanging on like again it's it's it's

it's the thing keeping it alive right

now is mostly it's it's burning eternal

hatred for you oh great that he's now

been this two more times

leach calls upon his patron and summons

this celestial holy power it erupts from

his finger splashes all over the undead

and everywhere everywhere this this holy

napalm touches there's almost nothing

left tattered rags pieces of armor and

this thing is like now mostly

see-through but still alive or still

active okay uh how's the guy in front of

the Hat dude yeah yeah hat dude is also

not happy okay and when he rages does he

get disadvantaged on saves how would you

know that he acted recklessly right that

was what you're talking just seemed like

he got really angry at whatever was

boots said to him and as a result he

behaved he kind of dropped his guard and

stopped worrying about his about

defending himself just to get

to attack and anything more than that

you're gonna have to deduce using your

head meets alright well go ahead and

make a DC 15 Dec save angry boy for

sacred flame sacred 15 plus 1 is more

than 15 yep alright well thank you

radiant life flies by his face he turns

his anger toward you that was King is

copper and big cat okay yep I'll shoot

this guy Dini shame off oh let's see 24

hits yeah oh I'll have enameled 11

damage from a regular arrow make it go

up the toilet if you like mm-hmm make it

even well yeah

tell you that you wanker

what's that let's bomb under styling on

you yeah I got a what is styling on you

mean who's that owing him up showing

what yeah that's some broad tool so that

was my first hit yeah all tech mmm-hmm

that Bowman man emoji

oh yeah it's a common freezing in Agoura

yep oh yeah 15 no no sorry 25 25 hits or

seven damage to Bowman

arrow wanker is on fire man wing is it

two of them up there 33 out three up on

the top date with us okay okay so let's

call that one you just hit number one

I'm sorry you do how much damage the

first one I bought 1111 bow or a min got

it

I hope sorry boys I was off by one or so

mean and then

woman I assume I miss correct okay I'm

done

that was copper and big cat it's judge

okay so I'm gonna go ahead and use a

bonus action to put one of my seals on

the captain in front of me okay so the

captain now has two seals yes and that

was a real seal that was a burning of

the [ __ ] of your charisma yes

that's minus one do yours are you still

unfavored by Asmodeus or is that

something reread find uh I think I'm

still unfavored okay so yeah ya know

when someone asks you a fear of God you

say yeah well I volunteered I have huge

respect as I've Ahlan teared to retcon

what happened because I thought it would

be unfair to punish judge for her hands

mistake and Anna said no I want to play

we're allies like if that's what

happened that's what happened and I was

like well cause I think I think judge

would have probably let us Lynn do this

thing anyway either way the same and

then I'm gonna go ahead and attack this

guy really before you do that yeah I'm

gonna shift as I as boots sees judge

with the great sword yeah yeah shift all

right so yeah now he's gonna swing and

I'm with advantage advantage there's a

15 hit the second attack actually yeah

so two plus six is thirteen okay so he

does thirteen physical damage with the

great sword got it and then I'm gonna go

ahead and consume one of the seals and

so I get to do an additional two d6

necrotic damage oh really yeah okay okay

I think that's right yeah yeah you know

I'm pretty sure it is okay so I do an

additional eight damage that way and

because I'm within 30 feet after

consuming to steal I get to heal one

yeah so it's one of the things that

shines ooh and she can review hit them

so you if you hit someone has one of

judges seals on them judge can consume

the seal down and quick question is that

a reaction that I have to use to do that

because I was gonna do it earlier but

then I already use the reaction though I

don't think it's a reaction I think it's

just to do it okay I'm not sure what the

actual language for that would be okay

but I have seen language where it's just

you guys do this okay okay and that's

the end of my turn so not all but some

undead powerful undead aren't because

they're there because they're Undead

they're often immune or have some kind

of damage resistance to the chronic did

you look healthier after I used it no no

they don't have they're probably are

faster is that it seems like the or

earlier editions undead were weirder and

cooler and sometimes would do stuff like

that

mm-hmm but these guys are just resistant

to your that's all okay

that was judge its oh these bad guys so

let's see so scared wanker is gonna

still be scared he is never gonna say it

right it's just for now so I have have a

hat wanker walk up to King it's still

crying at the names we call them yeah

you must understand common then you can

actually buy a very strange quirk of

linguistic improbability wanker is the

same

yeah turns out everyone knows you do

wanker

so yeah this guy is gonna walk up and

he's going to also because of the anger

he feels at what you did to his friend

he is gonna make two attacks against you

which I advise king 20mm like that you

know they bullets he attacks you twice

and he went he is also doing his

reckless endangerment thing that's that

dude the 3 archers three archers are all

gonna I think they're all gonna attack

him

because these guys are tactically pretty

advanced and they were aware that this

is by ganging up it's probably all we're

gonna arcing Oh King is the source of so

14 plus 6 is 20 19 plus 6 to hit 9

doesn't 14 19 and as 2 hits and I

believe it's just Judi eight seven seven

point that image two ends and there is

that guy is dead yeah we kill one so now

it's the it's the commander who's

something if there's dead the dude who

was up here coded make sure he's move

but you're a drop if you got so now that

this guy is now that this guy's angry he

is also going to attack with reckless

abandon the boss Oh II don't want to

yield boy

yeah well and even though judge is the

more heavily armored he will focus on

judge or chartres class treasurer it is

16 I'm not that actually it's a more

heavily art man that I am

really what are you wearing farmer I

don't know you look more heavily armored

hey

yeah and that's probably true you're

correct

yes I'm wearing like I don't know a half

later so my fancy boots fancy boots mr.

fancy books let's got to sleep with my

fancy oh wow no I rolled a 10 11 and 2

13s I believe all for those because he

is plus them there's no way that you

guys know that except I want MC diem

stats to be able to track with my die

rolls I wanna make their lives easier

because they work hard transcribing all

those nonsense that we do Wow

so once again you guys have you guys are

gonna have advantage on attacks against

these guys against him I should say do I

have enough well I know weapon is this

guy using a lot of sort it looks like a

regular it's a big rig here great great

beer get creepy it's covered in grapes

[Music]

43 points of damage

what whoa it's your four times three

times I put 10 11 and 12 times 10 11 to

13

Oh to 13 how much did you save 11 what

was the total those were the rules and

then plus uh I can do it again 43 points

damage

are you down yeah this thing is uh

there's a reason there's a reason this

guy was the commander of this elite

drought company wow this is the what was

he's facing sort of our that's it I'll

never go that right thanks well she's

areas we're gonna all get captured no

matter how this plays out uh so that

would be very bad don't you're mastering

my part

these guys do very little damages at

that one time cuz you made him angry

just to make him angry and everything'll

be fine and now you guys the flip side

of that is he is is attacking without

heed to his own defense

means you now he'll already have

advantage because you're flanking him

but boots all right just watch this guy

Cuisinart judge edge was completely

unable to defend himself against this

guy's relentless onslaught someone

unusual turn of events boots is not

happy about having seen that idiots is

that that's more like by the way that's

only about as much as boots did when

boots attacked 17 damage and view back

[Music]

one more damage and damage please else

make a spring sitting throw okay against

a 1600 k DC 16 hour 13 13 plus 4 is 70

very well fine then eco secrets sweet

[Music]

there were four there are three arches

with their backs toward you is judge

within you can't even see judge 60 feet

Mina oh yeah you did your spell did you

spell require you to have l OS all

spells that's not true

I'm pretty sure most spells require line

aside and line of effect and although

and I know we're doesn't play as hammock

but I mean I think there are some spells

that you could rule that do Harry all

around corners and stuff you'll be right

next to this guy but not only that not

only do they have you have to have line

of sight and line of effect I believe a

lot of spells say that certain effects

are like that - bill - see where that

Billy earlier depending on what it is

you're doing I don't imagine no I heard

heard judge cry out after that last

attack I mean II - a lot of damage well

judge is that anything is becoming is

taking a brutal a brutal amount of

damage in one attack the kind of thing

that would cause the judge to exclaim or

call out or or grunt or there's nothing

like a ton of damage for him to take so

while he normally would you know take

her on the chin kind of thing I think

this amount of damage you definitely

would have heard I think because that's

like for tax right you definitely have

at least heard like yeah I guess like

the armor and stuff like that so I hear

noise it on that so noise I never heard

judge make before great concerns me

mm-hmm his doctor it's too bad that OD

indeed didn't turn out better but mostly

audio quality was super not great

because I think you're a natural obvious

I kiss your [ __ ] like this is only like

we played like when you play Dee Dee we

only played like four recessions before

I think yeah yeah I love how you just

interpreted we were like what she was

saying and then said yeah alright so I

hear the cries dive I realize it's Judge

it's not a sound I've heard him make

before so I worry and I want to go and

see true thanks I move to a point where

I can see there's Jessica Lee like I

don't know

okay so I don't think I want to be even

between the arches though I'll wait to

the side of them yeah so I could see any

c4 drow for truck you know yeah movement

and so I see judge I realize he's in

some amount of distress judges booyah

and so I am going to use if I can find

it on this sheet just so I get its right

healing light as a bonus action

I can hear a creature I can see within

60 feet by expending dice I can expand

up to my Christmas modifier of diced

wheat I was 3 right 3 because that's

your money from up or any time the

target Hills hit points equal to the

role of these dice but I think what sick

and once I use this I expend it and I

need a long rest to get them back okay

yeah I meditate obviously yeah sleeps

for hours I think I'll give you the

three you're looking a bad way to me I'm

concerned for you I'm concerned for your

health doctor so I leave you three

healing lights come on there's a safe

yeah well we get there 11 plus 3 is 15

nice I thought I'd give food scene hell

proper clear and pretty good I move that

this would you say get [ __ ]

no you say wanker no something much much

worse by possibilities how many there's

three arches up there right yes this

one's a little bit damaged sorry we just

start taking it out okay now like

hopefully those two can deal with the

big guy

yes so the archer is closest to me yeah

he's pretty close yeah finger art he

said we're gonna do he's gonna get an

agonizing blah

this is pretty agonised 11 plus 6 is 17

bits and then 4 5 6 7 7 damage first

well this one of these poor guys has

taken damage yeah this one

so you did bad a hit with my second got

agonizing blast and that's all dear 4/10

okay very nice so you see like you see

leech literally put his finger next to

this things happy it's it's it's dead it

looks like a drow but it's dead so it's

not really paying attention the way it

would be if it were alive and he fires

this bolt of golden liquid energy that

just eradicate this things all this

stuff is a skull a drow sculptor was one

skin and hair and but they had these

little these little almost like tiaras

with a symbol of a silver scorpion on

them and now there's just the skull and

the metal silver of the scorpion emblem

that's cool

sweet that was legions king yeah I'm

done so I'm gonna try to shift behind

you master

I'm voting you up that was a definite

not know what's going to his head

thank you cover from the archers and go

ahead and make a DC 15 DEXA save for

sacred flame sacred I will the 20

all right well with us by again I don't

like that I don't get the rollin attack

what's sacred flame kind of sucks yeah I

get that

don't leave it out of their other can

trips that clerics don't get other tech

games I don't think I can go back and

look but yeah it's kind of a bummer

doesn't have to image or anything so

just like boy what copper sorry sorry

sorry

thank god these around here otherwise

yeah yeah I looked at that and I was

like I'll attack the omen the one will

be damage yep number 20 I roll my second

time this is cool hime and 8 damage well

right overall my second attack oh my

gosh 11 I missed I rolled the one listen

even the best Rangers it was the Sun was

in my eye the Sun in the Sun it was the

bright it was the bright light from his

his Eldrick blast yeah how's it

do you don't get a big cat goes well

yeah that's this turn oh that was just

guys no no no sorry it's his turn oh

sorry

oh yeah you switching top 20 yay woo oh

so we get the role this is um man this

is a 1 we didn't attack yet sure that's

number 3 6 1 it's 1 2 3 10 15 15 damage

1919 damage man maintain image build a

normal arrow correct no normal tentacle

normal normal unmanageable technical

yeah yeah it's not doing full damage

correct bass do not half was hitting cuz

it's not I mean whenever you hear me say

it seems like it's not do it like this

half damage there's no other there's no

other gradient it either doesn't full

damage it does half damage or it does no

damage alright there's no real reason

for me to be Chloe like that and be like

ah it doesn't seem like except I like

narrating it a little bit got it

so copper is done yep judge alright so

judge feels a little better after

getting like a little pick me up from

Leach and so there's like well no nod

and then turns back over well tempered a

cat yeah well you know you gotta be nice

to your talk of all the people who each

was a cool name too he went over at

lunch he went on and looked up like

Victorian slang for adopts and went

through a whole bunch of everyone's is

likely stuck pretty quickly

Oh

that story has character too so I'm

gonna go ahead and uh did you want a

back story he was really excited I'm

gonna grab this guy basically I'm gonna

put hands on him like you know trailing

just grabbed by the cooler basically

because judge is pissed and so he's

gonna try and do I'm just trying to

decide who's he's trying to gonna try

and open an internal conduit between

himself and Grayson

yeah which is the first time he's ever

done this this is funny because I was

thinking about buffing in general [ __ ]

oh you wanna do it right now no thinking

it was cuz he never use it and I was

like I need to make this I was what I

was gonna do is make a sort of for you

yeah sure I think it was an action and

it's harped me to decide if I'm gonna

give up an action well that's not you is

that like infernal conduit is but is

different than lay on hands because lay

on hands is just I heal so that's less

of an issue do I do I heal or do i

attack well obviously if something's

about to die heal up you can also use

that offensively so it yeah if you can

use that offensively the offensive

version needs to be able to compete with

your normal attack at least in some way

mm-hmm otherwise you're never going to

do yeah

so that's what I was think about

tweaking anyway can do so I think he

needs to make a constitution save

against a DC 16 oh well

that's his best how does quick question

in your game how does inspiration work

you spend it and get advantage on thank

okay so I can't spend it to cause

somebody to like reroll something no no

not is no I mean Whitten no no no I mean

not as far as I know inspiration does

not allow you to impose disadvantage no

I don't know I don't know I feel like

there was some fourth edition stuff that

does but often at my hand with anything

in fifth edition there's nothing

stopping me like inspiration is a kind

of narrative thing there's nothing

stopping us from rolling no no no for

now I will rule it normal but I mean I

give out an inspiration pretty [ __ ]

infrequently so maybe it should be

possible for you to impose disadvantage

on because it just depends on if you

want to use it before they rolled and

you know the result or after you've seen

it definitely has to be before okay

right because you have to make the call

like this is important I wanted to fail

okay the only thing I was worried about

is like you could have with some really

powerful spell and if you have it if you

have a van

you could use it to make it way more

likely and that kind of but then I

thought I awarded so infrequently that

seems like a perfectly reasonable use of

it so yeah go ahead and if you want to

burn it now but you have to burn it

before okay yeah good because these guys

are in humanly healthy really oh my god

you old one no it's the other it's the

oh my god I'm sorry

I rolled an 18 in a 20 so easy

this guy's sucks I'm sorry but that's I

mean look these are elite drow soldiers

now now made fiercer by despair what can

I do was a bonus action um see you on

somebody yeah yeah I think I'm gonna put

one more scale on them sorry it's got

three seals no judge already consumed

the seals on them I like it I consumed

one seal oh you consumed once you want

him yes actually if I had to you put one

on with the spell you put another one on

just normally yeah and I thought you

consumed only consumed one okay so now

he's got to that's judge it's now the

bad guys the one on King attacks King

that's hotline granite yeah yes hat

wanker attacks King he's going he is did

he is still using his martial theory uh

he rolled on 11 into 2 + 11 + 6 is AC 79

essence division there are 3 archers 2

of them are going to attack George

[Music]

and they will fire two arrows judge each

Gorge armor class sixteen so four shots

from two guys one hit Josh takes 12

points of damage

the third Archer switches to his longbow

safety and attacks leech and says is

that the third one that you're using

right now is that the one right next to

him yeah did it you disadvantaged

because he's right next to him

I can't arrange it is using ranged

weapon within five feet he's using his

own sword a long sword drops he drops

his long oh yeah

he drops his long bone switches to his

long term look out for him I rolled a 5

& a 9 so the 9 might hit 9 plus 6 is AC

15 I've got something oh you have 16

your warlock of an AC 60 my age you

disgust me

you're a mage we'll sit the mage what's

I forgot about the mage what's it yeah

what's it say I think I made what's it

is the best of the what suits the armor

shadows even knows what's called yeah Oh

shadow armor yes you shouldn't know

better and now the boss of all bosses is

going to attack and gosh he does not

like the fact the judge is still alive

but he's gonna he's gonna split his

attention if that hack judge twice he's

gonna attack boots twice included the

greatest swordsman he goes judge its it

twice

1,950 in the u.s. +7 so you take 18

points of damage

judged

hey surgeon yeah that's what I'm

thinking about this drops yeah you can

make it I'm kind of yeah like no I think

I get free movement right yeah you're 13

I'll give ya you can so as a yeah as

I've reaction can you jump down the

railing yeah absolutely can yeah I could

pop down the stairs well there's two

guys right next what else jumps in fine

well chop okay as so I look down and see

judge fall to the ground and immediately

leap over the railing we can acrobatics

check ah acrobatics will get a plus oh

that would be for cuz I rolled a 1 ok

make an athletics track and thank you

athletics I get plus 2 come on now no

more those ones business 50 ok so you

you leap over the railing but you're

booted foot catches on the ralien yah

and those are you watching see him

tumble off out of control and then using

his athletic prowess turns it into a

flip and lands on speed I guess put me

behind charge I guess do you have enough

movement together oh yeah and I get

there and I guess that's that's it right

just opened it now sorry so I get to

hear him and if if you end your movement

adjacent to them which I've done they

mace they may spend a hit that it's been

a good day yeah yeah

my high boots twice I rolled a 6 and an

8 plus 7 is 15 every youth thing that

misses yeah should be honest Paige if

you attack me I did I talked you towards

this once you miss twice as a reaction I

I shall retort a devastating retort that

is a so what does that mean easy an inch

cut not an actual 20 that you achieved a

29 finish what is this thing you just

did to my my beautiful one dead boss

drown wait did you hit you hit

successfully it was an attack because he

missed me like a clumsy fool mm-hmm but

what is what is this ability to let you

do that it's it's called ripoffs so as

you as you lunge at me with this rapier

like a long sword

because it is so huge and unwieldy yeah

I can very easily just bad it away with

with my offhand and use my left hand to

skewer you in the face just a tiny bit

don't pull he's so much seals on them so

we can't consume those two seals now

consume one or two

Josh consumes the seals on the 60s an

additional 14 damage on attack yeah

well keep in mind that's no chronic

damage yeah so both instances your

damages happen unfortunately still

effective just take an axe move okay

okay

yeah he's still very very effective and

healthy but that was all four of his

attacks and the his archers went and hit

the soldiers went the order of the

silver skeleton may be about to meet

their end skeleton scorpion let's go

you're over order the silver would this

happen if it wasn't my turn

oh it says on a turn that's once put bow

so I can't do this again says the first

time first time four turns on ate her

yeah

goose was on his turn so this is the

first time on his turn you hit with a

light or finesse melee weapon and you

aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or

carrying a shield other than the buckler

and no one controls you or no one

controls the siege Tabor so the Fremen

went that's all right

that's just that was the most obscure

joke anyone on Twitch has ever made hey

something lost me yeah so fremming win

and this guy takes one point five points

of Benny Jesuit mind damaged got it got

it because he is the Switchblade

haagen-dazs that was the boss guy it's

now [ __ ] boots advantage on this guy

yeah well you managed on him even if

because he's babies he's so angry but

he's fighting recklessly okay so you

would have advantage even if you were

not blanking but you are finding so you

get to manage in both instances made

this reckless thing ain't working out so

well for you man

it's a huge [ __ ] smoke judge by hell

you should calm down and ease up again

yeah only because of the traitor drow

only because of the heretic 17 but that

misses the boss doesn't it correct

alright clauses 88 mister let me tell

you I do not miss my third edition where

if you missed my one you could literally

just sit there and think hard and come

up with another bonus but 23 this game

would be twice as long you would just

sit there going oh wait so far did this

thing for me and I get this money I

guess

yes I was doing earlier because I was

like okay mister I was like is there

anything I can do because I I always

think guys like Pathfinder days we even

fighting [ __ ] some 5th edition is way

better in that sense you don't have to

say god I got so frustrated with that

anyway uh take 18 damage please what

noise and noise yourself answer me these

questions three okay this says make a

make a strength save against my attacker

was then who's my plus two hit yeah okay

man it's fing safe okay

what's the VC he told in eighteen plus

four is going to uh he I when I hit him

I do it in such a way to ensnare the

blade of his sword in mind pulling it

out of his hand he is humiliated as he

should be pretty cool and and after I

finish teaching this guy lessons that

was I was cool enough to uh to advantage

advantage or if you want to have some Go

juice later use that captain

just a little sippy he does not have a

sword what happens to it

well with a trailing cording to the you

go okay I'll just read this whole thing

it's a disarm this are whenever you hit

a creature with weapon attack you may

expend one panache point to attempt it I

didn't renamed it back to panache points

just be nice point surprise sounds way

better yeah

whenever I get panache it like ninth

level or whatever I was renamed rename

that to like I don't know

[Music]

you may expend one panache point to

attempt to disarm the target forcing it

to drop one item of your choice that it

is holding he was holding a sword drops

what do you call it sort yeah make a

string save against my attack roll on a

field safe

you dropped the object so make an

acrobatics check

against a DC of 1519 it goes just that

that Largent real girl like see we drew

his the flower have you seen a movie no

movie it's a movie with Lars it's just I

heard Larsen amazing scene losses in the

movie where he's frozen flower yeah

barely

robot dates end dates a robot there's a

flaw in a it's mine fly fly puncher that

was boats correct yes was it boots do

your action did you fail to react to my

reaction I get a thing if you fail to

react to my reaction never say oh it's

made not the reaction go fish just don't

lie into this boss [ __ ] but it's like

three of us are are you go oh you're

down there focus fire him I could like

just move to the side so I don't five

judges Harry your straight Street

through us like we do it doesn't hit

there's a friendly fire right correct

the idea is that you can coordinate and

say duck and judge me

the only thing you can't do is you

cannot end your trip you cannot move

through enemies and you can't end your

turn in something else subscribe okay

okay you can just reach around them

reach around free tip who's free typical

I don't think that I'm running yeah I

just said maybe hides any card up your

other way yeah yeah about that oh my god

what it's fun it's just a mosquito see

could roll across the to mosquito or is

it a crane plot

no it's neither shits a nap Wow actually

I imagine my MP's cheering on for the

drought yeah mmm it is you're right yeah

geet it's good yeah when it when it

Visser ated when it whenever a judge

would called out let said like hooray

for Sir Oliver uh I remember that what

do you say when I picked him up yeah

anyway oh it's still you yes are you

sorry sorry I think I'm gonna do great

give the boss wanker a good agonizing

blast actually want more light on health

eight damage and that's just straight-up

8m yep like so I'll give you the ability

to add your modifier yeah yeah yeah yeah

yeah it was yeah yeah I have feet I'm

sorry how much damage thank you yeah

this is what kind of damage is this you

know force force correct course yeah

agonizing blast this yeah this does

normal damage good and then here's my

second one judge duck it's actually yeah

the mini pointing ith laughter here and

then fives I again yeah to palpable hit

skink uh judge huh attack that commander

all right

nope oh you use the jury nice using his

commander ability horse of command well

I gotta get damage out so now I mean

this is a great way to do it although

like and then you can make it like could

you could you have done that with

bleach or does it have to be a weapon

attack because judges damages half it

says melee attack oh man yeah

specifically your battle you're you're

not oh yeah never guess yeah I can't

make copper yeah okay I do um ten damage

that's a big cat ten damage to the boss

mm-hmm I guess you couldn't got big cats

uh-oh that was all males King make your

deck safe for what that's bonus action

yeah or a sacred flame take reflect one

last time sacred thing uncle Li rolled

an 18 oh my goodness give up I'm using

my level of raise obsidian and my red

jasper artisan dice and you don't know

what happened to miss I'd like to roll

the dice and miss verses when we

recorded that intro Tom sat here and

roll my d twice rolling like

ridiculously well oh my gosh how do we

count a no joke no joke Ross the lion

haven't really rolled my electrum don't

touch II don't touch and if you want to

see Anna leap across the table and cry

is one of these people try to roll her

d20 and she will edit that tongues what

yeah now it's copper alright I guess

that kind of screwed up last time I was

right next to this guy we meet screwed

up well I need to hold disadvantaged if

I'm right next is that horse it's an

arranged weapon against somebody within

5 feet I think it's disadvantage okay

well I'll use my bonus action we're

nimble escape to get out backup twitch

chat will tell us a chat is that correct

disadvantage on ranged attacks versus

adjacent creatures I think it's if

somebody's adjacent to you and you're

shooting somebody else crazy happens uh

I could be

that's even more complicated when I say

chat I mean Jerry yeah to relay from

chat that's like a trend away I'll just

anything yes okay just uh ha yes yes one

or no one - yes and us right

[Laughter]

any ranged attack is disadvantage

different actors to you cuz it's like

it's like if I have a bow and you're

like right there it's not like okay no

work we were both right so I'm gonna

back up is it you just like let me have

this I almost said it it's pronounced

yeah it's you know I was gonna heal some

people forgot I heard a shot

okay so who are you talking bout my

number one God is Bowman they're trying

damage God listen I guess that's this

one here against this one yeah

ro 28 I needed nine damage and then I

rolled a twenty four or eight damage

same kind 616 do I hit that guy AC 16

okay actually yes they are AC 60 or 60

oh so I hit him or 10 damage damage her

three I guess it is or well is this a

different dude yes indeedy is so it's

got it got it thank you if they are each

there but they're battered but number

one is definitely if he were if this

were fourth edition and he were alive

he'd be bloody didn't let number three

is only taken a couple hits

none of them have done full damage so

that was copper it's judge okay put a

seal on this dude I need to swing a

straight forward and I said is that your

last seal new I'm healed yeah I guess

you have five normally I got four seals

maybe your security or because you're so

eight plus I did hit I I wrote the 96

was 2 is 8 8 plus 5 is 13 damage on the

first swing 13 damage to the boss and

I'm actually gonna go ahead and use the

I'm gonna suit in the steel right now

actually wait

Yeah right no not okay yep so I'm gonna

go ahead and swing a second time yep oh

these are both choose so I did four plus

five so I'd do nine damage 9 more damage

yes I mean there are yeah there are

they're as low as the ill rigger levels

up there are other things that get in

there are spells that get where it's

like if you have a seal if I haven't

seen long you and you go invisible I can

still see you hmm

right if I have it and I'd like to

probably do more stuff like that like if

you have a seal on you and this happens

I can do this to make it so there are

other cool tactical things you can

actually get to a team the role-playing

stuff I have to get to HP back from

whenever boots hit that guy and I was

gonna make this that was George is York

uh him tonight could you show me the

character sheet that on your kit where

says undead we're turning work so I want

to be you don't get anything back for

when I hit look no cuz any custom sto

whenever cuz he had no more seals left

on me Oh like it's uh channel divinity

turn on dead

yep yep yeah whenever he gets to me

because I just discovered that they have

immune to me

I'd like you to Crane don't wait no

they're not frightened it's explicitly

not being frightened I should say it's

implicitly not being frightened okay so

3 archers 3 archers are going to use

their Erica and use that furious assault

ability or whatever the hell it's called

it'll uh they all they all take aim at

you and you well at me uh-huh yeah

you're the one keeping your the trader

drought keeping keeping these

mercenaries alive that's right we'll

take you down and then we can start

making some progress they were all plus

6 to hit which armor class 16 so the new

1016 I rolled an 18 to 19 and a 13 I'm

going gone they're trying to kill him

for you

128 3d eight oh one two three

thirteen plus 3 is 16 points of damage

16 yep from three hits and then they

pull their bows back and they all shoot

again it's outfox all right a 19 of 15

and a 14 then they get plus 6 on top

[Music]

twenty-one points of damage are you down

I'm down Oh six zero six arrows come

down from the bridge like that now the

thing is you can react to this and move

to yourself and - anything it's just

zero right yeah you didn't take it

what's your max hitpoints wha what when

I'm fully held yeah 38 38 so you did not

just take 76 points of damage so you're

at zero yeah okay if you take enough

damage in one round or whatever it might

even be one attack but I know it's at

least one round okay

equal to your health or half your health

or some [ __ ] yeah Connie won't do

anything when I'm down well thank you

that monkey [ __ ] is gonna attack King

again he won't he can keep missing each

other it's fun

he was a a powerful drow warrior and in

life he would be too smart to do this

but now he's on debt and so he's got

look man I rolled a 16 and a 6 16 plus 6

is AC 20 so he finally gets to do a DA

10 hit me once before I D 8 + 4 7 plus 4

is 11 if you remember the next time that

you actually hit that guy like let me

know cuz he still has a seal on him well

yeah I'm just gonna swing my sword on

the next time because I'll get advantage

and I actually gets a role versus

somebody else will I miss the commander

leans over the railing looks in the

water mournfully does he take his dagger

yeah yeah we're both Lara's could you do

me a favor and take the commander and

move him all the way you guys are both

kinetic attacks of opportunity oh he's

gonna move all the way over to this end

of the thing

thank you do we still get advantage of

our attack my top opportunity coz he's

gonna release yeah sure go ahead

he's got it again he's not still be

freaking really healthy freedom allow

that man it is thinking like a DM so I

hit so I do 7 plus 5 damage I did 12

damage total to him same from me so 24

damage

total total between the two of us yes

that was a 16 plus 8 got hit so you both

you both hammer Adam he he brutes his

way past you

weathering your attacks and when he gets

to the far end of the thing he pulls out

his long boom and shines it you guys

let's see you can do one two anything he

is which so let's see actually how

healthy do you look judge feels pretty

bad or does I call HP and you were

basically fine I'm smiling TV you're

always smiling judge yeah a 2 a 5 and 11

Plus 5 is AC 16 oh honey I'm 16 okay so

he had to win to the lumber he's nowhere

near as good with his long but you can

do 3 attacks per turn

she it depends on the weapon and then

all sorts of stuff but in this case yes

but he has to do that reckless thing

right look no further force right almost

all bad guys like I think I don't know

about it works but almost all bad guys

have multi deck mm-hmm

because they don't they have many fewer

abilities and player characters do and

they don't really long so you gotta do

more [ __ ] quick I rolled that which is

Plus that on top was just four points of

damage anything

and that was the those guys and the

commander it's boots all right that's

boats boats about some boats are boats

what is this tip that you can give back

to me and you get advantage honorable

and be any role it could be a skill role

could be a thing we may have decided you

could also use it to impose disadvantage

on a bad guy if you're gonna do

something that makes them safe I'm just

like I'm really dialed in on this guy so

I'm gonna spend this and just sprint

across the deck yeah and come at this

guy with just a flurry of sword strikes

you guys see the the somnium to neveress

actually go ahead it's crit crit yeah

EEP how much damage did you have anyway

that hole do I still get that thing

where my ones or twos okay we're gonna

change it up yep

you don't need anymore yeah because

judges love it master your weapons are

the judge makes sure to procure better

weapons than normal and judge spends

time yeah oh that oh she had to call it

out nope nope any time because because

you have a because judge of the weapon

master judge will actually take time

during downtime to like sharpen weapons

yeah sorry it's one of those things

where it's like if I'm not paying

attention to you and if you do I keep it

in mind then it's like even for myself I

forget about it that's that's a sign

that's probably a bad badly designed

ability should be easy to use free

calculators out

welcome panel you get a sneak attack on

here [ __ ] for future reference

there's an app where you can take a

picture of your Dyson Alam on and really

it's definitely do

it would be awesome it would be awesome

37 damn well it sounds what's half of

that that's 15 plus half of fr7 montane

if you ran out 19 if you ran out yeah 19

you rounded up when he as food slices

through his his vertebrae his go his

body disintegrates leaving the spirit of

this drow behind and it goes it reaches

out in the direction of unconscious

trader and then this astral breeze you

cannot feel but see blows past and he is

carried away and his spirit

disintegrates and the other undead are

collapse oh sweet oh that was no I

should have focused on everybody maked

extract surprise make an act make a dex

check you can modify with acrobatics

okay

acrobatics yeah let's take an acrobatic

strip

oh I would do that go get +3 on that Oh

20 20 again 23 you just use this crazy

how do I disinvite you yeah pick me out

I gotta fire they're not these loaded

dice Thanks okay nine nine so you guys

failed

six plus eleven seventeen so Kate the

the ship lurches quite dramatically as

it is beached by the tentacles made of

seaweed have pulled it on to the thing

and you to fall on your button

oh here's not bro are there leeches on

the boat Oh possibly just to see if his

body rolls off the ship

yeah yeah you're right next to the

ladder there's your friend by the way

aren't there aren't there other like the

whole chain is on I'm not the whole

chamber though this crazy so cuz a crew

on the ship at this point from from out

of the nasal cavity and the eye sockets

of the giant skulls like 20 or 30 feet

tall skull that appears to be buried on

the island comes streaming a horde of

skeletons yeah I get the army out well

we'd better pick leech oh yeah you pick

them up zap them would turn on dead on

these because he's got to be little boys

this oh yeah yeah how often can you turn

on dead uh twice yeah and you've already

don't want time for short rest

God is hats Minh in turned guy are they

dead yeah oh just the Archery's no no

these guys all draw away and now there's

a and they refer to my notes spells do

we puts one sign king and leech make

inside checks well each is still down

right leeches unconscious so can we do

the process of picking him up like I

just have my movement up and then - I

guess I can stabilize him out oh I can

use my frontal conduit to him ninety

good night

unless I get their guidance myself I'm

gonna give you two points of health no

thanks

and then you still need me do it what is

it you want it inside I don't get

anything extra on that there's a 1667

yeah so these things are like whatever

this island is these things are being

generated by the island and they're

there little there they are skeletons

and based on your experience with

skeletons they're not going to be hard

to kill but they may never stop there

may just be a endless hoard of skeletons

coming out of this thing are still

attached what they see yeah in fact

you've been beached the seaweed has

ground cut it off Annie can we use like

is it maybe firewood encourage it to I

mean boots boots boots isn't here who

this boots back his boots here boots is

not boots LEM upwards upwards to chutes

as to shoes back and it's a city or she

chooses a who's who's still on the ship

just adjust the are there any junior

officers on the ship there's probably

there's probably some of mine I imagine

that tote is probably on there and so is

um but Cook is probably still in the

city I think who's toad toad is my as a

Toa D or Tod toh got I don't know it

could just be towed it has a different

word they mean the same thing and under

common even I don't mind you know I

throw on the website that is like a

thing yeah I sign all my crap so I don't

lose it good that mean oh yeah

especially around here like yeah

yes especially around here well I mean

any d indeed group you're gonna be let

me see that was I got two of these

where's mine which was my best back bro

need these for all these crits I'm

laying down well you know I'm

I'm not using them so okay that's what

are those Oh flee is on here too okay

so toad is a beast Lord let's do they

Lord bass yes girls always coming well

what tell me a little about the toad

yeah these guys are these guys the part

of the ship crew is only the ship cruise

with us yeah I don't think toad would

have gone into capital Oh totes got like

this menagerie of weird creatures that

he kind of like hangs out with and he's

not like he's like nonverbal um so toad

is uh he's like a really old elf that

hails from the jungles of ex wait what

well no man you didn't tell me that they

couldn't be there yeah well he's he can

be an old elf but he's not thanks well

he's something for mix it okay yeah he

can be he can definitely be he can

definitely be from ex hmm but daddy

elves don't know he's a he's a wild man

of X then he's like a Aztec dude okay

just let you know you can be an elf you

can be Fricks but there aren't elves

from X um there was no way for an ax to

know this by the way no but he uh he's

got um his skin is like a really dark

brown but he's got a I think it's Browns

like vitiligo where it's got like white

patches over it and stuff but it's like

in cool like like Warhawk patterns

essentially kind of like the poisonous

frogs from those jungles that's why they

home toad oh cool yeah but no as far as

like what I wrote is that like no one

knows why or when he joined the chain

but he's just kind of always been here

like he just has survived through

everything and then fully Polly was my

first my first retainer that I made and

so please foe is the circus wasn't

working out so I remember that phileas

like this really I talk and he's like

Burt he's a goal but like fur goal he's

like Winky he's like he's not as like

he's not as healthy looking I think it's

Gold doesn't have any stereotypical kind

of conan looking fried skin like he does

so how big the long black hair and

surely stringy and greasy and said it

was say he does not take care of himself

very well um he is a skinwalker cool and

so his whole deal was that he's to be in

the circus doing shows a few times a day

turning into the wolf boy

and they were cutting him out of pay and

so he decided to quit and say yeah

working for the chain would be huge not

much more dangerous yep and then of

course butts is here but does the Condor

ah

I'm just trying to imagine what it would

say I don't think ty would say anything

yeah well you think so represent all

right this is worth I'm trying to flee

from right now I didn't believe in

somnium two nippers behind ya and have a

boat yeah that skeletons are just are

they close to the boat now well they'll

get there in a second that al-qaeda

terrorist

there's no tinier than tool yeah that's

something people from X can do oh really

you didn't know that that explains a lot

why he never [ __ ] talks this is

something people mix can do alright so

totes gonna handle rank and file here

but we need to go in and figure out

whatever it is that send me these

tendrils out and we need to destroy

whatever is inside of this this cave so

we can get out of here

there's like twelve I don't know how big

how big do you imagine the crew of the

boat are yes so yeah they'll follow

their the the rank-and-file soldiers who

make up the crew of the boat who were

there's always 10 eight or ten whatever

they will follow the Ixion they'll

follow toad and they will come up on

deck and they will fight the skeletons

long if you guys bring you guys to be

something else yeah we need to go and

basically stop what's creating these

things these skeletons are not only are

they skeletons they're also minions okay

so I mean they're not these guys yeah

yeah they're if we actually ran the

battle eventually these skeletons will

overwhelm the crew but it's gonna take a

long time okay so did you have something

that like increases like if I if you

receive healing that you like Gillian

huh sorry now as you say I was gonna

heal you but

you can have a quick for our rest Dirty

Picture wins I'm like I have kids yeah

oh oh hell you Anna go ahead and all to

d8 + or I don't feel like rolling

anymore oh nice I don't feel like

rolling anymore what are dice I could

probably huge plus for your healing

spirit oh yeah you have the best healing

spell in the game bases yeah doctor

requires assistance yeah I'll do I saw

the human spirit yet unique any but

we're about to move though huh I mean we

should we should still go ahead and roll

yourself at the 8 OD maybe maybe we'll

do a heel that can heal all of us for to

d8 but we don't have time because the 2

+ 4 6 so now I'm married

wait I want I have to sneak by these

dudes wait a minute

this was perfect I'm just building okay

yes I could he'll attack the ship if you

are jump off yeah I've got cure wounds

to your back that time on you do it at a

third level so that be 3d8

for Cubans yeah because spells you cast

are always at third level maybe I should

cost cure wounds of my so cos eights

pretty lie right yeah well what about

coppers killing oh you're gonna help me

cover I don't have to stand there

basically in this healing fount you're

just like there's a you you just like

the way that we spell works as if you

yes I got healed back in step a bit okay

we could do that on a compound do

anything you can do in combat you can do

either combat but Matt made the ruling

of doing it only update your level yeah

you're low as you just do it for one

minute Cruces like yeah like fully heal

everyone

it's out combat philately okay but

that's [ __ ]

yeah fair enough so I said it's limited

by the number I think there's actually a

real ruling from Jeremy Crawford I don't

know what it is but I limited it to a

number of nice equal to your current

level so for him that's six nice so you

can do I could use a little bit too

because I'm at 19

so there's five five heels for which

would be your level 6 one be six so I'm

level six now let's write six of them so

one D 666 so you roll that you use your

spell so I was up the anthem yeah for

you okay so by the way it doesn't all

six of those guys don't have to go D

yeah I don't know who's lemon I know

much do you eight if you want your max

your points though yeah what's your max

avoids 45 okay so I'll give you I'm 22

out of 58 let me start with you and give

you them three right I'll start with the

cheese denied them six seven eight nine

mmm-hmm like it

no nice 17 in total no and then Laura's

you have 1945 I've got 22 out of 58

seconds look your ones myself

I'll give Lars to a Nana one P folks

won't see my notes for this they'll be

public after this adventure I think

which is probably like another I'm

guessing how much to six maybe this week

it's certainly not this week but if you

weren't even right now they're on page

work frame they are available to patrons

along with some a they're not only my

notes but some of my commentary about

how are you doing blah blah and all that

stuff about yet I thought that guy would

be a proper swordsman you can ask

questions laughs you have patron con use

and then you can be asked on a recall

show it's already cool hosting on chain

reaction so handsome

even now I hope people now that you've

been with us know for a couple of hours

and people have got to see more of your

personality in place now I hope people

understand why we why we invited you to

play because you're a lot of fun to play

with you take your character seriously

you wrote a background

and what are you doing all those

terrible things they say that's coming

out so 17 they all feel a bit better

everything all right all right

turn inside when this skull it is 10:30

storm the cast there is no way this

battle is gonna take less than about I

would say 90 minutes Oh slim emerges

from the ship up from the from the

pilots room and now with his with his

with the ship being beached and

basically on its side he says what did

you do to my ship and he will be joining

us next weekend we're gonna try and fit

one two three four five six seven people

around the table all right let's see

what happens so we're not going to kick

you out until this adventure is over

yeah so so r.i.p Jerry trying to figure

out how to get Mike remove oh well we

can just we can if they where they sit

we can just readjust one of the mics to

kind of get to you you've got a lot of

gubbins and more people around the table

for code names and we streamed it but

obviously dungeons dragons takes a lot

more real estate yeah so two people or

two or three people are gonna have to

get really chummy Cody I hope you guys

had fun watching him I had a blast

tonight I am quite enjoying this I think

this is a really cool adventure there I

mean obviously I would say about in the

[ __ ] VM

it's our first proper dungeon I guess

[Music]

that's true mine I mentioned this in a

patreon post but this is I enjoyed this

was not one of the jobs that I thought

you guys would have available to you but

because because you guys took the

somnium to memberís I thought it would

be cool that one of the options was

something that you could only do if you

have the somnium to nippers and so

anyway thanks to the mods for helping to

keep our chat sane I mean

happy with our community I'm proud to be

part of its leadership I think our

twitch chat is great I think our discord

is amazing you know it's just everything

they say about how awful chat is I do

not find to be true of ours so thanks

for watching thanks for hanging out with

us thanks for donating the last couple

of hours of your time to watch us

pretend to be drow and goblins and yeah

so I know if I'm forgetting anything but

I think we're to stop I'm gonna press

the [ __ ] off button until next time

see y'all seeing you

[Music]
