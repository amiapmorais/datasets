we are MCD and productions and we play

D&D we are Motorhead are we play rock

and roll

[Music]

[Music]

hey welcome back this is part two of the

game that we played last week so you are

watching this in our future which

interesting time travel as possible that

some of us meet maybe will be in chat

that's a rare opportunity for us to get

to actually be in chat when something is

happening so we did we normally have

announcements here but it's it's late

and I'm wiped out I wanna get to the

game but we do have more fan art we want

to show off that we have so I don't know

how we can will it doesn't dr. Manhattan

gift that somebody posted when exploded

he apparently apparently I look like

Liam's character from Chrissy killer

yeah yeah yeah hey it started this is

mine mine a character that's that's back

before she was a bone double my dog

turned into a bone double kneecaps back

when she was just like a buff Shiba this

is right before oh that's sweet

reflection

[Music]

are you wearing the blood so your armors

gone that's cool

chickenpox sick about measles your

parents were when last we left our

heroes you folks had just cleared out

the infestation of changelings on the

somnium to neveress thereby freeing you

guys to the best of your knowledge from

the influence of Ajax the invincibility

can no longer follow you and exactly

where you are and King gave a a prepared

speech to the rest of the crew letting

it rain oh hey it's not the end of the

world and not very inspiring speech

cheerful fair inspire inspire

I collect so yeah now it's you guys have

about another one more night on the

somnium to neveress and then you guys

are gonna be within you look as we out

of the Maelstrom so to speak so the way

the astral sea works is this it

corresponds to the mundane world is just

not one-to-one space and time are weird

so you guys are it's been one more night

here there's anything else you want to

do on the somnium Jeanette worse it's

gonna take butts is gonna work on

getting a potion made out of the brain

so if you guys have the brain of a

creature in this case the brain of a

changeling

you can if you have an alchemist the

alchemist can turn it into a potion of

controlling that creature so if you if

you encounter one of those things again

and if you get a potion out of this and

I think there's there's I think it's

base money

rules for it it's in struggles and

followers the alchemy test and how to

create it you can create arrows of

creatures slaying you can create a

potion of invisibility to that creature

so they can't see you you can make it

depends on which organs that you harvest

and the brain is hard but if you get it

then you get the potion control so you

drink the potion and you get dominate

that thing whatever it is alright so if

you come across one of these again and

you have the potion it is possible you

could dominate I should I should warn

everybody that even though you're

watching us at around seven o'clock it's

like 10 o'clock our time so this is

going to be a slightly truncated episode

is there anything else you guys want to

do on the somnium to neveress before you

get to kappa look at the changelings

sorry that wasn't it right correct

yeah i want to feed the mind flare to

 okay ASAP does anybody object could

we could we take that brain to him and

see if he can like extract any knowledge

from it it's dead brain I don't know if

that does anything but he might eat it

you try to eat the other one and get

some up power they can screw us

over can we can we talk to the mermaid

does the mermaid know anything about

anything more about that my employer and

her time as a prisoner she has the same

number of feet as she's half permit but

yeah as you can she's helping with the

she's currently with some other people

painting a symbol of the chain on the

we're gonna use this that's right have a

medallion of thoughts yeah she is as

loud is currently basically serving as

you know repair crew on the ship working

with working with the members of the

chain who have been say Luther before

which is like a lot of them have that

background and she just does what they

tell her to do and they'll report back

like you know

- she will say she's a good worker like

she's happy to have something to do she

actually was it was it was cook who was

in charge yeah and cook is like cookies

yeah she's Uncle Sam she's great

did you ever I like I like her she's

awesome yeah well it's true she's true

but this but but she's actually knows a

lot about spices and anybody that knows

how to cook is okay my book she says

yeah she was I think I think that she

could be useful like I don't think she's

just a gardener I think that uh she's I

think she's had some experience we asked

her what she Gardens know what does it

what does he yeah

what is a water lady growth well she had

a she worked she worked at a like an

alchemist shop working on working to

grow the kind of crazy things out it was

like I have Newt and stuff like that

obviously she's no she wasn't growing

newts but you know like do you need you

need like Mandrake root for some stuff

but you need Mandrake root that has been

harvested at a certain time of the year

under a certain phase of the Moon and

there's all sorts of other crazy stuff

and that's kind of version of she's kind

of like half druid basically yeah and

yeah so cook cook things she's great she

seems she's still like shell-shocked

although cook wouldn't use that phrase

she still gets frightened easily and you

can tell because anytime she's scared

it's like a wave ripples across her skin

that's that white thing that happens

same time she's very easily startled so

it cooks like I've kind of learned to be

you know like say her name hey dearie

hey it's me it's me cook and then she

knows what's going on but yeah she's

happy to be painting the chain of Akron

symbol on sales she's gonna ask if

that's finished yet it it'll be finished

by the time you get to capital you'll be

finished keep her feed the mind flayers

of the ship well we can use the

medallion of thoughts to read its mind

how does King feel about feeding the

mind flayers King you're in command

I don't like mind flayers Lars doesn't

like mind flayers

I'm not I mean I don't think any human

nor should you they will kill you they

will eat your brain they will enslave

you take it from me thank you lucky they

do it in that order mm-hmm I'm trying to

think what kind of information we could

get form from him that would be helpful

well I mean it's he's a you know he's an

evil Alchemist mind flare from the world

below he knows lots of you guys

don't know about so I don't know like

you guys aren't as far as I know you

weren't in the market right now for

there's this weird thing happening we

don't understand animus but like on the

on the list of like knowledge sets that

you guys don't have but my flavor would

rank pretty highly

yeah can't trust them I mean I'm never

be able to rush it means you will never

be able to trust that creature I mean

yeah the longer you keep it alive the

more chance it has to escape and yeah I

mean on some you'd be fools to let me

live which path we should take if we

decide to let him live but well if it

will be wheeler well I can't imagine

it's not gonna be well but I'd go for it

is it Audrey that's wheeler well yeah

okay because there's a couple you can't

trust Devils either I could ask my god

[Laughter]

you can trust Devils to make the choice

that is best from them what a question

is the mind flayer says that's exactly

as far as you can trust me

I can't imagine what possible threat I

could beat you here in this cell mm he

says pulls it to collar I'm just kind of

curious I want to see what Asmodeus has

to say and it's not a spill slot so why

not just gotta casually listen nobody

watch me she actually was sure she has a

title now I am a marque Appel she's yeah

she's Marquette I've got his direct line

yeah he is picking up the phone

devil in action week we might now

everybody's leveled up it might be cool

for the people watching if we did a

little roundtable of what abilities you

folks just got what did you get it six

long

well I have an additional do list point

and I am now and an expert which means

that I have a double proficiency bonus

in acrobatics persuasion insight and

stuff so I got uh this is based off of

Matt's modified piece changer at six

level your allies use your dexterity

results when moving stealthily as long

as they remain fifteen feet of you so we

can all move so when he makes a stealth

check as long as you're within 15 feet

of him you get his result you can always

si it you can always decide to make your

own check if for instance you suddenly

had like a thief in the party or like a

duelist who is really good at oh you can

always use your own result I thought it

was if you're a heavily armored

character it's not good at sneaking it's

basically like walking in his footsteps

follow me do what I do and now you can

use his what does I gotta build ability

score improvement that's pretty cool you

get a lot of those fires yes yeah

apparently you get them like every

couple levels that's awesome so in

addition to two more spell slots at the

third level which is a new level for me

I also am now a marquee appel which

means that doubles will not attack me if

they see me if I see a double I can

haven't make a Christmas savings check

basically and if I beat it

it will now behave as if I am the

that devil I don't know how any less

cousin safe so forever I guess that's a

good point it's probably their algebra

duration on their duration it's it's

this is like if you're gonna use the ill

rigor you need as the dungeon master you

need to be aware that it is literally a

knight of hell that's not a euphemism

it's not a euphemism so so don't don't

just don't get frustrated as a dungeon

master with an ovary of the party but I

keep on these demons and they just don't

as why'd I do this just be aware don't

run a very demon centric game if there's

no rigor because otherwise a demon or a

devil they keep saying demon is Devils

devil center game demons demons don't

the same thing so you gotta be careful

heavily devilish focused encounter that

you're doing hey guys remember me oh yes

yeah what would you like sir

what does King get actually didn't King

change his back yes I'm a seal is that

it's a fire and thunder cleric cool

pirate is that what is that from

it's from the plane shift planes what

the hell is that it's a thing I don't

think it's in that book I think it's

extra things that they released on it

okay cool what is the zeal Claire mm

they're kind of a mix between a tempest

and light clerics which is what I wanted

to be okay what does it mechanically

mechanically they're the kind of I guess

actually they're kind of more like

paladin's so they get smites oh they get

smites yeah it's my system and they uh

they get fireball they do not get

thunder but they get or they don't get a

call lightning but they get shatter

that's cool yeah so then at level 6 I

get

resounding strike when I deal Thunder

damage to a larger smaller foe I can

push them up to 10 feet away and I can

use my channels of Envy twice now and if

I use turn on dead and the undead or

under one half challenge rating they

just disintegrate serving some undead

boys they have to be really weak to go

find a first-level party

and believe them and take over their

adventure when a whole bunch that's

going to show up haha I think I know a

first-level party that wouldn't go in

the dungeon so you're talking he's

talking about Oh Dee Dee that's true

there was that dungeon sitting out there

waiting being a being lonely in forlorn

wishing some adventures would come and

explore it so that's where we so

everybody has leveled up and now judge

is going to cast Audrey and consult the

bones for the cards alright I was really

we are going to design a augury deck

alright so he turns over a card missus

star on it which is appropriate I

consider your own natural sea correct

two minutes strong now deed does Anna

know what's the star card symbolizes so

they so you're saying what question are

you asking I think I know but I'm on I'm

asking if we if we let the mind flare

live and join the chain live and join

the chain what are the what are the

results because it's not like a booming

we had a birthday Banks Laura's birthday

by the way or birthday we had a birthday

party for Lars and he's smiling or too

late it was a week ago it was in the

distant past from your point of view in

our recent past these time travel

episode you're so confusing um well

we're in the astral yes the city right

time does not pass

normally yeah so happy birthday Lars I

wish you guys could've been his birthday

party he seemed like he had a great time

unlike whenever you see him alright so

yes judge does judge judge actually uses

a deck of cards does judge just plop

down on the floor do you grab a table

the mess or something do you go to your

quarters where does this happen does

everybody else get to watch this this

card reading no judge will just go off

to like a Cell real quick essentially

just kind of like just dude okay cuz it

won't take as long as natural C so the

Atun is a lot stronger here you aren't

you're literally closer to Asmodeus here

than you are in the mundane world

judge judge returns from his

consultation

did you with his demon king I'm just

like we're gonna let slim execute him

okay he enslaves limb yeah I wouldn't be

cool do we sold the montclair he's got

in your pack somewhere okay cool

well we're gonna get two more right here

so all right so you'd like what is the

process you guys go through to execute

this mind player that's right now he's

in a Cell well I can open it with the

Rada command but we need to be prepared

for him to probably try to spring at us

so actually would you like me to suggest

something to him to make this a little

easier for you which he won't put

himself directly in harm's way but at

least I can tell him like you know

basically he's helpless

he's got that collar on - yeah I think

he just wants to go in and he's the one

with the Rado command pack him down and

no I'm saying what he wants to do you

have to go in and

well then I'll open the door and I say

these doors then I walk all right slim

will walk in tell him to kneel kneel

creature he shrugs and says I've never

been very good on my knees so you just

say he's not gonna sit there all right

slim slim execute the mind flayer just

now we grabbed him by the legs take his

let's take his body actually the gun

because remember they didn't stop

working okay can I have the net well no

remember they shot at us and they didn't

know my players slim nose had the gun

more guns work does he or no yeah what

man no how do they work

you you give it a living brain and it

gets a certain number of shots based on

how powerful the brain is well we got

our brain give it living a living brain

yeah you take a human you take a person

and they know you take their head and

you shove it in there as they scream and

kick because you're going to kill them

and the turret the turret eats there

grabbed it then like that let you aim

and you can like a turret yeah you could

do that you could do that but it would

you would be you would be you would be

dead basically you can't once that

starts eating your brain you can't stop

it so okay so basically those turrets

are useless unless we have prisoners

which it's pretty all right well this

limb will basically grab the thing by

its foot and drag it to the place where

you feed it to the ship and dump it in

okay no problem

unceremoniously so yeah the ship gets a

tiny little bit of nutrition it needs a

lot more though it's still we're gonna

slow let's still hunger get out and you

guys spend the night and the next

morning the Navigator alerts you to the

fact that you are now within range of

sublimation is what I call this one's

called is what that navigator calls it

which is moving from this plane to

another plank

I don't I

slim will inform inform the commander we

can we can reenter your I don't know

whatever you call it your reality now

world their whole world your world

they're just called worlds like what

like the cosmology of D&D the different

planes only only sage can reenter your

world now we don't need to batten down

or anything for this one right there is

like a transform attack there's like a

mode the ship goes into but it's already

in that mode okay like you don't you're

not currently like the sales aren't for

old or anything like that or they're not

unfurled you're in the interdimensional

travel slim will sit in the pilot's seat

for this just in just in case your honor

are we in the next day right now yes

okay that's right now I lay me down to

sleep I think he's gonna kind of like

inquire about what just happened okay

yes you're a night you're not so we have

movie talk about we you can like I guess

like judge is kind of like being an

is like being a really really devout

priest like you know a lot more about

you know a lot more about whatever the

doctrine is then an average person in

the cult you would be like an expert and

yeah you're currently you're not miss

knowledgeable in nethack there's a ball

and chain you have to drag around you

don't currently have a ball chain around

you but yeah you are suffering under you

basically have to atone you have to

atone you have to do something make

Asmodeus happy that i mean if you did

that for long enough that would probably

do it yeah but it would be like guys I

can't go on an adventure

[Laughter]

yeah and I don't know if this has ever

happened to judge before but you know

what it's like if you you know what it's

like when has mrs. angry like there's a

whole like list of stuff you can do and

it's generally speaking just like

feeding souls to Asmodeus will do it so

if there's especially if they're like

like if you killed well - she was a bad

example but if you killed like an enemy

paladin oh yeah he'd be like I'll take

your job you're fine

or if you convert an enemy if you

convert an enemy alter or you you could

if you started like a if you started a

cult Asmodeus when you get the capital

that would do it keep you like awesome

good job we need more of those normal

everyday starving it's in the handbook

that Sloan would have been what's that

give the my player soul over the demon

or devil whatever yeah you could have

suggested it the eternal pain for it I

would imagine some would have been into

that yeah sure yeah especially kids now

you'll know what it's like

to be a slave yeah yeah another earthly

opportunity missed

so yeah the the Rosso Cielo is nearby

because the field that the Navigator

generates can encompass the ship and to

other ships so if there's anything else

you folks want to do it's gonna be like

you guys gonna check you guys gonna

traverse the time escape punch it Chewie

hi I go a wave goodbye to the fish

Fisher yeah I was gonna say we should go

and nails some of the other slim gets

into the captain's chair and to start

probing his skull and the Navigator

starts listing coordinates and as the

navigator is is plotting a course

through dimensions it just seems like

the walls of the somnium to never start

to glow and first it's just the veins

that run that are normally lit they're

normally they provide some luminescence

they glow brighter and brighter within

the walls start glowing until eventually

you're you can't keep your eyes open

you're blinded and even covering your

eyes there's still this brilliant

brilliant light shining through and

there's a roar like a like the ocean

like the Maelstrom in your ears this

incessant white noise that you cannot

block out and the ship lurches and then

the lights go out and now you can see

again except there's you've got all

these like sun spots in your eyes you

can instantly tell you're on another

world because the smell if you're

anywhere near one of the ports if you're

anywhere near any of the guns that just

have open open ports to the sea you can

smell saltwater now you can smell the

spray

natural ocean as life and and stuff like

that if you can what does that smell has

slim been to the mundane world before I

don't know I would say I would say no

well no he would have had to have been

because in order I mean unless you do

something different with your gift they

don't age and you know age in the astral

right so it would have had to go to some

well he's been to other port or he's

been to other mortal rounds like he's

been to alloy in quintessence right

because that's what that you were slave

on the ship is it I'm gonna say no he

hasn't been to this world well it's

definitely a very organic smell like the

smell of the sea you can smell that this

is unlike the astral sea which is almost

like there's there are things that live

in it but they are few and dangerous and

the water isn't isn't seawater the water

is fresh water here it's it's you could

get to your nostrils

it smells like bacteria and it would be

an assault on the senses yeah creatures

go to the bathroom in this water ER and

all sorts of aromas mixed in there is

not necessarily something you whether or

not that's Pleasant but I would think it

would be not please' to folks like boots

and a lot to all of the human crew dogs

they want to get out of making sucks and

you can hear them you can hear the there

you can hear some of the soldiers saying

the Sun you can see the Sun because

they've gone up to the gangplank to go

around the castle that's built in this

thing and yeah there's it's brilliant

blue sky it's shortly after dawn and you

guys are it's still like there's a lot

of fog on the on the sea but the sky is

mostly clear cool so as we proceed

towards towards our destination Slim is

gonna give this ship - permission to

feed on anything okay

get its tentacles on as we go I don't

want to take the ship off course I mean

it can it can it can filter feet so it

can get some nutrients just from moving

in this water it's not true in the

astral sea right but I imagine like I

mean it's gonna come across stuff right

yeah sure swim the tuna swims by rabbit

yeah yeah yeah they could eat everything

you can while weird okay so it's gonna

take a little bit longer to get the

capital otherwise cuz the ship is gonna

be like every once in a while this ship

just kind of like that and you're like

what the hell's going on

and then just stops and you see the

tentacles kind of splash splash splash

splash because this ship is alive it's a

living creature and then it just kind of

and it's a fight in order to for it to

move at all you have to unfurl the sails

because this is no longer the mind hour

of the astral see now you're under and

the somnium to Nimbus is not a fast ship

normal using normal wind power it

doesn't it doesn't have rigging like a

normal ship it's it sails will work and

you'll get some propulsion but it's

sails are build an angled mostly to

catch the psychic wind of the astral sea

not not a real wind wonder if we can

modify it well once we get to capital I

mean we could well we had we had boots

establish a crew and they're gonna be

maintaining it so that could be what

they're doing lower the tentacles don't

help it move octopus swim it's not the

tentacles are octopuses use jet

propulsion the tentacles are like maybe

if you took the ship off it and let it

do what it does normally maybe but the

way the ship built onto it works is that

the tentacles are it's just these

forward-facing attack things it does it

it's no it doesn't have the mobility to

use them to get around whenever this

creature was before the mind flayers

enslaved it now it's a weapon yeah it's

your friend real all right oh yeah how

do you think the capital is gonna

respond to this think of a new stock oh

well there's plenty of strange things

that dock in capital I don't know if

let me think about this for a moment

[Laughter]

[Music]

yeah

the the only issue is the Imperial Navy

is gonna want to inspect it right which

we I mean it's our ship now so uh might

be able to persuade them to give us a

pass on some of the stranger situations

we've got going on here so like with the

with the picture of it how much of it's

in the water like it's the pipe and the

Navigator has fans on like what the

theme of the ship is and how far it's

there's a term for how much of a boat is

submerged in the water but it's like the

it's I'm guessing I mean like it's know

if we submerge it enough so that most of

the really weird is below it's no

more it's no more submerged or run

submerged than it was in the Astro see

it's just floating there's some of the

ship is below and the rest of its above

but I imagine like the tentacles are

mostly underwater yeah yeah yeah

although they do come up out of the

water they do they they're not they're

not all underwater you can see them

moving in grasping things I would

imagine that if we could keep the ship

from eating other ships like there's no

way other people which we could keep the

ship from eating other ships and people

right

captain yes do it unless you say to do

it you got my ocean I'm afraid in fact

the twitch stream got muted by nethack

because of some song that I accidentally

played I don't even think it was on any

playlist I was listening to I think some

track that I was this new ended and

another track started playing on the

soundcloud that was a copyright strike

so I gotta be careful what kind of stuff

we'd like just start meeting stuff the

good news was it only muted that part of

the stream it didn't get the entire

thing that's right so I didn't know it

was gonna work that way admit it too so

yeah the it's you guys are about an hour

out of capital at the rate that the song

named never smooths the Navigator

brought you in really close to the city

cool good job navigating the crew are

noticeably excited the Ross OClO is is

pulling ahead away from you guys because

it is a much faster ship well maybe we

should go what the Rosco's yellow to the

docks because they're gonna take longer

to get there and we can talk to them

about what's about to happen well you

don't have to somehow signal those raw

sociologist yeah they said they never

wanted to see us again

yeah I don't know if they actually want

to go to I think well I mean that was

not they weren't okay they're going to

capital to get another job to make sense

just carry on living their lives yeah I

don't know unless we have some sort of

like a messengers if there's like a life

billet or some sort of like landing vest

you guys how I'm gonna get you guys have

the know like so is there like a junior

officer in charge like we connected over

and yeah but now you're in the real

world and they're like okay see you guys

like well we talked about how whenever

we got to the docks though like I asked

Edisto we'd be able to speak with him

about how to procure like

licenses needed for spell casting and

stuff like that as well

I thought you agreed to you have to find

it when you get the docs yeah that was

also before before all the crazy

before the illicit ship showed up before

nails exploded before and is there

anything you folks want to do like you

thing you're lacking right now or one of

the things our guys are lacking is you

don't have the normal flags that you use

to communicate with other ships with all

right because this is a little ship and

the way they communicate is so what do I

mean do we know what flag to do we know

what the flag that says hey everything's

cool like boots would know I'd assume

yeah sure yeah there's there's different

flags with different colors and they're

basically just two colors they're square

flags

they usually have a diagonal through

them and depending on the colors if it's

a solid white flag if it's red one side

black on the other communicates

different things like like why we're

here you know whether or not we can be

bored and stuff like that well exams

wondering like if we have a sheet you

know like flying if flying the white

flag is like hey it's cool we're not

here to fight you sure we can make a

crude facsimile of one yeah a white flag

is no problem that's kind of a universal

symbol for dog-dog attackers but as loud

and some of the other soldiers have

painted on one of the sails the symbol

of the chain yeah you guys were the knot

you want to like just fly it a signal so

soon where we are right now yeah but you

don't think that you don't think he can

figure it out but we know he doesn't

want to be in capital capitals at the

end of this conquer line

and certainly okay but that's not an

answer to the question do you want to

fly black well well we need you're not

there if they see our symbol on a

mindful airship they're gonna know it's

not mine flavors coming - sack

cattle so humans and online players I'm

top deck like waving and being happy and

sure that probably sends a pretty good

signal as well I suppose I think we

might as well fly it I can't think of a

reason are you thinking like if you do

have what I won't work in a just sees

that as we dog know he would what do you

would even does even have anyone in

capital agents yeah he's he's some one

of the most powerful entities on the

planet yeah he has a faceless

guard on your ship somehow so yeah it's

yeah it's not like it's not like Capital

is an AJAX free zone it's just that

there's a lot of people who don't like

the guy and it's gonna be easy to find

allies easy to find allies there and

it's the it's as King said it's the last

it's the last place on his

world-conquering itinerary although you

guys saw the Christ Appa was just up

here in the middle of black bottom where

it was supposed to be like 2,000 miles

away so what that that's what that means

who knows so the somnium tenebrous

slowly makes its way across the sea the

the marine layer that is kind of

shrouding the city parts and you see the

city of capital it's the greatest city

of this or any age the city of the great

game its massive it is the largest city

any of you have ever seen it is larger

than alloy it is larger than the capital

city of quintessence it's mostly it's

its size is in width it's not there

aren't these huge skyscrapers but there

are many multi-story buildings

and they're all like random it's not

there's not like one big central and it

seems deep it seems like it could be

miles across and then it's it's nestled

in from your point of view in these

really old green hills that protect it

from the weather on the other side and

it looks like kind of like olive growing

country scrub lands and there's a large

island that itself is as big as many

cities that is between you and capital

and these are the docks and there's a

little cut scene where a week the camera

cuts to a woman in tower who's looking

through a spyglass and she's just

looking through the spyglass and she

pans across and out of the mist comes

the somnium to neveress and she goes

like that and puts her eye back to the

glass and someone in a moment of

dramatic savvy unfurls the sails and you

see the chain of Akron's symbol having

conquered the somnium to neveress now

approaching the docks and this woman

grabs the eyeglass and runs down cut to

a room that looks like not entirely

unlike this like a really well furnished

study and there's an old man he's baz

Lorien he's got short gray hair he's got

a little goatee and he's scribbling some

kind of notes like he's got a quill pen

and he's writing a memo or filling out a

form or something and he's got a huge

oak desk and a young woman walks in and

says sir that this is a different

character than worthless my glass says

sir the chain have arrived in capital

and he looks up and says I'm sorry what

what she just the chain of Akron sir the

mercenary company oh yes yes of course

little ahead of schedule aren't death he

said two weeks in three days she says

sir their mode of transport is somewhat

unusual and and do you guys now are

approaching as you that somnium to

neveress is slow and

compared to other ships the Rosso yellow

was already docked at one of the births

one of the on the quay and as you were

approaching another ship a much faster

ship starts to cut in and approaching

it's a huge galleon it's like a half

again as big as Ross on Cielo and it is

a clearly as a Rio and ship it is very

well outfitted it's like it's a it's an

end it has something I don't know how

many of your characters have seen before

it depends if you've served in this part

of the world but they have cable ship

yeah you can tell just by like just by

looking at it that just the sheer amount

of filigree on this ship like they must

spend a ridiculous amount of time

considering the rust and corrosion of

the sea just keeping the thing painted

in the brass polished because there is

brass fixtures even on the outside of

the boat all over the place and the the

sails have this like like almost a

texture to them like they're like

they're artisanal artisanal sails

they've got this weird pattern on them

almost like a watermark and yeah it's a

fast it's a huge fast ship and it's

going to intercept this omniums

neighbors big ram mounting the world

yeah you might have to sacrifice some

brains if you want your key you guys

have cannons to their brain power yeah

so they do have they do have they're

they're flying several different flags

they're flying what any REO and many

would recognize as the flag of capital

the princes the princes flag they also

have a highly stylized black crow on a

flag a crest and they have a thin line

they you can see if you were standing

outside if you're staying on the

gangplanks again there's not like a main

deck where a whole bunch of people can

stand but every deck of the ship there's

an outer section where you can walk

around it's usually only about five feet

wide there are ladders going up and down

this is how you get the sails up and

sails down and now these are build that

almost everybody on the ship that can be

out on this on these gangplanks it's not

a nice guy all the soldiers in Chains

are all keen to saw what happens next 30

30 30 30 you had 33 lost five so I think

you're a twenty-something now to figure

that actually I think would be cool to

actually come up with who all the 26

people left container because this is

what's left of 365 soldiers that you

guys had when you rolled into black

bottom and now there's a little under 30

hour a month and you see on the other

ship you see how are ya month

there are many fewer links in the chain

now you see a rope go up on this ship

that has a string of these little

communication flags what are they they

may use my eyes in my brain is breathing

it means halt they mean halt and prepare

to be boarded

all right let's stop and you see it kind

of like a sudden the tentacles dark

flailing in the water and you see this

Orca being lifted you just get this

sense of like you didn't even realize it

until now but ever since you ever since

you pair bonded with the somnium to

neveress you've had this kind of you're

like I'm hungry I feel like I could eat

something and now you're like oh wait

that's good look at that and there's

some like what the ship feels you feel

interesting but it's always a very minor

version I feel sated

[Laughter]

obviously Anna is neither a doctor or

I'm sorry I'm just delighted by the

possibility that somebody thought that

you have a telepathic bond of your child

anyway we're yes so yeah so the ship is

happy to just sit here and eat and it

will stop well I just I want to make

sure the Navigator realize yeah it can

eat sea creatures just not ships fish

not ships not you don't attack anything

you unless sea creatures are issues

valid targets not other not other

vessels all right what what if the other

the navigator asks what if the other

vessel is a living creature then it's

okay to eat correct if you mean if

there's another being sort of or another

ship like this one it lists like a

couple of different astral sea vessels

that are made out of living creatures

that's one of these well if it some of

these can be one of these can be one of

these if if they attack yes otherwise

leave them alone yeah it doesn't have an

opinion it's just so the this I would

say that it can defend itself against

any threats okay so if somebody in the

city decides they want to hurt it or

damage it in some way it can defend

itself well yeah the Navigator is

certainly smart enough to understand

what like what those conditions mean

right so it can take care of that on its

own right although like the tentacles

are limited like you have to get really

close to use the tentacles yeah like

it's the navigator the navigator lets

you know like it would be easier to

defend the ship if the psionic cannons

were man right literally man I think

we're going to replace those yeah so

this other ship pulls up basically like

as you guys were with Roz

hello except his face direction which

also means there's like 12 cannons

pointed just a few a few yards off the

song room to neveress the dark dream and

these you see a bunch of sailors except

these guys are all wearing uniforms this

is not like they're on so CLO these guys

have really smart uniforms and you see

also on the ship there are what appeared

to be like soldiers with breastplates

and some of the metal birds and they're

they're getting a gangplank ready to to

talk with your ship I think I probably

we're all up on the thing right yeah so

judge will call out and like look smart

to the rest of the soldiers just to kind

of like you know sure yeah well yeah

actually if if they if yeah they'll they

make the chain of Akron can look more

together than anybody on the raw so CLO

like a lot of those guys walk around

without a shirt on if you couldn't put

their hands on what they need to do but

yeah the chain of background all have

they don't have a uniform but they all

have the colors some were on their

outfit they out the collars so they can

they can sharpen up a little bit reach

out and I kind of straightened to shoes

turns to King and says sir what should

we do

did we hear about these guys centre need

to talk to them there's some kind of

guard in the city hmm if we want to get

in capital we're gonna have to deal with

capitals ways sir yes sir

so I they're two guards posted at their

end of the of the of the gangplank it's

ten feet wide it goes like about 30 feet

to link the two ships and a a man walks

out on the game walks out halfway on the

gangplank and he sort of looks like

boots he's dressed very similarly to

boots except he has this hat with these

outrageous peacock feathers on and he

has a lute slung over his back and he

speaks like he's an order he speaks with

a loud voice so that anybody who's close

to the gangplank the entryway on to the

somnium two neighbors can hear him say

you have the honor of being detained by

my lord the most honorable marquis

damasco captain of the HMS no captain

the HRP broadsword knight of the

crescent moon

Vice Admiral of his royal princes fleet

grand champion companion of the order of

nine stars commander of the order of st.

Monte Nido

and he continues he talks brother

Gregory curve chains detained the

Marquis de massacre damasco wherever he

detained the the herald continues along

the gangplank and there's a tall Corsair

Ian looking guy as very very

dark-skinned and he is he's older and he

is wearing this guy at the end of the

game playing this is a dude wearing like

an Admiral's uniform and there are a

handful of soldiers behind him and

they're all kind of coordinating to get

ready to cross and who meets the herald

who walks across can I talk to Scott

sure yeah all right I'll walk up to my

I'll go up with boots looking King and

boots yeah it was probably good well I'm

gonna let you behave oh you're the

you're the charismatic boy so well like

I've looked like a Rio into right it

might be a yeah you look like a yeah you

know if there's like the ease a bit yeah

yeah like a with it coming up to talk to

them or anything like that no

unfortunately it's not on the table

anymore you hate him kill had him kill

you fed him to the ship right man as you

said he looked like that many we might

have kept them yeah well he would look

like that mean even gave him all the

stuff the Harold approaches and sees you

in smiles and he says ah a civilized man

indeed and and likewise good day to you

sir

and might ice might I add

what a resplendent hat oh thank you very

much indeed offices after you and this

guy looks this guy is ethnically real

and this guy much like you read that's a

spitting image

he's get the black goatee he's got the

long black hair he introduces himself as

Russia re-discuss teeny Harold Harold to

the Marquis damasco and he says I shall

and you can see the Marquis is like

walking down the gangplank now and he's

got his flanked behind him are like two

columns of Marines because of guys and

breastplates and they have Howard's and

swords and he says things will go easier

earth your most expensive wife oh I

hopefully likes mine player it's pretty

sweet it's as sweet it's weirdly chewy

has a weird list very viscous well it's

it's the best we got

so I can try to sell it to him like it's

you just gonna say this is a rare

vintage it's that treat something that

you will never see ya on this you don't

know we had to go through to get a cask

of this stuff uh so this dude The Herald

is just gonna walk on the ship like he's

just gonna walk past you guys like like

it's no like it's no big deal

alright I'm gonna I'm gonna ask I'm

gonna I'm gonna look at two shoes and do

point of that guy okay oh wait wait wait

the Harold walk ya know the Harold stops

he walks up to you and said and

introduces himself yeah bounced off says

Pat says kind of as inside things will

go better with your ballistic Cynthia

this process will be a lot smoother if

you present your and then after it

having done that he acts like it's his

ship he's just gonna walk he's just

gonna be he's just gonna board the

Zambia members is the marquee here as

well he's you can see him walking down

the game can I can I do these guys are

just okey-dokey with with the well we

haven't gotten like he's not like if I'm

giving you guys the opportunity to

react but when the herald gets on the

subject embers he's good black gods he's

gonna be like start poking stuff let's

also let's also send uh the cook to go

get some of that okay he's like cooks

like cooks like I mean we've got

some we've got some REO and why well

have we just have we've got like the

chain in your supplies you have you know

food and you have some you have food to

eat and you have beer and you have all

sorts of stuff the officers you have

stuff for the rank and file but like

that I mean is it the I said offer than

the choice yep because it like you know

I never really in wine so yeah cook is

like she like I've got to get dinner

ready apparently this crap is happening

so yeah she's gonna scurry off and get

the stuff ready if she's in the company

I want to UM I wanna look as The Herald

walks past me I want to like basically

follow along like on his shoulder and

they're like let me know if there's any

way that we could know if is any way

that I can help you expedite this

process was very poor you nice to me

doesn't civilized creature uh how did

you get this thing

uh well it's a long story but who is

your commander my my commander is the

commander of the chain of Ekron and I

just you're bad light in my hand and we

call him King King and what are his

titles commander King commander of the

chain of Ekron I see he didn't happen to

attend any prestigious university

perhaps he's been given an honorary

knighthood in some far-off order you

know I'm sure he has but

don't really deal in as many titles in

the chain helps to keep things brief we

don't dwell on our past and I understand

he turns to see that the the marquee is

approaching and he pulls out a little

like basically a real and pocket mirror

and he gets a little bit of a powder he

goes gets ready for me and so yeah the

Marquis and his his his Marines are

about to board the somnium to neveress

do you stop him they have to inspect

don't they yeah but isn't it polite to

say like permission to come aboard

or I mean I don't know I'm just

wondering I guess they don't maybe ask

what they're gonna do I don't know

you're the captain or commander do it so

then the herald walked onto the ship and

boots when Turner and followed the

herald which means as far as I know you

were just standing there no I was

waiting for the Marquis Damaso to come

over he's he's gonna ignore you and just

walk past you on duty

okay well when he comes across I'm gonna

stand in front of him and put my hand

out to shake his hand he looks he looks

at your hand like you've just tried to

hand him a fish right like what is this

okay and you hear a voice behind you say

I have the honor of presenting King

commander of the chain of Acheron and

the Marquis damasco says shall we begin

the inspection

go ahead after you good luck inspecting

the ship yeah how about some wine first

oh we have something you've probably

never had Wow that's em he turns to his

men and he says my men will inspect the

ship and they all break up

in August our junior officers there was

a lot probably escort them you know they

they go in groups just break up the

junior officers like I mean I guess any

of the important rooms of slim would

have on lockdown that only the senior

officers would be able to open so yeah

but there's no make sure that we don't

have like some kind of crazy there's a

giant squid ship the herald will explain

I should say yeah the herald will

explain that they're just gonna want to

like make sure you have any contraband

which means they're gonna want to see

like every little nook and cranny of the

show they're gonna wanna look everywhere

yeah and I mean the mine player is gone

so that would have been the only

contraband I think so yeah so I hope

they're gonna send junior officers with

sure okay cat Romero you can see that

the Marines are especially we're like

two shoes when two shoes is like okay

follow me that immediately the commander

of the Marine unit starts talking to two

shoes a lot more like a normal person

then then the mark he does though not

all the Marquis

the Marquis looks to you and you take he

takes off his hat now that you're

indoors and he says is there an

officer's mess yep

well then I am your guest well hopefully

as the cook has the food up there so yes

put you as you walk down the halls this

interesting ship yeah we get that a lot

and how did you come by it we were

attacked by it on the Astros

sort of the necessity as the mother of

invention type of thing it seems to be

alive oh yes it is very much alive mmm

small sales though well we're we're

working on that

he tries that's that's his attempt to

like make small talk and yeah yeah with

King it's not working yeah Kings talk is

real

well yeah awesome like this guy's no so

he's not used to have he's nice too he's

making a very bad attempt to try to

relate to King yeah but that part of my

life is over

so uh so yeah he's gonna follow you guys

to the officers mess and he and his

Herald will sit and he's he's delighted

that you have do you have lying ready

he's all by all means what is this he

says playing the mind flayer wine well

this is a rare he'll grab a cotton ball

an exceptionally rare vintage and says

his Harold will pour his Harold because

of course he would never do anything

like one wine himself his Harold pours

the wine and wants to know if

interviewing we should probably take a

sip of it show it's not so good

the eases in anticipation of passing

your inspection welcome to capital

Cheers

don't you see it does it almost like

chokes up a little bit because you can't

really like sip it it's so viscous once

you start drinking some it's all just

going to look like it's gonna go down

your throat there's some of it stuck in

his teeth he's chewing on it

hmm very interesting but I think I'll

have the pork next time

so what is your business in capital

he said it's kind of leaning back as

chair he's got a he's got a sword on his

head and puts his hand on the sword

we're looking for work then capital is

the greatest city and this or any age

well that's true when you say work we

mean I assume you're not gonna be

sweeping the streets I think you'll find

this very little work for an itinerant

mercenary company in a civilized land we

do all kinds of jobs well you'll need a

charter to operate in the city that

shouldn't be difficult you'll just have

to prostitute yourself to some

sufficiently desperate noble I'm trying

to think if this guy's gonna ask

anything else he says is this the entire

complement of the officers of the ship

senior officers yes and what is that see

we have we have we have is it talking

about me we have and there's I think I

think there's a term for them I think it

might be like the children of Asmodeus

is the name he says we have many we have

an infestation of teeth flings in the

city currently so they I am well

familiar with happily I do not spend

much time on land but this creature is

new to me

gifts are bit I mean I don't I actually

don't really know what they are

well does that mean my best like

approximation of my parroting to

Harold's like yeah yeah pageantry yeah I

introduced you know of course this is

des gellick VM Pais

he's captain of the somnium to neveress

and the pilot of the chain of Metro and

where is where is where where I'm

where are you from he would never say I

apologize he's dominant and and did you

come with the ship suppose you could say

that and where are your people from

would say the astral plane you would

know you probably say the see it starts

see if stars only like only scientists

called yes right

that's not a thing he knows a whole hell

of a lot about so he's gonna well at

least there are some civilized creatures

among you copper's

silly had on the hill he'll do his best

to make small talk and just ask you guys

what happened how did you get here he

you know he wants to know everything to

happen from black bond he doesn't seem

like he knows anything about the channel

macro so he doesn't know anything about

your history does he know about black

bottom being destroyed how do you gonna

find I don't know if I would tell him

well I'm not gonna tell him why why it

was destroyed same we fled the

destruction when we got here a lot

faster than yeah that's what the fastest

ship that well I mean we already told

him we're looking for work and we came

here because this is the greatest city

in this radiation yeah this way he liked

that he likes it like nobody else from

black bottom could have beaten us here

any age we were supposed to get from

Modesto the breakdown all the houses and

stuff so I still I still I start working

on we have you know I actually did start

working yeah this dude is a member of

house Marone house Barona run the

Imperial Navy they are the yeah they're

the house of

there the house of the Raven or the

Black Raven house isn't it but they also

have a church they all I mean what do

you mean by Babbage's Church of Saint

Verona was something he told me it's a

note that I have when you were telling

me about the different guilds and stuff

I mean there are churches I mean every

noble house sponsors churches just not

what we could know but these guys has

claim to fame this done this and this

guy is like a a a pretty high up there

he's not the head of the house but he's

off most of the most of the ships in the

Imperial Navy their captains are also

nobles and so these are the guys that

defend they defend the city and they

defend trade so they often ask us they

often act as escorts to reel in trade

ships do they trade in cannons we wanna

buy cannons we need to read out fit the

ship he yeah how would he express this

you would have to be very popular indeed

to get a charter to buy cannons okay I

wish you luck I hope your I hope you are

I'm saying listen I think this is King

in the know I'm just curious if he was

talking to somebody else if the Noles

picky with us alone

it's the noble in there oh I see we're

in the business mess yeah and in a

little while the after its it's

probably gonna take a while it's

probably take a couple hours for those

Marines it's like six one for those

Marines to inspect the ship

is there I'm sure that because I'm sure

that cannons can be bought somewhere

possibly on the black market but of

course if we found out about that we

would arrest those people we have the

exclusive this technology is exclusive

to the his his royal princes Imperial

Navy what about sails and rigging I

think we could do with outfitting the

ship a little better to travel these

that just costs money sees there are

plenty of they're playing facilities

plenty of places in the docks this he

calls them the stays he says there

plenty of there are plenty of people in

this day's you can pay to fix up the

ship yeah he's just gonna so a couple

hours are gonna pass and he's gonna make

small talk he wants to know a lot about

who the chain are and why you're called

the chain of Akron what is the

significance of that chronically no myth

is that the chain is one of the nine

mercenary company is born from the

rivers of health relaxed to the hill

troopers yeah the last of the hell

troopers so Acheron is one of the oh yes

yes there was another of you there was

another company the the castle the iron

tower yes I remember the I entire was in

capital just a few years ago yes ah now

it all falls falls in place

they were the ones just to remind me the

iron tower was the previous mercenary

company that you just wiped out the

flying pyramid one yeah they were the

group that played it pandemic studios

what were they doing here

yeah he's what were the iron tower doing

in capital I think this was I think this

was during the princes last princess

reign when he was still alive and they

were working for they were hired by a

minor minor noble house to act if their

army there was a minor noble house that

was trying to make a play to become a

great house and so for a little while

they hired the I in tower and it almost

worked it almost works for the noble

house yeah well unfortunately they ran

into me ah and when that happened

suddenly the iron tower became a lot

less this is years ago no one fights for

free well some people fight for honor

can we talk to him about the like we

heard about the murder if there's been

any developments on that you've heard

about the murder of the murder of the

prince Oh

like what's the status of the city right

now I don't know if he's gonna want to

talk to us about any of that stuff no

probably not

like he's this is this is a this

inspection is like he wants to get a

sense of who you people are and he wants

to understand what this ship is and now

that he's been on board he basically

gets it and now he's just gonna wait for

the inspection to finish and make sure

you guys aren't now that he knows you're

mercenary company he's a little less

freaked out about what's going on so

he's so he's not super forthcoming with

details he's he's a very officious no

balloon

well I guess let us know anymore one

they couldn't do something else a

knitting the week on the after after a

while on the Imperial Navy the Marines

show up and they report and they're like

we couldn't find anything this we

usually don't like the chips mostly

empty like it's outfitted for a crew

three times the size of what Scott

didn't come furnished they talk about

the the Marines say sir can we talk to

in private

and he's like certainly gets up and

walks you know a few feet wide and they

start just going this what do you guess

it if they fill the DC and after after

the Marines are done reporting in the he

says alright well you can go back to the

there's a return to your duties on the

ship the broadsword and they're like he

says well how you have passed inspection

your ship it seems to be mostly empty

although there are many interesting

fittings on it curious about the cannon

like objects that are mounted on the

sides of the ship that's broken

well me perhaps you could escort me to

one of them is not invited close because

I saw that smile how'd it get kak kicked

out of capital he wants to take a look

at the psychic cannons take him down to

the deck that has cannons on it and he's

like ah yes I see it like a ballista

style of thing and he kind of walks up

to it says he grabs his gun he's like oh

like I was I would not walk and watch

her face he doesn't say black oz I have

to figure out what we want to say when

they say that's a very bad lorry

thanks mm-hmm so how do these things

operate and he tries to like point it at

the water slipper will explain it to him

in detail holiday bah ah

I see and do you have any plans to feed

anything into these devices we're not

that kind of mercenary company but

certainly no no no you're not I mean

that smile no the idea is to

replace these with more user-friendly it

would like it would probably be like

ballistas or something like um that you

would use to harpoon another ship or aim

at the sails up there the sales part

because most most ships in this plane of

existence do not have access to Canada

that's something I appeal Navy tries to

make sure only they have yeah I don't

know if if a gift has ever seen them

before you can see these large black

barrels right and there you don't know

what they do but there's someone ominous

note back mouths look at the whole road

mouths on the tubes broadsword

on the HRP broadsword he's like do you

mind if we you know we're not we don't

we have a prescription against anyone

else in Rio and waters using canons and

all of these aren't obviously canons it

could be used offensively do you mind if

we seal them seal them yeah it's a it's

basically put like

how would he turns to his Harold is this

I don't know the right word for it was

it was all we just like got a lock on it

and it's got the imperial navy seal on

so you have to you have to break it if

you want to use it I mean look at these

light seems fine scribes it and then

he's kinda like

as long as we can remove it when we want

to remove these cannons yeah it's just

all we have to break them and we're if

we think we're thinking about taking

them out anyway yeah so like imagine if

I don't think we want anyone else use

them then I don't know

the herald will step forward to say

merely a formality as long as you're not

planning on using these defensively

however if there was an incident around

the docks where there was damage to a

ship or damage to a civilian vessel that

seemed like it might come from whatever

these things are then we would of course

immediately expect to inspect the ship

and check out the seals were there they
