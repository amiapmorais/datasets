we are MCD on productions and we played

in D we are Motorhead are we play

rock'n'roll

[Music]

[Music]

hey everybody thanks for tuning in my

name is Matt Koval these are my friends

were a bunch of game developers and

we're gonna spend the next I don't know

20 30 minutes playing D&D this is how

you choose to spend your evening we

appreciate it sitting down and watching

people play D&D is a big time investment

I feel so thank you very much we also

just you probably already know this if

you're somebody who would be remotely

interested in the first place we just

posted a job a freelance writer gig for

players guide maybe 30 to 48 pages we

don't know how long would be probably

PDF players guide to capital that takes

all the stuff we've done in the world

building and this campaign and tries to

synthesize it into a product that people

could use to make characters and stuff

like that and give a dungeon master

inspiration to run a game we're looking

for people that have experience in this

business in this category who've worked

on a deadline and stuff like that so if

that's you and it sounds cool go hide

the hence to our website and fill out

the form when last we left our heroes

you VOC suggests completed the library

job and you'd all leveled up correct

yeah and now what can you guys do that

you couldn't do before like and I was

like is this right do I get all this

stuff and I was like we're playing red

dragon in you're going around the table

saying what your character does what for

the folks at home what can you do now

that you couldn't do before

marks forth all spells and what support

and you just gave her a cleric so just

get all of them yeah that's not bad yeah

yeah yeah that's what are your language

you make sense anymore memorizing spells

it's definitely what they use it they

say prepare I do get it from from the

type of cleric I am I get freedom of

movement and fire shield that's cool

yeah if I were shadow how much damage is

far she'll do

I've told my fire shield story I know I

can only use the fire the heat my

high-level paladin in one of my favorite

dia my favourite games I played on my

favorite characters spot the Prince of

Fire who I turned into the Lady of fire

in this game and we got in a big fight

and we were like 13th level and I hit

this dude when did a [ __ ] ton of damage

and then the DM said you take all that

damage to yourself because he was a fire

should like that's [ __ ] I would know

that he has a fire shield up you would

be able to tell that and he's like he's

a prince of fire it's built into his

armor oh that's such a good explanation

ya know what can judge do the judge

couldn't do before

so what we look at the list

yes and then I haven't improved filfil

introduced which allows me to it adds

one more d6 of damage whenever I consume

a seal on somebody after I've applied it

to them and we do we hit them and then

as long as I have any like a new shield

I get to do an extra 186 with my weapon

damage my great sword initiative to to

d6 does 1 3 6 yeah basically you can use

a nut you could as long as you have a

seal within you

yeah you can fire up all your attacks

into an extra d6 and your seals doing

extra d6 adaption yes and the other

thing I get is because I'm architect of

ruin I'm a now a scion of Asmodeus which

means I and we use that I place a seal

now get disadvantaged when saving

against my spell oh yeah okay yeah just

really cool that's not bad

no it's pretty cool what what spells do

you get it third level I mean I've had

three levels for a little bit oh you

have okay mmm but the tool rigger ones I

get are some inhale and interdicted here

at us Oh someone hell is basically the

hunger of an R except I can use it

because it's hunger of another one yeah

the and what's the interdict Tutera toss

is not the one we could put all your

seals on people I believe so it's where

I I play actually it's where I place the

seal on every enemy within B and it

doesn't use any of my seals up to - oh

right great fantastic

there's a seventh level warlock yet I

get a extra d6 for my healing light so

I've now up to eight d6 that I had a

longest chat with they're very helpful

people on discord about what I should

take and why shouldn't say yeah we have

a really incredibly popular robust I

don't know how many people are in our

discord I think we're getting close to

17,000 17,000 CMC DM discord and many of

the players here will drop into the

discourse say hey what should I take

when I level up and they'll get advice

and stuff which I think I might have

taken none so new people are all idiots

and then I actually this sounds quite

good so I took eyes of the rune keeper

which means now right read all writing

yeah including the anything in the

chronic or but that means you can read

so the idea of that the chronicle of the

chain of Acheron goes back so far that

he uses language that no one here can

read you would have to cast a spell and

now you have I mean this is a lie and

for my fourth little spell I took blight

which - one creature can take 8 d8

damage we have to touch them is that it

range thing you know things if they feet

range yeah but it doesn't work on that

yeah maybe not on golem cancer

don't you have to have a life force that

be the word yeah but yeah it still

seemed quite good that one yeah

no one bit of advice they did give me on

a discos like I'm D you're a warlock you

get spells back on a short rest

yeah you just spell something the design

of the warlock things kind of break down

if you don't take short rests then

things don't right he's gotta break down

you guys do take arrests mm-hmm what

does a battle master you as one of the

most strangely as a gift as one of the

most vanilla characters in the group

what is a palette master yeah all right

so let's see here what did I get I got

two new combat maneuvers of which I

let's see I swapped out trip attack for

distracting strike which I thought would

be more useful with this group yeah and

then I got a fainting attack which is

pretty cool you just you faint I can

pretend to faint disappears already died

use a bonus action on my turn and the

total role to gain weight would to gain

advantage it gets me avenge on my next

attack that's cool okay and then I also

took what was a distracting strike and

precision attack and I also got a power

and know your enemy so uh that's right I

spend one minute observing or

interacting with another creature

outside of combat I can learn to of any

number of things strength dexterity well

the class HP levels etc etc do you get

to choose what you learn from them or I

have to pick two from the list

oh cool any two that's not out so

there's a pretty sure that's a yeah and

I think that was why and I read that

book so I got I got a couple more wisdom

oh nice okay Tom what does copper get uh

I think it's not much I just got another

spell I took spiked growth those micro

uh yeah seem pretty good difficult turn

makes difficult and 2d for if they

walked through one five feet so they

just they also have a list I which I

didn't catch has to work

have a list of other things that big cat

can use ferocity to do oh cool so at

some point that'll be probably between

now next week I will work I will get

that dude boots was boots I have no idea

I even know how how you're kind of

barred works so I'm super curious I got

my first fourth little spell nice and I

picked greater invisibility

okay so greater invisibility is the one

where even you can combat invisibility

you could you could do stuff yeah you

can fight and does not become visible

I can I can stay visible for for up to a

minute there's a concentration spell and

it's only one minute and I can only do

it on one myself or one other creature

yeah but in other words we can haste and

invisible eyes slim basically just throw

them in the room close the door it's a

Cuisinart yeah is there any effect to

errors or any limit to the number of ex

you can have on you at one time

that's how could you have like haste as

a disability and the orders it the the

one as long as you have a spell caster

is who can maintain the concentration

then yeah because you're not the one

maintaining the concentration they are

right if one person castes and then

another cast greater invisibility so

slim will be like a Dragonball Z rule

the dungeon master you guys can do the

reason is because I that's how I figure

out my bad guys can do is I listen to

all murmur the do√≠s gar underwent

greater invisibility and

out there and zap disturber it's

somebody who shall remain nameless but

they are at this table accused me of

cheating you don't know what the spells

do so

ha what his name is the hyper servant or

is it just Percival a right honorable

Percival still with approaches oh you

folks not you I presume you're at the

stool at the foot stool at the Pharaoh's

dream and says that ladies Romi has

agreed to meet with you alright well

we'll go get boots ok she'll see us

today she will see you today if you're

available I'll take you to her the half

elf that's right now there we go so

filled with leads you through the stays

which is as I think you all know it's

like a huge city all on its own it's

roughly the size of Manhattan so divided

into different districts it leads you

through to the shavings which is where

the bank is it's where a lot of

governance of the stays happen and there

is a large stone building several

storeys tall it looks like a combination

of a church and civic building it's a

basilica it's a basilica of saint Bono

Garcia who is Saint gambling and risk

and the streets are here in this part of

the city are pretty densely packed as

people are going back and forth on

business and trade and it's a huge

building that has large archways leading

into it never closes and on the ground

floor of this building it is effectively

a gambling den there are tables set up

and people are a lot of them are playing

cards therapy

using playing dice and there are also

like one-on-one tables in the corners of

the room in the court it's large open

room stained glass windows all around

depicting the events of st. bernard sia

in life and the things he did that led

him to become a saint and in the corners

around the edges of the room are these

tables with folks dressed as like French

Franciscan friars right with simple

brown robes and they're doing

effectively tarot card readings there

they've got a deck of cards that has all

the all the gods and saints of Rioja in

it and they read people's fortunes

that's one of the kind of functions this

books work in this building perform but

the elf the half elf that's leading you

folks just ignores all these people and

and goes and hits to the stairs a lead

to the second floor on the second floor

there's now this is the fulcrum and

where the fulcrum operates and there's a

huge board on one wall is a large open

floor

lots of desks and people you know

scribbling notes Ledger's and people

taking scraps of paper back and forth of

these different desks a large board that

has a map of Orden on it and it's got

all the different trade routes and there

are these little magnets there's a Vanna

Guardian woman who she's tall she's like

six six hundred tall and she's got short

blonde hair and she's putting these

magnets up on the board and writing

prices on the board underneath them and

the little magnets all have symbols for

different trade goods and she's getting

reports from all the people different

people two desks who are getting reports

from the runners regarding what's going

on you see somebody run up with they've

got a telescope in their hand and they

deliver a report you overhear them

talking about a ship a Hegar and a ship

that's been sighted it's this far out of

port and there's a lot of activity as

they quickly change the prices

of some good coming in from agora and

this is what they do they fixing the

prices before that Gardens get here so

that they don't want to pay as much for

their goods

well it's certainly one interpretation

of it but there certainly it's a lot of

activity based on the fact that they now

know they these people now know that

this ship is gonna make it in the park

right up until now you know no right but

now they've they're they're certain and

there's all of these different arrows

red arrows and black arrows that are up

and down across all the trade routes

that they use to gauge the likelihood of

someone coming in through that trade

route of actually making it like what's

the weather like you know Wow or what

are the odds of piracy and bandits on

the high seas and stuff like that and

all these things factored into them

setting the price and that's what they

do here is that they set prices for

their people here getting loans they set

interest rates here and it's just you

know up close to a hundred people on

this floor yeah yeah I mean this is this

is not the extreme Wall Street this is

not the exchange but this is this isn't

where people invest but this is this is

like the Fed right this is the place

where monetary policy is set kind of by

almost de-facto like what the fulcrum

says becomes monetary policy or the

people like it or not there's a a third

floor and at this point you are now in

these what looks like almost a manor

house there are small corridors that

branch off into into rooms ornately

carved it looks you know it's a lot of

money has been spent to make this place

look nice and there are guards here they

have their their symbol is a golden

hammer striking a coin and they are you

know armed with sword and shield and

they all recognize the Harold who is

leading you through until eventually he

reports to these two guards that big

double doors and they stop him and they

go through the doors one of the guards

goes through the door

and person in Dilworth says I'm sure

she'll see us the remaining guard kind

of sizes you folks off it doesn't say

anything just it just stands his post

after only Amy like 90 seconds the guard

comes back and says her grace will see

you and and first event to fill with

this like you got lucky this way Slim's

wearing his fancy clothes by the way

well bats by the way I see them now you

folks apart from you by the way where's

your Minnie oh yes senior buddy tom

schmuck posted I think we posted on

Twitter - yeah I did yeah yeah I like

others like please go he's got the K

then you can see them guy he's got blood

all over him so yeah you folks all look

nice yeah prestidigitation like as we're

waiting in the hallway all sort of like

clean up some of this some of the more

obvious Oh blood and stuff just I mean

they're so it's it's when bathing one of

the things if I were a better Dungeon

Master I was more organized we would

have progressed more of your downtime

stuff that's probably gonna happen in

the next couple of weeks so it's

entirely reasonable for you to just get

close there's nothing stopping you flow

into a tailor and getting clothes so

that you you fit in but you do not have

the outfits right these folks no I don't

have the fancy you know these folks paid

a lot of money and

don't forget that you guys cuz I will

forget what you know you guys get a

bonus on your we got those usual ones

guys yeah you guys they get a bonus to

their diplomacy checks we do see in this

[ __ ] yeah no there's no iron in a

negotiation intimidation waged on the

investigation medicine that's it

performance probably persuasion yeah

persuasion yeah it wouldn't be it might

be performance but what +5 no way plus

they don't really do +2 bonuses in this

game the way they used to I think they

kind of over corrected and it used

because it used to be awful these to be

so many bonuses and I was just advantage

but avantage is a lot so I would like to

slowly reintroduce a little bit of Plus

Ones I'm sister so it's plus 1/2 it's

plus 2 when you have your to your

charisma checks used I would say if plus

2 to charisma chunks used to negotiate

I'm over 0 [ __ ] whatever skill you use

if it's charisma based and you're trying

to negotiate with somebody then they

were gonna be impressed this was with

Rioja Nobles it's in I would say it's in

capital so I can use my acrobatics since

I'm so long Christmas

scruffy hug so lady Sherrill Mays office

is what you would expect from a Rio

Noble she is dressed as a Rio and Noble

she is short she's like I think she's

like 5 4 she's got long black what

pretty the average height for a 9 year

old

[Laughter]

he's three times the size of a correct

half the size of one eighteen-year-old

she is talking to a knight he is

somewhat corpulent he's got a big gut

somebody's wearing a gold breastplate he

has that same symbol of a gold hammer

striking a coin lady she Romi has long

black hair that she has got kind of tied

up in a ponytail somewhat functionally

just to get it out of her head of her

face and they're having a conversation

and she's she's sitting behind a large

desk and there's an there's a assayer's

scale on the desk

there's several books and writing

implements and her knight is just kind

of sitting in a chair opposite and

they're in the middle of our

conversation as you walk into the room

there's a you know a lot of money has

been spent to get genuine Hegar on

carpeting which is someone in fashion

with Rio and Nobles right now and the

window behind her is a stained-glass

window depicting some event in the in

the sainthood of st. Monica at SIA and

he's asked she's asking him what do you

think whose be Oh whose side is he on

this is the conversation that you were

coming to the middle of and he shrugs

and says his own probably she says but

he stopped

alvaro from taking the pallet and the

knight looks at you folks and goes and

then let's background goes did he as

well maybe we can find out she says as

you folks approach and he stands up and

says should I leave your grace and she

says no stay I want you to hear this and

he this this guy this huge night with

this big gut walks up to you and says

well done on the palate well done

[Music]

dad involved dragons they Valerius dick

Hirano becoming a thousand infected

wounds yeah and we agree with that but

he's sawn the pellet well but for how

long though that's the question oh sorry

anyway your grace and ladies shroom he

stands up and she walks around to the

front of the desk and she our chairs

here for you folks to sit on I assume

you do not have your cat if they don't

allow cats tonight I don't think you

would have got this far with you shoroma

says in a very kind of slight voice she

says where's your where's where's your

cat I'm somewhat disappointed how did

you know I mean oh we know all about you

Oh would you like something to drink she

says and there was a table squat short

table that has tea and wine and

sparkling water on it and she says we've

made every allowance for the chain of

Akron welcome to the fulcrum

I believe she says I believe that that

is mineral water from the astral sea

don't try it they call it star water but

it's just one hmm because and she says

we have if you'll join me for tea she

has a hit guarantee set and sure there's

a cup there's two cops is a one for her

one for you I'm just gonna make sure she

drinks first in the water yeah and you

recognize the this is this is what when

you're not drinking you know alcohol

this is what gift drink mm-hmm there's

Rio and wine which I've already poured

I've already poured a glass and tried to

hand one to judge an that if there's

there's wine from I think there's a

bottle of wine that you recognize

actually several of you probably

recognize it it's uh

from alloy there's gob there's a

business like wooden mug swill awesome

I'm enjoying that wire delightful wine

she's I I don't know if I don't know if

you drink

she's fine she has one of the guards

bring another cup for tea and the you

know as you folks are talking the guard

comes back and actually it's not a guard

it's a servant that she has and your cup

is different than her cub and King's Cup

there Kurt your cup has a gold is that

the rim has a gold on it which in had

gotten the hick aren t ceremony is for

Nobles her research is not it's

extensive but not infinite mm-hmm what

do we go just stand in wine glasses I

mean there's a there was any number of

things actually there's a there is a

drow wine Oh at the table which is rare

I would say anywhere in orden outside of

capital but you're only like you know

you're not that far away from at any

given moment in capital you're not that

far away from the layers and there are

lots of drought in the lyrics spring can

that'd be crazy it's much easier for

them to get that I'm enjoying it I

haven't had a drop of dry wine for a

while delicious so the The Herald said

you wish to speak to us yeah so the

pellet seems like it's taken by the

White House I'll borrow and Captain

Antonia of the red Falcons wants to

speak to you about that the red Falcons

the red Falcons she said these precious

horses on the pellet yeah heard her

knight shrugs and nods his head she says

okay well and you met lady Antonia yeah

and what did you make

I wonder do you think that that is

sufficient to solve the problem of 12

dragons in the pellet no they're gonna

need help but that's part of why we're

here what happened so we retrieved your

messenger from there and the document

I'm a messenger she says and The Herald

says and he kind of explains warrior

better term for it he explained he kind

of says well your grace and he gives a

very short description of the job that

he hired you for it she's like ah yes

yes the courier and as we came out the

12 Dragons descended with a military

force on the pellet mm-hmm and tried to

take us prisoner because they were under

the assumption that we were trying to

take the pellet and then the knight says

on our behalf presumably in ladies room

he says right they thought that the

fulcrum were trying to take the pellet

using the chain of macron mm-hmm and

what was your experience with twelve

dragons it was a very tiny voice so it's

not like me and what was your experience

with twelve dragons they need to be

eliminated she's a she she does that to

slip quiet no she basically saying that

this guy's I mean you you know King

would know yeah that's what I'm King Lee

language basically let her know that

he's a piece of trash yeah well you've

completed your contract correct maybe

covered the document that we were

looking for yeah but we wanted to talk

to you about your plan for the document

Oh

as far as our information goes you're

trying to install somebody there who is

uh work with you hey jobs for you et

cetera then we think that should be us

as we have a ryokan noble

within our ranks I remember this

Bernadette II person you would install

interesting huh and um should we pursue

this strategy wouldn't that put you in

direct conflict with 12 Dragons I mean

who do you imagine would come out ahead

of that in that conflict well we're

looking to work together the twelve

dragons have slighted us

they've slighted you they've slided the

prince then we don't like any of that no

what is your interest in all of this

what does the chain of Acheron one

fortune and glory there's much of that

to be had the city she says so she looks

at her Knight we haven't also we've been

we've been shopping around for

establishments that we could make our

own so to speak a stronghold if you will

well there are many buildings in

disrepair many of them of military

origin especially in the princes capital

is a very old city she says all right I

don't think it would be difficult for

you to find city a city gate and

disrepair but you could invest and take

over you seem a resourceful bunch but

yours is your your plan to work with us

and put yourselves on the pellet kicking

12 dragons off well if you along with

the red Falcons yes the red Falcons will

fight alongside us are you sure of that

Oh fairly yeah well at least that crew

of red Falcons I mean I don't know if

that we don't know if that lady's in

charge of the entire red Falcon she's

she's the princess troops on the island

on the island what about

the every district well not every

district every little enclave of the

princes land that is not currently

governed by somebody else as a different

organization so you like oh well they

would have they all have different names

right or not they're not okay I see yeah

but the ones that sort of the prints on

the palette are we know that she well we

know that her lieutenant probably will

but we don't know if like the rest of

the red wagons will join us technically

like if they get a better offer right

like they're they're sympathetic to our

cause I think but I don't know if we can

fully rely on all of them when she turns

to her Knight and says dad Otto what is

your read of the situation with red

Falcons and he goes well Wow lady

engineer hmm excellent officer loyal

loyal to the prince almost certainly

willing to bend with whichever way the

wind is blowing and right now I imagine

she'll wait and see who's breezes

strongest he says mm-hmm yeah except for

what's his name 12 Dragons later dickory

no dick basically killed her yeah cut it

down yeah but have you told her have you

told them that

no well oh we can't no it's no reason

not to yeah put it put it this way if we

if we had some more breeze blowing with

us back over there the enzymes to digest

there's some videos of it's like a cat

or raccoon and a big Syria ball were

they like like in the middle of a

sentence we'll stop she gets up and

walks around to the other side of it

shows us it down and is now on the other

side of the desk and she's looking

through the stained glass window or her

there's a bunch of red and blue light

coming through on her face and she says

at this point you folks are behind her

and she says dear daughter do you think

that lady Antonia is offering an

alliance and the knight who's still

sitting sitting says ah hard to say oh

yeah

I suspect that she'll wait she'll wait

and see who comes out ahead and then

throw in with the winner might wait for

might wait for the whole thing to wrap

up if you know what I mean

find out who the next Prince might be

hmm

well keep in mind she does want to come

speak to you do you know about what do

you know what about about sure only

stated the pellet well then by all means

I guess I must meet this woman as to

your offer I would have to think it over

I'm surprised that you're so interested

in working for us I would imagine that

you'd prefer to stay neutral we would

but Alvaro's not doing things that's

neutral the city um forgive me for

overreaching but isn't your contract to

eliminate Ajax's wizard what does this

have to do with working for us or

working against Alvaro a capital B the

last bastion against a banks oh I agree

I agree and whatever else is true he is

on his way and knowing how how do you

feel about that I'm sorry how do I feel

about what about Ajax being on his way

I think that whoever the next prince is

will make it their first order of

business to stop him well certainly

there'd be I have no personal interest

in sitting on the princes throne but I

have even less of an interest in seeing

everything that we have built here and

then she turns back and looks at the

window and says all these people these

neighbourhoods and although this

territory I would hate to see it fall

under someone else's so I'll do what I

have to do and I think we can agree that

the faster - a faster we're the faster

that this issue is resolved

and then the night goes and your grace

speaks of the issue of capital and she

says yes yes the matter of the prince

the sooner this issue was resolved the

faster we can mount a defense against

Ajax I don't know how you feel about

this but certainly I don't think that

our countrymen are particularly

well-positioned to stop him the Pharaoh

couldn't do it I doubt the Emperor's can

well if capital is fighting with itself

it's certainly not gonna be able to it's

it's certainly not gonna have enough

left over when Ajax arrives if that's a

you keeps telling yourself apart and

it's gonna require factions and Nobles

under a new prince working together it's

a matter of finding out who that

Prince's well set she says she sits down

and sighs and says until then I'm afraid

things I have to get worse before they

get better I'm interested in speaking

with a lady Antonia I have question your

grace do you think that by presenting

this document you would be able to get

the twelve dragons to leave the pellet

to you amiably

she looks around on her desk and picks

up a piece of paper and says I have here

document from a gentleman a letter a

gentleman I believe you know reginald

Orfeo a lawyer of and she names the firm

that he works for I have it on good

authority that Decker on Oh is acting on

his own authority and not under any

auspice of prosper oh I'm sorry uh his

grace Lord of are so I believe that

there is still the opportunity to

embarrass him out of his current

position but it'll be a careful game

well if you want any help in that whole

embarrassment part I think I can speak

for the group confidently in saying that

we'd be happy to help you out with that

is this true

yes right who are we embarrassing just

remind me is Prospero and Lady shrew me

are they the two that get enough fight

like publicly all the time

no that's that's ladies Romi and the

Duke Marko Verona you know the you know

the as you bailed us out yeah yeah the

the the dude you've met works for this

guy you mr. Markey Markey Markey damasco

he works for House Brona lord of house

Verona and lady sure owe me constantly

like not constantly but it's they're

famous for like she refuses to see him

so he just waits for her to be going

from here their costs are in the Street

League and a huge [ __ ] fight and

there are reporters and they were they

regularly report on it because she has a

kind of a stranglehold on trade and he

is sworn to protect the ships that come

in and out mm-hmm they don't get along

yeah she wants to tell you come through

and he wants to like he he's kind of

trying to he's threat he's a no woman

and doesn't think that she should be in

business like it's fine to get rich but

you should not be a nobleman so it's

that classic nobles versus the Guild's

thing where she has a lot of power and

he regularly threatens

to stop got all he has to do is just not

do his job and suddenly there's gonna be

an age of piracy the likes of which

Gordon has never seen and and he's been

constantly threatening to do that and

she doesn't think he'll do it that's the

guy that guy was the tickets to the

Opera know that somebody works for him

these guys are working for us what's the

name of the pregnant lady who came and

talked to us as well as um was that lady

Minetti but was it do what judge would

notice if it was a slip the fact that

she called Prospero by his first name

like a almost like their familiar kind

of thing or is it more like a I was like

how she caught herself with that wasn't

more like an ocean like I shouldn't have

it was a mistake I do like an insight

maybe yeah I think it was Demelza pinned

on oh it was Demelza is the midnight is

the director of she's the my club senior

officer in charge I don't through the

[Music]

[Laughter]

Anna's routing what what was I supposed

to know what my roots yeah well yeah

you're you're you're sure that there was

some meaning there that these real and

these have crazy rioja Nobles who don't

get their authority from any real power

have why doesn't I know this room we

bought her nobility yeah that right

correct yes yeah if she literally bought

it yes she technically she bought the

rasps and the broadsheets

one too she loaned them the money they

eat it be able to buy in so she has a

lot of power

yeah but yeah you know that there was

some import there and the fact that she

used his first name and then caught

herself and said his grace Duke lro but

you don't know what it means and what's

her guards name okay his name is Sir da

da da de o dat oh yeah he's of the

here's the Knight Commander of the

Nights of this

damp but nobody calls them that they

call them my hammers that ham is it's a

better name all right

yeah hammers and the Dragons yeah the so

the other reason we're here is to you

know present ourselves to you show that

were being straight shooters with you

and with that last job you say shoot

ants what are we shooting where we

truthful dhikr oniy whatever his name is

but we do our job a lot better when we

have the details of the job and we can

be quieter if we know we're going in for

a document because you're trying to

establish a noble on the pellet but

going in without that information and

sending people like what you live with

doesn't know but it doesn't help us or

do our job to the best of our ability so

something to keep in mind for future

contracts I understand so you were yeah

okay we're also aware you've had other

territory taken by the church and the

knight Sir de datos like em well it's a

temporary something of a temporary

problem and ladyish only turns to you

and says i understand that you've

recently recovered an order of scouts

that were lost in black bottoms that

correct yes

thanks to your relationship with and she

turns to her night and she says is it

Duke and he goes no Marquis ah yes the

Marquis new mask oh yes and he delivered

unto you your own Scouts he did and how

would you characterize she says how

would you characterize your relationship

with the Marquis de mask oh he hasn't

done anything to slight us I say but we

don't really have a close relationship

with them other than he led us through

woods

yeah it's been a one-way street if he

showered us with gifts yes really

he's coordinates we may go to the Opera

but they haven't approached us with jobs

or contracts well it's interesting that

amicable I guess it's our relationship

with them I'm sure he'd be happy to hear

that you see it is the Marquis damasco

who is making it difficult for us to

solve this problem at the Citadel and

she turns to her Knight he says that

he's he's rather annoyingly reinforcing

the Church of st. Pilar the aspirants

troops on the or let's look better to

say perhaps that he's not stopping them

from reinforcing their troops making it

something about he doesn't say a sticky

wicket he says whatever the Rio of a

difficult bottle to uncork he says

[Laughter]

making it someone to probe for us to

maneuver you might say so I'd be uh let

me be best if we had a little low used

this to our veggies she says saengil it

speaking lady show me and she's already

writing a note have you met the Duke of

house Verona you're perhaps inadvertent

patron she uh we have not but I will be

giving a speech at their college ah I

see so the opportunity may present

itself and out of curiosity what will

your speech be on the history of war I

almost said for the company for the

chain would you be willing to take she

takes this piece of paper and folds it

up and she holds it up and she said

would you be willing to take a message

to a Duke Verona and this if you haven't

made it would be an excellent

opportunity if you did yourself sure she

gets some it's a lights a candle and get

some wax

and impresses a seal from our signet

ring into it commander upon delivery I

very much doubt it okay just open up in

the opens it up and he's like I suspect

that until now house Verona has been

keeping you somewhat at arm's length in

order to maintain plausible deniability

but I assure you if you're bearing a

message for me that he will see you and

it might be an interesting opportunity

for both of us

she said well if I see him I'll deliver

it she describes the district in capital

where their manor house is was there

anything we wanted to ask the commander

of the chain while he was here and her

knight says well sort of curious about

whether or not you'd be interested in

mucking in with us if it comes to taking

the city low back seeing as how you've

so recently come into a something with

surplus of troops what uh depending on

payment yes god yes horse mercenaries we

are interested in so you said that

twelve braggin z-- went there of their

own accord not under L borrows orders I

am not in a position to say I'm only

relying what I've what the message I

received from a lawyer hmm lawyers no

Fermi's I'm a lawyer either way I mean

we have a we could maybe talk to

Reginald

by now outside of this is very pissed at

us

let's see most unpleasant

what's that means hey tough you don't

well if I'll consider your offer if we

can come up with a methodology for

removing 12 Dragons from the pellet that

does not require us to go to war I think

that would be best for everyone involved

and you would do us the courtesy of

considering aiding sir Deodato and the

stamp with solving the problem of the

Citadel I'm sure we would be able to

meet your demand your fiduciary

requirements all right please deliver my

message to His grace Lord Verona if you

have any other business I think that's

it do we do we give it a contract we'll

give it I mean our contractors give it

to with with so he's going in yeah is

that we're talking about establishing

boots as the noble to give him claim

over the pellet we can get the Dragons

out of it without it going to work well

that was our suggestion was they we have

a Rioja Noble and were we're an

organization that can defend the pellet

versus who they would establish okay so

we're presenting it as such okay

traitors head yes or no about that okay

yeah I was just getting like a quick

like she's not she doesn't she doesn't

seem particularly interested in the

noble part that's between you and that's

between you and the heraldic Society

she's more interested in how do we get

how do we get the qualify guns off the

palate yeah like producing producing a

noble whoever that is isn't gonna do it

okay I'm really kind of curious you'd

mentioned where we talked a little bit

about like we need somebody to sit on

the princess throne who can help you

know

both sides in the city to prepare for

ajax its arrival who in your opinion

would you be willing to like fall in

with from a noble perspective you said

you're not interested in you yourself so

do you have anybody in mind who you feel

would be a good leader I liked the

prince do you do you have any leads on

who killed the prince uh or hasn't been

researched by your organization that's

something so I think it's well known she

says and turns to her Knight and he says

oh yes it's it was Sasson skilled which

one I and she's like I'm probably in a

broadsheet he's a guy yes but and they

have some kind of debate about which

Assassin's Guild took the contract and

they they list a couple different ones

and they don't seem you know they appear

not to remember which one was the one

that pulled the trigger so we're more

interested in who hired said guild vs.

guild you didn't she sais on her neck

goes back difficult that to get the nos

asin's guilt to reveal their to reveal

earlier their patron yeah but you being

behind themselves somewhat on keeping

that those things mom so to speak but

you being part of the council probably

knew who the princes enemies were oh

yeah is she on the Privy Council yeah

yeah she's one of those she's one of

them made that whole Coliseum to

themselves that's a bit so the Colosseum

is is a large structure that includes

all sorts of like not just Greek

buildings but offices and stuff like

that and there's a couple levels

underground so it's a big yeah it's a

big structure in law stuff the it's the

part in the middle where they have these

to have like gladiator combats and they

would have like they would flood it and

do naval like scale battles with navies

and stuff like that they do all sorts of

easy stuff

there and that part has fallen into

disuse but this the the building that

the Colosseum is built around is still

very active and used it's essentially

the it's the it's the city government

and they still do a lot of stuff even

though the prince is dead

she says she liked the prince she says

I'm I'm I lie and she names the leader

of the rasp and the leader of the

broadsheets and she says I'm quite fond

of them but unfortunately I don't think

either of them have it in them to lead

I'd say there's so much ah and over

their head already her Knight says I'll

do it she says Aria you guys should be

should we see if we can get in with the

broadsheets through her I can't make it

so we can do two advertisement for well

less so that we want to get in a

position where we can feed them stories

yeah when they're writing stories about

us we would rather than write stories

from our perspective versus the truth

you mean yes the real truth our truth

that's something like angel you guys

with I mean if you want to ask her to

set you up with a meeting with the head

of the broad she guilt should be happy

to do that for their their senior editor

yeah I didn't be amazing just to see the

broadsheets like this to the operation

we get a tour yeah she's happy to she's

happy to give you a letter you could

take to the senior editor on her behalf

as an introduction to the dragon board

yeah but she says you haven't asked my

advice even though many people do but if

I were you I would work very hard to

stay as neutral as possible okay

the princes seals a remarkable feat I

have no idea how you pulled it off but

for now you're on no one's side and if I

were you I would be very circumspect

regarding who I work for

and who I was seen with hmm spies

everywhere

[Laughter]

on that case we should get the [ __ ] out

of here yeah yeah well surely despised

everywhere someone's going here right we

can do I talked at the college guys oh

sorry cool we can because we just came

out of here all right do the college

thing right I guess if we already got to

talk at the college if we talk to the

principal hmm I mean there might be

spies there marquita Vespa we can't see

it anyway what is this what is the first

rule do you like me yes notion check no

we're doing this week immediately yeah

we came what's the first rule of

diplomacy no always blow everybody yeah

everybody

we've never been involved in any open

acts of war with anybody came I think

that's so I think actually this is a

pretty good job for us to take to try

and get the Dragons out without

insighting work is if we can keep

trading Madeline well we want to be

trading the line to the prince which is

why yeah yeah we want to be we want to

do that we're offering because they want

to clear them out and that's the

princess land so she's gonna think about

what you've said she's willing to talk

to lady Antonia she's asked you to

deliver let her to mark over owner yeah

and she's asked you to think about

helping them clear out the citadel which

would probably like a military operation

if we do the jig for onething then we

get seen we've been with the red Falcons

we've been with shoroma confer and that

means like we're seeing like I said

looks like we're talking to a lot of

people but if we did the sister thing

gonna be like oh look they're siding

with her right because they've gone to

kill out so we go yeah

things adverse so if we're taking jobs

for example to military operation if

we're sending muds unit biue done even

guy well I mean I think there's we would

be doing something but the open the open

stuff would be muds unit helping them

right she's she turns to she turns to

reliance isn't there something we could

do to here's oh certainly as we provide

you with our livery mmm we're there bees

you being a soldier you know it's very

very thinly veiled ruse he says but it's

enough it's not fer fer what was the

phrase you used and she says plausible

deniability

so yes right yes of course yes so you're

men who'd be fighting not under our

command but under our livery okay well

the chain of acheron need not be

involved us officially okay okay all

right

man sweet clothes everything is that

like even if we do get seen here at the

fulcrum word I mean you're about to go

and do a talk at the college which was

like literally like they're their enemy

basically and so that will help balance

the scale a little bit mm-hmm well in an

in a similar way the Knights of the

fulcrum need not be you'd not sell you

their name in helping end a grudge

between chain of Ekron and some Wang rod

Knights that have gone rogue

have they gone rogue yeah you should go

talk to Duke go talk to the 12 Dragons

borrow yeah we got a letter right that's

I don't give a [ __ ] and so that's why

I'm not gonna bother to try and learn it

[Laughter]

who is the 12th boss Varro we should go

talk to that guy I think we're gonna go

down that road we should probably talk

to Orfeo because that's our contact at

LRO and he's one who sent her letter

saying hey like these guys are not doing

like they're not going there on our

command like they're on their own

so now you'll talk to Orfeo and like woo

out like what's really going on dude

like is this lawyer speak or are they

actually write that probably just gives

alvaro possible deniability exactly

right well even if it was them who did

it they could say oh yeah we didn't tell

them this to do that that's like did you

not but you know probably just listen to

the whole conversation we had with her

quiet easy shakes her head and says no

we wards you like a massive wizard yeah

he's the he's the Chancellor of the

Royal College of sorcery the Imperial

College isms Vanna gar uh bodyguard

right she hang around - no she's she

doesn't need her bodyguard here in

office plus she's got she's got so dear

gone hurts well I think at this point we

can probably leave unless you guys have

anything else for what do you have

copper Massa give me more of this yeah

can I tie cookbooks like we have it

imported all the time we can give as

much as you need yeah whatever reason

it's normal or it's it's a little bigger

than most cats

bring your just your light bender I

think she calls okay Lightman

displacement yeah is he the last light

bender Celeste under she asks if she can

have some of your goblins well fine

no no it's not that's like the DPI hello

hi Here I am talking to a microphone

[Music]

what's going on in we got some fancy

schmancy themself into my game what is

going on here

[Laughter]

Oh Barry is so good yeah I'm enjoying I

look why don't you just make a berry

channel like should be so yeah these are

tiles from something I don't remember

what I think was a miniature wargaming

some [ __ ] I don't know that's cool I

bought these a million years ago

probably like 2006 maybe my kid before I

was born

yeah every day

what actually happens is you Jesus

parades us about liking Pokemon and

other

yeah that's true yeah

what does it and if you wonder what it's

like to work here it's 80% Lorenzen Anna

talking about Harry Potter or Pokemon

plaintiff Harry policies done how do

prescription you folks are thin uh the

Colin sold just district which is Tiger

map please

oh my Matt okay well that's sure the way

I need this stuff oh you know means a

common zoo is district right yeah it's

so clear really clear

this isn't blue can you see where I put

this arrow it's in the it's really clear

yeah it's a princess territory they're

yellow in yes right in this territory

who's read the bar is the priests yeah

Navarre House Navarre runs the churches

[Applause]

there are so many churches in capital

that every major faction and has some

churches okay but how's Navarre is like

he's basically the guy who we get the

magic testing for you probably before

wizard it would probably be somebody who

works for House alarm the Citadel it's a

it's a stronghold it's an old ruined

castle basically for keep that was once

used by the city in the states in this

days it's on one of its in the kind of

the corner you just see it on the map

it's it's the it's the it's one of the

dots on the map in stay away from it

yeah it's the one up in the upper of the

stays it's on the upper right well yeah

they're really clear though and it's

it's it's it's a large stone building

easily defensible it used to be

the military building or the cops used

it's just enjoy here I think that's what

we should be back wow that looks the

this looks way cooler on there than it

does here hmm I don't feel like I can

almost like it's easy it's almost easier

to navigate 3d evening yeah it's much

easier to navigate from there so this is

a very old district

unlike the stays the roads here are

often narrow they're very twisty and

winding the houses here are 2 or 3

storey houses and they are built up and

out so that the second or third floors

often are lost touching like neighbors

can open their windows and pass things

between there are larger courtyards and

stuff like that but you definitely feel

as though you've gone back in time

somewhat and that this is an older part

of capital and as you folks are making

your way down what is already asked

everybody this I asked what your

perception is what is who has the best

perception it was plus for its wisdom

yeah oh yeah you just didn't use read

your book

well that and I'm proficient in looking

at things well the perception skill I

took it as a yes it is a skill yes it's

only a seat just correct yeah sorry come

please

sorry yes I feel I have really rough in

a long week it's like Wednesday yeah in

this part of town very crowded probably

in terms of like population density not

much different than the stays it's just

that those roads are so much narrower

that you have all these people packed

into and you're not in the sonic Allah

way you're not in this day

you're not in the stays anymore so you

folks stand out something like a sore

thumb there are certainly no goblins

riding displacer beasts around here but

much like your experience in the blooms

at Blue Hill where when you went to zoom

at poles place sorry I screwed up once

and now I'm super paranoid when you

would to Sebastopol play the same kind

of thing except that's a very well-to-do

RIANZ this is much more middle class but

now you're mostly surrounded by people

who are ethnically real when there's no

goblins walking around there's no

drought walking around and so you get a

lot of people eyeballing there are

guards in the city and they all have the

same livery but they're different than

the red Falcons and as you are making

your way through and you're gonna cut

across and go over into house Verona's

territory you hear someone behind you

actually you guys can be facing this

direction that's mine and Odie I guess

does he is he is he tiny or sees what's

in a size smaller than that mini yeah so

he doesn't density does he take up a

five by five squares here tiny uh what's

this actual give his stats boys

I'm just kept being I'm I don't know why

I'm hyper focusing on we do say take a

square before do we okay yeah yes tiny

he is tiny so I think he probably

doesn't take up a square okay I think he

can size tiny essentially it's in your

shoulder oh yeah yeah probably his

favorite and what he is he's got the

parasol up it's daytime right yeah yeah

he would be set on me you hear someone

call out or scream like in pain and

agony and coming from that direction in

fact that's not coming from over here

just in broad daylight yeah sound like

someone shouting and then simultaneously

vomiting and then you hear screams all

the people over here start running and

you see what erupts now

get over there yeah - action yep Aaron

or we can just what Karen nyah or we

could just yeah we could forever

okay so King when you get over there

what you see is there are we rock comets

where does it go but we Charlie Sh

mm-hmm long I mean we're both least

together but yeah well just there's so

many yeah so lots of people are running

from this little tiny courtyard here but

then there are a couple people who are

like reaching down to a figure it looks

like a dragon board

right not a knight but Dragonborn

dressed as in regular Rio and outfit

who's on the ground and and like and

like heaving like his whole body is

racked and people are like what's wrong

you are and at and he sits up and

screams again and you hear this guttural

twisting sound come out of his body he's

a weird dragon his whole body twists his

skin and flesh rip apart and he just

gains mass like the Hulk and as his body

twists and rides and bones snap you see

horns erupt out of his head

you see wings sprout from his back and

his his scales which were you know

darkly complected become almost metallic

black and when he's when the

transformation is complete there was a

black dragon in front of you and it's

arts raging and attacking the people

around in a in a madness and I have no

idea how long we've been playing but I

need a break so you just try tying this

to around 8:30 so whatever this dragon

dude was it's that big yeah so stage 2

are we doing the the cigarette plant so

walk away banish it I'm kidding

that's true can Batman [ __ ] where this

is where it's from trash it back to

dragon land ragged line warps into an

apartment so we'll see you folks in

about 13 minutes thanks for hanging out

and bearing with the session such as it

has been so far but when we come back

there's probably be like initiative and

a growing stuff but hey we do my show

how you show that can you grab and bring

the letter - yeah yeah hey we're super

organized fetching some of the stuff

folks have sent us we are still pretty

overwhelmed by the fact that people

occasionally make fan art - based on the

nonsense we get up - so we are gonna

look at some of that now lares curates

all this stuff so information make sure

to contact him make sure he sees it

otherwise it doesn't end up yep what is

this that's a lady Antonia yeah that's

cool

like well there's another one stick

around I love this it's all it's all

awesome but it's really cool that was

done when we were done playing yeah yeah

I'm pretty sure that's that's what to me

that's that's what mud looks like yeah

yeah that's what she looks like when she

gets dressed up tonight talk to ya we

should look like that she doesn't wear

the traditional Agarn outfit unless

she's talking to another this is a

formal portrait yeah yeah Nick at some

point mr. Newman's we got this fantastic

letter which included instructions from

assist Jonathan Potter is his name great

moustache on Twitter and this is is this

the dude that does the sweet

and he sweat he sent us he made and 3d

printed in 3d printed three yeah and so

the reason the lights went out right

then was because these 3d printed arrows

have a little secret compartment inside

that you can put glow sticks in and

they're they're 3d printed such that

they're these runes on them that will

glow if they are shining properly I

think unfortunately they weren't we

activated yeah well we did it like an

hour kibosh yeah yeah and he printed

this great stand oh nice these dope

arrows but they come with a made glow

sticks and you put them in here and they

will glow from within which I thought

was pretty cool yeah so thank you great

moustache a great cosplay sorry we

killed off the character you just have

to grow mock and cosplay is

[Laughter]

yeah oh yeah let's see it's it was this

weird Monday I can misread the inner

spells I misread as well he's a good

character I don't think it's tonight the

next the next one this June the register

I really meant the lunar cycle

all rights like him

it's a king I thought you should know as

we're looking at this dragon here I saw

a dude robe dude it's running down the

street in case that sorry or anything

but did you you wanna go get him

what's no copper was tradition 18 Oh

slim 12 mates 22 damn King 17 leech I 21

[Music]

and Odie knowing okay judge I real the

13 so I have 15 total

cores yours king 17 yes I think 12 so

you boots see this black dragon there

are it's about as tall as the houses all

right so I know that houses are all you

know 2d so it's hard to tell and there

are the people who were trying to help

this guy are now desperately trying to

get away understandably so yeah and it

seems this black dragon yes pretty much

as you see it seems enraged hmm mad or

angry topper do you wanna go get that

guy can I see him still baby make up

perception check 15 yeah but he is just

as you're looking like you've reported

what you saw it and boot says can you

still see how many yeah he turns round a

corner dang that's like two more tiles

away from you but you know which way he

went

yeah that's hoping I could hunter

Markham but okay can't see him well we

can maybe you track him after the fight

yeah we know it well you ain't got it

mm-hmm

I don't think it's worth splitting offer

no no this is what happens in our combat

sims against the black dragon oh yeah

yeah yeah a long time ago but we need to

not be all bunched up where it is yep

like we all right yeah yeah yeah

all right we should also be aware

casting spells in public might be a

problem here might give us a pass maybe

but let's you know yeah discretion is

the better part of valor does it yeah

that's good like a good moment pretty

good I might say like stuff like

hasting slim you know that's not a well

it's on there is no city guards within

sight there we go yeah yeah I mean there

weren't any there weren't any in this in

this one intersection come tell us the

way there's not cops everywhere

all right I'm going to I'm gonna shout

at the I'm gonna shout at this dragon

and cast Bane sort of shout some random

insulting things about how you know this

scales are too shiny or something

so Christmas a charisma 15 all right and

then in that case I'm gonna give mr.

slim mmm inspiration go get him champ

and I'm also gonna damn it dance

backwards yeah that is boots leach mmm

leach boots just said something very

encouraging to slim and then we thought

did a tactical yeah all right something

to the dragon which didn't seem to work

so you got this pat pat on the shoulder

and then in a cloud of death yeah

tactical retrograde now maybe yeah good

thirty forty eight forty five yeah I got

it

what a casting blight is like oh no is

leach do and leach cast some light it's

like some weird thing that like drains

their vitality yeah what it does to the

to the creature yeah so what does okay

sure yeah yeah yeah what does it look

like when each casts I think he would

his eyes would row actually yeah all

right some reason the eyes would roll

back and he would kind of give it her

reach like reach out yeah like tried

trying it on you say the the black

dragons body shudder and its muscles

ripple and it just it it is obviously

wounded as resilience it becomes

slightly desiccated and that just makes

it really angry angry at it's gonna try

and like draw it out into the open I

mean do we want to try and draw it out

in the open

wouldn't hurt I wouldn't mind doing a

spiked growth right here cuz then you

have to walk through all of it and fly

over it all we could fly of course

dragon its dragons turn I know that

looks like it right oh boy

you yeah it's better than being

unconscious that's true that's true that

is true let's see

and as I pick him out my kind of I just

quietly say to him

to apologize

I rough its offer and big got some

feathers right you can get ugly

only on the ground well yes he hasn't

gone up yet though

I guess not earning it see it up before

I got slim up when we fought the bow

deck he just wrecked the bow decks who

still is what's your ability to say does

it actually say that you get to pick him

up

what's football as a reaction where a

light drops a conscious you gain a free

movement you must move towards the uke

it was a slow turn that's way out up oh

it was still his turn you're right if

you end your movement adjacent to them

they may spend a hit die yeah mmm let me

think about it might be silly me see you

zoom in on his turn to your Raya your

might when slim went down it was still

his turn I got him up and Lenny rake the

program here at the boat dock yeah brah

I guess you still pictured said that's

all right adil hunter's mark and then

attack 2011 plus 11 22 it's easy to I do

yeah it's it's our class's 19 okay

thanks mm-hmm so I do 15 damage for the

first day 15 damage again 17 plus 11

that hits 612 damage and then I'll move

big big cat leaps forward CNSE who

master has showing no fear be cat has no

awareness of how much larger this

creature is than it is oh you know I'm

gonna do I never used this I'm gonna do

a fury of the small is this creature

larger than me yes okay

yes I mean in my mind he's not but so if

the creature is larger than me which I

assume he is he'd just be happy that

he's like oh yeah like two inches away

from really close yeah I do an

additional six damage

oh no seven damage for it's based on my

level

it is a pro attack no just once it's

just I just do it think it's a goblin

thing so I just do it and it's gone some

things yeah yeah what you twit should

think about nothing

and then big cat attack yeah

oh this could be oh no I'm gonna stand

hey do you not have to be touching him

to do this I have 10 feet reach also

serve him just give the 10 subs to the

community preponderance of gifted sucks

is amazing anise 7 plus sickness is okay

the black dragons tail just got this

barbed tail which you can see it whips

around in a tax big okay mmm those dice

mmm what have we done

it's all right he'll displayed some

dodging that's right I think you missed

AC 14 he's 13 but let's see once again

oh really

oh but he's he displaced isn't there

don't have to say banished overall more

time and then yeah uh my next role is

much better so with disadvantaged I

think I you okay so that is fifteen

points of damage

okay how many did you roll it really

nice okay so you get two points of

ferocity okay I really should when he

went

because the stuff I've came up with for

display sir beasts using their ferocity

is pretty cool I think of course I would

think that I wouldn't made it up

otherwise imagine saying semi made-up

kind of sucks

well sometimes sometimes things need

work and I'm aware that anyway so is

that that was that was big cat being

Don's king all right well I guess we

need to cast spells on this - we're

[ __ ] up so down into the alley now

he's out you know but people that people

are getting killed so what is this is

this like cover back here what's going

on here that is a look that is a yeah

it's just a street that goes up to a

door you can't just can't see the door

so we haven't I mean is this like is

this a wall right yeah it's a Google

turn around and I'm going to now

Dragonborn - you've never seen one do it

well the little wizard guy did something

so yeah it was a guy a little fella see

[Music]

so I'm gonna shoot fire bolt this guy DC

who's gonna fireball this dude yep

fireball up here behind his face snap

boom yeah I'll use my channel to visit

that's great all the people living is it

gonna light houses on fire

nah no I'm doing it maybe but you know

okay Craig what's your DC DC 15 I'm

gonna channel the pin idiot so

makes it what he makes it you just roll

the one right up I was riding roller

damage

you know I channeled the vintage so it

takes half 48 he takes half of 48

yeah it's 24 yep I'm gonna go in this

little nook here oh yeah that's a good

spot like this is the Battle of the

street and so the huge fireball erupts

of wha the fire washes over the black

dragon you can see it's singed but once

the fire evaporates the dragon is still

resplendent in its dark finery he's a

dragon he's gonna be probably at

resistance or something but creatures

with legendary resistances can just

decide to make a saving that you just

did on my fireballs

mana let's mitigate me that it's judge

all right

so judge thinks it's like really

peculiar he's not know like he's never

seen board do this class that before so

he thinks there's definitely something

going on here sue wants to try old

school that's old school

in the 70s an ad and an illusionist

which was a different thing from

magic-user net access of different

spells they could make a black dragon

show up and for all intents and purposes

it looked and bhaved and did the things

that black dragon did and the only not

the only but one of the ways you could

fight it is just decide I don't believe

that that's real and you made a roll and

that's I rolled to disbelief and if you

roll well your character didn't believe

that there was a thing there and

sometimes there was sometimes a delusion

it's like what it's adorable you don't

do this in

but there is but yeah if it was an

illusion then it would for you we go

away right so anyway so you doing pretty

she doesn't believe that you cast some

spell yeah we Casper I'm not has to

spell magic so I take all the bad things

Laura said about thanks all right so

it's one action with 120 feet I'm

definitely close enough so I choose one

creature object or magical effect within

range any spell of third level or lower

on the target ends for each spell of

fourth level or higher on the target I

make an ability check using my spell

casting ability which is charisma the DC

equals 10 plus the spells level so on a

successful check the spell ends alright

okay

okay so I can roll okay I mean 13 you

watch so judge where are you moving or

used to nothing right here you see a

mood so judge calls upon the power of

Asmodeus actually it's the way you cast

spells is just your arcane knowledge and

and casts dispel magic on the dragon and

you watch as the dragon reconstitutes

itself at bones snap skin Flay's turns

inside out and kind of like the house

from poltergeist rock and there's a now

naked because his clothes are all ripped

up dragon man that falls unconscious on

[Laughter]

so yeah yes that's uh so see you guys

next week get a naked mini

that's so cool you can probably get out

now boot yeah well I'll give him the

cure wins he comes to and he's like who

are you where are my clothes I I'll give

him my cape

he says thank you just cover him so he

knew the dragon boys little time yeah

he's like he carries it really confused

and you're uh you're obviously a nice

respectable Rio and gentling yes I hated

my cape and I says long I say we're

weird the chain of Acheron we're Knights

of the Prince you were just a dragon

[Music]

doesn't understand what you're talking

about

he's like somebody who took someone took

my clothes but I read so I'll [ __ ]

like acid it up yeah I mean yes

occurrence for you but you just turned

into a three-story tall black dragon and

started kind of you like pushes your way

and it rejects what you're saying look

at us look at us we're covered in what

you've done

[Music]

[Laughter]

we're soaking in it anyway we don't

think this is your fault

Oh running yeah he pulls her book around

him and he says I must get to the church

ah which is like what uh what everyone

would say in Louisville so this yeah

this guy doesn't know what the [ __ ] just

happened I think he was just wasting

valuable time really unlucky target of

the other thing covered on the way there

so actually our Dragonborn like are they

even hearing capital are they still kind

of like bounty hunting no okay I mean

it's patan no that's a it's a purely Vaz

Lorien thing that's that specifically

people in Baz Lauria trying to some kind

of anti Dragonborn agenda going on here

perhaps his name is Karaca kerosene okay

[Laughter]

[Music]

I mean I didn't spend hit dice but we'd

have to do is break I don't think we

want to do a rest yes okay uh due to d8

+ or fill and I guess um did say things

you got 28 plus work yeah I didn't get

to roll on the recharged I to see if it

let's see what would happen what do you

recharge does his breath weapon

no you wouldn't you wouldn't be by and

sure that's not a yes you would have

been fine so bolt the rolling from the

screen that's true mr. winds doesn't

matter I rolled in front notice that you

hear a what now not entirely unlike the

sound that people on that alleyway made

when that dude turned into a black

dragon you hear dozens of people

screaming coming thank back to where the

dragon was like down here somewhere off

the map how much health did you uh I'll

be fine okay figure it out yeah y'all

get we gotta go stop that guy before we

gotta get more [ __ ] giant dragon so

pick up and you see if I pick up his

tracks

oh yeah well you know which way you went

yeah oh yeah but you saw around the

corner it's good yeah all right well

let's go come on over

I've got my mood cat boots so I can't

keep up oh yeah yeah I don't know if you

as fast as a spasm you know we tell the

dragon is there only yeah I can run I

can run as fast as big cat so I'm like

just top with a displacement beast

we told the dragon man the guy who did

this to you ran that way it was only

after him he's still kind of trying to

rebuild his reality he's safe friend get

to it somewhere where you know just you

know where he can't be Casilla like he

stops and colds the cloak around me was

thank you what the chain of Akron saved

you we didn't ever even do the spot we

saved your ass yeah yeah correct yeah we

didn't even have to use any spells

yes carries around little standards that

we just throw it down so Robert and

boots let's so we're gonna use the same

the same Road intersection thing except

you guys are now let's reverse it yeah

you guys are basically coming from this

direction in two years so could put

copper and Boots over here actually put

copper in boots like I would say here

here here here and we can basically find

room this way so let's go mean bring

needs better okay I'm gonna leave dead

prove it Mason quiet you think that's

what you deserve

the time the parasol Nadja parasol is it

daylight it is mm-hmm

you're in the alleyway oh let me light

it is daylight and Dragons podcast evac

uses spell in it so [ __ ] you too come

upon a horrific sight there was a crowd

of people here these are the streets are

crowded but most of this is already over

but you can see there's still two or

three people it's one if I can actually

draw on its is this I think it's treated

so like going out to here all of this

area all this area so this whole space

and you're like right at the edge of it

there are people here who whose bodies

are dissolving into a giant red furry

mold and as and much of it is already

complete but there are some who are

calling out and screaming reaching out

they'll reach out to you to try to grab

you as you watch their bodies they're

like their organs and

skin turn into liquid turn red and then

become part of this huge mat of russet

mold that is growing now throughout the

city and writhing and reaching up the

walls and out toward you and there are

people that the people here and people

there screaming and you know clutching

trying to grab loved ones who were just

turned into a giant mold and it's

initiative yeah and you notice look a

figure he has ensnaring strike and

people are pointing saying he was hit

with him and he's kind of pushing them

away and it's this figure is it's hard

to be precise without some you know

objective frame of reference but appears

to be about ten feet tall ten feet tall

almost twice as tall as a person no

lodac wearing at wearing a clothes

wearing it wearing a cloak head to foot

you see his face right no copper and

boots can make a perception check 16 16

is pretty good come on was that your

perception about perception you notice a

glint of metal flashes as he pulls the

cloak around him someone tries to grab

him and stop him any Yanks the cloak

away and gets a splash of no silver or

gold it's hard to know symbols or

anything I don't see mm-hmm I likes a

higher level clockwork Oh like a the

next level of him find out who's at him

right there yeah yeah that's the boat it

is also the boat after yes it's to bow

decks

funny heads back for revenge Kornegay -

uh this is the enough dab oak not a bow

down is very very different

Wow boots what your initiative 25 that's

a good initiative yeah leach what's your

district 13 it'd be neat if it was less

than boots but not much less 13 black

dragons is no now of interest only to

historians copper and big happening to

22 Thank You King 1880 was your thirteen

that saying yep thirteen judge seven yay

slim 1313 is the same as leach that

right excellent sleep state now yours

okay and then OD is now he's dead

currently visiting his infernal master

yeah story I guess it's yeah it's your

drow mr. Stein yep it is right so now I

need to check the stats they know and

see the folks of a Satyam stats I worked

I'm very much you may have noticed I'm

very much a off kilter all night tonight

it's been a rough week but the folks at

MCD instead we have I actually have

known Lee any of us know who the folks

at MC diem stats but they do a fantastic

work if you're still watching at this

point I recommend you follow them on

Twitter but also we have an amazing wiki

that folks maintain and update all the

time it's a great and also I think you

folks watching right now probably know

this but I believe it's Carrie P who

does a recap writes very useful to me

when I'm doing the campaign diary

that'll probably up tonight if past

behavior is any indication I may have

just put Carrie P on the spot I

apologize if so but it's a really

remarkable remarkable job of writing up

everything that happened in the stream

tonight I'm gonna be really short about

my new play golf me know what you doing

D&D what are you doing their day and

I've started reading the campaign oh

yeah there's a scroll and I

a story

oh yeah only our bedrooms master

apartments that best of the badges right

so let's see this I died there's twice

as much this guy's running we need to

get the in yeah I feel like yeah if we

get him we get that kind of like that

right um good jump

oh I can fly see the problem with a lot

of this stuff is that I have to use an

action to get it on me and I could but

then you're down around I guess right

but then yeah then I'm down in action we

don't know if this guy is gonna be as

scary either I'm gonna haste you so you

can get up there and start you can stop

him yes you have strength but wait yes -

guys you have to go through it's like an

artist joy he's gonna get an extra

movement he's very left to touch creepy

right supplies gel so if I remember

correctly carry Pete will update taking

a point to message people who jump into

chat late and go what happened oh yeah I

go well here's here's what has been

written so far which is pretty

remarkable yeah that's cool that's good

value for money - yeah yeah exclamation

point recap right cool I did not know

that does dope I'm not a star mods are

the best we're at some yeah yeah oh [ __ ]

together and come up with stuff we can

reward patrons with like pins and stuff

well in hand we'll make sure that our

mods get a bunch of that stuff I will um

one thing would tell us-- my actions

still a small company so anyway boots

boots there's a there is about it looks

like about 30 dear 30 people have been

dissolved into a giant russet mold here

in the city and the mold is now crawling

across the streets and climbing up the

walls I'm gonna take a cue from from

judge and try and dispel it okay

so that's 17 versus 10 plus the spell

level unfortunately nothing happens what

the FAK don't wear sorry everybody and

manner I'm going to the problem is that

I mean yeah judge I mean boots is

knowledge of the arcane that grants you

access to those spells what when the

spoon was a great idea but when the

spell fails you think yeah because that

dragon was still a thing just turn into

another thing but now there's no way to

disassociate the soup of people who have

turned into this giant russet mole so I

mutter a little word of confidence to

myself and then and then you eat my way

across 40 40 so yeah I can get right up

there alright I need you to make a

constitution say the new flavor of Go

juice it's a great group that's sixteen

sixteen okay you're fine you've your

boots are your the moon cats boots are

covered in this russet mold that's got

it looks like the kind of gross furry

mold that grows over food except it's

deep red hmm

and now can I see your character say

please now you are mold how many spells

per day can you cast a spell caster work

for you

flip it over hello what was the section

labeled spell casting I see the one so

you have three more spell slots correct

wait you have

huh oh you have a fourth level spell

slot a third long spell slot awesome

fantastic great the moledo a deport that

is a d4 correct - yeah okay you've lost

two feet at four what's the range on

that yeah okay one two three

it's copper four five six it's slim four

five six copper could you do me a favor

and make a saving throw

okay wisdom save the DC is 15 wisdom Oh

fifteen exact you just used you tried to

be so cool there put that mark up is

broken you as you as you approach this

figure a you or the the it takes a lot

of practice and study in order to master

spells and so when the act of preparing

them is the act of kind of having them

all always at the forefront of your mind

right so that you can uh no man's notice

recall the spell that's what you're

doing when you're preparing your spell

is you're studying your spell book or

recalling your training and just over

and over again at and almost like that

when you're at a wedding and somebody

says if anybody has a reason to stop

this and you're like they feel the

sudden compulsion to just speak out but

you don't but in this case you can't

resist it and you do this the your crown

of madness spell

it just suddenly comes into your mind

and you are unable to control yourself

or stop yourself and and you you

inadvertently try to cast it on copper

wait crown of madness yeah

second level spill thank you very much

[ __ ] you tried to cheat okay yeah okay

seem like you're old well but I guess

you still all right uh yes okay it's a

copper big cat okay yeah oh I'll try and

snaring strike see that'll rudiment

place next feature hits well plus 11 22

that hits

what are you attacking oh sorry I'm

attacking this guy attacking him yeah

the DOE have a standby dodecahedron

there you go Yeah right I think we

should beat him um he's not to be a

saver anyway it's a total this next

party does I'm doing experience and

snare and strike strength check take if

he fails he gets in snared what's the DC

on the strength 12 so what's this is a

this is a saving throw right yeah

against us yes to make a strength check

right well yeah 17 okay so nothing

happens literally nothing happened yeah

doesn't even go off you folks see copper

shoot a spell arrow and it dissolves

before it can reach whatever that figure

is okay so I'm just gonna go and

evaporates right

before I hit some if I still do eight

damage oh there it is

okay so that's my first day so it that

was it's like it it's an addition to

lead okay fair enough

Wow and then 22 that's the one that hits

between yep four nine image magic you

climb the building hmm maybe I'll do

that that's copper big house King I mean

I can take my turn looks pretty easy

okay paste to slim down the shoulder

okay go get a big boy I go back to my

home second commander ability can I can

I move it all you can choose to move or

you can so senior officer of the chain

they may move their speed gain of free

melee attack all right we're gaining a

free melee attack you don't get both oh

I don't get bullish you're not get both

shoot well in that case since a trap has

gifted for more subs it's a trap it's a

trap who made the 3d printed oh grown up

there

has gifted a total of 235 sobs Wow

blimey yeah that's a lot it is it's a

ridiculous amount thank you oh jeez it's

a trap so slim you get plus two AC your

speed is doubled you have advantage on

deck saves and you get one extra action

you one attack 1-1 dog or disengage or

hide if you get one action but it's only

those things yes but also your speed is

doubled right now the nineteen plus

eight hits are attacking this thing yes

all right so it takes oh if I can get

there can't you jump I know you're back

there on yeah well it takes for your own

is it 30

yeah oh thank you Reagan

it takes 20 ones damage 21:21 damage

yeah you'd be like one away 21

take a couple of turns you could use

your extra movement from the haste

mm-hmm and that's actually that's one

movement a so you can use it extra

movement of the haste and then you could

actually take your attack as normal and

if you wanted to action surge you could

just gives me another action it doesn't

give me a move and yeah correct but your

haste gives you another movement so it

doubles your speed and you can choose

you can do three movements yes at least

you'll only have to do two because right

now your speeds doubled

if I'm reading this right it's nice to

be doubled so just so oh then jump a 60

we'll put you here 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 then

you can use the haste movement to get

around over here and then you still have

your attack and then you can action

search if you want we're learning don't

get up so you attack the robed figure

and for you yes stabbing it weird rapier

mhm and it spins around and you catch a

glimpse of its face under the hood and

actually is there a picture of this

there might be but so this this person

this figure towers over you yeah

[Music]

I imagine I was stabbing its knees join

him out oh nice nice camera squirrel I

can't believe you wrote on the back of

that yes some night I'm gonna make I

gotta make it said literally literally

skin starts to change into this green

leathery substance and he erupts out of

his outfit your boots are destroyed

big cat takes three more diets of damage

getting three more ferocity okay and it

takes 15 points of blushing damage as a

pseudopod of the rest of mold strikes

that go ahead and make a constitution

say seven seven okay big cat there's a

patch of russet mold left on big cats

shoulder

[Music]

big cats Constitution goes down by Jim

whoa what well at acting like that

big cat Paco flew by the mold was so

worried about Bogart shame black-rimmed

he's doesn't he does he's he's an he's

an incoherent blob of his swamp thing

basically you have a haste use the haste

of movement so I got to run so it's

gonna be it's gonna be leeches turnip

come on Zach exactly spunk on I see why

not people just a little bit not a dead

people I think they still alive right

catch up a bit I'm gonna try climbing

little trash Jerry get going it might my

new Dodge testicle cinnamon [ __ ] I'm

gonna zap this mold but I'm at this

advice tank it is sunny right oh yeah

absolutely

I'm at this is but I believe your

sensitivity is if either you or your

target yep even if you have parasol its

two wooden yeah yeah correct the

parasols just I like it I like it to

draw parasol that's not to like my

lowest one it's a 5 plus 6 11 yeah 11

hits 11 says they see incredibly easy to

hit it's a giant it's like a city block

sized russet no that's my lies so that's

16 so I have here we go the russet mold

by the way it starts climbing over this

house

growing and then damage is just another

day in capital life in the big city life

in the big city 10 plus 3 is 13 13 with

1 and then 5 plus 8

sorry focus 3 is 8 so 21 damage total 21

damage total to their mold mm-hmm see my

best sunlight what are you talking with

oh yes yes you're agonizing ly buffed

builders plants yeah so you watch as

leach just fires his what's the what was

the description that I gave it because

it's a celestial so it's like holy gold

yes like golden radiant golden energy

yeah right you know it's interesting

that's interesting

[Music]

slim huh did the mode react okay yeah

you can see every time you every time

you strike it you burn away mole and it

stays burned away but it slowly starts

to kind of crawl back to fill the gap

left so there's a couple of spots one

for each agonizing blast of bare

cobblestone oh but not long enough to

hold Riven with them well you can run

run through the agonizing blast of in

there how did it did it make like a path

for you no I didn't make a path that

just made a couple of patches too old to

- owls he that has an idea that was too

too old for candles so so how far wide

how far across is the the mold it's 6:35

that's the crow of molds well Sam has

jump I do but I'll have to use an action

to cast it hurted yeah

enable it it's weird the Sun of bonus

action

yeah it's not your hasted I still get in

action

that's true I got an extra action are

you gonna but only in it there's a list

of what you can do with it

yeah it's me it's yes but you can only

do one attack is basically what it is

sorry I'm your level five you don't get

to attacks from it can you use it to get

an attack one attack yeah not an attack

action okay yeah extra action one attack

call Matt - comment disengage comma hide

those are the only three things attack

disengage hide any other one four things

what was the fourth one - so an extra -

disengage

okay what are you talking about welcome

to being welcome to being a permanent

jamming man so is the shambling mound is

it'll attack me though yeah it's a it's

a it's it's correct it doesn't know it's

boots it doesn't know it was boots I

just run through it well let's see here

I mean I'll have to make a saving throw

right oh you can jump on the [ __ ]

remember you've got you've got the

inspiration die don't forget about that

no I know

height is although how inspiring is a

shambling round height is not like crazy

as they keep doing [ __ ] like this so

unless we can get over there like we'll

take care of boots and whatever the [ __ ]

this is you need to go [ __ ] that guy's

day up alright just know that I'm like

about half of my hit points fifty little

less the more damage from that [ __ ]

yeah black right [ __ ] I mean I I can get

there and like you know but I mean I've

got badass sleuth artists dude like

you're such a good artist with thanks if

if I get there I mean I'm not gonna last

that long by myself it's all I'm saying

yeah you could turn you into a thing -

yeah right but if we let them keep got a

whole [ __ ] it

alright yeah yeah do the chain of

background not the chain of let's sit

around

just just I don't want to take any

opportunity attacks from [ __ ] not there

so can I can i sorry I could hop over

here and go I can't tell if that's

something I can just walk over or

thoughts or crates there Oh crates yeah

I mean you could just land on them it's

not gonna how long's your jump it's you

would have to make an acrobatics check

to land on this elbow my speed or double

my strength so 36 so third if you want

to land it might get a 10 if I get zip

you go from here uh-huh

one two three four five six wait I

thought you said it was 35 across in a

minute hang on how it's so it's double

your strength your strength is what 18

18 so it's 36 mm right

so that's 34 how many 36 that's seven

ski is it seven squares

yeah seven have to get a run okay so I'm

about to ruin your day huh that is not

in addition to your move

what do you mean I mean you have a

certain amount of movement uh-huh and

you can you can you can jump some of it

just how much of it you can jump it

doesn't give you extra movements yeah

he's Haitian right now so he has double

movement okay so cute right now so Ochoa

is a point of jump in then jump over

stuff like this idgit jump over this

give you half of my turn I'm like

hovering in the air yeah I think that's

technically I was [ __ ] stupid well it

but that's the thing is it the haste

gives you after movement the moon cats

busca but jump is just a thing anybody

can do it doesn't give you extra

movement it's just a way to get it's a

way to use your movement mm-hmm so yes I

know jump like spill it's not downer

it's just stupid I mean like well

[ __ ] for how long does it take to

jump something in a to disappointing

mechanics rules today that's rude yeah

well you got a hundred twenty feet of

movement so you just [ __ ] okay so me

as far as was gonna say was if you start

jumping here you go 5 10 15 20 how high

is that this is 20 feet up I don't know

if I can get that high Oh is there a let

me tell how you can get well it's it's

you know there's yes make sense

yeah when you cast the jump spell it

just triggers this

wait targets jump distance is tripled

until the spell and these squares at the

edge are 10 feet be square it doesn't

matter though because I'm gonna be

hovering in the air and then you land

[Music]

I'm alive clearly crazies [ __ ]

well if you want I don't know if this is

possible but if I'm just saying you

could land if you have the height you

can land on Earth you don't have to yeah

I don't think I can jump that well if

someone so tell me what he's until Dutch

way he's about to do he's like you know

judge help me like cover this distance

like judge has message magic missile and

I feel like judge should be able to like

blast a few squares that way you can run

further and then like I can part to see

a little red sea and then you can cut it

jump and land without with I think I'm

just gonna run through it okay that this

jump spell irritates me and I just don't

want yes [ __ ] it I'm just like you know

what [ __ ] you I'm taking my ball on I'm

going home make stupid rules yeah

Rosberg a so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

mm-hmm and then let's see you could do -

that's 11 oh I can misty step as a bonus

action I don't I don't need to I just

need to be the target why don't you just

miss you step over here then how far 30

feet 30 feet yep so basically what I'm

saying is if I can get farther than far

enough up I can misty step in front of

them oh yeah and then I'll action surge

oh okay well you can get - I believe it

was here with your 12 mm-hmm so bad and

the misty stuff - uh I don't think

that's 30 feet - misty step I'll count

it out yeah was right here six would be

30 feet that'd be right behind them yeah

I mean well actually well [ __ ] you can't

see though right well I know where he

went

I'll be able to see once I get up there

well are you able to use your action

search to grapple no wait action search

maybe so 12 will get you here

uh-huh and then you're gonna miss you

step in front of them which is six I

think I might need to share him you

always have to be able to all right you

don't know as you can tell you can

teleport

maybe maybe mister step well see further

[Music]

space that you can see yeah yeah so you

can get behind him all right let's do

that I'll take my [ __ ] chances yeah

I'm gonna have to walk through the walk

through the Rosenwald so if you have a

constitution say Constitution say okay

why I can use this only if I need to

yeah you can you can roll a d20 first

and then decide if it looking low I got

a 22 yeah you're fine so healthy yeah so

constitute vigor

okay so then I'm misty step past sham

blur and I don't got worried about him

yeah all right yes and grandest her slim

used to be alright so who confused I

take my action seal up your attack oh

alright you still have your accent

search if you want that mm-hmm and you

didn't use the haste thing because you

missed you stepped right

do you have five if I yeah yes five

attacks yes well if he action service

yeah

to see what happened to Musa I think you

were I thought happen

come on that's you guys just watched

boots lieutenant boots turn into a

[ __ ] I need to marry a dragon that's

big cat feel promotion nice three armor

class definitely okay I am going to use

a security die I'm gonna do distracting

strike on him so that's [ __ ] sorry no

it's nothing

tonight it's okay we not a resolve mate

don't worry so 18 damage you therapy on

that attack

I get advantage on this next attack

because of the distracting strikes cool

it's 23 again it's okay

today's episode will it blend that's

gonna Sloan's new nickname is blender

yes what you call him saw [ __ ] yeah Cory

the players handbook page 182 every foot

you clear on your jump cost your foot

just like oh I mean it makes sense it's

like no doesn't mean every time yeah

exactly

you would move your movement your

strength oh you know what I couldn't

have done that distracting strike oh it

has to be that the person the next

person who next attack other than other

than you with you I would have hit

anyway but just you know

we'll just do make sure being honest

that's cool so you done then no no no I

just no I'm just trying to think of who

I used that superiority diet

I took the damage but I guess didn't

work I didn't do any special effect

unless he wants not will do menacing

attack make him to make a wisdom saving

throughout DC 15 is this magic no no

it's just this is scary [ __ ] Oh

what's the D season

[Music]

I used my legendary action 14 more

damage okay so that's that's nice right

number that's mine okay so that was my

first and I am gonna do my action surge

and then you have your one attack from

the east all right action surge okay 16

plus 8 is 24

oh you're older than like about 15 which

is like miraculous all that nice okay so

there's 23 points of damage and make a

saving throw be 215 wisdom saving from

wisdom saving folks

alright next tact

what a wank you'd be way I think it's 26

[Music]

[ __ ] I know cats are nasty one

well you have a certain class of smells

you ever seen the council spell he's a

dope back it's just like this I'm gonna

use another superior I'm just [ __ ]

like Blitzen on this guy oh so this is

only you know you can't kill this thing

just possible 20 damage what do you say

like that okay just because I don't just

I don't you hasn't get discouraged it's

not gonna die after all this huh yeah

yeah he's gonna [ __ ] kill me

turn him into sewing all right this is

it so this is my last attack this is the

haste attack I feel like if you're slim

and you hit with all these attacks like

you should knock this guy down or some

[ __ ]

oh yeah I just sit there you can't just

sit there and whether or greatsword

slamming into you for [ __ ] six

attacks and 80 damage I'd be like right

now and cut his head off

I wish yeah I suppose not hoping for but

dude that's draw my god that would be

amazing if you crit this to 19 but see

don't ya 819 is his armor class holy

crap alright another superior today

because after me

judge oh this is definitely something to

show like how yeah this is like metal

things I can't sprint out you know yeah

that's all I can it's the nature a

miserable this is how we should have

been with the try this one I'm gonna do

distracting strike the next person that

his advantage that's right people

hopefully have people in the street

forgotten 16 more damaged 16 more damage

well if you can dispel boots boots

that's all I got

oh I do hope you're staring into a fate

expressionless like loose approximation

of a face so slim roots and you clothes

can't see this but you give like a

battle prowess which is very poetic and

makes it look because you've got these

long lanky arms and then you spin this

sword around it looks like it weighs

much less than it actually does because

of the way when you slam into this guy

hitting him over and over and over again

disintegrates and there's silver blood

bleeding in all of the ass you're

fighting an angel

wait he's blue that's not actually the

pellets yeah so yeah it's as wings never

roll and it speaks to you what languages

do you speak

I speak a common gift and infernal yeah

it's none of those

but you don't know you just told me but

it it shouts at you in some language

that you've never heard before it has

solid gold skin and it's it's just

wearing like now that the robe is gone

it's just wearing like a loincloth it's

otherwise it's naked looks about 10 feet

tall good your TV that thing I wanted to

be heard David or they call those things

like angel things

it's that wings yeah

yeah Simona make an RKO check the gif

have been all over it's true but my

archanis it's a true off it's a it's a

Sun elf it's dark called soul are

Celestials they are the creatures and

any kind of creatures exist it's a

[Music]

[ __ ] [ __ ] you can't see this but it

is the same category of being that was

that was this episode brought to you by

[Music]

[Music]

as long as you cast the spell

unfortunately your clothes anymore

because he gave it to the summer to

shoes is counting the treasure and wait

sweet sweet sweet you're saying slimmer

like you're gonna slam your leech he's

got a 20 dude 20 mm thicker snap I just

did for that yeah it was a Sun elf yeah

it's a solar solar celestial also known

as the Sun L know the true L to I

exclaim it when I see it yeah yeah it

could be like yeah yeah you hear slim

call out but I don't know if that means

anything to your characters but it might

need a role to know yeah can we just you

know what you're gonna fight Ditka Ronny

yeah I think leach knows what it is man

yeah yes so leach could tell you you

know they're they're greater powers

they're like gods they're why only if

you do right I don't speak snitch I can

understand it patron talks to you this

is me you just interpret

od try to subdue it I said oh man you

it's it's your patron that you're

calling on when you summon your imp yeah

but it's the matron of your house that

is interfering with your signal yeah and

and making us so the ODA shows up yep

every time not your that's not your

patron your patrons like okay go ahead

have yourself a follower and yeah yeah

fairy dragon

probably or something like that so II

know I said oh nothing nice like me and

he's nice and cool and he's in Hell

right now or the abyss I don't rember

which is it still judge are you done

judge good job actually as soon as I

turn from a pile of moss and mushrooms

back a bit back into a nude booted man

brief you'll not remember being up I'm

not showing up I'm just kind of like

cold skin what I was looking around and

like I can actually see slim yeah so I'm

going to behind him a nude boots arrives

what is that as far as you can go

no he's actually you know what I have a

plan

boots plan a PLM I'm gonna try to tumble

past this guy Wow tumble naked tumbling

tell me about this like two hours ago

they're like what can you tumble bro

come the way this works is I'm making

acrobatics check against I believe is an

optional rule in damn Scott isn't there

like a middle gear solid like game that

has this sequence in it probably

optional okay that's alright cuz I don't

think it's really weird

much more I got stuck in this big room

and my dudes [ __ ] running around

naked I'm like I have no ideas cover his

junk

dumb that's why I'm like this you

probably would have got mad like ten

minutes further too because it gets

really [ __ ] weird there's a point

where it like comes up and it says the

mission failed thing but you're still

going around cesspit

yeah it's like the whenever Metal Gear

Solid just kind of like went all three

three was a lot of fun and it was pretty

mostly normal after that it's just like

are you looking at something I just

wanted to make sure that I got it right

well the stream the stream won't let you

know if you get it wrong I mean go ahead

and just make an acrobatic Jack I can I

don't need a [ __ ] rule I can just

make up a some nonsense i 1919 is more

than enough yeah so what you're able to

do is be able to move through the space

without provoking attack of rapture yeah

oh no you get behind him yeah yeah I

still get behind him and you have

advantage because slim did distracting

attack anyways but now you got advantage

advantage general level events oh no no

it's nothing yeah I'm just gonna I'm

gonna attack Superman this thing does

have a large like larger than normal

great sort mmm oh well I'm still a [ __ ]

yeah is it on fire like that one no

question about us but I mean as big as I

am isn't it

take him out man take him out i soften

him up for you alright nineteen it's

heads is our class oh oh yeah we know do

we know if that was something else sorry

it goes when the worst of all goes he

takes uh 19 piercing damage my AC goes

up to 20 I hate to do this to you boots

yeah

my assembly mound again correct me if

I'm wrong that's not a magic weapon it's

not a magic weapon how much damage did

you say you did how

how much damage did you say you did Wow

Wow Wow I'm ugly burned out starting to

get punchy he's starting a punchy shoot

I miss that's just a 7 plus 8 15 even

with advantage yeah

bugga eNOS don't make your role better

[Music]

and I'm gonna well no not because that

would be I'd probably die junior I mean

I'm gonna try transit leader arrow

translator so I feel like it just shoots

an arrow and I just go to that spot yep

as long as it's in range I'm gonna go up

here at that top of a roof well that's

gonna take a roll because you can't see

that okay like you could shoot you could

show you where you are you and you could

shoot this base hit the wall and then

that's me but if you want to shoot this

you'd have to kind of you'll land

somewhere up in epilogue it's just you

not gonna know exactly where this fall

gonna be like a little bit of it

depending on a few if you hit if you if

you the DC that is probably automatic

like you're basically shooting up in the

air and guessing but that disappears

yeah I don't know where it landed coop

and then you show up where it went okay

and so your role is did I did I land my

arrow where I want to even though I

couldn't see where I would shoot it and

if you fail then you're still gonna end

up up there it's just gonna be there's

gonna be a deviation die I see which

direction did I miss by okay so it's up

to you you can do it over here you

cannot attack Oh on the roof nobody's

gonna put you in a [ __ ] chimney

[Music]

is the chimney there what wait where do

you want to be and what do you want to

do when you're done like where do I end

up where you want to be yeah I mean I'll

just I could I could Evi enough shoot

there but I just be kind of fun to go on

a roof whatever reason it doesn't do

anything I don't even know if I could

see my house on the roof yeah okay so I

320 feet she's there you go Wow well

that's a disadvantage but 80 so you

watch copper pull out one of the five

arrows that zoom at pole gave him well

done and what was the head on this one

do you remember yes brass brass is a

brass head and it's and the arrow sticks

into the wall and as soon as e'er it's

vlog conference experience I'm just

three words all right you're out yeah

pick it up I mean okay sure you grab

your okay but I'm your family grab did

[Music]

you trying to decide whether you have to

use its interactive or just deciding

what rule what action it was but it's

gonna be interacted with an object which

you can do as part of your movement okay

with my other attack got any other

special area you want to use I mean the

fireballer yeah but I'm gonna kill

everyone but I was thinking of all of

ice and just like right here I'm just

making a blue like raise them up cuz

we're gonna do anything so just be kind

of sealing in the middle of the aerial

smashing he's mad he's made out of stone

right no okay I was doing a hunter's

mark on him and then

no wait yeah I have enough to do that I

might have missed 7 plus 11

that's 18 he's 19 okay is a season 19

all right yeah oh yeah yeah

can I try climbing this building I

thought he already did no I was the

right at the front of it yeah because

I'm uh no problem um so is 20 feet you

said yeah he said so that's 20 and then

five making its way oh nice that was

copper big cat its king you can't see

what's going on down here

there's no way I can get over there so

true I can't not all the way but like

Cyril neither is that of it no I have

one two three four five six I'd live in

it why should you double speed I could

do that leave right before it we can

figure it out mm-hmm I'll be all right

yeah let's disengage it's like I think

you use your well I think we gotta kill

this thing though still to consume the

square elder now yeah we need to kill

that guy for worried about ilayya

killing how might kill that yeah that's

true he also might be able to fix it if

we him I don't know if we need to kill

him I don't know she trained to it all

right well over here you've ever had

this gate works it's been so long it's

an action that converts your regular

movement and a movement that doesn't

provoke a taxable okay so that movement

so yeah I just gotta move through this

to make the concept good main concept

give yourself yeah I think that's an

action pray dear the garden God

[Music]

I don't make it so I got goop on me yeah

you were Constitution goes down by two

yeah what sure what what you are what

level are you sons level you lose is

that my dream about 8:14 hit points

oh one what's your Constitution 14 it's

all right well sir I was so 7 correct

you're right you lose 70 points I don't

know why I said i reversed I really

nervous the player yeah cuz your bonus

to your head points yep okay and you

don't feel well you don't feel you feel

a bit queasy only a little rusty you

feel sick if you like you got the flu

are you this so that's your that's it

that's it yeah you know okay

the mold the mold starts climbing over

this this building and you will see that

like this corner of the building starts

to collapse like it's being eaten away

by the mold and this could be the end of

the city this whole thing is just mad at

his mom I remember when there was a city

called Capitol

I think it's digested and then it's just

a chime old okay so slim there are other

worlds

so soul our celestial mmm-hmm

makes it a gesture and this and summons

a swarm of insects I know I need is it

five ten fifteen twenty I need slim and

boots to make Constitution says this is

magic yeah it is

yes the darkness magics no more heat

it's not super good not the best 25 25

oh my god

and they also that was this this

creature

the mold is eating the building it's

[ __ ] [ __ ] if it keeps talking me

slim I can't say to it like speak a

language we can understand so I did move

and I cast a spell that's it yep

actually what do you like you healthy

okay uh yeah I have the disease but

nothing TV they they are the ones that

hurt I didn't get hit by that dragon

Lutz isn't a bad way many a point you

light I think it's that far yeah we

didn't anticipate fighting a black

dragon and then a gargantuan russet mold

and a planet are rough day for the

change

I think it's nothing is 560 speed

healing light it's you're an excellent

yeah your next six deep Fae yeah he's 60

10 squares away okay that's a feeling

lies a bonus section yeah I'll give you

some help in me old China I could do

three of these per throw I think so you

get back [ __ ] four five six

I mean I'll take it okay my tabs now

annotations my I just realized tab some

and her computer

you know why cuz she ran out of tabs on

a computer yeah I hear people watching

don't know about Anna and some people

talk about it I'm gonna do not the

computer tabs have we doesn't this ain't

Twitter

still no because in her AC it says for

temp it does they update it it's been

there

oh you're Anna's page on the wiki talks

about 13 damage

because I want the extra damage on this

alright but y'all as as slim does more

and more damage to it the silver blood

that the wounds start blowing hmm oh

he's regenerating the wounds don't seem

to be closing it's gonna be just it

would be glowing there's light streaming

out of them oh you're a skeptic coming

yeah what we've done to it this geezer

well I think you just laid in 450 for

poison damage

well that upset man he didn't attack you

guys we might a dragon but not not need

to turn you into a dragon [ __ ] you're

right maybe we should just left it 16

more damage look out I have it and judge

if you manage to the next person who

attacks them gets advantage yeah I don't

yeah it might end up being boots but

yeah I think it would because

I'm that hand by judge could I see your

character sheet why I'm not even near

the red mold not your night King can I

see your gaijin I'm as far away the

judges yeah but you're not no I judges I

know it's we mean this is are you

talking about judge is where the

premiere of the red mole know what's all

have to do with this you want give me

your hair she came I almost have the

real one that's what those slippies turn

I got no it's a reaction okay

legendary reactant a leg bend a parry

speak some words we can all understand

schmoopy - Ashley you look at the second

little spells you probably much chatter

slim I need you to make a saving foe

okay vs. or yeah it's Christmas Eve is a

magic it is magic definitely save yeah

so that would be 21 - okay do you wanna

you are not banished to the astral plane

okay as soon as you took oh you see King

those are you who can see King yeah he

kind of has this spasm is his body

doesn't obey his command and he speaks

and he's just kind of wildly looking

around and this magic erupts out of him

the banishment spell finds its way to

his lips points at slim but Slim's

connection to the mundane world is too

great that's the only thing that I've

rolled like super high or slim liking in

this world yeah

so that was king correct no sorry I'm

right

so judge is gonna be cool if you were

here because you've got some dope spells

ever just tell me how great banishment

was you just turn around well I don't

what's the range cuz you're like pretty

far away but you're within line of sight

so as long as I'm not lookin - sighs

this is also bugs in front of copper we

got her remember it doesn't affect me oh

wait that was slim Stern 30 hey I got a

look at you need to make another save

slim okay you're still in the insect

like one here this one was Constitution

yeah this one is whopping 13 you take 14

points of damage from insects okay Cho

char you were asking uh I was asking you

can I go here it's my own within line of

sight or not you are not in line aside

of the solar sauce was very fussy slim

you oh yeah he's pretty [ __ ] up okay

how did you get over there

I double moved I'd make a constitution

saying don't roll the snake one it's not

doing your right to that good recharge

recharge this will be there those are

the ones I was rolling yesterday you

know met yet od text column except for

one see if you could

make the right choice often Constitution

let's take some damage and lose some

constitution I don't wanna

we need an app nineteen plus six

you're not molded twenty five family

ones if you resist the mold infection

the ringworm does not affect you that

was judge are you done um yeah I think I

am gonna use that my invoke authority

though cool what does that do hey mister

channel divinity in both authority

Bernal Arcanist

until the end of your next turn you can

cast spells that normally have a casting

time of one action as a bonus action

until the end of your next turn yep does

that mean you can do it right now yeah

nobody actually so maybe I should use it

for the next time yeah actually I'm

gonna wait till my last until the end of

next time mm-hmm so if I invoke it at

the beginning of my turn then it will

last me like that turn in the next one

okay let's do that

kidneys what does if I push a creature

yes it does it work like in rubber alley

where it will push it does yeah this

whole game is built on Robo view you

forgot to shoot the laser if you yeah if

you push it will it push flame is what

you're asking yes probably all right

Yolo

alright 12 plus 8 is 20 are you trying

to do any magic isn't being pushed

opposed to action thing doing a spell or

some [ __ ]

I have a spell of some [ __ ] this is a

mobile flourish expand and roll one

Bartok inspiration die to deal extra

damage to the target you hit equal to

the roll and push the target up to five

feet away from you plus three feet

because of the number that you roll

don't die so five plus three I don't

know how you wanna deal with that

grant round it down to zero I would

round up round up to five the nearest

the nearest five for the increment all

right so that pushed him temp is weird

yeah and then um did you do damage to

him yes I did

so uh yeah 18 okay

eighteen damage and then nine and then

I'm gonna climb up on his roof cuz

you're all [ __ ] up because I'm all

[ __ ] up and Gaddy and say stuff well

the insects stuff actually it's a

20-foot radius just over here so 5 10 15

20 s so it's gonna if I'm not gonna be

looking at one it's how much movement is

it to get up on the roof well uh for

there it's 10 V 2 1 alright so that's 10

15 20 yeah now you're kind of climbing a

bill Eric let me don't know 25 30

if you move here you're at a 10 SEC like

what if I jump down here next to judge

well then you're fine all right

I do that dosnt done a naked eats drops

from the sky haha

naked in covered and I get a second

attack so I'm just I'm gonna yeah I'm

gonna pull a knife that I met through

throw it at him you betrayed us

and that's what was 820

[Music]

this would be funny business what kills

him super close but no nine damage monk

that was boots copper don't you baby

gonna come a big drop this [ __ ]

do we wanna know oh I'm [ __ ] kill

he's really powerful I don't know

he could just make us cast spells yeah

okay I talked to him he's just gonna

bandings yeah I can suggest that he not

suggest all you want not screaming at us

in his in his infernal gibberish his

celestial gibberish [ __ ] man I wish I

understood you like ask your list you

[ __ ] pantry - like - I can't

intervene opportunity no you're likely

probably worth them you know like Elric

is calls on Arioch all the time like

blood and souls from ontario yeah it's

crazy to me that there was like been a

game of thrones whole the Game of

Thrones thing know Elric stuff yeah they

were like there was a movie script yeah

it just seems like when we were growing

up our work was evergreen honestly we

could always buy all three books yeah

another sort of quasi different yeah

i've been written for the original on

ebay that's the only place you go yeah

like the actually the fix-ups which is

what we read we were kids there they

don't make those anymore they literally

don't make those books anymore when they

do Elric printings that what they do is

they go back and print the original

short stories but what we read was him

taking those short stories and rewriting

them to turn them into books huh

so like was Elric always like kind of a

moody [ __ ] like he was in the books we

read if you read it like if you go

kindle and download Elric the first the

first what they call the first Oliver's

book he's a lot more Conan like when you

first meet him he becomes melancholy it

becomes melancholy after everything goes

to [ __ ] so when you meet him he's a lot

more like the first thing he does is he

walks into an inn and

and grab someone's Eiland downs and

talks to a bunch of barbarians and it's

cool it's neat like especially if you

know like where he's gonna go he's not

this it's a start with him losing the

throne try a brooding boob um so if I

have this fireball arrow in a fire can

can I shoot it and you were like if I

were to say you didn't like back here

yeah then it explodes and you just have

to ten okay and if you and the fireballs

gonna go off but if I miss an AC of ten

probably not possible thinking your

armor is your bonus like unless I roll

one or something yeah so if you can't

roll one in Krita a miss and that just

means it's gonna scatter they're gonna

go off but where because it's gonna go

off from you know one d8 and it goes in

a certain direction again catch all

those buildings on fire well it's art

there are to be eaten by the rest of all

we can just blame it on this guy yeah

we're going to the cops with this guy

afterward why if I can disintegrators

off its territory 22 hit the floor

so you see you see copper take out the

the what's the tip on the arrow on the

that one is software on the sulfur

tipped arrow and shoot the sulfur tipped

arrow and strikes as soon as it sparks

off the cobblestones there's a

detonation of fire engulfs the soul our

celestial so eight descendants by the

way that's that's the title of tonight's

episode what the Sun health yaaaah

Sawyer we're not still looking at the

spoilers well what's Twitter some people

more that's right yeah was riff boy at

night [ __ ] ie6 is yeah that's true -

you need to - more indie success he's

ready I don't want him to like that kind

of

10 15 8 oh that's easy enough and there

give me 45 24.7 whatever pass that to

Phil don't read that you have no ok so

proper shoots this yeah

shoots this arrow that fireball explodes

wreaths the Sun elf inflamed

you see his wounds start to open more

more and more light starts to pour out

of his body the blasts kind of throws

him forward he puts a hand on you and

you hear a voice in your mind as it has

telepathy

yeah and it looks into your into your

gift your astral plane eyes with his

they have solid silver eyes and then the

wounds that you mostly you created tear

open and the light inside him escapes

blinding you

copper judge boots King everybody except

big cat and then uh you hear people

screaming this by the way that's been

non-stop this entire time people running

and shouting and you're all blind the

blindness lasts about 30 seconds - blank

furiously and when you're done blinking

is gone there's no body there's a just

the cloak he left behind over there any

sword no you can see the silver blood

like mercury that he left and you can

see like footprints do I have any idea

what the [ __ ] this is all about I don't

know do you have any idea what the [ __ ]

off like I don't think slim knows any

more than bill does

so whatever conclusions Phil would draw

or I'd only they could tell the rest of

class you know where to go

yeah I think I would at some point I

don't mean you guys the the Russert old

still has to be dealt with

mm-hmm but it's now that you guys are in

combat and also guards show up mmm get

out of guards have on their shield is a

stylized scroll like a parchment scroll

with writing on it there the word is the

name of the guards the prince has got

the night the Knights of this district

mm-hmm that are there like this

districts versions of the right balance

now that you guys now that you guys are

out of combat you're able to take care

of the Russert molds and kill it but the

people that had consumed or dead much of

that building has been eaten by the rest

of all and that's where we're going to

leave things unless slim wants to tell

everybody what here well√∂ can put it

around boots his shoulders he's still

naked the shredder yeah I'll pick up

what remains of this guy's clothes all

your all your out your all your clothes

are still fine they're not okay well you

can get dressed when you shower you
