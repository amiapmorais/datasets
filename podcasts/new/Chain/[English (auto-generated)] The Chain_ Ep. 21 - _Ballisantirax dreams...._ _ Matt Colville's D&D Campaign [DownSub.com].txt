wounded Lowen spells the chain of Akron

face their greatest foes Ajax's strike

team in capital the black iron pact but

the chain are not without tricks of

their own allies accumulated over 10

years adventuring across the time scape

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

you

it's initiative hello I'm not [ __ ]

around the time for [ __ ] around is

over that's not good start fine I

disagree

is that yours yeah that's late I don't

want to hear about my rolling anymore

drop dead right now love how bad we are

rolling guys oh my god Rose applause

yeah nine last better all the 400k oh we

got caught flat-footed got any more

that's okay two left

listen yeah

sometimes with the windshield sometimes

you're the bug that's good for you go

mmm

I could have rolled all these guys

initiative ahead of time but I wanted

some of the drama wants a little action

will die action on my own so I did I did

enough work on these [ __ ] already

why me

that's an early one and a combined yeah

it's an early blood less it would've

been funny if there was one lone bad guy

I've done enough work on this [ __ ]

I got a switch to another [ __ ] yeah

way that was it to practice wrong but

yeah first role don't you guys have some

[ __ ] ability that lets you decide

who goes when you lieutenant or some

[ __ ] they don't have anything like that

do I

so you say I'm what you do at the start

is you roll all your D 20s and then you

pick the one that rolled well I'm gonna

use my lieutenant ability to switch my

initiative wit with whoever among them

pulls the highest

not that guy it's all ones well they got

at least one really we've got three huh

oh yeah

where'd you get garbage I rolled a three

that's four

would you get I carry before or go ahead

and place your guys around the crystal

where you was here the 508 you're a nine

a nine Peralta I can I can put your guys

where I think you are

so where do they gone oh sure we're nice

guys were within 10 feet of the crystal

right yeah that's right we were looking

at put me and just in the front is this

the door like looking at it I think we

were all sort of looking at yeah yeah

yeah me in the back cat was looking at

the hole - yeah yeah when last we left

our heroes only out party would have

exactly Dani chain of Akron had found

the giant diamond I mean that once held

a soul or celestial acai on the back of

who was powering the wards that kept

this place locked down that elf is free

the wards have failed and as a result

normal mortal beings like the chain of

Akron are able to get in here mortal

then they heard voices coming from a

distance and teleporting in was any team

the black iron packed alright you're the

quarterback so these folks plump up

plump up college you can't use Walter

yeah well it was for like half a

campaign

[Laughter]

I think I got the picture wrong Minnie

stand by one so that's the five that's

the cleric that's the monk I think

that's the wizard that's the teef a

thief the assassin teeth that is the

night looking person okay one two so I'm

missing one I am no actually it took two

minis for the same dude so I'm down one

I'm down I'm down another heavily

armored melee dude which should be

relatively easy to because it's

important that we be able to communicate

about all these things even though

there's no real way for you guys to know

this this guy is the warlord right

warlord assassin wizard elder tonight

monk priest okay okay I kind of mean I

can only kind of see how over here well

keep in mind we don't like we could move

that boring I didn't see where your dots

were so it's this guy is the older

tonight yeah this guy is the warlord

this guy here is the priest they got to

me this guy is the monk obviously this

girl is the wizard and she is the

assassin gotcha and as you can tell I'm

like unlike you folks they're all human

and the first thing happens once they

teleport in is the the monk the master

of jackals howls and his guys all get

either an attack action or a movement

and the warlord the warlord says kill

the Hegar and priest first

no resurrections and so that way left

wait do they get to move through us like

that yep

this is their free position of the

positional this is where they're gonna

be once initiative starts yeah yeah

that's his that's his billing ability

she's happy where she is

you say there's a wizard or a sorcerer

this is a wizard

I mean I'm using that's that's the term

I used to refer to them what's that what

are those for

so Phil can see the [ __ ] colors no no

I just I couldn't see the dot that where

Matt was pointing yeah when I was naming

I couldn't find your box that's the monk

all right I think I think they're done

so now it's initiative copper what's

your mission

why didn't do anything not as far as you

know okay nine sort curious as to how I

think that's kind of in the middle of

this one judge seven boots nine who has

a higher law tax of the two of you from

20 meet you who has the better hint of

the two you native one

0o smarter than boots king 17 look at

that beating yon slim thanks yeah

judge was yours 577 Lord I'm faster than

slim the chain of we all act next turn

Odie uh 12 well what aboot so copper

have 9 9 12 and leach 4 4 which is

always relative oh wow ok deep breath

so King is 17 you say yep

Wow and that's not great that's good so

this is a I apologize in advance if I

get if I get overloaded runnings gonna

be running an entire party is a huge

mental tax on me so these two guys both

go and then it looks like it's what did

you say got leech 4 full yet and judge

you and slim got like a seven and a six

okay so I think it's gonna be like that

alright so the first thing that happens

is as they get into position the wizard

sees you folks and says mercenaries and

casts Obama Tori Spelling spits on the

ground and her saliva is she spits turns

into copper and a copper bounces and she

goes that's what you're worth dang huh

Wow

I don't want to pick up usually I mean I

think coppers worth a lot yeah I miss

brain talking the most valuable yeah so

copper the warlord attacks you okay and

he what is this warlord dude look like I

should probably try to try to be at

least a halfway decent DM and describe

they're all humans they're all from

different parts of the world the warlord

is a ryokan very heavyset

muscular reality and heavy armor and he

he is he moves into position like a it

moves like a cat not entirely unlike

boots and he has a big fuck-off great

sword and he's going to make three

attacks against the Goblin which are a

glass of coffee 18 that's pretty [ __ ]

good for ya

[Music]

he hits 3 times 2 to 10 cm stats I roll

this is not this performances to twelves

on a 90 so you take 2 for 66 + 15 Shh

yike this is just regular great so this

is regular damage 18 18 18 15 33 take 33

points of damage and you have

disadvantage on any attacks that don't

include this warlord he is oh it's like

target he's he's using his great sword

and his fighting ability to if you try

to target anybody else he's gonna he's

gonna take advantage of that he's gonna

throw himself between you and whoever

you're aiming at and you can still

attack other people it's just you're

gonna have disadvantage as you try to

aim around the dude sure that was the

warlord and then king what was your

initiative 17 what's your what's your

Dex

it's not behind ya it's a 13 and then

the monk goes and monk is fighting leech

this is the master of jackals this guy

is a cat Marin he's a looks like he's

got bronze skin it's got bald head and

he's got demonic jackals tattooed across

his shoulders mm-hmm the chains ask

content says the chain didn't realize

that they had stumbled into the water

temple is that uh what does that a

reference to the water temple assume

water temple is always the hardest one

is it so I thought it was a reference to

the princes the apocalypse but it sounds

more like though yeah so this guy gets

five attacks

yeah he's broken broken yeah they're

like yeah plus he so he also has these

black iron bands on his forearms

otherwise he's naked wearing like a

leather a leather kilt basically a

letter a leather apron breaths little

ice doing any spell stuff on me spell no

no well he's doing the spell is casting

a spell of punching fist hit your Lance

yeah exactly

fine I rolled a six and eighteen

thirteen Inman 18 what's your class uh

six thing okay so that's three hits and

a thirteen that's four heads for a 5 hit

yeah nice and in it yep definitely that

would and so that's for d8 where is an

eight-sided I haven't got one is fine

for faster on me

ten fifteen pre take thirty points of

damage

ah get out all right Oh so because

you've hit Berea three or more times and

one round by the master of jackals you

lose you're proficient somewhat as your

disorient

so it's probably oh god that's all man

days that's probably - three basically

and you can't concentrate on spells hey

listen you guys can do crazy [ __ ] they

can do crazy [ __ ]

it's your perficient's modifiers plus 3s

plus three it you're zapping if you're

zapping and something like that it's

gonna be gonna be minus three off

whatever you know if normal bonuses okay

that's too much math it's been it's good

thing you're playing this game and not

first or second or third edition or

fourth edition okay

yeah you look somebody from Jenkins to

go I told Matt earlier I was gonna point

to myself and these guys probably aren't

super wise well you could probably guess

which ones are wiser which ones I miss

orient yeah I guess the monk and the

cleric yeah reasonable conclusion some

of them could be very unwise indeed uh

then I'm gonna cast a cold person so hat

a level three which lets me cast it on

both of them they need to make a DC 15

with save the cloak boy and the elder

tonight the cloak around in orange night

the thief in the mail tonight okay I

know it's like cloak make that cloak boy

look boy an elf in my way yeah I love

that they're comic all right the elders

night and the assassin

[Music]

the elder tonight rolled a 19 the

assassin rolled a five okay so the

elders night is not held about the

assassin is held and that's a spell

correct correct

all right so that spell goes off and you

do your thing but the monk was standing

over here here here's you praying to Aki

meet su and as soon as your prayer

finishes he looks over and he does this

and you feel from across the room you

feel this hand squeezing at your throat

go ahead Nick wisdom save we're probably

make that [ __ ] no yeah back to roll that

dice you find yourself unable to speak

and the the master of jackals says says

the chain of Acheron but he says it with

kings boys well [ __ ] you get the saving

is that

everyone okay at the end of my turn yeah

the end of my turn yeah well no this is

the turn it happened

Oh at the end of each turn at the end of

each turn actually it's it last so it

doesn't haven't done anything yet so

yeah he doesn't there's been there's

been literally no effect yet so I have

to wait until the end of your next turn

right so his spell didn't work

no I spelled was off it's about it's it

doesn't interrupt see but it does steal

now this cat has no yet a cast old

person at level three on the assassin

and this guy got this guy and didn't get

that guy good it got the assassin can

you not get the does hitting them knock

it out of old hitting him yes they got

hitting him yeah and then I'll have the

concentration whatever thing okay the

thing that we always have to remember

out of you oh wait

and why oh uh and I pull out my staff

Lonnie what step is that huh what staff

is that my staff that is this a staff of

command the make the doors open on the

song name to every staff yeah yeah does

that do something cool yep oh cool good

to neveress the Final Fantasy Summit

just like crashes through the ceiling

you don't remember writing all right

well these off Thanks now the wizard

gets to yell okay yeah let's see he's

hauling a bat right yep initiatives

turns out to have been a huge deciding

factor in this battle hmm where's all

right we're good fine I wrote down the

page numbers of these things I am SM RT

slow I need you to make this a me though

okay

the save is a wisdom save [ __ ] off 20

sorry well anything okay you are not

dominated oh oh oh thank goodness for

that

yeah so just I mean yeah that would have

meant that this wizard would get to

control with slim dots and I completely

like go ahead and take your action surge

against nice sights yeah they're higher

level in you guys which is [ __ ] I

think it's popping it's a complete

[ __ ] Thank You Dark Soul

that's the spirit

[Music]

Thank You Jerry so now it's the eldritch

night the good news is 1 2 3 4 of them

are almost just and and all of you are

still alive

the eldritch can nigut who really wants

to kill this [ __ ] what can he do

oh [ __ ] I forgot I'm sorry he is here

he's guarding the door he's 10 feet away

from you he has helped and oh and II can

propose [ __ ]

[Music]

he will just attack you with us halberd

just time what's wrong with asking 21

quest noise that's a higher easier than

any of these guys have dad you get a

good the note I rolled up my module I

rolled a 1 an 8 and a 17 watch the 17s

you take they're not gonna kill you this

round a monk you take 10 for 10 15

points of damage and you are not proud

you can you can put your mini crown or

do what you want to be bro I'm just

gonna remember that it's brown okay

because I don't want the Cape to break

alright so the monk has done his villain

action is I think the only one and now

it's Odie puttin just puttin me on the

whoever attacked me a monk was it yeah

but when I know hopefully for when

you're getting up well yeah that's why I

said hopefully copper

okay um oh I'll use my nimble escape as

my bonus action so I could get on this

abandoned without your you're trying to

get away from the warlord guy yeah all

right stand by

alright so he has a reaction to you

trying to move huh what's wrong with

class again 18 it's pretty good 50% you

were not able to move your knife bro

even though I used this power it's a

reaction debt anyone adjacent him trying

to move away

[Music]

well you just use half your movement to

stand up so I think you can still do

what you want to do as long as he

doesn't move it ends this movement yeah

you take five points of damage

[Music]

yeah I'm gonna do my standard

variability in all senior officers

within 30 feet can hear I'm gain

temporary hip points equal in my level

so everyone gets a seven seven a

temporary when you're psyched a pretty

was as long as it lasts

it just it just means that when you take

damage those hip points go away first

yeah got it

it's they stack on top your normal

points yeah you say yeah and then I will

get up and I won't move

Oh bigoted people was that your action

was that was my accent yeah right okay

so I use my half my moving to get back

up but you said that ends and then I'll

tackle big cat I'll take him wait 10/10

oh yeah big cat has new abilities by the

way but big cats taking no damage and

has no ferocity so can I use big cats an

abilities yet I assume at twelve does it

hit more Lord no no these guys know

these guys have twelve bonus action I

used the wizard says is this the best

the Sapphire sky has I have forgot to

when he used his vuvuzela you didn't

roll your concepts as it actually is the

brown note I didn't hear if he had his

blue sailor I don't know why I don't

know why he doesn't have moves you

fought didn't you Bible yeah that's too

silly wearing a hat yeah you're gone

we're gonna top hat

the warlord says we'll we'll send the

Sapphire sky their heads when we're done

was that copper's big captain

do something cool boots look we try

you're not shoes your boots yeah sandals

you know your boots yeah

no more shoes and socks I only bought

resembles is a three take a break all

right I'm gonna attack the I forget

Claire Claire is it Larry attack the

cleric Z theme yes no Xena Claire feels

wrong you know we erected [ __ ] no I'm

gonna attack him again yeah it's more

like it okay so that's a 21-2 hit I'm

gonna use a mobile strike so I'm gonna

I'm gonna slash had him ferociously in

it pushing away from me oh no I

is that spell just not that you push him

away from you yeah that's cool so he is

so he takes 11 plus he takes 19 points

of damage right okay rust forces him 10

feet back so yeah cool and then I am

going to a flip-flop can be used as an

improvised throwing up and says in verse

or yeah under on isn't there word for

that here

oh I had advantage Oh

Oh and as a let's see is a bonus action

because you you took a pretty stout hit

there right wait see give me another

seven backside Twenty twenty three times

yeah huh I'm gonna hit points I know I

mean I don't have my dime my strong

you're hurt yeah dramatically

dramatically how does that ability work

what do we see when you when you when

you attack me list cuz fill mister oh

just like a just this like whirling like

thrust that hits him so hard that he

gets pushed back against the wall huh

yeah and then anything bad happened to

him well he took just 19 parts of

average man why I make it real hard for

me to get to good job we'll deal with

him when he gets back over here they

said you know there's a [ __ ] about um

he's get he did my do

he did get next to the warlord which

means you're now a five-foot step from

flanking warlord oh yeah it's true we're

all like yeah I really want to get the

priest though sneakers nests now we have

free casting casters in the back yeah uh

3 d 4 + fo for you healing healing word

nice yeah been a lot of games we get a

driver between I mean copperheads

healing doesn't comprehend you have

those yeah you guys have leech has

healing King King has healing when he

can talk oh yes yeah don't let someone

so much smaller than you push him around

that's my healing word well that's a Oh

a secret message within the guild that

was boots all right

judge judge you're one of the heavy

hitters in this group I hope you're not

looking at Twitter

um so I'm gonna go ahead and cast think

I'm gonna get burning halo in the cast

burning halo that's my action uh

actually I'm gonna do can you run me how

the steel thing works now for getting

disadvantaged like is it is it that big

no because I mean the I'm in the Google

Doc I also posted it and he's on to it

another thing

well when every post although she on

Twitter no no didn't I didn't I I posted

in the chain chat welcome to DMD in 2019

yeah where we have to imagine the kanima

so if 50 max your spells of the casting

time of one action convinced I'm just

gonna read all the stop another whereas

if it level your spells will be casting

diamond one action can be cast as a

bonus action against creature willing

your seals on them okay so you put a

seal on somebody in the next turn I can

and get the benefit well I mean

immediately says they have a see let me

get a benefit but you can't do to both

sections a single round can you know you

only get one bonus action at seventh

level enemies with your seals on them

have disadvantage to saving throws

against spells and you have to invoke a

seal on that brush I used to be your

scion of Asmodeus thing now that's just

the type of it what's a bonus of the

time you also have invoke authority

spell master as a reaction to an allies

bailing a saving throw or instincts make

it win I can make him succeed yeah like

like yes so remember that because

there's gonna probably be a lot of chain

of Ekron failing saving throws by

knowing that once yeah you can do that a

number of times

it's your invoke authority ability and I

think you can do that I thought invoke

authority was price per day if you

changed it so it's whatever it says no

rigor doc alright so we've got the

elders mate we have the warlord let's

see which one of those like looks which

one of those looks like the more the

damage dealing type the warlord yep well

it's hard to tell they're both basically

sword and board heavily are actually

this guy's got a halberd so this halberd

a little bit more damage and it's not

reach but they're both they're both

heavily armed fighters the only

difference is their technique so there

isn't really a which one's nastier which

one's heavily armored

the warlord is a lot noodley or in

tactical

I think the eldritch Knights a little

bit more straightforward but the older

snide also has spells yeah I don't think

Britney Hill does not me use theirs both

I don't think it what's the save on

burning halo it's Christmas yeah so use

it against some people Oh charisma who I

don't even know who that would be here

probably I don't know that any of them

have really high charisma frankly how

much damage you can do because burning

halo can take somebody over Musa bonus

to put the seal on this wizard okay the

wizard is kind of alarmed and shots out

a vanilla rigor and the warlord says he

will die like the rest we can honestly

look at his armor like come on brother

the Ajax Ram symbol oh the list of the

priests symbol power don't forget to

hear your also butts yes that is his

three placenta 13 design it the wizard

almost early no I don't want to hear

anyone complain about my roles anymore

[Laughter]

my impression what about a 20 year old

attend a twenty20 uhit's 20 hits the

wizard

they rolled into here somewhere it's a

four it's right here yeah yeah all right

so I do

oh no the pointy misses sorry what as a

reaction there was a cast [ __ ] nowadays

he's 21

I think it's that one it's until their

next turn

nails head shield okay it's a it's a

contra bits are everyday reserved case

it's my two attacks there's my bonus

section every two months I mean if you

can get the cleric named cleric yeah

that's still roll yeah all right we

dressing loud over there no it's not

counter if it's personal it's about yeah

it's not strong if you do it over and

over again yeah I do yeah you do might

want to use a two ball yeah oh I was

here right mm-hmm yeah oh you're right

there yeah 30 yeah I was like it's under

see four o'clock oh uh so yes so what's

his new head and a sneaky cloud over on

the clear okay there's a 90 foot range

she creates 3-foot radius sphere of

yellow again

and then it is a constitution saving

through against poison and it's a DC

1414 is what I wrote

so you made it right correct okay but

there's a cloud there now on the next

train

yes somebody want to draw with a

stinking Club what's the radius it says

20 foot radius sphere so that's 8

squares across how's real Sun yet I know

you better do something spectacular well

I was gonna try and kill that cleric but

if they pushed him back and put him

inside a stinking luck yeah so what does

a stinking cloud persist and one round

by round basis yeah is a do stuff you

start in it that's the second time that

stinking cloud cock-blocked me have like

four attacks on a Danish fruit again

Finn that be

what's that he's all about the warlord

yeah the wizard says each creature that

is completely within the cloud at the

start of its turn must make a Khan save

against poison on a failed say the

creature Spence it's action that turn

retching and reeling you don't need a

breather immune to poison you oughta hit

succeed on the savings room oh so he

didn't even need to save that time he

needs to save when his turn he did but

he's succeeded or anything I guess yeah

he starts his turn

yeah so he is pre saved yeah mm-hmm well

what if he if he failed it's pretty good

yeah yeah I mean let's as a recanvass is

not a fool Cemetery I think that was

judge and buts it's the road no he's

doing that wisdom safe yeah he's held oh

he's held [ __ ] that's [ __ ] stand

Ebro

what's the DC on your [ __ ] spell

1515 that's wisdom dance hmm I'm taking

that cloak when he dies nice nice when

did we learn so he's still had it still

held slim what'd you guys think I think

I should go help with the wizard or go

after this guy take the advantage I

think that guy's got a fuckload a health

IT of a row that's when ya head off

there was a certain thing is to try and

get advantage as much as possible

does wizard that wizard could [ __ ] our

day I mean judges down there do you know

that is your misty set it's a bonus

action right I have it cuz you could you

can get advantage on the wizard that's

the same as you could and the Wizards

gonna be easy with it as well mister

your floors the same oh it's right but I

mean is that guy just gonna those two

fighter guys in amongst our squishies

it's not a great or thing well but our

two fighter guys are in amongst their

squishies up one mm-hmm

I don't know just boots windows that

conspire guy if it's you - is there guys

on there squishy I see what you're

saying I mean who who would slim go for

the warlord son would go for a warlord

with arcs an order at this character

it's not your turn and says here they

took a reaction against em and says he

says shake it off and this character

makes their save what they're no longer

help all right I'm gonna go after that

gonna use my my action to do the

you know the four charges from the gym

do the the one that gives one who gives

a 38 crazy more damage yeah that one and

then I will action surge where's that

I don't think fire flame strike who lets

its run fire I need to give myself a

little bit else you just got singed yeah

that was singeing so I mean it's not

gonna give me much is it I'll use I used

as a bonus action I'll use three of my

healing light dice think I'm through

this on myself right yeah honey I had

before so I'm gonna do a ten eleven for

the Oh Bella 15 well you got some nasty

spells in there right

well you said whatever that month did to

me oh you can't cast I can't do

concentration spells right correct yeah

well you could guess you could cast the

spell but you would not be able to

maintain concentration so the effect

would happen and then it would

immediately go away okay how long is

that last until he saves you make you

sweat no well not till the end of his

next round end of my next round correct

[ __ ] you know so the end of this this

one okay so the until they cannot

maintain concentration till the end of

extra you can still cast the spell but

if it just would do its thing and then

and then end mm-hmm you can cast spells

you just can't concentrate hard enough

to keep them up yeah I mean how do you

or anyone Haake he's already gone yeah

he's already gone huh mmm

I mean I could just blast her in the

head right but she's right if you can

hit him her I don't know they're right

next to me though right do I get

disadvantage because they're right next

to me if I use a aldrich blast

I think mm-hmm elders blasters arranged

attack right yeah I don't remember this

works it's a thing we said so annoying

yes range here but Odie would cancel a

disadvantage right if I use him for help

mmm-hmm yeah but that's an actual answer

well that's why you put him there don't

you just get advantage from blinking

yeah

what depends on who's casting it I

honestly don't know it's not my ranged

attack in melee page 195

I think we talked twice before when we I

know we talked about before it just

doesn't comprehend drowse or attacking

us what's up ranged attacks a close copy

I'm making kissy faces I like aiming a

ranged attack is more difficult when if

I was next to you when you make a ranged

attack with a weapon a spell or some of

the means you have distant evangelism

elevator within 5 feet of a hostile

feature you can see us again so you're

trying to make a ranged attack including

a range spell attack volume exit and

there somebody standing next to you you

have disadvantage and it actually

doesn't say target a me a ranged attack

when making use of disadvantage within 5

feet of a hostage sure who can see you

and isn't incapacitated it doesn't mean

it doesn't matter if you're attacking

them or not

the cleric was not making a ranged

attack I'm just gonna tell you up the

clerk was just casting a spell it seemed

that monk to get better at me you're

gonna cast blight on it which isn't

licensed raishin but their target makes

a con safe hang on still takes 8 d8r on

success sorry I got so many books

[Music]

I'm sorry you're casting what again

light what about what level spell is

that it is 1/4 oz p.m. oh okay

the wizard the wizard sees you casting a

spell within 60 feet of her and says

stop

I am Jordy and now the wizard has to

make a saving of the wizard have to make

a spell craft check and the nisi is 14

can't counter the counter what do I need

to await your spell your son anything

else yet do that oh you just raised my

rod he kisses what does it say on the

rod I can rod uh but I better papa

reactions are being targeted by spell

target - did he target me

bye-bye sorry by a note to fifth-level

spell make a christmas save vs d c---ten

+ spell level ok success equals spell no

effect make a save

which one was there floor works is my

plight look yes

yeah a little counter the counter spa

you'll absorb the can you get ask us

like that

well I'm full travel using spell soft

foot backward what was it again sorry

somebody I think it's a charisma Jack

Christmas my old boots the matter I

wrote it too ah so you you hope you go

to cast blight on the monk and you here

the wizard and it's just one it's just a

semantic component she just says stop

and you spin around and hold out your

rod and spell you fail to counter the

spell you're out you're blight is used

up mark off the spell yeah I'll lose my

that well I can't use that ability to

the long rest either on that road I'll

pop my rod away then for another day

kill that [ __ ] wizard judge at the

this is the are you done which yeah this

is the end of the first round of combat

against the black eye impact and all of

you all are still conscious and awake

and one of them's dead I don't know what

you guys worried about yeah yeah well

that one another 20 yeah that was nice

just do that buy more time he's bills

bills one [ __ ] head cut off made up

for the rest of yeah not doing much yep

a little bitter after that let's see wha

one out of six ain't bad yeah

yeah he's already used his billing

ability he's just got five attacks now

that's a cuts the I know the question is

who is he he's the one that's basically

I can when you just did right right okay

so if it was if they had succeeded that

spell would have had no effect on you

like that counter spell would not have

worked and you also would have ruined a

spell song yeah otherwise the first DC

Timbers oh that's just like the that's

the base save so like whatever there's

ball right yeah but leach like I'm not

don't tell me hit point total Oh tell me

cuz this guy doesn't know me a boy job

well nobody can look at you and see

whether or not you're doing all right

let's take this one twenty me I be

honest grieve sorry I'm sorry you take

12 plus oh you take 16 poison how much

I'll go fifteen so why so leach goes

down so now how does attacking somebody

was unconscious work again you done oh

okay I think it's an automatic it's to

death that's two deaths if they hit its

to death say failures if they hit I

think it's a crit or some [ __ ]

it's or Auto crits if I hit okay how do

you miss yeah I don't know yeah yeah I

know it's under attack attacking as

someone who's prone is automatic

advantage I believe

somebody who's doubt I don't see how you

you miss the tackle against creature has

advantage if they were than a five feet

so he's got he's got four more attacks

so here's one with advantage he's trying

to kill each he's trying to leave Bleach

goes down and he has a decision whether

or not to continue with enough to finish

off the the Warlock or to go after the

dude who killed his head bees it killed

his boss he's got four more hits he's

just gonna literally trying to bludgeon

leech to death the chances of him

failing or not what's wrong replies oh

yeah yeah that's a 15 and a 17 so that's

a automatic crit and I don't do damage

you just take two failed death saves

okay yeah yeah so he's got three more

attacks

he's gonna kill me six destroy your dad

so he's inflicted four deaths for death

saves on you you watch as as he just

punched his leech over and over again

and his ribcage explodes and as hard as

humbled and leech gurgles and and OD

goes and goes point hey hey guys he Oh

No yeah he got away he got back to be a

lot easier so that's that was his not a

happened to him just walking into it

right yeah and he has advantage from

blanket yep

[Music]

sixteen plus I think that's just and he

cannot hit you with three attacks

because he only has two attacks left so

you take 17 points damage to its King

dong junior officer I think I got to do

the thing junior officer leach has been

ordered remind me ah q Minton commit su

all right well so you're gonna you're

gonna I'm gonna make a concordance role

here behind the screens suppose of you

who have no idea what's about to happen

it has long been a tradition among my

D&D group going back to the 1980s that

in dire straits anybody but it's much

more likely to work if you are somebody

who has a god or a celestial patron like

a cleric or a paladin or warlock can

call upon their God in a moment of need

and depending on the your what's called

concordance which is a combination of a

lot of stuff including the kinds of

deeds you've done over the not even you

got happy there God might help you out

and help out can come in many different

forms like you can get a blessing your

God could unfuck something horrible

that's happened recently or your God

could send an extra planar being to help

you don't you do it did you have a spell

I can't cast spells right now cuz I'm

silence or not silence I had mad

so I have to think oh my god right yeah

yeah

I won't remember the right way the judge

has the ability to help somebody if

somebody fails a safe to make them

succeed I'm just saying that I don't you

forget okay good mmm you forgot it all

right what is your what is your silent

prayer that you say to occu meets it uh

you wrote this down you wrote down I

always wrote that we face the minions of

he who threatened Sagara that's true

mage axis fighting Ajax is currently

warring against a car if these heathens

deliver the Emperor's Wars to him the

Sun will set in pagará I call upon your

fire to cleanse the shadow from this

land until the grievous blow to those

who would desecrate vergara Oh LC LC

king close his eyes and pray some of you

who have a ventured with the chain for a

long time have seen him do this before

it doesn't always work and you feel your

consciousness cast out and you know what

it's like to be blessed by alchemy Tzu

but that's not what happens there's some

other entity intercepting your prayer

and you hear you hear a voice that you

recognize and it it it echoes across the

battlefield I miss those days days of

high adventure when you were loyal

before your commander betrayed me on the

word of that infernal tiefling

in memory of those days

and you'll fine words except this well

let the lady of fire I think that was

just yeah maybe that's the lady afire

that's the queen of brass whoa betray

her she was a dump oh yeah so that's

she's in this plane I'm trying to think

where this creature would and won what

so wait where do you want where do you

want this bad guy where do you want this

new ally

he's your ally I would like them to

eviscerate that rogue okay doesn't say

okay you see yeah Kratos lobster arm

excuse me oh [ __ ] all over the place he

appears and says so

diddly can you hear that no I know this

item or of dust yeah so this one of

these creatures Oh shows up and says you

know in it in a deep booming voice the

lady of fire sends her regards

death to Ajax hell yeah yeah a creature

gets to go now you control Seraphim

three three three thank you for the gift

of subs

okay so at our friend and former

coworker Frieda wolf

that was super cool so at the start of

each of the Templars turns each creature

within 5 feet of it takes 5 1 d-10

piercing damage

well the start of each of its turns

which was now yes so you control you

control that creature so the how much

damage does the row take our youth at

infinity fling that was mentioned I

don't know if you were on in the chain

for or damage damage fool not a

completely accurate black God so he's

going to make for help and attacks whoa

swimming away - lightning - fire no no

no no wait for huh jeez hmm all right so

he's gonna make for halberd attacks on

that guy with advantage that's not great

but that's a 16 miss hmm

close these different ones small

16 plus 9 that's a hit at the Rose ACSF

so that's one

[Music]

2:18 that's two and a nineteen lon

[Music]

what did you say he was is this is a is

a c-17 used lightning actually so I use

one lightning at the end

oh so that's gonna give you more details

go ahead keep you something grabbed I up

another nine damage another nine damage

and 3d6 and then 11 damage he's gonna

lazy uncanny dodge against the 11 damage

to reduce it by half that's five damage

from that what was the rest was at nine

I was nine nine eleven nine so nine nine

and five is 18 and 5 its 23 Jesus

I think that's this many okay and can

that rogue do anything about that part

with uncanny dodge uncanny die I mean he

seems he seems or I should say she she

seems surprised but those those attacks

didn't do a whole lot

[Music]

that's king are you done king yeah I

think it's an action okay my turn so I'm

gonna go ahead and make the save against

that guy's thing this I wasn't with save

right to get your voice back yeah

yes no hang in a minute let me make sure

I thought it was way to make sure is

he's a monk it is weeds yeah we're old a

20 in their way alright yeah twenties oh

no max age but yes well I know that's

right 13 plus that's more than enough to

beat any of these guys that's DC so

that's King done and now it's the

Wizards term wizard let's see

[Applause]

[Music]

intercepted but still with help it's a

nice little a loop hey the old Lu I

guess that's not really an Lu but I

don't know what you're talking about

we got a dude oh I seen her sounded by

the one down one in yeah about to die I

guess out these guys know she sounded

like kind of evil right yeah I thought

she was sending something to [ __ ] us you

said such nice things about me in the

Chronicle I remember when we can't be in

together

yeah there was just something she

doesn't she doesn't blame well the

commander that betrayed us but she

doesn't blame him King for what happened

she blames someone else okay yeah so you

guys were tight huh no she doesn't blame

herself well that's too bad uh I need to

figure out she was more introspective

realize I know how cover worked and I

assume that it's Joe you have

disadvantage on attacks there's

different types of converters like there

was a time it's funny that we don't

really use a lot of these rules these

days but they used to be super important

oh I don't even see cover here we go in

86 oh sorry

ha plus two AC and Dixie

yeah it's not advantage for cover stuff

3/4 plus 5 AC total cannot be targeted

all right I don't think it's time here

we go yeah half car is just plus two I

see one of the rare instances where

fifth edition uses just a bonus normal

everyday DD boats so then the question

is has anybody else gone nope

so go ahead and give your this guy an

opportunity attack who held Birdman

Albert Albert yeah yeah he's really done

anything nice he's got me bidding okay

oh this flinging that held brick around

yeah

yeah he's got a reaction actually called

nah nah yeah for sure class one he older

twenty which is none okay got each model

fight you're older twelve yeah so yeah

you're able to you're able to move and

do it he stabbed me with the spear and I

go nah with my shield no bra and then I

move backwards away from him you know

his nah

yeah wait you come over and hang out I

move it over by Kratos okay mmm that's

enough

trying to figure what this guy is going

to do I apologize oh yeah butts is gonna

run in and try to harvest leeches brain

wanna make a potion of drought control

rebuilding o3 field it could come on

controllably even more snitches in a

different body

yeah : H that's right OD now you can

actually be the half to lie seal thing

you can't tell you know now I did good

number one cave my chest in Zhong Kui

anyway this is definitely a this is

gonna be tricky

but you died yeah alright so the Wizards

gonna cast a spell it's not arranged

today

yeah but to save up if it was like you

rolled to hit then usually there's no

yeah yeah there's no attack role um so

the last time fireball was cast on the

staff he's apt it can I do that or no

I'm sorry what yeah this is the rod of

absorption we took from the the if maybe

was or wasn't so let's say fireball I

said to the Anna's oh oh that's right I

forgot about that you guys have two of

those now basically so while holding

this rod you can use your reaction to

absorb a spell oh that says that it's

targeting you only yeah a [ __ ] gift

cheater

yeah well they're yours isn't as good as

um well at least I had that so yeah the

the High Templar of dust butts and King

all have to make

leave its reflexive ex oh my god that's

a reflex the baby backs is you know hey

any ninth chapter no they've become

position so that just II actually what

is the area effect the metal get a

20-foot I held it on the road but Matt

broke it with them it's like a whole

person you can just hold them in aim and

other people hit him it doesn't break it

not really that's that's on here because

I was like a whole person in scroll and

I learned I wasn't using this because I

was like well somebody's just gonna

whack them yeah that's nice maybe that's

here that we got yeah it's if you turn

on dead and maybe also fear so yeah it

is a deck safe from King and butts and

the High Templar dust what I think I'm

[Music]

okay what a judge to say 16 Templar dust

got a 12

sorry doesn't matter a High Templar best

was immune to fire damage ah suck his

helper on me because they take damage

based on the level of the spell I do so

she's gonna lose three health five I

think

[Music]

these little one free total [ __ ] yeah I

think something okay so you don't you

don't keep tracking out of HP I see now

they were like up you're like oh really

simplifies character I get it so if she

were to save against it button spells

like fireball or you simply tap damage

how does that work yeah it's 37 damage

she's right if you did you guys get I

got a six he's immune to fire but it has

anything else that was run away

screaming yeah oh well I know a deep

down yeah kill me okay now don't worry I

didn't know I didn't and that's a wizard

the wizard on television I yep okay know

what you get a new copper do we have

another copy of strongholds and

followers I you type so you write it

yeah there's only like a standard

edition I said so

can you get one of the ones with the

cover hangs see Carrie thank you Wow you

can't do home Streisand spelled either I

can oh I'm just when I think I'm gonna

work this baby said it was a scroll okay

mm-hmm but I also know it cuz if it's

from a scroll then I just last for the

duration yep what do you mean by last

iteration it doesn't take your

concentration if you cast it from a

scroll slim is the one that chopped off

the head of that yep so the eldritch

Knight looks to the heavens and uses his

action to call upon Saint Ajax he calls

for aid from the iron Saint grant us a

boon we our greatest warriors against

these infidels no it's a it's as you

should know Mars it's just him Frank I

try not to bother my god well I mean no

reason to yeah you're only dead now I

wouldn't like the day is young l told

you a dinner read your item oh no you

know what the Dickens what's that

stupidity a flesh thing it's the Lord of

the core of all flesh so we're done

another wiener

we're actually dead do you think but if

he dies does he go away that's all I'm

thinking yeah we got a decent mood and

you got the broken one that hasn't been

in it's we're dead

okay they got the broken one what I mean

that's better I don't know if I know

about this guy I check the Chronicle I

paid you can't already middle the fight

you just try to remember I mean he could

just try to remember I've read he spends

all his time reading that's on the it's

15 so this is what the older snipe does

this is his turn so he doesn't get to do

anything else but now in our dictum goes

to act on his hands and he's as you can

tell he's got this huge [ __ ] off great

sword hmm she kind of tapped this dopey

come tell you something sick enough

bring it

he does not have it looks like it

doesn't have advantage Oh what does the

15 let me know about melador dictum stop

distracting and these turns are taking

forever each time each time you time you

heard him he grows don't hit him he

grows each day each time you hit him he

goes he grows new limbs and gets more

well he doesn't get more attacks he does

more damage cuz he's what if he kurtsyn

is the end of him yeah of course you can

chop his head off just like anything

else how the [ __ ] are you supposed to

hurt him that assume you fight Eldridge

he's not immune to damage

he just gets he gets buffed every time

he gets so if we get rid of the eldritch

maybe he'll go away maybe

let's kill King first and see what King

can use that misty step 23 yeah c23 13

yeah changer I was one smash I kill me

Eldridge right and I can cast my person

at parallel he swings a sword twice

misses once and then tries to just bash

it in stole it disorients way over there

from being summoned so change it to 6

Wow yeah well at least like this this

sword is crazy I

we got this was he holding person twenty

point twenty points of damage from one

great sorted okay and and and malodor

dictum looks at looks around the

battlefield and he says this would be an

excellent place to rule okay that was um

the eldritch night yep and it's copper a

big captain right had a plan but now we

are probably going to actually take a

break in the middle is common what was

your what was your plan well I was gonna

try and take out that guy but like that

dudes three guys on slim if you're gonna

miss the step out think of it this way

you can't I already used it yeah you're

worth oh yeah you moved it to olds if

the maybe it's 8:35 oh wait did I use it

no and you never used the noodle written

it down no you moved me over there so I

can miss you step right you didn't move

it you did use it yeah okay yeah that's

what got you in range I'm gonna think

I'm gonna focus on that

well uh uh cuz he's been hurt pretty bad

alright yeah we don't know we're gonna

figure out if we take out me if we if

like if I go down does my guy go away I

don't remember I think it varies yeah

let's I'm gonna start with the thief I

just want to do this you guys haven't

actually done a lot of damage these guys

know we like a little slim guy accurate

we haven't done like any damage Oh

so this battles got a long way to go

yeah okay we'll finish this round and

then we're just gonna take a break oh

you know some of you guys probably want

to keep fighting but for my own yeah my

own brain this is a pretty complex

battle tonight no yep okay 22 tit yeah

okay you're nine damage this is the road

right yeah nine damage yeah 14 that

probably misses correct bless you thank

you thank you well that's you know

always a get because worth a he's right

behind him so yeah okay I'll use

ferocious attack claw claw by tentacle

tentacle yeah oh yeah it was the one of

us is one of big cats new frost

abilities it's quite a few though by the

way don't forget that these doors are

open these doors are closed these are

the doors that are sealed

it could got gold in them and these are

the goal these are like those except the

gold is melted out in there open

yeah how would you suggest there's so

many attacks like would I roll all of

them first and then do damage like do

well the only reason you would break you

would not is if you are planning on but

actually you can't you can't well yeah

you could is break it up I'm gonna do a

cup I and then I'm gonna move and do a

couple of tacks on that coyote yeah but

if you're like nope I don't think this I

don't think this is gonna kill this guy

yeah and there would be no reason not to

just roll them all but like you're gonna

you also have to keep tries and say I'll

do different damage you'd have to keep

track of like yeah if you roll all the

attacks you're gonna have to remember

which ones hit and which ones didn't

does each do different damage

okay 1919 plus six it's hip I'll just do

this oh I'll just go one by one

seven twelve damage does he get her do

people get reacted [ __ ] are playing

thieves do people get reactions every

term or once per round

can he use his reaction against this how

much times you saying I think you can

well uncanny dodge once per round

yeah what you did last ones per your

reaction doesn't recharge until their

next turn okay 18 plus 6 hits yeah that

makes yeah 5 6 7 8 9 9 damage I'm gonna

do a lot of tension

so that's claw claw bite that's gonna

miss 6 plus 8 yep

bite tentacle tentacle APIs

[Music]

15:15 AC yeah 16 that 16 plus 8 mm

technical is 6 yes no we're gonna find

that information about this a lot of

damage concentration how much damage 11

got it maybe like online and then I'm

gonna use nibble escapes it doesn't do

distance very opportunity attack that's

you yeah cuz he's in with ranks I'm

gonna do I'm gonna mm-hmm unless

something happened which was nibble is

who was using nimble skater was it I am

conference yeah so he can't take

opportunity to tax on me since he's

within reach is a halberd and let's get

something I'm gonna start moving nimble

escape doesn't let me take it to

opportunity tax all right is it

disengage as a bonus action unless

that's whatever disengages I get to do

that as a bonus yeah let me see hang on

a second this is the busy father's night

if a matters he did her to use that on

me this turn uh yeah I know you can do

it Oh have I mentioned that the elders

nights skin seems to be made of iron no

no the older tonight skin seems to be

made of iron

oh he's not like iron gone or anything

he just [ __ ] dead thing on them being

dead

[Music]

alright thanks Jerry so that was copper

and bootcut huh

[ __ ]

Mariah nothing else did they get naked

you always do well when you're naked

I don't know I wanna do something like

that I don't know what's gonna work or

who I should target or if I should do

something crazy all right well it's a

long way

all right and he goes that's [ __ ]

they're gonna beat on you you should

yeah I can do whatever I want like

punched I mean I knew you move to give

me advantage would be good yeah I could

certainly do that hmm if you can't get

out I mean if you can get out get out

that does not get one more step away

yeah but this yeah this

you have advantage with the visibility

anyway yeah you do really yes I haven't

managed to hit yes okay soon and see

what the swords coming from I mean

that's that seems reasonable to me well

yes I know that they have disadvantage

because it's like they're it's like

they're blind basically there's actually

no difference yeah between being

invisible and you know me being blind i

[Music]

right yeah make sense to me

yeah that's how I would rule enough for

me trying to desperately keep my guys

alive desperately you say boots are you

done uh they've only killed none of you

and you've killed one of them so far

weary days going on what's that in SPO

inspiration oh you can kill me you

you're invisible and I'm just standing

there taunting them singing your praises

so you realize you realize that if you

get hit you gotta make concentration

checks right just making sure realize

you're invisible yeah okay the only one

of them your turn the only one with them

that gets to go between now and Slim's

action is the Rope right just kill them

all slim so I believe boots has done its

judgment so I'm gage and use the rest of

my movement to move move there and then

oh no I didn't actually don't want to

use my disengage because I need to be

able to it's about a section curtains

her attack of opportunity

yeah yeah her attack misses so yeah it's

the Muslims it's so the right the Rigel

Kent says now Salome needs to make the

predator noise so I'm gonna go ahead and

cast interdicted Terra test which means

that I believe every enemy because I'm

within range yeah it's all gonna have a

steel applied to them without taking a

my fields legally right now you get to

keep all your I'm probably gonna take

your spell's away that do things with

your seals besides that because I think

ill rigor should be using spells to time

you put cc's on bad guys in unorthodox

ways and then how their seals work is

not about because it's too big of an

opportunity any magnets work so it's a

matter of picking is that an action

thing that's Bell know sealed oh wait

what do you do so I should put a seal on

every bad guy around here I'm a seal but

can't cast another spell in the same

turn [ __ ] minigames watching you guys

oh my god so I think I can't I don't

have movement and I can't reach anybody

alright there's a big girl

yes oh yeah bro we just ran out of seal

yeah or they're used to the bogus damage

yeah he's the rogue is the only one

that's a thing get hurt I think the most

a 2d6 because I do damage [ __ ] going on

too much [ __ ] going on sometimes we've

had whole sessions where no dice will

roll yeah this is not one of those yeah

okay we started out rolling dice like

instantly yeah so I'm gonna throw my

first Jobling at the rogue guy okay as I

say an eight what's an eight plus eight

plus three a c-17 oh no [ __ ] maybe I

want that man foot telling [ __ ] no in

real life

okay eventually what I'm done there's so

glad to be contributing to this

initiative right where we're all in ones

and so this is the kind of the thing

with the ideas that like if the heroes

can't roll above a nine all night or the

DM can't roll below a 17 it's gonna be

bad

yes sir what my brother's Farrell oh

that is how boy all right

does he watch the stream what's a real

earlier on the worm yeah that was it two

times three times there's be the last

time she leaves you were yeah oh you did

ones I think in range of this they're

rowing the old schnikes both the room

calls upon the power of Ajax and they

both become living shoutouts oh yeah you

just do it no we were gonna kill you

yeah it can move through solid objects

and even you people it's just difficult

to rank you doesn't take opportunity

attacks yeah well I mean if you guys

it's three of us yeah if you guys want

to make opportunity yes yeah go right

ahead but it's gonna be half damage cuz

he's not a physical object anymore yeah

it's three of us nothing right damage is

there

this is a magic weapon right 1970 Oh

actually does he want to go over there

remember one two four five six seven

eight damage / uh-huh

King doesn't take opportunity attack oh

weapon a thief come up behind you shank

you

yeah that's fire enlightening so they

run past me

yeah circumnavigate around here thanks

11 damage from the High Templar bust got

it

he's definitely the closest to death of

all of the members of all the members of

the black iron pact that still have

their head the rogue is the closest to

too young still no one here correct and

he is going to take Oh whose is this use

of mine I'm rolling it for a while it's

cursed

who's ever done that such don't touch it

it's pure evil

mom get it off the board boots what's

your honor class 17 so he gets three

attacks

[Music]

a nine misses but a 17 hits and a 12

plus eight seconds so is sneak attack is

a reaction isn't it that's what it's I

have no idea no speak attack is it's not

every thing isn't it's not every attack

it's it's once per turn and it's like an

addendum to an attack that has a bandage

basically so you take 2d6 from - it's

plus 5 - 6 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 sneak attack

one normal everyday Rhodes to the

bathroom is just the thing Rhodes can do

like 10 20 30 - 35 38 more damage

I'm dead what's goes down not dead it's

tired I'm tired how many hit points

join me master oh [ __ ] how many hit boys

did you have I had 34 okay so I'm not

dead dead just down yeah yes yes I

didn't say locked up tunnel at the end

there's just me yeah you see this this

road go he becomes this ghostly smoke

like shadow it moves across the

battlefield and then he becomes solid

and goes truth and shanks boots and

boots drums I'm not invisible anymore oh

[ __ ] it's judge no wait that was that

was the road sleep now it's that was

Road slim we're almost at the head

around to it Slim is surrounded

mmm-hmm basically gotta pray for 20 at

this point I only got two attacks no I

mean really uh I can cast it again yeah

but it's a wisdom save and those are

wise people not the cleric is so is the

monk yes probably

[ __ ] me they're all that goes on that's

dead big nasty big nasty I don't know

nothing to it even touched it yeah yeah

no but if we hit the big nasty where

it's this but not good yeah

see find knew what I was gonna do when

you read the monk the master of jackal

says what is it

and the priest says a filthy gift trash

washed up on the shores of our world and

the monk says let's send it back

[Music]

words like Oh like there's no way I'm

gonna drop that big guy

I did I did forget the absalom unless I

get a twenty other than that I don't

think so you get in there out two months

yeah the infantry Danny all right I'm

just going to start whistling no this is

gonna start Wacka Wacka when you're held

at Wacken we got a basically paper for

it I'm going to use a superiority die

refrain ting attack so that will give me

advantage on my next attack well that's

good that also adds that much damage I'm

gonna I'm gonna hit the priest yeah 18

it's okay don't forget that already

inspiration as well also you don't

forget your ass ionic nonsense yeah I

got it

[Music]

all right so let's see here as so that's

20 damage on the greased 26 damaged all

right

okay I'm going to do that again and I'm

going to use the superiority I die to do

it again get advantage 18 hits all right

so that's actually that last attack what

did I say it was 26

yeah it's actually 31 okay so laughter

that was 31 damage yeah sorry I forgot

to add my strength

[Music]

34 damage noise slim Hughes about

himself as mighty a great sort and twice

slams into this priest of the iron Saint

can cancel um have his commander ability

attack

what's this commander ability today when

I give us women in fact the I forgot how

my show works yeah I forgot that gets

limited back yeah it seems fair cuz I

forgot it have I forgot to have that

dude make his buddy

succeed on the signal flow until like

the next the next player's actions this

isn't any different so make an effects

alone so I'll see y'all yeah I'm gonna

do the same thing wait have you

succeeded

do you still you have your voice back

yet yeah okay no wait a minute all the

okay no 20 it's curious how you know

what I cheated I can only the fainting

attack is a bonus action so I can only

do that once a turn and so which so the

feigning attack is one that gives you

advantage yeah okay well just roll this

next attack normally uh to the last one

I would have hit uh neither died anyway

I believe it yeah yeah alright oh

whinnies you choose to use it after you

roll yeah that's a nineteen yeah yeah

making a [ __ ] champion is my next

character and what else can I use this

on basically any d20 roll okay so those

ability checks alright so

all right what the hell I'm going to use

a menacing attack for this all the sound

of that

wow I mean the chances I'm saving are

pretty high no but I'm gonna try it

anyways correct I'm I'm just down okay

conscious like super-dead like leech

well the monk does go next my chest

hasn't exploded yet yeah I'm a bit bit

miss guys going down the ghost of Leeds

Leeds

well you're not get screwed on amethyst

let me just make a guess I want to make

sure I'm right cuz it sounds really high

38

with the right so that's that's 16 22 28

35 mm-hmm 38 plus 5 so 43 damage yeah

you math to run so you've done 108

points of damage to this priest in one

round good yeah

no um I want to get the [ __ ] out of here

yep and I'm probably gonna take a couple

hits doing it but [ __ ] it what the only

question is what's the best way to so

remember there's a cloud over here

oh yeah yeah that's looking tan away

from I would I could maybe cut through I

could scoot through and go over to where

judges I would take 15 30 yeah and I

would take a opportunity attack from

them do you have on cheese River fine

I do all right go ahead take your

opportunity attacks who a monk in the

fashion monk what's your class 18 it's

90 points of damage scrapes and maladaar

dick dick dick tune in greatsword plus 9

oh well I have a 9 is 40 name is sad to

be a two-slit I think I could do

something Oh 46 plus some more - ish I

don't if you wanna hit that guy though I

love the fat slim could 1v1 himself and

kill himself in one round I'm done

Slim's done the priest is dead that's

the end of round two we're gonna take a

break it's 9 o'clock we'll be back in 13

minutes minutes we're back oh there's

been much discussion uh-huh and

everybody agrees let's mark that this is

[ __ ] are you kidding no sane Dungeon

Master would throw an encounter like

this against their players I personally

I hope you guys win are you talking -

yes

so do we have fan art did Lars art the

fans okay there's some that's uh there's

some we may depending on the flow of fan

art we may start going to fan out every

other week we'll see we'll see I was

this is the point during the drank spurt

sticking around folks I hope that I know

that's I know that for some people just

watching people roll dice and do math is

not not that exciting but if you're

sticking around and watch them then you

are favorite people

thanks to all people who have summed

remember that if you have Amazon Prime

you get a free twitch prime sob you can

throw to your favorite streamer streamer

with the best hair I think is how it's

supposed to work this is one of the

things that happens when we livestream

our game is that it inspires people to

make art and that our us making art

inspiring other people to make art is

one things inspire systems are super

neat King more somebody ok Mitsu beam is

the fireball in saudi so cool I love

that eyes are like cat eyes 2300 people

still watching this is a cooking right

is that who's that what is it somebody's

wearing is like amazing

yeah I also love the way oh yeah that

her speech is represented with oh yeah

no it's the bars yeah yeah that is

really awesome

yeah that's pretty awesome

I would love to see ya yeah thanks we

left our heroes slim had killed the

priest two of them down

where's where's the leech cart you

that's right I know it was in your book

I saw one in a book oh yes

yeah I am I am I just like the idea of

having all the dead folks over here on

one part oh yeah so here's leech leech

is dead he's gone back to that was a

good drawing

he's a devil now so now we begin round 3

the monk goes first first monk goes then

King goes so larks you are on deck and

the monk someone blew up and seized

Boots's unconscious form and like kicks

him once which is an advantage attack

just boots

not the one that no that's a 10 and an

18 I mean that's to death saves it's one

attack John yeah yeah the boots yeah

the boots only help you SJ may says my

name is boots

you killed my surgeon protected I this

Mont can only kill things that are

[ __ ] laying down unconscious right

they'll get to you in a minute yeah

that's so

so yeah you see the monk and boots his

head explodes

what the Dickens they're repelled until

steps on your head to make sure your dad

I'm sure I mentioned in some video

somewhere and he's got three more

attacks that he's got his movement uh

three attacks is enough money you can

sit right between us if he wants yeah he

could three attack three tax is enough

to disorient someone which will rob slim

of his proficiency modifier if he hits

with all three of them

he doesn't have advantage Riva but he

does get three attack so I'm just gonna

roll 320 side dice slimmer C's 18 choke

three it doesn't hit but 219 does so

that's just to the agnostic suits you

joined me South Caston 16 points an

average thing alright so he missed with

one he did miss with money all right I'm

gonna use my superior die and do a

repost nice and try to that'll be the

first damage that's gonna stay smack him

Mac sake mid soup least 20 people shot

here Tom the lighting

21:20 I so badly we're taking that guy's

head off and he's gonna be our

thaumaturge I think that's not gonna

happen

you guys probably gonna be Dylan that's

how they feel about you and their boots

go and they I believe are tied I believe

it's time to dead on their side to dead

on your side at this rate you all doc

two people kill each other a 31 damage

cheese guy yeah let's let's first damage

he has bacon was that from one attack

yes this he has gone since then which

means he has his reaction he uses it too

okay again it's one of you guys scour so

he's gonna he's gonna turn into a

sandstorm and flow through the the he's

not a paladin he is a published night

turns into a lightning storm of dust you

can see red lightning arcing through it

so he's gonna need to make a DC 15

Constitution stay at DC 15 concept

that's what happens if he makes us safe

he does

so he's halberd with the bandage with

big cat and that's not great that's a

miss

17 and 16 that's a hits uh well both 912

plus 9 is 21 as I hit him

yeah that's good yeah no more uh 206 so

6 plus 6 plus 9 is 15 it does not and

that was his third no that was our

audience has been slowly ticking up

every week yeah thanks for watching

everybody that makes me happy to see

that we are engaging an audience that we

wasn't engaging yes we were that back

when we were alive back rubber back we

played D&D everyone Stephanie we're

alive good times

very good yeah and then Kings gonna move

over here and put his hand on King

Neil's

and put some hand where leeches chest

cavity once was and you see the power

this this blue glow and calls upon the

power of the the god of the Sun

Nakamatsu

and leeches heart reconstitutes and

begins beating again veins spread out

his chest cavity seals up and his eyes

flash opening oh and he gasps and I

believe that I'm that was gonna make me

go after King figure out how can you do

that again I am little ways to get spell

slots back right now

so OD doesn't come back to the east

thing you have to summon Simon do nope

okay yeah yeah you have anymore your

healing light oh just Oh actually what

do I come back as well you come back

with one hit point come back blowing one

go blimey well I'm gonna used to mine

it's a trap thank you for the gift

itself last week we had a very generous

fan viewer calmus gifted a ridiculous

number of subs in exchange for getting a

junior officer frost named after him and

that was a moment of it is not normal

for out normally the reward for gifted

subs is keep in mind that we only get

like half that money it's mostly people

who want to support the community

because it's giving other people

subscriptions to the channel that lets

them if you use all the cool emotes in

chat it's um I think access to the

subscriber only discourse so we our

policy for gifted subs is not that was a

one-time exception thing we made so I

don't want people to feel like they can

buy their way into the chain okay when I

use a quick couple of heating lights on

myself so got us off to seven health and

then I'm kind of in my I guess shock of

dying and coming back to life think very

carefully about what you do with what

the time you have I I cry out again to

my celestial again okay well once I did

right did you once lungs many many times

good right but I turn my Lau's back so

you don't know you don't know who your

patrons I cry out you were before you

were but this is what how you became a

warlock it was he called out to the

cosmos parade mm-hm and something some

some power yeah one time you help me

again please help you from this terrible

terrible predicament we're in and I

liked your speech because he was asking

my knees doing he was asking how

concordance I said it's this it's that

it's a rule it's based on this and you

know I think like any negotiation like

any attempt to use your skills to

influence people if you give a little

speech you get a little bonus that's all

and Lars gave a very good speech so that

means it was crap

[ __ ] L but you get your play on the

minute I read that role and see it's

never right so

I've got one sake of your 15% patron

happiness do you do crap you are you are

well disposed DeMott around alright so

what happens you know

[Laughter]

[Music]

[Laughter]

so you notice a word like if an ally

showed up to help you all [ __ ]

okay so yeah we're we're gonna be a good

place to put that I like probably and so

you know you notice this mote this tiny

you see leech plead to the cosmos leech

does not know from whence he gets his

warlock powers that has been a mystery

to him he knows that OD his M is a curse

from the matriarch he betrayed she's the

one who keeps making it so that every

time he calls upon a familiar he doesn't

get what he wants he gets this annoying

devil you see this tiny flash of light

like a pinpoint gleaming and reflecting

light it's a spinning object it grows

larger and it appears to be a spinning

sapphire and it grows larger and larger

and begins to take form an elder

sapphire dragon cut to Wizards Tower in

another world and Moon elf opening her

eyes and speaking in her windchime

language Darragh are vile silence of the

orc listens and translates and said and

he is translating what the moon elf was

saying and he says Alice an tracks

dreams she dreams worlds and worlds

within worlds what does that mean and he

turns to the sage as it says does

anybody know what that means

the mote coalesces and grows into

however uh I think you forgive me back

my yeah the sapphire this sapphire

dragon whose name you don't know enjoy

his taking other forms and he's probably

too large to fit okay so not unlike the

crater dragons they can polymorphic no

soon whatever form they want and he

appears and looks around yeah mm-hmm

and sees what's going on and looks at

the monk and says Terrans always turning

to sin you are not to blame it is your

nature but know that it cannot be

permitted and yeah so he is going to use

gosh let me see what he probably gonna

use play because I think that when when

leach did that did he then real I mean

oh by the way is it moon elf your full

up is the I mean Matt - Matt got to mess

and that's why I know all right

I still don't know my patient well I

mean you don't but I mean some people

might

yeah but Celestials next time okay at

all but that's your names for the the

elves the well but there's a celestial

court and even get a celestial court you

got a tough our dragon that's right

different well yeah I spend a lot of

time trying to feel like I don't really

my cosmos doesn't work the way the

default D&D cosmos works right and so

his celestial patron I had kind of like

translate that into what would that be

in my universe and it doesn't it's not

like one-to-one like I don't have really

like angels no I know but but that mean

in your universe aren't all the

Celestials some form of these like crazy

elf beings yeah correct but I don't

think what like that's my point

that this is this is a this is some kind

of gemstone dragon and and whoever the

moon elf is speaking about somebody else

I say and whoever that person is is

leeches patient Oh whoever that person

is is leeches patrons Mon F knows this

is the reason we couldn't we couldn't

get a full bleed art MILF back or your

elfs doing a spell slows back with that

[Music]

[Laughter]

I'm a roadie ionic charges

Wow Wow

yep Wow

this guy can summon another lf+ yeah

good this could turn into a crazy [ __ ]

about the cylinder is Jesus know so yeah

you have to make it I don't know how you

guys would know this but you have to

make a DC 22 charisma saving throat to

attack this guy because he has he has a

aura of ah he appears to be a godly

creature beyond beyond the reproach of

anyone's any mere mortal yeah take that

[ __ ] jackal ass [ __ ] man I wish I was

a monk I want that power power if you

kill these monks that are these named

monks and we're a month you take it you

become the master of jackals too so it's

cool someday when I make a monk I'm

gonna go hunt down the new master

evangelist well some what's our faithful

Elmas just gifted another hundred oh my

god am I reading that right Drock yeah

okay yeah we may be singing but one day

boss is fun because you get to go copy

by EMS I apologize for this Browns Maori

kale this whole time yeah treat people

it's been a lot my with respect yeah in

an MMO we had a first name jammed our he

was a mage but we never called him that

we always just called him Charmander

char and then eventually he renamed his

character Charmander because I keep

saying it yeah 5 10 15 20 yeah he's not

gonna stand here yeah 5 10 15 20 25 30

so this is a code either this is

something that you can do if you have

the right Sonic manifestations his eyes

glow and a blast of psionic energy comes

out of his eye is this rainbow this

rainbow fire that Bey that's the monk

and the rogue and maladaar dictum in

psionic energy yeah so I think he'll

spend 14 what's 14 beat ends yes da

charge to charge us for d6 so it's a

number of charges hanging on a DA yes 24

if you want

[Music]

maybe the chain in the black iron pack

should stand aside this is definitely

about this is I knew this is what the

intro meant by the way the title of this

episode is called ballast on track

streams right it's in quotes ah maybe

the chains of black hair pack should

stand aside and wait Troy I'm glad you

brought me back to life

[Music]

who the [ __ ] is that I was like who

could Rico would reasonably call on

their patron and what would happen and

then leech died and I was like alright

well there goes that I'm just gonna have

to explain like and his alternate

universe it was 30 35 points of damage

that that kills get out of there yeah I

hate that monk the monk is still can't

wait well well alive wet alone I mean

our dictum has not taken any damage so

valid our victim is bathed in psionic

energy man if only boots were here to

see this that was from chat that wasn't

me that was respectable panda yeah he

just made that mister the trash bandit

really my trash lineage um tell me he

has a lot of a points okay that's true

by the way I share an office with her

and let's say so you are back to full

Elf he just killed the thing they grow

from I need more bookmarks I think

that's probably all he can do that says

action is he is he kind of protecting me

there that while you move into that

position and I moved in that position

because it maximized his silent

play as a 60-foot comb uh-huh here's a

really care about you maybe I can save

you you came back to save that legendary

action paper I thought the only thing

you did about this legendary action

let's see yeah only thean of another

creatures turn it's a legendary action

work mm-hmm

yeah that's pretty cool okay so the he

goes on leeches turn this is his true

form except painted because this

probably wouldn't fit into the room I

mean fun plus he likes he likes taking

other form he likes playing dress-up

yeah yeah that's all I think a lot of

the older dragons do that shows off

their power I think that's it it's now

that [ __ ] wizard Jesus I like a

pretty supportive

oh yeah stinky cloud yeah I mean nice

that that thing actually did something

god damn it

if it worked it'd be useful

[Laughter]

it works getting in my way when I want

to attack it could be worse you could

have got hypnotized so okay the wizard

gets to go this maybe uh yeah yeah this

could be bad oh the priest is dead

mm-hmm the priest is dead resurrecting

for you whoa hang on but the priest had

a magic item and you guys don't know

what it is

this person does let's go loot it gonna

tune to that [ __ ] right now

shy though just gonna get my water on

the way out as a walk past he go she got

Tom to get it isn't doing anything now

back to life get to work that's alright

everybody gets one stream where the

characters dead for you shouldn't said

that right now yes security I'm just

gonna try it it does not require a gym

of a movement she interacts with an

object was that 30 feet that was dirty

and you are well within 16 feet judge

it a judge this is spell object seemed

to be a spell to pull spoilers a marble

or make a deck save judge oh well they

have like all kinds of names for marbles

oh well

oh yeah look I know a high bar yeah no

cats I know this is a critical this is a

critical role the feed explodes on

impact and is destroyed each creature

within a 10-foot radius of Judge must

make a huh or take damage which you did

not you did not you made you say uh-huh

then 10 feet any creature that failed

the save so it's within 10 feet of

judges everything else within 10 feet of

judge yeah me slim and the demonic

amongst there thank you guys both to

make a deck save and you monkey this is

magical it is Matt it is measurable it's

not spell

so it's amazing magic I don't you better

you have resistance against unsafe well

magic resist sure yeah was it wisdom

nope it's Dex Dex 17 okay your favorite

and the monk gets a beer right a monk

I'm not I'm sure he has a huge dexterity

no he's fine Wow yeah yeah I don't even

know need to do the math yeah what's up

the thing that I used on counter all

creatures that I'm sorry huge dexterity

go so none of you were caught in the

beat of fourths you are pushed and there

was a giant hamster ball there turn the

wizard all right because it would only

be tedious to do otherwise I'm gonna

rule that because no one was caught it

it goes away okay but but she pulled two

marbles out of that it was but I'm not

gonna fight I'm Kal roll the vial way

back I used one of those on him caught

him and his best boy in it he's like oh

he's got a scroll and you immediately

[Laughter]

scroll yo that was the wizard it's the

Eldrick night to the overnight can use

his one of his spells cuz he's got a

cool spell yes where's that chap still

about it to orange orange yeah yeah a

mallet or a dukedom girls on his trying

to Eldridge month wizard ah that's right

and I've got the yeah I think I'm gonna

focus that next

wheeze it's hiding behind a big chap

that's where he moves he's like yeah do

you want to come and get me you're gonna

have to come past this guy big chap bit

like I'm doing with Marwan

just a big move just stand behind that

guy he'll kill everyone

mm-hmm so I got it this is gonna be a

complex term because the

the Sapphire dragon is also going to use

a legendary action yeah get him do this

more often

it goes down yeah yeah yeah that's it

yeah yeah yeah I knew we kept out of

like or something okay so he is going to

yeah he gets three attacks with this

thing mr. Ellison has read that this is

one of your yeah that's the best we just

kicked sandstorm them

here backswing as you got some Longreach

think he's good he's gonna help her

oh yeah okay he's gonna basically the

same kind of weapon I thought that the

High Templar dust has helped Birdman Oh

12 plus 8 is 20 mm-hmm so all three

attacks good I rolled up for MC game

stats roll to 12 or 13 and a 15 I might

go down yeah all right back Wow he's

there I got my guy 30 points of damage

[Music]

that is the eldritch night and I think

the sapphire dragon is going to honest

action I can only do on my turn right

correct the reactions you can do well

they imagine if East are you down down

yeah all right Oh to use my surgeon

ability and this I know is a good battle

everyone is using authorship yeah

everyone is using everything they've got

relatively safety of the wings of my

friend and I will pick you up and you

get back up and you did it that let me

remind myself you spend a hit die now

just one yeah says they may spend a head

die that may not seem like much but it

means that they can't just automatically

krill hey how they've killed so far wait

wait is there me I probably do you want

to be in front of your yeah right here

yeah you guys some great effort

like it always demand and that I can

only do once per battle really must per

battle yep for the surgeon thing oh I

always Chapelle at least you back up

yeah it's going to well no I don't know

what that psionics occurred oh let's see

the monk I think for preference the

sapphire dragon yeah he uses it turns

it's sapphire eye glows and it looks

into the eye of the monk and it says

believe and the monk has to make a

saving throw

[Music]

Larry's dollars de money going next -

works

oh man used friends which is one of the

aspects of manifestation until the end

of the monks next turn you will not

attack you guys and you guys have

advantage attacks against okay well we

could still recommend it's not like

ferocity every die of damage he takes he

earns another ferocity and then honey

control how often big cat can do that

cuz they could just not leave the cat

the break and it had some dope-ass plan

she was gonna use that every what it was

yeah well then people started buying

yeah so now my do best plan I still dope

digital just a piece of pinky cool might

be a little more space on the back let's

see I'll put in like an arc or something

I mean [ __ ] devilish mark who knows if

they ended up in Desmodus land last few

minutes later oh you are aware of this

you can feel it I see you can feel it

what I do yeah I would probably know

Boots's eyes flash open and you hear

breathe again air fills your lungs

you're a super disoriented you've been

you were just you're just dead you're

but your brain is firing once again your

head reforms as mode the power of

Asmodeus causes your skull to go up

operation experience and then I know

boots get boots are gonna go after just

god damn seems like it's been pretty

dramatic so I feel I'm always thinking

about how you know I'm always think

about the viewers and about whether or

not this is any fun to watch I know that

generally speaking the blahblah is what

keeps people's eyeballs attached but I

feel like this is of all the battles

we've had this has been pretty [ __ ]

dramatic you've got a lot of extra

planar nonsense so I'm gonna move but

that all being said I don't I don't feel

as though I'm you know puffs as well

yeah yeah sweating butts is going to use

some acid splash worst weather guy that

goes guys hurting pretty bad but no sod

amongst us something right there you go

bondage okay that's a splash a jog it's

a saving throw okay I might be able to

finish the wizard off to finish the know

maybe touched boots is now mirror boots

boots is back but you have six fingers

on your right hand now baby face can you

make those seals explode I can make them

explode with the thing is then I won't

have they won't have disadvantage on

spells I want to use yeah right now

right now all these people all have

disadvantage against judges spells yeah

oh that's right I really do oh I was

cool yeah oh I wish you guys get to hope

they live and get to see it

[Music]

so he's gotta get out of there they all

the remaining members of the black iron

pact agree that they gotta do something

about this [ __ ] angel Samra ghetto

food my target must succeed it actually

held or dictum how is he is he doesn't

care about any all [ __ ] he

wants to kill that thing

mmm so uh the monk or actually I'm gonna

target I'm gonna Tori the other night

because I want to see it go away

so he needs to make an exterior saving

throw against of DC 14 the monk does

know the PC 14 with that dexterity uh

everything to see hang on a second yep

he makes it yeah 11 I rolled on 11 this

Dex is at least +3 exposure battle boots

uh or alive you have one hit boy correct

yeah here's how this goes down

uh hang on a minute are you able to get

out are you all to move in such a way

that doesn't provoke an attack

opportunity tell ya Wow how do you do

that I'm not adjacent to him oh you

weren't a Jason to that guy

no okay I thought you were no one nope

okay so what my fault this guy is our

friend right yeah right now yeah he's

like he looks he goes hello hello friend

I'm sorry he turns to this guy's

attacked me okay so that's a bunch

that's fourteen plus nine the monks AC

that

[Music]

so that's 12 damage first attack good

and then 16 plus 9 or the next Tech and

use my last little thing in the Bob

so that's 17 more damage and it's a

bonus action he almost died so what's

the total damage against the muck sorry

is it 17 from the last day yeah 17 for

the last one I'm sorry this chat

remember what this this feels like

legitimately me [ __ ] you know not

even the mods are typing so we don't

remember how much damage Birds did

probably none I'll use 60 oh that was 29

is that 29 before the 17 or is it join

on including the 7 thing it's total yeah

I think overall though it's 12 plus 17

total yeah cool okay so hang on a map so

that's 70 70 80 90 so yeah kills the

muck to say about that [ __ ] Falls big

knife I look at his limp body and I say

I say how does this go towards paying

that debt Wilson yeah

did you give did you heal yourself as

well to no one in particular we did buds

didn't we

but yep nobody shot was i he say it was

I so if I was a bus bus did a seed

splash splash and you guys kill the

Prius so he can't bring his people back

we got the other no I

and we're a banker Oh No so let's just

spread out so we can do area tag

did you that was it's slim me you healed

yourself Rajesh mom set me up so that I

had advantage on the Eldridge night I

don't know if you that guy's big that

guys 24 sorry guys I'm gonna be doing

that much damage this is against the

older tonight yeah 13 damage on that

attack okay yeah MIT so 13 so how this

is the first attack yes 20 and 11 damage

for the next I'm gonna stop you because

I wanna make sure that you know what

this works when you hit this guy with

your sword it sparks off his metal scale

and you take damage we take fire damage

oh [ __ ] so the first attack you do to

him there's a built-in fire field does

10 poison damage

oh I'm down again okay so ii ii ii i

don't know

no he's bleeding do we have the disco

yeah big cat got him and the high temple

are dusted said him but i templars fire

so yeah what was that happening no I

should use turd yeah that's bar let me

get something he can turn on/off so

after big cat after big cat attacks him

he turns it on slim goes down yeah

you're use your thing huh yep anyone's

Pavao wow the older flight is looking

really bad yeah

we're slims down it's fire damage yeah

yeah that's one of the blessings of Ajax

is the metal skin it's okay I think yep

well I will use High Templar first then

so 11 Plus 9 is 19 does that get ya who

you're talking extra the yeah yeah 13 +

9 15 + 9 1 into y do it we could hit

someone massive whiff yeah he's swinging

that halberd are yeah yeah it's a good

effort 3d 10 plus 15

okay it's funny that this guy's a node

admirer

huh I think it's funny this guys mean to

fire 3232 damage is dead yes so I just

the wizard left and he's gone all right

just remember that he's gonna summon him

he's gonna scour that way

take off this eldritch night [ __ ]

yeah okay and so then king

[Music]

documents to a shatter Adam so he needs

to make a constitution State against the

dc50 who know the wizard yeah you want

any Intel from this wizard not a wizard

maybe I've got a thing where I can make

well so if they're the ones that got in

here they what does that it's leech

sapphire dragon go now is it me it's you

okay actually what's your what's your

health life Slim's actually down right

now yeah but it's if you can finish her

off and just damage she goes after you

and the man you're summoned creature oh

yeah go ahead

what was that thing that happened really

any bigger than this Bell I lost that

guy's dead though right so I've lost

don't remember I took you took three off

my cause you couldn't concentrate

concentrate Oh correct yes a on those

okay I'm gonna just blast that wizards

but now I think from there I'm not gonna

move and then this sapphire dragon

should probably finish him off yeah so

yes I own these that's 14 and 8 is 20

coming and that's a nine and eight so 17

17 hits

okay so night by fit good yes isn't

shield a reaction

I'm sure to use that rush it's a

personal she's got lots of them yep mmm

so that second one misses oh shoot she

loses her shield oh then I'll just give

boost her I have an improper list of his

about [ __ ] one so full of damage

she's the least healthy of all of them

so even a little bit makes a difference

so now your ally goes yeah thank God you

got off that commander said well yeah is

the right one to cut off his head

sure just cut off somebody's head yeah

his villain ability is really cool too

oh that's well you don't step on his

head to make sure he's dead oh don't eat

them big cat how's it bonus action I

screwed up

Oh rub out where it says dead now yeah

you are you're summoned a lie or reaches

into the mind of the wizard and says

mortal memory is so faulty and tries to

pull some spells out pick your target

mm-hmm-hmm with no say and shot so the

the wizard of the black iron pact steals

her mind and resists the power of the

Sapphire dragon

hmm and the Sapphire dragon is like is

like astonished and and mutters

something under his breath about the

presence of Ajax and then the wizard

goes uh-huh and the wizard pulls out a

small piece of wood and snaps it gone

I'm gonna use this spell break this is

no spell it's not a spell no oh this is

the double

you I mean it's not like something

that's is a magic item

shego would correct said she just

disappeared yeah snapped a shitty

invisible

why would have it van item perception

check against that well it's you can if

you're on a combat so you can go ahead

and take your action if you want it

doesn't she's gone

let's she's got standby as we did it the

High Templar turns to oh yeah and says

concordant our Queen commands me to aid

you and this I have done this world of

yours is pain for us do not ask more of

me for I have no more to give I leave I

say to him I love the lady and I miss

her and when this is all over we should

get a place together and King is a

little bit more also a joke yeah and

you're so fired right again don't leave

me [ __ ] he's gonna he's gonna will

bring slim back yeah zooms up oh yeah

with Fidel for them you Daleks do well

yeah he says our eyes time reader is

slim whose eyes I'm ready

yeah talking about how many points I get

back oh absolutely bring back to full

wow just being his awesome I can

let's see yeah he'll bring you guys back

to full health oh and he wants to talk

to leach it is you have made powerful

ally we have made powerful enemies and

Bala santur axes patience is not

infinite make use of the time she has

given you uh-huh the one's gonna get a

bit longer Alice and tracks that sounds

like a dragon snake if I ever might use

a time I won't if that means oh that's

it look at that everybody lived well

don't be a [ __ ] up about me in the end

lived that was as exhaustive yeah I

think that's probably good places Todd

these guys gonna loot their bodies and

I'll figure out what magic I was

absolutely you don't get the other beat

of force cuz she took that with her

uh-huh

but these these folks they have magic

items and I was in the middle of working

on them and ever had a time so I'm gonna

figure out what their other loot is Suns

also gonna take a trophy off of each one

okay so yeah well they all have grisly

throw of the Ring they all have rings

but you can also take whatever grizzly

trophy you like yeah I wizard got away

I want to peel the flesh off of that

[ __ ] monkey that's interesting whoa

yeah so okay [ __ ] you mom yeah you see

you see slim is this something that you

do with a great sort of your like a

knife no I've got my knife I'm just

thinking for a second like how do you

how do you how do you skin oh that's

right back this limb has the infinite

memory to call upon and you see him

pretty deftly delaying this guy in

peeling the skin off until eventually

he's got these two pieces of what look

like you know uh

treated leather that have jackal tattoos

on them and I'm sort of curious as to

whether or not that is going to prevent

someone else from becoming a master of

jackals then we have to come find you

bring it yeah so what are you what so

where you guys going to do now I'll

investigate the Diamonds to see what was

it something whatever was investigate

this human it was actually in the

diamond judge you yeah he's that he was

in he was the diamond was his was his

prism and as you investigated it from

the diamond crumbles as soon as you

touch it it turns to like it's almost

like mica if you know how like that's

yeah yeah it'll turn to powder but also

you see little flakes of diamond and

it's getting worse as you watch it it's

probably faster yep like you can see a

little little it's already very very

heavily fractured like you can't see

through it the way you would if it were

real solid diamond but the fractures are

increasing over time slowly

is there anything on those guys

noticeably the ward no no they don't

they're not no they're there whatever

they were here for I did not bring one

of the wards with them there's still

that door that sealed right yeah this

fall right that's oh yeah yeah sorry a

Dragonborn paladin walks in and he's

very heavily wounded and bloody and he's

like well who are you thanks watching

everybody

so our friend Tom where you going Tom

not Norway then your family there oh my

dad says family's there so that's why

we're going that's awesome that's just

super cool um wait wait wait stopping on

the way I got a ride game right yeah so

tom is absent and I need a break and so

it's just it's not automatic that if

somebody's not around we don't play but

it was just good timing and this was a

good this is a good break I put a lot of

work into this a matter and also just a

lot of work into the adventures that

we've been having up until now it gives

me a chance to take a break and rest my

thing of whatever needs resting and what

is it trap all the next nonsense so it's

gonna happen so three weeks from now we

will return and we may be here next week

oh we don't know what's gonna happen

maybe somebody Monday one of these fine

people will volunteer to run game one

shot or maybe a two shot since it's two

weeks and if not maybe we'll get the

item flight code names cuz we love that

game and if that doesn't happen I

guarantee you that I will be streaming

some nethack nonsense probably or maybe

some other game okay we like to on card

names today so I don't know what's gonna

happen that's gonna be up to these folks

it'll be mystery so a week from now we

will find out if any of them were brave

enough to step up and say I shall run I

think you know no I don't even know we

were on break

yeah no finding this out for the first

time now so thanks for thanks for

watching everybody this is not the

by any means but I do think after a

battle like this it's gonna give the

players a lot of time to talk about

nonsense

and it'll be a campaign diary and I'll

try to power wait for the campaign diary

to record it's on Monday and I will tell

you folks if you watch the diary all the

stuff that we talked about after this

dream and we often have a D&D lunch and

I will recap that as well thank you for

all the gifted subs thank you for the

support

your presence here is the thing that

gives us hope for the future and let's

asleep at night so until next week

toodle-pip

be seeing you thank you
