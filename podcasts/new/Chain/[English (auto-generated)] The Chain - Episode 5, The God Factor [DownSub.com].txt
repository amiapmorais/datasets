I dreamed I was a god

watching a second youtube channel which

at some point tonight if not on the

YouTube channel people who are just

there for running the game are starting

to feel like holy crap how do I ignore

all these all of these efforts but also

because since the Mac Cobra channel is

my personal channel the one who works

here can do the admin on it so no one

here can do things like oh we want to

put nice thumbnails in or only one of

moderate comments just to make my life a

little bit easier and if we switched it

to a brand channel so they could do that

it would delete all of my comments that

I've made for the past three years on

every video and yes we talked to our

YouTube the partner manager and they

said that is you're correct so we are

starting a second channel the second

channel is gonna have most of the twitch

stuff it'll have instead of it going up

I'm Matt Koval that'll still be running

the game and any kind of directed camera

stuff the second channel will have this

will be archived there we'll go up there

just like it used to on Matt Koval and

stuff like any buildings things we do

will go up there if we do more chain

reaction if you go up there I think Matt

will probably still a little pissed on

twitch

so we'll see we may regret it button

right now I think that's the

organizationally that's the smart thing

to do so that other people who work here

can help with the YouTube channel

instead of just being me is there

anything else we need to talk about blah

blah

so like oh my last we left our heroes

also I want to thank our sponsor still

you that's that's it's it's you this is

[Laughter]

perfect get up off the floor it's a

present from our friend brought to Lars

yeah it's still we don't run ads it's

still on - it should still use

everything we do is support about you

folks if you want to support the channel

if you want more content like this I

encourage you to go by our store and

pick up strongholds and followers which

should still do pretty well and people

seem to like or you can subscribe to our

channel on twitch when you get some we

got some cool emotes and stuff you can

do in twitch chat or you can subscribe

to our patreon we have a subscriber only

channel in our discord that is fun that

people like and these are all just

different ways to support the content

it's up to you actually you just being

here watching is pretty remarkable and

as far as I'm concerned is support

enough so anyway holy crap when last we

left our heroes nails is unconscious

because why what happened yeah yeah his

eyes went back to normal

and he collapsed and now he is

unconscious so and you guys are on the

the heroes the senior officers of the

chain of macron are on the captain's

deck of the somnium to neveress this is

a large purple walled room bright purple

textures with veins - let's let's do me

a favor grab that speaker we had

problems with the audio last time

because yeah I was just my buddy's

telling me that the receipt it was a

little

yeah just stick it somewhere under the

table blimey good night

he says it's better now um I apologize

for people especially people watching on

YouTube because the Bluetooth speaker we

were using to pipe in the music it was

actually closer to our microphones than

we are so we all heard it but you were

way more than you were us whoops

hopefully it's sticking it believe it

below the table will mean that will mean

the we can hear it yeah really here but

not it should be over oh I see it's a

board game

set them on that so let me get let me

make sure that the mods can communicate

with me so yes nails collapses and the

next thing that happens I'm not gonna

call for initiative yet the next thing

that happens is undead red PCC yeah we

should put some boxing circuit silly

boxes about a galaxy traffic uh the next

thing that happens is red this is red

right uh-huh

red turns and vaporizes a streak

attacking oh my how the red is you

recognize and he's still wearing the

outfit that the commander war but his

body has been ripped apart his skin is

now green and he turns and like he howls

at these at these so then whoever is

left still watching just so you know we

have somebody who volunteered not

volunteer pay for came down to help us

with our audio so that we sound good

tonight

hmm but it was my idea huh this is yet

again usually when there was a battle up

it's because of me there was my idea to

have

last minute to have Tom sit behind the

screen and open the stream as Omega

nails and I was like I don't have the

setup I had last week I took everything

home can we just do it in reverb in the

DA and Chris was like yeah sure so of

course it was after fall and Chris has

been down here earlier in the week he

was down here earlier today just to make

us sound good

tonight and it was my stupid idea to put

reverb on Tom's voice that caused

everything to go to crap somewhat

typically crap yeah so Chris and Jerry

have apparently unfucked everything and

so yeah the the those of you joining us

who could only hear our garbled noise we

flapped our meat together I was

describing I was describing the room

some people get that I was describing

the room this being that's very brightly

very bright purple wall is up here thin

illuminated pink veins that pulse was

some kind of white fluid running through

them and red undead red turns to the

three genuki who I believe were feared

and he howls at them his face pulls back

and reveals this sort of like demonic

entity within and that visit the site of

that bitch's visit causes the three gift

to like be blown away they aren't

disintegrated and turned to ash so

that's what that's what undead read does

what do you books do damn nails is

unconscious okay all right well who has

by the way who has the romp absorbs I do

okay okay so I've got the wrong

absorption and then you need that right

so are we treating this like a

traditional combat round right only so

no I know what you guys are gonna do

okay so I want to definitely toss the

rod over to King okay so do you can do

that judge throws the rod of absorption

King roll detent okay detail mm-hmm

the right downrod absorbs on your

character she too they has five charges

yes three the 3 charges absorb from the

fireball plus the one d-10 that is

supposed to start and then judge I'm

gonna turn to sweet mm-hmm I'm gonna

pull out the red arrow say you know you

got to do what does sweet do sweet takes

the red arrow all right so basically

sweet is going to sort of lean down over

nails nails unconscious more unconscious

form it's gonna sort of lift him up give

him body hug and whisper in his ear well

he's unconscious right now that's not

gonna do anything oh really

no do you want to wake up what's up

to you if you want to try to if you want

to spend in action or whatever I'm not

super worried about initiative or

actions right now if you want to spend

your your time trying to wake him up no

all right just gonna just just come to

ya sorry buddy okay his eyes shoot

before you were able to plunge the

dagger into his bat you're holding him

into his back his view could you

probably can't see this then but the

rest of you watching see Onegin nails

his eyes open and his eyes are silver

and your hand stops it physically is

unable to plunge into his back and

normal nails his voice comes out and he

says I dreamed I was a god why why do

humans have so many gods it was only

have one the doors only have one

but we have hundreds I wonder if Ajax

nodes and then he continued speaking is

'old monologue but now his voice is

booming and echoing and now this is the

Omega nails voice that you would

normally hear in your head and he looks

at you and says you should have killed

me while you had the chance

yeah I should've like you killed us all

and elk are you'll find I am not so

easily fooled would you like to meet

them again I can bring them back - no

that's all right sweet can you say his

name I mean I'm assuming that I used my

a turn or whatever tell me when I when

and if I can do stuff you can go you can

do what you want alright so now I mean I

am I still sort of like yeah you know

hugging him alright now I'll say I know

you Duran Aaron Hart

sorry buddy would you say when you speak

his name

hmm his eyes go back to being normal

nails and he gasps and looks at King and

says King don't trust them and then you

plunge the arrow in any howls and there

is this explosion of opalescent energy

that erupts out of his body and it rips

nails apart

it's like it's this thing that was

infusing every cell in his body and the

the arrows that I'll call the red arrow

you plunge it into him and it releases

all this energy and it just rips through

nails and and it obliterates nails

cheese and sweet sweet sweet holding

onto nails as nails erupts and dies this

this wave of energy and it rushes out

through the rest of the room it

vaporizes sweet and sweet looks probably

surprised I would imagine

yeah I would imagine and I think oh and

then one day I read that belongs to me

Powell's and and some know and screams

out in this portal opens underneath him

and you see this like this this guy's

reaches up through the board level Krabs

reaches up through the portal and grabs

undead red and pulls him back down into

the abyss Daniel so now there are so

filthy what are you doing tom there are

now three members of the chain of after

huh at this point the elevator doors

open and two figures emerge from the

elevator you recognize both of them it's

boots and two shoes and boots says my

friends I'm so glad you're not dead

sorry it's boots enter 6-ton right now

so I'm sorry sir Duke happens to

everybody so Tom you can get back on top

I'm sure Jeremy will tell ya something

go grab Tom I love nobodies the second

character is behind every time well

that's an ex multiple of us to have dead

characters on all day

yeah just evil I think it's gonna be a

while before oh is this your curricular

esit instead I may have misread create

obliterated because I'd like to

confiscate that I do oh that's right

King

guess what King I am the captain now you

just got a feel promotion King is now

king is now because he was deluded

because sweet chose him to be lieutenant

according to the according to The

Chronicle

even though King was a junior officer

it's really like three days every King

is now the commander he's the commander

he's still the Chronicle but he cannot

be the lieutenant you can't get the dope

you can't once you're the commander you

cannot you no longer gain the benefit of

the and one of your jobs is going to eat

up here right now you don't have to do

it today in terms of game time but

something you're gonna have to decipher

do quickly is who the next who the next

lieutenant is going out or failing or

the string what pretty quickly like on

the scribe to shoes and boots came out

of the elevator and boots said my

friends I'm so glad you're not dead

so you're you're you're you recognized

my boots is Jesus so I mean you know

boots is real and and they're not gonna

get super hung up on ginger stuff but I

believe boots is a boy but I don't have

I don't have that many it's a great

dueling doulas buns for a duelist a real

and duelist but welcome at some point

there'll be ceremony or whatever but

welcome to the senior officer court so

yeah what do you guys do ship falling

apart

it does list a little bit when nails

dies but then it writes itself

the ship's not falling apart it is dying

like a minute to process the death of

our to move can you process while you're

right yeah I knew a lot about how this

game is gonna go guess how many

prisoners I well I I think we we passed

a a level a few levels down for me that

did look like some somewhat of like a

break but we just kept pressing buttons

in the in the things until we found you

guys I'm so pleased about that

[Music]

are there any pieces of yes what does OK

worse worse sweet and Wales right here

and there and there in there there's a

like nails and nails and sweet were both

annihilated basically you wash them okay

kind of you watch the light the vocalist

of energy that had infused in a nails or

if you pardon so there's nothing okay

can use the commander now what about

sweet hat yeah I'm laying over in the

corner yes sweetie there is a prisoner

deck that is one deck below this dude of

copper where's that yeah okay cigarette

okay I apologize to all the people who

find missed of yeah of trying to sweet

surrounds you I apologize to all the

people who did all that awesome fan on

for characters it just got annihilated

all don't worry we I mean let's face it

we I think we all came in tonight

thinking that there's a very good chance

that something like this would happen so

that in fact that I think both of us

have backup characters and they just

amazed

at such an occasion is this why you're

watching like there's this this is this

is exactly the same thing that would

happen if we weren't streaming yeah in

the sense that I try to keep even when

even when players are conspiring with me

regarding the future of their character

I try to keep it from the other players

so that they are surprised just a

preserve a suspension of disbelief in

worship there's no other plan was any

way our plan was to stab them with

arrows there are built into the walls

behind the to the left on the right of

the command chair there are like drawers

like this let's search the drawers

[Music]

I think we should make haste with the

searching there is quite a interesting

aroma in this search interesting we

killed my witness bracket you want to

kill the - it doesn't do anything it has

no pilot well as far scuttling the ship

right I think this ship is going itself

I mean don't forget the like right you

were that was an order that came from

something that doesn't work with you

that was just what captain mastcam

wanted well

this ship potentially could have really

 us up and we don't need to ejects

having this thing at the end of the day

Ajax is our ultimate enemy right so I

think we trashed the ship so if he

doesn't get it we can't do anything with

it unless you want to put your head in

the suction cup I wanna get off the ship

this is where the the eluded captain

kept the treasure like the best the best

pickings of the loot that they had

confiscated as they pirated their way

across the time scape thanks so there's

a total game copper or silver gold

platinum there's a total of six hundred

sixty gold aces nice there's a book

written in the common language that it

is the history of some hit Garen noble

family looks old

it's worked wipeout gold there's a liar

as a silver liar it's worth 30 there's a

there's a device that you don't that

you're no you're none of your characters

recognize but your player you guys would

recognize it instantly it looks like

some of you guys have seen in spy

glasses

that's not incredibly common technology

that exists but it looks like if you

took a spyglass and shrunk it down I

mean it this big

I put it on a stand microscope that's

one roll

this is Trevor so I don't know yeah

there's a book of fairytales

that's worth 25 gold comet large right

now if you open up and look at it there

they are there's a table yeah they're

fairy tales in that they were the tales

that fairies tell them arguments there's

a set of navigators tools that's awful

there are pieces of black Jasper or

fifty gold pieces each there's two

pieces of blue Jasper worth fifty gold

pieces each is a proper old-school

dealer how much does the black Jasper's

the black Jasper's four pieces each were

difficult

my friend Brian says five pages of back

story now splattered in this room yeah

you guys have access to like true

resurrection living you can just true

resurrections I think it's a nine-hole

spell and you can just say I wish the

fisherman Franklin was back alive

you don't have to have any bits of or

anything so I know he's okay I could say

not don't it don't try that when you're

when your friend has been eaten by a

demon you might get you might come back

you might come back but just not as a

team it looks like Kyle says looks like

being commander for the chain is sort of

like being the drummer and spotl down

there was more economy where Kenny in

South Park yeah yeah yeah how do you

dust for vomit uh there's a there's a

large well it's actually technically

meeting there's a medium-sized crystal

that globes and hums very softly and it

has this like rainbow color throughout

it I know what that is neat

Mars no sadness there is two potions

healing oh yeah oh we've got to

take questions healing off nails body

yeah and so the belt evil giant strength

Oh No say goodbye that necklace the

fireballs gone basically all the best

magic you guys there's dose potions of

healing

I think mean culprit should drink both

of those right now okay I have three

health yeah no okay so yeah don't write

those down just mark them off do you

guys know how potions healing work to do

run a greater healing use the bonus then

look I mean I could I could burn my last

balls

potions a layer under c4 cure there is a

small it's actually kind of this shaped

you know what gemstone that's in a

special to be for pesky come on now

there's also a bag there's a bag it's

unlike it's a large bag that if you open

it up has a bag of dicks dozens of tiny

dicks has dozens of these blood-red

stones that are flat on the bottom and

then curved on the time how big are the

stats they're they're like there are

various sizes some of them are this big

some of them are really small well like

that big there's a whole bag of them

they're all very smooth red smooth red

blood red yeah but you guys don't have a

wizard

she has identified yeah 24 plus two is

that worse is that what that does is up

to poaching Lina's yes sorry I look

sweets ghost

told me in the psychic wind yes sweet

speaks to me through it tells me what to

do some sweet nothings yeah so yeah

you've got a bunch of cash a bunch of

non magical items and then a bunch of

weird

unidentified thingies all right so let's

go down and see you can you find the

prisoners yeah yes it's the I think it's

did that for my blows you remember boots

as being basically like any other return

right now he seems a lot more capable

yeah almost as though he's like a couple

of levels

so yeah the the level below blow down

from here one down is the command deck

which you guys you folks a picture

before and it's larger than this one

it's got a large opalescent pool of

liquid in it that's like a waist height

and then other than that's got a bunch

of debt door on it and you cross that

room and take the elevator down one

level from there and you are in what

it's like a long corridor with doorways

barns like intersecting Martha grids of

bars going down it looks like there's 12

on each side than there are doors at the

end mm-hmm this work boots thought that

the prisoners right there prisoners okay

so yeah we're gonna go Don alloy and

check out each of the cells

and see if you can find any that are by

the way as a reminder of Health site

which gives me advantage on anybody who

might be like invisible or hidden that's

good to know it's good for me to know

you notice the spirit of sweet following

around this week

what's that Benji

I saved my buddy that's true the first

two cells and they do appear to be like

cells are empty and then the first one

on the left there is a figure sitting in

it there's a cot there's what looks like

a place for somebody to there's like

this thing at this place has like indoor

plumbing but the plumbing are all like

organic orifices yeah okay and yeah

there was a figure sitting on the

mention hey you take the lead on this

one King sitting on the medieval standby

he said there's somebody sitting on the

cop missing their weapons

nobody armor they're just working around

but in the cell is this gentleman player

it's like a worry like that

chat wants to know where your duelist

classes from ah we Matt and I sort of

hastily assembled it out of just a base

rogue with the Senators wife buckler

rules and then I found a homebrew

swashbuckler that was like a fighter a

fighter based class and so we basically

just like transplant at some of the

parts

from that fighter class into the parts

of the road class and throughout like we

transplanted parts that make boots sort

of a swashbuckling sword master duelist

type of guy and throughout the bits that

are like the you know intelligence and

sneaking and specifically I think we

killed the rogues movement ability kind

of actually killed cutting action and

replaced it with something that makes

your swashbuckler a little bit like a

battle master it's not actually a battle

master you don't have battle master

maneuvers that he has this gives the

phone like swashbuckler maneuvers city

has to spend panache I think they're

called swash points with a shackle a

match yeah yep because a charisma based

rope everything like swashy such and

such yeah so these were cool and Tom

liked amazed like I have this class but

specifically these this one ability

Brian I was like sure but this is pretty

cool so we have to kill something that's

super useful for the road in order to

stick it in there and the thing that was

the most useful and level-appropriate

was his extra movement so he doesn't

have the extra movement at her okay so

if you're watching like I understand why

nails why boots doesn't do his cutting

action to the cadets it's because he

doesn't by the way being Tom Tom being a

rope it feels like everything's right in

the world now so yeah there's Anna lipid

that is sitting kind of like hunched

over watching you can see his tentacles

kind of writhing so he's talking I'll

talk to him you're there be you friend

or foe

well that depends on you and you hear

this voice in your mind you guys can all

hear uh-huh

those again I imagine foe

I imagine he's got the bread let's look

at it oh if I were a better Dungeon

Master I would recorded all his dialogue

just be pressing buttons and I'm pretty

yes feels better do you mind if I turn

around and I say I think this one's no

good

Charlie go tap done

soap that's true it's up to you guys

some you guys own a elephant difference

now you're not gonna cool I don't think

anyone's gonna accept an elephant coming

into the City the pretty sketch

they're pretty do you walk up and eat

people's brains public your voice in

your head say I haven't eaten anyone's

brain in hours is there any obvious

mechanism on the door is on how to open

them hmm as judge looks around you hear

this kind of laughter and the elephant

sits back and he's like of course you

don't know how anything works this is

your ship how'd you end up in prison yes

I wasn't in charge I was in prison for

arguing to spare a prisoner

what prisoner oh I think she's still

here they wanted to kill her I wanted to

torture her slowly why I thought it

might yield interesting ingredients

ingredients I called the ship master a

fool

this is my punishment you deserved it

let's keep walking

freeing me would be madness free me did

you all move honor does only Java I'm

gonna start walking let's find this

other prison off King yeah that's true

they might be connected so we could do

the other two cells down on the rights

this was on the left so cells down the

right there is a woman she's wearing a

simple linen outfit and she was short

blue hair and she has like teal skin

does she look human she's humanoid yeah

yeah yeah she looks like a human just

very weirdly colored from I mean to my

second point I mean from Joe's pointy

nose with the normal range of human

colors are but every once in a while

anything she's eager like when she sees

you she sits up and and you see every

once in a while like ripples of almost

like a chameleon changing color or like

a like a cuttlefish the the way there

the way the texture of their skin

changes except it's almost like a wave

like white like white waves washing

across her face who are you who are you

we're on the outside the bars yeah

nothing on the cage so you start what do

you wish to know what do you aim for but

I was captured I wish my name yes

how do I know I can trust you you don't

but we're not the people who imprisoned

you so who are you she kind of backs

away from the bars all right I think I'm

gonna talk to her King last thing mal

said to me was I know your instinct is

gonna be to 100% stood up but he's cool

why's it why would nails tell me not to

trustee thing that nobody's going to

trust because it's a sketchy anything

yeah so so happy little fish girl yeah

fish girl he's a cuttlefish got feet she

doesn't have gills

what did what what if she's the bad one

[Laughter]

the ship safely yeah so we're trying to

got the do you want out

at what price what do I have to do you

just have to tell us why you're in here

and tell us your name we were captured I

am I am as allowed several of us would

like you know great from I was born in

Kubrick it's a give you know where that

is it's a city it's a city in the plane

of quintessence mmm

what would judge know about Kubrick it's

it's it's cute see you pric it means it

means like like something made of copper

it's a city in quintessence it's not the

capital city it's like it's not it's

like Chicago compared to New Yorker it's

a big city

do they know what this person is yeah

judge

I think she's um or know it's like it's

called a judge is like ah that's right

it's right I mean ya know you protect

yours probably knows better than Anna

does it sound accidently it's a water

cannot see okay that's what was no Nate

and I were traveling to a city in the

mundane world and then then this ship

came this okay in the mundane world

that's like so I think the most

important question is this are you with

her against Ajax who's Ajax can I do it

inside role yeah sure what he trying to

incite just in general like is she mean

shifty or whatever the case is so bad

can't read people no one can read that

da you could just make up a number H

yeah she she definitely seems like well

yeah I mean I should roll that we have

to remember in order for to 1 so ya know

I mean she you don't get a rich she's

just seemed scared okay she seems scared

and he can't get a read off her because

of that what do you know about the mind

fighter in themselves a couple I know

that he's the one that killed my my mate

and when they wanted to kill me he said

no but I didn't know why I and she looks

she's like her eyes are darting over

there she doesn't have exactly eyesight

to where it's Ella's but she knows he's

over there I think you wanted to harvest

something of mine hmm

what did it's a nice judge to know about

water canaussie in general I mean

they're just there they're from judgment

point of view they are just another

ethnicity that you run across in

quintessence okay I wasn't sure if they

retain specific they are native they're

like unlike tea flings they are native

to intestines I only can I see her

native jerk adjustments whereas tea

things are actually that native to I

think they're actually native to one

specific City in him nothing neat what

oh no I was just

I looked up Ganassi yeah to see what

they're like somewhere somewhere in

their ancestry there was an elemental

Hey so yeah sweetie aren't you about

this you're leavin both she's looking

she looked down there was other so that

might hurt the my player is down there

and she can't see it but everyone smiles

she sticks her head out and looks down

mmm if you got out of here what would

you do I don't know I don't know the

woman I loved is dead I have nothing I

have nowhere to go I suppose I would try

to get to I would try to get the cabin

I've only heard of mermaids and stories

but I know they're not to be trusted

what yeah maybe yeah with the UH

sometimes you have a person you need

their brain to be this could be a useful

skill

philosophy's Alchemist he can harvest

things as much more useful than whatever

that is I was a gardener yeah I think

the alchemist is that she's an herbalist

bro

there he is she well we kiss and then

just judge Allah and you just love no

come on Hannah likes it too

it's pretty fun Thomasina reason not to

let her out we don't need to take her

along but until it run so far you guys

don't have to seem you don't know you

guys there don't appear to be any

mechanisms that would open these have

you guys done anything more than like

just stand on the other side of the bars

I've talked to these people you have

tried to interact physically no we do

have the my flare hand there's no

there's nothing that my players gonna

love you if you walk around ok so I

guess let's fur to you this on this one

King what do you want to do I won't look

for there's any kind of mechanism to

open the store yeah well it's probably

all my everything thus far has been mine

powered yet so glad if you want it

I think about it to see if it opens does

it open

you think of the wall while flailing the

my know what do you guys do with that

I guess we're carrying in it yeah is

that what I mean we're carrying yes I

have the navigated tools I just drunk

now I did yeah okay cross them off right

there on their crossbow all right or

just put an arrow same pop I just wanted

the microscope that's all I would I have

the gemstone in the pouch and the bag of

blood stones and the are in Noble book

you could probably use a crystal ah yeah

okay like do you think the gym not the

density's no I mean the crystals

cuz there's two crystals right there's

one that was all rainbow colored there's

one that's literally like this that's

the one that one exactly video do we see

anywhere where we could put that gem

yeah which one but I mean I know what

the big one is but no no when you're

holding it and looking around you do

feel as though like your field of view

is wider

that was one for coming to fob Slater

there's another one this is some super

nerdy video game developer jokes

oh we couldn't afford something in

the in the hold called a feature creep

[Laughter]

oh my god oh my do I need to make a

future creep monster that's cool yeah

so anyway ya know so yeah I'm happy it

can't be mine power because why wouldn't

he just be able open it then

he's waiting we're only the crystal that

first up oh I forgot mine clear the my

employer has a car yes

cool cool yeah he's got it's a round

it's actually quite morning it's made

out of like ceramic and

does it but it looks like like almost

like a restraint of cement like it's

it's not obviously nothing doesn't like

myself that's exactly there's no kind of

lock that we see anywhere anything let's

just solid solid bars that we can't do

anything about well I mean are all the

cells around us also a lot like that

they're all closed

well you haven't there's there's a whole

bunch more down Lee

oh my god they're on either side if

there are it's a corridor oh you guys

you guys really got like two there's one

behind it's like it's more like well

maybe we just try it on that one try

something that when to see if it works

before we absolutely let somebody loose

so maybe we don't want to I'm gonna kind

of just like I delete poke one of the

bars just kind of like you can't you

can't know in what manner can't I do

your finger your finger uh hits an

invisible barrier oh hey look it's on

this side of bars but they can reach out

okay

well let's check out the other there

might be like something at the far end

you like the control panel for

everything

although I don't think we're in a spot

to fight mind player though yeah

can I see that crystal I do but he has

the that lovely cravat that might be in

I mean like a monkey who uses a prop

did King give it to me judge asks to see

thee the thing Thanks

here are the same experience when you

hold in your hand you have this weird

sensation also you feel like like you

are your hell sight is more cute my

hillside is more cute interesting so

better than advantage mMmmm hang on to

this for me my health a is more cute

well you can I'm fine Nestor all right

let's keep investigating the thing and

see if we can figure out how to open it

and stuff and then decide we want to let

out what does keep investigating the

thing the channel whatever it's stockade

whatever you want to call it the bridge

this is the bridge

okay very good okay in other words I'm

just asking are you still trying to

figure out how to open the door or

you're going to investigate you

themselves

well you said there's no any kind of

mechanism or anything he's an invisible

wall so we're saying if there's any kind

of control panel like the things that

were for the elevator I think to the

mind flayer so I'm like alright so you

want to go in here how do you open these

doors what would this guy

say I'm sure he's got something sassy

come on lay it on me I have no means to

escape you'd have no means to escape no

I assume you don't either if you do you

don't know it well what do you need to

escape I would need certain assurances

from you

well isn't getting out enough I mean it

depends on what happens once he gets out

well mercenary company on our way to

capital Brock just said Jesus has being

the commander like being the journalist

[Laughter]

I'm not particularly interested in

walking out of the cell and then being

cut down well we're not that interested

in cutting anybody down right now

really do you speak for everyone I speak

for myself yeah well what a coincidence

I also speak for myself like I said we

don't have that means to fight them

right now

and so you'll figure it out or you won't

it doesn't matter to me at this rate

it's probably leaning towards the latter

but if I can convince them be great to

have you guys join us you seem a lot

more capable than the water gun ah see

[Music]

I'm sure she's very capable it's growing

things my body do you think her pineal

gland mm-hmm would be worth quite a lot

how does it taste it's a disgusting

question are we gonna make a deal with a

mind flayer huh I'm gonna make a deal

with a mind flayer just like this let me

just like this alright but we're gonna

leave both out and you're not going to

harvest thee yeah no I wouldn't dream of

it

well would you dream up what do my

players dream like our experience with

my players is not very good so I have

the same dream as anyone else does when

I dream about your organs what you would

look like without flesh we need somebody

to bargain with you have no way to open

the doors we have this eye flap the hand

Anna I judged you harshly you do have

the mind of a mind flare that should

have been mine it's a good line I wonder

who did you take that from he starts

naming people

are there anymore is there anyone left

alive on the ship not that we know of

definitely not my players well they

should have listened to me what the

going rate you're going to die in the

cell below cuz we're getting out of here

so I mean you actually have no way to

open as far as he knows he open so I

mean he could communicate that with us

he didn't said he said he said there's

no he said you have no way to open the

cell and if you do have it you don't

know you have it okay here's here's the

thing that was like he wants assurances

from us that we're not gonna like

whenever he comes out so and everybody's

okay

that's us letting out mister mind player

I think you might give us a clue to let

us know if we either have the thing to

open these cells or where to find it so

what's the deal guys he wants my player

out or what this is a mind player that

other mind flayers put in this cell or

is he this guy's too extreme it's okay

love brains just don't if he loves the

right kind of brains anyway there's a

whole bunch more cells to and there's a

door at the end of the corner okay well

alright well we're gonna I'm gonna go

down the cells I don't know if anybody

wants to go with me check the other ones

yeah we know we know that there were two

prisoners we found two prisoners but we

don't know if the mine player was

incorporated in those prisoners so let's

check the results

and is there anything yeah there's um

there's a tall like you know fully a

head taller than the tallest person

company lanky bony creature that you

recognize as again and it's kind of like

I want somewhere I'm looking for it's

got like one leg cocked up on the cot

and it's resting its back on just kind

of idly sitting there kind of like Han

Solo with the cantina yeah who's the

Isaac are you the person who's like the

lead blocker the first person yeah when

as soon as you walk into view he like

sits up like he's excited there's

somebody here who are you mine do I have

a gift face you had one last week I

don't remember he says who are you what

are you all doing here

we're checking for prisoners any as you

guys all gather around

he sort of sits up on an accountant as

this kind of like institution attitude

and he's like wait wait I recognize

those uniforms the chain of Acheron I

remember you I used to think you were

fools following a contract ink and paper

and then you betrayed the lady of brass

and I love you we didn't betray the

Lydia brass he says you did mmm the

story I read well I mean after you know

the story that's not the story how much

dude how much does King know about why

the why the chain of a crown stopped

working for the lady rats though the

city fell there was no more City but

why'd that happen because she didn't

listen to us correct certain when she

was a fool she should have listened to

you he stands up he's like if he asks

what happened to the mind flayers

there's one in the cage no I mean the

ones on the bridge the ones who run the

ship they're dead the other gifts that

were up there are dead too

[Music]

that's right - you would know that he

would know that because he remembers he

was bad so yeah he's asking about the

other gift then you're like they all

they're good they're dead and I think at

that point bill can take over okay

so what do you say you that guys let me

out of here I can help you notice how

well I know how to I know how to pilot

this ship I have some information that

might be able to help you but first

question why are you in here they walk

these other two uh you know they're the

captain uh no I didn't get along I think

I said seems to be a common yeah oh the

captain was a fool see Italy a common

thing in a weeks old

do you know how to open the gates

yes yeah he did oh that's useful how do

you say he has a weak soul because he is

following Ajax yeah how do you feel

about Ajax nobody's slave the being like

that doesn't have allies only slaves hmm

are you interested in joining a

mercenary company as a free gift well I

mean I I don't have anything better to

do sitting in this cage is kind of

boring and you didn't recognize you guys

a lot about you guys you know I kind of

would like to know the truth of the

chain you know whether all the rumors

are true yeah

we are yes thing it seems to me if we

leave him here and we leave this ship

crumbles and sinks to the Astra sea

we never see it again we free him and he

is who he says he is and you can pilot

the ship never little let's do it

and how do we get you out you need the

command rod that's the they didn't know

didn't ya didn't know that it was also

in addition to the rod of absorption

it's thing that commands it's so the you

and you touch that you actually just

have to think about it the force field

drops in the doors oh you thought about

a whole wrong welding that's okay and he

didn't have the commander on you didn't

know what it did so welcome to the chain

yours has a downside are you like what

is it oh okay so you yeah always yes or

just whenever I'm piloting this you know

always okay all right

the pilot has a psychic link to the

somnium tenebrous the navigator can

relay messages to me physic psychically

across any distance you gain magic

resistance but this doesn't work on

psychic abilities but he has a

vulnerability to psychic damage yeah

connection the connection with your

connection with the ship just makes it

so that like your brain is operating on

this one wavelength and if other people

use psionic abilities against you it's

like it's it's crazy sympathetic

vibrations but magic resistance means

that I believe it's either you get

advantage on saves against spells or you

take half damage from spell damage I

don't remember which mmm

okay I know I knew a few months ago and

I have not dealt with it since that meet

so yeah on the money so the magic

obviously magic is a lot more common

than psychic abilities so that's usually

nine times out of ten probably more than

that it's it's going to be a huge bonus

being having magic resistance so if all

my ability means it takes double double

damage from that so in other words if

like a mind player tried to zap you and

succeeded and don't so yeah you would

take a lot of damage okay

it means advantage on saved Chad says

that man John says and it was higher B

it was in fact okay

well I guess let's go just to use me

thus breaking gadgets means are you

making saves against spells you roll

advantage oh nice yeah do you know

what's up for these other two down here

have you seen them that's not results

being gift by the way that's a result of

your connection it's like it's like

you're you now kind of get the benefit

of being more than just one organism

you're also sort of linked to this huge

squid ship you can join us but you have

to wear a hat we've got this hatch I

think you did you've made you made a

good decision so much good only troops

what do you know about the other people

in here what do I know about the other

people in there I know you know I don't

know and I know you can never trust a

mind flayer before we voice Mary I'd say

it's not true we should read that one to

the ship Oh

see can't you see all the yeah I mean

it's the ships dying you defeated

[Music]

where is it smells is it up in the

pilots with all no it's bull it would be

like below the water level it's like

exposed to that compost it's like those

beak of there are there are places on

the ship where you can bit like there

are pools that you can drop protein into

and the ship will process it like a food

but it would be like a Mayan flavor

would be like once you know this ship me

it's like oh wow responsibility do we

want to fish if I don't think we should

say my fire we could feed the my flare

to it but the other one I don't know

yeah you I think you majorly I don't

trust the right from nails I'm kind of

sketched out about the Ted Tim and

seeming like you haven't don't know

anymore about the mind flare or the

cannot say than they supposed to because

that mind flare was put down here like

well before your mutiny and he was he

was are down here as a prisoner I had of

kind he had its own little moment of

disagreeing with his captain right and

then then you were there when your guys

took over and kill all of my players

right and you were just like well let's

leave him alive it will get around to

kill this guy later he might he might

know something

mm-hmm I mean make sure to assume you're

gonna kill at some point but right when

the ship isn't sinking we could go back

and deal with other guys or something

yep oh well and we need to go get the

chain on here because we're gonna

through the mine thing to move the boat

I said no unless we need a crew can you

move here and all these tentacles and

stuff too in probably shouldn't does my

eye know anything about the Ganassi know

she was there before she's a she's a

she's a just I mean you were a slave

like the gift and the doís girl were

slaves to the mind flayers

and so they would basically do to other

ships what they tried to do to the Ross

asean and she was one of many passengers

that they kind of hung on to and they

fed a lot of them to the they plunder

they killed they fed a lot of them to

the ship and they kept a couple of them

for valuable reasons right and she was

one of them catch him Mike mindfully

mind flayers sometimes view other living

creatures as bags of ingredients in

psycho will just boil this one down and

harvest their pineal gland or their

spleen because we can sell it to the

drow for you know all that kind of

slavers to or thing to the my players

yeah well that's how the gift and the

dog are here in the astral sea or both

slaves to the tradition slaves to the my

video living bill people I know yeah

what are you what your character's name

is so my name is de gellick they call me

the impious it's a lot of story it's a

bit of a mouthful Joe what should Jim

call you

I don't know what would you call me Joey

besides my name did you read the tall

fellow I mean none of us go by our real

names here

it's called slim you never I mean

there's a picture of him right behind

Phil oh yeah yeah kinda I mean that's a

that's a 19th very even a very 19h

persian of oh boy your character what

might it look like yeah now he's a he's

a battle master fighter yeah no no one

died the dramatic yeah the dramatic

setup they do are the fourth edition or

fifth edition are for them looks really

 yeah

so yeah this

you know I mean he's he's about six and

a half feet tall

yes slim tall kind of bony claim call it

looks he's got the typical sort of v

Yankee look black hair black eyes that

sort of ochre color skin skin all right

well let's get him up to the pilot's

seat

let's go get some of the chain over here

and like masking him know that we're all

on the mount and this is our ship now

let's go I assume that everyone

introduces themselves to to whatever you

guys decide to call this guy on the way

up yeah who's gonna start calling slim

yeah very slim some fun until the girl

sticks yeah yeah but it's a little

obscure and I don't I mean I think I

think for that one to work it would have

to come like a lot further down the line

I mean we didn't know it yeah like slim

just because it's a reference to a

character that I really like from the

game yeah so whenever we get new

recruits is there a process for us for

the chain of how we like add them to the

company are you talking accrued

specifically or are you talking about

like some pcs are we talking about

growing the army but is the chain of

Akron yeah like growing army for example

like whenever we recruit new folks in or

whatever

do they have to like sign into the

Chronicle yeah their names are put in

The Chronicle but they also have to

swear an oath mm-hmm and it's pretty

simple it's just like I sorta but though

I sort of I swear to follow the contract

obey the officers and put the chain

before anyone else and it's that put the

chain before anyone else but some small

text and I get to clean up after big cat

yeah a sister

nobody has to doesn't mean and also you

have to feed my cat now it's good but

it's that and put the chamber everybody

else think it becomes kind of like a

test and it's up to you go it's up to

usually the it depends on who it is I

did junior officers can sometimes take

care of this

sometimes if this person is obviously

like something like a gift

Battlemaster

what you guys would probably have to

take care of and make sure the test is

just are you are you bringing your

problems with you like no one joins the

chain if they have unfinished business

and sometimes people sometimes people

Bluff and they end up in the chain and

then all of a sudden there's some local

Noble who this person slept with the

nobles significant other and now that

for some reason people are pissed at the

chain and the officers like what the

hell's going on its iOS cuz this

you know failed to cut all his ties

right so that's that's usually what is

this making sure that there's no

unfinished business well the upside is

that it looks like you guys cut those

ties for me just great I like it's good

yeah I'm just getting kind of bored with

those guys anyways sorry I mean there's

there's there's two ways to get to grow

the chain one is to just like if you

guys go to capital and do nothing the

chain will probably grow just because

old members of the chain in black bottom

who couldn't get on the boat will arrive

so slowly over time you'll you'll start

seeing old soldiers report in and then

also depending on your deeds the stuff

you do and how how the city reacts which

is largely gonna be up to chat in future

like every once in a while if you guys

do something extraordinary

then people will want to join the chain

and then your units will grow y'all I

get either get new units or the unit you

have will increase its a casualty die

and then the other way is to just

roleplay meaning NPCs and they become

routines like if like when you meet like

this this

I'm him well he's still your take he

still he still the chains retain right

yeah but yeah you you meet this you meet

business you meet this cool you meet

this cool Appling of halfling assassin

and you roleplay the act of recruiting

that person just like you would recruit

any NBC just like so bono did with with

Caitlyn with his with his squire right

and then if it goes well then you end up

with a new meeting and we kind of skip

that process and that was the user

charisma modifier but normally there's

really no limit to the number of

retainers you can have other than what I

think is reasonable based on the NPC's I

put in front of you and the the

role-playing you okay well while we walk

out of here pointed the gun side and say

we'll talk to you later but when we

don't buy the mind phone say nice chance

I hold the rod wave it at them and walk

by surprise something with so many bones

has room for a brain talking you're

gonna feed the beast when your Wi-Fi is

coming what judge feels nothing yeah

it's just just look at the wrong people

I mean the Bremen lady seems you're the

one who said don't trust him in New Year

but I mean look at it what possible harm

could it do that like a hold my beer

statement I mean it's not a warrior as

long what you say what kind of harm

could you do us why would I why would I

do anybody harm I think she's good all

right come on return with us where are

we going to capital they taking me

you're taking me to capital no we're

going to capital and you're coming with

us

I'm confused she says he's not an escort

mission where does it want to go capital

she was gonna capital she was leaving

where she was going with this famous

city in the mundane world path I said

come on blue blue actually it's I guess

we can just check that room later at the

end of the thing it's just more brief

nose knows the ship right I mean you

would just say oh that's yep oh that's

yeah you mean you you served on this

ship as a slave for a some number of

like at least months so yeah you know

the ship in fact in fact I'm sorry

unfortunately that floor plane has a

grid printed on it which makes it really

hard to actually see what the hell's

going on so it's cool it's cool there's

a grid printed on it it makes it useful

for a tactical maps and stuff but it

actually makes it somewhat difficult to

figure out with the exponent so do me a

favor and just lay it on the Dungeon

Master's guide because people and that

way Jerry oh right that way that way

Jerry can kind of zoom in on it maybe a

little bit and people can see because I

do not unfortunately I think if you just

look up you let that dreadknot

online you'll find the same I slaved

over Google for minutes okay

we gotta we gotta paint those flags by

the way the there are Sables the sails

are designed to catch the psychic wind

and the sails currently I've painted on

them in blood a jack system close it

down do you know how to get out of the s

we'll see do I sure yeah you can come in

the Navigator do that mm-hmm okay we

should then let's go on the other ship

get the chain over here

mething ham that she is free from all

this you guys are currently basically

docked with the others like a gang is a

gangplank that has been put between the

two ships still have people to water

packing for them takes on so I'm gonna

whenever we get out onto the we're

moving up to the top deck now

to get out onto the gangplank so I think

whenever we get up there and we can see

the sails just turns and licks them and

he's gonna ask blue like you want those

off yes sir

all right how do I get them down I don't

know I thought you had something you

could do like nothing I could do

you're not you I mean I could I mean if

there's water on the ship I can watch it

okay never mind

no I want to be useful we've got astral

water right there's water do come down

right yeah but she doesn't know how to

do it shouts a little short okay okay

I'll shake it chill very slowly and

someone definitely the work to kind of

reel the it's going to take her a little

while to figure out that she's not a

slave anymore because right now she's

kind of waiting for the ominous red and

black mercenaries to treat her probably

the same way that the other guys did but

she'll figure out that that's nothing

guys and she doesn't have useful so

she'll start she'll start reeling in

that the psychics

cool okay well can we go talk to massing

happen absolutely know that we're uh

we're out ring it was first wait

cause it's normal payment who's gonna

talk to her

here's a repaid yeah

you guys already babe when you go she

had you negotiated and it was not as if

not it was money it was not enough to

deck him with the Treasury guy well I

mean we're still gonna need to follow

them to capital yeah well but word you

know so be on our ship so who's gonna go

talk to captain messier than who come in

yep huh she is below decks

she's intercourse and cadastre we'll go

get her and she comes out what happened

to sweet he's gone

yeah I'm telling you hat looks like he

did really had to do I assume this means

nails is gone for gone - yeah should you

see anything happen out here in the last

I guess blood like our energy uh she

yeah the she describes like there were a

lot of lights coming from the top of the

dark dream

she says ice we all assumed but that was

you fighting something or someone it

seems like you won well let's take a

wind shift we command it now you can she

can she probably it's just you're

talking to her if unless you unless the

entire crew there's all you guys all

drop down to reports yeah we're probably

you you you command as a dark dream yeah

how only uh only the mine fires can you

know that ships alive right mm-hmm

congratulations

we still need to follow you to get the

capital well we're gonna take the men

over on the dark cream so always always

is your ship all you want to get away

from the safe Jack's business right I

want to get away from all of it she says

well looking at you looking you up and

down in here uniform let's get out of

the actual sea get us to cap oh and then

you're good to go

you have your she says she says telling

telling Edisto to set a course for

capital and she closes the door alright

she closes the door it's like Kings

still in the room with no so yeah Tiesto

will tell the crew to get underway and

they'll go back to their thinking in

shifts to propel the ship using the

power of thought but you guys don't need

that with a dark dream the song name to

Nevers has a giant brain yeah all it

needs to do is know where to go this was

bad news

while they were doing that slim was

scavenging armor and weapons those

uniform

you get a silver savor my magic you get

a silver get the Sabre whatever though

is it is it a great sword

yeah it's whatever it's whatever you

normally use but it's a wound and silver

yeah competition now bro what does runed

does that mean anything it just means it

looks cool all right as long as

I do extra damage they do if you are not

a good guy gift in other words I don't

get that correct good guys I think their

power of the sword is inversely

proportional to the life expectancy of

the person will do so as long as we're

looking forward to slim being around for

more than three rounds of combat and he

do you want us to please don't our

current track record that's true that's

true

yesterday I think I think I can say with

some certainty that this is yeah this is

the chin this is the chain of a crown

that will arrive in capital it's 8:30

we traditionally take break I don't know

how long if it depends probably about 10

minutes and we're gonna have a slide

show with some of the parts that we have

some of the art we've already featured

some of the are we having been able to

feature and when we come back we might

have some people send us stuff I think

that we may look at and then also we got

a lot of new cool art I don't know what

we did to deserve the colossal amount

and quality are the people creating I'm

starting to cool on the notion we're

calling fan art because I think it's

just art I think it's just great art

people are creating and I feel like

calling a fan art is somehow like

somehow implying that it's less bad than

any other work and it's not because the

stuff people are making is amazing

I wish I'll say quick somebody somebody

jump overboard just keep an eye on see

folks will see you posting about 10

minutes I think I can start break

we're back we were talking about you

care what they say

[Laughter]

so normally at this time in the show as

sort of a thank you for sticking around

and not fleeing the way I imagined most

people probably would after the stream

launches in your life we like to roll

the sounds good so Jerry King looks like

he should be in charge of the world

remember him remember nails his nails

remember nails John is a regular in art

extremes and this is another yeah in

fact there's a stained glass version of

this but this is a second in the tarot

card series nice I love a sweater mm-hmm

remember sweet

I love beautiful I love when people draw

nails with Thompson's yeah yeah the good

news is copper big yeah that's really

yep I remember that character good times

yeah I just saw this today looks awesome

yeah said this is in progress but it

just looks sick right yeah this feels

like yeah yeah standard you want to

taste that this was like a memoriam I

just want to show off some of the stuff

that people sent us first of all some of

it I and I think many of us work here

our huge fan of Devon drew who is an

artist and a bunch of maps and it's just

in general an awesome person sent us a

bunch of these they're basically paper

weights to hold down they're amazing

they like one of them is a like an

astrolabe one of them is a sextant they

have crazy detail and put some of them

on the like where the map is so people

can see them because we can get a good

close-up of that there's a bunch of

these there they're like heavy brass and

she just sent these to us and I love

them I think they're if you are I am a

fan of gaming paper which often I use in

folds of light wrapping paper and that's

one of these one of the things this

stuff is for is to hold down the corners

of your battle map if you were like me

you had those chess X classic vinyl bow

mats that we're going to curl up at the

edges then these would be really cool we

this is not a paid advertisement we just

like Devon and she sent assistant also

someone whose name I don't know

send us a painted version of a 3d

printed course off Master Kadmon

this is a is designed by our friend

Steven Oakley this is one of the

Clemente well it's a member of the Court

of all flesh one of the things you can

summon if you have a temple which is one

of the four types of strongholds if you

have a temple is a chance if you pray to

your God you'll be rewarded with this

guy will come help you out in battle and

in fact corpse al-fasiqun has one of my

favorite and this is Keith's 3d model

that he 3d printed it he painted us and

sent it to us looks awesome course

al-fasiqun has one of my favorite

abilities he gets his multi attack his

four shots per round he has four arrows

per round if he if he hits you with

three of them you have to make a saving

throw right out the gate that's not

likely right right out of the gate you

have to get hit three times and fail

saving throw but if that happens then

you have to roll on the reincarnation

table to see what your new this is from

Luke thank you again thank you Luke

Brubaker this is a super cool loop but

even cooler than this is the one you

sent Oakley which is like this big so

this is actually to scale and is usable

as a mini and so Oakley the artist

actually got one of these too which I

thought was super cool thanks to Ajax

and it's something named Jeff they're

good man she sent us these are made it's

a bunch of condition markers for your

minis I think there may be a little bit

of a utility issue because a lot of our

meetings have square bases and these are

round but here you can say that oh wow

it smells like primer and paint you're

frightened there's a couple of each of

them is grappled there's poison actually

from using this hex this cursed

there's hastin so this is a great way of

keeping track is there room in that

drawer there yeah don't put it behind

you Tom

[Music]

neato torpedo an attempt was made so

anyway

David dandy I don't no idea what

happened when last we left our heroes oh

yeah you guys are you've communicated to

captain asking him that you are going to

tip that you're taking over there

basically disembarking that the chain of

a cron are you gonna issue the order to

your troops to get on the Dark Reign

yeah you see alright okay

people the soldiers start feeding across

many of them don't look super excited

about the prospect of going to Serrano

squishin an alien squid ship but some of

them are like that it's the it's the

time stay crazy should happen sometimes

- mm-hmm we used to fly around they

played in castle when we work with lady

brass so this is wildly different than

that and it takes a while because it's a

very narrow New England so it takes

about an hour to get everybody over and

now your son's gonna stand there in his

new uniform watching them file by

inspecting them as they go yeah like one

of the soldiers is uh is from Vanguard

he's like six foot six and someone he

walks by he's like a head level and you

like he's like well you look at it he

doesn't say that but he kind of gives

you and then he keeps going he's just a

ranking finds stare down a hellhound so

uh we know where the pole is there like

I said there are pools okay

you can throw protein into but like you

can feed it all the dead bodies you're

gone it's not gonna be enough like it

needs to it needs to eat like a whale oh

well thanks yeah but the dead bodies

aren't good start yeah they'll keep it

like happy yeah yeah

have the get them in there all the white

poles work well it depends there are

lots of for my poles that well they all

do they don't all do the same thing Oh

give me the that's not the brain pool no

there's a lot of the feeding pools are

on the metal deck we're just the lowest

to handle it if the big one all right

here so we're really thrown for a loop

now we go after the fissure to the

waiting God by all means we took out one

that's true I would do that you just got

to be more yeah how many how many need

slaying arrows do you need mark more

yeah I mean nobody ages are in the world

more than three yeah we need that many

how many mages are left in the chain not

that many actually there's like butts is

probably of all the retainers I think

butts is the only real spell caster now

and I don't know that they're already

ranked the rank-and-file guys don't have

class they're like basically first level

soldiers new bits yeah absolutely it's

units I mean I still need to figure out

Kings retainer yeah cuz I have well from

this point from this point forward you

don't automatically get retainers just

for your Christmas you have to recruit

them that's what I was talking about

earlier oh is that like a new recruit

past your charisma amount yeah there's

no there's no that that charisma value

was just a aid to memoir for me to tell

you like well certainly you guys are

starting with some junior officers

already how many I could just one random

member I guess roll a random number pick

a number

but I well how about we base it on your

charisma and so those are the junior

officers and from this point forward if

you want more junior officers you got to

recruit like the normal way you recruit

NPCs by meeting people and be nice to

them

ha I just say the normal way other

people recruit NPCs by being nice it

doesn't bring them down all right well

how do we how do we get out of here how

do we how do we actually get the capital

now well there's a couple of issues one

is that you guys are still in the middle

of the Maelstrom like if you guys just

emerged into real space from here you'd

be destroyed you have to basically

follow captain ass again yep

and then she has her own method forget

him but actually I think the the

navigator on the somnium tenebrous it

can use its ability to get both ships

through without her having to use this

year hmm oh because it's design it's

designed to work on like it's got an

area effect and it's designed to work

any fleet of ships but that is probably

no more than three total ships including

the somnium islem um are you able to

communicate with the navigator like the

way that nails was able to wear a

respond anybody with anybody who is

psychic yep okay cool

so are we I don't know that I don't know

that slim ever has that's up to you

whether you because there was obviously

like someone's job right was talking to

the navigator right so are we able to

relay that information to massing him

about the fact that we believe the

navigator can get both ships through

without them talking about sure if we

knew that information are we're over on

the ship he knows if he can I'm sure

that while we were having cheez-its this

one was telling you folks whatever

whatever Phil thinks is reasonable for

him to explain like is there anything

you know about this ship that you

wouldn't don't is right like there may

be things that I haven't told you but in

principle is do you feel like oh I might

might keep something secret from the

chain or no I would just don't I don't

think so yeah I mean we just weren't

then it doesn't help it doesn't help

slim to have a crew that doesn't know

how sure ship works yeah

all right yes so I would think that he

would give as much information do it

okay well captain SEM is

I mean that she doesn't have to call up

on this ear because that trip is

dangerous

mm-hmm and it's not unusual for people

to be like lost or bored and stuff like

that turn into God's so so now we sailed

now we sailed together but apart she

says okay she holds out her hand and she

says yeah don't take this the wrong way

but I hope we never meet again I

understand that you really are

let's now booth what would happen wait

where did that where did this take place

gonna be probably like on the melon no

no problem the quarterdeck oh yeah yeah

so anybody who wants to be there can be

there cuz now she is now that now that

you've kind of woman her up she's taking

charge of ship this creature has a weak

soul oh yeah nice ring Edisto are you

also planning to travel to capital yeah

and we want to uh we want to take that

gear that we took of the orcs I mean

you're wearing well okay I guess that's

the reason you guys are medium infantry

now it's a light infantry you need some

pudding for copper oh yeah that's

important and at least the food that

they have for the works

we need that massing hams like you don't

need any pudding and good éstos like the

important things yeah I think I'll stay

good estou whenever we dock in capital

let's talk with you about what we can do

when we're at the docks in regards I'd

be happy exchange for a tour of the

inside of that beast that is torment at

the sea of stars or as long as I've been

sailing sure it's not that impressive

it seems impressive from the outside

it's disgusting

okay as it is it full of mind flayer

bodies you guys haven't killed that one

so it's gonna be like another two days

before you guys get out of the Maelstrom

it would the space sometime are they

correlate but not one-to-one right so it

would take two weeks to cross but now

it's going and you guys alright it takes

like three days and you guys already

spent one day crossing so you guys are

still gonna spend another couple days on

the astral sea okay but and you guys are

you know cadet so we'll make a schedule

with you judge since you know you see he

sees King as kind of the equivalent to

captain Isaiah

yeah he'll be a schedule with you we're

like a couple of times a day the boats

will dock so if anybody needs to cross

back and forth but there any supply as

you guys need yeah we do we have a

kitchen on this boat I mean there is a

there is a there was a mess there is a

mess halt there's as although it has all

the features that are really well fitted

galley

it's got crew mess it's got a junior

officer mess it's got a there's like a

the equivalent of like a skilled laborer

or like an NCO mess there's an officer's

mess there's quarters for everybody

there it's much much like any other

galleon there's a lot of work just

keeping this thing running a lot of

maintenance

just keeping it going so some members of

some of your soldiers are gonna have to

be pressed into service to become like

sailors basically even though like the

ship has a huge brain it does use these

sails that catch the psychic wind and

that needs rigging and all sorts of

other stuff and the ship had like the

difference is that a lot of what you

need on the raw so Seattle is carpentry

and smithing and there are people that

do nothing all day except so to keep the

sails functioning the kind of the

equivalent on the somnium to neveress is

like being a doctor there's a organs and

stuff like that that have to be

maintained and

it's not like being a carpenter it's

like being a searching awesome huh cuz

you keep them on me when you were you're

walking around inside the somnium to

neighbors it's like being inside

arteries right it's it's it's you're

inside a giant living thing you said you

had identify right can you identify that

gem and the blood red smooth stones I

mean this room will suit my hair do you

interface with the ship yes is it down

on the pilot's seat

so yeah the pilot seat reclines and

because of the because of your specific

physiology the there's little like all

over slims body there were these

discolorations there are these like

patches of very dark colored skin

amongst his ochre skin and these

tendrils okay and they stick to these

little spots on his scalp and you are

that and bad way now you're the pilot

like technically before this moment you

were not the guy who had the bind not

the connection right but now now even

when you view when you disengage from

this thing you're still gonna have that

connection and now if you want you can

talk to the navigator you can set a

course I will do that all right

um how can we put the can we put Devin's

coins out on like somewhere like maybe

on the battlenet so that when Jerry is

that way people watching the tactical

stream can see them because she just

tuned in and she's like they talked

about the coins we love them we think

they're awesome

I think the detail on there was super

cool and I actually love I love the

artistry in them and the way they have

like do a little racer what's the world

looking for I had like an astrolabe at

home and a sextant at home that I

actually just like your fingers wait am

i flipping over what no nevermind

there is a there is a unused one of

those in the kitchen we've been using

this this brokedown eraser now for

months under males to us there's a whole

fresh ones I mean everything I mean it's

typical of us so yeah I actually bought

a prop sextant ones to use in DNA but it

came our deeper so yeah these are super

cool there are legal brass paperweights

so yeah the the Navigator has a lot to

say let's hear it really work yeah you

hear a voice and you know you've never

done this before you've seen other gifts

but you hear a voice say in your head

this is intelligence there are

critical faults in all organ systems

it's a female voice it's very kind of

non inflected estimate complete estimate

complete cellular breakdown in 13 ovas

okay well well feeding the dog our

bodies yeah I mean I'm I'm gonna you

know used to imagine imagine like

remember alien imagine asking questions

to mother it's very the same thing yeah

I mean I'll ask ask it okay what do we

need to do to fix yeah videos the song

m2 neveress is a heavy dread not psionic

propulsion it requires protein to

maintain vital systems yes : approve is

it requires approximately 1000 Leica's

of protein every week okay do I know how

much others you have no idea okay it's

some crazy mind flayer the O'Malley and

it starts reporting the emollient field

is a 15 percent and the popular manifold

is at 8 percent and will fail within the

next 15 movies these a modular

synthesizer they all bear the judges

spells

yeah apparently she spells the

references to okay I know

I want I want it to sort of basically

make a to-do list of maintenance things

okay yeah well you know what that list

is okay so like it does it and transmits

it to your minds so I can just recall

the okay here's a we need all right can

I talk to people while I'm doing this no

okay no you can you can like your base

yeah you're basically like it's a

imagine like you're at the barber and

it's just really loud so you might be

able to talk but you wouldn't know

you're you wouldnt be able to hear

yourself your tone of voice you're not

super aware but people standing around

you or not but then when you come to

right okay what's the rooming situation

on this there's there's actually the the

Navigator will say that the crew

complement of as is for 15 15 Allah

deaths and 80 slaves 20 so there's

there's quarters for all you there's

like nice places for you folks and

there's somewhat Spartan facilities

because they're slight borders or all

your soldiers is the battery on for that

yep how was the battery pack because we

need to remember to turn it on when we

unplug the thing okay

yeah so we're bad about them but I think

we just need a battery pack solution

that doesn't require store every stuff

are these labels accurate met probably

mostly I reserve the right to overrule

it and as it turns out to be like okay

here's where the +5 Holy Avenger is

stored wait what but otherwise yeah I

used I used that when I was designing

the adventure okay um Jenna's gonna come

in near one of these rooms and set it up

this like his own goes like right now

he's completely spent like my energy box

is completely dead yeah yeah

the they're really nice quarters for I

might like like there's all sorts of

expensive like it's 1917 Spencer gift

stuff in here like crazy crazy like RGB

all the things

can I tell if there's a bed or is it

like it's like a it's like a Waterman

it's not actually literally it's not

it's not actually literally a water but

it's a big squishy gelatinous probably

living mattress it's okay you don't have

to feed it it naturally will eat all of

your dead skin cells yeah you know you

have you have normal adventuring here so

you can put it but it's it yeah yeah

yeah

it's a boy so where do you want to be on

the captain's dick there are there rooms

on the campus deck there are actually

rooms enough rooms on the captain's neck

for everyone and sure well you guys are

but but but that's Slim's room right

there yeah I love this yeah what I'll

try to do between now and the next time

we play is get a version of that map it

has the rooms but not the grid because

the grid the way that grid is printed on

there just makes it hard to beat

yeah yeah yeah there's two fives yeah

you guys but you should get your own you

guys don't have to you guys there's

plenty of rooms no arms the command deck

which is right below it has a tongue a

lot of tongue a lot of those rooms

aren't quarters there are helmsman

quarters British Helms bridge officers

huge yeah it's I mean lutely

the Rosso Cielo is as detail cool

Turnage bombards yeah it's got its got

but don't forget it's if you if you can

find the brains

it's a tempurpedic gelatinous cube so be

in chat battle me avenge just said it's

a tempurpedic gelatinous cube actually

it is very like a gelatinous cube that

you would sleep on yeah the mattress I'm

sure you'd wake up not not covering you

but refreshed yeah this is just a bit

like the Ross Osceola was just as a

bigger ship they're both fake galleons

the battle deck looks like it's if you

guys define brains if you guys can find

brains to plug into them you also have

psionic cannons

there's a lot of crew quarters in the

battle deck well we got that one my

player that we chopped the floppy arm

from so yeah I want to wait you chop the

floppy arm from it guys did we just

celebrate oh yeah it's like an half oh

yeah what that guy how can I make it so

that like these guys can access the

rooms without having to use them you

just tell the navigator you just help a

navigator to like who the officers are

and then their hand principal okay it's

up to basically you're gonna set

security permissions yeah

and it's up to you in the Navigator all

you have to do is imagine the person and

imagine what you want them to do in the

Navigator we'll say we'll say you know

cool pattern recognized right now yeah

cool file can then now have it giving

them all the proper permissions

except for my room okay well you don't

have to worry about that there they

don't have like they don't natively have

the capacity to interface the way you do

so they couldn't they could talk the

navigator the only reason nails could do

it was because he was in god mode and

had infinite power gotcha its memory

eating foam my memory foam its memory

eating sorry chat chat likes chat likes

the feel of events sure they're very

comfortable is anyone is anyone gonna

sleep in the illicit bits okay copper I

probably should I'm not very healthy and

they don't kill you they just love I

mean it's just they kind of well when

you wake up you don't feel like as grody

yeah it's almost like oh I took a shower

yeah smile disability exactly this thing

was during the night yeah that's how my

flavor stays so silky smooth as ice it's

like they look at it they moisturize no

they did sleep on these beds

sounds quite refreshing okay cool uh I

can I figure out what the medium size

crystal this how would you go about

figuring out pokken product

another season before anything in the

chronicle make a history

well and it probably is you know that

it's it seems like it's a maybe like a

[Music]

you know it's got something to do a

gemstone dragons but more than that you

don't know you don't you the King sir

that doesn't know what Lars notes yeah

all right maybe it's an egg maybe it's a

gem star dragon egg maybe identify well

we'd uh all right we should we have

arrested yeah well yeah we got at least

three things when you guys I'm fine okay

you guys drank those potions right yeah

oh sorry are there other things in

the astral see that this your penny uh

yeah but not without a fight that you

might lose hmm Mike if you guys if you

guys end up on the mundane world then

there's a lot you can just put it on on

control mode and it'll go and it'll eat

krill if it has to like yeah and it

might it might find and hunt and fight

whale and probably not have to unless it

was like a sperm whale probably wouldn't

have to worry about like oh look a bunch

of dolphins the rum but the stuff on the

astral see fights back and it's as tough

it would be like fighting another ship

right okay no the question is if we can

make it back to back to orden on however

many fluke DS of oh we only have three

days would be kind of ridiculous

nonsense so you're inventing that we got

to imagine that 14 flute DS is more than

two days so

oh that's right yeah we move the bodies

that we just fed it at least we'll tide

it over for a bit yeah I mean there was

a lot of like what like how many company

was that do our guards know the Giants

right we're about a huge no damn right

like Power Bars I mean it will it will

it makes a difference yeah but it's like

something that's starving and you gave

it a power bar right like it's like okay

it's the promise of more food economy at

least something that was thinking about

my welfare as well as ship is thinking

back now this ship by the way the ship

doesn't actually have like a brain the

brain is the navigator so it's like an

amoeba yeah it's it's a collection of

organs that's got nervous system but it

doesn't the ship doesn't think the

Navigator things okay and you think you

and the navigator the two of you ship

plan and ship intelligence are in fact

that's one of the things that happens

when you interface with the ship

I'll be like the part of the ritual is

you're the whoever the pilot is says

this is shift command and this shift

command their ship intelligence and

that's like pilot and that's the

navigator cool right on I think any

other information we should try to get

off of the again side yeah what are you

gonna do with her she just would like to

have her own quarters and relax and not

be a prisoner just she's hungry did you

clean the sails I mean it's gonna take

one person doing it it's gonna take a

long time but she's working can we move

if the sails are no yeah you just don't

move as fast it's just a question of

like the Navigator the ship and the

navigator combined book I was the kind

of a brain power to propel themselves

things are more like more like a turbo

boost right like when the ship is boom

the ship needs this needs speed to catch

up to somebody use mrs. OH

anyway yeah but like it caught up to the

moving faster than the Ross Osceola

right now anyway so we could get them

cleaned we could have some of the guys

take care of it then put our symbol on

it yeah yeah and like help out what's

her name cos then that's kind of a show

of faith that we're not just

yeah jerks right what is it jerk join me

we're not dried meat we are not trying

precisely little drops of conversation

yeah so it doesn't know we're not jerks

what does it trick that's like dried

meat yeah okay what else you guys gonna

do over the course of the rest of the

day you know what I mean it's it's safe

you guys have cleared the ship it's

yours I know the judge is gonna rest

take a long rest which meant those

fourth judges clock it was s - yeah so

we'll advance with the likud we can

advance that I stay what do you do with

as loud the Ganassi you just leave her

kind of toiling over the sails we should

have like you know so I'm assuming she

started on them but yeah you know we can

assign a handful of people did ya given

how many soldiers you have there were

quite a few who have similar backgrounds

and we're sailors before there were

soldiers and then and then there are a

bunch more with being on ships a lot

just as soldiers in the chain and kind

of know what to do so they're able to

act as a crew and they're perfectly able

to clean and repair because the sails

are there's a bunch of bail there's a

bunch of hit lifted ale there's like 48

casks of it there's a bunch of food what

that tastes like

we should play some we should play some

red dragon it don't played red dragon in

a long time anyway I have that other

expansion and there's a bunch of purple

what appears to be spiral that is used

to fix repair examples of it take a

liking to her really mm-hmm

code is very like what's that brother

describe cooked me cook is a half lean

woman she's a bit older like in human

terms she's probably in her mid for you

sir maybe early 50s

she's very like stout and matronly and

things like that she's a she's I think

her class is cutpurse god yeah but

she has like crazy frizzy red hair

that's really really coiled and like you

know just not just like a little bit of

freckles it's almost like her skin is

almost all freckles kind of thing but

she just you know putters around she's

she's like the cook company obviously so

do you do you kind of tell her this

judge tell her like look take care of

this person or you think it would happen

like automatically well I think could

happen automatically yes because I think

judges like cook will take as log kind

of under her wing and make sure cuz for

one thing cook recognizes immediately

this person's just deeply undernourished

even though you're not familiar with

water can I see physiology she can just

tell so the one of the first things she

does she makes a cook I mean she makes a

pass log of me

and so uh later that day she'll report

to you cook will come and talk to you

and say yeah I think she's fine I think

she has like she's got I don't know what

the term cook amuses but she is in shock

just from being just from being a slave

on this ship for was how much she

doesn't remember how long she's been on

the ship well that's to be expected just

you do best okay she'll be fine

I'll figure what else can the staff do

the command staff it fit can open doors

and stuff like that it can take off it

can it can there's dozens of those slave

collars it can open and close the slave

collars and it's a route of absorption

what does the navigator know about the

mine fire emblem just find out I mean

the navigator knows what was written in

the log which was that his name's

sueleen I think let's say you got rid of

that selearis the my employer's name is

sue Lera and he was telling you the

truth he was arrested because he was

basically sentenced to some grisly fate

after they their their livings dude they

live in to down there on purpose just to

kind of get his mind spinning as to what

what horrible things are gonna happen to

him but they were gonna kill him because

mine flavors have a very kind of cruel

Society and exactly what he said we're

gonna they were a murder the they didn't

think the air the water gonna say had

any value and so they were just gonna

kill her he's like no I want torture

they're gonna fight about it those that

collar on him do we know anything about

that is that basically like make him

harmless well he would still have any

physical abilities he had before like

his his brain eating thing would still

work because that's purely physical

biological but it's a dampener for all

of his psychic power so isn't like

because my blast wouldn't work his

spells would work all right

it spells wouldn't work his mind last

wouldn't work but he can still be

dangerous captain the sooner we get rid

of that creature the better

commander sorry it's IPA the Ale is IPA

lifted pituitary ale drank any of it no

it's it's the stuff you had was

basically like rum grog watered-down rum

no this is the nice stuff is it true is

it potable is it drinkable is it like

kick away I mean yeah kill any of ya

like when they would have drow guests

and stuff on the ship and other people

that they treated like equals they would

serve this a also creatures from across

the time scape have had good like anyone

who tried like I'm wondering if like it

is it just like sit right yeah that's

tasty yeah it's thick and viscous like

it you can do this weird thing with

women we if you start pouring it out of

the bottle it'll start pouring out and

then you can literally tip the bottle in

the ocean and it'll suck it back in

because it's like it's like jello yeah

it's it's like a superfluid it's like a

non-newtonian fluid but yeah it's it's

really sweet it's really long almost

like cloyingly sweet like like unless

you really like sugared stuff it's juice

hmm

hmm sweet nails doesn't have a mouth

anymore so I can't talk to us sweet

sweet n you it's true the corpse has to

have a mouth yeah so says it's true

that's that's why I made sure he didn't

have one thank you

yeah you also don't have it memorized I

know because I look huh you also didn't

have speak with Davis it's a new day

it's not yet a new day it will be new to

any mark you can actually change your

spells as a cleric you just got to spend

I believe it's my field get back up but

it's like a couple minutes bird well the

spell or something like that

 take my word for it so yeah unless

there's anything else you folks wanna do

it'll be the next day and you guys will

get I'm just one more question yeah

does the slim have to be hooked up in

the pilot's chair to keep the ship

moving canny like basically tell the

navigator we can just talk to the

navigator no ok yeah you can tell the

navigator what to do alright so is there

any the Navigator can't do stuff on its

own right right you have to tell it what

to do it can it plots the corn you you

picture where you want to go right and

if you know what plants on the Navigator

will figure out how to get there and

then the Navigator can act like an

autopilot but once it completes that

construction it just sits there right

like unless unless the pilot tells it

what to do right gotcha

and and the pilot needs to be connected

through the hoses to tell it what to do

no no no no no not now that you've ever

faced with okay so is there any reason

why slim will ever need to sit in that

chair again it's not the slim nose but

it may be that the connection to the

navigator used to be refreshed or maybe

that there are some like like it there

may be a difference between sending you

images and actually talking to it

directly right but you've never done

this before right the fairness

hurry fully healed after a long rest you

regain all your head points you restore

all of your class abilities I believe

and you get half of any adverse Bennett

dice so I don't know if you guys spent

any of those I was just down there

fighting the whole time yeah

is there anything interesting in the

history of the her garden Noble it's an

obscure book it's like kind of a it's a

book your garden version of the story of

one of the minor houses in the War of

the Roses it's accurate and you've heard

of that family but you've never heard of

this book before it does apart from the

fact that it's really well made really

well made and old

like I say well made I mean like it's

got gold inlay and stuff like that it

doesn't have any kind of historical

value

okay can you identify the this is the

next day this stuff is all elephant

elephant treasure yes okay well it's the

stuff they couldn't use it's like it

belonged to them but it was stuff that

they harvested and then I was like well

I know he's for this they toss didn't

know I'd like her to a bin you know so a

judge is gonna do his prayers the next

day to be able to get his spells and

stuff back to you

Oh esmad yes hear me

it's long if I just call you know Dias

nice I have my chamber - did that him

know so yeah whenever he comes out he's

gonna meet up with King and start

identifying some of this stuff it's

gonna take ten minutes per item could it

cast it as a ritual that's fine I'll do

the small job first that's some kind of

buoyancy vision pump stone I guarantee

you people in chat figured it out

there's no I don't we'll see I'm curious

to watch enough chat back perception or

some it is an iron stone of awareness I

don't take

if you take it you toss it up in the air

and it starts to around your head and in

fact something new and if they're very

dexterous they didn't grab it and there

are different colors and different

shapes and the one little goofy so if

you have this and you toss it up in the

air and starts spinning around your head

you cannot be surprised I'm sorry good

doesn't do anything from check sir if

you take it throw it up in the air it

spins right ahead you can't be surprised

what about the the bag of pebbles yeah

is the taxman I assume you guys kick ass

detect magic on the typical those

of you who have not played D&D lately

for throgs

the typical process is use a minor spell

like detect magic to be or what's magic

and then you actually identify humans

can just tell us those matter I forget

who's zooming yeah you're doing

Slim's making friends would a cat make

animal handling check oh he's not trying

to handle them he's just trying to make

friends with them yeah okay

well I was in charge of fifth edition so

there isn't to make friends with a big

cat skill okay this is the best we can

do

obviously yeah where there would have

been if I'd been a 20/20

oh yeah yeah yeah big big cat battefield

when big cat sits down on Silas his head

is about the same height as yours nice

he is she is a half feet tall sitting

well yeah cuz she's got six legs so when

she's when she sits it's almost like a

centaur right because she's got four

legs sitting and then two legs still up

and yeah she'll chill if you try to make

nice to her mmm she'll just wrinkles I

just don't take a barbed

tongue and scrape it across your face

and now you've got now you've got think

that's yeah absolutely

I think it's really loud so reason but

they also they purr when they're angry

so it's are they for where they're angry

they probe when they're hungry and

they're per work when they're happy and

so a jury interests me are you writing

big cat at this point yeah after I slept

yeah what is this creature can twist

yeah you've seen displace obvious Muir

but they're usually wild yeah often what

usually they've always only ever been

wild before in fact you probably know

more about this place a basis on

oh really mobile oh yeah

I don't even I don't think I think this

might be the only living this place are

based apart wonderific apart from one or

two you may have encountered been the

way to getting this yet and I think

you've ever seen it this place weeks

before there that's why as I common in

the in the plains the blood red stones

the blood red stones are blood they're

called blood pebble Armour and if you

take the stones and you if you were

tuned to them basically if you put them

against your skin

they will into your skin and they act

like they act like on would you have to

put them all over your body and they

don't stack with regular armor you wear

them instead of armor all right they

give you a c-13 plus your decks mod so

they are plus three decks mater whatever

it is that chain man no no no no hey

chain ones like AC 15 and powers I think

so this is actually way better than like

it's like better than the leather buy

one mmm yeah that's like it's definitely

not a number but if you do this if you

if you put these blood blood pebbles all

over your skin it drains one hit guy

while you're wearing them so you just

have one few red dye however at every

short rest

you get a one D a temporary advice mmm

whatever a boys doing stack yeah so now

when people if you wear if you are

wearing this symbiotic armor and

something attacks you there's a the way

it works as armor is there's a good

chance that this does kind of the sores

or the weapons are gonna just chip off

of this these blood pebbles what's your

uh what are you wearing just leather

love it yeah so what's your AC sixteen

sixteen and your decks is plus five yeah

does it give you the full five decks uh

yeah yeah well it's basically one better

than the best light you get eight like

the best light armor it is 12 plus decks

ba this is thirteen that'd be good

sure yeah alright that is are you gonna

wear the blood pebble armor yes huh

interesting looking goblin man blood-red

stones you can see if you can't wear

armor with the blood Pablo it is your

armor but you can wear your normal

clothes you can wear your normal uniform

okay that's doesn't say I don't to be

like naked except for these stones I

know is this your naked go yeah don't

put them on your it's just like imagine

like a really strong adhesive like if

you go to take one of them off it won't

come off until you just like it's um

remember that do we that when Jerry got

that mug well if you just if you just

leave it off the right way though and

they'll stop off right but otherwise

than what they really want to stick you

probably don't want to cover up any

holes medium size crystal is it's a

medium silent crystal yeah it's got 12

charges it recharges 26 Wow what does

crystal do it gives you psionic

abilities yeah it gives you a body gives

your pencils and followers it gives you

access it gives you access it gives you

a certain number charges that you can

use on psionic manifestations and it and

it grants you knowledge of a handful of

psionic manifestations how many charges

you said 1212 charges and recharges one

to six everything if you ever use the

last charge there's a chance that it

just won't recharge anywhere what's the

name of the what you're not gonna find

it in Dungeons & Dragons got it I

thought doesn't do anything okay there's

not a DVD thing sorry I mean it's

somebody I stole it from Earth Don

old Passover BJ okay so - okay yeah

and so what does that mean with blood

panel armor can he just use it - were

tres gives him temp HP of a1 d8 does

that just mean after he puts it on in

the morning he can just be like huh

here for an hour and then get that temp

HP at the start if you just where he can

sleep okay there's no centromere

adoption hmm so one day eat every day

yeah just tell me what you just have one

for your hip die and +2 AC which might

not never be a problem because it's like

you guys actually made it for 36

encounters okay tell me if there are the

things you spend yeah yeah oh I thought

it was - one HP no it's my hit time

which actually won't do anything unless

you guys need to heal a lot which so far

you haven't needed to do like you guys

got through six encounters yesterday I

believe and you didn't need to know if

he's been a it does uh no we did we

didn't want to arrest and uh I used at

least one but I used uh her healing

during the rest so don't remember

resting whatsoever you guys took a short

rest it was one week it was after we

took the hand we did it cuz I bought all

this bad I know because people on

YouTube complain about

they were like what there's a boarding

action and they're just gonna sit here

for an hour

that's stupid well maybe we didn't take

this rest of them they just took about

ten minutes for me to cast I think it

took us ten cigarette in the hand don't

need it anymore

hey no that's a Guapo it's traffic with

one purple glove is death go talk to my

player guy again me I'm into us mmm why

we shouldn't go down there alone

we gotta feed them to the Beast at some

point thirty minutes ago okay

so yeah it's now there's uh this is the

second day and there's gonna be one

after this before according to the

Navigator you guys will be back in the

mundane world and then presumably with

inside of capital and so net today is

just normal boat beginning to know the

somnium to neveress slim knows a lot

about it because he was a slave he

doesn't know everything because he was

not one of the one of the masters until

the very end and even then he did not

join in the revolt did you ask the

navigator to convert who was two days

and hours I could do that it doesn't

really know how it doesn't have a basis

for it uses celestial mechanics it's

like oh yeah wet one once every once

every rotation of the immanent uses

other fruit did does not understand this

comes fourteen attack from Omicron say

okay well every Islamic Revolution is a

movement you know what what the is

an it's just constantly referring to

yeah it just constantly refers to things

circularly like if you're from whatever

the wherever the mind flayers homeworld

is the stuff would make sense to you but

otherwise it's garbled untranslatable

nonsense okay so how did the rebellion

happen or why didn't you join the

rebellion I

you mean against the elephant's yeah

like how did they how did the people who

rebelled come under Ajax's thumb I did

join in the rebellion against the

elephants

I just wouldn't serve Ajax that's why

they threw me and then oh but what

happened with Ajax he came the order

well what happened was like mortem

appeared before the gift and said I I

can give you the power to free

yourselves but then you have to join up

you have to work for Ajax and the other

gift were like five percent and you're

like wait we're just trading one slave

we're straining one master for another

right so the the that was one event or

was actually the most recent events I

see what mortem also sounds like a

winner just like blindly follows this

guy so who blindly follows him

more to blindly follows Ajax now that

you're all resting up against Weiner you

should know that we interception Ajax

has a an agent I mean it is either on

the other ship or in the chain I'm not

sure who it is that's probably followed

us but I heard I heard mortem to talk

about it we've got a we've got a we've

this personality how how crazy whoever

he or just way to be like hey way to

kill your character no problem

and then your next characters gonna be a

spy my nails did say don't trust the the

booty one did they indicate if there's

some way that this person was he

wouldn't send no trust me if he was

somebody he knew in the chain do it said

their name you wouldn't say don't trust

be boots oh man how would we even go

about figuring out who we could just

kill it well it could be that they're on

the other ship and if we destroy that

ship and the problem resolved mm-hmm you

hear on the voice of the my employer

from the prison jerkily good idea down

there talking about this wrong no I

can't do that didn't ya what let's go

ahead and kill us my employer I mean

it's not gonna hurt I'll kind of misses

stories but there have me a lot of

interesting people on Capitol this is

true all right do you wanna go with us

might give us a mine fire but I mean I

think as many the mini is really cool

but like my part is not as cool as the

mini yeah my players at least two

schools know is there some sort of place

that we can attach to the ring is like I

was like like how they did with Hannibal

man catch

where they had yeah no that's not the

mind flayers ruled mostly through fear

and they just have weapons so they just

told people where to go when they went

there like they didn't know people

didn't when the ship is run by mind

flayers and their slaves people didn't

disobey so they had no they they they

had no need for like physically

manipulating the slaves around touching

is touching this creature would be

unwise just shooting arrows at it

through the cage until it's dead

and then will feed it to the ship I

don't think it's the mind flayer well I

mean I don't think it's a mind flayer

either but I think we need to have angel

start looking out for dents and earth I

guess yeah judges get started to talk

about it but how he communicates back to

more there may be a certain way right

it's like Jayde's I was thinking if

there's a way that he's able to that

whoever this Spy is is able to

communicate back to more room like they

probably are using some kind of magical

item and as I asked is it common for

members of the chaîne to have just magic

items or is that kind of a senior

officer privilege no I mean it's

actually pretty common for them to have

magic because as you guys but it's

usually really minor stuff because this

you guys are like well we're a fifth

level now we have no real use for this

minor thing you'll pass it down to the

lower officers and that's a tradition

going back to when my friends and I

played in the eighties we're like well

we're 15th level now I don't need this

plus one sword and there was there were

rules probably convert a plus one sword

into my soldiers having more power I

don't have rules platon strongholds and

followers but probably kingdoms more

farewell

maybe we'll see but yeah but it's all

Myer stuff and a lot of it's like

expendable it's a lot of assumptions and

what I mean to be honest whether it be

more tuned who is the connector like

where do you probably have sending so

just who's sending even across Plains or

message or whatever one does that to

talk with them and get like a short

report back that's brought you I mean

he's did it that was unless something

has occurred to me mmm-hmm this this

mind flare wouldn't be working for the

mind player is not the not the plan mind

flares definitely a spy but if Morton K

- this ship helped the gift overthrow

the mine flares and then put them in

charge I'm accepting the coordinates to

find us maybe he left the mark with like

some other innocuous being on the ship

never trust him mermaid let's see what

that doesn't explain how is it the dark

dream found our ship mortem told them

how to find us

what the navigator haven't orderly told

them to find you yeah I know I think uh

I guess we the necessary has a log of

like where the where the Ross Osceola

was and they just told a navigator go

that's what that's what that's more to

provide it

how do you know there's a traitor we

didn't ask because I heard I heard that

wizard say it right now yep oh so says

that's what like I'm with you the the

night the gift night that I have been in

charge it was like oh why do we need you

we can just he's like because I know I

can track it I can track that ship

anywhere in the Timescape there's

nowhere they can go with again I have

agents on the ship

agent and put that and agent I have an

agent on the show that sounds like it's

Oh before not that's what I said I can

track so anywhere they go so nobody else

other than the officers knew about the

job other than King so what something

highly likely that they're a member of

the crew on the process yellow better

not be Podesta I like the Dustin there's

one way to there's one way to make sure

but uh give the command

that's way too brutal and we don't have

uh but I

I did see I did see commander suite

maybe most of the rest in power at

typical pieces rest in a misty smear he

dressed as wallpaper on the captain's

room

I did see commander suite fraternizing

with a one of the rank-and-file that

seemed to recognize him I'm a previous

life oh that guy can we talk about this

angel angel knows what's up

angels supposed to watch that guy so

angel shows up and this is during up

this is during a period where the two

ships are docked and people can go back

and forth an angel kind of pads up and

reports to folks and turns to judge and

says boss can I talk to you yeah

probably

chairs would you excuse us while Anna I

have a conversation fine there's

pretzels and cheese at sea is bylaws he

didn't say can I have a conversation

with you well guess what I need to talk

to him you know tender I said I won't

talking into him no I'm talking to right

now yeah okay well then kill he'll wait

for you till wait to talk to you

yes okay what can you sir

apparently I was fine potentials ready a

spy which was somebody reporting to

Morton we're told that the gift I

recruited you trust him yes all right

you want me to find the spot yeah then

bring him to us okay

such Dungeon Master Dungeon

Master is French for five face

you can't people can see a giant middle

finger no I'm putting my hand pointing

people could say it's too gay

all right probably now that we're alone

boss we need to see something what do

you got come with me he pads away and

and you go and you cross to the other

ship Osceola yep and he takes you down

below decks to the crew deck and there's

a bunch of hammocks and butts no one's

on everyone's on duty right now so this

is where the crew of the Ross Osceola

sleep mm-hmm actually no he takes you

down one more floor after the hold or

there's a bunch of cargo and as you're

walking through you know there's a bunch

of stuff stored down here it's stuff

that they were planning on selling when

I got to Kamara but now they're gonna

have to sell in capital there's a tarp

over a crate and it almost looks like

somebody's piled like like potatoes or

something on top of this crate link

covered in the tarp and he takes the

tarp and he pulls it back and there's a

dead body

don't recognize it yep it's zaraki's

what dwarf who serves the chain you

drink too much weight do did he do too

much ass angel like what happened like

how did you find this you know yeah it

was I was down here helping out the crew

mm-hmm like everybody everybody like

before you guys took the ship everybody

here was basically all the soldiers were

acting like kind of makeshift sailors

yeah and he was just down here looking

for places to stow things mm-hmm like he

has a much more plausible explanation

for why you stir yeah he says I was just

down here doing this thing I saw this

and I was like what the hell is that it

looks like something just like loves you

crap here okay so I'm gonna I want to

investigate the body and see if I can

figure out what may be the cause of

death like if it's all immediately

apparent

boss this guy's been dead for like three

days I've seen Ciroc I saw him about two

hours ago what was he doing two hours

ago he was doing normal soldier stuff do

you know where he's at right now now I

couldn't put my finger on him right the

second pad too but I'm sure he's around

okay

do you think he's over here on the

Rosses yellow right now I do you think

probably not I miss omnium yeah I think

almost everybody now there's still some

because we can go back and forth there

are still some soldiers helping out with

the raw sociale just to keep up goodwill

but putting that since and this guy's

body has been like he's a dwarf and

someone's taken him and hang on to stick

up in here so he's not just lying there

in repose he's been he's been like

crushed okay so remember quick up the

time frame that were on three days ago

was that before we entered the Maelstrom

so it's a round when it's a round wind

three three days ago was the day of the

battle at the church in black bottom

right but he would have made it onto the

ship and then somebody do you know um

sorry was the dwarfs name again dwarfs

name is Eric okay do you know what did

Sarah get into something black bottom

he might have I mean I doubt it Xerox

he's a pretty typical dwarf hmm what is

Sarah been doing the past few days have

you noticed I mean I only found this

body like ten minutes ago

yeah that you see have you seen Sarah

that's I mean yes yeah my buddy didn't

make him I didn't notice anything okay

when he was I'm acting unusual or asking

questions or nope was just keeping us

head down and act like a dwarf

have you told anybody else about this I

was gonna tell sweet yeah nice

okay alright thank you

show me this uh let's keep this kind of

quiet right now

um as King said we think that there's a

rat on the ship not another urban kind

that is feeding information to more toom

about our whereabouts so yeah yeah we're

gonna need to take care of this um so I

think at this point judge is definitely

gonna want to work with angel to try and

figure out where Zarek is done and see

if we can figure out what's going on

okay and then judges going to listen

boss if whatever was going on I mean

somebody killed Sarah Rock and stuffed

him in here and now that thing or person

looks like Zarek yeah what happens if I

go to look for this thing and it knows

I'm working that's a good point like if

we're talking about just some sailors or

even like a regular spy no problem yeah

there's something else I mean you'd give

me the order I'll do it but I don't know

what this thing is right we don't know

what we're up against

so should I come back that's a little

bit more tactfully so we can ask you a

question

so this new whatever the hell it is

bigot Yankee yeah I mean that thing's

some kind of alien thing from the astral

see I don't kind of a problem of it

mm-hmm how much do you trust boots

I mean boots has been with us a while he

was boots has been yeah yeah he was you

know he followed nails pretty closely

yeah all right sorry she felt her nails

pretty closely well we aren't sure I

mean that seems strange to you that all

the sudden boots as a senior officer

well we had have somebody pick up Niels

a spot whose idea was it was your idea

of course the princess well I don't

haven't you saying that kind of thing

oh he means your is in the senior

officers oh that's a good question all

right well

I'll keep an eye on z rock but I won't

make a move because I don't know what it

is yeah plus we don't we don't want a

shower again too early if we're gonna

swing you got a hit obviously there's

something going on here I want to ask

them though before we depart is there a

reason you're suspicious of boots just

seems a coincidence so we just found a

dead soldier from a chain and suddenly

boots a senior officer I mean I like

boots is that boots what happens if I go

look for Zurich and I can't find him

mm-hmm what do you suggest I'm waiting

over my head here yeah this trip hasn't

been so hot for anybody I'm just talking

we get the capital alive yeah that'd be

great

all right yeah see if you can find Zarek

if you can put a pin on him you come and

find me I'm gonna be on the somnium to

talk with the other officers I'll talk

with King about this and only King um

should have a code word just in case

something happens I'm terrible at code

words terrible on code words that she

doesn't like your thing no no no my my

creativity lies down a different path

all right what about like oh oh

there's a lot of reason to say that

these days um I'll ask you when's the

last time big cat was fed yeah remember

that yeah what do I say if something if

they if I if there's something going on

something like big cats hungry yeah big

cats hungry but if everything looks good

nothing's weird safe account just got

then got it all right that's good good

all right I'll do the same thing with

King okay cuz he's green but I think I

trust him use Marxist right now you know

he's a chronic work he's practicing

goody-two-shoes as well um got it but

I'm all you're not talking about this

right now okay boss hey do me a favor

get Lars in sent me here

no no just Lauren just Lauren away 100

where we fail we monkey from the camera

so rude it's yeah I can play in limbo

behind that thing listen we all have to

make sacrifices

yeah all right so after talking to Angel

at some point shortly thereafter came

through the normal process of living

life on the somnom two numbers goes back

to his quarters

and and when you walk into your horse do

you see the body of sweets retainer

angel and his throats been slit he's got

a dagger in his hand covered in blood

there was blood all over him it looks

like he's been dead for more than a

minute no no seconds Oh everybody you

listen there's some squirrely son of a

 walking around in this boat

disguised as me what happened you I came

in here to talk to you and and I saw

somebody it looked like me I went for my

dagger we got in a fight I think I lost
