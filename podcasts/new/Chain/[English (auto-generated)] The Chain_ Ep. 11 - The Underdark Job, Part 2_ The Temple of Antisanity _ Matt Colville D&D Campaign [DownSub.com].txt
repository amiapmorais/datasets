the old ones delivered us from freedom

and sanity and blessed us with slavery

and madness

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

just blew everybody's ears out hello

everybody welcome to the chain we may

experience some slight technical

problems because whenever we restart the

audio computer things have to boot in a

certain order or they don't work

correctly so Jerry will let us know if

things drop out those you who are

patrons on our patreon site which

they're probably linked to can read

tonight's notes but I do not advise you

to do so because there are super

spoilers in them unless you don't care

in which case go to it and then once

this adventure is wrapped up we will

post the I'll post the notes for the

whole thing for everybody anyway Phil's

back oh hi and you got your mail Eve oh

is that is that have we not seen your

mini before and as that is a that is a

hero forge printed but custom made mini

coz the actual mini didn't I have Duncan

didn't have gettin Yankee hair right and

didn't have the little braids yeah

where's my mini I don't know oh I put up

with you it's fine it's only the second

time you've been here what can't expect

too much your mini off no good when last

we left our heroes who wants to remind

everybody of what the hell happened last

week who all have to tell Phil what

happened last week I tell me what

happened last week well we took the

Underdark job we went down the other

dark

we got a chart to take us to near abouts

the vicinity of the Isle of madness and

leech sent his familiar OD OD out to

scout Mel Faro and so we all believed to

be the Isle of madness but as we

approached I think it was you two who

realized that it was actually all in

illusion and then the island the the

Mirage of an island that we saw

dissolved away and we were staring at

this kind of giant rocky skull stuck

into a tiny plot of land with seaweed

hair

and snared the ship dragged us towards

it in a small Italian of drow undead

drow sword wraiths came for us and got

smoked by the blades of boots and then

basically we're just trying to go inside

the skull now to try and defeat what we

is then what's called a memory yeah yes

so but which leech leech knows but madam

Driscoll is afraid to pronounce right

but right I'll come [ __ ] it has a proper

name which leech guns but matt is not is

not organized enough to have at hand I

think you're fine says it's rather more

commonly known as the Bell handoff yeah

that's what role karo well they're not

native to either hell or alloy so unless

you're from the Underdark I go ahead and

go ahead and make a history check no no

if they referenced in The Chronicle its

way in the back when they used languages

that King does not speak and it has to

be I heard that judge had some sort of

epiphany and got a point of inspiration

for it was like something was going on

with like the enemies that were coming

out and then I think I was like oh it's

like on those gurus you know where you

have like the shrimp is that are

protecting the fish and the fish are

looking now and they're trying to take a

hold together and stuff and that's the

reason he's not relevant to anything

I'll know well it's just backstory oaths

to what's going on in this island right

because leach who is a native to the

Underdark and nosal he's never been to

this place but he's heard of the of them

he knows he's heard of this island and

he knows about memory eaters but they

don't have anything to do with on debt

so it took the chain dirt it's over the

course of the battle as the players were

trying to figure out if it's a memory

dur what's going on here

dad that's when after a couple rounds

and I was like oh I know what it is

they're like they're like a parasitic

light there's got the symbiotic

relationship and I was like that is

completely correct and so I go get some

advantage did you use it I did right

because we actually I ruled because

Hannah was like it would be cool if and

I was like okay yeah

if event you could use advantage if you

could use inspiration which is what it

is to not just give yourself advantage

but if you want to instead give an enemy

disadvantage unlike saving doors

cuz I actually think of it because it's

a bit super easy to get advantage it's

not it's very difficult to impose

disadvantage on somebody else all right

cool so yeah and you guys fought the how

far did you get in the story well we

defeated the group of drow we cut the

bosses head off in his sole scream

silently and drifted we're on and in

Detective a wind I think he called me a

traitor right as he reached out towards

yeah yeah he called me his name so yeah

there's cool silver scorpions yep

so did you write that stuff now just

remember so what I pay my someone up

here

he's leech right why are you huh why are

you trade live turn my life my back on

drow life okay

drow life sounds like an MTV show yeah

so once we beat that guy his buddies all

disappeared we we picked ourselves up

and briefly dusted our filters off and

he'll there's also a army of skeletons

oh yeah we judge ordered toad to kind of

man the troops and defend the ship as we

investigate inside this total island

toad is a junior officer he's an old

gnarled tattooed ex Ian exeunt look like

Aztec dudes or actually they look like

old neck we're going to be super

technical and they don't speak he appear

to be mute but it doesn't know the chain

sign and he does seem to be able to

communicate with judge mm-hmm like

telepathically mm-hmm something like

that

yeah actually like it wouldn't take long

like a normal human probably be able to

figure this out but it wouldn't take

long for slim to realize that he has

telepathy cool can he communicate with

the ship he hasn't tried mmm he's just a

he's just a junior officer he's not he's

not important yet whose retainer is he

mine I think I own like 90% of it

retainers well it's charisma base but

also don't forget that like the

retainers only belong to players for

like organizational purposes right they

they don't belong to them as far as like

the hierarchy of the chain right anybody

can order any retainer around right they

will they will obey so yeah there's now

an army of undead swarming across the

island they're gonna end and toad is

gonna use the rest of the chain and

fight these guys off because they're

there they're just Gallatin there they

could one chain soldier could handle

several of them but they're dug they do

not seem to end and so the source of

them is the giant skull that's which

this is what is drawn that's like the

nose hole and the skeletons are pouring

out of those yeah okay elephants right I

think we can just like walk our way to

push them out of the way and they

crumble

well they'll stream past you and they'll

go after they're more interested in the

book okay

what Heslin it's a lily they largely

ignore you as you as you take the beach

and when you say interest in the boat

like they're chopping the boat up well

right now they're they're fighting the

people on the boat a lot I try to pull

it it I stay our boarding

there's committee let it be stopped I

some but what happens once they've

killed all of the chain rank-and-file

you don't know many of those

don't worry sir I'll patch her up if

need be driver the Bhutan brains

maybe they don't want to drive it they

might just want to hack it up maybe well

we got stolen right so yeah let's get in

the skull shall we yeah system juiced up

from this last fight so he's just like

running in swiping at skeletons going

straight for the nose every time every

time you hit a skeleton explodes around

so be yeah are the are the eyes problem

no the eyes the guys are higher up so

you have to climb you have to climb up

to get in through them

but I I'm willing to get considering how

I drew it I'm willing to consider that a

a narrative flourish on the tactically

it doesn't take anymore it doesn't take

any more movement to get into the ice

and it does any other way

well if I actually know the giant skull

then probably what if I just took out a

flash board or youtube comment now that

now that now that we have the chain on

our second channel our YouTube comments

are a lot more allow less frisky we're

gonna say something I'm just saying cuz

if I'm going oh D is coming with me sure

yeah me other thing he does of course

yeah it'd be pestering me yeah I don't

think you have a choice no no no I do

know you're as far as the mechanics of

your class are concerned you may be able

to leave your familiar behind but but as

far as the narrative of your dude he's

sticking with you

I need him he reminds me of why I was

once he loves her running away yes yeah

so let's see one two throw there's six

of you now yes roll a d6 and I don't

have to ignore any numbers so one two

three four five six

[Music]

[Laughter]

make a wisdom set

oh my so I'm gonna burn inspiration when

do I do it I mean anytime it's up to you

it's your inspirational can I roll and

then do it or do I need to roll both

same time I think you have to decide and

then roll okay I think you know well

it's up to me 7:26 you feel another mind

reaching out to try to kind of like

massage and shape your memory but you

are you are protected by your heathen

God wow this is this is the show folks

it's initiative you're gonna find

whatever's inside this Giants go

[Music]

different dice can people see the

menagerie of dice jails he's written

that those fancy ones so boots what is

your initiative 17 it's pretty good

no actually I don't write even write

down leach what is the initiative that's

a king I awesome copper 16 leach were

you 15 digits i attain your 13 again

boots was 17 judge uh 22 I rolled the

net what the funk

are you using charisma or some [ __ ] for

your I really not 20 okay let's do

that's right what man made my under on

that awesome I love that band by the way

flip 12

12 is au or 13 yes okay I'm first

[Laughter]

communicating in you have our team and

prequel memes okay all right

there's not a Starsky and Hutch

reference all right well yeah judge you

are storming the skull baby what's

inside well where's your personal see

what's in there and figure out so

actually it'd be nice to be able to show

if I were more organized which god

forbid that rabbit holy crap

hey +42 whoever had this hi Jerri

whoever made sure that the iPad was

charged let's see if I can just type in

this word well it's got a Wikipedia

entry Wow

oh wow yeah it's obviously from earlier

editions oh here we go

so this is what you see judge upon

entering this so the cave it was a giant

empty like literally a skull like this

obviously it's not just a random cave

formation you can see where there would

have been teeth at once along the edges

and what appear to be like places where

muscles were once died and then there's

just a bunch of screens and shale

forming a mound and you see the mound is

there's a point where it stops being

rock and turns into a bones like a lot

of things have died here and on top of

that pile of bones like a dragon on its

hoard is this thing it's got its got its

displacer these tentacles which are

squid squid tentacles yeah so you

and eat I said I don't have obviously

the mini for that because what it's it's

as you see large it wasn't last week I

said I wish I got higher you twice that

would be good because then I could fire

you once so this is a G Hydra MIDI

donate it to the collection why my

friendship thank you Jim

it's it's um it's like as big as big

okay all right cool I'm gonna use my

bonus action to put steel on it so and

we determined that well actually I got

ya there alright so that was my last

deal cuz I need to make as many as happy

with something else

um back that's a seventeen plus

eight to hit so 25 to hit are you just

missed yeah I fell for that my friend

Jim when you run sweet when somebody

says I rolled a seven thousand on the AC

he's like you miss by one yes I got

sixteen sixteen so glad you're here why

don't you guys keep track of damage to

this thing using whatever method people

have asked about this before yeah I

sometimes depending on tack in the

airplane on a simple or complex battles

I just have the players track their

damage and then I just check every once

a while to see has that total equaled

the total monsterettes makes my life

long actually and it's all data the

players would have anyway if they wanted

to they could sit there maybe try and

they sometimes do they

go away didn't you do this much tighter

this much I've done that much just say

it's not information he wouldn't have

and if the monsters have resistances

that I just frontline I adjust how many

points I have all right close enough

because I started outside the cave was

right there then there is a movement to

also move and okay well what do you that

movement did what do you have uh Lucy

long casts a spell on I ever steel on

them language like is your forked tongue

could I instead use my mighty pit dice

for a javelin bro sure

oh yeah it's just like you yes correct

you want to cash in that earlier tackle

yeah for a javelin success right I only

so you didn't do you didn't do the

damage you thought you did you did

[Music]

pretty good is this thing like attached

to the ceiling like it looked like it

was a it's just nice it can move and

stuff not it yeah it can move it's it's

it's got limbs but there were like times

got tentacles right it kind of looked

like it was hanging from the ceiling in

the picture it does have climb it can it

does it's self-evident by its structure

that it could they could if it wanted to

climb up the ceiling but currently it's

not gotcha a judge do me a favor yep

make a with that's me 9 what judge

disappears and reappears back on the

somnium two numbers

yeah here it's look it's it's toad and

there's a skeletons everywhere and I'm

battle there's lots of skeletons dead so

far look the crews seem to be I mean

technically like only one or two rounds

has gone by but they seem to be

weathering the storm well and they're

confused as to what you're doing back

here I'm doing we we saved this yeah you

see judge go he's not there

huh teleport thrown another sure when

extra crap keep dashing I'm just

sprinting in there both swords blazing

yes under anything whenever it talked me

out of existence back onto the boat it

doesn't appear to have done so there's a

17 hit yes in fact 17 is its armor class

lovely mm-hmm right

since I'm fighting alone one might say

I'm in a duel one might say that do it

[Music]

you don't have to wait the battle

doesn't have to be right in front of me

it could be more in the middle of now

makes it easier for everybody or at

least it makes easier for some people to

stop earthquake 29 plus 5 29 plus 5

damage 30 40 HP for damages Wow 34 to

that and then good messy I'm suppose and

I don't get my my offhand attack as well

18 plus 8 18 plus 8 is more than 17

true so that's another 2 damage and I

will spend a point and distract it so

the next put a little chit next to him

or something the next attack against him

jazz has advantage okay now let's see

whoever's next not your next to type

correct no not mine exit area visit next

the next attack before my next turn okay

has it been you know

wait he goes away but the ball had not

disappeared oh no he's doing illusions

onething does that make the advance

thing go away how would you know that

hear me

yeah I'm just given that you can't see

your enemies are you done yeah I'm just

kind of looking around this I guess a

nice car by the way how can you see I

see lucky yes this dark in here it

started her hey you're in the Underdark

and B that's here inside a cave inside

the America I was so as we were getting

off the ship yes I had got the torch I

know I had the commander cast light on

my sword so I work off the spell that's

a Kendrick mr. boots copper mm-hmm let's

shoot the space when he just was I have

done that before

I'll try that

I seem disappear and I I know I've tried

it before where I shot invisible spot

I'll try it again

our role just attack with this advantage

[Music]

well right to get right up on my attack

that was 13 well there you go

no what's disadvantage crap 1717 is what

you need go ahead and all damage you see

coppers shoot two arrows the first one

just scatters into the pile of stone and

bone and the second one it hits with a

bud and then disappears ah look it's

become part of some invisible creature

in there by their bike it itself is

going visible okay so you still that atm

I will assume I kiss ya and I'll tack

with big cat with disadvantage I tell I

tell her to go that way cuz big Canada's

obedient is that it is that it for

copper and big cat that's it okie-doke

leach what do you do uh where my I'm

kind of what I've seen anything that you

saw two of your team one of your

teammates and your teammates mount you

saw the lieutenant and the and the chief

Mouser run into the skull that's true

that's true but I saw this is right so I

said copper fire in there so could I

could I can't probably had I dark vision

too so I can I've got saw a vision

awesome good so uh I could probably

agonizing blast from there right I mean

you don't seem out to move over like 10

or 15 feet I just move over in it yeah

you go the race shoot through the nose

yeah right

oh no it's just yeah yeah towards the

towards or nothing track you can't see

it so you can say you're attacking the

darkness is attacking yes I am

definitely is attacking the nothingness

it's better than the darkness

sannan-san new album by the darkness

coming out to take the surface really

yeah say stirrers Kent's mist I miss I

missed on that one okay as far with my

next one Oh

+6 on there oh I'm all set seventeen

listen 819 on that but I go take a

little and rested and seventeen go ahead

and then damage

one day 10 plus 3 I 9 10 11 do not

record that in so you see two arcs of

like glowing gold napalm arc out from

leeches finger as he calls upon his

patron and they harmlessly against the

pilot moved over hiding that's not gonna

call out of the hey light up this if you

believe the day which is what I can't

read I mean I not quite sure what to do

I guess let move me into the like you

know just here no no I like over over a

bit like there what I'll do

what I want to try to do is you said

that like the floor is just covered with

like a little bone fragments and [ __ ]

like that yeah it's so it's like it's

like it's all the the bottom of the cave

is like Beach except instead of sand its

pebbles much larger and then when you

get in here

it's mixed with pebbles mixed with like

long flakes of shale and then as the the

mound starts off at the lower level it's

all pebbles but then it turns into bones

mmm skeletons good things so what I'd

like to trim into this - I'd like to

take like the flat of my sword yeah and

just like wipe it across like a bunch

and try and make like a spray of boons

true to see you can say see if I can see

where the where the where the bits just

yeah sure um let me see what that might

be like sleight of hand maybe you know

so I will try to think of like what that

might be

mmm to see if you can well roll a d20

risk comes to worse if you roll like a

three we don't have to worry about a

workout oh I won't - okay so whatever

skill it was it you successfully kick up

a lot of screen a lot of stuff but it

doesn't it doesn't fall in any pattern

doesn't appear to intersect with any

enemies okay well then I guess I mean

that's it for my turn King

for the wrecking boots here right well

boots right about nothing he just had a

hunch that you know he's a drow guys

from the underdog so they've got to have

some way to deal with stuff ood salutes

had a hunch palm isn't whether put

together scare to she thought the other

thing I remember is what time room

yeah I'm gonna ready a spell okay if I

see him I'm gonna fire a fire wall okay

well you are free to cast a fireball

because he is right oh I'll make good

busy attacking me first

he is attacking you okay but I think I

don't know how do you have you looked up

readying in action does it is it a

reaction does it go off before okay you

have a reaction while it's your turn

that seems unlikely but who knows I

don't know how does that work like how

does he taste now hello Django did he

hold his action or something the the

critter yeah well he moved and then held

his attack and waited basically did what

Lars is trying to do check a trigger

she's a nanny since choose an action

that he'll make that you will take in

response to a set trigger taking the

action uses urea haha gotcha

okay uses your reaction okay so you

haven't got a reaction yet still your

turn he's using his reaction ago and he

smacks you four times while he's gonna

attack we'll see we'll see if he's

magazine

what's your class twenty I get let's

roll a bunch of toys let's see what

happens you said he can't use this

reaction why does itah still his turn

oh he's using right now can't you can't

you can't get the punch lines before you

told the joke I told your first thing as

much like putting the cart before the

horse it's putting joke on it you see a

bunch of tentacles whip around King but

he's able to defend himself against all

but one of them

nine points of damage and you are

grappled and you see King is lifted up

off the ground and pulled up to the roof

where the Balon auth is hanging mm-hmm

okay well go ahead you can finish return

yep so go ahead and make a DC 15 with

them probably not Dec save you see what

do you don't say I'm Cassie fireball

okay and I'm going to channel divinity

ah cumin to this [ __ ] face off at max

damage so what's the area effect of this

fireball

it's like 20-something

yeah that's 20 foot radius but imma fire

behind him cuz he's got me up in the air

but okay so can you targets can you put

the can you put them the center of the

fireball like in stone because he's

hanging off the roof there's the roof

there's him and then there's you well if

it's a 20-foot radius you should be good

yeah I've been fired away too I mean you

will get where am I

you're right next so like yeah you are

underneath him so zoom is the only high

in the air is he from me this is the

roof he's right here and you're right

here oh so it's only 5 feet okay so I

don't think I don't think you can put

the fire ball like over here or this is

all stone I'm not shift to the left or

right of them I can't do it without

nuking myself you can always just Nick

yourself oh I know the mic is here so

when I'm drawing and talking you folks

can hear me understand you might get a

half F damage huh well no I'll just use

a oh your skin attacking Sarika so

that's a 12 plus 6 so it's it's and

sorry I haven't learned my smites yet so

now I gotta go back and look at it

smooth and I'll go ahead and use hearing

smite so that's gonna be a bonus 56 on

them that's cool so you get I think

normally that make a DC 15 con saver

he's gonna get lit on fire but Sohan is

his he felt as I say best stat button

doesn't matter it's not that good the

dice did not favor

so the ceiling here is only like 10 or

15 people over here on the edges over

here it's like 30 feet high it goes like

that so 13 well it's an 8 plus 5 plus 3

so 16 so 16 damage you're [ __ ] on my

map

yeah 16 damage 5 of which which is fire

damage and then let me just make sure

when you do the what 16 damage when you

do the other needs to go do you take it

oh I haven't noticed that my drawing was

in the same color Y numbers and you

couldn't find your pen so I started

thinking six already

wow yeah I think it's all boots let's

see

did you so at the start of each of its

turns now you're gonna make another con

save and if you fail you take a d6 fire

damage standby it bites you kind of

laughs each did his head off you just

sort of ate him for 20 points of

piercing damage Oh the ballin off jumps

you it's grapple you pulled you up to it

now I know it's knowing on you judge rah

so judge is gonna make his way back to

the entrance of the cave what's the

distance repeated though and the end a

front door 60 feet okay so we use double

as movement to get there is the ball or

somewhere huh go to the front yeah

60 feet right okay is it still invisible

no it's visible and it's on fire yeah

it's on it's on fire hey what's that

what is this pelvic sirens my searing

smite yeah it's lightly toasted so

they'll hit and I'll do two damage to

and then where is he yeah he's not he's

not he's above King but I can't I didn't

want to squash Kings me he's not going

grabbed anybody that's absolutely - oh

he's - got - he's got one tentacle

wrapped around him his wife got it

chewing guns body mm-hmm

yeah I'm not gonna use my I'm not gonna

consume my steel right now since I'm not

close enough but that should be fine um

so yeah it'll be the end of my turn no

wait Hanuman is used to of these three

things boots

more mr. fancy boots which again dear

low answer your glowing swords cut him

up yeah so how high above ground is he

he's ten feet up in the air so there's

like empty space king lalana

gotcha uh see I am I had a diagram that

somebody erased isn't the same spot as

me so he's like here all right I'm gonna

I'm just gonna obably makes more sense

to do a damn it well that works put me

in the rock you can't get advantage for

me well it's not of a lot I can do with

these

so I'm strong I pull a dagger out of my

boot and I just I see classic classic

that's 14 plus 8

yeah whatever 20 ribbit is math damage

20 it does seven damage all right his

boots go oh thank you boots is done it's

copper and zinc right let me move in

[Music]

there's also like gear there's armor

there's old rusty remnants and stuff mmm

it's coins dead adventures yeah

cast on surrounded this thing right the

burning thing yeah how long's it last

until he fails to say sorry until he

makes it safe so I beginning of his turn

he's gonna get to makes it and any could

beat the burn effect go off play could

be our visit take ten points of damage

from skeletons attacking you okay didn't

even miss yeah

the where's my laser where's my yeah one

of the midst laser this dude that

convinced alright well I'm gonna take

advantage of that seventeen plus eight

land apart from the weapon you can't

even tell the difference between these

skeleton bones and the other skeleton

thing happens to slam oh yeah y-yeah one

points of damage from two skeletons

use one of my superiority dice to do the

repulsors oh I will use my inferiority

dice to feel like you're super cool and

I'm kind of worthless and that skeleton

missed me like before my counter-attack

make it the one that was in front of me

okay or between me and the yeah

thingamabob leech uh it appears to be

some kind of brouhaha inside the cave

yeah from within cave I think I hear

boots cry out something like hey you're

daft drow this thing's invisible little

light bulb goes on above my head

I was invisible that was well yeah but

if it was invisible once it could be

invisible again hey I'm gonna get I

think I have to get within sight you'll

see it one two maybe I'll just go next

to you but I'm not blot you Joe well I

am gonna cast where is it now very far

[Music]

so it's a range of 20 I what's the

little three that's 60 feet in 60-foot

range on it a cube yeah okay okay so I

mean I'm within range right yeah okay is

the range 20 feet so or cube is an area

of effect and the range is how a

distance that you can cast it so you you

pick a point that is the range away and

then the area effect what's the reads

that is that range 20 cubed first but

they're still the cube size 2 which is

20 feet okay all right - bye - bye - no

oh it's four by four by illuminates the

room basically - Talia can't benefit

from invisibility you put it on some

yeah if he goes invisible you can still

he's still glowing you can still see him

gotcha outlined in dancing lights yes

I guess he's good well he'll be my talk

what yeah Oh talk is he's well deranged

I would target him I will target him

what do I roll what I roll here we go

Dex

he's gonna make us safe basically you

might say uh I don't what you saved

again so he basically 20 and he adds the

next modifier to it okay

big idea he's affected by huh

so does that mean he's surrounded by

dancing lights ah it just says that

takarov's against effective curry a

creature attacks or attack rose against

effective creatures have advantage if

the attacker can see it and targets

can't benefit from invisibility yeah I

think it just means Halloween come out

now and invite dancing lights in fairy

fire line dancing lights is like it's

like torches it sounds like and you can

turn into a humanoid shape if you want

to so maybe some kind of distraction

ability so that's why I thought you

meant

let's dancing like dancing lights is

just like it just makes lights carry

fire illuminates him and attacks an

image

you're next son are you done bleach I

moved and I cast a spell Oh anyone

injured badly I well you all did

something right it's like he doesn't do

anything except just talk to me like am

I able to use a arranged attack while

I'm in melee with these guys and just

practice we against I don't want to use

it against them online no we went over

this last time and I think they get a

attack opportunity on you you can have

[ __ ] that if you do arranged if you

shoot a ranged weapon how we did this

don't worry about I'm not gonna yeah I'm

not going to do what I thought what I

was thinking about alright let's do

something else so that things still

hanging out on the [ __ ] it's hanging

from the roof and it's got King grappled

in one of it cynical alright it's

annoying on Kings door so misty step me

I was cool yeah crazy 30 feet closer to

that right next to big cat that cool

right yeah that's that's just fine trams

alright it's by people 5 10 15 20 25 30

oh sorry

bit Wow Thomas trying to cheat back on

Yeah right next to the skeleton

opportunity tag [ __ ] it what was it a

bonus action or was it a move move me up

to two more squares I'll take the

opportunity attack okay missus all right

slums gonna throw one of his javelins at

this thing okay oh that's hit 20 okay

and let's see here all right I am going

to expend a secure you already died and

I am going to do the trip attack says

when you hit with a weapon attack which

I assume that did it up you can expend

what superiority I had that total to the

dammit roll if the target is large or

smaller it must make a strength saving

through on the failure Enoch the target

prompt hmm I'm basically trying to knock

it down to the ground that's cool no ill

listed easy very strength everything

yeah easy 15 okay he fails yeah so he

uses his legendary resistance and he

succeeds what [ __ ]

the javelin hits him and you were

certain that based on your martial

training I would have knocked him off

the ceiling well you just has so many

legs some of his some of his tentacles

detach and other ones just grab back on

all right well it takes 11 damage

regardless did we do that already sorry

so when you use getting for the

grappling does he need any kind of

concentration or anything like that is

there an equivalent you have to try to

you have to try to escape okay

I guess I want no there's no he's not

there's no nothing it's not like

maintaining a spell you stop another

time I do here another day just trying

to decide what I want to do with it

alright I'll just I'm gonna throw it on

there javelin Adam that's another hit

I'm gonna try that again

I spend another superior already died

you're gonna in theory already cry okay

v DC 15 oh he makes okay while he takes

another 12 damage that is that is so I

damage that happens that's my turn

that was slim it's king you were

grappled I guess I'm gonna try to break

it that's uh it's you use either

athletics or acrobatics own gaming 1223

I read you on this that sorry I guess I

I do athletics so DC 16 ya know you for

yourself any go ahead and make an

acrobatics track 14 do you land on your

feet okay and so he's he's up in the air

he's against the ceiling right yeah

there's about five feet between the top

of you in the bottom of him okay over

here in the middle there's a lot more

space the ceiling is higher in the

middle of the room but there's also a

little mound

well 15-foot tall mound in the middle so

that your Tom and I figure out where I

can not nuke somebody but I guess well

never mind that was my action anyway

breaking out of it so all I have is

movement so I guess I'll take an

opportunity attack and move back I'll

move Nero D so if I go down he can do

this thing uh-huh uh he misses all right

uh now is the ball enough it will attack

slip bring it mm-hmm a nest of whipping

twisting writhing tentacles are

in your face class 30 points a damage

one for each tentacle that's to death no

that's true that's to frigate tackle ah

did they all hit three them it does any

of them miss yes one of the missed went

one of the ten tackles missed all right

I'm gonna I'm gonna use my last period I

and riposte ripoffs trust that swing is

giant greatsword that's a hit

[Music]

how much day was your husband had twelve

more damage three four would you forty

over you've advantage against this guy

why I haven't missed so do you mean yeah

yeah but you get crypto if you're all

another d20 anything in that twenty on

it hmm hmm you're really hard to hear

Jerry it sounds like you're nowhere near

the mic well thank you though for ya

attack rolls against effective creatures

have advantage if attacker can see it

right I thought that was for me that's

just for everyone yeah oh so if they

can't see it they can attack normally if

they can't see it they attack with

advantage yes

well this wall dispels active it lasts

for a minute so I think still going for

alright alright well no I know

oh sorry that's right

so wait that was oh that was you counter

attacking yes

welcome back to the bachelors thanks so

judge is gonna move up to get here so we

can start whacking on this dude and I'm

gonna use my bonus action because the

first level spell I'm casting hexed

watch them so hex means that there's no

say that says it just as it just he's

now hexed cool and so as long as it's up

it's a concentration spell I did an

extra one day six necrotic damage to him

and I get to choose an ability that the

target has disadvantage on ability

checks so I think I'm gonna choose

dexterity okay I figure if you use an

ability of checks maybe dexterity would

be one that he uses and yeah well

depends on what you guys do right like

woah ability checks right not staves

fair enough yeah so is that what does

that entail like what's an ability to

check then like um text black acrobatic

sir yeah I'll check let's go that's

right

okay that's why I thought okay so once

we get them and I have an advantage like

if one of you guys tried to grab him and

you tried your acrobatics to get out boo

at 20 so Internet honey which means I

double my mean do ya you roll your dice

you roll your dice twice and add your

bonuses ones are you just frying travel

no I'm using my grease when I'm at 36

yeah who's 286 okay 10 plus whatever you

realized twice I did that

oh sorry loksat your dice I did 26

damage no 21 plus but yeah 26 damage on

the first hit on the first hit

yeah he falls dead from the ceiling he

was already off the ceiling but yeah

that's true great song goes back and she

falls onto yes yes let's go with him

still there do they explode the

skeletons return to the mound

the skeletons that are attacking the

somnium to neveress and these these

skeletons just go back into the earth

there they don't they're not destroyed

they just are they're retreating and

there's like another 20 or 30 skeletons

come in from out there and they crawl

into the mound and then disappear into

the pile of bones I loop the room real

quick my opinion there's a lot of gear

and stuff I want some cash and I put

some cash and cool weapons what if I

close my he's doing that I read the rest

that was a cool monster you take it take

a short rest well I don't shoot fish

brawn um actually we're we're hurting so

much going on that rest so I can cast I

only need 10 minutes sleep if one person

rests mm-hmm like it's not like it's not

like slim can take an hour and you guys

can leave in five minutes like oh yeah

thanks it all you takes all of you an

hour for a slim to take an hour all

right sure I mean for him to search this

room it's gonna take a while yeah are

you gonna rest on the boat are you gonna

rest here on the island hang out here

you go ahead and Caspari Lynch first at

six ten minutes are we doing a

ten-minute okay there's no 10 minutes

takes 10 minutes to cast so go ahead

make an investigation check marks if

you're searching there what is prayer of

healing do I rolled it to so no good for

me no it's honest it's very healing is

gonna be to d8 to heal plus I believe my

ability modify I'm just outside

searching around the room go ahead make

an investigation check for search thank

you sir

yes so fill go ahead ruling you're like

let me get up here I know it maybe

they'll I expect like magic in OD search

fool me

fantasy have stats what do you how are

you gonna have him do that I could order

him you go for it okay buddy nothing yes

to use the same oh you have

how are you gonna order Oh everybody go

ahead and roll to d8 and heal I would

like to cast it on six creatures so

everybody can get dirty full yeah oh

look around this room and find something

of useful me yeah now he's not making

intimidation less 411 he'll he'll

begrudgingly kinda like busybody nope

and what do you say love Rob walk to d8

and then add 4 to it and you Elsa

searching are you searching slow

today's now I'm gonna take it just just

a cursory look through some of the

phones and see if it's my help looking

good that's a shame they gotta eat this

is absurd you know one I don't think

anyone yeah yeah these people with your

eyes lots of shiny stuff in here choking

stuff with one a slim jab once a

knocking around telling me yeah I do

want to get gather up my javelin so I

threw okay

you will make another you want me

another check marks it's better to spend

more time and look again oh yeah all

right so nineteen there you go Hey roll

a d6 six now you find a scroll with a

spell on it yeah it's Tony and really

wants to search and it wants to search

man and it's not here judge it's like my

user wants me to search by reviews

that's some pride

[Music]

clucking searching keep searching what

song do I draw for Rodia - okay so

investigation first 13-14 good road

great melody six one you find a great

sort okay it's all it's pockmarked it's

uh

is it magic

how are you gonna tell that from where

you work

what's this some I walk over to seeing

these guys just pick some stuff up out

of the rubble it's gonna take a second

look as well start sifting through this

you see ya would start like digging deep

into the twelve you find a bow a bow is

it can I can I tell if it is man

together

you're human humans can analytic tingly

sensations yeah you get that as soon as

you unearth this you pull this bow out

you get this there's this weird metallic

smell in the air

mm-hmm question so humans can detect

magic and undone right kinda can sense

them they can't detect them right

there's a difference right they know

they're know they couldn't like it's not

a targeting sense they just know [ __ ]

there's undead around but they don't

know where for somebody like like judge

or like slim if we touch something from

the main role that magical do we have a

certain sense of like and it's not too

much cool about this or like we mean

what if you ever won no like because is

the reason why we can't detect magical

things or the reason we can't infer

that's magical is because we're kind of

surrounded like that's part of us it's

it's it's not it doesn't appear to have

anything to do with what plane you're

from even like elves and dwarves that

are native to the mundane world don't

have that ability it's just the thing

the humans can do that no one in my

campaign has ever done any research to

try to figure out why I don't like this

everyone else is getting stuff did you

make a rule okay let me just photos

gonna full OD yeah yes I can I've gotta

make him do it again

I was at nine or six nine twelve they

look good would you work with eleven

eleven you find a potion top well Odie

go ahead and roll T six this is may now

know well it's but you can have you or

the impro line is this a trout is six

you'll find another scroll oh don't I

was like its animate debt okay Nancy so

I'm assuming that you know a short rest

I just have to sit there right like hey

you can search you can't you just can't

do any strenuous activity so I can

search sure I mean I'm searching it as

far as I'm concerned is just walking

around this pile just like kicking some

of these rocks and stones and seeing

like you know I found a hell it's like

you always fought by the way you always

find something like oh I found a helmet

fresh like oh I found a girl what am i

12 which is why no one can yeah you find

you find another potion and after many

spending the rest of the hours searching

you guys don't buy anything else okay so

you found a great sword if I bow you

found two potions enter scroll so we

know kind of both at it like long short

it's a it's made of bone mmm hey Leon

bow trade you a potion for that sword

it's great so can you use a great stuff

why did you guys bring it over to me

just takes like six 10 minutes I think

I'd like you to check you okay this came

up before I think on language over here

has all the string I'm saying Taliban's

can't then I'm gonna rule the ill rivers

kind of somewhere

nevermind your shall remain I notified

could I could I use this great suit

three things yeah get proficient though

you're proficient in martial weapons

you're a warlock probably not I think

you could use it uses silk you just are

you would be what's your strength I

eight saying you rolled if you're old a

20-sided die to hit you would roll that

die and subtract one and that would be

the result wets and simple other hand

crossbow rate fish I guarantee you a

warlock does not naughty as martial arts

yeah as a drow you get to use youth out

of my peers yeah yeah oh yeah well

actually I'm not gonna be getaway by the

bow it's just a plus-one though oh cool

so that's plus 1 here plus 1 damage come

on like dig dig already told your nap

I'll dig around to find it an era and

just psych test it oh yeah no it's like

the arrow even even with a old Bronze

Age arrow that yeah still shoots pretty

well I believe this crazy you identified

a short very long bow very good enough

take that you can't use long bows no sir

nice hit plus one word hit plus one more

damage and now you don't have to now you

do full damage to creatures that or

damaged all this [ __ ] you guys have been

fighting like basically it seems like

from this point forward in the campaign

almost everything you might fight as

damage reduction I could think thanks

cuz they assumed at this point you guys

have magic yeah so you say this this

great sword is like we swapped rotted

and like no it's pitted yeah it's pitted

it's old and it seems to have had a lot

of use of it suffered through some

corrosion but it's not weighted anywhere

near as well as your sword is all right

it's super super sharp mm-hmm it's like

razor sharp interesting but do I have

any idea what a potion is I got me I was

you figured out we swapped yeah I'd look

at a label doesn't it doesn't have a

label tan take a tiny skin death oh can

you taste oh thanks od

oh why are you like okay

you know what it is ID no you have no

idea doesn't identify tennis taste it OD

taste it yeah yeah he'll taste something

like a like a bat he'll lick it off your

finger yeah how do you feel OD are you

okay

punches you here it's a potion of

[ __ ] some person doing it I have

strokey okay oh thank you

I wanna know I know I want to know

you take so-so he's tiny limp anis

normally could only do between 1 and 4

points of damage he clocks you for 6

points of damage I think he seems

unnaturally strong function is wearing

and that wears off he hits you again but

this time nothing happens

6 yeah you take such points another guy

is super naturally strong strength wait

a minute hang on I know it sound like

[ __ ] I'm looking at stuff she

doesn't see anything HP about how does

not be able to cast rituals well it does

do okay what does it say they can

because it will say we have ritual

casting I looked in the list it will

list under your spell casting he will

say ritual casting a fraction of wizards

and will show you how is ERDs do it and

then look at paladin's because if I

don't say that then I believe it's a I

believe it's a glass feature once again

I referred to my earlier statement I

didn't write these rules I'm not

responsible for its in the players

hammock but I'm pretty sure that it'll

say like

ritual casting you can cast some spells

if a spell says it can be the end of the

spell section here we reach I got a

potion - there's definitely no chance

that it's another strength potion they

look very different

sir would you like me to get that potion

is in a stone Bozz

he's amaz likes of Oz you know what I

mean

is is it his isn't a thin silver it's

like it looks like the same size and

shape as a test-tube

it's made us over like a cigar like a

cigar case or whatever they say I might

take a plea I am again thank you sir

od yeah towards me please I'm not a

little treat yeah he likes some of the

some of the there's this blue sparkly

goop that comes out and he likes it yeah

he wants more he wants to kind of crawl

down in that like I do it up Oh deep how

do you how do you feel are you

invincible interesting

smacking ATM Matt Koval I need a dungeon

master sky and CDN of invincibility for

that damage going back 22 I don't know

probably gonna heal up after this he did

heal me oh I know I got like an extra 10

or so and I just lost six of it she said

cuz I've fed potions to my him anyway we

don't like me this is short rest that

we're doing with show rest yeah shoot

rest you get your spots back you get

your spell slots back and you can choose

to spell or to spend nice which uh

where's mine that's under sweet here how

would you do your hip die since you roll

the dice as we right so it's a [ __ ] rest

of it spell slots right so but I haven't

cast a spell certain spells not off yeah

these are long rest by my fire fairy

fire and Haley liar all long rest and

you could use a hit dogs to get some

help

come on Ash arrest police oh yeah this

isn't a good sign IDM cannot find a DMCA

hey happy new this you come back the

notebook hey never I have no idea where

this did you want to just use but mine's

at home I have mm ours guides to

everything you or mine I have there are

two I do I'm drawing here why don't you

just ask chap question because then oh

we could all yeah anyway so yeah what's

your question

so we fed oh dear he's a little bit of

blue potion he doesn't have identified

so he can't tell you well it says he

feels invincible yeah so cuz he punched

me I take I take my hand like actually

it'd be more like a backhand just and

Yoshi's in my mirror is he writes

himself but otherwise it's a affects

them normally um rola d-10 yeah missing

two three I've said this before

our fans are better than this show I

just saw some dope fan art for Cody's

character Bri okay thank you three huh

yeah okay yeah great just right just

remember that oh it's a potion of three

three that'll make sense once you guys

identified oh okay all right yeah I got

it does nobody have identified the judge

does but I do buy it only lets you

identify one item and it's a spell and

it's a judge would have to memorize it

is ERDs bards clerks warlocks and not a

little rinse and not ill rigors yes not

all Gregor's it's a ritual casting is

some probably like

imagine users doing judges by no means

illegitimate did you what did you

identify you do rituals all the

lowercase R this we're talking about you

don't have the spell cards Bart's have

it yeah

even educated bees have it in this case

oh my god sorry so what's what's the the

shortlist important is over slim is

gonna go check out the [ __ ] the ship is

is beached and it's it's you can see its

tentacles are slowly the the the seaweed

is still on the skull but it is no

longer active it's just lying there

pertaining to be hair you give the chip

about ten minutes it'll be able to pull

itself away from the beach and you hear

the cracking of all of the structure

that is built on your ship as it's

trying to kind of twist itself off the

when I say when leech Izzy's slim kind

of Pat the ship yeah I kind of have a

look of let's say a butler who has to

kind of like serve service master right

but he kind of he thinks he knows better

effective I kind of I will cry with slim

sir

well you're attached to the ship does

she talk to you the Navigator speaks to

me there's the navigator ever mentioned

me at all no do you think she's damaged

at all now sir do I need to look at her

okay I will communicate with the

navigator yes telepathically here and

your female voice say this is ship

intelligence is is is is our is the ship

damaged in any way no no that's fine

but that's no it's like it's like it's

like the equivalent of like skinning

your knees it's gonna that's fine there

is there is superficial damage to the

ship but not like on

for the navigator to register it right

and then if slim or if slim or maybe if

he turns his back or looks away

I just just a little look a little a

really personal connection with the ship

yeah these ship I'm not going there yet

so yeah you guys have a great sword you

don't know what is a bow that's its

magic bow and I've given you some

information about that you guys have a

potion that appears to convey some of

that strength yes you have another

potion that made your major feel

invincible mm-hmm and then you have a

scroll of anime dead and a scroll of

tongues with that scroll that's

something I got kostol I think anybody

can I don't actually I don't know how

Scrolls work like magic scrolls work I

think oh god I read about this and I

think like if you can cast the spell if

you could if you could cast the spell

ever like if it's on your spell list

regardless with your memorized if I

think you can cast it from the scroll if

you can't ever cast the school I'm not a

spell caster there's still a chance you

can do it I think okay I think well

whatever

someone if I had my if I have my Dungeon

Master's guide I've no idea work out

there it consumes the scroll though

right yes in five e let's go in your

spell all right let's bloody used to sin

right now are you sure I can't dad means

okay it means like she so you have a

certain number spells that you know that

you've chosen from all of the possible I

mean question is is anime dead on that

list is it on the list of any possible I

don't know I would surprise me if it

wasn't right third little spell seems

like maybe right up a warlocks okay this

is useless

not one you guys gonna do you don't have

identify memorized or do you have to

memorize spells judgment I had to repair

them there's a prepare

you don't have I did have heard you did

yes I thought I could catch rituals have

you cast it no no OD animate does not

really people it's I'm blind

we need a freebie give me a freebie

which is if you were the favorite of

Asmodeus maybe but you're the opposite

on your cursed should be here oh yeah

hey bubble spell I'm actually kind of

feel kind of naked know now that I know

that I don't have my demons scar you

[ __ ] someone

yeah yeah anyway just don't panic

I mean everything will be us yeah yeah

I'm sorry I've been doing so far

alright so yeah you guys spend the hour

you don't find any more magic items

you're able to rest which means spend

your dies if you want to and the ship in

that time will write itself and pull

itself free from the not do any

dispenser I need two more infants cuz

I'm not 20 cuz I don't like a date give

me a black use for something any this is

your poison taster mmm

what is by hit die probably a d8 I would

guess are d6 he'll say it's a d7 alright

thanks I mean I should have it down then

I want to look to see if I'm looking for

a d7 a little more right there there we

go

day 8 plus 2 all right

7 8 knowing know well that's handy

alright you want that's better

that went pretty well considering there

are six players for the first time

there's a first six player battle it

didn't feel like it didn't feel like it

didn't feel like I took a stupid long

amount of time or that anybody that's

all good anyway so

and reboard the somnium tenebrous okay

you know I'm huge that hit dies that it

now until quick you know a number of hit

dice equal to your level so you have

five you just spent however man you

spent and you don't regenerate them

until you take a long rest and when you

take a long rest

you only regenerate half your dice thank

you so that that's good you got to be

careful about health you know thirty one

out for yeah but again are you using are

you using that sword slim I'm yeah okay

yes there's no way for me to just sort

of like concentrate on it or anything

like that and figure out what those you

try to use it on somebody and some some

skeletons backup Cape there's only if

there's only bones there's no there's no

Skellington smash are we hope to get on

the boat slim is gonna board the ship I

assume at some point I would go back

yeah yeah it's um it's cold it's of

always 45 degrees Fahrenheit by the way

not Celsius now okay

that's cool yeah it's always 45 - it's a

constant 45 degrees on the sunless sea

tough it's a sea of stretching out from

the somnium to neveress is like a flat

mirrored glass with no tides no waves if

you go up on deck and the somnium too

nervous doesn't have decks it has like

cosway's that ring the different levels

of it submarine yeah basically like but

like I hope yeah like a like a

multi-layered submarine if you go out

there onto one of those gangplanks

there's no breeze every once in a while

there's no wind but every once in a

while there's like a current of air

blows past but otherwise it's almost

perfectly still you don't hear any sound

except everyone smell you're like a ping

or pink like rocks expanding or

contracting cool so we need to go to

this right real right please stare yes

this time we will not be fooled so

easily

I believe one can wholly still people

who live there don't like when you call

it the island magnets they prefer if you

don't as they I love I just forgot my

medication says when we reach the Isle

of madness we can't expect if I may put

it so to knock on the door and just

stroll in to the inverted Tower it's not

going to be easy to get into the Lord of

man's led I believe he has some insane

creatures that worship Him as a god and

will do anything to guard him sir so we

sneak in a know what you're saying

not just a head straightener we can't

head straight in yes sir

need to be cautious huh but if we're not

cautious we should be prepared for a

fight okay against I believe some of you

know them as Barrow hmm I don't know if

the chain over five Daryl before but the

player is certainly hell yeah

and then once if we managed we get in

win of course sir

when we managed to get the Goblin our

displacement when if the inverted tower

the lord of madness he loves to play

tricks on people illusion cast fear many

people have entered the tower many have

not returned sirs the Lord of madness is

not to be messed with

so do you know what the Lord of madness

is I don't want to say it's the wrong

thing he's not a great one thank you sir

an old one an outcast old one

sent to the tower many years ago

worshiped by the barrel what's an old

one as Annapolis like an octogenarian

points than a septa Janerio how would

you know how would you know that huh old

school slim slim just been to the astral

seat this one no I don't know if he's

been to their world until now nope

what's in the seal give you power back

maybe it's not mean yeah yeah

so King King what's the Chronicle and

there's no wits 6h 18 you can scout the

area when we get to the island you can

scout around with od'd see if we can

find any kind of back entrance

you know revelation

I know of the island sir of course I'd

be prepared to scout with OB I think

before we go in here we should probably

make good use of the wand of enchant

weapon that we got from a dead guy and

keep in mind it lasts an hour so well I

mean how long is it going we shouldn't

play it for that long yeah I think we

need to really have to do a long rest

before we go in there as well how many

charges eight yes that like permanent

like we don't need to really use it on

people who are spell casters so I would

like you to enchant some weapons if you

have the moon touch sword is that the

major weapon no no I have yeah do an

actual light switch is that the other

great sword tough sword you said is not

it's not a play it's a magic sword it's

not possible how you can only use

finesse weapon sir it doesn't matter

what's yeah wait wait or finesse so

what's it what's the deal with the the

adamantium sword did you guys it's good

for danji inorganic material it's not

magic no okay it's not leather

I mean a lot of people a lot of mundane

come on normal people think of

adamantium ISM magic it's called Star

Medal everything is being a magic metal

right but it doesn't give you possible

to hit or anything like that it's not it

doesn't give up ever it's just super

good gotcha just a super good mil so are

you saying that the moon touched sword

is not magic it is it is magic but it

doesn't give you it like it's not plus

it doesn't give you a bonus I mean

that's that's in gotcha colloquially a

magic weapon is expected to be at least

plus one or better but you can just be

it's magic it just doesn't give you any

bonus to it all right and you won't

touch swords magic it just doesn't give

you guys well I mean what

I don't know if I can even like what

kind of sword is it well this one's a

long swords you would want to use that I

don't know what the moon touch sword is

aren't you using the long sword I'm

using the long sword this one mm-hmm

yeah I can't really this is it's it's

far more cumbersome a weapon than I'm

used to

okay but if we could enchant these

babies but if you ever had to kill an ox

belongs herd would be your first choice

absolutely not those weapons with the

one but if you want to use the long

sword if we fight something resistant

what the d eight versus uh well actually

no you can to have a long sword for

defend what does 2010 versus 2d well or

2d six I like my sister on the ship can

I start every session in the direction

leach go ahead and make a survival check

he's the name he's navigating because he

knows he has a vague understanding of

the layout of the sea okay so you can

talk to the navigator non defame

nineteen yeah okay so it's good so you

guys have a couple of hours before you

get there okay let's all wait od you can

rest in four hours yeah I want to try

and get a long resting which is four

hours for me if I can well I mean we we

can sail and when we get there we can

just sort of like chill and take a full

rest of us want to get all fresh it's

probably [ __ ] coaches sorry he is he

slim you're an excellent [ __ ] you start

doing the same thing you guys watch that

to the ship unless if we want to travel

between right you can connect to the

ship if you want to but you have to be

connected to it

it needs them it needs a mind to to

guide it between dimensions that's funny

I got the map the map idea [ __ ] I'll

bring up when we do the we came back

from break which will take any moment

now yeah so you guys the the

it's some time if not for the motion

of the somnium tonight versus tentacles

pulling it through the water something

we talked about last week is that even

if there's no wind the somnium to

neveress is a living creature it can

basically swim but it's like the

difference between warp speed and

impulse powers is really slow and there

is no wind here and it's not like astral

see where you can just natively make

things move with your mind so he just

got a takes it takes a while after but

there apart from that motion of the

tentacles there's no sense of motion

there's nothing you can't see there's

just darkness you're you're a little

island of light there are lanterns

hanging from the exterior of saman

universally people working on I can see

but apart from that there's darkness as

far as you can see there are no features

you can't see a ceiling you can't see

walls and so there's nothing to judge

motion by it's just it's almost like

you're hovering in inky blackness so I

wanna what I want to do is I want to

tell the navigator that when we get in

within about when we get to about a mile

away from our destination for it to just

stop and whatever the equivalent anchor

so it's hard to judge time several hours

pass and then you hear a notification

because what I wanted I figured we

should all like sleep playing our little

exfoliating beds yeah and I think I have

one an endo I the officers yeah yes

they're little gelatinous they're like

these I stripped the beds are the beds

are the mattresses you sleep on our

alive and they feed off of your dead

skin and other and other bodily juices

mm-hmm you compete in the bed and it's

cool are you peach just you know that

the that the people who have these beds

don't have chamber pots you know you

were a slave on the ship and that's why

guts that's the rumor that's it you're

like they must know I medicate

that's why if I try it I'm gonna try

them one of their bands my bed seems

really full anyway so yeah the Navigator

alerts you and says that you've we've

reached the destination that conditions

have been fulfilled and it's stopped the

ship from further progress all right

you don't unlike normally when the ship

starts and stops and you feel alert

nothing happens it's just you didn't

feel motion before you still don't get

motion here I'm gonna take a peek out

window the command deck and see if I can

see this pile of madness you know dark

version right

nope you know it's just there's about 60

feet of light in a little island around

your ship from lanterns and stuff apart

from that you don't see anything

they certainly see it by now a mile yeah

if there's if there any atmosphere down

here is current there's no way I mean

you haven't seen some clouds or mist or

anything like that us and they done but

leach will tell you that there there is

weather here it's just intermittent you

can end up lost on a fog bank but you

guys just haven't seen anything yet said

there's 60 people they probably see us

well I think well if there is anybody

watching they would probably see a light

source but they would not be able to

make out is it a big thing close isn't

it right right thing really far away is

that we should could just be a hope we

should just bring the lights down low

deck oh right because we have humans and

stuff like that who are in the chain who

can't see and they'll still need to be

able to navigate at least below decks

and so if we have the lights down there

that should be fine

but yeah especially as we get closer we

don't want to alert anybody Aaron to our

position go dark

yeah cuz I mean I I've dark vision you

vision right I don't think I do

oh really doesn't say yeah he'll fight I

do it they'll say that's what I was like

running wanting to run back in there

after that guy cuz I was like oh I get

like an advantage on perception or

invisible people and plus I have a seal

on them for invisible enemies do I still

see the seal on them if they're

invisible it doesn't say that that's how

it works yeah that is no that's quite

that's cool yeah is never you level up

you can isn't there isn't anyone lock I

thought there was something we're ill

rigors at some point if like yeah if

they if you have their it says see it

alright but I thought there was somehow

happen somebody I mean maybe that maybe

it is right now we're gonna play we're

allies if it doesn't say that you can

see in digital creatures will seal on

them you can't yeah but I thought I

wrote some maybe it was a spell or

something I remember maybe I know it was

brought up by the community and I

usually defer to them they're probably

right so we're doing a long breaths is

that right you guys are spending a night

tonight yeah gonna spend the night on

deck cuz that means I can go ahead and

cast identify cousin something get my

spells back anyway I'll just blow the

identify spells tonight on on the new

equipment that you guys got so it needs

to be identified how many things can you

identify with your spell well I've got

one two three four five six seven spell

slots my work since he can I identify

more [ __ ] at once I don't think so

nope I choose one object and I touch it

we're gonna touch no longer story took

grades to never it it's a sort of life

stealing it does know it as a magic

weapon but it doesn't have a bus okay

but it does extra damage when you I

think no actually I think it's if you

roll a twenty if you're old twenty if

you do a crit then you can I think drain

some life and gets me question Christian

yeah so since I can't cast does that

mean I can only that's it using first of

all spells or can i sacrifice my stay at

level one variable don't know why I'm

crashing so hard um III don't know but I

would rule it if you want to burn a

second level spell slot to cast a first

level spell even though there's no

additional benefit knock yourself out

okay we only have two other things

really isn't it to be ocean light is the

potions so

oh sure you know your bows plus one yeah

yeah I've got a potion we know what your

potion well we think I mean straight

line I guess yeah

spells back tomorrow morning anyway so

if you could it's a potion of he'll

giant strength it gives you a strength

of 21 that's eight that's 18 19 20 21 so

that's plus 5 this one yeah when you

attack a creature with this magic weapon

and rule 20 on the attack bill takes an

extra 10 necrotic damage and then you

get 10m temporary holy crap that's cool

thanks for 10 points oh yes pretty rad

should've dug around that skeleton bomb

we found everything it's still only 5

percent chance like anytime we get 2

attacks now for run right so it's yeah I

can see if I want I need coppers

coachmen as well it's a potion of fire

resistance ah yeah so that's what the

three all know what's the invincible one

no eggs I made it taste it's the fire

resistant member I said to him taste

this yeah I say how do you feel because

I feel invincible

that's the fire resistant potion no

interesting so it just means a you take

half damage from fireball we did the bow

I did it yeah

is there anything more to learn from the

animate enemies or just grow right why

don't we take a break and we'll come

back in 13 minutes got app and okay the

players will disembark and explore the

isle of madness I have pressed the

button mmm welcome back so this is the

time for those of you who have weathered

the storm thus far and sat through our

nonsense and made it to the other half

of the break washing up on the shores of

part 2 of tonight's adventure we enjoy

showing off our fan arch 2 and this is

something where the people who follow us

are occasionally inspired by our

nonsense to create art which is amazing

yeah and it continually inspires us and

motivates us and now we're gonna put up

on the screen so we can all watch it

together some of these things we have

not seen before

ah King that is nice this character

that's I guess pose it's the disco sweet

is the Dead Louis beer yeah surgical

smock but it looks like an out like our

cooking a blue that luteal giving me the

tarot deck yeah oh my gosh look at big

cat yeah where's your hat ship John

Hertzog's deficit is no good like color

in the lines will make a chain coloring

book oh you already got a antsy yeah

very fire and dancing and the other one

yesterday that's pretty much how I

imagined the cat like the eyes like

there's like vapors coming out of his

like really yeah goods expression his

eyes [ __ ] judges cool yeah this is the

Lester this is like a bohemian style art

yeah I love this is so cool I would

watch that show bleep yeah chef

just like envision like the the wailing

guitar theme song and everybody this is

from today thanks Lawrence for grabbing

this this is like that is basically

exactly how I pictured it I love that

it's crazy to see this stuff come to

life oh it's awesome

are there any like announcement [ __ ] we

need to tell people about our mind

people that we have a patreon we have a

Kickstarter coming up there's a link in

the doobly-doo if you want to get

notified when kingdoms and warfare

launches we've got a second channel

where we archive podcast people

continually our wives podcast over here

we have a podcast about podcast mutts

but there's not really any way to find

it other than just know about his leg up

obsidian presents on most of yours like

broadcasting platform for yeah it's

unlike iTunes

that's amazing yeah so there's just a

bunch of these like little like links

and things that people need to know that

I often forget it's just this but you

can well because a lot of people for the

for something that's three hours or four

hours long it's easier to listen to it

on a drive than it is to actually sit

front of a mic I wouldn't I couldn't sit

and watch this I might go crazy it

sounds really good yeah well I mean I'm

pretty I'm pretty happy with the way the

audio turned out finally so yeah anyway

I guess that's it inhales yeah I'm

supposed to talk about that I don't

think it picks you up if you do that

yeah no one can hear me now when you

guys accepted the Underdark job it got

it from a revenant lawyer who works for

a powerful law firm and he agreed to

provide you with a map of the time scape

that you could use this isn't big to

navigate we said what our canvas [ __ ] he

provided you a map of the time scape

that shows the location of among other

things where you guys started and where

the sunless sea is oh my god goodness me

whoa

man yeah sorry we just yeah we got some

mini is over there oh that's incredible

is this so cool so this is a prop this

is a feel it yeah bill and it's a black

ball this is a people in chat have

already I'm 1,000% certain already

identified it but this is a replica prop

from the movie time bandit so you can

get on Etsy yes and everything so that's

what I was thinking of that's why I was

thinking of an in fact I ordered it like

a week and a half before the session but

last week but unfortunately didn't get

here in time this is so cool looking

yeah I just is what I picture when I

think of a map of multiple universes and

how to get different times and stuff

like that apparently they're making a TV

show of five minutes and I've heard

there's somebody Oh Tyco white it is

cool anyway anyways let your masters it

wasn't me of course the two parents here

would know Dora heck why are you doing

this for ya okay by the way we have

tickets to Avengers end game at 10:30 so

we're gonna be spoiling that all day

yeah a lot interstellar movies with

denim so you know that's true that's

true

dave bautista alright so yeah you guys

are do you guys spend the night you wake

up in the morning and it appears as

though the ship has not moved there are

no landmarks there's no way to tell if

anything's moved the Navigator assures

you that you're still where you were

alright ill assured all right leads well

I can't see [ __ ]

you wanna yeah I guess where you will go

out on top

so we can see out on the

of that interview of dark vision and

yeah you see looking at I'm looking at

well you see the same thing you saw when

you came up to this island except this

is presumably the real thing it is a

relatively small island named Steven

that has 7 tall spindly alien spires

reaching up to it reaching up from it

like seven like seven fingers reaching

to the sky of varying Heights says this

time make sure this time I'm sure we're

at the the Isle of madness are you

absolutely sure I'm absolutely sure sir

so as you see anything like scurrying

about on the island or like no has

leaves already talked about what he

knows about this place

says this wasn't always the Isle of

madness many years ago it used to be in

the Isle of magic there's an eight

towers we can only see seven right now

if you have dark vision says see one of

the towers is the inverted Tower that

would make the eight hmm the egg towers

each one represents part of a school of

magic but this is long dead sir this

island is now the Isle of madness so

it's like a ruin mm-hmm so you don't see

anything it's the same kind of beach

well I don't see anything

our vision shows you a dark vision you

know it's the same kind of beach this as

the island of the Isle of the Dead but

it's much much larger you're doing a

good job of painting us a picture with

words thank you thank you sir we are all

suspicious of the couple for those they

can't see this isn't the correct Island

we're leaving you here yeah

we like throw a rock in it make sure ah

so can you send Odie out to scout a

beach somewhere we could make land

without being detected

oh he is trying to

I think yeah yeah a ventriloquist for

the cartoon version little Hercules like

the animated movie where it's like my

eyes can I see I can't see through can I

I think you're on the same plane okay 77

or yeah yeah yeah yeah as an action I

can still hear what it does but no with

my senses and grieving to start my next

minute but I guess I can just do it now

all right so yeah I can't I can see

through his eyes when I send them out to

scout sorry Odie I want you to fly over

to the island madness and look around

and I will be able to see exactly what

you see wow you're such a little [ __ ]

now go it goes the complains at grumbles

okay you can hear it's voice trailing

off I guess I'm the same while he's seen

so it's uh it's uh it's it's a ruined

City it's a small ruin city there are

streets and so so you see that bleach is

just kind of like zoned out mm-hmm and

yeah it's like you're applying a very

easily distracted drone the city and

there are apart from the seven powers

there are buildings like people used to

live and work here and they appear to be

made of coral or some some seashell type

material there's no there's no wood or

stone or metal once you get onto the

island proper it all looks like a lot of

it has that kind of like the inside of a

clan like that opalescent look

and it's the the towers are they were

built by the old ones so they have this

kind of weird geometry where even if

even if OD stops and hovers it looks as

though the towers are shifting like

you're able to see like you're able to

see more than just one side of them at

once like you're able to see multiple

sizes of them simultaneously and these

different points of view are all

competing with one another to be the

primary one and in the middle of the

island there is this like your

characters wouldn't think this but you

would if you can see it it's like Roman

temple like circular it's like circular

with a square like a antechamber but

there's like a bunch of pillars and a

dome and then some kind of building that

the temple is has as part of it does it

do you see any critters any inhabitants

I don't know I do I

I'm not sure so from above if you're

like fifty feet in the air flying over

you see the dome a square building built

into it and a bunch of pillars but apart

from you could if you send your imp in

you might be able to see something but

not from up here do you remember why it

oh dear oh dear

yeah you can yeah oh well he picked me

you should know he picked his [ __ ] work

and pick it he picked it hmm

right but he's how far away is he now

because while he's within a hundred feet

of me I can communicate with I don't

think that's really because you're voice

of the chain master I think says that as

long as you're on the same plane as

you're familiar you can see through its

eyes and speak through its oh okay okay

so I always that's getting it yeah as it

yeah I can go visible as an action he

imagined he turns invisible until it

attacks until its concentration ends any

equipment near wares or cares is

invisible with it okay then

I guess let's tree send him in into the

temple I let I assume or at least

employs the top of the in very sour

that's signifying way you could go make

a history show make a do I remember the

notes like Matt gave me track yeah don't

you have the notes somewhere maybe I

didn't tell you this well it's gotta be

it

well that's what I'm gonna sue well I

guess I can't talk to you now is leach

because I'm still in a trance

why can't you I couldn't you have any

trance kind of know that you can't use

your eyeballs cuz you're seeing through

here at the new talk okay

can you can you fly in a little lower

and like circle the perimeter of this

temple how many entrances there are I'm

gonna telepathy me I guess talk to I

would be and say Odie

turn yourself invisible and but then

they won't be able to see me that's

exactly right

Odie even though we might have our

moments together you are of use

sometimes yeah I'm almost again and fly

closer to the temple that you can see

all right there are there are Darrow in

here mmm-hmm they are there's a like a

doorway so there's a an open air lock

almost like an atrium right and in there

is a sculpture of an old one like a

marble statue what does that look yeah

was that look like it look like a OD

shrimp described

oh my god Barbie I'm not pulling out my

Barbie that's the wrong that's the wrong

speed that was I did I spent the entire

weekend sanding Barbie's panties because

Barbie might have panties but look do

poop definitely does not suspension of

disbelief would not be maintained if the

god of the coils rocking a bunch of oh I

knew it

what's that mean what's that mean that's

a no that's it's a little bad [ __ ]

news is that's what's with that is yeah

that's a little damn man that's he

prefers to be known as the lord of I

just get these headaches hmm yep that's

one of them okay it doesn't sound like

it looks very good description there's a

sound there's a archway is it looks like

it might be about ten feet wide hard to

tell how tall it is maybe 20 feet tall

and the archway leads into the building

the square building that the atrium

abuts and there are two heavily armed

Derro guard outside this is a fact that

place is under water okay well that's

that's the entrance that's the way in do

you think there's a straight way in and

yet the way in I send him around the

back yes let's have OD I'm kind of scout

round and see if he could see any other

way

doesn't even be any other way and the

building appears to be the square

building appears to be solid solid Coral

didn't we get so you only saw the two

Daryl no I think we saw two heavily

armored Aero guarding like the entrance

so I'm gonna see is the invade

going down but that's just Dara in that

or why sounded I mean you can or you

could you could use it's up to you what

you do with your hip like what has he

seen more than two Farrow at this point

he hasn't gone in through the his

accounting of the building he's only

gone into the atrium but like all the

other buildings outside around the

centre building like where that was

empty

yeah those are all bad yeah okay might

not be too bad you can send him in a bit

further right he's invisible

did he happen to see if there's a good

spot for us to park the boat for all

this there is no you're enough to be

truth well I'll get up close enough so

that we can walk down the bed yeah yeah

did you did you see anyone did you see

anyone around in in the streets in the

ruins on the way to this I don't think

he did no Tommy Oh devil yeah I the temp

alright alright so I think we can gear

up in deep oricon yeah the other thing

right this tower goes down right the

islands on water didn't some of you get

some Scrolls of swimming underwater I

wonder if there's another entrance and

it actually gets us to the bottom to the

Lord of Manson's go in just right

right lar we doing a heist yeah so we go

into this bottom there's the Lord of

madness at the bottom we don't have to

go through all these tricks and

illusions and traps do we get through

him we just go in if there is an

entrance down there but someone would

have to go like use that scroll of

wherever it was breathing underwater and

go and check it out and I think the IMP

can do that right so I think it'd have

to be one of us

well the thing that the song risk is on

isn't water though it's like black or

something like that it's it's it's water

but it's oily it's got stuff in it

alright just pollute it

yeah cuz you know how you would see when

you went down there right I mean the

water is not it's it's not black it's

just polluted so you guys can see into

the water you can see the phosphorescent

creatures that call it home and glow I

mean I mean they have to glow if nor

does a mate and stuff like

to see because the waters but how many

scrolls that we go you have two Scrolls

of water breathing okay so that means

that means two going each each each

scroll has the spell water breathing

I want everything affects up to eight

people okay I thought it was an hour but

I think somebody told me that it was 24

hours that's pretty good nice but we

have no idea how far down inverter goes

I don't I don't think I know that

as leak yeah well and we would need to I

don't know is is there any water

are there any water features around this

temple building that might lead down I

don't know it is how do you see anything

on that ad I asked him to the ground he

flies around and where there are lots of

buildings around but they're mostly like

simple one storey buildings I don't

appear to be any other and the

structures are there this the seven

other towers that's true but those are

but they're just abandoned they appear

to be ruins docking sent out they just

have a quick look at some of those yeah

doc don't scout round there's the other

towers and think and they are they are

very alien in construction and it kind

of hurts

Odie's eyes to stare at these things and

try to figure out how to get in it's

kind of opposite of Brutalism or it's uh

it's it they're not made for humans to

use or even necessarily sane creatures

to use but he's able to gain entrance

and fly around inside them and they're

all like huge dead wizard cowards

now Darrow in there no no nothing living

nothing moving there are guarding fee in

very tower right so we know that's one

way in yeah to the Lord of manases

behind any other towers you know looks

like it's been picked clean

yeah like you can't even tell which

Tower is which school of magic because

there's no books there's no furniture

there's just bare interiors everything

else is being and everything either yeah

deteriorated stolen my annihilated you

know what's cool magic the inverted

towers you know

do not I thought was illusions right

some was about illusions

yeah you said he casts illusions on

tricks well the lawyers had a load of

madness loves to play games with people

yes sir

cast spells use illusion trap people

send people insane all right

and to get to him we'd have to go

through his illusions if we were to go

from the top wall is there any other way

Oh besides do what he said and see this

way mind uh underground entrance or

something underwater entrance yeah uh

copper has to cast water breathing on us

cousin cast it it's on his spell list oh

so I knew that well I don't know if you

can cast as long spells yet so we can

make what we we could decide if we just

send one to scout and see if there is a

way in run we'll go in now this is a

huge island right I'm gonna circle

around the entire thing to go down to

try to find some bat cave entrance I

said it's a long shot but but that's how

many miles is that like I mean it's not

as big as the island that your hotel

like though it's not as big as it stays

but it's pretty big and there's not an

easy way for you guys to tell like like

how many miles why does this place Maui

sighs you don't have like a Google map

so where you can look at the scale it's

just a big fuck-off island you can just

underwater

24:02 him od says it's 24 gunas wide

howdy

Cody wasn't there for that but somehow

he knows that joke hmm well the chain

sir mr. wake master well it doesn't

sound like there's any um doesn't seem

like we have a good way of like I mean

sort of literally diving underwater and

swinging around the entire island

looking for a we know it'll is this

tower in the middle so we go to we don't

need to check the edges we just go

straight if we swam we could swim for

the middle right or what we think is the

middle right I know when we're

underwater knife is on in some kind of

weird crazy shape where it's like

floating and then there is an actual

tower that goes

right that you can get it see as you

come in well as that went up yeah that's

way in now that where the lair is it

could just be all way into or it could

be an M and then it's a terrible idea

but does it cost us anything to try and

just Scouts it now and have a look

no we could save us it could save us

going through all this illusions

unless there's some kind of like hungry

critter down there but you know there's

a very good point sir I don't have dark

visions you should go first

[Laughter]

I mean any for our spells so like it I

don't expect that we'll be inside of

this place for a whole 24 hours and we

also have a second one so if we do need

exactly oh wait you said it's on his

spell lists Beaute Scrolls from the dead

guy yeah only old like coppers are going

on the keys to scroll all right goes

copper is the only class that will

eventually get water from the dead guy

he knew it inside the tower is 13 Thank

You Chad and Jerry who needs a dam the

guide yeah actually what do you want to

do captain commander it's not actually

swim in my armor so so yeah I mean what

why Jesus and here's the thing if we uh

hey yeah

rise go underwater we can't see anything

if it's just land under the water we

could just walk ashore well we'll just

have Headley's jump in take a look see

if you can see anything he doesn't need

to breathe to go under for a couple

seconds if you can't see anything even

with dark vision

we'll give you a rope if you take a look

before I go do you want to try and send

OD a little further pass the time you

don't jump in the water he might see

something else we did we saw the two

girls who M's need air to breathe can

you just go under the water well he's at

the temple right now so if you guys

wanted to do any more exploring why

wonder if I just get it because he could

go past the dark guards right just

Firefly pastor C send him all the way

down not too far yeah we just refined

him ya have to cast fine familiar no kid

I yeah cooing it that's a view fly past

the Barrow he goes on the door and he

immediately dies and then he comes back

when he goes through the archway the

there's a large rectangular room on the

other side in that room there is a

elaborate symbol carved into the

flagstones of the floor it's an alien

symbol there is a large square pool

Dyess raised up like a giant bathtub

looking and there are more more

unarmored or lightly armored arrow in

here how many - there's two more guards

in here so this four bars total and then

there are two two differently insane

dwarves that are tending to the pool

there's a large gong next to the pool

and as soon as Odie enters this room one

of the two Gyarados

mmm and look around they have detected

as presents I'm gonna tend to get attic

now quick he turns and flies away

so do I notice stealth more give us uh

your stealth for myself check out I mean

I thought the role well but yeah I wanna

hear have an OD oh he comes back did I

did he do I looking through his eyes no

I recognized the statue in there or

whatever it was it's a symbol yeah sorry

the symbol yeah making our counter check

you send them back to latest reading

instead of going on I see what happens

uh +1 on that 1818 yeah you recognize it

all the old uh Voltaire and Sigrid

sneaking email on yeah jump rooms okay

sneaking mission yeah

so uh you're not gonna try and find an

alternate entrance but it's this we try

this now Cody's back now so you want me

to guns T takes like an hour to get back

like that pal havoc do you want me to

guys swimming as well deeply well we

might as well take a look yeah

take a look you got a rope jump in we'll

pull you out just um don't twice yeah

you want to be pulled out you gonna play

example you can lift it up if you're one

okay yeah I'm going in that you're good

job you're gonna jump in the water and

see if you can see and we're gonna pull

you right back out the boat it's up to

you don't you want me to see that pluck

him off the deck with a tentacle and

just you know quickly like a diving well

what's wrong with the rope nothing

tentacles are cooler

what's wrong with the Rope well you

don't have control a rope is you know

it's not prehensile here this think I'd

just like to pick you up and Anna feet

right away you need work - hold you

under there to be spiteful only if the

pilot commanded

again maybe there is a better idea

Jenna slim / - yes if you don't think

you would be able to have enough control

of the ship to be able to do something

like that then I guess we could resort

to using a rope

I think I'm stupid just trying to be

persuasive is all I'm on guy named

trying to flex it this is a terrible

idea bin soldier yes of course I've just

jumped in nothing

are you water breathed nah I know I'm

just having a peak wait what

Oh everything no no you just gotta let

go under and look and see if you can see

like any see you in the under New York

what growth the island looks underneath

I think if it's like straight down or

goes like this is it floating is it a

floating island I have why not it is the

inner door

go ahead [ __ ] down here go ahead and

make a go ahead make it like a

perception check each one plus three of

that okay seven it's dark stinky black

darkness and all you see is like things

moving things bioluminescent things

living in the darkness you can't it's

really disorienting and hard to tell

there's no one's holding you underwater

you could just come back down like hey

you see anything somebody do me a favor

enroll a 12-sided I know 1100 cool cool

oh no oh no well you guys might be lucky

cuz I don't know where most yes 1d

please please

a monster manual another one spring you

over there

it's a player guide is something to edit

aris Borden cannons I think my monster

menos at home too or else I'd London

mine so I get for trying to earn my own

doing digging you found one

is that yours

anyway everyone back-to-back papers

there's no tag Liam so how do you

suppose this is all in here two tiny six

he's got behind you die scared

everywhere I'm looking stuff up under

war hmm smell the peanut butter

initiative Odie Odie chameleon free free

it's like this initiative leach just

like oh what's wide Lycia plus again

there is just three six

oh that three is really not centered

oh man uh that's cheap die sonically I

know it's whale but yeah

where is it mother leeches in the water

ah it's up with that wormwood it's not

one one who makes me oh I shouldn't

besmirch them they're a great company

now that nice dice I like them I'm I

requested or not sent a free you're

finally Park okay so you said you're

gonna what for your initiative by the

way oh god it's terrible sakes I think

yeah no fish ich werde stewed fish maker

doubly fish word now reading something

now close it now been attacked by fish

so yeah a couple of creatures humanoid

looking creatures hard to get a good

look at them at first it looks like to

fish with a great huge goggly eyes swim

up to you but they don't have they

appear also to have arms and legs so go

with the man they are not strictly

speaking

uh-huh lastly sixteen

yeah how many how many fish dudes are

there how would you know are you can you

even count in your role are you in the

water I can see the ripple judge can

hear the damage you take seven points of

damage leach and you are you are

grappled by some like device that has

grabbed that's locked around your torso

and has these like pincers digging in

you're on the you're on a leash right is

English yeah yeah tuck twice the type of

war

that was that was the fish dudes it's

you you can't you think you were

underwater down cuz I had surface okay

sure yeah so you might attack from below

you see much like the opening of Jaws

you see right leach being being grappled

from below I start dragging so be I the

rest you guys can start plug but

unfortunately now there's like who's

who's who's pulling about oh we all we

all are we all are slim and I will okay

cat also yeah actually you guys Oh leech

up and there's a big like a human-sized

goggly eyed fish dude hanging off him

for like a man catcher like that he's

got on his and then once you pull them

all the way up out of the water of the

man he's got the fish man let's go with

man catcher and drop some of the water

and swims away hungry yeah I was gonna

say I was gonna tell the fish to eat

them or that tell them eat them if it

could I mean it'll it'll it's it's

they're too small it'll try to get them

but it needs that's why I have to go

after stuff that's life ain't often

sized or larger because these little

guys will just swim between its

tentacles it sounds like no underwater

actually not super great so yeah what

we're gonna do is we're gonna stain your

copper we're going to what's your

nickname is leach yeah it's not guinea

pig coal mine yeah you can lead since

you have good stealth yes all be so yeah

that's all saying but he's arranger

anyway so where he's gonna be fire back

OB I'll be right back

boots runs to his quarters and comes

back and snorkel he's noticeably but not

not extremely but noticeably shorter

than he was before

Oh boots boots boots Nicky not too yeah

are you now Dee booted I'm so there

they're like sort of moccasin type I'll

have to call you feet feet long ship

whether he says before we further

journey when Odie was scouting for us he

saw within the chamber a symbol upon the

the floor it saved it's a symbol of

insanity says it's a great album that's

on bread okay yeah yeah this being the I

love madness Daryl all right can we

enchant some swords I mean if you want

to sure sweet sweet actually is that

these babies small Fiat mark off the

charges - is that - it's one charge

coming off and do we want to wait to

visit just travels gonna work just

charge the wait guys get combat really

cuz I got is up to you if you really

want it right now but it lasts if we're

just fighting Daryl for now then maybe

you know oh yeah that's for one hour

and requires concentration let's try and

fight this Oh

gasps magic weapon but probably it's

probably only being good maybe if they

don't want ya oh it doesn't matter in

that case it doesn't require

concentration with the one gonna have

this ship start creeping towards the

island okay the island galloons larger

and you're in those who can see

eventually you get close enough that you

can see it and you can sort of see the

silhouettes of the seven towers in the

distance so what what casts light down

here the walls globe okay so there is

low sort of faint it's not obvious that

it's not like a lot of the things you

see down here at the glow have this

green shine to them the things in the

water but this is a like a pale white

pale ghostly almost like it's a ghost of

a city just in case yeah I'm gonna get

King to touch one of my daggers so if I

need to I can unseat it and have a light

well if you want you can I carry the

moon touch sword Mitchell it sheds a

light for a shilling mmm moon lights not

bright light it's not it's not as good

as life I just be dim well I want to be

able to conceal it interests I wanna

yeah yeah not seen this anita hider huh

when you cast a light spell like can you

have it be different colors just out of

curiosity I think it's I think it's

color is dependent on the kind of spell

cast you are I can't have just because

red light doesn't [ __ ] with your night

vision that's interest lasts for an hour

so for the wand is it first level magic

weapon yeah or okay I guess it's second

most of all it's a it's not it's not up

cast okay it just makes things plus one

all you want for an hour oh yeah

well let's let's save it there's a

section about yeah if you I mean if we

didn't the point that we want to use it

yes make me go first and I'll just zap

you with it bonus I'm actually I

remember somebody had the iron stone I

think it okay

you gonna benefit if you're not

surprised by something well I mean

everybody does but like it means nothing

special

some so once we get close can we get

close enough to the island where the the

tentacles can make a bridge for us to

walk yeah that's the same way that it

you you've used these tentacles as a

slave if you have used these tentacles

before to raid other ships they're huge

ropey they're why there's certainly wide

enough they're wide enough for two

people to go no because that's how you

guys like raiding parties with storm

across them so as we must tread with

caution the symbol that I saw very

powerful so powerful magic like a ward

is in this island as well but we can

start so open scouting water breathing

before we before we debark should we

success not throwing me in again oh yeah

well this time you'll be able to breathe

thank you sir I guess it's a good idea

to do it now right yeah but and can you

still breathe air do you have to be in

the water it doesn't it doesn't there's

a stop you for being here job you can't

as far as I know it just means that you

can with water I got you all right well

palms got roll to d4 so I need to beat a

1313 yes it's a little spell interesting

35 you guys couldn't after all that down

here we made it to another dimension 15

all right doesn't uh you don't you don't

feel any different

okay oh my neck okay

oh yeah if you do that if judge does

that to leach then leach can definitely

breathe normally what do you see down

there so like this no no he's not okay

now that we're close to it but does the

the landmass of the islands and like

just uh normal yeah sort of it just

fades off into the water it gives all

appearances of being a normal Island

okay might not be able it doesn't appear

to be a floating island or necessarily

[Music]

definitely run scenarios like this where

the player has found other ways in yeah

I mean they're probably is other ways in

but knows I mean an island is bigger I

don't even know where you'd start to

look close to copper to utilize his

stealth role okay well assume you want

to be on point

yeah boots stay within fifteen feet nor

scout ahead

was Audi saying what are you are you

going to stay within his range of

stealth or you use your own stealth

truck I'm gonna use my own self fair

enough

how far ahead are you gonna be scouting

um wait howhow are you able to see how

are you able to see I've got a dagger

okay with light no there no there's

light there's there's dead here okay

it's like I said the buildings give off

this very faint white glow yeah thanks

your eyes a while to adjust but you

can't see here so like if you're gonna

be blind for it does create this weird

kind of negative image of what you

expect to see from a city where like if

you're standing in the middle of the

street it could be quite dark but if

you're standing close to the walls it's

not yeah that's cool we've seen that

there were Darrow like outside walking

around in the streets no there was two

inside yeah

there's one thing we should keep in mind

is that there's a gong in there and that

gong is probably there for a reason it

might be to call other zero to come and

assist in the case of emergency describe

the gong of terror in the chamber we

gotta sneak up on that group and take

them out

well here's the thing like at worst case

scenario is like if we if we trip an

alarm and they try to go in like bring

it

as long as judge is there judge can cast

silence he's aiming it they can bring it

hard and long as they're hot it's not

gonna says the reason I called Odie back

to the ship is that even though he was

invisible they knew he was there he was

sensed all right shoot we may be able to

uh we'll be able to like just sort of

the two that are guarding the entrance I

could try and run a distraction and then

you guys could flank them we could just

like take them out one by one right well

yeah I he's got this guy so you know you

could turn your you've got the dancing

lights that you can turn to like a

humanoid shape so that way none of us

are at risk and you could just have it

go up there like wander around and ever

like what the hell's this thing and make

it like come out and investigate

they're insane that right yeah they

prefer to so yeah Cobo can troll me how

often can you cast very far very it's a

racial thing right yeah the preferred

term is incest roughly I think for our

in their image features I just Rick car

after a long rest yeah once yeah for

long Rene scum all right but I got it

back yeah yeah we had a rest Jared I

some kind of war turn oh no does a dog

are they turned big and invisible hmm

they turn big visible yeah enlarged and

visible likes are blasting us with

spells and we almost died

sounds like we ought to be prepared for

basically anything so this standard

operating procedure yeah

enchant your weapons and hope for the

best well let's say everything can't

kill us the one thing that can is what

you gotta worry about

let's uh so I don't know stuff doesn't

work just like it burn eraser he

mentioned well he was invisible so it

might have been an anti invisible okay

or it might have just been like a

detective

yeah I need know I didn't know that they

they weighed they sensed him and no that

was enough for me to back straightaway

yeah Suze I never thought I think it's

almost as soon as he went in the room so

you had a quick look there like right

now maybe we yeah take him to get out in

time and probably get him before they

call for help or something grapple them

maybe so this is the outside inside yep

oh yeah we know we did we got this all

right Nick as soon as I attack or we as

soon as they see is they're gonna

they're insane they're just gonna shout

and scream they'll alert them they crazy

if they see if they see our or whole war

party right if one of us just like makes

a distraction I can get them out yeah

yeah well that's why I need them away

from the doorway so they can't run back

smell of your solid make noise and try

to get exact go knock on the wall tink

tink so that's that's what I'm gonna do

Oh yo just straight in I want to say I'm

about 30 feet ahead of of the group

that's with gots a reasonable distance

because it's enough that if something

bad happens there only one round away

yeah they're one movement away so I'm

gonna like I'm gonna get as close to

them and I'm gonna take I'm gonna take

out my glowing and just sort of like

like language English English you hear

one of them I feel like I'm picking up

some more yeah you probably never met

like an elf I'm another drought okay but

I'm not within earshot well well you're

sixty feet away I mean considering the

way these guys talk did yelling they

only have they only have their says on

the car to shoot no inside voice well

you can you can hear them you can't it's

just too faint to make out chalk it up a

little closer so we can hear a nice die

I did that continue shouting are they

just they go into the building

go inside wag Liam you won the belt we

know what he was worth a shot

no it's not yeah I supposed to look

towards the noise show something they

see you

you just got shown that you're just as

crazy as they are they're gonna disguise

yourself as a Darrow and sorry I'm gonna

disguise myself is it trying to seem as

if insane

beautiful Darrow lady and you should do

that but be a human wizard that's

missing an arm mm-hmm that's true if you

know that if you know the right human

and he forgets the right arm

they were just assume that you were you

were the chosen I don't know if there's

another way in

alright I'm gonna I'm gonna chain sign

to reach to to just bring the group back

over here and that's looking for

something I was the only I can see your

change son so what you're saying that

cuz it but no vision I think said to me

you can see it I was just gonna call you

over and say just so I have like fly OD

over and see what's going on inside this

antechamber before we go there climbing

and climbing again yeah but it's I think

but as soon as he goes in there they'll

be alert well they don't see oh they

just know there's something there uh-huh

well if you can go invisible you can

just like fly to the door opening and

look in okay yeah but everything lays

about it yeah good okay back out

maybe way too long we're gonna be in

deep [ __ ] oh they got some help or

something it's looking around mmm can't

see anything

uh are you are you over there thirty

feet are you hiding behind like one of

the pillars in the atrium yeah I think

he's now I said before that I thought I

get a this is I can while still being

sneaked able to hide behind I mean

that's the as it's like a Roman temple

so there's pillars holding up this dome

and the inside so there's a giant over

there like between where the two cell

phones are there's a giant statue of an

old one

an old one

uh-huh yeah it's easier oh you're not

invisible or anything you're just used

to hiding behind a I'm used to

yep if you're wearing your boots if I

would be let's see I'm what am i stealth

boots man well no go ahead and make a go

ahead make a stealth check its his his

perception which is quite high as 13

yeah no his naturally isn't normal

I rolled it too by the way well 11 you

notice that your cell you notice that

you're a stealth slippers need to be

tied things you leaned down to tie them

in your head pokes out from that's minus

one intellect at work right they're more

intelligent zero Oh yep yeah thanks you

think your guys not that smart

you see the other party members from

where you are yeah no

[Music]

the answer is no make a wisdom sir the

dude is confused by the dude terminan 6

how this entitles me [ __ ] wisdom

sabes no no it is the Isle of madness

it's not the Isle of Christmases its I

love with some Saints yeah we can we do

a good Christmas those of you those of

you who are hiding 30 feet away from

boots who is you know one right there I

know but I don't you know it's probably

well ok well remember the page Wars Anna

thar's guys here for some reason so yeah

so those of you who can see boots

you're certainly certainly well out of

line of sight the Darrow but yeah boots

is like facing away from you he's

looking at that and then suddenly he

stands up and he turns to you and he has

an iron crown no cheese floating over

his head it's the crown that we need

yeah perhaps this is a crown I don't

think boots is OK the islands namesake

ballad they did yeah it's basically the

same thing I've got accepted another one

of Tom's characters is turning against

us

stories getting old meet the new boots

same as the old males so I mean at this

point it's probably gonna be initiative

yep and we have to draw the but like

they're not gonna like so the the maybe

not is the crown of madness

I don't know where they're I mean wow

well they don't they know they're yeah

you know something that makes them

attack any weird thing that's near him

right has to be adjacent no I has to be

actually I think it's does it's a weapon

attack or melee attack Joan melee attack

Minutemen I tell you so there's no where

there's no one standing next to him so

he can't as long as you'll get near him

and leach knows what it does so leach

can be like talking here yeah I've got

she got that spell yeah don't says stay

away from there pal he's he would attack

he's anyone who's gone mad

so they know they know you're here they

just don't know how many of you there

are

so the jig is now up it's up to you guys

what you want to do but the crown of

madness boots can't hurt you right now

cuz you're not next to him

can we shuffle it can we shuffle around

away from him out of his line of sight

yeah absolutely you couldn't and we

still use your stove bonus just to kind

of break line of sight with him and then

see if we can show him around cuz they

know that he has allies here right right

they don't know we're at in autumn any

enough because the kind of madness they

they know that the effect of it is that

he has to attack an ally right so the

fact that he turned away from them

towards something else they're like oh

okay so there's something around that's

friendly with him I see and so we have

to find a way just just sad I just

thought of you know being under common

know us yeah so at this point these

three guys are gonna go back in yep

that's casual right that crowd immense

spell-casting the priests like Darrow

kind of herds the other guys in okay

from what we can see are we like on a

street or something like or causa well I

can drop right yeah okay so we just wait

out the crown of madness uh be

challenged us crying madness loss one

minute okay let's just I mean could wait

or I mean that I don't know if the Dare

are gonna go back inside and ring that

gong and or something and Crabtree

call them out and challenge them I don't

know if they would ya maybe slow should

talk they would say I think there's so

what is that just one entry in this

building that we can see so it's like

this where there are streets that lead

to a central plaza yeah I'm in the

middle of the plaza is a temple there's

a column little dots yeah okay and then

there's a there's a in the entrances in

that rectangle is this the rectangles

that's the that square okay look is the

now we're just being some pillars yep

you guys are it's guiding you guys are

just hiding behind the pillars hmm sorry

got it I mean I can't think of an

advantage we could pull from this whoa

okay

yeah the spells no spell is gonna wear

off because if you guys wait long enough

and they're not gonna recast it or

anything I don't actually know what the

duration of one minute wait a minute the

spell go away [ __ ] they saw um are you

okay sir

why don't we just like this place is

they designed it on purpose to be

dependent so there's not there's not

like uh there's not a trick or a button

you can push to turn it inside out you

gotta if you want to stormy Oh stormy

cuz I I just want to get in there and be

able to have long enough moment to cast

um silence on the gong hmm just gotta

learn about that ward

- oh yeah symbol mm-hmm see what that

does send odeon send odeon uh odeon you

want to send one you send him in again

well you know what the symbol detector

you want a storm or probably my fave

yeah well he said he said what it is Oh

of insanity yeah so it makes people go

insane oh it's a reasonable conclusion

yes Oh sounds like just a go there do it

there's a good dispel magic I know I

know that shooters go ahead make a

not to shoot things or even smell wanna

know do like this fog

pull my poor him he's already insane

he'll go say if he goes in reverse the

Lenzi you trigger it's permanent its

permanent until it's triggered so it'll

last 100 years else and then and then if

it goes off yeah then some of you have

to cast again but until they do it will

last

does anybody have this bill magic will

just make OD go on it yeah so no I hate

to do this to you guys but it's 10 after

10:00 oh and my impression is this I

think this is gonna be a major fight

like there's four guards and to

spellcasters so if we if we do that if

we start this will probably rattle

midnight or we can start here next week

it's up to you guys what's your plan for

what's your like what is your let's at

least talk about what your plan is what

are you gonna do so we have to deal with

that warned we're gonna probably run in

there yeah so that's the thing is like

this there's no other way in right so we

have to go through there but is they is

the ward in the square building or is

the word in the circular bill know the

word the ward is like it's it's so

here's and it is itself the off center

in the room like that

[Laughter]

[Music]

and the symbol is yeah like huge

don't touch it right inside yeah and the

Gong is I don't jump over was slim he

could carry us dude slim it's probably

they call the Lord of madness no it's

probably the call the [ __ ] murlocs

mmm Morlocks from the water come on

hardly know where more locks

that's how there's no there doesn't seem

to be around from this room to go down

probably to pool I'll go swimming yeah

okay awesome yeah I say I say yeah I say

what's going to run nobody go into the

into the pentagram have him trip the

ward and then yep yeah you want him to

go in and just bake the solver boys

dance on yeah don't Sonny touch it

sorry we're like using them for OD

faithful him you can't make me you will

about yeah you will have a baby him I

need you to fly back into the room and

dance on the symbol of insanity the

scylla all right I'll go fly in there

can you still see through his eyeballs

yeah all right well you might not want

well I've said in there you want ID okay

[Music]

they were they were described you yes

we're bars in two spellcasters one of

the spellcasters is very heavily armed

this one the one they cast kind of man

he's got like breastplate on and it is

like a war award arrow and the other one

is very like varmint it just got like

leather and yeah oh oh it is Odie

invisible or visible

let's make him invisible

well visible when you when you send him

in you hear one of the Darrow start like

shouting

dah oh come here as well Connor yeah

well I mean you can hear it

are you all can hear it yeah what's he

saying it's it's to echo in there and

you know unless you're in the door where

you probably won't make it up why they

get here through ot right yeah yeah

that's true so yeah he says the alarms

gone off oh okay so they might they

might not fit they might not video that

they can actually sense him there's a

dev almost like a tripwire of some sort

here you know what I mean relays I don't

not that but or is the symbol the symbol

of the trip because it's right next row

graves caught that one thief will it be

to buckle uh-huh it's just a first

little spell okay okay yeah he just cast

alarm and somebody walks in person

castles on the thing right now he can

they were gonna attack him yeah he's a

newbies invisible right so they know

he's in here but they can't see him yeah

but he's dancing I'm dominating so this

guy casts a spell and Odie is outlined

[Laughter]

and the guards are just gonna move an

attack but the symbol doesn't go off /

they're gonna kill your room when they

move in to attack them yeah I'm gonna

fling a fireball on them oh where are

you huh okay I'm gonna step out and do

it

put yourself either within line of sight

and wait you bet at 500 d yes [ __ ] but

still going you go undying before da

truth

so put your mini where you where you

need to be in order to have light you

don't mind a side to that where would

you be and it's the perfect trap we got

together what are you with the rain I

assume Lila fireballs got some crazy

yeah okay so that'll be where we start

things next week with King I think we

all position ourselves

yeah well dissipation of next week I

will have a new mini next week cool you

saw its mini we saw some of the green

stuff looks really good yeah thank you

that looks cool but having one do like

being of having to mod it to make air

and then also you modded it so he's

holding his he's holding a sword he's

about to draw the other sword from

behind him and he's got like the little

Cape thing going over shoulder sash I

gave you know this is my table

I gave you my other table so you can

have a table Oh No

anyway table wanker hmm

oh my god back with the B room are you

just kind of charming yeah look we got

me in line of sight of that guy so

you're right

actually I'm gonna go up over there with

slim here's this way it's easier for me

to super honest so you'll get you'll get

your fireball off and then we'll roll

initiative and that'll be the normal

beginning you guys are out there but

they're not yet scrambling to fight yeah

oh you need to stop for the children

[Music]

anyway yeah well he hates listening to

me so by the way this is I'm gonna this

is the basic layout of the room the room

is actually larger than this okay so I'm

between now next week I'm just gonna

redraw it to be the right shape but

everyone's gonna be where they are it's

just that some of the Rangers are gonna

be different it's not like it's not

twice this he's gonna redraw it so that

it's large enough that the fire ball

doesn't hit anybody used to he used to

say like Advanced Dungeons & Dragons

firewall didn't list it listed its range

but it didn't list its area of effect it

listed I did list it's a fact but in in

cubic feet was like eyeballing things

yeah so you had to sit there and do like

a cube root to figure out what's the X

by Y is it just 20 by 20 great

independent like and yeah and when you

can tweet we often would calculate it

and be like this is huge this is gonna

clear out this entire floor yeah I think

it's gonna fill up this room and go down

the corridors it's gonna fill every

and we could never we always like that

can't be right let's do the math again

yeah now we always play it's like a new

yeah yeah yeah it was it was it was it's

got everything yeah anyway cool story

bro thanks for watching hopefully we

will see you hopefully we will see you

next Wednesday night and the players

will have to brave the tower of Mets the

down and the Lord of madnesses games and

trucks until then be seeing you
