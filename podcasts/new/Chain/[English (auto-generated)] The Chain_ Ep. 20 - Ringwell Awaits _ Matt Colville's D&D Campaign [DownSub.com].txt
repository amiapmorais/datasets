in a pretty good mood

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

all right welcome to the show everybody

my name is Matt Koval these are my

friends we are all game developers and

we play Dungeons & Dragons and you may

notice that we are some of us are

wearing our dope new shirts that are now

available the quasi for free oh yeah

that's right available for pre-order in

the store there's probably a link

somewhere in the chat hi I'm Jerry's

head there we go if this is how you

choose to spend the next couple of hours

we are deeply appreciative and we hope

that some something that happens in the

next couple of hours is entertaining in

some form in some in some manner fashion

or form when last we left our heroes

what happened we decided to open a

butcher shop yeah you in broad daylight

and if I gotten everybody you broke into

the place that's gonna lead you

hopefully to the entrance to ring well

yes we shop and we found a drow assassin

who was yeah we did and now we're about

to rip him a new ass he could he could

take on the entire locker don't worry

about to tuck into a steak and egg yeah

well you guys put yourself in the room

wherever you think you are this is the

double doors elite it's a large table

got it somewhere there are yes it is

this is an abandoned butcher shop and

this is where they would cut and dress

meat and get a spiced and prepped for

storage and stuff so there's book shell

or like not book shelves but there are

spice racks and stuff they're all empty

on the walls and I guess this is

certainly we've all piled in nice cats

fireball jeez and you're dead this is

certainly the most alcohol I've ever had

before dungeons dragons I'm curious

about whether or not effects so yeah

there is what

here's to be a drow in here make

everybody can make perception checks is

that really guys are standing all nice

and yeah there they were stuffing around

me cuz we what stop why no are you

staring in the back that's why you're

like I can't it's a giant Panther six

legged Panther in front of me I can't I

[Music]

mean my bubblegum dicing new menu main

guys there's something strange about

this drow it doesn't it's got some weird

markings on it or something that guides

not so taming how much trash well I mean

on your turn its initiative hmm all

right we're just gonna fight this guy

I'm like well you don't have to you can

try to talk to if you want but I know

what he's planning on doing so its

initiative and I have already ruled

destination I had twenty two of my

perception like twenty five on our

perception his he he is half of his face

looks pale white like almost like um

like you like Elric uh-huh like an

unnaturally pale white and the other

half like literally like a line down the

middle of his face is this dark brow

like shadowy color like not a natural

neither are neither of these two colors

are a natural naturally occurring flesh

color hmm in any spectrum hmm you know

who's that guy from Star Trek well yeah

except not with this not with less

ridiculous makeup but basically yes he's

that dude from let that be your last

battlefield boots wish initiative eight

judge what's your initiative 17 that's

better

copier ten uh leach 2200 d-18 whoo

King work team judge would you say wise

17 slim 19 that's here correct so I

think that's this and this person goes

on that initiative which is I know where

that is all right leech you see pardon

me

and he's crouched up on top of a small

countertop in the corner there and he's

got a what looks like a elaborately

mechanised crossbow hand crossbow okay

we don't want to kill this guy right we

want to capture a cat yes so when you uh

when you attack you can say that you

want to attack to knock him out not to

kill him okay yeah so they used to call

I don't know the girl now but used to

call it sub dual damage you would just

say I'm gonna I mean he's the flat of my

blade or whatever I don't know how it

works with a sortable well I don't

wonder if I just called out for it

drought to drought right what are you

saying we can see we can all see you

here

you're uncovered through invisibility no

longer works surrender to us we just

wish to talk to you and and in what

language do you speak this I guess

whatever

Elden right crouch in do it well I mean

we mean whichever what which one eyebrow

draft Robbie's in drought okay he sneers

at you and says back in the same

language actually maybe I'll just write

down yeah so these we can't hear it yeah

well you can hear it we can harden

understand you cannot understand it the

dry language yeah unless you speak words

we can all understand I'm communicating

sir

I would translations you saw mine

we wish to subdue not kill on this

occasion sir that will be your undoing

on the commander's orders I think I

enjoy didn't hear any order to that to

that effect we talked about

interrogating him my and last we left

her he rose he hisses at Oh leech in in

his siblings growl language I would say

he's not keen on doing two surrendering

to us for questioning so I'm gonna do

slip right so yeah what do we say is

we're attacking to up doing subdued okay

so okay I'll give him a couple of blasts

I think then yeah oh that goes up yeah

oh that's when a side up really yeah

that'd be what I started the first one

eighteen and twenty eight Oh soon at

both hit natural pianos yeah yeah okay

you've hit an 18 and a 28 yes they both

okeydoke damage do you see these twin

bolts of golden flew fire like napalm

golden napalm us tree fire streak from

leeches hand and slam into this creature

splash and all over the mice and Sears

is armored and flesh uh well that's

what's up mate just as a reminder

advantage advantage so you could roll

that one again see if you get another

twenty that's true yeah ten again

doughnuts as a bit suspect me fifteen

how long it's very far last one minute

okay okay so with my first agonizing

blast it's a fantastic four and then

with my second one I did and

so it alright roll yeah crits mean roll

all damaged eye splice and then add the

math ones so if your +32 damaged you

roll the dice twice and a +3

Ted say 13 and that so 4 and then

another 30 yes right right

Oh math isn't any easier

are you done at the end your turn uh

yeah he recovers as he's blinking in the

in the brilliant light the brilliant

golden light of your celestial power and

then he hisses a curse and invokes the

power of love and all of you have to

make a a dexterity safe just a magic

effect yes this is Dexter d-22 your fine

is it confusion hallucinating

13 the mighty boots it's yeah 13 plus a

yeah a lot yes leach 1111 is definitely

a number ha ha

judge I see you smiling and that makes

me happy good news is slim and copper

you can still move the rest of you you

see these about King well they can roll

14 oh ok OOP Donny trial frightening no

I don't think this affects what he's

free to move around but you see these

pale white filaments emerge out of the

ground and start spinning and wrapping

around you until each of you is firmly

rooted to the ground in a heavy white

spider webs

however this area and even those of you

who aren't back it's not hey

all this area is difficult for me it's

two-for-one that was leech it's limp

it's me put me right in front of that

[ __ ] this corner corner all

right won't see where we want to do to

this monkey do it so I don't know what

that means chop his head off

don't roll its way with us no there's no

word and gift for subdue all right okay

first I was curious about something so I

got 17 you miss I miss yep 18 Wow yeah

you swing your giant sword but he is

very nimble and agile oh yeah yeah and

he ducks out of the way I'm going to

mitochondria already died hey Phil he's

in faerie fire so yes you have advantage

arisen Oh for everyone right I don't

know I don't know how it works that's

not my style fired there's no obvious

against affected creatures have

advantage one Cedric what's the duration

on it that was not better what I am

going to use the superior you die and

add d8 to my result oh so it was

certainly roll the 17 so it does your

mineral Europe for more yeah no you

absolutely okay

your martial superiority overcomes is

agile it's guilt okay so this attack is

visible 20 damnit no I didn't fairy

fauna well there's just no names

damage but it does his hell room well he

cursed you guys so I don't think so

second attack this one I'm going to do a

see where's it at

distracting strike he knew save because

we got damaged or if you can maintain

that concentration for the first no

curse is coming on although I guess

after yeah him using his curse dropsy

invisibility but it's not a

concentration not spell okay so uh 24 by

force he hits okay and I'm going to do

the distracting strike and damage will

be another 20 damage and the next attack

against him guy gets advantage just did

40 damage to me one round are you done

yes I am at the end of your turn he

pulls out a what looks like um like a

like Phil would think was like a beanbag

I don't know how what saloon would make

of it and he cows another sack oh what a

cows nutsack yeah well yeah probably

how's that sack and and tosses it in the

air like in front of and shoots it with

his crossbow and it explodes in this

dust you have to make a constitution say

okay magic no not magic goodness

[Music]

that was slim and now it's this guy's

turn excuse me well sees now I team you

he says spell yeah probably casts a

spell and you recognize it what you've

got no yeah miss piece then you can only

use that once [ __ ] for the same

reason you do he has his own set of

abilities and he is going to fire fire

and arrow at least wire and we'll see

how many at you slam okay yeah I'm sorry

he's attacking you twice the second

attack was crit and the third all right

so he takes aim at slim and fires three

shots from his hand crossbow each one

each one hits slim I don't know why I

use the distracting strike you guys

already have an advantage oh yeah you

can't get I mean there's you can I have

seen I have seen in Dungeon Master's use

double advantage now yeah so it's all

these dice and then four more I got it

comes out soonish right there's a minute

the ferry begin battle a lot of ones now

much and you have to make three savings

runs okay Constitution says okay first

one sixteen okay uh seventeen second one

sounds very healthy nineteen will Jack

damn go on third one constitutions my

best score third one is thirteen you are

poison mmm you feel as though third

crossbow bolt strikes you right under

your left shoulder mmm you feel your

blood start to burn and you are now have

disadvantage on tackles and a billy

shacks which if you're already have

advantage that just as a normal d20 and

it's the best and I'm gonna roll all

night

that was the lon it's OD I mean it's

just send him over next to the yeah next

to the drow assassin on me he's already

next to ya go and and come back again

thank you and we'll just leave them

there for now so whoever's next to

attack which I think we already have

advantage on uh well it doesn't hurt he

gets to stay yeah I mean on that ferry

father to run out though you never know

like what's gonna happen yeah it's judge

[Music]

I'm my restraint like I didn't make that

duck save and there's spider webs cook

could be I'll warm you up make it 15 15

s which need a judge is able to pull

himself extricate himself from the nest

of webs that that bound him but that's

the end of his turns king also know yeah

does it negatively affects spell casting

no no nope

okay then I'll just cast hope that on go

ahead and go with save you see 15

to actually occur in Kate it seems to be

naturally occurring hey if it doesn't

have any signs oh well I mean yeah how

would you know that just like it's not

it's not it'll see like like carved it

out like is it just all strolling all

the way around because like a naturally

occurring cave would have like some sort

of mud or like something on the floor

slag mites that type of thing anything

like that or is it it's like it looks

recently made it looks freshly dug but

it looks like it was made with really

primitive tools hmm

it's Mountain once you went like as you

head down this corridor and you can see

that it opens up into a large room you

you smell this it's like a really

powerful thick aroma of like compost and

awful and there's a tour is done mmm

[ __ ] well yeah what awful is yeah yeah

and I think also like organs and stay

right from it yeah and there is like a

huge pile basically it's it's a huge

pile I don't pal of awful it's where you

throw awful [ __ ] and rescue it's kind of

like a compost heap it's where you throw

there's a organic trash and stuff what's

emitting so I don't know it's a minimum

you sorry

so be something small like a split

second but let's see define midden

midden a dunghill or refuse heap don't

know pro-rider you refuse heap there's a

whole bunch of refuse the accept heap is

a different completely different pile

Oh what's in this one just a lot of well

I got some I guess go ahead bring me up

there too well hang on a minute stop

hang on initiative against therapy seep

hmm yeah I need a couple Madsen hang on

a second so I guess I don't get to be I

don't actually

there's the anyway for sniff be like a

carrion crawler maybe a lot of carrying

crawlers a trash elemental yeah with a

nice it's a thing mmm smell you later

shambling mound of poo yeah yeah yeah

wait yeah we fought that pool elemental

it was like a mini donor card look like

a pudding here fortunately I

do not have a mini for this type of

proxy even though my friend I know my

friend Jim it but yeah please this right

they are this big okay no she wasn't

that Hey oh there's so many hang it out

in there yeah yeah it's a huge pile of

the huge elements because they look

something like a tentacle lashes out

ignore what it may say in my notes the

post of a patreon improvising and it

looks like this well I don't have to

cover up the text it looks like it's

like a trapped you know big carrot Ament

yeah and it you see what looks like the

trash heap in front of leach as he goes

to inspect these this trash you kind of

comes alive and parts of it start

whipping around and flailing at him and

it's got multi attack so he attacks are

all that can yeah so people were slow

which camera is the one that's oh oh no

actually there's a audio again there's

an eel out here but I don't think

there's an e audio good fourth edition I

never understood why the difference

between them the object makes a kid see

oh it's that it speaks a language not

the language you know yeah three attacks

oh yeah it tries to bite you or our

class leach oh six thing I ate its mhm

and then it tries to ten call you

mmm-hmm that's a critical that's life

critical

get all the 19 around 1720 and adjust

dice I am the king of D&D the game he

wins dead a big cut that from the door I

would never say that live when we do

this for real I do this so yeah Wow so

the bite did not create you so that's

the good news that that's the least

ma'am 8 and 2 is 10 plus 3 is 13 points

of damage are you a creature I'm like

you must succeed on the city through

icon save ooh

this is delicious I love monsters points

uh what they still motive there's so

much more so I'm gonna write that down

okay we'll just remember I'll remember

13 but now you gotta make a constitution

set I could I'll do that right now 15 mm

yeah that's what you need good yeah

you're not you're not rotting to death

go anyway you guys this is why you guys

get paid the big bucks is to fight trash

elementals so this was a crit mmm 13 and

3 is another 16 points of damage

oh and plus two more th piercing damage

to the bludgeoning damage and piercing

damage is delicious wish I was a ten are

you medium or smaller yes you are you

autumns you large creatures they would

also like a bite if you oh you look so

delicious prevents me from being

surprised as I know I get to go now

because this is a surprise round no

there's no such thing as a surprise

round although what the difference is

better than that and how it actually

works I'm not sure yeah no I actually

don't remember how it's been so long

that hurt I think it's just that you

don't get that charlie bit which I know

the same thing I know what the

difference is between that and not being

surprised but yeah go ahead yeah you

cannot be surprised you are in fact your

this is those predictable thing possible

in there yeah my goatee notice so you

noticed that your master is somewhat

delightfully been surprised by a giant

pile of trash and appears to be in what

is in your opinion the most the most

appropriate fate possible yeah sure he

devoured by a [ __ ] elemental sorry

Skippy around yeah

so it's erection nobody knows when but

master scouts but goes when but ceases

master goes well when the but master

goes yes yes as it says in the Bible

when the but master goes as much as he

hates me he's gonna have to go these

[ __ ] so I've got it right there how

many I would use good I'm gonna have him

I'm gonna have him bite movies poison

but which so this is the one that has he

was active number one and we'll just

yeah yeah so there are three yeah as you

can see what it look like it was a

really big thing on the car it's large

it's a large aberration okay well a

civvy his was he plan well you know what

do you that she thirties should be on

that oh [ __ ]

[Music]

trust me well no didn't mesmerize the

children I'm gonna do that before you're

there to get mesmerised as well or do

you want to be there when I memorize you

I wasn't gonna move up I was gonna snap

my fingers and do some damage

mmm there is maybe kill OD 20 to do that

good it shows these are huge little

armor they're actually quite easy all

right

piercing damage I've never done this

before not what's going on 1 1 d 4 + 3 .

damage with that looks and then the

target must make a TC 11 Constitution

saving throat how much will the swap

swap with me swap with you yeah before

or yes I'm gonna do a range they're very

has to make a semi throw yes I'm a girl

from back here concept and I won't yeah

in the way he did not make a save me

from my own so that means it's 3 d6

poisoned mmm

that's from your imp yeah that's not

amazing damage to pin him uh 6 10 15 is

is he like poison that that poison that

there's poison damage there's poison the

effect and there's poison the type of

damage yeah that was just poison damage

the status rings that was OD its king

according to my initiative yeah we we

use the lieutenant ability all right so

where where is Li Chen that's where

graphic leach is in this we're okay in

yeah yeah basically in this square but

piping od I'm gonna kill you thanks if

you were gonna do oh dear

all right so I'm gonna knock you into a

fireball so go ahead and make Dec saves

brawl through them or all three of them

Oh to the dc-dc 15 beauty pageant we won

so let's go for 148 damage or hell over

here more often roll the two or three a

four four was the previous role and now

I just roll the nineteen so so this hunk

of garbage makes it now they're not

literally hongsa garbage they're

creatures but this garbage filled

creature makes it these two do not

okay so 24 48 24 and got it

Odie serious piece right there

yeah but you know that right you know

okay here's like to hit points ight fire

what's what's Nazis ah sorry Dex

okay really help guidance no 1313 all

right you take hey wait wait wait what's

your what's your total what's your total

is months 52 right guy took fool yeah

right so if you take is it your is it

your hit points there's a halfway point

so that was happy no it's if you take

your entire hit points entire again so

if he was at 52 and took 140 I would she

be dead if he if if he was at 8 and he

took 60 points of damage he'd be dead

sure okay but I'm not but you're not I'm

just unconscious you're just unconscious

I don't fire yes

od must be [ __ ] loving this so now

he's just flop I realize was three

things I thought you were just trying to

indicate like how large do you think

right so if I'd known that whenever I

had done my mmm thing in the surprise

round I would have instead done the

thing where I apply seals to open all

the enemies so I not see

bang this time Mars could you have done

like something over here than like so I

did it back here so is he out of his

mouth no it's on the floor uh no he's

just limp there's leech-like

mouth no he's not is it as technical yes

don't have these tentacles just on

Cochin so now limp and grabbed and

probably gonna get eaten whenever this

thing goes yeah which one's holding this

one this Brett well so if we gets hit

again okay I didn't even get a chance to

get my rod out yeah wait if you take a

damage just to doesn't those hoses are

MacPhail it's automatically a crit if

it's looking it's definitely taking

taking damage taking damages on

automatic fail you want to make me feel

like I say and all attacks against you

are automatic crits and crits due to

death it's like to definitely damage

killed by an otter killed yeah killed by

that my current cook yet something else

is great yeah yeah you guys all watch as

though it was a literary fireball yeah

as the fire burns away now the a

delightful thing is you're smelling

burning hot garbage and poo and it being

the inside of your nose and when the

fire and smoke clears you see leach is

now limp and no longer the good news is

he's no longer protesting the bad news

is he appears to be at least unconscious

I got extremely sleepy

takatori so yeah if you take any damage

value of zero hit points to suffer I

just saving through a failure

if it damages from a critical hit you

suffer two failures in Oh on zero yeah

but that so there's another rule

somewhere what which is that if you

attack him if you if you there's

something about attacks against him and

it's not even in that section it's in

another part of the book it's like if

you're unconscious hang in a minute here

we go

attack roles any attack that hits him is

a critical if the attackers within five

feet yeah so we have assembled all the

information so yeah a fireball is an

attack role like a lot of spells aren't

attack roles right correct

there was a saving faith yeah oh yeah

points but like zero yeah I know about

me right

the spells the spells not but yeah yeah

correct the spells not in the TAC role

go ahead whose turn is it it's my drink

proper and Vicki I'm gonna I'm sorry I'm

not gonna kill it I'm gonna yeah yeah

you'd make it your pet it's like sorry

big cat yeah I got a pet now like if

that thing can kill leach yeah all right

I'm gonna join helium I'm alright cuz if

I heal you here on what happens I'm

gonna cast I mean I see you in the range

healing spirit yeah so I mean cast

healing spirit on the on the square that

he's on because as you can kick call him

intangible spear to five-foot space you

can see until this spell ends when the

creature you see moves into the space or

starts its turn there you can cause a

spirit to restore head points no I I

can't heal constructs or Undead

so I'm there I mean you can conjure it

in the space that leeches in yeah but

that's five that's in the middle here

and so and when the audio loses tentacle

he won't be in that space anywhere

alright he's really like he's not like

that's meant for people who are able to

use their feet and walk around and enter

swears and leave squares

currently he's yeah they are he's in the

tentacle relation or I ate him so maybe

it might work once

like like cuz if I could bring him back

once then he won't die in the next Jose

what is your history of you remember oh

yeah leech Tamar what your initial with

like 10 yeah I'm sorry

if I shoot it open up where the guy is

is but if I shoot him that will not come

out of his mouth 10 a big cat could

maybe pull him out

Oh grab him it would be a strength vs.

strength yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

let me start with shooting I'm so big

cat can do that okay so I'm gonna shoot

the one that's holding Leach number one

number one not leach but it don't you

mean are those your seals the veins you

partner yeah it was to Barney's the

seals please yes go for beauty pageant

that is gone get off the blow all right

26 and do coming in us to do hunter's

mark on him toys are sandwich yeah

oh no sorry 26 see I do 17 damage for

the first hit 17 damage god I almost

maxed everything time 21 or 13 damage

and then I'll move up and I mean with

big cat me and try and grab leach and

pull him out uh yeah so she's got ten

foot reach also so yeah but she has to

okay well go ahead and make a attack

roll against leach

well to grab them or what is this yeah I

mean it's not the audio gives it holding

the leach out for big cat it's trying to

eat leach I see so you're gonna have to

hit leach just like you would if you

were trying to oh I see you're not you

know doing damage right he's trying to

grab them yeah

[Music]

16 plus 6

yes your honor that is so no we go ahead

and make a strength check okay a lot of

strength yeah so to see are you 18 now

what do you do 120 no all right yeah

you're able to grab your the big cat is

able to grab leach out of the audience

grasp big cat it can't really move and

that was copper big-headed slim man I

really thought it was a chance just just

a big cat possum in now for my action my

first action I am going dumb many euros

weapon is bathed in this rainbow this

rainbow energy crackles along the blade

and then I'm going to run it walk out

crook there yeah ain't got their own

eyes

Bannack or she would have advantage

because he's got the imp over here and

he's already banjo this guy but not that

guy yeah yeah okay and then I'm going to

action surge so that I can actually get

some attacks on these [ __ ] it'll be a

lot of damage hopefully I don't know

where that is but see that's a 20 hits

wisdom saves with disadvantage please

okay dokay

their wisdom is a swirling awesome swirl

of Lights about their swirly heads not

this one or two with this advantage

there were the nine in the twelve so

it's a ten as its highest ten which is

to say ten this is result but just to

say that they are both dumbfounded by

the swirling lights above their heads

and they are incapacitated and have a

speed of zero

I don't even see like eyeballs on these

things actually you know what it looks

like it looks like he's got like

eyeballs in his tentacles oh yeah there

you go yeah well he can't be right

and it does it has it has a whole

tentacle just devoted Tybalt's the other

ones have lost

he's got three tentacles but one of them

is eyeballs and the other ones have yeah

so you see that third tentacle just

stare oh they can link blink at the

ceiling

hypnotic pattern is yeah they're both

hypnotized all right I'm just I'm just

standing here just playing a nice sleepy

tune and all are you still unconscious

right yes I think I'm on big cam holy as

you as you like in your in whatever

dream state you're in you hear my voice

[Music]

these [ __ ] a bit of a blast yeah go

for the weak one yeah okay

I'll blast by for them one on the right

yeah the one on the front

don't forget plus two because of your

packed rod yeah we had it that one yeah

so I'm now on I'll get plus I know yeah

well my walking what I've got my rod out

yeah in fact I wonder if now doing a

roadie one in hand

oh dude that's a bad one ten it's a

total on that with no to plus ten and

then that one is ninety

okay well the ten misses okay nineteen

hits give it what is it that's real Mac

seven so important which wants to give

you damage as well yep I think ya know

maybe not know I thought I was like a

plus two weapon basically but I could be

wrong that's why that's a dispel attack

it does still attack some spell DC today

no it didn't say the image on the little

no no that's ridiculous why would you

know she will my swim for it

so yeah seven okay that well that's by

far the least impressive amount of

damage anyone's done so I got a [ __ ]

in there yeah I don't think I don't

think I can attack if I DS attacked in

the same round I think I fought go my

yeah attack yet I see usually you're

special because your abuse master only

can help and do other stuff usually when

you have a summon a creature you can use

your action to tell it to do something

oh right yeah blah musically learning so

I guess no damage and I'll just know

that's why I will keep it like this

called my rod away and uh no it will not

retcon it will assume it went away did

okay but we'll just remember for a nap

it's a perfectly reasonable it's

perfectly honest mistake and it's not

gonna make that much of a difference

something just hit me was that leach

nice so you woke it up yeah so one of

the arms is like wait did you only get

one

[Music]

someone is awake

this one's awake it's a ball tentacle is

still blinking up at the spinning

hypnotic patterns and this one's really

really really angry at slim so what else

is net actually you hear a voice in your

head slim uh-huh okay okay that's how I

understand this do you speak awti oh

yeah maybe you could tell them if you

spoke hovitos class is 18 right

ah so this guy is gonna try and whap you

know and then two tentacles you take two

eight sided dice plus a little more

Depot three bludgeoning

piercing that's 5 + 3 is 8 plus 3 is 11

points of damage and you are grappled

slim is lifted up into the air hole loss

I can't hold on how do I get to do

something you can't just grapple a

battle master like that no that's fine

but the the missed attack I can use the

superior you die and repost replaced

with a giant sword yeah

chinnu my creature misses you with melee

attack you can use your reaction expend

one superiority die to make a melee

weapon attack against it yhe I need two

to do an extra 1 d6 damage with my

weapon so most the time it's gonna be

three six unless as long as judge hasn't

that kinda want that okay well you gotta

be you gotta take it well let me just

you a little bit about her Lord and

Savior

swims like power strength and all about

mm-hmm that was judge its Odie don't

forget oh your don't fit now we have to

be know gonna play by the rules don't

forget how your [ __ ] works

yeah but you didn't play by the rules

that time we shall i blast him woke him

up in any crab sleep with me you know

exactly what grabs are you accusing me

of deliberately not retconning what you

had done because it would mean that my

monster was awake yes that would mean I

was very clever you still fall prey to

the like one of the classic blunders

like don't get involved with the astral

chainsaw supposed to go that's right but

goes when judge goes that's what he'll

do anyway oh yeah but my name not some

phrase going to use six that's her basic

attack it's her signature attack yeah

she hurls a bubble of acid chicon Jersey

it must succeed it on a dexterity saving

throw how do I know it's just exceed

against its it's the retainer rules it's

a fixed amount its size it's might

actually be on the card I see the card

only number on the areas for great see I

don't remember the number but it's in

the thing are you giving with this I'm

just remembering a conversation about

whether don't which put on the thing yes

doesn't matter because

the creature fails cool it's 14 to 15

yeah it starts at 13 yeah you can if we

had a copy of strongholds of fall we can

just look it up we didn't write it down

eight copies in it I'm gonna for the

first time Anna's gonna have to read

this book read the book ever you'd know

roughly where it is there's no index

there's motherhood there's a very good

very well-organized table of contacts

table contents and if you have the PDF

the entire thing is cross-referenced so

anytime you see a page number you can

just click on it will take you right

there searchable it's searchable it's

awesome

damage $10 range - no no failed so but

swears buts yeah so buts

curls a little ball of acid that

splashes all the pictures you see it's

flesh burning and that's like I think

the most extraordinary thing butts has

ever thought she said wild come in Tyson

like you got it's it's usually only the

senior officers that go on adventures

and fight monsters

okeydoke is it good on the cast so what

we're taking a short rest we will yeah

do the intro us as an hour 48 so let's

do that

you notice what the walls in here have

these repeated long thin striations in

back from that I like like a sedimentary

or a layer of I mean yeah there is there

are deposited you can see where the

layers of silt have been deposited over

millennia and that turn into sediment

but no like this it looks like someone

has dug into the walls like all this was

all dug out and they're all from the

ground to the ceiling there are these

long thin carved out top bike channels

can I cast me your words of myself twice

I don't know why you do you have to

spell slots yes and do it better you

don't feel my healthy now I'm going into

a true ll fear if you look into these

little strange what can you see like see

how deep they are I mean they're not

more than that deep okay but it's like

it's like something it sounds like

something with like like claws or like a

raked tool has like dug this out

is it like perfectly not perfect but

like even like is it like Wow no yeah

it's definitely like okay are the

striations a different material within

the rock you know I know they're like

holes they're not like they're there

something's been dug out that is they're

not they're not just they're not just

discolored layers they're actually like

took somebody took two yes and don't

like this whole cave was dug out using

other tools or jaws okay tooth that's it

they use them does they grab one of the

like tentacles we hold it up against the

wall to see if it matches the yeah the

striations and they just hang out down

here digging well you got an hour to

kill man it does not appearance there's

no correlation between the striations on

the wall though they look mechanical

reasonably so and I mean it'd be hard to

tell one way or the other

all right well but I mean like you're

pretty regular the line all very

straight and even walk through it no see

what's in it it's like double Derek Tom

you're going into the nose and you could

ask out a day to dig through it yeah

send it another wrestler there's gonna

be more I'm not getting in there can I

have a short rest come on I'm on a

trance right now I'm just up against the

wall kind of thing I've ever read you

just relaxing yeah dig through

that mess it'll it'll go in the start

it'll abeyance master much loathe to do

so yeah now it's just covered in poo

yeah well it's a calm it's a strange

combination of poo and dirt yeah and

often like he'll he comes and presents

you a giant turd I got this yeah and you

can see that in in in the in the awful

in the excrement there are chunks of

Earth okay I thought for sure that's it

I do like Matt's gonna sing his favorite

song can't go wrong with left I don't

know my books left I don't know why sure

goblin in st. so who are you going first

I only ask that because it was your idea

and you were you put yourself first and

last should I squish your mark what is

in watching or why that one just out of

curiosity who kind of it random we

couldn't find any any reason to go to

one it goes down about 60 feet at widens

that's 30 feet wide and that 30 foot

wide part of the caves the tunnels

itself goes about

50 feet down and then closes off in 2010

appears to be a dead end I'm just gonna

just go circle around the edges just to

see if there's any kind of social secret

door yeah you hold up the palm on the

blinking eye does not reveal any hidden

doorways although you do notice a small

pile of this small pile of glinting

gleaming material near and near the far

wall it's a pile of gems a bundle

does anybody how they detect traps or

anything in this how you detect traps as

we send out again that's true we did

that okay you can do if you like no Dave

fetch one of those gems for the gems

it's right it's unlike anything the

judges just kicked like it's when you

want to send him in I mean he'll go pick

the gems up off the floor I see yeah

that's one yeah okay it's quartz just

been put but when he put the ones he

brings he was a big chunk of quartz

naturally kind of mind thank you looks

like it was broken off of a larger thing

is it all quartz are you gonna sift

through the pile of it

no it looks like there might be some

other gems in there it's mostly quartz

yeah ain't done what's the shiniest one

in sorry start like picking through it a

drink yeah there is fifty five gold

pieces of tourmaline in here tourmaline

in okay but the rest is worthless quartz

that's five Cup it really don't take

that yeah by the way I know all of you

folks know this but the people watching

don't know that I have after several

attempts on my part to come up with a

list of examples of what you can do with

the treasury die I have the rules for

using the Treasury die and rolling

negotiation and when you increment it

when you don't increment it and then the

hard work of actually listing all the

different things you could buy with

including we want buy a castle we want

to bribe an official and we want to pay

upkeep on our

units and stuff like that I was like

this is so tedious I don't care anymore

I said screw it you guys have a lot of

money so yeah the trash oh yeah the

actual that they don't have a Treasury

die anymore what they were Treasury it's

got fifty three thousand gold pieces in

it what did we spend it on Tanana yeah

yeah so that's by the way that's how you

know that it's bad design is a you are

to you consider it too tedious to finish

your own idea and the equivalent is like

whatever haven't have to write a chapter

in my novels and I'm like God I don't

wanna write this chapter it's so boring

I'm like I need to spice um up something

somebody's gonna die is there anything

else on the floor in here is there any

more of like the sort of Rocky poem you

gonna how are you gonna just by glancing

around you don't notice anything I mean

I've got my I've got my little bead of

light and I'm just kind of was walking

around go ahead and make a make a search

check investigation investigation that's

that's a that's a whole thirteen

thirteen you notice that the wall in

front of the little pile of stuff that

dead end part of the corridor mm-hmm is

a very different texture than the ran

what kind of what kind of a texture it

looks so the rest of the walls down here

are roughly hewn limestone rippled with

chalk and lime stones are a porous stone

so it's very rough right like if you ran

your hand across it you might cut your

hand or parts of my crumble off but then

this part in front of you it's about

five feet wide and about roughly ten

feet tall is it's the same material but

this is smooth and rippled like almost

like the sort of like you open up a

sharp peanut butter it's got that kind

of its if there are ripples in it but

other than it's very smooth hmm what is

nice um was cemented over it what well I

think they just found a pocket of

polymaths

one they just gifted another 50 subs

not even their main account why there's

a wannabe henshin oh yeah Kenny last one

so I sports is like you all don't

deserve it well died but I don't know

that we do but alright thank you anyway

[Music]

it's like you collected there's an

organic transition but it's the same

material same limestone material yeah

but he just instead of these like

scratches these like grooves in it oh

yeah there are no grooves there are no

grooves it's like you're playing

Minecraft you dig in and then you find

this pocket of gems a little we still

have the adamantium sword will you get

that back to your the Billy Idol sword

more evidence living thing might have

made this so that's good that's good

there might be a creature that is

burrowed around in here but besides a

bitter or what digs through the closest

one go back and see other butcher shops

it's 8:50 we don't take a break at 8:30

and I want to wait because we started

late and so now I think we're gonna take

a break and go sober up and yes actually

a mantra he will eat the rest of the

cheese's

so we'll be back in about 13 minutes and

then we'll hang out and look at some of

the dough art that some people have made

and then they will continue to explore

this doll ice board's gifting pencils I

think I can it start break yeah break

come back to your rod any hello hi

welcome back everybody I hope that our

break wasn't too long what do we what so

what do we have announcements or

anything that we do after the break for

the shirts these dope shirts designed by

by Tom by Tom schmuck legible yes you

the we're trying something else we

actually have no because we don't know

how many of these to make because we

don't know if anybody wants any so it's

like do we make out like 100 or

one hundred or a thousand we didn't

really have a good sense of what kind of

demand there might be and so we did a

thing I was a fund of hire whatever

those banners yeah so you go to our Shan

stores it's a it lets you kind of

preorder it and once we hit a thousand

pre-orders and we go okay people want

the shirt and then we make the shirt so

this and then it's entirely likely that

the next time we do a shirt we won't

have to do that because we'll have a

pretty good idea how many shirts people

want I will warn you that shipping is

pretty pretty rough on this one it's not

cheap but we're doing our best and we

will and it's learning this is a whole

new interface new company with

fulfillment em and we are constantly

learning and trying to find better ways

to do this stuff so yeah the campaign's

up for a month yeah it's up to joy joy

18 I believe I think so yeah yeah and so

also people make dope art based on the

nonsense that happens here and so we

have a button here called fan art and we

tend to stop and look and see what

people have made and I don't know if

I've seen any fan over the past week am

i evil what we are do I not tell you

that enough like we're must even a guy I

know

I guess I giving you the bird with his

tail leech is such a great cares calves

Montreux is saying that the eyes are

actually it's actually pictures from the

moon yeah exactly if you lose ooh

for too long that's true correct yeah

that's correct yes they wrote down was

that is it right every okay over there

all right so kids turn this bus around

yes anyway yeah their pile of gemstones

wall strange smoothness judge you check

out this smooth part of the wall four

doors well so treads looks the sword

plumb old to see if anything happens

never that's it well it's a great door

it's just there's something that they

either covered up or Nemo is covered up

it's a discontinuity in the I'm gonna

I'm gonna like what about those other

two sort of you touch it I'm gonna like

kick it just like what's your

Constitution bonus my Khan bonus is a

two all right

continue you kick eat you you see boots

smack this thing with his with his boot

he boots boots boots

how solid does it seem super solid like

it's literally just a wall of stone yep

how much more stone

to be none more stone all right this is

just uh should we just go back and check

out another they're just another leg of

this tunnel yep yeah which one you know

we could do medicines right yeah is it a

slimy one is it oh I see you time they

try to hurt him

yeah or Matt you try it did he hurt

himself

I would never underestimate the power of

our just around meeting will start range

that's right there's something there but

we didn't find it so it does destroy

stuff there's always 10 feet of stone

boil a stone it's like it felt like rock

right boots what's the size of it yeah

shut up

yeah I just no one else seems like it

did it to be yeah to boots will you come

back if you know cuz it'll lower middle

or right middle slim mostly right all

right I don't know just try to blow up

one of our members should we follow any

fan er I've got Ryan you're going down

this way the meadow want it yeah right

the right one yes to the right okay

let's actually we can we can basically

use this same room I'm just gonna erase

oh yeah be careful oceans the key that

drought skin you have a skincare routine

hmm

though some potions you know some

lotions them yeah it's very small pores

it looks I not a dead end let's guy

let's kick some rocks in here to raise

days for the pool of large day of

glowing big ho stone oh well well well

well you see a long why can't you let

let's make the joke good question

ahem yeah you come into a large round

room and there's a depression in the

middle of it and the depression is very

smooth and that was the floating he's to

see like that and it's like it's it's

sunken about three feet deeper than the

rest and it's somewhat abrupt like it's

not it doesn't it's not that much of a

oven it's a steep incline like like

somebody took the floor we're coming

yeah okay no is there anything in there

how would you tell I was looking you

don't see anything in there it just

seems like normal stone is already

pebbles around pebbles like rocks

[Music]

actually pretty amazing yeah roll the

die in and knock that off with one oh

yeah one small food no no no as far as

you can tell nothing happens middle no

uh I'm gonna I'm gonna walk around the

perimeter okay see what's just kind of

have a look around the perimeter of the

room let's just go down the other

hallway make sure and then come back

there's nothing L we are there from this

vantage point you can't it looks like

the same strange striations in the rock

may there this the only difference is

the

depression in the middle appears to be

relatively smooth is it smooth in the

same way that the wall

no the wall must look like again like

somebody took peanut butter and like

layered it on so it's this weird

rippling to it this just looks like

smooth stone like like like it's been

worn smooth as that kind of you know

like a pebble that's been worn smoother

than a river it has that same kind of

look and feel to it when I tossed the

rock in but it was like kind of like

clatter across the middle and uh just

like a totally normal rock in a totally

normal room od dance in the middle of

that oh all right like you mean like

stand there and yeah okay he's gonna die

all right

can I see your card please just do the

[ __ ] you dance ready

yeah dude [ __ ] you down so Dee the only

dance he knows mm-hmm yeah when I said

dumb that's it nothing happens okay pop

you don't see you just see there's any

like scratching or like directional sort

of scratches on the surface of the

smooth stone not that you can see from

your vantage point well if I was like

right next to it well go ahead and move

yourself no no not really

does it look like there's any space like

if it kind of goes down and then look

like there's any space between the

smooth surface and you know the natural

rock you know like yeah it does seem as

though the closer you get to the edge

the more it becomes the regular

limestone that you're used to

mm-hmm like there is a little bit of a

transition between the smooth oh so it's

not like a hard transition you know

where there's like a lip over the lip is

like a roughly

this angle and then it's moves out like

this and it's just that this part tends

to be rough stone and then it gets

smoother and smoother and smoother the

closer you get in the middle trap like I

don't even know how to I don't know I

think this is all like a big boulder

that falls down and like this any of us

have any rope oh I think all this is is

they're just excavating this place to

find to find something they just make

money and just make a whole ring yeah

it's just we have to do we do the secret

door search in here

well so far with your eyeballs only

boots has gone this bar and slim is oh

I'm gonna go like just kind of pad my

way around for ya okay total 360 adding

the walls yep you know there's probably

a secret door right in the middle there

judge yeah does anybody have any rope or

anything yeah so now you don't want your

secret eyes secret ID door all right

it's stronger slim hold this rope I

don't know and I'm gonna jump into the

middle was being scared like holding the

other end of the rope yep you see boots

leap daringly check and land on the in

the center and yeah is this all a rock

like not even like like no hallo ich

noise and it just like straight up the

ground well I mean not that you notice

from leaping onto it though you're

wearing the moon cat boots though and

that makes it so that it's your your

your step is much lighter than a normal

person's it's not like because member it

reduces your falling distance by some

feet right so okay go ahead and move

your little man's alright yeah keep on

we're s I need to come back here with

stone field

you can stop you you notice you as you

are showing as you're showing exile as

you're showing the demons rise you are

the wall of the of the thing you feel

this like you here yeah you see judge

exploring the wall and then there's this

shaking and just as your brain registers

that the but the ground underneath you

is moving this giant oh poor Odie you

didn't even sing bucks left from a burly

yeah we broke through the concrete it's

it's thing it's it's just a it's like a

trapdoor spider yeah that's good yeah we

can move naturally through stuff like

well without destroying it

well in this instance no a purple worm

can't do that okay so it's definitely

going to leave Oh a hole behind it I

said once it retreats with boots his

body cut your way out that was a that

was a minor purple one is a major this

is the real thing this is it Isis

[Music]

I thought you cover the text even though

it is it's a worm very irregularly yeah

you don't track the work I can't

reasonably claim you guys are surprised

by this no he's not really admit things

mouth actually yeah it's definitely

gonna tunnel through

it's gonna it's gonna attack him well

Slim's oh yeah you have the rope still

what is your armor class boots I should

write down over here somebody nice is 17

ever at this giant warm erupts out of

the solid rock tiny boulders and rocks

and sand go spewing around it and you

can see it's little all around it's got

these little like teeth on the outside

of it that do this systolic motion let's

pull it through the earth oh my [ __ ]

god that was beautiful before and I

landed a dab existing yeah maybe

something different it uh no I a bad

from a backflip as if I just like hopped

off of it you can see any square around

it but now it is initiative you guys

have not already ruled so the others

aren't cheating this probably it's I'm

gonna be like middle of the pack but if

you want mine you can move it up so that

poop was one well yeah whatever kids

that are cleaning up the worms and like

delivering the back maybe no I don't

know no because memory said it was poop

with like chunks of chunks in it rock in

it and it's definitely hit I think it's

just like I just don't know if the other

ones are like gathering it up and moving

it back to the middle or something

mm-hmm clean okay what's your Nishat of

12 that's probably gonna be around here

boots what's here to do seven

that makes sense slim 1025 cobber 25.5

yeah leach five the autogas of interest

according to historians judge seven Wow

what was your is boots oh seven seven

boots I definitely has a higher you

think I've D dropped off

it's just that is asleep in oh the girl

a 22 Wow he's been yeah okay I'll see ya

boots if you want to take fine copper

and zinc either let's see let's see you

see this giant this is one of the

coolest minions I have I want to switch

I'm gonna switch judging OD actually I'm

gonna switch their initiative now pesto

enthusiast is over three hundred

thirty-eight pre-orders on the ship on

the shirt really dude we're almost one

through the way they're over on the way

over there yeah yeah do a little

hunter's mark on them and then probably

make that shirt yeah we actually so yeah

those are you evolved we spent a lot of

time finding the right shirt vendor to

make a better exert and include that

included visiting the place where they

make the shirts and seeing the whole

operation

picking the right fabric and everything

so that we would have shirts that we

were really proud of

yeah good shirts too and there's no

there's no tag which I believe was

slightly every fifth order you get a

lava lamp

an inert nerd oh wow that's cool

I thought you meant one of those lights

you used to detect yes can we go back

and hit that 18 is it's our class

congratulations 18 yep it is I can see

it is kind of cutting this exoskeleton

and many attacks simply spark our bounce

off of its shell okay Harvey uh thirteen

damage magic thirteen damage just

pissing it off yeah 24 hits it does for

a CEO sorry what your initiative Muslim

it was 1013 damage I do that twice yeah

okay Oh bigger on this side right before

yeah there's drawers on three sides but

I'll be cool if we just said little well

we're depending on yeah depending on how

well things go in the future we may get

we may Commission mr. Ralph scholar to

make us in the gym

Oh chef Jason who starts by myself or

someone else I think if I stand there I

have ten foot reach yeah absolutely

that would speak a stirring yeah man

gonna classic dungeon-crawling

classic Matt Koval DM encounter design

so classic like artist was like he's

gonna start singing the purple works on

guys like he's gonna start singing the

song oh no that was my thought when we

solve the ref you spit oh yeah

that's coming yeah well like refuse Pitt

means either carrying crawler or Auto

depending on what level you if you speak

the India which I was surprised it took

you that long to sing the song well yeah

yeah I figured as soon as they took

knock on the wall hard enough I guess

yeah I rolled 15 I miss you did miss Sun

correct judge there's a giant purple

worm trying to get between between you

and the exit to so judge is going to

turn towards the purple worm and cast

wall of fire he's going to actually find

me a wall it it's gonna be able afire

but it I guess it has a 20 foot diameter

ring yes so I'm gonna encircle the

purple worm and then on the side of the

purple worm is on the side that yes yes

fire basically completely shut down my

bloke combat oh yeah so you're just

microwave yes yeah so she

so yeah judge uses exile to conjure a

wall of fire so this giant sheet of

flame erupts out of the ground it's

roaring bright fire but it doesn't from

your side it doesn't really generate

that much heat does thank you anonymous

gift her who gifted us 10 subs we

appreciate deeply appreciate it

sometimes yeah so it needs to make

Xterra t save it's probably gonna fail

it because it's Dex is terrible and

actually hang on here before he makes

that save what was that again okay and

then he has to make a safe

they say he has this advantage he has

disadvantage on here the same girl yep

because you are an architect of ruin

which is the spell casting oh right and

so scientists notice yes support you get

the if you ever feel

you have disadvantage on well what's the

DC it's gonna be it's a deck save you

set yeah it's gonna be 16 yeah it didn't

ruin dinner all terribly roll 11 or 12

but it's Dex is crappy because it's a

giant huge monster without good Dex so

it fails okay damage I've got a ton of

spell cards here we never use them in

movements okay I should already I can't

even see the table I mean the yeah the

goal that you should always have the

cameras are like three different angles

you gotta imagine like a the three the

three roots of I can see it through the

phone no I can see it through the phone

that's why we have a third phone it's

just for you

t-prime 3797 is also gifting ten gifted

subs ten more people now have yes

there's probably more gifted subs and

are people watching okay that's a lot of

dice 9 9 + 4 3 + 6 yes 15 7 is 20 28

image 28 damage is got it how much you

do e 28 yes God thank you yeah judge

Hughes at this thing with exile and

slices into it and you can see this

glowing green energy and that erupts

from the wound as the seal of Asmodeus

inflicts its extra time wait what I

didn't but you all can see all right huh

do you have any unconsumed seals so you

did extra damage did the sword do the

damage or does weapon attacks ozone well

fire it was at the wall fire damage yeah

sorry yeah the wall of fire the action I

believe - yep I resent so that's the

wall fire damage and then I thought it

was wall afire and then you attacked it

but that does make sense

and then I'm gonna move move well

actually

I'll say here cuz if I say here do I

give slim advantage or

you are you don't threaten it hey you're

not close enough you know every step

through your all fire you have to stand

in fire well I mean I don't take as much

demons but now it would be pretty cool

just like casually like walk around here

just because like uh if I'm not within

reach of it or or I'm gonna stay within

reach of it cuz I'm sure it has ten foot

reach right you how would you know that

it's tall like if it could strike with

it it's probably probably doesn't seem

inevitable no not at all

so it's like you know sneaking strike as

far as as hedges up definitely this

thing has that much distance these guys

actually visiting okay it's King ah fire

stay up let's go there

yep it'll stay up and basically it lasts

for a minute and it says on here just

come do this once per day right uh the

fire smells of brimstone I guess

literally Hellfire can trip so go ahead

and make a passive with save I'm gonna

roll behind the screen so he can't see

when I rolled you see fifteen I made

sure also it can't keep saving it's got

tired because the mic doesn't pick up

when I say what I huh huh it's true yep

um

Matthew you only want as far as you know

okay so what does missus missus okay you

all the sex facts yep is OD in the fire

wall - yeah it looks like fire he's

immune to fire yeah he's still dancing

now is his thumb he's from hell yeah

he's loving it

okay burning all the poo off was that

yeah yep

the worm goes on trial okay mom let's

see yeah it doesn't like a wall of fire

where's the wall

I'm way out of a good means basically

it's based on this line because it's

inside this line yeah

a circle is the walking around it yeah

ring a fire door 20 feet high

let's see it's toast yeah broil it yeah

lotsa sausages has anybody who who

copper went mm-hmm yeah judge went but

only cast wall of fire king went what

did you do King can't rip you can't

ripped it all right well let's see well

randomize it one two or three four or

five six okay well the seven slim yeah

does an AC 28 in you oh yes just most

Jessie yeah just great i won the worm

out of the giant wall of fire lens this

worm had the good that is now a flaming

worm head and then emerges from the

wildfire and you all watch it as it goes

and it just rolls back and now slim is

gone gone oh well we'll find out I doubt

that maybe what you imagine is about to

happen so 9 + 5 is 14 and another 9 is

point three points of damage you have to

make a saving throw okay

[Music]

yeah I know they're not going to put

slim in the thing because I don't want

the paint job to get ruined by the teeth

of the thing but slim has been swallowed

by the purple worm

the purple worm retreats back behind the

wall of fire a swallow'd creature like

slim is blinded and restrained slim has

total cover against attacks and other

effects outside the worm and slim takes

a whole lot of acid damage at the start

of each of the worms turns ah how the

worm turns if the worm takes 30 damage

or more yeah you can you can honest and

turn from slim I'm slamming see yeah so

I can attack while I'm in here yeah

being being grappled with your be

restrained which means your speed is

zero you cannot attack rolls against you

have advantage your attack girls have

disadvantaged but you can still attack

okay so you're in here you're bound

within its gullet its gullet is it you

can't breathe in here although the

amount of time I would take you

suffocate was is and it's squeezing you

it's it's its stomach muscles the walls

of its esophagus are crying trying to

grind you and it's acids if boiling in

its stomach is gonna eat through your

Armour and dissolve your flesh my

actually have disadvantage your said

correct okay the would you describe this

part of the worm as its head yes

Hercules yeah

work will swear that [ __ ] is gonna get

slim digestion I can't you can't bat me

that was not my joke I'm not that clever

so that's slim is in here also judge yes

is your AC 28 or less yes

things could attack again after dinner

wow that sucks 9 10 11 12 13 you take 13

points of damage out of the ground next

to you

erupts a barbed stinger at the end of a

purple tail it goes true and you have to

make a constitution set I do is it just

rolling yeah yes so yeah it's either 10

or half the damage whichever is okay

okay no this is no you've gotta run a

butcher yeah make some money I mean

circle the perimeter sure

that was a bomb to open his email you

know he doesn't like yeah sorry yeah

[Music]

[Music]

fine what are you worried about 220 yeah

you Jake is that that's less than

average yeah yeah so they took 39 points

ago okay 39 points are poisoned and uh

what is that

yeah okay so yeah so that's the worm has

swallowed sweat slim twice once wallet

slim small sunny and stung judge mmm or

for 12 d6 damage 39 points you said yes

thank you for the borrowed diets

actually this one yeah okay can you

recognize that what I do actually that

sounds really oh yeah okay that's the

Worple permits now that's always gonna

help you and I also did make another cuz

I'm doing another concentration that's

right concentration that's right Lord

Dirac says that we skipped months oh

yeah I mean retainers are more retainers

are more for you're going on a solo

adventure and you want to bring your

buddies with you your NPC's with you so

it's pretty typical that you start

losing track of your second group your

second fire damage from attacking slim

through the wall does yeah I don't know

how fire works that's up the judge is

that he's said he's you know let me do

the Constitution you did something like

the damage was on tected from outside

effects the purple worm when the purple

one reaches through the firewall fire

does damage I don't know you said

something like this is the damaged part

in this isn't or having it inside like

it's it's but when you go through the

wall I don't know how it works

I said that's a judge question anyway I

just

it says oh yeah I think it's yeah it

does vibe D fire damage to each creature

that ends its turn within 10 feet of the

burning side or inside the wall a

creature takes the same damage when it

enters the wall for the first time on a

turn or as its turn there but it seems

like you just swallowed it real yeah

yeah I don't think it counts as it's a

good question but yeah but I don't think

like reaching through it technically

counts as moving through it or at least

that's I'm gonna rule because I want my

woman to live well but that being said

it is the end of the world's turn and

that me or and that means it takes the

damage right the 5b8 well it doesn't

because on its turn it stung me and it

did 39 damage and I only rolled a 12

qualifier Goes Down Goes Down but I'm

pretty damn sure with it didn't you do

that [ __ ] yeah a lot of damage thinks I

was cool Oh [ __ ] wall fire and it was

completely the fact there was a 50%

chance it was gonna stab you or boots so

I miss the days when we didn't know

about concentration

everybody spells up always yeah even the

bad guys slim has to do 30 damage to it

himself in order for it to congressman

mmm

technically no no I mean there's no way

that you that Phil would know this or

indeed slim but it's cumulative in a

single turn hmm so yeah so yeah a slim

slim nice wouldn't be one attack I think

of two people but you get a turn in this

Emile's gets a turn and so if there was

someone else in there with you and they

held their action till you return you

both act the same time and maybe but

otherwise yeah so you have to do 30

points damage to this thing or some

number of attacks and then there's a

chance you can get out like you have to

save

okay it's a deck save for a hellish

rebuke he's got a seal on him still so

that's gonna be disadvantage on your

deck save cool and so a judge is gonna

do is seven plus five eight fifteen

twenty damaged who is pretty good yeah

this thing stings judge and Joe just

instinctively calls upon the power of

Asmodeus and rebukes the bad work pretty

effective and are we gonna do

but cistern did we do that already I can

do that cistern real quick she's gonna

catch it's also your turn slim and yes

she's gonna do I did was thinking cloud

earlier teaching Congress it works on it

it's gonna be basically like

incapacitated exact really romance Lima

that's amazing journey for slim so

seeking cloud 20 foot radius sphere of

yellow nauseating gas centered on a

point within a range the cloud spreads

around corners in the areas heavily

obscured file lingers in the air for the

duration which its concentration up to a

minute each creature that is completely

within the cloud at the start of its

turn must make a constitution saving

through against poison on a failed save

the creature spends its action that

turned retching and reeling creatures

that don't need three there are immune

to poison on earth I succeed on the

saving through a wind can disperse it so

her save is the DC 14 so it's a

constitution state so what's the area

fact of the stinking luck this is

20-foot radius 20-foot radius so sphere

it's basically that circle so pic so

heat if you if you've been right here

uh-huh right or you could you pick up

you pick an intersection uh-huh and then

you count four score squares out and

then draw a circle that wide so it's big

area huh yep it'll be this alright how

tall is the ceiling twenty point five

feet tall depending on how tall is the

worm well you can't so in here it's

about fifteen feet tall so I'm gonna

cast it above

so that way like even though it will

spread out and be a sphere I just wanted

to capture like the top of the worms

like it'll definitely get the worm it's

just gonna get a whole bunch of the rest

of the room and maybe some of your

friends maybe you I can't cross the high

enough where it will get the worm but

will be too short for it to as far as I

know the non-euclidean nature of this

universe does not work there's no type I

get I thought you're in theorem here so

it's just like effectively a cylinder

that's where you're gonna Center it and

then draw a circle that is eight that is

eight and squares across actually and I

have and you were mad I hit one person

with this belloby actually look this

isn't killing anybody

nerd making me fine he's immune to

facility I think you can yeah over here

like if it's over yeah well if we are

retching and vomiting we are not

attacking I know you're pretty healthy

I'm pretty healthy you can put the

center wherever you want yeah it's just

yeah there you go so I'm gonna fight my

way out possibly get out into a stinking

cloud you might get beauty reaches

around so it's like yeah I'm gonna have

to fly you out but you'll be puked out

into a stinking cloud then you get no

that's right in front of them right and

then I think it still gets me do you

know a circle works I thought it was

pret out I think like say if there was a

corner within the twenty then it'll move

around it around actually I think it

will actually go like this

bighead enough sorry it's fine at the

bus yeah so that that area is that okay

so only Odie gets it doesn't matter

nothing what's a smart lets knows what

she's doing

sorry guys we're okay well in that case

go ahead and make your saving through

Constitution saving throw against poison

really fight this thing should get a

bonus to it saving throw against poison

conserving speech so what do you run 17

ah 17 it's a con save he said yeah 23

very healthy is it sticker maximally

healthy what's the duration on it it's

inhuman okay so maybe next Roenick still

so is that we finally done with butts

yes all right slim rocket come on swim

[Music]

18 18 is its hourglass I believe right

18 is what you need to hit just in case

I'm going to do a distracting strike on

this thing so the next person who

attacks it that's that isn't let's go

back so I guess what advantage on it's

not I pay attention to you folks this

could be robos it think so I need to do

is I need I need another I need another

two legs don't wash down the first two

legs all right so the 17 damage on the

first attack misses [ __ ] I gotta get out

of here so I'm gonna do my action surge

yeah well okay I can yeah absolutely you

can

I'm just thinking like how many attacks

do you get from that two more two more

well I mean if you do another 17 damage

that's pover 30 yeah right but I I just

used both my attacks right yeah yeah

yeah yeah

one thing for them is I'm gonna use a

precision strike you'd be cool somebody

recommended that so that means I got y21

ac21 it's a we go slim you do 13 more

damage 23 damn ya guys if the worm takes

30 damage or more in a single turn or

creature inside it of the worm must

succeed on a DC 21 saving throw at the

end of that Turner agitate all swallowed

creatures still saving though so I got

ya well I mean he can do it again next

ring you guys hear this like a bunch of

a bunch of purple warm bile sign across

the floor and slim covered in bile

slides out and is no is prone within any

space within 10 feet of the worm I get

to choose then slim regurgitate so tiny

whoa look is happening down here

trippy very David Lynch ring well yet

yeah man 30 getting weeds mmm

that was his sling to turn its boots

[Music]

okay you're a sausage you should call me

as the same boots was like oh I should

retreat so I am I don't suppose I can

try and use this uh triple shot crossbow

give it a shot it's got a crazy

mechanism and you're not trained in how

to use it gotcha okay I'm just gonna I'm

just gonna run up and stab this guy okay

between the plates who I have advantaged

because of yes yeah you think I think

that's why well you would have Vinney

ways it was distracting strength that's

right

oh that's really yeah it's very yeah

it's just well something in that person

climbing out that's it

there's a 28 yeah yes cool

so that is don't forget you have a plus

one sort correct it's a short sword

though so that is 11 damage on first hit

[Music]

that's a 24 snip the second time I'm

going to use or in supposed to do my

defensive flourish on this one so I

added a BD 8 I should have at the 8

don't we will have this just to know you

get it for the weapon Smith

to right Rago see landed on to anyway I

wasn't supposed to be rolling it was

she's supposed to go to to God uh so

that is uh twelve damage a so goes up to

nineteen nice

yeah you see boots slides his

short-sword in between the plates a

couple times and it's thin pink blood

comes spilling out that was boots it's

OD if it's actually it's OD and leach

I'll just move him out there wherever it

was horrible cloud I don't think the

cloud affects them anyway I'm gonna fit

around the cooler and I think I've got a

coming around maybe behind ition

immunities firing yeah you can't be

poisoned or fired it

well let's blast this [ __ ] get him out

like what do I plus eight okay oh oh so

13 plus 8 is 21 good and Oh 20 plus 8

that's a creek yeah

crits automatically okeydoke so let's go

with this one first because that's just

a straight damage oh that would be a

knowing good plus 3 so that it's 12 12

well with that one and in the crypt I

don't double you didn't read Axew dice

yeah sorry ty 3 and 10 13 plus 3 is 60

16 yeah I want secret yeah I actually I

I remember yeah I think I don't yeah go

ahead yeah right I know in earlier

editions of the game a purple sword

could not decapitate perform because it

didn't have had well it doesn't say that

all right well cry will burn that reason

why you think copper big gun lots of OD

has tenure in check who cannot be fired

it cannot be League is immune to fire 14

I missed she is a tenured

poison em fine yeah great that's what it

was just reading he's hauled and up I'm

gonna get more minis I got a lot of

really cope might me

you go how'd rule for them yeah but most

of them are crap I don't know if you've

ever looked at him but like I have a

whole but most of them are just meetings

I collected over the last 30 years

and I was like all by somewhere else and

so there I've got a whole bunch of like

not great painted elves for no good

reason I wrote 21 for 15 damage 1516 -

yeah damage and a chemical attack nice

that makes any difference

hmm I don't know if the magic is that

it's judge stop judge and judge in butts

all right so um I guess you're just

gonna step down into it so he can take a

swing at the you step into the pit

waving alright so it does cool so 7.1

damage on the first attack what do you

want to hit 21 feet we definitely hit on

that one so on the second attack I do 9

plus 3 is 12

well so there's 1919 damage on this

second tac-19 is like 20

so it's one less than your soul on the

ground right

you haven't stood up yet uh you are

provide suppose you having fun your

emotions as you can get it is a very

slim chance it might survive till it's

next room so does it have to keep saving

against the the stinking cloud it will

on the sort of its next turn I believe

I'll have a another Constitution save

[Music]

it's gonna be King next by the way Craig

so that's just can they just do normal

attacks it's normal that his assets

pledge oh I see that's it's I do this

everyone understand okay in that case

the up but is gonna go ahead and the

line is that commuter just a little bit

just going through the assets flush and

so it needs to save on a DC 14 dexterity

saving throw or take 26 it fails yeah

they ruled a 14 in this master there's

no big nine damage mm-hmm nine nine okay

that's and now it's me and uh uh looking

very badly wounded very badly wounded

yeah torn up all right I'll go ahead and

[Music]

con save and I believe it Kanzi getting

its very hearty very con so

just gonna oh it's Billy you're hiding

behind Slim's elbow these shirts are

really [ __ ] cool man I'd love to

really nice print - wait this is I

imagine that this is something that's

like easy to get this like Crispian no

that's great I think yes I'm really

happy with the mock-ups yeah we our goal

is to do a shirt every year and so yeah

18 plus 6 hits it does 18 plus anything

else so that's nine damage and then I'm

gonna pre Suzy land exact not 9 damage

yeah and a 16 you did 249 248 damage to

it and a 240 70 points Wow nice didn't

even guys think even even a [ __ ] CR

15 purple worm using all its abilities

and everything you can do was not able

to last around against the chain of a

crop it's it slumps over and this for

that I mean it's it can [ __ ] you up

I mean there's that tail that stinger

attack is 3d6 from the singer and then

12 v6 just from the poison and that's

you get then does an extra if it

swallows you you take 66 damage every

round you're full I'm full yet but ski

clear this stinking cloud out of here

that was extraordinary

I think that was a purple worm would you

clean that because it was purple and all

do you got the hard to stop that thing

alchemy check this is delighted yeah all

right well actually it's Anna's retainer

yep

so an alchemy check is a means of you

wish to harvest the organs of creatures

and it's a it's a it's an Arkana check

it's like a little mini skill challenge

it's an alchemy check and a medicine

check alchemy the alchemy check is to

determine do I know enough lore to

figure out where this thing's organs are

and then the medicine chest is a my

medicine chest the medicine check is am

I good enough surgeon to remove the

organ without damaging it and preserving

I could help it up it's it's whatever is

doing it has to do it yeah you could try

to do it and then you're old and yet

choose you have to choose actually you

can't get its eyes because it doesn't

have any but you could try to harvest

its brain or its heart and if you

harvest its know a brain is a brain

heart or our blood mm-hmm and you can

make arrows of purple worm slaying if

you get blood you can make potions of

purple worm control if you get its brain

break off one of his teeth for a trophy

Chris knife there you go and deception

are both of the skills that Butz has

right so it's plus it's like it says in

strongholds and followers it's like plus

three to everything plus six to the

stuff it's good at it just keeps

mentoring abilities and doesn't really

mention necessarily yes it's under there

should be a section in there for art

skills skill so then she's gonna get a

it's basically like you get plus six and

the stuff you're trained with so as I

still get like sick and she gets three

automatically it gets plus one because

that's her primary ability is int and

plus two for ability Church made with

her primary skills so this is basically

yeah so her base thing is intelligence

so she'd have the normal thing from that

and then she's proficient in our

conversations gonna get the others bonus

there so yeah I think it's just straight

up like it's plus three if you're not if

it's not when you're if it's not listed

there it's plus six if it is I don't

think I have to learning that there's

like okay what's bizarre ruthlessness

she is a 21 year old 15 and is that the

first one yeah purple worm teeth okay

yeah there's there's dozens of one for

each braid like a necklace he's gonna

trophy himself up okay thank you like to

do that I saw that crystal from the well

she's plus six piranha before it's not

using her primary ability is that this

is the or can attract yes what is she

trying to get what were the options she

could get like a farm you can get the I

don't worry what the heart dicing its

blood uh and getting that'll make la

Hawaii to make arrows of slang or I

should I think it's just a weapon of

slowing depending on how you know that's

the heart the heart you can make a

weapon of slang which will do like extra

bonus to hit an extra bonus damage

against purple worms or you can make

arrows of slang which or one use but

they do allow are damage hey thanks

barred rock it was actually awesome from

the thing yeah it doesn't have my balls

but the blood yeah you can do the blood

or the brains or its heart but Brian we

can control her brain would a brain

would allow you brain and brain what is

brain brain would allow you to make a

potion of which has a bias that a potion

of purple warm control if you find the

heart you would get up be able to make a

scroll of protection against purports

match if we found it not a problem yeah

control it

yeah let's get a [ __ ] brain okay we

can borrow ourselves I mean - look you

shot that - I mean how old is leach it's

like in calais a question minors not

miners it uh I mean I guess we can I

guess you'll try for the brain yeah you

control the worms okay all right well

then I meant the medicine Lucy is Wow I

don't think she can make it that's what

he knows would she like know of her like

own limitations basically what is

harvest it's not it's there's no there's

no easy check well

yeah yeah I would just go I would just

roll and give it a shot

I mean shielder 21 what was that that's

for the alchemy check Oh two checks the

first ones the alchemy check which is do

I know where this thing's brain is so

yes let's no buts knows the anatomy of a

purple worm and can find its brain now

the question is is she good enough

surgeons to extract it without damaging

it

what's that check check and ask to be

her you don't know where the brain is

well we should give wisdom are we who

has high wisdom Odie is proficient in

medicine I am Vinci guide no the person

doing it like a you know it's a it's

like she's a surgeon operating and she

has to have both the knowledge and the

dexterity you can't just tell me how to

do it yeah it's like exactly all right

like it's just medicine check which i

think is a plus three you can do it

that's no 15 mm-hmm so but cuts her way

into can I borrow I think I could

probably do this with my tools but your

saw is much more effective for this gun

thing can I borrow your phone so thank

you thank and she starts carving her way

and and she starts cutting like a hole

in the carapace of the purple worm and

she pulls a bunch of fleshy organs out

and dumps them on the ground and then

keeps digging in and eventually she's

got to kind of stick her head in and

here's like she comes and there's like

something I can intestine this big ropey

thing she's pulling out she's like I

think I I thought it was dorsal but now

I but I figured out it's and then she

goes back in and you see like just a

little boot sticking out and she's

completely buried in this thing and

another few seconds comes out she goes

and she goes back in that end and then

comes out after a few seconds with a

couple of handfuls of brain and says I

don't think it worked let's let's cut

this thing open and see if it's eaten

anything of value mmm

gems I'm not gonna be careful at all I'm

just gonna feel you're getting

hack-attack at this thing yeah I know it

doesn't it's it's it's got um it's got a

lot of Earth this being digested but

apart from that no there's nothing that

hasn't eaten any adventures or no no I

tried so yeah there's a dead purple worm

as it left off oh yeah absolutely can we

see down well they're all right now it's

filled with perform mm-hmm like its body

extends down in our okay let's clean it

up or we drag it drag it drag it how's

it - aren't they [ __ ] like super huge

yeah I see you know they a diagram of

how large it is okay it's on the little

know what's on there oh gee and you can

see there's a person on there for scale

and what you saw yeah all you're seeing

is the top 10 what about the hole that

the poison stinger came out of is that

that's really small like it's sorry oh

so it just like just it's like that's

like yeah okay well we ain't dragging

the whole way yes go into it we can keep

going all the way through and then come

back please go ahead see if there's

anything else in there before we leave

and I find nothing wrong no be a beer

empty room now filled with purple room

to try - okay so we'll take 10 minutes I

can Kasper healing it's six targets and

only two of you hurt its to d8 who needs

heals so I mean like anyone who's I can

even want anything you own the other

something

ah doesn't seem worth using a second

level similar someone could take 76 from

me

76 yeah how her are you

I thought you were who's her I'm no huh

also just judging slim or thing done I'm

down 31 us what I'm at 46 well what's

your max 81 anyone well go ahead and do

one da good go ahead do three more da

plus four that's left what was yours 1 D

plus 1 plus 4 5 mr a couple of your d

sixes yeah so what was your plus plus 4

that's a 2 D 8 plus 4 303 what is that

that's healing spirit holy crap are you

right you just did that - yes every time

I love what I get one more dice - yeah

how you doing I can give you some of my

healing light healing spirit should heal

everybody doesn't it it's only a number

people equal to your levels the nerf I

put on it yeah I mean is this 76 plus

any right no just that I've probably

gotten more points than most of you guys

yeah yeah I've got 60 hip points out of

81 okay but that's my healing spirit

persist and people can just keep walking

into it no any judge used up everything

so really yeah okay great

like you I've said I was writing people

or just like it helps yeah because once

you enter you take the healing lights

are on here

300 there I think it's icon yeah I think

it's great Ranger to have the Rangers

and druids only having it almost be like

a combat spell not good after waste all

over what is that from this is anthers I

think so

stop this how many hit points yeah I'm

gonna 48 out of 61 tomorrow 48 no matter

how I stop more have twinsen news okay

all right 3 yeah yeah it's got you say

anything else in here is that yeah do we

have a look around yeah I had a poor

look around hold I'll do an

investigation

I'll do yeah well he wrote good on

where's my rusty nope 9 yeah there's

nothing else out here I just look real

bad as far as you can tell

Oh guys I found this gigantic purple

worm oh wow yeah all right let's go

yeah the other the third exit from the

main room that you guys were in goes

about 30 feet north I think is the

direction and then it splits goes east

and west mmm left and right have to do

what doing I was reviewing two separate

tracks again sure might as well just

maybe there's something here I've never

you send out day Danny never doesn't

look around what's true you can't a

leave it on the other direction while we

go down one way well but here's the

channel 22 we'll just searching for

tracks 20 searching for tracks to see

anything

listen to them or yeah you're you're

excellent Ranger and you do notice

tracks all the way to the left

there were humanoid tracks anyway do you

want to yeah it's a send ID and go look

look through his eyes and said you know

it's leeches and eyes he's invisible

yeah no no if you go scout OD nothing on

me slim

all right the core you could stop me

today the corner goes down about 60 feet

and then opens up into another large

carved out room that's round it's about

three-quarters the size of this one and

it is like this one it is otherwise

featureless there are no doors but there

is a wide hole in the ground with a

metal ladder leading down well well well

there it is you wanna send Odie down

there

daddy guys yeah Danny go ID okay let's

eat but he's going down let's say check

the other one first but I really won

over Red Faction this and just use my

excavation aerial and just like make

holes digging through - yeah that's

great

the yeah these flies down the ladder the

ladder goes about 30 feet down and opens

up into a large natchan other natural

cavern that has a corridor in it running

south another natural doug is the ladder

like just placed there no it looks like

it's bends sounded like it Scott um

somebody has a visit recently how would

you know that there might be like like

debris and dust where they've like

pounded now there is definitely kind of

a little bit of broken limestone at the

bottom of the at the bottom of the hole

Chuck even guy well where do you say is

code off to the South how far can you go

far as I'd like for on the same plane

yeah anywhere on this yes this is kind

of what warlocks familiar is for yeah as

far as I know like all warlocks right

familiars use it for this yeah and he's

like yeah I ran an adventure or my

friends and I had I wanted to be clever

and give him choices and so there was

this big branching dungeon and I will

have to pick one and they didn't I just

sent their impound each they just

literally instead of

what's dumb the other way because I

don't like it seems like that's why we

should go but I also don't want anything

steamed up behind who notice at that or

I should say Oh Dee notices at the

bottom in this room this carved out

natural but not natural this carved out

you regular I should say this carpet

irregular cave well that has a corridor

another natural twisting not natural

carved out mm-hmm there was a pack just

sitting on the ground yeah like an

adventurers back inspector Odie Odie

starts rifling through his nose like a

shovel and there's a bunch of like

digging tools there's some rations

there's a note there's a goodnight well

hell I'll have him look at the note so I

can see what it was he looks at the know

[Laughter]

yeah yeah I mean there is a opens the

note it's written in a very thin spidery

script what I can he read I couldn't I

can see I'm look at his eyes and I can

read anything take two years to write

that thing what's that name maranatha

we weary selita's eyes are still drawn

back it says yeah you're just here I'm

talking these looking it's be weary we

do not know where surveillance looks

like what - baylin's looks like it may

be a door or it may be something

unrecognizable use the first W to defeat

the four balance it will regenerate so

move quickly we have no idea where what

you will find inside but the stone will

probably be in the core and it will take

time to find it use the last W to get

out

I signed Z naught Z said the last W I

don't letter W the capital is it it's a

capital yet I have $2.00 so I use the

first W to defeat for beta it will

regenerate word Oh Warren yeah

yeah it will regenerate so move quickly

okay you have one time what you were

sorry you have no idea what you'll find

inside but the stone will probably be in

the core stone is in a cap to s cause a

capital C and it will take time to find

it will take time to find it and use the

last W to get out we got to find the

core using last W well we got I I'll

tell them Cody's gonna heat this known

it tell him there anything else in the

prac and yeah rummage round a pack a

little bit more I think he said rations

and water skins there's a couple of

there are a couple of flasks of oil I

mean that's what all these pathways are

for is it probably trying to find that

whatever that core is actually that's

probably go check for these paths are X

of it looked like they're excavated by

the purple worm right well I mean like

those striations that we noticed were

those from the worms like spikes what a

reasonable conclusion to say that it's

like a check we can make or something um

cuz a worm moving through wood like that

it would be straight right it would make

nice straight strip yeah the the

striations happen in pairs like there's

there's like a line here and then a line

here and there's like a line over here

and I'll learn him here

I know here and a line over here is a

line over here to line up here I see I

know over here in a line over here nice

thing that's everywhere weird okay never

mind that

all right well do we want to check out

make sure that nothing's gonna follow us

don't we have our whole way if we go

down into the pit yeah where's IDs exert

the pack weed on the backpack on the

floor is there anything else in that

room apart from that corridor going

south no either Koya guy self so I mean

I can bring him back and we can explore

the other one or you can just go down

there and I can what do you want to do

yeah

maybe stubbies going down uh keep him

going see what's down it I mean that I

would like to explore everything on the

top floor before we go all right I was

bothered day I'll bring him back for now

okay he comes back and he's got the note

I take the no off him off you guys eyes

rolled back mm-hmm in common I see yeah

well you know I see all right all right

I read it now that's very script it just

means a very fine handout guys I mean

literally like a spider spider speak

whatever that might be uh all right

Odie's all satisfied there is a yeah

there's a other corridor goes the other

irregular corridor goes to the right and

it ends in a very similar room as the

one you found except there's just no old

doubt okay although it widens out into a

room circular a little bit smaller than

this one and there's just no hold down

I'm just getting to fly around a little

bit it looks around it has the same kind

of appearance as this room says doesn't

seem of any interest seems like it was

it oh it is a true dead end by the hooks

of it does it have the depression no no

all right well let's head down to the

pack I think some you hook it to the

back I take it back now aw cent reward

what do you think stab wound at first

maybe

so now I also not sure that's the case

because it's like use the first this and

use the last this so what did the son of

sudden beat it

use the first WWE - forbidden forbidden

sale yeah like some kind of sword or

something to get it to get to the ward

right and I think the word itself is a

stone but the stern is in some kind of

core and so it's like that's what the

word is but like the way to get in and

get past the forbidden and the way to

get [ __ ] out is right this w thing or

that is it's a good point they have some

of the other words already and they're

using those two what was the thing that

off said what I don't know somebody took

my [ __ ] note I threw it away the

something of you say the forbidden says

failure to use the first W and that's

what separates us fail the emperor must

be okay I wonder if that is be wary cuz

like there's there was a stone that was

in that wall and that wall was like

weird and smooth donar if it's like

owner that's where the thing was but

then the wall has regenerated and that's

why it looks new and smooth regenerate

yeah but why would his pack be all the

way down there maybe you didn't are you

gonna even bought one listen you want to

send your imp further down oh yeah we

can keep going yeah

the sake of scouting please head down to

the can we US will you help us sneak yep

I don't know is that is that a special

spot yeah I just sneak I just leave to

still have to be a bit closer Yeah right

yeah Scooby get a [ __ ] done and so you

guys start sneaking down to the left

corner yeah you get to the edge what's

your role 27 yeah as I mean I have hell

sight so do you hidden some stomps as

loud as he can and it's using doesn't

doing

it doesn't do it I tell you how to make

a bite stop quiet doesn't stop

well the question is like what is that

an ability from the my my homebrew was

that from the Kyocera tears because I

have a no no no III think you're

misinterpreting something but you might

be reading it right I don't want one

said it's the third blood level 6 yeah

nope yep

you forgot right somebody somebody in

chat was like I think it means that you

guys get to use his bonus but you have

to make your own roll that's not as it

explicitly explicitly says they get to

use your stuff result no III ruled right

he was using it correctly okay person

the person was saying I think it works

like this was misinterpreted I think

they were remembering another ability

there's a spell called I think you

mentioned it fast with them that's it I

think that might give everybody a +10

there's a fourth edition ability and I

like stealing stuff before that ish and

so I think that person was imagining but

it was yeah yeah yeah you you you rule

and basically all you folks follow him

and do what he does and as a result you

were very just sprinkles Moss along this

path quite as a reference or something

Moss arrows and thief I don't think I

replayed thee no that's ridiculous why

were you do already mention my book I

know you meant the guy and dad as follow

the pack right okay yeah I climbed down

the stairs you notice that the hole that

the ladder is in is the walls are very

smooth and have this rippling office

like that hanging up but the up in the

other room I wonder if this is the

doorway into it so out of curiosity yes

um

a fourth level I'm able to use stone

shape oh so what I know what that would

look like if somebody else used it oh

yeah it does look sort of like stone

shape it certainly looks more like stone

shape than any kind of natural

process or Swiss sunshine Spellman hello

form a five yeah it's a spell to let you

kind of like you can you can make a

sculpture just by touching the stony

room room it makes don't act like clay

does yeah which makes a lot easier teeth

for a single person I would guess to

like take down this giant hole yeah so

it's a weight the walls in this holes

are the same as that one wall and okay

got grand statue would well how big is

the pack by the way is it like child

sizer is it like adults I know it's it's

an interest pack that's the same as a

pack you guys have I was trying to think

like oh no no no sitting here it's weird

it's abandoned right yeah what's he

doing his tools are there so he's not

like digging somewhere he left them mind

it's like they left it there and then

they went off down the tunnel mm-hm

why would he leave his pack there

westwards not going off we're like any

you like secret doors or anything the

blinking eye officer does not does not

see anything see you guys all so okay so

let's draw this thought I got that sharp

smart come on that's how you know it's

been used how you know has been played

with yeah I did that mind to place in

the ceiling or the letter comes who's

going down a ladder first I'll go I

should probably be in the middle slip

something yeah

yeah herbs can weigh every still trying

to be sneaky pants on

yes don't we have two dozen copper have

to go if we're trying to be sneaky 50

I'll be like in the middle size so Oh

follow what's yours your stealth result

28 oh that's pretty good it's real hard

for a baby knows you follow copper okay

I don't know how big I actually got the

unicorn you know cranking oh I wish you

could just did you get reference

Dungeons & Dragons cartoon yeah I just

like Yolo down there very quiet

oh yeah do we just see we just see you

leave you have that in a whole as an

answer to copper saying how's big cannon

soon the whole way down the Paladins

like a douche thank you you mean the

Cavalier is Erik yeah yeah yeah there's

so recently I saw with that those that

cartoon is it the car commercial I think

that was it yeah there's a carcass

yeah that was out here oh that's right

it was like they were like in this

fantasy world and then they got out of

it into the real life and they're all

happy about it like well that was a

reference to the original dungeon okay

well that's like it yeah I wanna go back

to the fancy rope magic and stuff

you're like it should have been a

crumble yeah Tom now they can buy an

Audi yeah or tune they sponsored by

yeah okay yeah you guys managed to get

done okay okay you guys copy your uh my

name is dr. and dr. butts

Ella middle turns against us the becomes

hostile oh yeah awesome uh I guess I do

Tory look around this room oh my god we

could look around again the pack of the

pack is back yeah we made it it's the

holy as suggestions dark vision is the

holy also smooth the way that the yeah

everything down here is smooth I think

since yes that in class is eight of you

that was definitely well no it's still a

regular now it's still a regular it's

just now everything down here is

what does it does it have that like

swirly swirly texture like okay yep it's

like this whole place has been excavated

by a stone shape presumably ah

interesting

okay so I don't know let's keep going

you want to look for tracks from the bag

down and sendo digging all right what's

uh what's sin Dodi

ahead is like as like a scout yeah well

I will just walk bail at him a baby yeah

yeah well I could like put my hands on

your shoulders and keep you walking oh

yeah thank you boy thank you sir

while you're looking throughout his eyes

like in front of us okie doke yeah so we

say oh he's around what in front of us

cuz I've got I've got a pretty good dog

money yeah one teeny so 120 I'd say yeah

whatever the limit of your Davi actual

vision is and you know it's put them up

there yeah I want 50 rounded out I'm

gonna go leave this pack yeah yeah did

you get that your acento deed oh yeah

he's going down 150 feet in front of us

and we're kind of following behind walk

in man boots is guiding me like this

that way that way League yes so you guys

are marching down the corridor od is

like 150 feet ahead yeah the corridor

irregular smooth veiny smooth down

another like 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 90

feet and then opens up into a different

a different area magic ooh what's in

this air no Dee it's it's no longer

natural or I should say a regular stone

it is very obviously worked stone it's

some kind of large octagonal room made

by people when you say work you mean

like brickwork your stone you can't see

it only yeah sorry I would describe it

ideal what you see there is the walls

the wall it's an octagonal room the

walls and the ceiling are all covered in

like BA relief like it's the stone has

been carved with pieces of art well but

they're so old and they're so worn that

you cannot make out what the figures are

anymore this is it the floor where the

floor it's one of those three di things

the floor is piled like a mosaic and OD

you can see there's little flecks of

paint still on there but not enough to

make out

what kind of art would have been painted

on the floor okay look the room looks

the dead end

it's which is no there is no there is a

door in the west wall standing open okay

there's a door in the north wall like I

could actually draw this yeah because

we're heading there yeah I think I think

we're okay to head down there

I miss this is one of the reasons we

need a new table because I used to like

take up half this table with all my [ __ ]

so let's imagine one square is about 10

feet I guess which is gonna go down

there dude all that fall oh yeah that

was a fairly phenomenal critical blind

girl but she kept going - yeah she

actually saw one last week with this

forest yeah that's full week she's

finding these tops ooh

let's roll a dice well she's not here oh

yeah doctor do 20 stop you tell me to do

it yeah when she's here if you actually

do it mm yeah I'm just gonna roll your

teeth funny but you can't see oh one

another one

let's roll this one out of 401 sounds

actually with actually my loved one

they're all ones we've rolled over for

what are you saying that that area of

the tables cursed not just be routing to

that done oh well this yes for role one

you got rolling Holly I thought okay

another one that's it but to okay let's

see open door

that's the closed door stay hydrated

brought by this blame a drink why are

you drinking water Rose I have some what

is this one cloudy wolf opened or closed

or another that's pathway I've got it

so track them yeah we cross you where he

went

we gotta find that might happen I mean

this is what Odie is telling you about

it and while we all wait until we

probably get close let me get to that we

just go yeah this guy yeah so yeah this

is odd it's very old it's so old that

the stone the art the carved art on the

stone has been worn and it's you can

still see that they're sucking off

figures and stuff like that you can make

out what they are

mm-hmm yep the door in the west wall the

one that's standing open mm-hm

it's carved with runes and there is a

pool of now solidified molten gold on

the floor Oh gold whoo that may have

been one of the that's in front of the

closed door no oh God melted away what's

in that door can you read the rinse tell

me bad language no they're not they're

not there they're not out writing

they're not writing which is not a

language okay

decoration yeah I don't know if I don't

know if slim would know that well if

it's not writing what else could it be

I mean just decoration all right

maybe it's a bit defenses or something

but macaroons like magical rooms and

rooms hey pull up I can Bob an analogy

yeah yeah like this is not writing it's

not decoration yeah yeah it's a warning

though it's just egg nog Rafi right yeah

kind of writing is it what letter is

that like what's but it's it's a symbol

that represents the same symbol can we

do like a dysentry anybody do not

carnage it

no one has done that okay well which

probably do not wanna check because

anybody who knows any kind of magic but

but what are you doing

yeah yeah but says dying - yeah good

make robots thanks King let's adjust the

glass natural 20 24 24 + 6 30 Bernie

say hey I'll tell you I'll bring up

butts like these are ancient memes so

yeah this she says this is a forbiddance

oh this is definitely a forbidden spa

these are symbols they seem like like

there's us there's a spell it's a glyph

of warding yeah this is a very old

version of that same spell much more she

says I would say it's like it's related

to one of the power words probably but

not not she's like stop Howard kill it's

not power it's done our word melt into a

pile and goals oh she's she she's like

she's like it's very old very old much

older than and she starts listing

different languages and she's like no

it's not that

no it's not that are those wrong on the

other door she's she's like this will be

not the

does she know yeah she probably would a

double yeah she's not not grandma an

empire this would be the Shara SETI

Empire this will be the first Empire

these are runes from the age of wonder

she says these are runes from the age of

wonder this is as old as human

civilization gets so I think I want to

end her like the note nerd with is like

no I'm sorry sorry

yeah I want to show what's the note and

ask her this is what was left in that

pack somebody was down here already

does what what do you think the W's

stand back let's make an inside track is

insight intelligence 13 she's like w w

she's like ward we used the ward no you

wouldn't use a ward unless they had

recovered one already if they've broken

in here and they had recovered award

I wouldn't how would they get in without

it so it can't be his own she's like

malted melted gold maybe what Ward was

they used it to cuz there's no the wards

or she's like the words remember with

them you know so the wards or items are

items of power or lore there's sometimes

great lore so it's possible that there

should they're saying use the Lord but

that would make any sense because how

would they get in so that's something

that had multiple whatever W is that

it's something that more than one of

them year old a 13 no she's like it's

probably first word last it's definitely

magic Stefan magic they're definitely

using magic to get through the forbidden

slims [ __ ] ancient yeah he's gonna

roll on that kind of check even though I

make it wait make it wait what you

trying to figure out I want to [ __ ] if

you're trying to figure what bus is

trying to figure out that's inside and

butts has already gotten the maximal

result possible I can't afford or she's

trying to figure out trying to guess

yeah she's just trying to connect the

dots and she's not she's not she's not

wise she's in fact she's how much not

wise but says let's we'll would have

walked into the gaping maw of the living

purple worm if she thought she could

have better

getting his brain well roll inside okay

not great but yeah well I'm gonna roll

to six teams like I said I've been

around a long time yeah and I'm also I

have insight as a skill I'm gonna walk

up to the doorway is that is the melted

gold is it still liquid or is it

something solid gold again is now cooled

in a sauna go

I miss that bitcoins out like molten

gold we're looking that's the doors

hanging open

right it's dark in there

oh so the door is open but there's

symbols on it and that's why we're

printer out the symbols mean yeah okay

so alright so we know that this is a

forbidden s'right oh but it's open

what's this other door yeah does that

one have the same pepper runes on it or

does it that rhymes on it oh so this is

where he came from

yeah so we're in here and there's the

doors that we're looking at that's the

doors got a gold around it we don't know

yeah oh okay there's just a hallway that

goes down that way yeah there is there

is a that the door does have rooms on

yeah but it doesn't have it's closed and

it doesn't have any gold and butts it's

like she's like I think these rooms are

different than those mm-hmm

those are like she's like that is much

more powerful than these and I think I

don't think these are working anymore I

think something I think something in

here was working in stopped yeah so

she's like oh yeah

okay I can't I'm feeling like that

molten gold is like the key to that door

or something oh I imagine it was like

there and then melted and then it's like

what's it like it's like spent you know

the warning said that

the forbidden says will regenerate so he

has moved quickly so that is the case is

gonna regenerate like we might want to

just like hustle to get in there and see

if we can get the ward because it sounds

like whoever may have dropped their pack

is in there now

but the only thing before you get

Thursday yamming I assume once it's back

together again we need something that

whatever that last W is to get back out

again yeah

and they probably have it locally could

have been down there for a long time no

no okay so what are their tracks going

in yeah a little let me check that the

I'm look for tracks going into the

guidance while you do that I'm gonna go

you said let's just open that door I'm

gonna look inside sorry what this is a

very different looking room than the one

you're in this has it looks more like a

box it's got metal walls metal ceiling

metal more the the metal has some kind

of patterning but it's hard to make out

from outside the room I was gonna check

for chapter 23

checking for tracks if it goes if

there's anything it doesn't that gold

room oh yeah definitely

okay yeah large large there's a couple

sets of footprints one of them is like

large humanoid footprints and then a set

of regular humanoid footprints and the

largely improvements are in that way out

out and the regular human footprints are

going are those footprints about Sun

emphasized the ones coming out and giant

about the right size it for us ah yeah

oh okay

alright size 13 Djali

oh you said there was nothing in this

room he said I like awarding inspiration

as a kind of meta way of saying yep you

good for yes correct

because it's actually for playing

obscure parts of your backstory that I

never keep track of what just happened

Sun came out from ya know write larger

those big tracks so we're not I come so

we notice that I've come out from this

oh that's pretty where mine are dead

sure in there but whoever this pack

belongs to is so I'm gonna make the call

let's go try to find this guy first and

we can export the other stuff after we

stop them that's a good thing before us

they're gonna dip and yeah what does

that mean going the small tracks yes how

long does if we do I don't know how long

stealth would last like you have to redo

it every so often what cuz I assume it

doesn't just section II the tomb of the

Sun health the giant diamond breasts

here was a large octagonal room it's the

same shape as the one you guys just left

except it's much larger mm-hmm it's 10

20 30 40 50 65 70 feet I'm not gonna

bother drawing I don't think we're

almost done 10:55 so it's about 70 feet

long by 10 20 30 feet wide it's the

large it looks like that you know and

there is a large dime it's 15 feet tall

diamond diamond is a 15 foot yep well it

looks like it takes a second to

recognize what it is because it's a lot

more as like it it it's doesn't have

that beautiful clear look that you

imagine a diamond ring would have it has

a million more little fractures and

facets in it so it's almost white and

there's a large 12-foot tall humanoid

hole in it it must be the court the

stones inside

you know like outline Ko mass that's

pretty well for short

Meredith wind is apparently likes what

they are watching because we just got

another 50 gifted son oh my god

yeah yeah yeah anyway if you're there

giant diamond so wait does that is the

diamond looking at like a human shaped

doorway like is there it looks as though

yeah it's like well it's in the heart of

this diamond was a lozenge shaped cavity

and everything from the center of that

diamond like forward has like a half and

there's like there's like glittering

diamond shape no idea what you'll find

inside so I think this is they've got to

this bit right but the stone will

probably be in the core and it will take

time to find it I wonder so kind of

portal this chorus so this the gold is

probably gonna regenerate in it right

anyway and he's got Meredith to where

his name is yeah it's got the last W to

get out if they've gone in the diamond

they're in there now they're about to

get they're about to get the core I

don't we gone in the diamond yeah okay

so yeah oh well no no whoever the door

the light in here yeah there's another

one of those doors in here leading to

the west and it is sealed and it is the

rooms are filled with golden words

attracts lead though are those humanoid

tracks that you were following do they

lead into this diamond or daily to that

other door they led into we don't know

it so no one the human of the tiny human

tracks that I'm sorry yeah the medium

sized human hyrax lead right up to the

sealed with a gold door right right up

to it yeah but it's closed

yep see you'll see so a closed end up to

that and they don't go anywhere from

that correct

either they went in and closed um let's

take a look at it okay at the story it's

another invisible

you know another freaky invisible drow

man yeah there wasn't a drop

oh well judge has health sites yeah to

face its advantage on that which is good

that's yeah I like that yeah definitely

looking at make a junior officer or

another yeah kill mas once a has asked

in return for their generosity to any

member of the chain named after and they

chose the name frost which is a great

Wow dangerous I want an npc known after

me like well but what if you what if you

think of a dumb name fryi

process a great name it's good yeah we

will definitely meet junior us give

guidance to people how's that work

that's like when I know coppers looking

for tracks mmm I go up and is it a

cancer oh yeah yeah ray when we first

played used to always use it yeah it

seemed really good no it took it my and

I actually don't know what the rule is

are dying when you can and can't do it

it's my own interpretation that it's

unreasonable to expect King to be able

to cast a spell on you and he doesn't

know what is you're doing exactly so if

you're like you're wondering something

well an insight check you wouldn't help

with that like yeah it's it's like

obvious to him that you're trying to do

some look for tracks okay obviously

looking for track yeah but if it's like

I remember like sure well in this case

it's like I'm using my whole site

because I'm looking around for people

who might be here you could just turn

their king and say could you give me the

blessing of what's the consignee about

car it's a commit soon as Moody's thing

I'm like yeah rolled a 9 no bonus well

you don't see it I mean I'll give myself

the yeah that's pretty funny plus 2 plus

4 15

that's not too bad if there's another

one of those guys hiding anywhere in

here and we opened it up he's just gonna

follow us through well we don't have the

means to open up yeah I'm here voices

well voices well what's that like they

sound like from the coming from a great

distance a conversation through the door

no no from that is how I know they sound

no it sounds like it sounds like it's

coming from inside this room

no they dyed it whispering no they're

having a well it's very far off and kind

of echoey and then it gets louder and

louder and as it gets become as it

becomes more normal volume there are

figures materializing around you and

before you can react there are six

humans who have teleported into the room

with you and and they are as surprised

as you

yeah and they are all human and they are

each outfitted differently you know one

of them is lightly armored with arrows

one of them as heavy armor and a symbol

of RAM astride the world and another one

of them we nerville is like incredibly

fit and wearing you know a loin cloth

and nothing else it has the black

tattoos of jackals across his shoulders

and he is he yeah and he the master of

jackals is the first to react to what's

going on and he is gonna make a command

check against your lieutenant to see

which of them can get their ability off

first

[Music]

yeah correct

excuse me I need to find 120 here we go

Yossi I would come on it's a thing from

Kings marker all right greevey yeah he

critically success exceeded Oh what do I

get like any kind bonus or anything just

it's your level plus your charisma plus

the better of inter wits my level mm-hmm

what's my charisma right plus int or

whiz whichever is better okay so that's

[Music]

8 plus 15 humans and so there was this

moment where where he and your

lieutenant face off against each other

and he understands what's happening

faster than boots does and he barks this

like howling command almost like a hyena

and all of the members of his team all

get a free movement or free action and

we'll pick that up next week

they each have a black iron rod yeah

surprise they were just like having a

conversation mid teleport and then they

like probably pop - maybe that diamond

thanks for watching everybody begin with

the first battle between the chain of

background and black iron pack he's

probably get something yeah that was

pretty cool yes - yeah we've added a new

junior officer junior off with frost

anyway yeah does it look like he has his

own special ability that you can only

use with you if he wins a kamancheh

that's cool so yeah we gave there's a

little there's a commander as well cuz

we always save our commander it on here

oh yeah what the lieutenant's face off

or not well I guess their commanders not

here it depends on it depends on how

they structure their organization and

you guys for sure hey looks like I'm

ready

I mean I guess but my abilities that

tell people to attack things I know

there are all humans they're all humans

what they're okay I asked what the rest

of look like I really pick up

oh there's six of them six just like us

yeah there we go

identical wheel but there's one that's

got a two-handed weapon and heavier

there's one that's got a heavy armor and

I think a mace and a holy symbol mm-hmm

there's the monk looking dude there's

the lightly armored human with a bow

[Music]

mm-hmm for the perfect pretty

composition basically they don't appear

to have up butts okay

none of them they don't appear to have

anything that would correspond to your

notions of okay what did I say I said ma

crane jur spider do they all seem to be

wearing some kind of like okay each have

their beach houses black they're the

black ring and then one of them has a

symbol of new jacks I'm sorry never and

astride the world oh that's like is that

I'm wondering that's like the same ajaxy

right that's able to derive power now

from your accent well I mean it's kind

of like last camp in he dies first

anyway thanks for watching everybody

yeah 11 o'clock I think we did have a

good night yeah it was why I like this

is this is some of my I don't know what

it's like I think I what I've learned is

that a lot of them it's exactly right

the negotiation and the role-playing is

a lot of fun to watch because you see a

lot of character and yet a lot of war

but then people tend to check out when

it comes to fighting in combat which I

understand you're not here you don't get

to roll the dice and stuff like that but

for me this is me super in my element so

yeah I tried it anyway hope you guys had

fun thanks for tuning in everybody

campaign diary next week and I believe

we will have a running the game video

Monday where we talk about how my

attempt to make it as easy as possible

for you to get started playing D&D and

build your own world or at least Oh

area until then toodle-pip be seeing you

laters

[Music]
