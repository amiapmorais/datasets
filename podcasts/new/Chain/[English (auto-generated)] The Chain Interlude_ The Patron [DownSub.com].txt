alright so leech is given a message

you're in the dancing minstrel which is

the bark you folks have basically taken

over mm-hm and judge gives you a message

and says take this to angel at the

sausage shop okay certainly sir maybe it

gets a hem you go across the

neighborhood you guys are in it's called

the purses it's one of the neighborhoods

in Colin cell and you go to the sausage

stop sausage shop which is doing you

know good business and you recognize one

of the folks in the chain and you you

deliver the letter and on the way back

to the dancing minstrel you go through a

square like we're several different

streets intersect and there's a there's

a memorial in the middle of it and it's

like a small park there's a fountain and

there are tables all through it there

are places to eat nearby and there is

there are people playing a game called a

shear which to our eyes would look like

chess and there is an old woman she's

come orange is kind of dark olive skin

and she has milky white eyes and she's

playing chess against this really large

banner man it looks like a Viking dude

and the Viking guy has to kind of

describe the moves to her and he's quite

obviously kind of riled up mm-hmm and

she makes a move and she says sorry

Sonny and he starts to rage he flips the

table over pieces go scattering

everywhere and Sheik hours and he says

darts eight and he is quite obviously

going to hurt this one he's gone he's

flown into some kind of rage and you've

known people from this part of the world

in the chain and they definitely have

this tenancy

Tord bloodlust and that is in his eyes

and he hauls back like he's gonna smack

this woman and she's a tiny little old

lady cowering how big do you say was

he's like six foot eight okay but he's

not wearing a weapon how close am I like

thirty or forty feet okay so I could

dash over it sure okay so that I leach

would dash over towards this guy okay

and that's no way to talk to a woman sir

get out of my face stand down well now

he's turned to you it says you're a part

of this it's a scam between the two of

you I want to call the cops

there's no scam sir I just don't like to

see people treating an elderly lady this

way she grabs you by like I don't know

how tall liters but drower typically

slight yeah he's slimy the best I think

he said he's about six - okay so he's

tall he's a tall thin character this guy

is a little bit taller than you but he's

huge Yeah right and he grabs you by the

front of your shirt and lifts you up

I use anything I can do whatever you

want you haven't even been in a fight

you haven't mm I might warn him

I might warn him I put me down sir don't

realize what I could do to you

he the the cops start coming up they see

that there is a kerfuffled and to watch

officers approach and the woman is

cowering and at this point the vanna man

starts to calm down and he realizes that

people are watching mm-hmm right and he

tries to me puts you down he tries to

make with the cops like there's some

kind of argument happen that like you to

the you two are it's a con job and

obviously there were some stakes they

were playing for some of the people who

play Shearer here play for money

mm-hmm and he's lost and he doesn't want

to pay up and he thinks that you guys

are running some kind of con job and the

two Watchmen that show up just want an

explanation right they want to try to

de-escalate everything and one of them

turns to you and says he's this con job

what do you say there's no con job here

at all I was walking through the square

and I saw this gentleman threaten this

lady here I came over to appease the

situation the Vayner man says that this

woman is she's cheating at chess that

she is why just assume she cheats

because you lost one of the watchman

notices your seal the princess seal and

says oh oh I'm sorry sir I didn't I

didn't recognize you sorry yeah and then

he turns to then the entire tenor of the

conversation changes and the cops now

focus their attention on the bannermen

and say you know yeah our senior officer

here says that and now he's like oh

you're all in it you're all in it and

one of the the one who didn't recognize

you arrests the van oh man yeah right

and he doesn't put up a fight he's

furious but he doesn't want to you know

make things worse for himself

and so that Watchmen leads the bannermen

away in cuffs and he's kind of you know

making like he's gonna do something but

he's he's going with the guy and the

other officer sees that your shirt is

all and he like he wants to straighten

out he's I got a sorry sir it's fine

it's fine

I can care for myself is that well I

just wanna let you know that speaking

speaking for the boys down at the watch

house what with all this talk of war

going on we sleep a lot easier knowing

the chain of Acheron is on our side

you're wise to we are here anyway sorry

to hold you up sir you could be about

your business and ICC salutes you and he

starts to walk away and the old woman is

like bending down to pick up her chess

pieces

oh I'll turn to help her and sort of

help help her she can hear she can't sir

eyes are open but she obviously like she

can hear her and she's like oh thank you

thank you very much

thank you okay you're so kind you're so

kind I don't know what I would have done

I don't know what I would have done and

she's like pudding then she was I can't

tell where the P where that helped me

with the board um there it's just

nowhere though she doesn't know which

way the board is facing okay I mean I

just I mean I'm picking a piece of this

pieces on the floor right so I'm out in

the open you picking them up for I'm on

the board but I understand what a seat

have a seat please have a seat certainly

as I sit down is he sir what kind of

game are you playing here oh it's an old

game it's an old game it's it started in

Komara actually it's an old traditional

game my my mother taught it to me and as

she's looking at you she's she's looking

in your direction but she's like doing

this yeah and she doesn't know what your

ancestry is she can't see you and she is

describing how you know this is an

ancient game and it's played around the

world and suddenly she stops talking and

the milky fluid in her eyes drains and

for a moment you see her natural brown

eyes and she blinks and then her eyes

flash over and become solid sapphire

and she stops and looks around and looks

down at the board fascinating game these

Terrans play very similar to the game

the gods play but their pieces are

infinitely variable

do you play leech you know my name of

course

I've known your name for a long time and

while you

I'm afraid that's against the rules are

you familiar with the game I am notes

I'll play for both of us then they're

very important in situations like this

that we obey the rules so far I've

managed not to break the rules no vulgar

displays of power no outright

instructions but we are allowed to

choose our pieces I must say you're

doing very well I know it was difficult

for you leaving your family living in

exile I'm afraid it's going to get much

worse I chose you all those years ago

because I wanted someone serving me in

the senior command of the chain of Akron

you see I chose you for a purpose for

the same reason I created the Sapphire

sky this purpose it's the most important

thing in the world and as unlikely as it

sounds

it depends in part upon the chain of

Acheron for thousands of years I've

known a moment was coming a battle a

battle between what is and what cannot

be now this is a battle that has been

fought several times and every time our

enemy wins the board is wiped clean and

we have to start over but this time I'm

playing I and some of my friends and we

intend to win my friends have their

pieces I have you until now I have

watched and been pleased

it is very dangerous for me to act in

any way even this conversation takes

enormous effort to conceal but I've been

content to watch from afar everything's

gone according to plan until now

something's gone wrong it's better to

say something unexpected has happened

and that's very unusual for me you see

I've been to a place which you call the

future in a sense I'm there now and just

as your world the world below isn't only

one place it's many cities and nations

and people the future isn't only one

place in every place where this battle

happens there are victories defeat but

in every instance the chain was led

there by a man you call King now there

are many pieces on the board the chain

of Akron is only one led by a king I

thought I knew how to play but now the

judge stands in his place the judge is

powerful but less predictable not my

play style frankly usually I'd sacrifice

a judge to preserve my king but I have

to play the board in front of me make do

with the tools at hand you see I still

intend to win so within the boundaries

of the rule we're going to play a game

I'm going to ask you questions and if

you answer them correctly we keep

playing it has to be you that comes up

with the answers you understand I didn't

so she moves one of her pieces and it

says opening move when did you first

start working closely with the senior

command of the chain of Akron I first

started closely working with them when

they needed a drought to take them to

the underdog

the senior commands very good very good

here let me and she spins the board

around and moves one of your pieces and

then she spins the board back around now

and she was one of her pieces what was

it

the chain was supposed to do down there

we were retrieving a crown from the lord

of madness to return to cause that name

of that lawyer we were treating a crown

very good a very strong opening sheet

turns the board around it moves another

one of your pieces turns the board back

around and moves one of her cases and

says now how exactly did you recover

this item we went to the Isle of madness

we went into the Lord of manses lair he

was playing amazing mind tricks on us

but we were cunning enough to see

through them and actually finally the

crown was retrieved by my MD and we made

quick air escape before the Lord of

madness ascended who did your IMP steal

the crown from it was from that was like

a mummy

but it was an illusion it was an

illusion another man

his name escapes me right now he was the

husband of the deadly that's unfortunate

I can't do everything for you you know

you have to do some of the legwork

yourself I just like that hand there's a

lot of things have happened since then

what maybe been through a lot is my mind

sometimes up but you answer to the best

of your ability what you said was

accurate she turns the board around and

says but you lose one of your pieces

and remove the piece from the board and

she turns it back around and she makes a

move and says now ring well I am

familiar what is it it is a it's a

dungeon where many artifacts are kept

have been kept locked away from getting

into the wrong hands close enough close

enough I think we can agree

who are you talking I'm afraid I ask the

questions if only you knew how to play

what would you describe as its most

prominent features the design the

architecture it's always - it's circular

well that's accurate she says turns the

board around makes a move then turns it

back and makes another move is there

anything else you can think of besides

the circular nature of the design that

is notable about ring well any of its

features that stand out here aside from

the artifacts that we discovered down

there there was there are some rooms

which are fortified different materials

on the walls to stop things escaping

things where holes were once they

suddenly disappear it was hard to find

it's not meant to be found it was well

hidden

how are the pieces within guarded many

different challenges we faced we've

faced what I can only describe as a

floating disease in the air that formed

itself into fighting us and trying to

eat eat out work worm for one of a

better phrase were Marcel worm is

self-interests to our ears into our

mouths that's just one of the things

they were mists vampiric mists a troupe

that formed one of them held me captive

for a number of hours before I was

managed to be freed there are lots of

different I would almost call him traps

there I'm sorry

she says moves one for pieces and says

ambush now the game isn't over let me

ask another way are you free to move

through well yes we can move through the

areas we have opened Oh what about the

other areas she says when she is looking

around as though hoping no one's hearing

I look around as though what about the

other areas leach thank you carefully

are you free to move through ring well

no get through that was OD we have not

opened every avenue that we've

discovered in wing well are there

avenues entering well Wow

doors barriers whatever you might say

very good she says and turns the board

around moves one of your pieces and says

counter ambush it turns the board back

round em these doors you mentioned are

they all alike no don't believe they're

all alike

some have seals on them wards if I

remember correctly these sealed doors

what happens when you try to open one I

attempted to open one and had the

misfortune again to we had to fight a a

guard that once I tried to open it I

didn't have the correct way to do it I

put my hand in and we had to fight our

way through will you fight it what did

you have to fight what was that thing

cold not in your own words leech imagine

fighting a giant clock ah my son my son

how far you have come now we enter the

endgame this is the final move think

carefully

it will win or lose you the game who or

what in your opinion is the greatest

threat to the chain of Acheron right now

there are many threats the greatest

threat right now

[Music]

Ajax and that covers quite a lot

he has many allies could you be more

specific I'm unsure Ajax is of threats

yes he has many allies but he's the

greater threat to the chain she reaches

out to your King puts her finger on it

and tips it over

I'm sorry leach you were doing so well I

realized now I have too much of you too

much of the chain it's just that I had

so much hope for this world

there had strife and pain and injustice

but there's beauty and love

I suppose kept was right but maybe not

maybe not if your real game is yet to

begin if you knew the answer what do you

want from me

goodbye leech and the old Cameron

woman's eyeballs go from sapphire blue

back to her normal Brown and then they

fill back up and become these thick this

thick milky film them and she gasps it's

like pop fur for a moment I I thought

hey forgive me forgive me thank you very

much for helping life I baked some

muffins for for lunch would you like

them please please you can take them

here share them with your friends and

she hands you a basket I'll be delighted

the chain of Acheron will return
