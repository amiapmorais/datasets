I'm grown commander voted off the

forty-third company of foot Ajax as

Ninth Legion and you are coming with me

[Music]

[Music]

hey we lost one Lawrence but he will

return so sir oh we should we do before

we start the battle no let's just get

started

so there's a bunch of orcs that are here

on the deck there are NPC pirate dudes

that we're not gonna I'm not going to

track right this second your retainers

are on that part of the ship on that

upper a smaller deck and there are more

works coming up and ground commander

Vorta cough is inviting you to be guests

of Ajax guests last laugh I mean he told

her he told the captain internship right

yeah yeah the captain's and yeah captain

mass again lady massing I was looking

from you to ground commander protocol

I'll turn the ship around

show them did anything yeah all right

how about it how many are there well

right now there's one two three four or

five but there were more coming out old

I mean I'm guessing just because they're

literally soldiers of Ajax carrying the

emblem on their armor we're probably not

gonna talk our way out of this yeah so

oh there's no need for violence

yeah Jax knows you were not responsible

for the events at the Cathedral besides

you could use men like you smart tough

your commander is dead he paid for his

sins oh and who is this brave person

is it you

I want I want sweet to walk up to this

this commander okay there's a I put I

gave you a laser pointer by the way

although we don't yeah which one you

want to which one of these nonchalant

like you know where do you wanna go here

point user right right in front of his

ass no you guys don't have surprises no

I know I mean I'm not walking up to him

giving him the impression that I'm like

rushing him act casual right just don't

walk up to us like we're gonna have a

conversation of director okay what kind

of [ __ ] arts and crafts um we're not

going anywhere pal uh-huh maybe you guys

should join us could use some good

soldiers Ajax feels the same way you'll

get paid more working for the winning

side

do you think take them out I'm thinking

I'm thinking some or more of them are

coming up yeah what is the what's the

group look like are they all basically

well though are they actually armored

with like weapons and stuff okay okay

yeah they're what you see currently is a

well armored and also uniformed

commander and the others are orcs

wearing their slightly less well armored

but they're also wearing uniforms and

they've got the insignia of Ajax's

troops you would serve the Lord of all

the world well he would be his elite

troops treated well treated like kings I

think I mean I don't think a man a few

words I think he's just gonna [ __ ]

pound this guy in the face yeah walk up

okay we don't work for tyrants hey

that's a good one

it's King as long as his new character

Loras what character did you make

because I don't think anybody here knows

I am a tempest cleric which is the same

thing I was in your head yeah okay cool

so a lightning cleric heavy armor yeah

well I mean if you're gonna stick of

sweet this guy yeah

sixteen Grampa my role copied I know you

didn't I did it rolled really well I

roll to 18s a 14-inch one I was gonna

master I got sixteen if you tell me no

I'm just saying it to fill the silence

citizen it was ground commander for Co

all the members of the the ship all the

ship's crew are all like climbing up

into the rigging and getting onto the

other decks the fo'c'sle and just trying

to get the hell out earlier this that's

why well clear the deck Wow

what I don't have

can I make the assumption that this boat

is made of wood and it's therefore

flammable yes although like like on Fox

fireballs 10:00 to school and they don't

necessarily instantly like all wood on

fire

especially this one's all been treated

if you had some like oil or something

you might be able to alright I had 15 so

copper is at a 15 16 nails would you get

19 thanks King

11 and judge okay so why are you

laughing

further down the 716 copper 15 King

this is gonna be tricky

well it would be probably easier to just

lose the hang cardboard cans but we want

to try it we want to try this for just

one session so the people watching could

see but I don't think if you can see

through the camera I don't think these

things show up on the camera well I

don't know I think that's the only

camera that you can see on a casual

stream because we couldn't get we

couldn't get anything today everything

works Jerry says yeah hey Jerry

everything works yeah because we took a

ridiculous number of cameras and are all

pumping out high-definition MCM yeah

that's accurate

all right uh nail no actually yeah let's

see first people watching this is we're

still very very early in this campaign

people figuring out how their characters

and or the game work so we all have to

be patient and learn together and I cast

mirror image

don't so now there are many nails us yes

how many nails is are there there are

four of me occupying that space pen does

that include you do really you including

real me nice one of one of them is the

real me correct but it is extremely

difficult it is very difficult to tell

them like they're all just saying the

same okay yeah they all by the same yes

they occupy the same space it just makes

it hard to target a specific one gotcha

but obviously if you target for the area

I imagine something you saw what

happened sweet don't you punch this guy

I know that's what you want to do now I

want to just [ __ ] drill this guy so

this guy has not gone yet so I have an

advantage against him that's the

pugilist oh yeah I'm gonna swing

you're inflicting you're inflicting the

Hamaker inflicts disadvantage on

yourself but you have advantage because

your special ability is if I haven't

acted yet exactly

we've got together over the weekend on

Saturday and ran some dangerous

scenarios so we can all learn each

other's abilities so that's twenty

[Music]

fourteen fourteen misses off this guy's

wearing chain alright so first one hits

all right so that's full damage so

that's yeah so what does it look like

when sweet swings a haymaker probably

has a bit of an angle to it okay so I do

not have to roll the damaged eye I use

the maximum die roll instead so that's

eight plus five thirteen damage patter

words thirteen damage for that one hit

yeah okay

and then yeah see I got a couple choices

that I could do for bonus action here I

think I'm going to spend so you smack

him there's this loud crack as Suites

fist connects with the guy whose jaw and

yeah it snaps his neck back and then he

looks back at you and says hey Jax knows

you were not responsible for what

happened at the Cathedral but if you

kill me I'll make your death personal

I mean sweets action it's not la know

I'm going to you I'm going to spend a

great point okay uh just for anyone

who's familiar with the pugilist to

change the Moxie to grid just oh yeah

that sounds better

yeah and I'm gonna do a brace up so

Moxie aka grid is their version of like

key yeah yeah yeah um I'm gonna spend a

good point I'm gonna do brace up so I

can roll my fisticuffs die plus my

pugilist level plus my Constitution gain

that my temporary hit play so nice so I

get twelve I don't know you're the

chronicler right can I have not yet

figured out what the chronicler does

what there are a special ability is so

that's something I'm have to think about

I'm not done that was sweet its copper

and big cat all right I'm gonna shoot

that guy okay

twenty uh twenty hits okay this guy is

dead okay

he is a minion that's my first hit oh

yeah instead of me is I'm all the same

stats of a normal dude except they only

have money apart okay and they do not

take half damage from failed saves

sorcerer cool if they make their save

there they they're fine they failure say

if they take max damage can you contact

okay great there are any of these works

that part minions I will describe to

this being we should probably not kill

this guy because like one of the things

you can do like this is a game mechanic

thing right where it's like you can opt

whenever you do yeah yeah you basically

you just knock them out yeah you can

decide you can decide to do subdued

ambition I think you can even decide to

do it after you've figured out whether

or not

Tom twenty four for its and then lose

your shooting it oh sorry the scary here

okay for

and as my something I have big cat move

no big cat move okay that is copper and

big cat now it is the boss just give him

like good he'll attack you he may end up

using some dual damage to try to but for

now okay Phil watch our boss 15 11 plus

6 is 17 6 and 4 is 10 plus 4 once you

take 44 damage okay keep great axes you

he [ __ ] shits and falls in his where

he does

till next time you got it oh it is king

I got 2 points of damage I'm too damned

okay oh I cast under waves so 15 feet

around me okay is that it's in one

direction right cube emanates from me

yeah a cube emanates from you so here's

a here's you here's the cube okay so you

pick a 3x3 square and one of those

facings that's being funny so then I

should go here I think I think is how it

works well over learning I didn't I

didn't cast under wave in our test stuff

so well I have this right here okay the

way the thunders for sweeps out from you

okay each creature and a 15-foot cube

originating from you yeah must make a

constitution saving thrown on a sail

yeah well I think that's yeah this is

how I interpret it so you pick the three

squares and cube is in front yes

so yeah I thought it would come from me

so what I just put that from me here and

then it would go yeah that works

it's it's there's a 15-foot cube and

you're you stand here and you could put

the keyboard you want but it's not

you're in the middle of it because

that's okay I got it

so then I would want to go it's a 3x3

cube and one edge is it Jason - there's

a pole right now that's live on Twitch

where folks get to vote on how the crew

of the Ross OClO feel back then you guys

are trying to comment here they're going

to come in here they vote well that's so

15 poke you

so let's start with this guy will go

counterclockwise that guy makes it this

dude that guy fails this dude they're

gonna except this guy fails well do

anything else huh well the would have

knocked him back but he's dead it's all

right he is overcome by say if I'm

damaged from being thrown into his buddy

no the same doesn't do half it's not to

minions he said oh you should be able to

just see the pole as an overlay in

twitch in fact if you're on mobile you

should be a little click there should be

in chat at the top there should be a

little like puzzle piece you can click

on and I'll show you the poll and it

doesn't actually say hey okay you voted

it just gives you options and you click

on one it underlines that one and then

you go voted and if you just wait

hitting the exclamation point poll I

don't think it does anything that was

king of yeah okay let's see works for so

this work will charge

and attack he's brain AC 18 that's on

you sorry

that's disadvantage for the first attack

disadvantage for the first dislike

displacement but you were not displaced

he's an Abba - I'm not he's known as oh

you're not know that ok so hello so what

what what so he attacks big cat and

misses cuz big cat is displaced has

displace more a disadvantage or he just

has this event just a doesn't he said

that he hits 9 10 11 12 points in damage

to is I'm a giant displays are because a

whole ton of hit points yeah they're

completely normal works in every way oh

except they have AC 15 film yep 13

points

this guy will attack I'm sure that's

gonna miss ac-12 and he has had Vantage

11 Plus 5 is AC 16 pill

yep you take 15 points an image and then

how many is that 1 2 3 4

this guy shows up he comes up from

aboard and now that he can see he uses

the rest of his movement and then

charges nails nails

ooh 8 8 plus 5 is 13 is does that hit

you no does not because you have your

major armor up I assume and there's just

yes I just matched great yeah AC 13 but

he misses that's annoying he's also like

what what am i but this appears to be

the end of the orcs

it seemed to me any more coming from

below Wow

Oh three plus four is even add it up if

you want to roll back it's actually it's

only the first it's only the first

attack ah if you want to roll back to it

I don't think well that last one they

were don't know last was an attack on

you with that managed Owen and yeah it

was this guy attacking you and he had a

he rolled a three and a four so five six

seven eight another seven or eight

rounds he will you that was the work and

of course

it's a giant ogre looking [ __ ]

[Music]

he does a big limb oh let's see you guys

are all far away so he's just gonna walk

up to and

club go easy on him judges your actions

[Music]

just not to get in range - oh what's the

DC 1616 so he needs to roll like an 18

and he yes this is a ill rigor spell

which bears a striking resemblance to

crown a madness but it's not hygienic oh

yeah so let me read it it says you gives

an enemy with a fiery healer that

infects their mind with infernal

thoughts causing them to see allies as

enemies choose a creature you can see

within range done

they must have stayed on Christmas Eve

me throw be charmed by you for the

duration while under your sway a halo of

fire floods about the targets head the

charm target must use their action

before moving on each of its turns to

make a weapon attack against a creature

other than itself that you mentally

select the target can act normally on

their turn if you choose no creature or

if none are within the range of their

weapons so that's the one I have a

question about like if I don't choose a

target for him does he go back to

attacking enemies when's the last things

that he can choose no target the target

can act connect you on there yeah so if

there's no one from - attack because it

doesn't cause him to move right none of

his allies are within range then he can

just go so I think the ways things if

you don't choose somebody he can do what

he wants even if you do choose somebody

if that person is not in range of his

club then he can just do anyone's so

let's imagine you pick this dude has his

target if this guy acts before him and

if this guy moves ten feet

you can do whatever he wants this is the

term target misused attraction before

moving on each of its turns do doesn't

want you to read it there it just sounds

like he needs to move first

so yeah mister he's gonna use his action

to attack an ally who's who's within

range right and if and if the ally you

have chosen for him is not in range I

think it's with last thing is this is he

can do what he wants

read the lessons again guitar you can

act normally on their turn if you choose

no creature or if then within a range of

the weapons okay right so if you choose

billy ork and bill the orc moves out of

range then he's like oh no he's no he's

not no he can do what he wants because

he can't you cannot follow your command

okay if you can't follow your command he

does what he wants and the thing he was

not gonna do is he's not gonna move to

get into range does that mean that on

this turn I can have him attack somebody

else or do I need a way to point it to

the next so you cast the spell and you

pick an enemy or an ally of yeah you

cast the spell on you pick one of those

ogres allies and then you just wait and

see what happens

turns you must use your action to

maintain control yeah oh wow yeah so

it's like super concentration not only

can you not cast in the spell you've got

a yeah so yeah there's a literally like

a crown of fire but if your halo of fire

appears over I think I can see worth one

of us probably me is causing the canvas

is doing something cause the camera

shake back and forth people watching the

tactical stream we have a tactical

screen by the way so those of you who

are on a PC probably is best way to do

it can follow along in our second stream

em city of to and see what's happening

and actually we have color-coded the

mini bases to match their colors on the

overlay

I don't know how obvious that's gonna be

yeah so there's now a hate burden halo

above this thing's head its eyes kinda

go and who do you choose

who's it started

I hid the minion in front of him and he

looks down at the orchid front okay and

then I'm gonna use my bonus action to

actually let me see if I'm within range

real quick five ten fifteen twenty the

big guy is within 30 feet - I think

they're both oh yeah yeah so I'm gonna

use my bonus action to do what's it

called the thing where I put a seal on

them available introduced right you got

ready you did way better that one like

your second try as opposed to choice and

has an hour who still can't say eldritch

oh my god

he said he says eldritch yeah I can't do

I can't do two things that no I don't

think that's true you just can't cast

your spell's and it's not spelled

correct baleful interdict has a class

ability it's not a spell so you can just

mark off spell baleful interdict is like

a combination of a divine smite and the

way assassins at 4:30 which apparently

super obscure George are you done yes

the way speaking of the devil

yeah so let's see I didn't know how

certain spell works and I'm not gonna

tell you which one I am sure uh-huh yeah

so unfortunately it looks like 30-foot q

5 10 5 10 15 25 or 35 33 I told you I

think I think I just got the 15-foot I

can't hit all you who's that [ __ ] it's

a it's it's a one-armed orc Shannon dude

yeah

one-handed where'd he come from yeah

from the thumbs up below from the deck

block same place and load all these guys

what's that they were in all this

barrels they were in the box cracked

open always orc spring oh my that was a

rough trip huh there was no camera next

to the fact that all the cameras are

working means we can use them like if

you want to grab one this camera so it's

up to you

close your eyes everybody let's see what

are we doing we are trying to figure out

well do you know what um

how about it I know how this about works

Phil do me a favor yes make a wisdom say

okay you wait six all right sweet

in the middle of boxing with this guy

freezes it okay and you are held help

and the way it works is you get to make

a saving throw at the end of each of

your rounds okay at the end of each of

sweets turns sweet can make another

wisdom saving throw on a success sweet

is free liberated from this imprisonment

and that's the orc sham that's done

nails I'm going to expend who knows what

else lurks below in the hold good I'm

gonna spend to sorcery points cast a

fire bolt is a quickened dispel against

Hill this nerd okay which one okay yeah

sure fireball to the can trips is 24 hit

oh yeah definitely

oh this guy is incinerated and turned

into a pile of ash now of interest only

to historians sweet and that was a

quickened meta magic spell it was only a

can trip though it was only a cancer so

you can still cast the spell or another

kindred or another camp look this up I

get over here oh nice oh it's a nice

line

oh I'm look at this guy yeah I'm gonna

say hey oh cool roads just kidding and

then I hit him with the poison spray

which is a con save okay don't say 15

feet he did bummer

roll the dough there's some damage my

ring is concentration do something cool

oh yeah holds concentration right

[Music]

twelves so that is 9 plus 4 is 13

poisoned image 13 poison damage and the

dc4 concentration is 10 or

half the damage whichever is higher

which means he has to beat they tune

what she did he is still concentrating

hey I forget is it's a cone right poison

spray just a 10 foot range Decker

that was nails it's sweet you are held

you are free to make a wisdom say whiz

for wizards 20 you are under bloody your

unhealth copper and big cat no there's a

giant mask but it's yeah 20 look at that

minions are a great way to challenge a

party with a whole bunch of folks holy

sorry I was trying to you were trying to

tell them not to talk what other people

are talking while I was trying to talk

well even more people were talking no

sorry

I find you better about crosstalk yeah

go ahead dog okay and I'm good yeah 14

plus 1024 collapses the ground I will

attack this guy with big cat as my one

attack action I've got a carpenter T

says I've got the MC diem channel on the

big screen the chat on mobile and MC nm2

on the laptops they've got a chat a game

and yeah I am loving the interactive

nature of the stream 8 is 8 misses are

you done so you know a big cat can still

attack right they can act or move I did

his action well that was that was odd

thank you Tom

ground commander vortac off

two minions grant amor de Fora cop sees

his minions dying he's weak fools as an

offer still stand

I like this guy now he's scoring points

with sass nine-nine actually your class

is not the best in the world 9 plus 6 is

15 so it's a d12 plus 10 plus 2 plus 4

is 16 points okay oh I am now the

commander i order you to surrender that

was for tikal if that was his attack is

he gonna move Phil goes down there Phil

do you mind forgive any on them sorry

stupid shamon and we'll move hello

and now it's king king the chronicler of

the chain all right so I'm gonna cast

spirit our deeds yeah so that's gonna be

my current and then now whoever starts

within a 50-foot radius of me needs to

make a what's done how the spirit

guardian sign of wisdom save yeah do you

see 15 wisdom saver they're gonna take

3d eight damage okay well these two guys

are both starting their turn are you

gonna do anything else no wisdom saved

that makes it 18 makes it and 1/8 fails

18 eight that's gotta go yeah what about

and then Amanda oh yeah well it's when

they start sorry oh wait actually

well they begin their turn yeah or when

they enter it correctly answered it

before you guessed it

so let's see this dude 10 ok 14 points

damage he's also dead from from what

happened someone has happened what

happens exactly so when a creature which

in five feet attacks me I can use my

reaction to cause a dexterity saving

throw so be the 15 dexterity saving

throw no gases great axe and Cleaves in

the king and looks at ground Coretta

Ford a clock was running inside a king

look like witness me and then just like

erupts and the orc frost to ass endured

crispy 14 damage right yeah

they don't know what I know which is a

big cat has a shitload points oh but

disadvantage disadvantage because this

is the first the first first attack so

that's just a regular revival okay 18

it's you take 12 big cat takes twelve

plus four points in damage 16 points

language well plus 3 I'm sorry 15 points

15 and then the other guy goes and this

is not the first attack is it the first

attack each person I guess they're okay

thirsted they're going the same just

that just once and at 18 plus isn't

enough 5 plus 3 is 8 8 more to big cat

and they're beating up on your cat no

they're like they're like tag teaming em

like big cats not able to drill two dice

for total huh yes yes yes correct

you were tracking ferocity yes yes no no

it's only 2 nice the HDH did one it's

growl fighter work off those two dice

but these guys only do when I was only 2

20-sided sizzle yours gotta okay so that

is the orcs and now the ogre goes a

little happy man over here will

definitely walk up to you and lab you

you're a likely looking fellow and

unfortunately he does not have managed

so he's not likely hit me entered spirit

Guardians as well correct so something

happens damn right yep 12 that's not

gonna take some dommage close so yes

does definitely saving throws it just on

man yeah it's a wisdom saving throw he

has to be the 15 take 3 da he does not

okay that's terrible on behind the

screen cuz getting up in getting a

perfect I'm starting to

to sit here 14:14 damage what what no

what happened I'm fine

we're all fine down here that was the

ogre it's not judge alright so well the

ogre needs to make a charisma saving oh

I don't think yeah well because he's

it's because of the proximity to the

ground render make a film or hold what

was the thing you were doing to him oh

that's right you were trying to command

it with Halo because the dude that he

was supposed to attack died well you can

yeah you know everything was right

because there was nobody around him

anyway yeah I knew that

yeah I'm smart not like people say new

class but yeah but your class 16 is

pretty good hang on mock him falling

over like you were a boxer judge it's

yours

sure character do what you want don't

SWAT dirty

shamon wasn't expected

my turn I'm just trying to think of what

to do because still going down and the

guy breaking out of it kind of brings

[ __ ] for me I love it when a plan falls

apart because I'm trying to figure out

for the invoke Authority if that's a

action or if it's a bonus or if I just

say it I'm doing it I think it depends

on the thing thority is like the Hillary

ghost version of different channel

demanding instead of channeling divinity

they're invoking the authority of

Asmodeus in judge this case because it

because invoke a [ __ ] invoke

authority is a category of thing and you

as a you know you as actually so choose

the target it's gonna be an action oh is

that it is that what you're trying to do

the other one is I believe also going to

be an action until the end of your next

turn we don't explicitly say as an

action this probably isn't actually yeah

yeah I can fix that

since you're the head of QA yeah that's

true you're also yes that's true yes

laura's I need you to cue a stump and

then fix it and lay out lay it out and

then fix it in my own all right okay so

zero Larkspur says can you get him up

asks the cleric is there anybody else

here who could attend to our commander

role actually does nothing all right

first nikki phil is actually where the

red

I think I think what he was right there

because every corner would you knocked

him down no he's been pushed inside

he shouldn't technically his corpse

should be difficult terrain for this guy

so she is right next to right in the

corner of club Club the order is well

five plus five plus you're just like a

wizard with the 28 five plus you're

proficient on fire okay go ahead and use

cure wounds hey dude you guys seen HP

Beck nice you're awake you're waking

alive George are you done I'm gonna use

bonus action to put I own the big I

don't think you put did you put a seal

on you put a seal on somebody I think it

was the main work you put it on the

commander yeah I'm gonna put it on Club

now okay does that mean there's a seal

on both oh yes okay we need a way to

mark your seals I was planning on using

the magnets well well we've got tons of

them the great the gray magnet should

work

we'll grab them after this so they each

have one seal on just remember that cuz

I'll forget and is that it yeah well

[Music]

you really yeah you realize that means

that club he overhears a free attack on

you what anyway I'm sorry that was

judged now the orc Shaymin goes make up

with said bro I'd rather not but rolling

a free doesn't really matter what your

bosses 14:14 damage yeah he is going to

so as the orc Shaymin weaves a twisting

pattern of colors through the air and a

6x6 cube and they can go anywhere so

it's gonna get all these guys and I

think it affects everybody create your

friends and I need a lot big cat and

judge and King and sweet to all make

wisdom selves 2419 10 so sweet and judge

are charmed you while charmed

you both are incapacitated at the speed

of zero as you see this you're just

hypnotized by this pulsing pattern of

lights that spin and twist and have

magically compelled you to pay attention

to them and that's that that's that

guy's action it's nails

scorch this turn yeah uterine scorcher

it's down here right behind him and just

something big well it's only a 13-2 hit

Oh 13 to hit you missed this guy's got

ring nailing a shield oh are you done

get buried magic match point and quicken

that I do I'm gonna do it I'm not trying

to suggest a course of action I'm just

making sure he knows what his options

are

come on seeing that my first fireball

was a little dud let's try that again

okay fireball damn fire this is fire

bolt isn't fire bolt all right that's it

at 24 that's my greatest my organs this

could break his concentration patterns

what's a concentration that is Oh Joe

eight so that's yeah the work I've Crump

she's running out of juice it's badly

wounded scorched parts of him are on

fire and it's just otherwise exhausted

from trying to dodge you guys in the

spell casting sweet you are hypnotized

and then he break his console he did

break his concentration

oh yeah you're out it's hard to keep you

down so I have to use my movement to

stand up is happier is happy movement

okay I believe this is just a regular

game maker this is not the one we have

to have it gives you disadvantage well I

have advantage

Raheem it anytime I want to do haymakers

it imposes disadvantage yeah right so

but that means that now you just roll

one D point because you got it okay well

let's try get two punches is that

Republican so I got a 19 minutes and 17

17 is big name like you another

favorable 26 damage 26 damage yeah well

he hasn't actually taken that much

damage if this were fourth edition he

would not yet be bloody but it's not

worth it so he is no alright for my

bonus action I am going to use a I don't

need to use a good point for that I'm

gonna dig deep so as a bonus action you

gain resistance to bludgeoning piercing

and slashing damage for one minute

that's all these damages sounds good

except the shape and all this - at the

end of that minute you gain a level

exhaustion

oh oh oh yeah I got it you pay for you

pay for a later yeah that's cool I wish

more things used exhaustion as mechanic

yeah that was sweet it's copper and big

captain

I'm busy perfect scenario for you by the

way it's like I'm just here completely

oh yeah I'm gonna use use ups and

ferocity and you ooh multi attack nice

sweet so I assumed I could attack him

yep so yeah was it

so I'll tack this guy first okay you

guys have attacked enough of these guys

you know their armor class is 13 13

exactly I do and then I'll use the next

multitec on that guy for the next 19

nice yeah yeah yeah it's big it's too

squid tentacles just smacking these guys

around and and each tentacle has always

barbs on it so they hit they grip and

they ran the flesh and armor off you

just yeah swaps a guy in the front

without looking back oh I still get my

yeah way is using oh sorry that's using

is using frosting in a few are the right

you're right you're correct I'm pretty

sure it is yeah you're right here okay

I'm not a hundred percent sure

appreciate that

so that was copper and big cat let me

look at this one you just took out there

with those guys and now it's ground

commander for de Graaf Mako was save I

would not guess I don't what happens to

me take one damage yeah damage well now

he would be bloodied

DNA d12 doesn't have Spanish 14 plus 6

is 20 so you take 5 plus 7 plus 4 is 16

points of damage

[Music]

5 5 more damage and don't you have to

make a concentration show yes so long so

you did 16 points of damage right

correct which is still a lot of 10/10

your DC is still town because it's half

the damage or 10 whichever's is great

it's just a straight it's a contest rule

it's con con I think so okay I still owe

me it's con for now until we have to

look up so that was that was a very

interesting row uh what your crap just

happened that was a ground commander

protocol and now it's king now it's your

turn

he just whacked you where is your

commander now how much so it's gonna be

two d 8 plus 4 so that's not great 9

I'll take the counts we're all learning

that is the orcs are all deaf so that's

this supposed to have gun and now the

ogre would like to push somebody and I

think he's probably gonna punch actually

judge did you do a ton of damage to

didn't do anything - uh it's and he made

his save against your mind control

I guess you're incredibly cheesy mind

control so it's good seven a c-13 yeah

yes he did does something cool happen

well he's done it's judge wait wait wait

prayer because prayer revealing what's

the casting time

[Music]

so you are free to play two plus one is

three

that was King and then the ogre goes and

misses learn your math something I am a

loyal minion of Ajax I serve the rules

and the rules serve Ajax so that was

that in the ogre what now stretch do you

like that spell it is a pretty awesome

did you know that

so I clarified that since the last time

we did this I'm add clarified it doesn't

say like in their current version and I

made a note to Lars to update the PDF

but you have to burn your spell slots to

do it because you're using it now you

don't wait till after you don't know

what's good guy told you you can still

do it well like you have to use this

smells like just to cast this correct

but the thing is like to use the rest of

like it's like three more spell slots we

don't have how many suppose last you

have told like if you had if you hadn't

casting spells today I have four first

level in three you sick

three second level all right so that's

seven slots that you have which if you

save some you'll be able to use low

quality but if you're burned through our

spell slots then yeah it's like a

Palin's divine smite they burn a spell

slot so if they wait until they've used

all their spells before the user device

smite they're gonna be unhappy but it

may mean that the spell needs to be

tweaked that's entirely possible

this is like literally the first time

we've played a c15 against the ogre is

as it turns out well more than enough

he's very large and as it is yes he's

just mostly naked big giant hard to miss

damage consumed the seal that sprit e

good he's still alive but he's unhappy

33 damage ah-ah Club smash nice then you

have to wait to smash

[Music]

you annoy him at last peppering them in

the back so go ahead go ahead

notice me me I don't know how high does

your spell effect spells or is it only

attack rules I think it's only attack

rules yeah they each have an AC so hold

person

since we're all sort of I get the

impression that it's sort of like a oh

that's a that's an eight you are frozen

sure you get to he has to concentrate on

it so damage will break the has a chance

of breaking the concentration but on

your turn

otherwise you do nothing if your turn

you can miss a turn and it is your turn

go seek me see that's all I can do right

exactly let's hear you you burn your

turn that's a nine

[Music]

I'll keep chipping away sweet let's see

here

so did you undo the healing but you did

from a prayer that's will be pro so you

buy they notice me all right I mean hey

punchy punchy so to haymakers voters

rights

commander voters rights

26:26 damage are you not able to create

on those two managers him him doing a

haymaker gives him disadvantage so

because he has advantaged account

counters out but he gets to attack twice

he just has he has Vantage he can say

you see him he has bandage he's for

Dukakis like he's close to death but

he's still standing alright I'm gonna do

I'm gonna do as my bonus action I'm

gonna do the old one to the old one to

spend a great point take two more

two more swipes Adam one miss one hit

okay that is 13 damage 13 damage and

ground commander for tikal falls that's

right

and I wasn't doing that [ __ ] Seville

[ __ ] I crushed that [ __ ] skulls

yeah you kill giant strength and punch

through his backers head that's gonna be

you see that his entire body twitches as

it collapses like someone cutting the

strings from a club that was sweet it's

Capri big cat there is one ochre and one

orc

Shaymin left you're still used to help

find them nails is help okay we are all

sensibly reaching the end of this

comments respect strength 18 hits 9

damage no damage ooh

the Shaymin is also like pulling this

arrow out of its neck oh actually it has

to make saving through all right which

it does 22 that's and 7 damage what part

of the ORAC Shaymin are you aiming at

with what being the best Ranger with

Miss highly precision arrow I let go as

right butt cheek

[Laughter]

so this guy's all right that was a

little bit more myself

hey big guy sounds good real guidance

you get that d4 to that next time if you

see

so is king who was it was it you that it

was it was definitely sweet yeah

so here's my new sweet he does shark

last week 15 baby one

trota your eyes sting like a bee

he's just so upset he's in grief over

the death of all of his friends and now

he's alone and the club goes smashing

into the ship and it's breaks and all

the sailors like oh great

that was the owners judge there was only

left eleven Wow fourteen so another

judge using your your lies you use lies

judge uses his charisma to cajole and

trick result he's not able to defend

himself against judges great so does the

blopps office it best idea I know it was

like you were in side my mind man I know

exactly I mean it's incredible to

convince an enemy to fight for you after

you have been attacking him and Kowalski

hey man if you're all twenty there's no

such thing as a cruelty upon a skill or

failure that's good it happened with

very special lady friend yeah that's two

converted to Griffin the staff office

drop yeah yeah but that was a different

my battle is over

I think Club was just gonna club welcome

to the show everybody

now that the battle is done I want to

take a second to thank

our supporters you the the only sponsor

we have thanks to your twitch

subscriptions and patreon probably

patrons the best way to support us

thanks to your subscriptions we get to

keep doing this stuff long hopefully

once the Kickstarter money runs out and

we actually have our first patron reward

which is we're gonna do our own version

of talking dead well I think we'll try

to do it like once every two weeks see

what people think and it's gonna be

called chain reaction and if you want to

have your patrons can ask questions and

then we'll record the video so if you

hide the hints to the to the patron page

also we've got a wiki know that already

has over 400 entries what so we have a

wiki you can find a link to in the

twitch chat and then if I ever mentioned

any of the places or people that you're

like well what what did he just say then

there's a good chance the wiki has it

and the folks that monitor the wiki are

adding to it all the time which is it's

impressive

pretty cool has impressed people going

through and scrubbing through all of the

posts and tweets and old videos that I

have posted and I would like to thank

our diligent and unsleeping twitch mods

crow n Lord de rock whose name I

recognize and SK 7070 toda Phil I think

that right total film past-due

enthusiastic in eyes from chat and can

trip Cody are the folks helping make our

twitch experience reasonable and fun and

I think that's it for all the

announcements the battle is over

so the Rio and semen start climbing down

from rigging blimey coming your lips

come on really man the ship is underway

you guys are club already has a

Wikipedia the wiki entry nice it just

says club

[Laughter]

thanks to ice borer for point of that

all right let's have some of them so

what was the result of the poll how does

how does the how did the crew of the

Rosco so yellow result react to the fact

the chain just came board and upset the

applecart

[Music]

what tamos lost value can you cast yeah

the last spell I can do me a favor yeah

10 wait wait wait now you need to roll

again wait what has this work

this is several - all right percentile

dices this is the ones and that's the

tens oh well that makes sense so 49 so

let's see this is I mean this is a this

is a wild magic at first you turn into

it then deal of magic okay so every time

during that battle that nails cast a

spell ever every time there's this weird

lot opalescent energy that sparks from

his hand or otherwise joins the effect

of the spell and shimmering colors

appear and swirl around him this is

something you have not seen before

I bet you those people to adventure with

nails before know that every once in a

while there is a strange side effect to

the stuff that he does and it's pretty

unpredictable but now it appears to be

happening every time to cast

oh if I had remembered then we rolled a

lot more so I'm gonna I'm gonna order

some of our our men to start like

stripping the orcs of their valuables

and tossing the bodies overboard

gheh desto looks from captain massing

ham to you he's like what shall we do

with the cargo which is the thing that

you help load on which is all of their

gear well I mean they don't need it

anymore all right

I'm gonna chain sign to sweet ask him

what it is

it's our gear right yeah it's like all

of the it's it's everything a small unit

of soldiers would need to carry its food

and supplies great should we give it to

them as nerve passage we split up

captain massing ham approaches you and

cadets de was with her and she says

let's talk about how much this is going

to cost so who among you does like

talking negotiating this is not asking

out of out of like who's the treasurer -

shoes - shoes is the treasurer okay

because the Treasury the Treasury has a

value from 1 to 6 and depending on what

you guys are trying to do that you can

either if you like negotiate really well

or pay now expensive it is that can

cause the Treasury to go down and

because the guy because of the crew of

the Rosco's yellow as they walk past you

they're like padding on the back and

they're like good fight and they seem to

be pretty happy with the fact that you

have expunged ground commander protocols

troops from they don't appear to like

the guy so would that mean okay so two

shoes is you wanted here well it's up to

you this it's it's

and to choose is the treasure but it's

up to you guys who is the person who's

going to negotiate with the captain for

how much it's going to cost you guys to

get capital yeah we want someone high

charisma and do it I mean it's natural

it's whoever the person is with the

highest charisma

all the senior officers would know that

person is the most well-spoken and the

most has the most force of personality

right there are I think sometimes yeah

you're 18 what skill would you using

well I think in this case I'd be using

persuasion which is only a plus eight

it's good yeah so the captain's like

you've done a lot of damage to our ship

that's that to be paid for that way yeah

you're too [ __ ] up this whole fight

this fire everywhere there's holes in

the club yes but if it wasn't for you

what club have smashed that hole in my

ship no fact if it wasn't for you we'd

be on our way to the infinite desert

well that's not sure I mean trustworthy

our ears anyway they could definitely

matched a hole in something they hadn't

yet they were very well behaved until

you came onboard that skill just go

ahead make a roll yeah Oh sweetie I

can't I rolled in 10 18 plus 3 21

okay so normally depending on how the

crew was what their attitude toward you

guys was

that would have different effects on how

you decrement the die but because the

crew is well disposed to you because

you're only fairly well you guys are

able to buy passage it does cost money

but it costs less than an amount

necessary because there's thousands of

gold in the Treasury we don't keep track

of exactly how much so you don't have to

decrement the value you're able to buy

passage with just a few coins and the

goodwill that you have earned

so if when we go through all the

supplies like deserve like what what's

in what's in there stuff I mean it's

it's any kind of stuff the cod stuff you

would find in like an explorer's pack or

dungeon areas back at 7 times 50 so

nothing of note there's a ton of stuff

it is the gobbler you know a fetish of

groel rules the god of the orcs okay but

apart from that any like alcohol yeah

sure yeah absolutely yeah yeah like yeah

there's there's a there's a crate that

has the commander's seal on it and it

has a budget it's just run yeah but yeah

I'm gonna I'm gonna give it to the I

want to give it to the crew oh okay yeah

good desto the Seas that you're going to

do that and then drink it now I'm just

yeah sure he's like he's like this is

this is an excellent gesture on your

part but allow us to dispense the we

don't know if he's still knee I still

need my men able to climb the rigging so

tonight tonight we will dispense right

well okay so I mean I leave it to him

and Jake give this to your men he turns

to the bed and he says he says commander

what this room suite commander suite

says that tonight the grog is on him and

they all bust open they start pulling

out and they take it below sweet sweet

sweet good don't collapse you on the

shoulder knee is that good man natural

commander

yeah lady nothing happening captain

captain they're both still on deck yes

yeah there are real and soldiers walking

you know all over the ship climbing

so I'm going to kind of settle over to

them and kind of ask them were you

taking the war breed somewhere lady

Massa Kim says yes yeah they pay for

passage no we were on our way to the

infinite desert that's where the like

the Egypt analog is yeah yeah yeah

alright cuz the Pharaoh hasn't hasn't

bowel yeah no yeah no yeah no the war

still rages and these orcs were going to

join they had some business in bed Lorie

I don't know what all right

Jerry's just gotta have a cloth she says

you should you and your men should join

us tonight they'll be my guests

Thanks my guests at the captain's table

absolutely your men she says pointed to

the other junior officers

we'll be eating with my man down Bozak

sounds good and she's you guys all stand

out his officers I assume correct like

that she can tell just by looking at you

five or the ones in charge yeah sure

they were forecasting glowing spells so

copper do you get back on big cat or now

that you're both on the short I've been

laying down on them with this whole time

you've been laying down yeah

I guess I could move them here so you

know big cat suddenly is like you feel

his entire body tense and those of you

who can see big cat his eyes go wide and

he leaps

he suddenly lunges forward 15 feet and

tries to get his paws this front two

paws around hey it's part of our service

you know

I was ready for something crazy to

happen yeah yeah which like

on a rat that you didn't see would be

alarming look it yeah he grabs the rat

and sticks in his mouth he spits the rat

out that's playing with it he tries to

escape so if so the rat is it the ship

is heading north which is the route they

take to capital and Edisto is like and

we have no charts planned but we've done

this many times it should take us no

more than two weeks so if the next two

weeks you are our guests I will show you

to your quarters and there's three rooms

that will each house two of you so

they'll be one one who's gonna get the

wrong room or get to stay with them on

the weekends a big cap and then yeah I

guess some copper big gala stain winner

a new Big Boss can you ask so Lars was

just asking if you guys can use a good

size to you oh and the answer is yes

this is you guys going to be doing

anything for the next two pallets

certainly so you can call this being

called social unrest and burn your head

dissection well as you sail over the

course of the day the sea starts to get

rougher how many of you how many of you

do any of you guys have like a sailor as

a background right oh if I can get a

long rest I would like to rest well

nothing else happens over the rest of

the day except dinner with the captain

which I think that's that's we will so

you haven't yet you know a fight may

break out in the dinner with the captain

I don't no idea what type of dinner

guests you guys are so so no you don't

get a long rest yet but after dinner you

guys will be able

long rest it is 8:30 okay my goal is to

stream for 90 minutes take a break a

stream for 90 minutes so that we don't

knock ourselves out and if we want to we

can we can play later if we want but

that's up to us right so I think we're

gonna take like a 10-minute break okay

and then come back and do dinner with

the captain and see what else happens

okay so we did one battle and a tiny

little bit of role-playing and I think

I'm gonna hit the start break is see

what happens we will see you folks in 10

minutes if that worked then they can see

us I know that I was I I can't speak for

everybody but I'm still like never more

so than last week I am super conscious

of the fact that people are watching so

I do feel I am a little bit

self-conscious we have I think we're

gonna show off now that we've done the

break we had a whole ton a colossal

amount of awesome fan art that people

created and we just wanted to show off

and so everybody picked one or two

pieces that we've been linked to on

Twitter and in the discord and depending

on how organized we are we're pretty

organized but depending on how organized

we are we should get a slideshow from

Jerry yeah this is great

people love the applecart guy I love it

I love this kind of professor Lee I like

this this is the actual contract except

somebody took it applied a bunch of

awesome handwriting fonts you can see

the ink everywhere this is what I wanted

to do but I wasn't good this is great

like this is amazing that is that was

the mini but thank you yeah yeah

yeah you can see the church and the

background is on fire this yeah we

didn't even get linked to this this is

just something somebody drew and we were

scrubbing through references to the

chain also somebody I think was Cary P

was watching and they're one of the

people watching the hack streams they're

like now all the opponents are dead the

chain needs to start eating their

corpses to gain intrinsic so let's see

where did we leave our girls first of

all you guys have several hours between

the end of this battle and dinner with

the captain so if there's anything you

guys want to do while you're on the ship

it is getting slowly but progressively

choppier the Seas so there's going to be

a point probably after dinner where you

guys are gonna have to start making like

Khan saves to see if you can keep your

lunch Update Chronicle based on so this

is when you say an update from sweet you

mean like you want to talk to him yeah I

need to know what went down when at the

assassination attempt okay the commander

is dead okay

fair I was not directly there yeah so

sweet tells him he's already written

though the Chronicles already been

written

yeah so we know we know yeah that's but

but like Lawrence's point is it like I

wrote that but we haven't yet gotten to

the point in this game where she has

been able to be debriefed and so at some

point say yeah at some point you're

gonna have to be briefing his debrief

also he's currently technically still a

junior officer and there's no lieutenant

yeah yeah these are decisions sweets

gonna have to make although not

necessarily now it's up to you yeah well

I mean

it's it's yeah it was a hard choice it

still is a hard choice I'm still not

100% sure it's the right choice but I'm

actually going to make the the analyst

okay so he was the closest to the to the

captain you know he knew the way the

captain worked he also has like

intrinsic sort of like deep knowledge of

the chronical sure which i think will

come in super handy for you know for

somebody for a lieutenant

well you just saved me a little bit of

work because I don't know what the

Crockers ability is so for the time

being he gets to use the lieutenant's

ability you can have more than one time

but you just have to but you have to

choose like each during a long rest

which title you want to get the benefit

of right hey so I still need to figure

it out but now he doesn't have no he

doesn't have no ability he has a

lieutenant right so congratulations

lieutenant oh yeah that's a pity

yeah welcome to their welcome to the

chamber King I hope you survive as long

as long as you're alive or until I find

somebody better let's see yeah so unless

there's anything else you guys want to

do while you're on the boat I mean the

ship has like doctor's facilities it's

got all sort it's basically a small

floating city and the crew are well

disposed to you but otherwise we'll just

advance to the are you gonna how are you

going to be on big cat like are you

gonna ride big cat around the whole day

so so it when you were just like and

you're during your downtime do you ever

get off to copper let me get off big cat

yeah when I need to rummage for food or

something okay so otherwise like live in

the saddle basically it's like a saddle

yeah yeah he's live in the south yeah

well I assume how I get on okay cool Oh

some of the trained guys to help get the

bodies off the ship okay so yeah the you

organized the some of the recruits some

of the rank and file and have like are

they gonna help or is it gonna be their

job are they helping the reopen crew

where we're going to take it out because

we've made a [ __ ] mess this place

let's go that gets that gets more that

gets more goodwill from the crew and so

they're happy to be able go back to

their jobs well while your your guys are

swab the decks going yeah cleaning up

the blood and throwing all the bodies

and so you go through all of the gear

you find a crate of rum and there's just

a bunch of it's really nice I mean Ajax

these are some of his best soldiers Ajax

provides really good gear Forte's people

do you do anything else with the rest of

the gear or do toss it over I mean I

guess it depends on how you I think we

should keep the rations any of the

foodstuffs well I mean if there's

anything anybody in the crew or that

anybody in the chain can use they might

as well take it and then we can die the

rest that's true I mean if there's and

yeah I mean I guess the armor well I

mean keep in mind they also this was the

cargo so it's not like they don't have

room for it we can always take it to

wherever we're going and we can sell it

or we can leave it to them to sell you

know obviously so you guys currently

have one unit of light infantry so if

you guys need to get into battle which

isn't probably not gonna happen on the

ship but when you guys get to capital

you may end up actually in a real battle

like a war where you guys are fighting

an encounter and there's a battle

happening off screen if you guys are

keeping this gear then it's gonna

improve your soul just immediately I

made a note but one unit is there I

think there it's like right now you're

like a d6 yeah d6 unit of medium

infantry that's just the size so you

guys are gonna need to recruit more

folks and increase the size that unit or

different kinds of people my retainers

I'm gonna struct to shoes to secure the

Treasury and then I'm gonna

hook to go down to their kitchen see if

there's anything she can assist with

what is described to shoes to me to

shoes is from switches as your retainer

yeah okay sorry it's not a yes the parts

the cards that don't have this is

context correct yeah yes I told you that

wasn't happening there's not room for it

and you made a [ __ ] skinwalker and

there's literally no room so there's the

pin walkers have a lot of tax what is

two shoes oh yeah yeah she's the one

that's like the she's like the righteous

a really righteous whenever she's uh

where is that where they have different

um she's like a stoic yeah she's from

she's a favorite for from the

Commonwealth yeah she looks a lot like

like a younger younger version of oh

that's okay

so she okay that's super interesting so

you guys are both blah fireballs but

she's probably good and you're evil

she's like do you trust these people

I don't know she doesn't where should I

yeah she asked for four of the

rank-and-file to help her guard the

Treasury yep okay so pick she'll pick

for ya that's unusual it's normally her

in one that person so a guard of her in

four is a lot yeah I'll leave it up to

her to choose who she thinks would be

best for that and then for the cook just

with that in mind from what to ship she

said I'm gonna tell cooked to you know

keep it keep it you're out whenever you

hear people talking never they're eating

okay yeah just kind of like you know if

you hear anything of interest let me

know there probably should be a salute

but I don't know with the head but we'll

think about it we can talk about it

offline kind of salute yeah cookies

cooks like okay no problem

I'll see I'll see if I can help out with

the she was a ship like this there was

got to be

a large chefs contingent that I can go

help out with and and two she says we'll

have half guards on the Treasury

round-the-clock so is this the part

where we're telling our retainers what

to be doing it's up to you yeah you

can't and so there's no obligation

they're gonna they're all gonna find

stuff to do and help out the crew or

just go and they just got neon they just

survived this apocalyptic battle they're

probably gonna want to go find their

quarters right crash for a little while

and then wake up yeah cuz I mean angels

thing is just always keeping an eye out

for trouble you know like keep it in

here out he's sneaky right so yeah okay

no problem that's easy to do angels are

halfway right yeah got it

Kathleen assassin cool yeah so cook is

gonna go mingle

angel is gonna go let's see if anything

interesting is happening to shoes is

gonna grab four of the rancors to guard

the Treasury and find a safe place port

and I assume boots is gonna mingle with

Rio and crew oh yeah because presumably

boots knows them or well is a countryman

of theirs you probably find out if

there's anything to find out otherwise

the ship continues north and the weather

gets worse

yes one thing I never did I I took the

necklace of fire bolts

yes of fireballs yeah and I threw it on

it was early in the morning yeah I knew

I knew I might need it but I never

actually checked out how many beads it

has right so okay is it just a roll I

have not looked up I have not looked up

how necklace of arbol works it is one D

six plus three

yeah when do you suppose to be cut

sounds good pretty good

write that down not bad I like your

character sheet that's cool

I just Photoshop it there enough trooped

it fair enough together nice yeah thanks

yes UI designer

[Laughter]

[Music]

the Sun starts to set and as it gets

toward dusk Edisto comes and collects

even says dinner in the captain's mess

come we eat well here on the Ross

Osceola what is this who is staying with

who by the way oh right we need to

figure so copper and big counter going

to get renew yourselves copper big

character people judge that is a good

question not King

it's probably gonna be sweet it's

probably gonna be sweet judge actually

recruited sweet yes that's why not yet

gone through in read especially because

some people wrote all right so judge and

sweet our room together and King and

nails the rooms are small like it's like

a submarine right - it's everything is

cramped and every time you go below

decks you're always having to like

squeeze past other people who are coming

up or going down I'm gonna go ahead and

keep so every time you light the

cigarette it goes out as soon as we get

to our stateroom it's shot glasses one

apiece

one in memory of red and then one a

toast to your promotion alright this

King drink in this kind of situation I

don't know I don't know what you're

you're a cleric I don't know what you're

really

there could be there could be a holy

forbidden against talk off for all item

Nanak are not after a day like this

clink that's cool so the judge and I

mean sorry nails and king or celebrating

okay so you're crazy for a second time

otherwise it's dinner with the captain

and the rest of the crew I am well I'm

familiar with the spell from olden times

I assume it still works the same way

you're gonna cast the spell you to

commune with your higher power in this

case Asmodeus and you're gonna ask a

question pertaining to the future some

future action some future path that

you're going to take it you're gonna get

an answer that is weal or woe or like

weal and woe

yeah very clear wheel by the way is the

same wheel that's in wealth as in

Commonwealth Commonwealth means the

common health yes wheeler whoa we lower

[ __ ] are you doing this in your cabin

okay a sweet scene has sweet scene we

asked two judges weird like judges well

because it's not something sweet does is

probably not something sweet seen

anybody else do but the sweet is used to

it how sweet reactants react

like I don't know weird voice he's

exhausted make sure okay so he's resting

but you know it's nothing so judges

gabbling in his heathen lingo while

shuffling what is that now is that is

that in any way reflect the deck I'm

surprised because you showed me Anna

collects tarot decks I actually thought

it would be a cool adventure to design a

D&D adventure in which there were many

different decks not just the deck of

many things there were many different

decks and they all had their own agency

and their own goals and there was some

kind of conflict between them and the

players were collecting cards from them

yeah I'm fortunately all right so just

because we're just checking out like

what is just about to happen we're

trying to figure out like is it gonna go

well it poorly is the - right what does

look but when you say is it what's it

dinner yeah okay how's it gonna go

what's the card

today you should show the card - yeah

that's pretty cool I like the aren't on

that see how dare you be steering wheel

does that change learning that does that

change judge's demeanor also means I

probably won't get food poisoning so

what did he say dinner with the captain

it's a very it's uh it's you know one of

the larger rooms personal rooms on the

ship it's still pretty small it's

actually about as big as this table

right and there are six plus five

there are eleven people crammed around

it - Wow yeah so and they it's it's it's

one one one one so you guys are all

sitting amongst in between the crew and

they all get right up next to you guys

these guys first of all they're real ins

and it's big cat their nose you know

where's me right now Gaston explains

that they can give if you have a harness

for a big cat like and keep her harness

for your beast doesn't call it big cat

because there's nothing's name if you

want a harness for your beast we can

keep it secure and well supplied with

that fish I'm sure it looks like a cat

I'm sure it's like spatial that's one of

its favorites okay excellent

so yeah big cat will be safe and

well-fed and growling at me yes a copper

has and the Rio and crew are they have a

very different idea of what like

personal space is and so so there are

they are inmate they have a you know

they are they've worked in the Sun all

day and there are many of them the men

are shirtless that's a mixed crew so

you're saying we're covered in Rio hand

see me

[Laughter]

there's a lot of it in here yes and

they're making sure you guys have there

are times when I'm incredibly

self-conscious that was the captain sits

at the head of the table and the crew

sits in the most view folks and captain

massing I'm she's a big lady she takes

up an entire side of the thing and she

likes to kind of you know like she likes

to take up more room than then given her

large body requires and she just was

watching you folks and how you interact

with the crew and everyday on the crew

men and women of the senior officers are

making sure you guys stop playing food

they're passing stuff around and it's an

incredibly well furnished meal they the

officers eat really good

there's many and the cook comes in and

that Cook has an assistant and they put

out different courses and there's

potatoes and yams as one course and it's

delicious it's it's it smells I mean

what's the food comes in it no longer

smells like sweaty ruins it starts to

smell like delicious food and they have

questions like the captain captain

massing Hammond wants to know from you

she says so the chain like surely the

chain is broken what what is left for

you yeah why capital what is what is

there well you were very insistent when

you came on board gave it no thought at

all what is there in capital what do you

plan on doing hey you know as long as

the as long as the Chronicle survives

and as long as there's you know the

change is never broken Chronicle what is

this that's our book that's our history

no I think you know I mean capital

there's no a Jackson capital there's a

lot of people and we need to build up

our strength so

and what do you plan on doing once

you've built up that strength and we

have a contract that you have to fulfill

that kind of blows your leg would you

have plans for when you get and cadastre

will ask do you have plans I know many

people in capital I mean many of the

many of the people here on the ship were

from capital do you have plans when you

get there what will you do I don't I

don't know if sweet would divulge that

information

well there were ways to answer without

divulging that information yeah except

I'm a lot of politicians I'm trying I

think the quartermaster was a Hegar and

woman was sitting across from the judge

do you have this I think in your art it

has like a symbol of Asmodeus on your

armor is that accurate sure because I

know there's the chain symbol on there

and the artist was like is there a does

she have does he have a holy symbol and

I was like I think so so does there no

you're thinking of the ill rigger art oh

I might be so is there any is there any

do you have like a holy symbol you have

the device of Asmodeus on yours on your

outfit anywhere there'll be a classic

Paladin thing to do yeah I mean except

like you know I understand that people

aren't super keen would that bother

judge well judge will judge care people

weren't keen on it like not really so

but I don't think like getting it

hammered into like a farmer and stuff

like that I think he likes to keep a

little closer to the heart but yeah

definitely before the meal though I

don't know if like if you do prayers

before you eat but Judge does and what

is this also an infernal is this one you

like I see is it highly ritualized as

Eric or is it just like you're saying

grace um I mean it's not a couple hand

motions but it's pretty quick okay yeah

as you are doing this the quartermaster

says we have been by the way she appears

to be like hey Darwin says epic antic

bolts in her eyes but all the crew all

except the captain I'll speak with a

heavy REO an accent she says we have

she's looking at your horns and at your

tail it's just as we and she's pointed

to the other crew the other crew members

she says we have been all over the world

we have seen many things but where where

where are you from

she asks alloy she whispers to the other

people and they don't they don't know

where that is

he says how is this a place would this

business the desert is Assad like what's

the place that quintessence is that

right yeah how low is the capital of the

plain okay at that Agra desto says ah ah

yes I understand yes yeah we also sail

the oh and how did you get here from

there oh gee I joined him and the cat of

the captain is astonished at us two

captains like you of you all this have

you all been to this other world well

then what are you doing here

we have a contract here for us we we we

carry cargo and ferry people back and

forth and we do not concern ourselves

over much of the contracts so d prefer

quintessence over here yeah well we have

I for the campuses I personally have

never been to quintessence no we we try

to ensure Lucic Edisto and says we try

to stay in on these seas whenever

possible mm-hmm I noticed uh one of the

one of the chief carpenter says they all

introduce themselves so you get to know

them and their jobs and these are the

folks that run the ship

the chief carpenter says I noticed that

none of you use your real names yep that

is that only true of the officers or is

that is it a tradition in the chain well

there's really no use for a real name in

the chain mmm she said the lives we

lived before are essentially over now

hmm huh yeah and the chief surgeon

Alonzo is like I like that yes yes but

perhaps we should do the same thing

perhaps we should adopt nameís and they

all start like giving each other

ridiculous the chief surgeon knew you

would be marshmallow I think cuz you're

soft and squishy the captain looks at

suite and says what kind of man joins

the chain this is by the way this is the

only place where she hasn't had all

right right and you see she's got this

like awful haircuts like straight legs

like like straight hair that grows out

from underneath a cat that's almost

never off nice man who's looking for a

new start hmm and has no place to return

to

yeah is that is that true of each of you

yep

Modesto is stabbing at this point there

was other courses of meal have arrived

and Gaston is cutting and stabbing at

fish and he says this seems a very bleak

existence

takes a bite of this food the chain is

our family they all look to each other I

think I understand

no one's stronger than the chain they

look up for me

[Laughter]

fair enough yeah so at this point as the

evening wears on the weather the Seas

are getting progressively more rough

until eventually the ship is like it's

like being on a roller coaster right

there are times are like really really

bad air turbulence where the entire ship

plunges down a wave and you guys can't

see there are no windows in this in this

cabin but feeling yeah your stomach drop

out and at this point you guys are now

you guys are eating and none of you

really up the Sailor background you guys

have been on boats before but not you

know you've never had a career on a boat

it's always been something about doing

door so now you guys are gonna fake

concepts to see how you deal with this

incredibly rich food can you guidance

yourself you are willing creature I sort

of ability I sort of assumed I'd be

curious to know if there was an official

ruling on can you've got the Cass

guidance on yourself let's see why not

actually you can cast lots of spells on

yourself

it says willing creature you're a

willing creature yeah I'm assuming 25 is

good well I mean we'll see the seas are

rough but yeah probably you're fun so

yeah Chad says shadow under the weight

if I move just

yeah I was hoping if I vibrated exactly

the right I wonder if chat has noticed

that I've got eight jacks over one

shoulder so what was the judges result

okay guidance yourself nails 1825 Wow

copper 15 I am stomach yeah you guys are

all fine I got it stomach still iron

stomach yeah you guys are if you guys

yeah so you are all able to and it's

very much impressive the real one group

the fact that you guys are able to not

just keep your food down that but also

like keep your sea legs about you and be

you know everything on the table like it

moves and the correct whenever the ship

goes down or it starts climbing again

things fall back to the side before this

I gather dungeon and all the crew or and

then you guys very quickly learned to

eat Alice and Frank it's this crazy

moveable feast and it's like anything

else we start getting your sea legs on

you in South Asia

they bring out dessert and the cook it

takes two people to carry this huge

pudding in and the captain is at this

point kind of she's kind of full and

she's been talking to folks and she's

like oh yes yes excellent yes we brought

to me out in ate something had to cook

make something special just for you and

it's a big pudding that's got sauce all

over it and when she puts it on the

center of the table you can see that

using chocolate and a little bit of

cream and red looks like jam or jelly or

something like that some kind of fruit

sauce some kind arc red food sauce the

it's the symbol of the chain she was

well it took us a long time

[Laughter]

yeah it took us a long time to find gal

guys she's she's probably the best cook

on the ocean right now

you guys eat well well you know with

that's one of the we have to keep people

happy on when you're on a small ship and

you're all cooped up and one of the

things we can do is get well provisioned

in a place like Blackbaud but make sure

if people eat well and right now the

crew were enjoying an extra ration of

rum thanks to your generosity Cheers

yeah she'll toast to the chain and they

all toast you these guys are who was why

I saw there was some minor some kind of

command decision you made earlier

appointing only four men what happened -

what happened back what happened back

black back in black bottom the captain

was slain the captain before you yeah so

you have you have only been captain for

a matter of hours that's right Oh

interesting how well did you know the

captain pretty well there's a good good

man did Ajax lay him personally we heard

stories that change the subject

oh yeah and good ester was like I don't

don't tell you why I plan to get

waivering up and otherwise to the

captain the captain and of course the

reel and crew don't know the guy God

sleep commander great commander yeah

Gregory's a drink absolutely yeah

whoever that guy was they altering - the

captain a commander uh yeah so there's

anything else unless there's anything

else you guys want to do then this is

gonna be the the dinner is just going to

continue with small talk and

conversation there's anything you guys

want to learn about the crew of the raw

so CLE you're free to ask but even if

you don't you're just going to get to

know these folks so you're even I don't

ask

we should probably also learn about

a lot of them are from capital and we

need leads we need to figure out you

know who are the people know we're

looking for work that kind of stuff so

yeah let's go for it

so yeah well good s2 was talking about

he knew a lot of people are capital well

yes well I mean many of us in fact I

think almost the entire crew are from

capital yeah but you said you had a lot

contacts in capital oh I know yes I know

many people have yes I'm you might say

I'm well connected who are the people

who know out there I mean their names

like I can tell you there are many

factions there many people want me about

the structure of Capitol Hill Hill

debrief you yeah sure he'll talk about

how there was like seven major factions

than all war for control he goes oh

actually an interesting piece of

information the Prince was recently

murdered back from their princess oh the

princely the the the lord of capital

Prince Regent the Prince Regent yes

region so there's no king oh it is a

hereditary title the king the King died

oh I don't know thirteen hundred years

ago and the caelian empire placed the

prince in charge of the city and that is

how it just been ever since but now he

is dead he left no issue oh well I'm

sure somebody does the murderer probably

what do you know about it Oh

so why don't they why don't they name a

new king well you see they there is not

really a provision from the prince dying

and leaving no no no I mean it's Prince

Regent that's just a title right it's

not even kind of that idea before yeah

it's like it's like what's his name um

it's like imagine Denethor except

there's like Denethor was like the 1660

of the region right but there's no era

but what what are they waiting for like

what king are they waiting for

I mean he is effectively like they're

there I mean it would be like having a

king of Rioja except there isn't one is

just countries so capital is like an

infinite city-state and the person that

the title of the person in charge there

is just Prince Richard yeah and if you

go back a long time ago there was a king

of the entire region and that capital is

a city in there

so no one's waiting for anything he was

just the guy in charge

and he was murdered hmm oh yes yes I

think he was poisoned and then another

could myrtles oh no I heard he was dead

yeah so they have a little bit of a

debate about what happened to the prince

and oh there was a great great his body

was produced and covered in wounds and

so no no I heard they never heard they'd

never find the body he tells you the

prisoner so this dude knows I know you

know Prince yeah Prince read you know we

have like foreign region 30 hours of

world-building and we don't know the

name of the prince probably there's a

point where people in Chad has - what's

the name was something I don't know he's

dead I'm not gonna worry about because

it doesn't matter at this point but did

did they have like a last name or

something no I think they're like if you

go back far enough there was one but he

didn't take that family didn't have a

last name because they were like

technically the last name would be

capital because they're the regent of

but it was something that had not been

observed for a long time so yeah

normally he would name an heir and so

this is a time and he was he goes

historically this has and this has

happened before or not in recent memory

and typically the Privy Council simply

appoints a and you reach a new Prince

Regent hmm yes except in this case the

Privy Council does not agree oh I'm sure

there are but I don't know who they're

probably I think the Lord Prospero

Alvaro is it's probably the person most

likely to become in his here book it

says most likely be named Prince Regent

yes I think there'll be much bloodshed

before that happens yeah I was just

gonna say it sounds like this is there's

gonna be a fair amount of skullduggery

before this is yeah yes in fact I think

that uh he says the last time we were in

capital which was long I don't know two

months ago it definitely seemed as

though the city was much attention yes

now all the different factions have

their own guards their own police each

one controls a different section of the

city

so far there's been no open bloodshed

but how long can that last what we could

be war by the time we arrive who know we

already know the factions just from

being around the world well I mean boots

probably does he knows he knows he would

know some of them like so if but boots

is probably a better expert on it so can

you tell us about the yeah he'll debrief

you on that stuff there's like he

describes it's it's just want to get us

a proud oh it's up to you guys like we

can we can we can do it here or I can

deliver you guys like a list but he

describes how there's it's a strange

situation right now I'm not sure how to

describe it because only three years ago

the prince was very unique circumstance

with one of the houses the heads of

houses houses was assassinated and his

wife and there's a long story but now

the principles needed money and he

except he allowed three of the this is

not man talking he allowed three of the

heads of the guilds who are not Nobles

to buy into the nobility because he knew

the money because taxes dried up how

does that work well you see this is the

problem is now the Privy Council has is

no longer United there's no longer all

noblemen who followed the noble

tradition now there are some noblemen on

the Privy Council and there are some of

these newly rich guild masters and they

do not agree the guilds and the noblest

a cannot get along but one of the guilts

now runs the docks so it's very

interesting decision I'd be willing to

bet that somebody's gonna probably need

some hired muscle yeah it's gonna say

this sounds like a like a situation that

could be prom creative team in a handful

of rough-and-tumble types oh and also

there are very few people in the city

who are friends of Ajax this could work

in your favor yes oh yes the whole room

goes RHS

yes

if you were us hmm yes that would be

much less handsome for one thing yes

[Laughter]

oh I cannot know it depends if if I were

you what would I do

well if you were me and I was you would

I be more concerned about winning or

would I be concerned about doing the

right thing because I cannot get a good

sense from you of which is which and I

myself I do not have a well-developed

sense of what oh wow that is a that is a

difficult decision but I would not bet

against the nobles these are the guilds

they have much power and they have much

money and they are growing all the time

but the nobles have been at this game

for a long time and I suspect I suspect

if push comes to shove right now I would

imagine that it probably left the Lord

Prospero Alvaro would be most likely to

what kind of powers are the nobles have

because it seems like the guilds take

control of things like Commerce and

transport and the docks for example but

what is it that the nobles like haven't

feels don't well each of them controls a

different part of the city and each each

of the each of the each guild in each of

these noble houses and do not do not

mistake my meaning when I say there are

seven these are the great houses you

know these guild out the guilds are now

and the other people that it by the way

are all having completely different

conversations they are whatever sent

disinterested in the they've been to

capital a lot of them don't particularly

like it that's why they signed up for

the ship and so to them this is all old

news and not very interesting but Godot

loves talking about it and he describes

how there's you know the seven different

factions each control their own area so

it's almost like seven different cities

right so when you talk about what power

do they have each of them has almost

supreme power within the city they have

their own armies oh yeah they're each a

little city-state and they're each kind

of segregated from the other side

they're not intermingled and then

there's all the princes territories

which are now up for grabs but no one

has yet been the person to kind of reach

out and try to grab the princess

Holdings [ __ ] no one must be the first

one to tip everything over into war

because that looks bad so the houses

don't war with each other

well there is I don't know how you would

put two did say he just say war but

there's not day it just not a hot war

with fighting in the street it's more

about diffusion yeah so yes absolutely

oh yes the great game is always being

played yes spies assassins yes that is I

would say the number one export of

capital is information and you said they

who is it there that doesn't like Ajax

oh I don't imagine any of them like Ajax

very much but I suspect if anyone was

going to work for Ajax it would be the

gilts all they care about is money they

could be bought this but almost I do not

like the noble houses but I think they

do support the traditions of Rio this

Lord well let me ask this

esto yes that's my friend here let me

tell me about this take your time

they said I'm trying I'm trying to ask

me trying to ask Edisto like what he's

what the crews relationship is with like

the guilds of Rioja versus uh I imagine

they have a relationship with the what

controls the docks

yeah the fulcrum yeah they deal with

well you see there's an interesting

situation because traditionally the I'm

kind of dipping back and forth from

Kadesh Barnea

depending how outrageous the exit is but

he describes I like the fulcrum the

fulcrum run the docks and they are

purely secular non-noble Commerce

oriented but because it's the docks

because it's the first all trade comes

in and out through this district all of

the different houses have a presence

here right and it's the kind of most

outrageous part of the city it's the

least lawful part of the city and all

they try to do is stop it from going no

for being like disorganized stop it from

turning the violence in case

that's all the that's all the fulcrums

guards do so almost anything you could

need or buy even if it would be

technically illegal you can get there

the first thing you're going to deal

with he talks about he says that large

box of yours ready yes I assume it is

full of money yes gold gold jammies gems

the men have been talking they have

imagined everything in that box but you

paid us in gold I presume it comes from

the Treasury now they will confiscate

that from you yes you see they do

everything with paper in capital and

they will give you they will hold it for

you and they will give it back to you if

you leave but they do everything with

with paper currency yes yeah a very

strange customer and how reliable is

that system oh I just come with in

capitalist completely reliable

is there a taxation whatever you say

small fee and who controls that I don't

know if it's the I think it might be the

fulcrum I think I'm there that there are

layers there the essential yeah yeah

there the assayer's ago the fulcrum is

the part of an assayer scale in the

middle so you put goods on this and cash

on the other and they take the who it's

a little bit and he talks about how the

first thing that's gonna happen when you

guys gives before you talk to anybody in

in the fulcrum you have to deal with

customs customs and immigration are like

one organization but it's this weird

heart Goodell has a hard time explaining

it it's this dual organization whether

the the board is two people and one of

them is always a member of the fulcrum

now and the other one is mumbling and

they kind of don't agree but that's the

that's the way this office is run so

it's the first thing you guys are gonna

deal with when you get off the boat so

what's the smoothest way for us to get

through this I would say do not rock the

boat says pay your taxes pay your fees

and leave customs immigration behind

they want to inspect your goods but

you're mercenaries I don't imagine if

you have any contraband you have weapons

you have a harmonium

that's a good question it's mostly gonna

be poisons and you'll be able to use

your weapons on the docks

you'll be able to walk around that

entire it's like a little city you're

gonna walk freely with your weapons out

but they would confiscate them before

you left the docks

only nights only nights are allowed to

wear weapons openly in the city he's

tried to give anything else there's like

there are the ghost eras off there is a

list of goods that it includes like wood

from this place it's all trade it's all

a result of treaties they have with

other places what's allowed there's like

a certain kind of fish you're not

allowed to import in the capital he

doesn't think you guys have that fish

there's all sorts of it's not the list

of contraband is all it's not like you

know drugs or guns or anything that

mostly it's mostly guys nothing like

that it's mostly we have we made an

agreement with this country not to

import this so that there so that our

economies wouldn't collapse right and

it's a really long and obscure list of

often nonsense it's big it's big no no

no no Capital is a very no you'll see

many things equally strange I mean

equally unusual

I mean equally a six-legged capital is a

very strange city yeah probably

yes she's talking to me oh we work we

don't we don't work for a genetics we

were we took we took ground catch Esther

remember ground commander order box we

had to take we took his money and we

were gonna take him to the infinite

desert just like we took your money but

we're not working for you that's an

important point from her point of view

[Music]

they came in booked passage and she said

okay sure yeah we'll take it to the into

the desert yeah she didn't ask any

questions

right she was I will tell you this

though I was not I would not have

invited ground commander border-box gage

esto will does inform nails because he

saw you casting spells and stuff that

there's a prohibition against magic

there are ways there are ways around it

it's like we're going to California

there was hot

bill you can't a both speak and they're

gonna have a stock that's longer than

searching there's all sorts of crazy

laws for for her weapons he was he goes

I am because I we do not have a we do

not know but I know there are ways

around that there are licenses you can

get we just have to talk to the right

people there may be somebody on board

who I could talk to them we didn't be

able to find a representative of the

appropriate I don't know if it's a

church or a university or something like

the nobleman's personal armies and

guards and stuff like that are armed all

right yeah well the way the wait what he

is describing is like yeah all the there

is there is like each each house has a

couple of different polices right they

have like the district police and I've

got their private police and they've got

you know kind of small and or mean so

there's all sorts of different there's

lots of weapons it's people up they just

all have basically it's really easy to

come by things like a knighthood it's

really easy to come by the kind of seal

you would need to show somebody so if

you gotta know if you have a spell fight

with somebody or just put guards would

show up and they would demand either

they're gonna arrest you or you need to

show them that you have a license and

license isn't a piece of paper it's

usually a large metal or ceramic seal

you display and you guys I've seen them

everywhere I do not know how they come

by them they're not rare but if you

don't have one interesting your caster

if you do the thing with your fingers

and then make the lightning happen

you'll be in jail well like a registry

you're just given something physical I

don't know you maybe your name may be

written somewhere

hmm my name he was aiming very well huh

sounds like an interesting place yeah

well it was a very interesting it is it

just not it is not it is very crowded

and full of laws in they all yes

boulevards yes delightful yes and I laid

a cigarette with a plume of flame as

well we have no restriction against it

in your wooden ship no yeah well I mean

yeah we trust we trust you're not gonna

burn the ship that you're on to the

ground okay you know I will talk to thee

I will it to your earlier question I'll

talk to them in and see if there is

anyone that we know that might be a good

person to talk to him but he says I

imagine depending on the current stage

of the city when we arrived there

virtually everyone there would hire you

that's good yeah especially especially a

UH actually are you guys famous or not

like I don't think any of these guys

have ever heard you I never heard of us

are just the chain chain probably not

like you guys are you guys are you guys

are famous in a lot of places but these

guys don't go like they live on this

boat all right they only know about the

things that people who come to us o

shah-i mean I would say like the average

citizen probably is not heard of you but

anybody that's like paid attention and

in fact if this comes do you guys spend

a lot more time at this dinner than

we're gonna spend in this conversation

so you guys talk about a lot of stuff so

later on like after if it comes up you

guys and say hey did we ever find out

this from those guys and that dinner and

the answer is probably yes

because even though we didn't talk about

here right guys spent all night talking

to these guys and forgot what we owe the

like he will say at one point anybody

who reads the papers will probably have

heard of you that's actually the phrase

he uses we might say the sheets anybody

who reads the sheets

we'll probably a very nice movie no he's

referring to I don't know do you know

what he's referring to should I roll the

thing well I mean you can you could well

has nails been to Capitol probably not

know this is something that is sort of

capital well it's it's me if you can't

eat you've seen things like this before

where he's using a phrase that everyone

he knows he uses all the time so often

that it doesn't occur to him to explain

it right doesn't occur to him that you

guys might not know what the sheets are

yeah even though you as players might

know yeah if you think about it so I

would imagine probably whenever we get

in like there's got to be somebody that

we can just basically tell like hey the

chains in town right that would spread

that word spread very dark skin dark he

looks like a hazard it looks like

somebody fits course here again talks

with a thick Rio an accent

he's eating these like they already know

who runs the sheets uh he Nate I don't

know what their proper name is but it's

the broad sheet he'll there they

actually it's easy as it is a woman I

don't know that I have ever seen her but

I have seen her her second I have seen

her what is the name what does the name

they use for him and the captain says

editor was yes yes I have seen her

editor yes and he is uh I need makes

this gesture and he says he's a crystal

crystal dragon person thing what whoa

Dragonborn yeah yes and they control the

news they control all the information

they control what people know he's

crystal yeah he's a he's a he's a

gemstone dragon boy and yeah and he's

the editor he's the kind of second kind

of this guild and they have a monopoly

on printing the broadsheets it's like a

technological monopoly says they have

some technique they have developed it

allows them to make many many many

copies of something very quickly very

cheaply the paper disintegrates almost

immediately but the engravers guild

cannot keep up yeah it's and it used to

be really powerful in fact it like like

just a couple years ago it would have

been one of the guilds being able to buy

its way into the nobility but then this

this woman came along and she had this

technique that no one else understands

that allows her mikage ink i could the

paper he doesn't know it was but he

remembers a time when there were no

there was no such thing as there were

not counting Criers and that was over

you could subscribe because man i use

that word you could subscribe to an

engravers guild thing that they were

sending like once a month and that was

the closest you've got to news right and

then suddenly the whole city changed

once the broadsheets came out hmm

these guys say people think is true yeah

I'm sure

and there's almost no competition there

are there is more than one sheet right

he calls them but they're all like

licensed from this one guild you know so

they say they're independent but how

independent can they be if they wanted

to print something to as critical or the

broadsheet guild would they be allowed

to would they be able to continue using

the presses

yeah this is super interesting to me so

yeah like you guys are gonna you guys

are gonna know to pay its update you

know how much you're gonna remember when

you're drinking and eating and having

this conversation who knows but you guys

are gonna learn a lot about capital

because these guys this is a the reason

all these guys have thick reown accents

is because even though they were all

their grandparents or whatever were born

in different places they were all born

and raised in capital right that's where

this crew came from before they messy

one the ship what does anybody else not

drink I drank with nails but not at

dinner okay is there anything else you

guys want to know about capital I mean

good Jeff Stowell loves talking about it

this is hometown well I mean I

definitely want the breakdown of the

Guild's and Noble houses there's a

Google Doc so you'll probably have

access he'll I'll share with you some of

the stuff that we did in the world

building extremes and that'll be

something that you know as a result of

these conversations and you'll be kind

of a local expert in the chain based on

although I guess you guys are all there

so I can share to all of you like this

is what this is what King Edisto talked

about that night and it'll be like I

press it will be just a high a super

high-level overview of what's going on

to see Kadesh know of all of them the

rest of them are happy to have other

conversations about just anything else

including speculation about what having

capital at black bottom and whether or

not they're gonna get in trouble like

like you know they think they're

probably be fine

you know the the these orcs are just

gonna have disappeared all right like

there's probably no one there's probably

no record of them ever coming on the

ship in the first place now they're all

dead so they think they're probably

gonna be fine and stuff like this

happens at sea all the time so they're

not super worried about if they're gonna

get in any kind trouble but that's an a

stuff they're talking about and yeah and

what Ajax was doing it's but it's all

just pure dinnertime and curiosity what

was ajax doing in did he know was he

there for the reason

just there to kill some health lady it

seems super strange but could desto love

talking about capital for some reason

you know as we were leaving we saw the

sparrow crows by some giant sea creature

is that common no and lady massing

happens like comment no have you ever

seen that happen before

I've seen many strange things at sea and

there are monsters in the deep and I've

heard stories but I've never personally

witnessed any kind of like sea monsters

attacking attacking a ship no no I've

never seen I've never witnessed anything

like that before it I don't think any of

us will forget it and several of the

crew new people on the sparrow how I've

been I've been captain well in 10 years

now 10 years since Ajax came to maslow

you when we were going through the work

stuff and getting rid of 85 in any

paperwork or anything like that I mean

their works like I'm sure that ground

commander for takeoff has a lieutenant

and that lieutenant kept a log so you

guys can salvage that log okay do you

does it seem like they overstated their

importance to HX ha who's asking that is

anti asking that is judge asking if so

who's asking

I think it's do you good at reading

people which is a charismatic skill

you're you're you're good at you're good

at seeing it and detecting it but the

conclusions you draw from it are based

on your wisdom I actually have

manage on inside checks mm-hmm yeah you

advantage just in general if I spend a

great point

thank you huh is that from being like a

boxer ah yes bloodhound bruisers freak

features so my yeah my school my

fighting school one of the things that

they're good at is like they're almost

like kind of sleuthy I get so sure

they're like the Baker Street Irregulars

yeah yeah like it's called the the

feature is called detective work yeah

as you gain proficiency with insight and

perception in addition you make an

insight perception ability check you

spend one box one grit greatly and gain

advantage on that ability yeah so this

is this is when you were younger when

you were younger and part of that and

probably a super useful thing to have as

a lieutenant well judge could just ask

maybe sweet hey what do you know

I'm not real playing judge but morally

if you think about we're looking at the

the journal yes you can't be does that

word word I'll clean this information

from yeah let's see here this was in

sight yeah okay so that's 22 um there

was certainly a little bit of self

aggrandizement yeah but uh but but no I

mean he seemed to be there are probably

he was presenting he and his troops and

some of the Ajax is best and they were

able to go toe-to-toe and knock some of

you guys have yeah right like no one

none of the rank-and-file guys in the

chain could do that right none of the

junior officers could do that right if

they if they walked up to suite with

crunch to them so you would not even

notice so even though you guys made

short work of them they probably are

some of Ajax's best but you know Ajax

has a whole bunch of different units

that he's gathered from all the

different places and a lot of places

defect a lot of places want to be a lot

of like elite troops soldiers armies

they want to be on the winning so it's

like dealt with exactly all these

different countries and

cheese and stuff there Delta forces some

of them want to be on the winning side

and so he has collected like they're

rumors now that the San scorpions who

are the Pharaohs elite troops now work

for Ajax that their commander defected

but there was a whole religious upheaval

so in in before Ajax ever got there in

cat Amara so he was yeah he might have

been like he certainly seemed to think

that if you guys went with him back to

the chrysalis that you know maybe like

you guys will all be executed

maybe not but that the chain would end

up being like this incredibly well

treated you know you'd be given wine and

great food and great uniforms and

whatever kind of kind of mates that you

prefer and treated like elite soldiers

so that you would love a Jackson fight

died for him because that's what he does

for the orcs yeah yeah like I much like

those works are yeah so there's a

certain amount of like hey we're the

best of the best Wow I don't know that's

probably not true but there's really

good yeah okay that's good and the

ledger just has lists has money paid out

to the troops money collected from

Ajax's Treasury and an itinerary and the

itinerary has them in in like in a

couple different places in black bottom

including dollar half and then it lists

a black bottom last and from black

bottom they're just going to a port city

treasury yeah then while they didn't

have a treasure like yours like the

commander had some money and the there's

a blonde list of places most recent

dollar wrath and then black bottom and

then the next was to and there was no

like he talks about in the ledger he

talks about receiving orders but what

those orders aren't you guys have you

guys don't see there's no record of

those what I'm just gonna pretend to

pick up the pick the contractor I'm

asking you to actually because he

probably know it where's Ken wait

Dora

he was and now he's the duke of Hendra

by the way yeah I believe you J whenever

he killed that kid that was part of the

process yeah um well there's no way for

judge judge doesn't know anything about

that stuff

oh right but we wouldn't would we have

heard about him ascending - no that's

all like super local politics in a

faraway place that the chain doesn't

care about or has not cared about up

until now I mean some of you guys are

from bad Lauria but like a sweet hood

grew up in the streets of Black Bottom

but that was you know 20 years ago right

and even then like dollar half dollar

ass is too black bottom like what

Saskatchewan is - Orange County it's

like right far north and a weird obscure

[Music]

I imagine well because anywhere I would

in in my mind that was like when you

were a teenager right so unless then you

have since risen and you wrote five

pages of backstory so I assume you're in

like your early thirties yeah I don't

think so is that a conversation you

might have amongst the crew of no I

thought we were look at the log sorry I

thought we'd like migrated to like a

different scene we can we can wrap up

the dinner with the and in fact if

there's anything else you remember you

want to ask these guys we can kind of go

back in time yeah and you can ask them

but otherwise well if you guys gonna be

full long rest

yeah so you guys are full some of you of

good alcohol all of you of food and then

hugely rich dessert

like you guys have had better meals cuz

you guys been all over the place but

this is some of the best dessert right

it's one of those things where they got

to keep they gotta keep the people happy

and the dessert is it a little money

make it really good

does judge not judge doesn't Tedesco to

Kadesh no cuts some of the putting up

and he's like how do you watch your

teeth so somebody drew fan art of judge

and gave him a little like spiky teeth

oh yeah okay like basically like his

he's got a mouth full of teeth I don't

know the reference I remember was the

the the guy who plays the flash what's

that guy's name there was a bunch of

pictures of Ezra Miller just rivers are

gay I was like that's fine I was like

yeah but that's what I remember about

Judge yes judge is a pretty boy yeah so

then teeth though is like it's like the

live-action version of Maleficent where

is Anjali Julia because I got sharp

cheekbones every smile it's like oh wow

yeah so when you say Ross your teeth I

think it was like well you would know I

think we're well supplied in the tooth

Department yeah more dessert you have

the best teeth of all of the Goblin

officers so yeah you guys are able to

talk after eating like if this is the

the before the dinner with the captain

there's a lot of you know the ship

business happening in and amongst around

you guys but after dinner you guys are

able to go back to your cabins or in

fact the captain can sort of tell that

you folks need to want to talk to she

goes the crew are going to go this is

we're all like first of all

so for us it's time to you know it's not

that kind of its yeah okay so we have

there were buried what okay so I don't

know or Britt is so there aren't just

half works walking around in the world

right just like there aren't half

octopuses in r1 orcs are distinct

species from humans and the way you get

half works is you have access to

powerful rituals and there may be other

people that have access to these rituals

but mortem definitely has access to the

ritual that makes F works and the half

words he made he called the war breed

and they are smarter than works all

right but there's your okay yeah there's

exactly they're smarter they're smarter

than it works they're way more

disciplined than arts they will take

orders labels self-organized like in the

absence I made me to tell them what to

do they will give themselves a hierarchy

but they are much stronger have much

greater endurance than men they'll fight

longer they're way more like savage and

and so from from Ajax the point of view

of the perfect soldiers and he can just

make more he can just make them and good

king moment who was kind of the first to

fall of as Lauri was the first country

to fall good Kano Minh has his own elite

shock troops couple though were the

dragon failings and they're all dragon

more paladins and the war breed broke

them the war breed were basically like

genetically engineered to stop the

dragon knights so that's what those guys

were there were half works so we're

going to the log and I think because we

discussed that you know how like why did

Ajax you love to that that seemed weird

and the guy was disguised also weird for

this contract well it's a little route

to kill sir yes to lure out serial I

think so he could get hurt I mean it

sounds like Sarah was pretty openly help

for Ajax yeah it means we are probably

in a bad spot for having taken a

contract with them as far as Ajax is

concerned they did know that this was a

secret mission that works on that boat

knew that we were there to make a strike

against yeah I I don't think even

mentioned the Wizards name but they know

that we were there to make a straight

which means which means that well they

don't know why we're there we just

finished up the contract and Pharaoh

we're spending all our money on correct

there's actually the old old cone and

role-playing game like you were

obligated there was a mechanic

that required you to spend like half of

your money on carousing like the town

went to [ __ ] and we showed up in Jeff

talked about with we have the Train

symbols on us it's not hard to pick up

who we are for notes though well correct

so I mean I guess I can make % about the

you didn't try to kill him

right yeah he made that comment and also

in a log here it shows they were just in

don't rounds before coming to black

bottom because I have dates see uh it

does it yeah it does but it's in yeah

and you can it's not in water like these

guys used what's called the old calendar

which is the caelian it's the same

calendar everybody in orden uses now

except the bannermen don't use it but

there are names for everything are like

Latin basically and every prayer every

place else in Orton he uses the same

calendar same number of months some

number of days in a week everything else

they just call everything by different

names and this is obscure using the kind

of the old names for the months and days

is seem like it's intentionally coded

could be seems pretty obvious that that

they were you know that that the Rebel

Alliance so to speak has somebody a mole

there's a there's a trigger yeah

somebody inves mean Ajax wouldn't have

shown up unless he knew yeah yeah I yeah

yeah he's not gonna show up for us he he

wouldn't have like he he knew that we

were there to try to assassinate mortem

otherwise he wouldn't have have

disguised another one of his agents

there and I don't think he would have

shown up himself unless he was trying to

unless he knew that there was a chance

that serial might show up right so

somebody betrayed lady serial and in a

roundabout way us us but you know we

were caught in the crossfire

it was lady Cyril Kenway there was

nobody else there cuz lady of Elena's

Kenway is like oh wait yeah lady emelina

wasn't she there - it was it was Kenway

just the three of us she's mentioned in

the contract yeah she's the only person

mentioned the contractor wasn't there

lady I Bolinas mentioned in the contract

you've got none of you guys have ever

met her this wasn't mentioned in the

contract yeah actually it actually

explicitly says like the contract is

technically from can't wait all right

because lady several doesn't have like

the legal power to enter into a contract

or she's a vampire and wouldn't do it

but Kenway Kenway says I'm the one

paying you guys to do this and if I die

and you guys complete the contract then

then any of these people will pay you

any lists lady serial Baron Nicodemus or

lady Ali oh yeah I think it refers to

Lydia Lina has his lieutenant and Alisa

is one of the Knights of the Kohl's I

think if you have a Vaz Lorien

background then you could probably make

a check and see how history check my

guidance though so you get an extra d4

on top of that it's pretty typical for

me to restrict who can make different

rules based on their characters

background cuz like I'm not Russian oh

wait there's no way there's no way I

would know something obscure about some

rolling culture it looks like somebody's

asking about Oh what's what's going on

with these weird elf things I'm like

well are you 22 yeah yeah okay sure yeah

you for the Knights of the coals are the

dollar wrath kind of secret police yeah

but I think there's only like there's a

really small number of them I don't know

if you would know how many they are but

the phrase that they use is like you'll

be dragged you'll be dragged over the

coals and right and a lot of people

think that that's a euphemism for just

you know

the Barons gonna come and grab you and

put you in the docks right but sweet has

probably been in in black bottom when

one or more of the Knights of the coals

has been there for various reasons

because black bottom is like the central

port city for the whole region so you

see people from dollar out there all the

time yeah cool I mean they are so the

people of dollar at especially like the

Knights of the coals are notorious for

being like chaotic good but super on the

chaotic side mm-hmm like chaotic good

question mark like by any means

necessary do whatever it takes because

they live right on the edge of I was

like to savage forests they're

surrounded by enemies and those enemies

are all barbarians or like elf guerrilla

warfare people so just like just being

alive up there is tough right and so

they have a very different idea of what

like good means Sariel had planned for

like wanted to make a stab at ajax

actually like she showed up and tried to

shank him it seems like that was kind of

her plan right the mist was there well I

guess meta cuz we know about cereal from

previous characters but her abilities

but the Miss World she showed up and she

stabbed at Ajax desperation thank you

guys here this long and sonorous can be

very musical this this echoes through

the walls of the ship you guys been on

ships before it's very eerie distant

almost banshee like sound

[Music]

mm-hm well I think I we're going to

alternate I might just do a quick round

to see if I can catch up with at least

cook I think and probably two shoes just

ask them sure you know how hot today go

so two shoes is up on the top deck and

it's very gonna go meet get to her

and she is talking to one of the one of

the watch one of the guys on watch yeah

okay

she'll excuse herself it's it's night

the ship as you know we it's easy for us

to forget but your characters can forget

that the ship is constantly you know

under these huge waves and it's getting

worse

like there's who knows how bad it's

gonna get but it gets progressively

worse with each hour it clear skies

stars constellations that I would

imagine that you guys would recognize I

don't know if judge recognizes the

constellations here in this world or how

much attention judge would ever paid to

it but yeah - shoes - shoes reports okay

she was if there is they're not telling

me she says I have my standards as she

was and many of these people do not meet

them but yeah she was she's like she's

talked to a lot of people they seem well

disposed to us they don't seem to having

a secrets they seem to be at least as

far as she can tell they are what they

seem they're a boat full of kind of like

look smugglers pirates legitimate

businessmen depending on you know

circumstances depending on circumstance

yeah they don't seem to be hiding

anything they didn't say they don't see

they certainly don't seem to be friends

of the war breed and they were happy

they were happy to see that you guys

annihilated them and she but and then

she says but I think you know they

enjoyed watching Ajax's troops dispatch

and they didn't like grab like whatever

group commander of order cough did when

he showed up they did not like it but I

don't think they were telling me this

but I think they're worried about what

happens to them now yeah do you think do

you think you'll still need for four of

the lower officers you're asking me in

my opinion absolutely I'm not sure the

four is enough these people don't have

law or rules they just what they can get

away with you don't worry you know what

real isn't like she was I think I think

that I think if left alone definitely we

would find that the chozo each one of

them I'm sure would only think oh

there's look how much money there is how

lonely they would quickly pick the lock

that will only take five or ten goal but

then every sailor ship doesn't money she

seems super judgmental is the issues

says judge two peas in a pod

is the Treasury itself like the physical

Treasury is it like protected yeah okay

so I'm gonna give her it's an expensive

lock but it's not yeah and there had

been the chronical talks about how there

have been times when the staff sorcerer

would make sure that only felt like

Casablanca quizzer lock on it but I

don't think nails has that best not

anymore man I'm gonna give her a she'll

use the lock of trickery do I have a key

to that how does that work I think

there's two keys and one is with the

treasure at all times and the other one

is with whoever the commander things

should have it so right now I think it's

like later good probably the commander

had sweet

because I don't think the previous going

to really wanted to worry about another

you take care of it yeah

plus there's very few people who would

want to try to take a key off the suite

and I want to get what her estimate is

for how many crew members there are you

try to get what yeah not not of ours

Matt doesn't know but it's you can do a

kind of a rough like how many we have

yeah I think it's on me I think it's

like no not really I think it's like

40-something okay

and that's considering like cramming

forty people onto this boat that's a lot

okay okay cool that's good you guys I

have to have multiple shifts you have to

have crew enough to man the ship 24

hours a day basically a skeleton crew at

night many many fewer people very little

motion out here there's a point where

judge is turning to leave having

finished talking to two-shoes about

what's probably planning on going back

to your cabin

and the ship plunges down just as it has

pubs or any times now but what's

happening is the sea is doing this right

and as the sea does this the boat is

going up and down and there's a point

where as you turn and you're looking to

port off the left side of the ship this

huge wave while you're going down this

huge wave is coming up and there's this

flash of lightning that illuminates the

entire wave in front of you and you see

in this wave only like a hundred feet

off the port of the ship giant eyeball

and it's looking really like focus not

what I've been the lights everything

lights up including you it suddenly

strolls around and focuses on judge for

a second and there's this sense this

deep sense of intelligence and soul in

this huge at first it's not easy to get

a glimpse of like what am I looking at

but it's awake it's just a whale in the

water and it's being lifted up as the

ship is going down

and it looks at you for a second and has

this moment of recognizing another

creature

and then the ship starts going up water

goes down and the white sir the

Lightning has left this green spots in

your eyes Kingsville said if only one of

them had taken whale as a language

[Laughter]

[Music]

[Laughter]

thanks to it thanks to the mod Lord

durog sleep sleep through the night

hard to get to sleep but many of you

were exhausted I mean you guys have had

like two days basic last day was like a

week long so even though in your full so

even though the ship is doesn't make it

easy

you guys are quickly to bed you wake up

and your cabins don't have windows so

it's not easy to tell what time it is

but just getting out of bed it takes a

couple seconds between putting your feet

on the and getting up and walking around

before you realize oh actually is the

ship moving a lot less and you exit your

quarters and walk up to the top deck and

the ships not moving unless you guys are

just starting to get your sea legs so

even though the ship is still and

there's this dull roar to port to the

left of the ship and the clouds are the

sky is now overcast

especially to the left of the ship it

gets this clouds get darker and darker

as you go to the west we're heading

north yeah so did we just I mean I asked

one of the sailors or whatever did we

just sail through that or is that but

we're trying to avoid sailing haha he

says but if you look you can see that

they're like the horizon does this weird

thing where kind of goes like

this and then there's just fog it's

miles away it's miles away but whatever

this storm

is it looks almost like it's deforming

the sea in this weird way and it takes

up the entire horizon at the entire sky

like you guys are heading that way into

what looks like just more very very

choppy water but the whole horizon to

the west is it looks like it looks it

looks right the edge of the world yeah

absolutely it looks like the edge of the

world yeah

how is it is that natural well you guys

have have you guys ever been from like

the guy Thunder never you ever seen

anything like that

well do you say it do you say that or do

you say is it natural asked him have you

ever seen anything like that

oh yes that's every time we every time

we journey to capital right or from

capital is that on the pony he was on

the left quite here's a port out to then

starboard on there yes is that normal is

it normal yeah well he's always there is

it natural because the Bale ciose the

the Maelstrom is always there is it

natural who can say this is every good

fantasy world has a yes Rose very meta

is this is this voyage always like this

is it always this row well no normally

we have charts and we have navigation

and we have taken the time to plan plot

but now we are sort of sailing

what does have you by the seat of our

pants says I think that's why NSA huh

that's reassuring

yeah so it's it's very early in the

morning it's shortly after dawn and good

to do standby and you hear someone in

the crow's nest call out and say is

disturbing and everyone turns around and

you can make out like if you from where

you guys are I don't think you can see

the captain because she's at the she's

at the wheel which is

like this deck is up here so it's it's

up from where you guys are but you can

seek Edisto because Kadesh no standing

at the front of that deck and he turns

his back to you guys so he's looking

actually from where you guys are going

this way it's yeah so it's if this is

north and the boat is going in that

direction then they're looking like in

this direction so behind them and to

starboard to the east and Kadesh toe

looks around he goes [ __ ] he climbs down

he calls out he goes dragon flies behind

us and the whole crew like mobilizes and

one of them turns and says we can't

outrun dragon flies and some other

captain will think of something we are

going to have an interesting day he says

to you guys

besides like the bug context so I'm not

sure that even guys know what this is

but you can if you climb up to the top

deck you'll see it yeah he's like oh you

again I was walking past you so when you

ask what's a dragon fly he says agents

of the overlord

what do they look like can you see them

I don't know well not not from down here

he'd have to get up no no I was gonna go

up yeah they're absolutely been up here

so you see these three they're very

small ships and my sister so the ships

they change their ships and their hulls

they're small they're much smaller than

this but they're three of them their

hulls do not touch the water they skim

over the top of those and the captain is

the captain Madigan has her hat on and

his experienced ship and when you guys

come up she's like we can outrun them

actually she's not be on shoes but you

can outrun them

how do those ships work I mean how do

they have wizards on them that's okay

she just says like they're magic yeah

so you've seen them before oh yeah well

work in the Abell though the last thing

they'll do is fight us she was the first

thing they'll do is they'll shred the

sails and pull down the masts and there

will probably won't be anything we can

do about it but but we're not we're not

done for yet she says and she calls out

she says first mate

summon the seer and you hear good éstos

voice down there call out some of the

seer and that command goes around and

she turns to you you guys are both up

there yeah you guys are both on the top

deck for the captain's deck she said she

says you're gonna love this hold on to

something is your tail prehensile can

you like lift things with it or is it

like a cat's tail words I don't think

it's like that it's not it's more like a

monkey's tail like as far as like its

ability but it's not like an elephant's

trunk God okay so it's yeah you can it's

reflexive and it'll do things like grab

on stuff but you start to see when when

the call goes out for the seer you start

to see them

strapping like they each start strapping

themselves and each other to the the

railings to the mast

everyone's tying each other down all

right well I think we should follow so

you got one hand the dragon the

dragonflies are these state of things

are cutting through the water and they

look like beetles they look like beetle

carapace as an egg they shimmer with

this golden reflection is crazy like

specular like their like their scarab

like they're a scarab beetle of halls

they're not organic their ships but

whatever they're made and they are fast

yeah can we see the people on them are

they not from not from here you mean if

they get close enough people

[ __ ]

those of you who are on the main deck

see coming up from below this old man

and he's got white hair he's bent and

hunched over he's so he's like gnarled

right he's either with age or just

repeated injury the way like bones have

been broken many times he'll strangely

high their old age or many fights and it

looks like he was once really tall and

not not reopened and probably not Vaz

Lorien and he's hunched over and the you

notice he's got the shock of white hair

he's carrying this like log like a piece

of wood broke it off at both ends that

has all these glyphs and only takes a

second to notice he has no eyes his

there but they've just they're just

grown over skin and as he comes up he's

shirtless he walks out onto the deck and

all of the different rioja and crew that

walked by him they all touch his back

every time he walks past them they have

this this weird pattern that they touch

on his back as he walks past you you

notice that he's got tattoos all over

his back he's got a grid of tattoos

that's four across and five deep and all

of the crew members are all tapping

these different glyphs in different

orders and then he rotates this log and

touches things on the lock code s toe

will just touch okay oh they are just

saying good to see they're saying you

look good that's how they talk to him

can't hear can't hear well no he was

born that way he was born without eyes

and he could not hear and then somebody

at some point decided that he did not

like the noises he made and then he cut

out his tongue but they searched the

church and he names the church the

church have saved their own egos at

church and in Rio and Capitol took pity

on him and took him it and he no one

knows where he got the I think it was

the church that gave him the speaking

stick is what they call it

and you know they they rehabilitated him

and and he earned a living there and

saved up enough money to buy passage on

our ship back to his homeland but the

problem is he does not know where he

came from

so when that when they touch the back

basically it's sort of like like

whenever like they're you know you do

the sign language yeah with people that

you know if you don't hear or see Harbor

science it's like that that's cool yeah

it's kind of chain sign yeah right and

he signs back he uses this log and he

touches things and people walking by and

get a good esto says oh he was just

saying how happy he is to see them in

fact he's tells that man that he that he

needs a haircut he says that all the

time he cannot see but no he doesn't

name but the seer is his job he has many

jobs on yes stand I grothy is his name h

h ra th I brought thee has many jobs on

board he assists the cookie is an

excellent cook he is great with spices

was very useful man to have on board but

yes he is also this year I think that

camera needs to be lower and flatter

because every little bit is very pretty

it's so highly perched than any little

any little motion causes that everybody

close your eyes nice for chat because

people looking at the tactical camera

also the whole world shakes chat history

has deduced that he has a a code names

yeah they've never been able to take him

home because he does not know where he's

from

right and we assume he is from vinegar

somewhere but uh where we don't know he

seemed he looks like a veterinary so

we're all strapping in yeah yeah he said

good effort says Wes rocky wants by he

says he says he will he will

I'm almost he's an old man he will

almost certainly died aboard their also

say hello but he will die among among

friends people who loved him he is a

very useful man hat it's part of the

crew and the seer goes up to the I think

it's the folk so he goes up to the deck

the very small deck the

up there and he starts chanting but

their words if you don't his Dan like it

so like it's it's not a language it's

some kind of ritual this guy has and

because he can't he has he can make

noises with his throat but he cannot

particularly alright and his voice gets

louder and louder like like Ajax's like

supernaturally loud and it's this where

someone like Tuvan throat-singing

it's this weird long sonorous vowels and

almost like he's able to harmonize with

himself he's able to make two tones at

once and create these overtones and the

dragonflies are getting closer and the

ship at one point starts to get closer

and closer to the Maelstrom this massive

so large you can't see the other side

huge gaping maw in the ocean our ship

gets closer to the Maelstrom yeah on

purpose who are you gonna who you gonna

ask that - well you're up here oh yeah

so in a capital

what are you doing captain what are we

doing

she says she points to the Maelstrom and

she says you want to escape the

dragonflies there's only one way in and

then cadets tow says through and the

whole crew chokes beyond and the ship

starts to angle into the Maelstrom in

this it's mostly this is like a giant

wall of water the even the edges of

which like you can't that just curves

off into mist miles before you miles

behind you and the dragonflies are now

close enough that you can see the crew

and they're all catamites they're all

from the they're all from the infinite

desert they're all delves deep tan skin

they're all bald

and but these these ships don't have the

signal of the Pharaoh on them they have

the signal of Ajax invincible

and that's those guys but yeah so now

that rumor is confirmed and the ship at

one point angles like that that's on the

edge it's dipped into this Maelstrom and

it's on the upper edge you have no idea

how far down it goes you can't you can't

see the bottom again just missed and now

the mist is is it's this fog that's

everywhere and the ship goes up slightly

and then starts to cascade down and

starts to ride down into the Maelstrom

like it's quite a go instead of going

like this it's gonna go across and this

is like whatever was happening before

with the waves was nothing compared to

this this is like it feels like you're

going straight down it feels like the

back of the boat is gonna flip over and

throw you guys all into the abyss and

strapped in are you guys all by the way

reopens come up to you and they and they

they have ropes and they offer they're

gonna tie you to something yeah does

anybody not want to be tied to anything

big cat does not would be I think it's

got a harness big catch has to being

harness for so you can you can harness

he's got one chemical around meeting

trying to stress like there like just

does copper need to be hard it seems

like big cats tentacles are stronger

than any rope we might use and so as you

guys are heading into the Maelstrom

going down this incredibly steep pit

giant ocean white pit of water there's a

wall of water coming toward you

impossibly like it's not if there's no

way physics would allow a solid wall of

water to start rushing up and it's like

60 feet high and it's headed straight

toward the front of the boat and you can

hear the real ones talking about how

like you know whatever is in there

doesn't want people to go through

and as this wall of water gets closer

and closer you can see it's dark it's

black like the see around here is it's

not it's stormy but this is this

incredibly inky black wall of water and

in the wall of water you can see stars

and the chanting from the seer continues

until it's the only thing you can hear

and as the wall of water approaches the

ship about to crush it and destroy it

and prevent the Rosso Cielo from

entering the Maelstrom lightning bolts

start to stab into the water and the

ship smashes into this tidal wave and

everything goes white and there's no

sense of there's no pressure

there's no the water never hits you it

looks like it's about to fall on you and

the lightning bolts fill your eyes until

you can't see anything else and when

you're done blinking and your eyes

resolve you're on a flat sea there's no

Maelstrom there are no dragonflies

there's this fog up in the air not on

the ground and the fog up in the air

it's there's there's light up there like

a Sun but you can't see it and it causes

light to come from everywhere it's as

weird diffuse effect where suddenly

there are no shadows it feels as though

the ship is in a giant room like a giant

like that's that feeling of this really

well-lit interior but there's water

everywhere it's just not and the real

ones are all like and they start untying

each other and you notice that nails has

collapsed to the ground and he is

unconscious and I will see everybody

next week I think that's the stream

folks yeah we're just gonna hang out and

leave the cameras running while people

have their after-action discussion and

then at some point I will hit the I

don't know if I have a we're done but

actually

don't think I do I know you just know

so at some point we will say goodbye but

I'm gonna let I'm gonna instead of us

hanging up and this discussion happening

afterwards we'll just leave the cameras

right but look at what's right right now

yeah we're going to be live until work

until at least for a little while well

we can keep like since the chat this

tool is this is the is a stream Stone

Ranger yes okay because there's a button

that tells me how many people are

watching and there's like you have

you're a healer what do you do I do a

medicine check on them I mean he appears

to be unconscious not sleeping like like

he just took how I was like he's out of

hit points

yeah yeah medicine check stabilize

somebody he doesn't appear to be dying

oh these are not stable yeah he appears

to be unconscious not asleep the

condition doesn't curb again he's not

bleeding

how would you heal somebody who was

wounded yeah well no I can't burn a

spell Salah right now but I'd rather

kind of glean the cause of what's going

on I've had experience of this I heal

people often yeah so yeah go ahead make

a medicine check medicine yeah okay 16

plus 7 plus 1 you have no idea you know

I definitely like it's like a spell

actually it's very like a spell was cast

on him you know imagine imagine sleep

actually it's like something just cast

sleep on you've seen that you've seen

that before although you've never seen

somebody else's money listen to this

experienced just pass out like that can

I am I your unconscious dreaming nope so

or if you are well tell you what you're

doing what happens like Joel soul or

whatever like you're trying to wake him

up

just like nothing you want to use like

one point of your lay on hands

equivalent so I don't burn a slot yeah

sure

alright so I put my hand nice chest and

then I use my infernal conduits opening

opening a conduit Asmodeus and hands for

help

that's my HP so you lose you lose one HP

Markoff interesting the ill rigger

transfers some of his hit points to

nails and --nails goes and wakes up and

of course you being the point fit you

are startled because the first thing you

notice is his eyes or solid silver

anyway

[Laughter]
