[Music]

hi everybody welcome to the show my name

is Matt Koval these are my friends we're

a bunch of game developers we get

together on Wednesday nights and play

Dungeons & Dragons how long has it been

since lat I feel like it's been two

months it's been like a month

you play yeah if you are curious what's

gonna happen tonight and you want to

open your Christmas present early we do

have a patreon and I post my notes on

patreon for people that pledge it's a

five-dollar level and above and if you

just want to see behind the scenes you

wait about a week and I'll probably post

it for everybody it depends on how far

how quickly these players chew through

the content I have no real understanding

of what happened last time we played oh

that's right

there was the you guys had just somebody

had just been possessed by the mind

killer and down in ring well but I have

repconn that I already told the players

this last week you folks couldn't hear

us cuz our audio wasn't working if

you're wondering what happened last week

the answer is the audio didn't work so

there was no last week but after having

thought about it and thinking about how

the mind killer works I retcon what

happened so that slims what does that

attack you do that frightens people

menacing assault slims menacing assault

causes the mine killer to retreat back

to its own plane which neatly solves all

of the fuck-ups that I made disappoint

we're gonna find out like who's the

greater predator Vincey prince or the

xenomorph

he'll be fine he'll he'll realize it's

not made out of cat fruit and he'll stop

anyway yeah anyway bla bla so yeah so

the the you guys have your map yeah let

me pick up and we'll describe where we

worried what happened so here you folks

are in this a part of ring well which is

a large circular room we see a large

circular room with many smaller cells

leading off all of the doors are open

and one of them almost certainly

contained the mind killer which you

folks defeated so all right well anyway

since we made such short work of that

guy cells my go check out the moment the

crumbled jade door

the entire interior of the room appears

to have been covered in Jade and it's

all disintegrating and as you stand

there in the doorway watching it you

here kind of going clink involved mm-hmm

like she's been freshly attacked or

whatever you caught magic that kept it

together like is starting to fade away

in one part otherwise empty otherwise

empty who all's hurt Phillip emotionally

a prayer of healing minutes okay so I'm

just gonna do that while you guys like

that so how does that work again so 2d

eight plus four for up to six people so

one two three or okay it's why is this

most of us just coming to the room it's

just a rich plastic at 9:24 the cat's

gone but that's something to get on

other streams folks so to d8 + slow

disintegration behavior behind the grade

walls are being revealed as the pieces

of

fracture and collapse the regular ring

well walls you're using sandstone

there's images that once carved into

them but are now eroded and impossible

mr. Beckham pokey boy Darnell have a

peek in one of these cells in mr. pig

one go you're getting a gold you ain't

in the Jade I'll go I'll have a look at

the one next to go other so the the the

one and that judge inspects that has a

sealed door that rolls I once had gold

in in the runes on the door keeping the

seal active and that golden sounds in

that room is empty and the doors open

and the gold has melted out of it all

the other rooms are all the same as each

other which is there there not only the

empty there standing open okay the doors

are standing open and there's dust all

over it even inside the rooms as though

they've never been used

okay and there's nothing apart from that

there's nothing else in this area right

this room's just things in this circle

jade room gold room empty cells there's

dust inside know that the Gold Room is

does not have any dust it no debts no

now that is the Jade room only has

fractured fractured Jade in it Jade is

something that you know in medical terms

was used to stop man hence Ajax's jade

hand destroying in the master so

personally you folks don't know if you

know your characters have any experience

with like actual jade doing that that's

just something from mythology but

obviously please Taran ring well and for

Ajax it's real in the room that has the

gold pedal with one of it there's that

was completely up whatever was in here

potable has escaped yeah because the

golden was stealing is like a golden

seal on the door it was melted like the

other the other door what he's gonna Sun

it again right yeah it's it looks it

looks like a pool of gold it's

completely solid it melted it flowed out

of the runes in the door

that pretty smelly not ship a bit is

gold off okay yeah I mean that's a big

job a gold

sure yeah we've learned a little bit

about leach yeah I mean you can if you

ma'am er at it you get out like a take a

dagger out or something okay you can sit

soft it appears to be pure gold lovely

other than that you should mean you can

you know show exile around no secret

doors disappearing to be a dead end we

could either we go they go back to the

room where the iron golem was and in

that case very dangerous you go first

or we could we could kind of with you

campout we could rest up with the

recharge the crystal and we could try to

free this person well we might as well

try to clear out the iron golem there's

also this we know about iron golems do

you know anything slim and I absolutely

it's also Chronicle its yeah make a

history check and I also take exile with

me and check each other I also try and

take because if I'm kind of like oh

there's mythological thing is that jade

is kind of anti magic about that Island

stone of awareness oh it's the date I

won and see if it actually kind of do

yesterday did no in fact as soon as you

go to like pick up a piece of jade it

turns to dust I only got Nate so I got

nothing I mean they're tough you know

that the chain is dealt with iron golems

before in fact the chain is most

familiar with it how close I think the

chain has employed iron golems before

it's just you can't be can't feel that

sure the The Chronicle is so large and

old that it can take hours to find a

reference II remember well should try

and employ him

would offer a job what was sir while I

wasn't around what was the deal I'm

trying to get the lady out of the

[ __ ] we were here for any of that nah

were you gone for the entire lady

volunteer thing a couple of weeks I was

gone for yes so quite a beer that so

there's this lady but didn't you say if

you charged up your yeah they're trying

to get slim to give up you're not too

keen on that what Slim's not Sookie I

don't think you would be like that thing

allows him to be if I can slang machine

yeah I wouldn't get rid of that I mean

mind you son was pretty badass before

that too

well yeah but it's better else now yeah

madarao sure yeah it's a matter of do we

think the contacts gonna be worthwhile

and gonna lead us to doing better stuff

to refresh your memory especially

because OD was not here you asked lady

of Valencia whom you folks know like

lady violent is a real person this isn't

her this is somebody to discuss it has

been transformed into her okay and you

King asked her whether or not she knew

how to get into ring well because

there's a door a large much larger than

the other doors sealed runic door with

gold in it that the black iron packed

opened with a wish

yes and lady Arosa bar saw that happen

and closed the door and the seal

regenerated oh so unless you got a wish

you're probably gonna get back in but

there is what appears to be a large

round keyhole it's about this long that

has all these mechanisms inside it and

King asked do you know how to get

through that door and lady a lady said

yes mm-hmm-hmm and she also is in this

predicament that she's in because she

infiltrated the black iron pack was the

other idea we had when we were talking

last week because we think leeches

patron something to do it gemstone oh

yeah if they might have an idea

on how to get rid of this wall but I've

only just basically pleaded to him yeah

you're gonna like to go in theory

well no it's been like a dare to die

okay so I think you guys have taken at

least one I've definitely long but now

that now all the monkeys are in this one

room the cows lion has decided to

destroy yes I was on ebay to die so

that's yeah very unlikely that you would

you in fact a good chance that you'd get

a ball and chain stuck to your leg

yeah except yeah it's a wonder bad OD

the Sapphire sky I believe somebody who

talked to the Sapphire sky didn't they

they've got they've got like one or two

gemstone dragon born in their employ

okay and the one that the one that I

spoke to oh I just said that he reckons

if we could round up another three or

four more right but they'd be able to to

you know band together and will this

wall too so for those of you watching at

home who might not have been around for

this the chain of Akron are exploring a

dungeon ring well which has been hidden

awake world a few people know exists and

even fewer know where is and there's an

enemy team called the black iron pact

who were actually a cult of Ajax who are

thee of was opposed to the chain of

Agron who were down here ahead of these

folks and well this night they meant had

chased one of them and she was trapped

inside one of the wards that are

supposed to keep things safe down here

and that person is lady of Olympia and

she has told a black iron she's told the

chain that she's not really she was a

spy that she infiltrated the black eye

impact and she's trapped behind this

impenetrable psionic barrier and she's

trying to she's slowly trying to

convince the chain of Akron to help her

get out and they are slowly figuring out

how to do when when she said she could

open up that log did you do like a check

to see if she was telling the truth or

do you just go with it

Matt just says what what do you think

checks don't know I think all depends

Dom you won't do that oh you got that

was his favorite toy then thank you

Jason

Jason won't play but Vince will Meldrick

at night thank you for the service elder

spine straight as my daddy

yeah glove oh ho ho thank you yeah

sorry so well I mean if you want to make

a check you can but yeah there to it

what Lars is referring to is that there

are times when I don't think your

character has any reason to know more or

less than you do i and so making a role

isn't gonna solve the problem of do we

trust or if the question is do you trust

her yeah okay fair enough

but actually no that was I don't believe

anybody made any role or even asked know

what you can go back and she's she's

unless unless the situation's radically

different than it was last time you can

go back and ask her she should still be

in there it's a it's a it was it's been

minutes I think since we last you know

well yeah cuz you went down you went

after you rested you and down to talk to

her and then you went and fought the

mind killer yep

so if we're not gonna use my patron we

know slim doesn't want to use his stone

we haven't got any more dragon bones

then just a month well here's here's the

which I will remind you of is that angel

knows what that room is it's called a

god blind know and it is it is a it is a

Gor blimey it is a room that is designed

to make it impossible to scry into

either with spell or prayer even the

gods can't see it so when you talk about

your patron yeah patron might not even

know that room it's like a it's like a

no room judge did an augury saying if we

do this second of thing will it be good

for the chain or bad for the chain and

Asmodeus went yep do you mind what we're

busy room basically yeah

so yeah anyway and there's more good

engine transport yeah yeah I think well

we gotta get by that I think that would

be is curiosity you know there's

something I don't know what well I mean

you know the gods aren't like omniscient

omnipresent they have a lot of power but

well I guess we'll labor for this we

keep going yeah after you actually

that's the hull yeah so either maybe we

go back this way yes yes I assume that

thing's gonna be bad man I'm I don't

know I don't I get so stressed before we

played a dealer all day my stress halls

right but then for whatever reason once

we're playing I'm like man hello I miss

playing D&D there we should do it

copper's very sneaky sneak ahead to see

if like the stone golem sir yeah well

we're gonna go when you walk into the

room now you can see where the hole was

and now there is a metal plate there

isn't it looks like it looks as though

that this metal kind of extends under

the floor mmm thanks from below no like

like like like if you went anywhere else

on the floor and just dug through the

sandstone that we'd hit no oh like it

looks like it goes into sandstone and

mill boy we call get your arrow back

then well no okay

not unless that unless somehow the

yawning girl have transformed himself

into a floor big cat big mm-hmm with one

tentacle big cattle you everything seems

fine okay big catches kinda sit so is

there any visual differences between the

two hallways that lead out of

just room that's good question um the

only one is I mean well we've kind of

not not not to the not to the

undiscerning I know about the Senate

annoy well I mean you wanna make a roll

like an investigation check searching

like it's D&D like a searching for traps

and stuff what's going on here know I

miss anything

you don't notice [ __ ] yeah no it's it's

what you've gotten used to with ring

well where there's no flat cert there's

no straight lines even the floor is very

very slightly beveled so the haver where

you look whoever built this place

originally which was not the Emperor

whoever built this place originally

wanted to make sure that it didn't have

any straight lines I think what I'll do

is I've got like ball bearings so I'm

just gonna go to like the edge of where

the hallway begins on one side and then

I'm gonna put down a ball bearing and

see if it rolls no that doesn't roll

down the hallway what do you do if you

put a ball bearing in any of these rooms

or the corridors it'll slowly even if I

put it like show me the hallway judge

Carey's ball bearings around yeah he's

got adventures we take a bag of them

yeah

can be throw him on the ground and run

and some etrade chasing you falls over

from judges younger days when he was

third level fourth level wouldn't he

couldn't just you know [ __ ] so even

in a court if you drop it in the

corridor it doesn't roll down the

corridor it was to roll - so the

corridors are level okay we only send

out day down wonderful tricky tracks

classic or lock familiar that's true

yeah on census anyone's we do it's

probably explore please shan't now

alright oh D will reluctantly flap his a

flap this way ten more subs from

eldritch night thank you thank you guys

okay so oh we're going north or south

I'm no elf

North novo RF nope yes he's Annie's

invisible you come too so it goes down

10 20 30 40 by 50 feet opens up into a

small room it's 20 feet right 20 foot

wide circular room and there's are there

are crates and tools in here and there's

blood on the ground any any other exit

to that room yes there is more corridor

the curves as an archway no door is an

archway and the corridor if I called

right for you one it's not it's not

actively relevant to what's going on

right this second but it is dungeons

fresh fresh fresh are these tools

ancient as is the rest of the dungeon or

are they so you hearing hearing boots

you direct OD and zooms and he picks up

the tools and looks at them in the other

there actually you've seen tools like

this in a lot of Caelian art they're

like really old

Caelian empire construction tools okay

so like you know imagine the type of

things you would see in like depictions

of the making of the pyramids and stuff

like that right not modern like not a

lot of ropes and pulleys and stuff like

that so I had a crates open or some of

them are yeah it's can eat we have a

peek in there Odie

there's like one crate that's just full

of nails they're all rusted the other

crates have dust in them mostly mm-hmm I

don't actually [ __ ] off hand-drawn

circle I want to make an entirely

circular dungeon not good it goes come

quick listen

don't stab yourself pro-pro drawer

actually try drafting class metals a

spirit of arterial lines to the Dennis

they're like they drilled in root canal

and she said there was a volcano of

blood that sounds cool I didn't feel

like I think you feel great

I thought my Vincey pronoun let's get

scarpered big cat yeah so I DS flapping

around in here at environment and

there's a mouthful of nails so now I was

crazy yeah there's so there's old tools

basically anything that's not metal

there's even like a t-square in here

that was made out of wood but when OD

goes to pick it up to look at it so you

can see all of the wood just cooked

crumbles it was I was it wasn't even

being held together yeah there's a blood

trail anyway can I it trails into this

room and then stops okay it's problem

yeah it's from where you guys are like

it's if it starts in the corridor vodi

goes bad now that he's seen the blood if

he goes back you can see little tiny

droplets of blood leaving him oh no does

it look like you said it wasn't fresh no

I know it wasn't wet so it's not wet but

if he goes in and touches it if OD

touches it it's it's it's almost

completely dry but not completely uh so

that's fairly fresh I remember blood

dries quick maybe see iron golem blood

[Music]

well what's further down there yeah

let's keep on woods ID on woods I put

all the room descriptions on cards so it

would be harder for me to confuse myself

in my notes remember it works yes they

have letters numbers are so passe all

right yes so this is a similar room as

the previous one except there are a lot

more there are no crates in here there's

a lot more tables that have vellum which

is still preserved and there is all

sorts of drawings on here and that's

basically

this you can see you can see I've like

I'll tell I did it for you trini crazy

got that map oh yeah they're ancient

drafting tables in here and there are

many documents on most are now rotted

but some still have writing okay we've

seen no ages where is it now I think yes

and I okay Jane you whatever I you are

the other way Anna if you hold it up and

move it over it might be on screen do

that's the huge improvement action huh I

think we should go to this room and see

if there's any other documents or things

just quickly I'll be well enough we

could also maybe city in there nice

don't see if she can get a cent from

this blood hey it's dr. basil

it's dr. basil doctor dr. basil MD I

remember your username happy birthday

dr. Manson doctor dr. basil MD it's like

home dr. basil doctor yes says these

rooms seemed fairly harmless we could

perhaps his best together

take a look hmm there let's go for we go

to G oh thank you for the gifted saps

dr. Besson so your birthday but the

community gets the presence off do you

come on so there are several blueprints

that you can inspect you have to be

careful with him when you pick them up

because even though they aren't vellum

it's been long enough that they will

crack and break and you can see that all

the maps all show the same thing it's

just that they've got layers on them so

like I thought you got may copy them

though or I'm sure it's fine oh is that

daggers like this right

the cats can climb on top of the

meniscus in The Chronicle just so we

have it okay yeah that's a good idea

so this is like like multiple floors no

it's more like it's it's like one of

them is just empty and then there's one

that has sketches saying like you know

the cauldron and it points here and then

another one's crossed off and says the

rod points here and then and they slide

there's there's a handful of Journal

notes left in here that you can recover

but even as you gonna pick things up

like as a document and you can read the

words disintegrate who's doing the

inspecting I mean I assume we all came

in here one he's the one who can read

everything so if I only in language we

can read or I want that burn hole in it

oh that's cool meat you can read it it's

it's you can read it it's old its old

Cillian I think I think at this point

you guys have seen enough it's the

modern language it's just like the

difference between if the psyche we're

trying to read The Canterbury Tales

right we'll get one each that we bought

put what out of order made this really

difficult for us well you can't you

couldn't tell what were they read well

I'll just I'll just read mine it's it's

indiscernible and then dot dot dot

thinks they were obsessed with curves

and arcs this maybe but I think they

built this place for much the same

reason we need it now to keep something

in and the complete absence of straight

lines and lack of any symmetrical axis

as part of the containment geometries of

course there is now no way to and then

it's all crumbly and ancient

that's as far as I can get like me much

debate we agreed the greater Ward's

would be sealed inside the other vaults

should the forbidden says file the

future should not change mm-hmm he's a

pretty key

yeah are you here is time never fought

never found a Houston never found a use

for the rest they remain empty do I feel

somehow this place will attract power

evil maybe and other things too yeah

engineer disagree but speaking for the

gods I agree we would collect the evils

in this level their proximity to illios

even in his prison may restrain them

further

Ilyas was the name of the Sun why right

yeah if I may sir has agreed to remain

here as the final seal a mortal unending

to assure the power within remain sealed

away realizing the sacrifice his friend

was making the Emperor wept

we forgot sometimes behind the presence

of a god that's the Sun elf hmm good

luck sleep dot dot dot that just means I

can't read this part yeah okay yeah work

is done future generations will know our

sacrifice

I believe law and civilization will

eventually lead to utopia and equality

man I care not over much for the history

of 3,000 years the emperor seeks to

protect but we live longer and enjoy

more freedoms than our forefathers must

we be destined to something barbarism

all it will take is sealing away the

knowledge and eradicating the cult of

[Music]

yes we have done these words should pass

unread into eternity if any read this

know then that we failed to write the

author

so it's ears to be a [ __ ] well it

sounds like these are from the people of

this place

Yeah right like because they mentioned

even if things fail like the machine

itself will still work to entrap

something in fact give me the mace on

those circular yeah even the

money-making like tenets areum things

that like spin I can't like of course

that's what it is it's an orrery mmm see

yours remember the use of solid black I

mean things unreadable oh wait I even

burn burn all this all the black squares

from that one time we had to add a

redacted text of it yeah I vote on oh

wait oh yeah Jason help with this oh

yeah it's the name of the cult is what's

burned up we just need to keep the Ebell

thing so it sounds like when you're i

some prevent boxes are fine he's a catch

yeah you'd be young kitty gotta bounce

back you the color there are labels

showing all right what i say i'm on auto

phase and cold room of suriname will run

on cool drink its Zorin on now yeah yeah

all sound OD down there and let's see

what we see any anything else in here

we've done in h so where we are Timon

hey I mean do we want to like actually

bust again that was G we've do we

leads in here and then stops it leads

into it leads into this room yeah yeah

we did we won't strike through G into H

let's let's see if we can get a trail on

that no body or anything on that yeah

yeah oh yeah deep or let's see what am i

that's right mmm you got your cool new

the deck of many animated still can't

see if there's any tracks that lead lead

anywhere we're in the bloody room right

well no blood room you had to walk

through the blood room to get to the map

room it's ok so where the map room now

yeah I'll go back to the room the blood

in it and see if I see any trucks there

are our cars the new team you see

footsteps footprints like booted

footprints that lead in here and lead

out here roughly like Dragonborn night

sighs good detective work sir then go

ahead and send it D okay I'm gonna send

no D down to Elle Elle Elle I'm gonna

say a no d2l page Auto page visible

would I take his eyes

there's a door ah at silver there's a

silver roomed door blocking us blocking

your way into L into L outs at door into

that remove now Oh silver yeah hmm

anything he can look at and see it looks

like it looks like the wound non-major

doors you've seen it's like two types of

room doors there's normal human sized

ones and then there's big ones and the

big one you saw is still locked and is

one the black iron pack made it through

and this one's here also in gh this is

just

ongoing thing but I'm gonna continue to

use exile to check yeah I'll let you

know if there's a secret or anything

that's good well well just just as we go

back through gee you said there was some

crates that were still shut yeah

whatever like she said oh I have a

looking one I mean as soon as you try to

open up the crate the wood concrete just

starts to collapse and there's little

pieces of like straw inside uh-huh you

know but the rest of its just dust and

the cry any one cried she's full of

nails

yeah to the brim yeah oh so low now

isn't it for crate anyone want to know

strange is it like this entire place is

like stonework where would they use a

nail yeah what would they been nails for

the crates could just take the rest of

nails why we want to there's the nails

they're kind of like they belong in the

museum shall we carry on to the silver

do ya silver door Salvador's

situation we should be careful yeah yeah

well out of phase that's like something

that eats itself yeah yeah it's it's

like a knight's process or like yeah all

right we're gonna slaughter

there's this door with the silver stuff

on it look like the other doors with the

golden runes on it but it's just silver

all those doors are our civil doors with

runes in them and some of them have been

sealed with goal meaning that the runes

is it's the runes are like carved into

the door and then someone pours liquid

golden and fills it in right except it's

not planets and this is that same kind

of door except it doesn't have any

golden Oh

anybody so we know that it says auto

fish right yep and a couple of us know

what that word kind of means do anybody

here is it like a poison or was it I was

wondering it's like if anybody has like

resistance to poison who might be better

if they go in first kind of thing D

resisted the boys oh really

not any Masri toys sorry at sea of

course it matters to me if you die means

you've got a caster ritual war back yeah

some effort but we can't open it you

can't it means it's a shoe IDs strong

enough to know so anything anything

written around the door and not freezes

the bike in the other room no only only

that one door that you haven't opened

yet that leads into further into ring

well and that kind of like yeah I can

augur fear around it and this is at the

end of the hallway right correct the

hallway ends with this door that doesn't

work anymore surrounded by magic yeah

you'd have to like no you'd have to like

take off all your magic Center reels

three feet away and then stand there

without any magic on

does anybody have tech magic but what do

you do do we think we know what that

creature would be in there use the tech

magic just go it's magic the presence of

magic is to determine school see very

useful I guess I don't have it for today

well is it a pulled or a push door let's

uphold or push it he's pulling just rent

it I'm gonna like

search for traps I'm just gonna like

just like touch the handle and then

pretend like nothing happened

rustling okay is the door open

have you didn't know no one's open as

far as I have now you just told you did

all right I'm gonna grab the handle I'm

gonna crack it open it you can say okay

let's flip over lets or clean this off

or flip it over or whatever comes the

atif age I closed it where's the wipey I

think what you say drew that Millennium

Falcon and I've often thought that the

dungeon map you're like I want like a

cutout so I feel closer so I can have

more table I can be I can so like yeah

and so Jay seems like like the

Millennium Falcon right oh [ __ ] that's

exactly what is but probably not just

like the money in Falcon I think it's

you but the people who made this table

by the way table by Wrath scholars quite

happy with them and this they offered to

make us like a custom table like you'd

have to get you out and spray how do you

shoot it keeps ducking everybody well

one I'm gonna send you to your room

sorry right beat you know everything's

heavy

I see you're mad please don't go to the

gym it makes you weaker I guess he

already knows this looks like right but

this one's like it's a circle it's a

little round root it is it is but it's

like I think 30 feet around it's good

where's your compass thing boots I'm D

right he's in the front okay good yeah

it's like one of these oh it's the one

that we're about to enter it's not

that's probably not to scale yeah if

it's double there okay so yeah yeah the

room is actually bigger than what it is

yeah it was actually a door here so what

is he out of a cage

Altaf age so can you draw that please on

your big map this is how I normally run

any kind of catechol series of casual

things is they have their verge on the

map and they tell me where they want to

go I say Kenny mapa and I draw what they

see next here I draw what they see next

and I hand it back to the message of

them to draw it on the thing and so they

have a costume because is one of those

10 or yeah one of those is 10 K so

double whatever then so 4 times 4 is 10

one of those is 5 yeah so if one of

those is four of those yeah so like I

just said this this is each square here

is 10 and a square here is 5 right so

ever so though over by for everyone is

to II mean what is if 1 square is 10 to

my each one H is for one of the two

major 4 to 1 there's a 5 foot 1 square

becomes a 2 by 2 share too much so it's

a 20 foot so it should be radius room I

had

or four it's 30 right cuz you got ten

wanna see one in this room wait what no

one this one down here

no we're down there I'll take four to

one

where's the give me that six states

right oh my god

everything's our guy let me criticize

you don't sit down

[Laughter]

squash cats huh yes Vince is like a

medium now mm-hmm definitely said mrs.

Slocombe notes we could have done this

he likes to sit in the chair in order to

get my attention I mean it's one more 40

feet be a correct but that's because I

couldn't do half squares on that one I

shoulda pre-drawn it my fault my fault

you know who are like I have better

things to do than watch these people

failed to draw Rob what's in that gap

yeah so I read and draw the door and

then the corridor leading out and then

you can put yourselves out there where

[ __ ] is and I'll describe what you see

are you so mad Oh like that maybe I see

what you say can you draw the corridor

so we can have your minis either oh [ __ ]

it's free handed it yeah yes the way

hashtag for all artists yep that's what

you do nice corner alright we order from

right here yeah

okay who's tough beyond him me move

who's the next tough well

slim is the toughest out of all of us so

new and me closer up are you good don't

matter they seized I believe the corners

isn't beep ten feet across

it's okay we'll make it up okay what we

get in if you want yeah that's cool

[Music]

[Laughter]

shoulder room full of what appear to be

like mummified corpses well full well

[Laughter]

there's

about a dozen of them layered around the

room all in various stages all various

stages of contortion long dead mummified

leathery and they have holes all through

their skin yeah like that

yeah but these are mummies that have

holes big I can roll die there is a door

okay that's not who use your boobs to

kind of dance true very they're the very

distinct musty aroma that comes out was

that and you see that like big cat guy

goes Gallican I don't really trust them

see their mix yet not fine candy but the

holes look like they've been pierced no

they look more like what you would

expect to see something they've been

like infected with maggots and they dug

in all areas growing brains so any who's

who's taken back such coal has liked it

so how many it was a little bit of

eruption all right it's like a little

you did it

so could you describe if you want to see

an illustration just get that how many

of these things do you think are gonna

come to life

yeah the fire point as you folks are

talking about what to do about this you

see these little thank you dust

particles that are mostly near the floor

and and they are now sprinting out

across the hallway and the little dust

particles that catch to the light a

torch light or whatever like you're

using they start to grow into a little

like bacteria that you can see

[Music]

eventually like little worms as he shuts

the door on the count of three just

blast it bodies in here don't appear to

be doing anything but these infectious

worm-like agents are within a matter of

seconds growing into man-sized enemies

it's missing doors fire balls we make

the dod guys on me right this corridors

go caught big innit

well because it's 18 foot across no no

I'm doing that going No so sort of like

yeah do you know how numbers work at all

[Music]

and it's like this is fine we'll just be

in here and I'm like ok so my ability to

tactically represent what's happening is

somewhat limited so they look like this

they look like this like a person who's

made out of workers

okay they don't look like skeletons it's

like the thing from okay yeah looks like

that

[Music]

I just a little 20 and then I became for

real it was a three you can keep the

three if you'd like and the 20 no you

can't if you roll together leaps what's

your initiative

it's a marvelous six awesome you're my

favorite judge king also five eight

boots eight drew dead you guys are

surprised obviously copper 24 like hey

guys guys I've seen worse before never

good oh yeah what's up Lux debating run

yeah so we can turn on the blender the

blood miriam ham what do you mean so I

can hate the slim

[Music]

then use a bonus action to give another

attack and then you can just I can you

move around in me uh oh we like well

Crandon nobody can please interact the

stuff that's next on mmm the phage I

shake it probably becomes better yeah

well no matter what no it's not locked

so yeah there is these worm creatures

surrounding you guys copper okay zoinks

everything okay with her yeah I just

always forget the close combat situation

with range you're basically just a

disadvantage if there's someone next to

my own up to do yes I do

okay there's somebody's standing next to

you it's dispatch manager

no okay I ain't going nimble escape you

going to escape nimbly escape nimbly

yeah okay so I get back I mean these

three okay so I'm gonna do heal thorns

Paola thorns thorns all within five feet

of target take damage is any one big cat

it's hard to tell King big cat and then

great

alright I'll just do a normal attack

okay all attack these are the five feet

right yeah okay yes and the corner is

ten feet wide okay does a fourteen hit

so like it would be so this corridor is

like twice so what I did it before when

I should have done and I'll try to do it

next time if I remember is I can just

take the compass the big compass thing

and put us put like out but the center

of the thing over here and go yeah and

then just extend it by 10 feet over and

you get these kind of schools little

semi circles it's not hard to do if you

have the time and the time was a 14-8

yep they are AC

basically Auto it ah worms worms man we

should 11 damage first hit 11 nose let's

call this one number 111 damage and then

and as you cut into this thing and you

hack into its arrows warm body worms go

spilling all over the place and then

eight damage the name were damaged yeah

got it and then I'm gonna duplicate

stick on the same one I mean attack okay

where is my sword I gave it to no on

discord

well that's giving fear blow me it's on

Twitter what you want to do God have to

do everything it's sweet I gave it to

you so you an expert so I wouldn't have

to run it out so you could do it you

said I only have a phone does it seem

like it's been like a millionaire since

we play are you doing a lot more damage

11 more damage done that was copper and

big cat its slim they got a lot of

health sorry we have a lot of help

oh you did you like 30 total or

something I think it's needed exactly 30

brother too which one that's a number

one he's like how many worms are left in

his body uh 36,000 okay never I thought

that might determine how much what's

going Lars I can't find which many read

me oh well it's yeah there's an awful

lot of nonsense around here it's hard to

play right

what I would like to do you can probably

is in there is get right on the other

side of this fellow right here I think I

selling it there yeah yeah that's fine

can I get there yeah cuz it might take

an opportunity attack to that one that

one [ __ ] yeah yeah there yeah yeah

so [ __ ] go on boy yeah I'll say

just shove my way through and I'm gonna

I'm gonna take a SWAT at the at the dude

between me and judge sandwich man I mean

they're sort of like leeches aren't they

whoa leech I you move discuss this after

the fights like I have a head no no

they're just a collection of forms

they're like a colony yeah they were

calling me of worms

still counts as a great day yeah

that's 21 damage

- which one it's not the one it's the

one between judge and as long as you

know which is that was it done number

221 damage yep got it yep all right

second attack my teen hits for this one

I'm going to do a distracting strike so

if I don't drop him

the next person to hit him chop at him

we'll get the bandage okay nineteen

damage on that one another one

yeah same time same guy nineteen okay

that will be it for me for this turn 21

it ten more than me I think you do

exactly same huh all right

yeah Peter 21 and they needed nine more

throws it 1919 okay that's it that's how

the worms look in how many worms left

communicating with the bonds Oh

35 down they fell has a most I mean you

know there is fewer worms

there's four you can definitely tell

like the love you folks have attacked

are smaller hmm they're still trying to

maintain like

they're still trying to maintain a

humanoid shape that was slim now the

phages on various [ __ ] can do yeah

how many other six seven eight I think

there was eight of them a lot yeah oh

yeah how did you see that what a hottie

guy did Santa Cruz

let's start with the one that looks like

it's on King and so it tries to claw at

King with hands made of twisting worms

and it can't gain purchase on Kings

armor and so it stops and it like flexes

an arm and there are no muscles but the

worms move almost like to mimic muscles

and that squeezes and one worm Kang goes

and spits out and go to and lands on

King you have to make a dexterity save I

know I heard you

while so yeah there is a worm law Lars

on Kings face and it's crawling on your

skin and it's trying to burrow under

your skin but it hasn't done yet there's

a page on leech and it tries to it tries

to claw at you and it doesn't manage to

hit you with a claw okay you take

thirteen points of damage

part of it is bludgeoning damage from

the clock and then there's like poison

six thing did you say a total of no

total 13 yeah and then you have to make

a deck same poison now oh yeah it was

poison that just so you know not OD a

deck sighs my mistake yeah a dexterity

check plus save nine you yeah so the the

necro phage like it it's trying to look

like like it like this disease these

worms remember being in these humanoid

creatures and so it's trying to mimic

the things that remembers and it starts

to convulse and then it spits a worm and

the worm goes it starts crawling around

on your face and it starts trying to

burrow its way and you can feel it

biting and pinching trying to get its

way in

that was heals inside yeah find any

entrance when they

and what damage three of them three of

them on him no well actually there could

be four if I wanted to but those three

will attack so that one has advantage he

has a claw attack and he misses his die

so knowing all tonight and then another

claw attack and 17a c-23 I assume hits

judge 18 on it yeah so you take 13

points of damage 7 which is poison there

isn't does poison do something different

there's a condition called poisoned it

does not this does not give you that

condition but poison damage is just like

fire damage or lightning damage so it

can be resisted by certain people it's a

flavor

yeah it's 13 poison damage and judge has

to make it dexterity save yeah

17 oh yeah no judge is fine yeah charge

okay judge [ __ ] so yeah unfortunately

there's two more of these things on you

so two more claw tax 1:18 +6

it's you take another 13 points of

damage second claw attack 16 plus 6 is

22 you take another 13 points of damage

and please pick another dexterity soon

this one

claws at you hurts you and then like it

slaps you it literally slaps judge and

you can feel one of these worms start to

burrow into judges ear no listing around

biting and pinching hasn't it's not it

hasn't burrowed under the skin yet it's

trying back on those both miss and

please but actually can you have you can

have one of these on you can you make

another Dexter you say please 9 yeah

this this one because you've just been

you've just been better so one of these

you can see now when it hits judge it

leaves worms on judges Armour and one of

the worms burrows under judges are and

it's kind of twisting and Hawaii

[Music]

that's say they were not incredibly

dexterous but they're not they're not

dexterous no father has ever done a 20

damage okay so which one do you want

this to be more - I assume number two

hit me I don't know which one's number

two the one that Phil this is a skewed

that's the first one that a - that's the

second so this would be either like so

three of these guys who attacked you the

first who had advantage to the third one

did not which one you're using helical

hell is rebuked on when you damage by

Phil okay so that's the first one 20

damage fire damage yeah it's this one is

uh obviously having a hard time

maintaining its humanoid form okay like

in some cases there's just a small knot

of twisting worms that make up a leg

yeah yeah judge hellishly rebukes this

thing oh by the way you've got a worm

down in your armor that's where I went

I'm one in here right and one in here

here correct one is here that thing's

taking they have 65 health so that was

three of them on judge yeah one of them

will attack big cat why not because yeah

enough curtain and it has even though

the one opposite didn't attack big cat

it is giving this one advantage right so

it gets advantage well it's two o'clock

axe disadvantage first attack this

always displaced this place so the first

attack is just $1 at just correct and

just bandage and then after that you can

attack normally yeah okay so then the

next one till you hit me

Oh until they hit its disadvantage okay

so this one's just Vantage actually 17

plus 6 is 23 like it yes then big cat

takes 13 points of damage of which 7 is

poison and then a big cat also has to

make a saving throw a dexterity

I mean dice good oh that is three three

nights 11 and they're gonna be up inside

so yeah these things claw at big cat and

you can see left behind are is a is a

worm a thick green twisting bulging

saying worm and it starts to crawl and

it disappears under big cats firm and

you can see moving moving in big cats

fur as the seeking creature trying to

anyway let's see that was that was one

on leech one on king that one attacked

big cat those three attacked judge

there's one on Bubba boots and he's got

advantage with the other one the other

one sock attack was his pocket a king

slim but that one's gonna attack boots

with advantage on the first claw 16 plus

6 is 22

second one so close nineteen that hits

so you take 26 points of damage

wow this guy's hit hard

it's a d6 + 3 + 2 D 6 so it's 3 d6 + 3

that's yeah and you have to make a

dexter you save which i sort of presume

you're gonna make because your boots

there you're definitely gonna make it

you piece of [ __ ] oh my god I thought

for a second I was like I don't I

literally thought to myself I don't

think I see your paws gonna make it

that's not whamming that's like the

opposite of Aram I got a whammy him

you're definitely animation if Matt ever

uses these again bamps

says you should get a bag of gummy worms

I agree that's a good idea

I wish I thought I had so yes yeah

you've got a worm on you - I could do

the whole horrible description thing a

wing yeah but I feel like so then the

other ones gonna attack slim just a

regular just a regular cute I just roll

two tents are they both miss and you

have to make a dexterity safely's I

think it X a bone a mystery packs a claw

claw I got it's not it's not claw claw

and if one hits a worm its o'clock you

got one I got a worm yep slim definitely

has a worm so did everybody except

copper get a worm mm-hmm man I gotta

used X days I guess you guys more often

all right so yeah you everybody except

copper has worms crawling on them trying

to get into their skin you can on your

turn you can either expand your action

getting rid of a worm or you can just

ignore it and presume that it'll be fine

everything's fine

we're all fine down here are you just

attack as normal boots evils up inside

yet many entries when they can let's see

I

protons your master so removing a worm

is an action correct one more correct

wonder if you have to that's then you

got a waiter than your own then then

you're probably good you're like

somebody else could spend their action

trying to get a warm off you all right

who has two I'm gonna get my worm off of

me yeah all right I mean is there gonna

put a worm on you every round

claw claw or so well you you'll be I'll

toss the word Ice King

okay your key word would you hurt it's

just an action it's just like I just

yeah well you can either like scrape it

off with this what that was described as

you can scrape it off with a knife or

you can try to burn it off oh yeah I

probably just take I mean I'm you know I

went to college for this so I'm

dexterous enough with the sword that I

could just sort of like shave it off

sure yeah my skin without harming myself

I'm still there like a tick gross I'm

gonna say gross which is a human word

leech you've got you've got a leech on

you I'll make things go first I don't

have him pluck the worm off my head okay

that's a really takes yeah yeah yeah and

then I'm gonna turn well I'm on that

[ __ ] it just warmed me and I'm gonna

cast blight the lights are pretty

powerful spell yeah well I've had enough

of it like worms so you have to make you

make a save right yep Tom yeah

Constitution Constitution pretty cool

success and they get a huge bonus 24:24

harvest okay that's true that's like the

eighth

the average 725 which one is this things

are incredibly I mean he'll Eli yeah

that's a bonus action how many can I do

for these six alright here we go huh

I'm gonna use my bonus section to use my

healing light on Anna or judge I should

say there we go

13 14 plus that is 19 Pitt points back

for you let's I am stunning judge I mean

I useful there's a worm crawling in your

ear and there's a worm burrowing

underneath your breast plate I'm gonna

use my action to dig the worm out of my

ear and then I'm gonna use my bonus

action to cast shield of faith in myself

Inc myself plus 2 AC King there's a worm

crawling on your face your face worms so

if I'm wrong you said that we could burn

them off sure yeah it's still actually

just if I were to cast fire shield on

myself when they're trying to burrow

into me they're gonna

[ __ ] blastin house fire shield work uh

so I only get the fire version only read

the actual spell versus the clip it's

yeah read the spawn please like a thin

wispy flame reads your body for the

duration shredding bright light and a

10-foot radius and dim light for an

additional ten feet you can end the

spell blah blah blah the flame provides

you with the warm shield thorn should

hold grants resistance to cold damage in

addition whenever a creature within 555

feet of you hits you with a melee attack

the shield erupts in flame the attacker

takes to d8 fire damage I am going to

rule that the worm has already already

on you so it's not gonna trigger the

final shoot yes it's already it's

already it's already done this so the

fire shields not gonna fire it's just

gonna go yes but that would mean future

ones will probably burn at least are you

casting fire shell are we gonna scrape

off the worm ah eels he was I mean he's

just gonna attack me again and put it

back on so we're gonna be on this

infinite cycle so well you can deck

sight be on the worm cycle sure I could

get the next worm road it's all definite

fill go ahead and make an attack okay

I'll attack that once between me and

[Music]

yeah five and seven is still over ten oh

yeah it was a room in the hallway to the

IMAX theater that's 13 damage to number

213 damage to number two still alive

damn [ __ ] seven

that was the Hobson Shah all right yeah

are you gonna you're gonna go see your

on the hook you said well decide that

you're gonna go see the lighthouse [ __ ]

you that didn't you didn't you in the

discord say that you're gonna go through

the lighthouse was I think you did I did

you finish watching the lighthouse

trailer you could not get through the

movie and I wanted to use the captive

audience actually pretty cool

yeah whose side are you on the warm side

your leech leeches are like worms

because if you're on the warm side then

I get advantage why the baguette

well no I usually morning that's

disappoint by just spill your worms

sorry do you run away yeah he ran down

the route he he beats feet and run runs

down more I'm about to fireball this

whole room there's a big room behind us

yeah qinger you know yeah there's more

copper it's your turn you do not have a

worm on you but they do see

this this distortion in big cats fur as

though there's a worm trying to

penetrate his hide display digging into

his yes please just a big big flea all

right got a hunter's mark number one and

20 so that one man there there's a

shitload of these things they have a lot

of the points so seven no I wish it

would I will you need to cast on

something it's gonna fail it's a there's

no way of even though these things like

super super constitutional 15 damage

more tech well because because they're a

little individual creatures it's not

like they have one heart that you can

mmm 10 damage you catching up to a feels

damage I'll never tell oh yeah I

represent you only done 55 damage to it

yeah Phil did 73 damage to his it is a

competition I got it okay big cat will

we can't can attack Herbie can't confuse

its use its tentacles to scrape off a

worm yeah speaking of using the

chemicals what would you do Vincent's a

[ __ ] kill that thing you seen himself

after I'll take the worm off okay yeah

you see a big copper copper commands a

big catch to groom itself and big cat

uses the the hook claws on the insides

of its tentacle pads to just and you see

like ripped worm come off it

and that's how you don't assume you've

got a womb on you don't worm on me it's

burrowing and trying to burrow into your

green gift skin

[ __ ] I'm attacking Katie Katie

Oh dick a decade um so let's attack the

I'm going to just keep hammering on that

one okay it's just it's it's almost it's

almost disintegrated into like a pile of

worms it can't make it before me more

you've done so much damn it and I'm a 13

damaged it's dead alright yeah I just

spill your worms yeah I know you see

they just collapses and each little worm

now that you've done this it starts to

shrivel up and turn into a tiny little

mote that just turns into dust and

washes away all right it's gone from

ring well to ring worm very right so I

want to use before I do anything I want

to use my movement and move one step

closer to judge so that nothing can

scoot in there and get it managed and

then I'm gonna take a swing at that that

guy that was next next to me that guy I

don't know what number he is I don't

hasn't been touch which is like when am

i fire ball anybody but leach fire ball

everybody is copper so [ __ ] yourself so

boots leach judge and King all got their

correct but Judge saw the world on which

one they line the air one in the element

you spell that

okay so

[Music]

so these things are not undead they are

not undead no I'm gonna try using my

right there are magical they're a

magical infection I'm gonna try using my

menacing attack on them okay see if

there they can be a minister they yeah

they can be menaced exactly - okay

so sixteen damage okay this is a new one

we'll call this one number four uh-huh

and it needs to make a wisdom saving

through it fails okay so if it can be

frightened it is friend it can be

frightened it is frightened

yeah you see you see when you use your

menacing attack like what does it look

like when slim I mean I'm sure he just

you know lets out sort of some kind of

barbaric barbaric you know you know yeah

bares his fangs and you see the worms

that make up this humanoid form like

ripple and shudder and like a wave

mm-hmm so it's definitely had an effect

okay I don't know okay I'm going to use

my action surge and I am going to let's

see so that guy is a feared can i I

circle around I've only used 1 1 square

movement here can I get there yeah

there's a wall there yeah the skeletons

backed up against the wall right well is

there any reason you can't move

diagonally yeah and it's not clear to me

what are all those guys backed up

against the skeletons are that's the

reason wall oh so that's not a space

all right then okay uh do I just scare

your worm sorry many of us have watched

that lighthouse trailer at several times

I'll step forward into that empty space

so that I can attack the one next to be

cat yeah it's two minutes don't see

we're gonna find out what these things

do if you don't scrape the line that's a

hit yeah I'm gonna try to menace this

[ __ ] as well so this is another one

right yes this is number five yes saving

through wisdom saving through I'm sorry

distracted mini what did I rolled up at

20

that's a reroll it's another 20 no 12

oh yeah wisdom No okay so 21 damage to

that next one yeah this is number five

[Laughter]

it's just yeah anyway and I don't think

I can get to any other guys to do my

last attack javelin them or whatever you

got mmm-hmm well I mean like it just hit

the guy in front of me I'll just hit the

one that I had before that's friend well

is that not on fear I'm break it doesn't

if you hit somebody who's frightened and

it gets rid of the frightening be in

your beard enough I don't think so

what hitting hitting a frightened

critter doesn't stop the frightened no

no there are certain spells yeah I think

that's how fear works their fears bail

might work that way but no unless unless

your effect explicitly says that that is

not a property of the fear I'd be kind

of dumb for a fighter if they fear him

and then uh so 14 damage to Novi 14 yeah

and I'm done and I didn't scrape the

worm off let's see oh you feel this bike

this and you take you take one point of

time but that's it you're fine

oh yeah and they you folks see the worm

kind of goes like on this digging run

and slim circles and it goes in and it

leaves this hole and that's like it

looks almost like an eruption like

there's like swollen inflamed skin and

this dark black hole that leads into

Slim's body under my skin no it's in

your body now correct and now now I

taking an action will not take it out so

now you've got this you've got this

disease inside you eels can you describe

this they're still alive so we'll have

plenty of opportunities for people to

get it I mean there's a reason this

thing was locked up and very well all

right really it's incredibly infectious

and lethal their turn two of them were

frightened four four and five so that

was yeah slim so now it's these monkey

people and there they have to run away

from me oh yeah so they're out of the

comment for now and what we call Italy

Oh [ __ ] out of here claw claw 18 okay

that two claws hit both closet 21 and 23

and you take 13 points of

image and then another 13 points of

damage and you have to make it X 30 and

you are the best friends forever so I

assume you're gonna make it easy

notice I didn't worry him you know it's

only weird hey present yourself such a

nice guy wait and I can't say the rest

of the words on stream so yeah you know

you now have a worm crawling on your

skin you can spend an action on your

turn

scrape it off can I eat it you could eat

it yeah uh-oh T thinks they're delicious

so he's like running I like picking up

all these little worms and he thinks

their eyes he picking them off of us

well because he wants to he's hoping

that you'll just turn into another worm

creature and they'll be more warmus for

him so leech you've got one of them on

you know I'm actually they picked elf

know you've got a Scranton guys on you

know I saw it actually this one those

two are feared oh they're both feared

yeah okay

so yeah that means they are not going to

attack correct correct their time moving

away I think that works well frightened

no it just says they can't move closer

and they have disadvantage on ability

type attacks while the source of their

field was in life I thought they're

basically oh yeah that's right unless

unless Phil's so there's the frightened

condition but then there are there's a

spell called fear that that is like

frightened puff-puffs right right right

so unless Phil's ability says something

funky all this means is it has

disadvantage on attack roles while it

can see Phil and it cannot willingly

move closer to fat it yeah so now this

was like yes slim get some talk about

tuning on that guy as he and the way

these things move as their legs as they

try to walk actually what happens is

like parts of their body just

disintegrates in the pile of worms and

then reform into a humanoid shape so

it's not actually lifting legs up and

moving it's almost like this treadmill

of worms that occasionally turn into

humanoid so 9 on that one 9.5

whatever one that was

and then so this one who was

disadvantaged because of fear now was

just a regular die roll because he's

flanking and that's so what's your armor

Class six thing that's a hit you're

actually quite easy to hit compared to

all these other [ __ ] it's two

there's two hits and so you take 26

points of damage

all right damn I say give me that look

just give you a look and you have to

make your next 30 so that sees plus 14

for me yeah just Doral [ __ ] [ __ ] my side

by 6 there's a warm on you mm-hmm uh-huh

13 toss the right next to me there's

nothing oh and then the other one

attacks and he has actual advantage this

time yeah great

a 5 and a 2 ah don't help now I guess

another one yep those hits mm-hmm and

you had another make another signal

please 13 points and amateur noticing

what's that 15 Oh what did you say

damaging poison damage I'm down leech

goes down yeah Oh same be said and now

leech has two worms on him uh as leech

cannot save Oh bollocks have rhodol rise

well going in two worms out on bit but

what I want to be on me if I'm down

right little gulfs Oh No now they're

gonna turn you into one of them do I get

thee yeah actually I thought me is it no

correct yeah actually no I think that

didn't OD does OD go away we want

conscious spells spells stop working

when you go unconscious guess not when

you die thanks guys so he goes away

let's see that is one two three of these

things one of them is on slim does not

have any kind of advantage that guy's

feared oh that's right that guy's fear

yeah so he has disadvantage yeah 13:09

miss it was a 16 and a 9

that's a miss

and on down yet and then you're gonna

make another deck safe this is how li

chen's

you're gonna get you at some point I

gotta have the worm I guess knock on pad

got a nine yep two worms baby

mmm that's good that's good yeah that's

bad yeah reposition let's see there's

one on big catch it was not doesn't

advantage or anything you wrote afore

gonna achieve 220 I assume that hits big

cat oh that's right I said sorry is

disadvantage so that one I'll just roll

another one and that one misses so he

hasn't hit you yet how much life did

they have till like 7:00 right quad I

mean three of them are medium damaged

one of them's dead and the rest are

fresh

so now caught so now big cat has another

one money actually can't as to make a

saving throw

okay how much health you have leaves no

what's your max health having 50 tooling

yeah 52 oh I see I can't and action

there's one on boots and one on judge

what on boots protects your take cuz

another 13 points of damage boots please

make a semi truck saving throws like a

70 or something like that yeah okay so

yeah you just take Spanish and you qua

you dodge out of the way over the warm

your unone is a judge judge is a giant

worm creature that's trying to burrow

its way into your skin

ten misses a three misses please make a

second row that's the 1313 makes it you

would not you dodge the you dodge that

worm they still have one where I'm under

you yes and that's the end of the Burrow

the worm that did not get what dog no oh

yeah judge had two worms on him before

Jones spent a turn taking a worm off so

you take one more point of damage on the

ending last turn from a worm burrowing

into you so that one point in Amager

represents the worm that was i going to

be a breastplate queen now I stand then

there's a worm inside you will find out

that inside yeah so yeah there's like a

multiple-stage thing you have to feel

you're saving throw and then not not

spending action before have more less

than one worm on you Booth's so yeah you

have no warm on your boots leeches down

away I'm going to three of these things

are fresh and and no one is a hungry

hungry

I'm gonna use my disengage action here

and on my way past each I say from from

what anywhere it's on an action it's a

poem section 3d fool yep last four five

six seven eight twelve that was boots

leach you have two worms on him fire and

you are actually still prone to wounds

can only take two off OD yeah he's gone

oh [ __ ] of course he's gone well

I'm not like well just get out of there

dude yeah you need yeah oh this guy

I mean hip Boise all right now Josh me

I've got 40 40 hit points out of how

many out of 61 okay

I'm disengaging and going well right

next to King here okay so you spend your

action to convert your movement into

movement that doesn't provoke yes so you

take two points of damage

yep and you have two worms in you and

they yeah crawling under your skin you

can see those you look at leech you can

see under the skin these lumps twisting

and moving under the skin mmm

don't worry doctor if anything happens I

can perform some surgery of my own once

again sir judge I went to college

alright is there anything I could do

about the worm in me right now mm-hmm

you'd be surprised how often I've been a

sec I don't know what can what can you

do

mmm it can't be dug out that's really

yeah like you couldn't take a knife and

like cut no it's gone it's inside you we

need a paladin hmm let's get occu Mitsu

to microwave it out right please man

edge Phil you got a magic resist right

how healthier you are you done judge

more than half

how much is half 63 out of one okay so

63 out of 81 we're all fine here yeah

okay you want eight eight ferocity they

won't work on do you want to eat for us

I guess I'm annoying you guys yeah at

the end of your turn you feel this like

like like the creature the worm writhing

inside you is starting to drain your

life essence said you take 12 points of

damage you jammy Chagas take 12 points

of damage and you have this overwhelming

sensation that that the problem that is

your skin and that if you could just you

know this this intense painful hunger

that could only be sated by peeling up

and eating your own skin oh you're

certain Otto phage and you know as you

realize that you suddenly saw that room

a little bit but the the leathery

Yanni's that were in there you could see

there were stripes missing from their

skin like somebody maybe even they had

taken knives and daggers and swords and

carved off and eating their own flesh so

take 12 points of damage but that's from

the word

it's from the worm inside you and every

chapter me trying to eat myself

you can try to yourself if you want to

it's on your own everything that was the

end of judges turn it's King King as far

as I know you don't have a worm on you

and you haven't gotten worm since then

no congratulations now your worm free

worm free is the way to be and 10-10-10

elf no fair ten elf I'm good that's yes

do not like yeah I mean I gotta make it

I'll see what I can show

I have so it is a dexterity saving throw

big cats probably good for that Oh No

but as I have a lot of health 27 out of

85 so oh then no you're fine oh also I

take half damage because I avoidance

okay cool yeah so go ahead and everybody

up here

Oh God like a deck save BC 15 well these

things are not very dexterous so maybe

big how many how many of these creatures

are you affecting not that one I think

so surely your hand didn't cover now

only foot radius so that's four squares

away from the one two three four all

right go ahead and point to which one to

a a Otto phage number four and what's

that I'm sorry you said the dc-dc 1548

points of damage or half unsaid and this

is Dex this is a deck safe so he fails

or these points fired and there's no

before or that was number four

48 48 is dead one down number five

yeah he's disadvantaged on this safe too

because uh right this one number five

mm-hmm I think yeah yes disadvantage on

ability checks and the tag rolls no oh

there are three kinds of rules ability

to check the tag world series was and he

made his safe how much damage do you

think a 24 that's number five yeah it

still [ __ ] some okay that's that's yeah

he already had 30 points in damage

okay next number three number three has

taken a little damage yeah he fails ok

48 points of damage

48 Wow no yeah oh they have gate yeah

that's yeah that's good yeah that's

that's a lot this is some cauterizing

you've learned a lot about yeah this is

yeah yeah I think at this point the next

board don't have numbers so you can just

roll home six yeah this guy's six he

makes the save he takes 24 24 there's a

number ones up there number seven

second thing I had no number-7 fails is

save and 448 that guy fails it fails is

save 448 number one wait who's eight

eight eight is that one yeah yeah number

one thirteen plus nothing was a DC 48

number one and of course all y'all

[ __ ] have to also saver to f it

only big ok yeah yeah but I still take

half even though I feel yeah this is

definitely you know this is the this is

the nuclear option right yeah that was

incredibly effective I think there's

anybody in chat giving large [ __ ] for

doing this this is a gross one I would

have done yeah so you guys can clean

this up and I leave my copper

specifically I think whenever this

happens like you just see this like

weightless fire right because I'm work

right in front of it oh yeah yeah right

in the front judge you just see judge

like washed in this like fire and flame

and then he's just like cheering on like

his like maniacally you hear you hear

this voice to your left it sounds like

judge going i taste delicious that

doesn't happen

that's not canonical wow great reagan

says i think everybody in shat was

waiting for lars to do this from the

beginning yeah yeah you get from orbit

it's going to be sure

listen there's a substantial dollar

value attached to this cuts are from the

same movie they can bill me we're

getting a movie night things set up and

definitely aliens so that was king it's

copper and mica um do you don't have big

cats got a worm inside yeah guys no one

crawling on him that's yeah how much

health you we do this again 39

can i is there if I hold keep in mind if

I finish this what that is magic

resistance would you think it's saved

there's I could stare fill that role

like I wonder if that's true I mean

listen to max up the damage like number

five and six book what I'm thinking is

if I hold it's that a thing which is

urgent and then wait for you to go and

then I go after you like how many are

left out there you can do that for five

five five Jesus badly for him to move

out yes if slim if you move and then

then I go next then I do another

fireball kind of okay 30 foot radius

like you're gonna need to get yeah right

so one oh you're trying you pull you

know of your fire anymore yeah dude oh

that's right it's the Rockets the stone

excavation the excavation we move to

okay silly way now it's what route 86

Friday 20-foot sphere already oh you

have to roll for yours but loves get set

damage I use my channel divinity okay I

basically channellock you Mitsuda

demands

I guess you some yeah I can only I can I

can do it no I guess you could move the

tractor moves

well I sure yeah sure rest of it is no I

cast it one more time mommy disengage

Swamy hung wrist you know I make long

rest for spell slots yeah y'all mean

Swamy and then wait and then hold your

bow first yeah move and then you fire it

yeah it's true so [ __ ] lazy Swamy

yeah that's why me okay so I move back

Holden I never really use hold me action

so I can just say like I'm not gonna

attack and then wait so I mean I just

know the rules in fifth edition but I

know the rules on another addition which

is that you can give up your entire turn

and basically say I'm gonna

later okay right or you can use your

action to create a trigger where it's

like yeah I'm gonna prepare so if

something happens later so if you just

want to wait and go after somebody that

has just don't do anything right now

okay

about otherwise you can use your action

to create a trigger okay I think I

should just wait for Sloan to go then

yeah and then I go I mean I don't know

what what what you would do but well my

whole terribly he could he doesn't even

have to worry about yeah he could go

this way as you try to get out of your

range if we do the math of it so yeah if

it's one get there three four well we're

saying you could move this way I'd be

out of it too that's a good point okay

why wouldn't he just come to my house

yeah but that guy that guy's for

district

you can't come any closer today yeah

okay I'll do that and wait for slim then

what's he doing is he like he's like

nothing is doing that like like yeah

he's my kitty cat

he's my Squishy cat anyway anyway yeah

I'm gonna hold my yeah are you gonna

like I can't move yet

I'll move because I hold my act hold my

here we go after slim yeah yeah this guy

gonna be in the blast yeah yeah I mean

there's the other option is I don't I am

the fire ball over here so you that you

can't say yeah well I mean I don't want

to just like stand there with my thumb

up my ass right you can I mean you'd

never make it right yeah I can make it

there yeah alright do it

that guy can take an opportunity attack

but he's got disadvantage because he's

afraid of me did you just engage Rinna

no no opportunity

Oh Jack I also saved lost I was five and

eight so I don't miss all right I'm

gonna just it's like an attack that

chumpy okay where is that guy seven that

is that's a hit I'm gonna second oldest

moment all right you know this is a

desperate but desperate moment I'm going

to use my last period he died to try -

this [ __ ] man you seize on your

attorney very big can't come back - yeah

Gemma get her out of the way

ya can't get some opportunity attacks

but uh nineteen damaged and he needs to

make a saving throw which one is this

number 619 so that's no good

yes friend they don't my second little

tack on that guy it's it's a wall yes

yeah number six got it all right that

was slim your head thomassie so oh yeah

we spotted so I'm not sure what the

rolling is on it so big cat can move or

attack um would attack include like

disengage or do you think she even has

the concept of disengage or you know

those those other actionless no I don't

think I don't think like big cat is a

smart enough creature to understand the

idea of how to move but without

provoking tax for opportunity okay like

that requires a degree of tactical

understanding that animals don't have

videos no I guess I get three dang

that's a lot but three entire balls are

we need these guys frightened this one

is one of them yeah okay so that taco

yeah sixes - yeah

so there's oh there's only display

there's only disadvantage there's not

double disadvantage this is my how many

times these packages right I think a

couple really feared doesn't to the oh

sure yeah so which what's coppers what's

what's big cats are class 13 okay so

this first one with disadvantage its

take 13 points in damage

now does that cause a displacement to go

away for everybody or just that guy for

everybody okay so now this person is

this person feared yeah is there how

many who Ivan six are yeah here done do

they both get attack swap yeah okay so

this one just manage enrolled so if

there's a 16 hit yeah okay so it's

another 13 points in damage that's what

this advantage and then the last one

goes you get a lot of ferocity that's a

one it's a critical failure I mean I

heard him so that's yes so it's six more

I guess things more ferocity dice and

they can how you still have that new

menu of ferocity stuff right yep yeah oh

yeah

you've improved I've improved the

displacer base oh so you need to step

back right with here yeah I guess

they'll step back as my bonus not take

it and then I will fireball remember if

you there's a if you yeah so it's the

you have to issue you pick a target you

should do uh huh it's the farmers own

okay person you shoot up that's the

that's the that's the center of the be

seven yes you can't make it the ground

but then you automatically rolled to see

if they are breaks guitars yeah you

didn't that's a yes okay okay all right

886 I looked at it but I forgot right

there it's 86 yeah it's gonna be enough

my dice 1 and I went in on some of that

action

anyone's to just one one was it mine

that was nice and even 30 damage nice

three-inch so they ought to make seven

throws again correct yeah all five of

them yes yeah okay so the first one

which I'm is number three has to make a

senator was should DC copper yes I

assume it's my field number three I had

he's dead number five succeeds how much

damage four-and-a-half 15 15 15 okay got

it

so yes - number five still alive but

this now a very tiny pile of worms

number six that's Rock die that's a

failure he's dead yeah yeah number seven

oh the deck save I assume 11 is not high

enough

No 12 is the 7 is dead yeah oh yeah 3030

only by like two points damage points

okay and this one succeeds 18 what's

your so half of 1515 damage that's right

quite tough in there yeah they're

they're really hard to kill yeah I mean

there's nothing you guys find in ring

well is going to be easy

yeah they don't lock things up here that

could be easily taken to live a number

and fine I think is still frightened

yeah so you can't come closer

yeah well I have an 8 5 minute

Stane she just stand back there I can

take it

that was copper and now they go so yeah

that one's gonna walk up to the judge

and the other one's gonna walk up to the

can this one can't walk towards slim

he'll walk up to judge you can't

willingly move closer to the source of

his fear it'll go back into the room oh

do I buzz in the door shut no no I

thought we shut the door did you shut

the door yeah the other door casually

strolling back now we'll walk up to one

two three four five six you can reach

bring it slim AC 20 yeah it's so one of

them hits you take thirteen more points

of damage please make a saving throw

nine you've got no more so you've got a

worm in you and now you have to work on

you coming the worms all right that was

or them that was the Otto phage and now

it's boots works does not have a warm on

him uh yeah can you move me up in

between judging slim I will attack my

back the dens ax right in there that's a

hit attack again that's a hit right tech

in this the first time you're gonna

throw attack off your that's a hit I

think this is the second time let's go

maybe the third but how'd you get it

though

if the first to hit the Z I do be be

it's a very detailed like anatomically

correct

so that

and I'm also gonna use I'm gonna use

this not moved it right I'm gonna use

this mobile thingy so the last one is an

extra yeah extra emphatically Jing

attack it will knock him back yeah after

I saw as I imagine like a horror movie

or something

48 damage someone yell which was us

that's number he's back there making way

who boots but did you bring breath back

down here with you have you had butts

come down to inspect the door you

couldn't get through but other than that

I don't think she's she's off in the

corner me retainers retainers ours Jenna

when you're like playing by yourself you

can have your buddies go with you and

buff your encounter strength guild well

party of people taking all their

retainers with them that was boots it's

leech you have to worms on you mmm-hmm

turn I was unconscious

landed on me when I was unconscious yeah

you had one on you and then one landed

on you while you were unconscious

yeah and haven't is this the firt that

and then you took a turn and went over

there so you take two more points of

damage thank and you get two worms

inside you actually yeah I think I

described I think you already taking

that damage because I think I okay great

so now you take two DS six points of

damage were this is probably taking me

down again per wormhole

[ __ ] to d6 per warm he had strange

5-10-15 19 points of damage before you

pass out

you're pretty certain that you can fix

all this if you could just you just

consume your flesh just that'll fix it

again

bleach drops don't judge you feel you

feel annoying inside would you plan to

me not to be unconscious yeah you feel

something inside you churning those

biting pain in your now there's that one

guy up by the door yeah don't mess

around

to take your turn by the way as chat

just pointed out oh yeah were the worms

die Jeff the one you're still alive what

do you lined up but you're about to

you're about to take 19 points of damage

right you have this vision you have this

vision of a theater you realize you've

seen what happens to people with this

disease you can't cure disease wait you

can't cure disease no I don't have cure

I can't kill a soldier gets cure disease

wiki's all di+ full the way paladin's do

it is they know she inflicts a judge and

afflicts exhaustion's

yeah exhausted how's the over here play

chess going like 300 [ __ ] things well

we only need like five people so when

she gets five

stop well that's not how we do so yield

yourself yeah yeah wait all of you died

from worms yeah you got a bunch back and

then you lost it all again right I added

Q like that cough q wounds on myself so

that's my action there's no putting move

in

anyone else need some help you oh now

you're not getting healed I wouldn't

kick some health out of bed you wouldn't

leave okay [ __ ] stealing my healing

light on young as it was I don't like I

don't like eating before I run Dean D

because I feel like you know and then

you take 19 points now and then I take

90 boys but you're still up

I am still up yeah thanks jack I have no

more hating life so judge you do feel as

though light so maybe if you could if

you had some ability to unfuck yourself

yeah I do which is what lesser

restoration Wow

what does Lester Esther it was less a

restauranteur Lester Lester Lester comes

back Thank You creature and can end

either one disease or one condition of

watching it the condition can be blinded

deafened paralyzed or poisoned like an

hour canna check or like a religion

check find out what the hell this thing

is so you don't know if it's gonna work

we can try it I made a couple things I'm

trying to try this one first okay I'm

gonna try it like a lesser restoration

on myself

okay mark off the spell mom culpas felt

less he's classic yeah judge

channel's the infernal power of Asmodeus

and you feel you feel the worms inside

you wither an eye

and now you have some warm corpses you

no longer have ones in you but you've

bet you've dewormed yourself instead of

BlueCross BlueShield it's not red stripe

black shield oh that guy DC 15 was save

your old 60 all right great

he has my studio isn't he fails all

right

eight damage to the only one that's left

and that kills him all right you have

destroyed the last remaining has a

warrant on him and two worms in him yep

big cat has a worm in him I had to take

that one it's on me huh yeah yeah that's

no problem but thank you I've got two in

me right uh-huh

do you have less frustration we're gonna

I'm sorry we're not to stay you you

haven't done that yet cuz we're gonna

stay in combat because at the end of

your turn if you got worms and you take

damage and so King is your turn huh yeah

I did a contra okay so I moved on

everything else so now I'm gonna spend

an action you can take that worm off

yeah and the only thing else I don't I

can't really do anything else

can I have my mage hand these things out

of me 13 points and you definitely hear

certain you're certain that gift flesh

is the Cure that if only you could peel

off your own muscle and digest it it

would make all the pain go away copper

okay so I not sure I think yeah we've i

got a worm in big guys worm do you have

a word wait yeah you do have a worm yeah

and then I and then I spent a turn using

my fireball so then it burrowed I so you

take a pointy damage from the Burrow oh

yeah 20 now sorry I didn't write down

the other worm I've been using your

cards to write down who has the world I

remember saying that hey so this is the

longest we've played a lot of break we

don't take a break at 8:30 it's or what

maybe could well know it's those were

that we might but we'll stop though yeah

it will stop the stream so I think I'm

gonna do recovery for big cat to heal

okay your team monster spins prosody an

equal number of hit ice feel that much

so yeah you spend as much ferocity as

you want I think it gets you burn your

dad ice to heal yourself so I think

maybe let's take a short rest like

instantly dig deep I think I'm so says

hit dice or hit points 8510 d-10 play

yeah so I think I have 10 yep it's like

a tenth level creature that was a

detailer time okay so I'm gonna do every

hit now you spend right now cost you 1/4

oz be okay in some tents oh yeah I'll do

I can't do y'all do for what's a

restoration was what cure diseases

well cure diseases cured diseases cures

disease - I don't think that's the spell

it is well is it I don't think it is I

think it is less restoration okay well

those like why can I detect it but I've

never gotten cure disease but I've cure

poison maybe there's not it says

targeted by effect that cures disease or

something else so I'm not gonna tell you

makes all the worms really and then for

me I will do another healing spirit i'll

cast it right on top of me so i can make

the one healed all right

[Music]

so I get three hills back Leach

you didn't go down from the worm damage

did you know I because you healed

yourself I heal myself yeah mm-hmm time

out cures diseases not a spell bites off

thank you thank yous guys okay copper

takes ten points of damage from the

warming item the phages the autophagy is

dead

boots give anything you want to do you

know the warming you geez mommy I can I

can tell that something is causing some

discomfort to my comrades what why I put

it I mean I can I can give I can give

people some HP but I think that's about

all I can do yeah who's who's hurtin my

own car 18 yeah we thirty leach is the

one who's most endangered 13 mmm I have

ten health left [ __ ]

right but leech goes next and two two

helos go but to go after that right all

right leech yes sir let me play you

[Music]

humans was like mending I don't know so

actually lesser restoration restricts is

a lot of stuff not just disease it'll it

will fix ability drain actually less

restoration it's got the classic way to

fix abilities points have been reduced

primarily because we've been fighting a

wraith or whatever it I don't want to

wait for a long rest less restoration

well each it's my god yes right now yep

I'm certain your

huh I'm Ivan I'm proficient in surgery

medicine I've got a scout medicine the

ship's doctor a while yeah thought of

how to get these things out of me

first is what I do sir did you hear

yourself

I know he here will mean first I can't

cure wounds again and I'm out I'm out

for my healing I'm out I was supposed to

outside and healing light bring back od

and send him inside I'm a specialist

I've got ritual with a spell stop doing

immediately otherwise it has to be a

rich 10 minutes guess all I'm yes you

can however you have to make a medicine

check okay which is that a skill yes

yeah

now you have to make a medicine check

and you will automatically do addy ten

points of damage to yourself mm-hmm

yeah I can cut need to get him out it if

you make your check okay if I make it

yeah actually you can only get one more

mouth though when you have two worms in

you ones bad and none okay go ahead make

a mess and check actually wait a minute

if it's two days six per worm is it on

early ten points damage if he's not it's

not ten points it's a d-10 oh it could

be it could be one I think you succeed

you are able to slice in through the

meat between your ribs and go into right

next to your heart yes and stab one of

the two worms but that that degree of

auto surgery inflicts eight points of

damage on you is there anything else you

want to do on your turn no those are

actually that's more action there's no

plane anywhere I'd rather be near you

are you done I've done the last wormans

on you buckle

up the tab of who's online it's just a

cutesy copper's goblin face yes it's now

almost 10 o'clock and I'm ready to go to

pinks so yeah you get a lot of range

Allah saying hey that college kid wants

to talk to you where does he want to

meet the dancing in store yeah we can't

rest on the candle shop and then yeah

okay I mean are we gonna check the room

before we leave the cauldron sounds oh

yeah so short rests and Odeon and yeah

he's like no I saw some I want to run

after now we shot a do it anyway

yes we do we don't know if those cool

C's have come along with some [ __ ] so

short rest because you want help

oh oh there's no H in that word you need

to be full of uh we're gonna send OD

through the crack if she comes through

the crack I'm gonna do a spell on

fireball at it yeah yeah I'll coffee

back is original so we let's get a view

on what that is and then wall yeah ten

minutes and I'll play song of healing so

song of rest we all doing a short rest

up that I know we make slim to get this

stuff back yeah if you if you use hit

dies you get an extra one d6 Wow nice is

anybody else still barillo big cat but

I'm gonna do hit die since you have

myself oh I'll do one da plus four on it

well you hate Plus for sure

oh yeah well we're what we're resting to

commander I'm giving him the rock

all right as long as someone's tuning do

this thing for each are you only with

are you going to attune to the rod of

camerado von glower I I would be

delighted to come on why are we letting

we just do it he's my man senior officer

the surgeon I made yeah he's a

spellcaster

he's a drow it's a vampire rod exile

sword wielding judge um what is it Wendy

eight plus sport if you up cast it you

get one t-84 spell Oh Bob Costas a but

Castiel of a one to one date Wow I just

rolled exactly up to my max HP yeah

awesome

it's fate that guarantees if nothing bad

will happen to you in the next one maybe

something did you cost anything as well

do we get anything extra rest if you use

a I used to oh you get you could get one

extra d6 of HP one inch of these things

okay I know it's just right as long as

you use one what if you use for you so

just hit one it's just like yeah if you

yeah it's not hurt because just regain

an extra one d6

that's [ __ ] if you know so you know

my thinking rather only has the cast on

a certain really is Aldrich blast so I

might as well give them more options

yeah so I'm down I do

good let's go be back to fully six that

not gonna give it to a tea leaf I've got

the tea leaf you had okie stinky

yep now you know the judge cast identify

on this right yes and that

its power is greater than the power of

his spell so that even judge does not

know everything about this only only his

vague details I can use it you know you

know that well I mean that's fine now

right and you who according to The

Chronicle who count von glower was

vampire right maybe based on what your

in The Chronicle it sounds like a lady

serial type character okay is your

patron okay with you attorney too

clearly evil I don't know how my patron

is do you know how to attune to it

i I do know okay anyway you shove it up

your ass you'll not sleep for four hours

you're gonna spend time with it I don't

know exactly what it entails but if

you're like study and stuff like good

point yeah so out of that okay so you

guys take the short rest which is an

hour yeah sure rest up Tanya yeah so

during that short rest what are you

gonna do to try to attune to this thing

is there anything on it I think I'll

come read on it there's a it's red it's

black and gold a pattern on it and

there's a hawk stylized hawk on the

carved into the top of its black lacquer

there's smooth very heavy it's got a lot

of heft to it mm-hmm

no no because when I tuned to the other

one it just happened this one's

different

yes yes yes nothing's happening yeah I

used to have this rock mm-hmm well ever

think about it

hey let me see maybe there's a trick to

it it's my button on it somewhere I sure

did it no this appears to be a solid

piece of some heavy wood mmm maybe scum

not evil I mean

get out today for now yeah I mean give

it a night yeah uh uh what's it called

downtime see if you figure anything out

with that if you don't well repurpose it

okay I mean were you I mean like I could

hang onto it for a sec yeah I mean you

believe it are you evil you able to pick

it up though at the very least I mean

this isn't something where if you if you

just spend time suddenly something's

gonna happen but that would risk all has

to have a moment of enlightenment where

he figures it out okay okay so there's

something okay so here stuff just the

judge it's the only one that's well I

wouldn't express that look at that

attitude slim say that everything I've

done up to this point has been yeah

never been here

there's like I decide the whole maybe we

just said why don't you just give it to

judge you can I Xena it's the the rod is

of infernal nature and so is he

I'm gonna stare into the eyes of the

Hulk you stare into the eyes of the hawk

the Hawks eyes stare back into yours

[Laughter]

[Music]

[Laughter]

did you try the secret button under the

beak you could think about channeling

the vampiric Miss because that's what

it's supposed to summon I don't remember

what else we found out about it yeah so

the hour passes you guys heal yourselves

O'Driscoll diode I mean leech rubs his

rod in various ways and nothing seems to

happen there's a little blue pill you

could take when you whenever you attune

to an item can you decide to not yet

tune that item and males couldn't tune

to it

they mean can use like detuned yes on it

yes

depends on the item I think it varies

cuz not

some items some items are tuning to him

is literally just having them with you

for a while and getting used to them or

create creating affinity between them

some require command words and some

create a connection between you some

some take like the codices many of them

actually require you to burn hit dice

that you do not recover in order to

power them and so depending on the item

you may attune to it and then you stay

attuned until someone else' Tunes to it

and some of them meet you attuned to it

and then you could just decide to not be

attuned anymore

you play a dangerous game mr. Rob yes

come on

say I do the devil's work I being you do

you is exactly that you say I do the

devil's work I being you

I do the devil's work okay okay all

right well you're attune to the rod of

count you can feel now you have this you

have this connection I can tell you I

can tell you like what I think I've

already told you guys this but you know

that it allows you to command and summon

/ create but you're not exactly sure how

Undead

come on yeah summin summin and or create

you're not exactly sure out there's more

to this rod then meets yeah yeah it

meets undead okay you can you can use it

to command people although what counts

is commanding somebody you're not sure

exactly you can use it to persuade

people which is more likely to work than

command but has less drastic results so

it's more likely to work but it is less

powerful is the asleep stable teenis

like because leech knows what it's

capable of these things now yeah okay

but we don't automatically all of us get

that you do wha like I'm talking about

the recipe no no one else does I'm just

looking at it is well you could tell you

could just he could say what he thinks

no one's asked him and then it also

allows you to change change your form

although into the shape of bats well

you're you're not exactly sure what

forms you can turn into but it seems

like nocturnal creatures not gonna end

well

mate I dig you just fly okay so come on

someone and also grab that sword bro

[Laughter]

nefarious means yeah so now you're

attuned to the counter [ __ ] can't run

our online you know you can submit our

concept all that nonsense come on summon

and or crayon dead come on people

persuade people change form into

nocturnal creature it does more than it

does more than that it's gonna take time

for it to reveal itself to you so it's

more it's more than this yep oh my word

she's like an artifact yep yeah is that

it is it something that yep and is it I

guess I don't know this year but is it

on a long rest short rest do I guess you

know you have to experiment right okay

okay try it out why do people I can

reset persuade people as less it's it's

more likely to work but the effect is

less prompt it was like either can i

people so yeah you're not sure what that

means okay but do you feel it people

yeah this'll work on people and you look

around we by the way we have a discord

and in the discord we have a spoiler

channel for people to talk about the

chain we have a non spoiler channel for

people to talk about the chain and I

believe some of the people who've been

watching the Minecraft strains know more

about the cat the rod of count Road or

von glower then matters risk with us but

you only talk about that in the in the

spoiler channel yes may not the not

which you should super spoiler it

because if any of us go in there that

way we don't see it as well

[Laughter]

[Music]

first made more people would have been

useful this things Christmas to have you

man

why do you know why do you have more

abilities he only can eldritch blast

like let's make an inside check in sight

you say plus nothing 1616 that's pretty

good

yeah remember have you spilled of

Castile just plaster yeah and all those

cool powers you got from your patron

yeah you've definitely feel this void

this silence thank you kill miss

Kenneth's just what is what's 50 times 5

a lot know elders blast any more

questions just another 200 80 bucks

gifting 50 more 50 more people

subscriptions so those are you who you

can see I think who's gotten you your

subscription you can check thank can't

wait I'm gonna drop you like used to do

something it doesn't matter I'm just

gonna try and cause I know how does that

work what do you mean what kind of

target wall that wall yeah with what

with my oldest blast I want to see what

happen there is no yeah

know your patrons your link to your

patrons got the patron that the thing

that gives you all of your warlock

abilities you have none anymore

nothing just nothing comes out so now

you're just a scrub holy [ __ ] with a

broad lobby had to persuade you I've got

my sapphire rod still did not work still

I'm attuned to that what if you drop

what does it do you probably should try

yeah probably give someone good try

saying here's the land and dropping it

cast I could cast under step I can

regain a warlocks spell slot I could

cast a no sunlight sensitivity and I get

plus two warlocks spell attacks plus two

worse warlocks spell DC's oh and I can

do a reaction to being targeted by a

fifth level spell you dude you I mean it

doesn't sound like your patron likes

that no yeah we got to detune you from

this [ __ ] won't you give it to boots

yeah just kidding I'm not gonna do

that's right I kind of change my mind I

know I honey I hand it back to the city

come on

so so is this haha what is how does

leach feel now having in this moment

maybe he'll get better later but in this

moment having none of the abilities he's

been counting on and that feeling of

this connection to this greater power is

gone how do you feel lost lost without

it

I mean I'm intrigued by this is that a

rod but it's too much I lose I lose too

much to attune to this commander does

that under to me how do you know I have

no I do not want to do the devil's work

[Laughter]

as I hand in back well I do not give it

to the devil king it's up to the

commander sir

well you guys both pointed out that I

don't have any kind of celestial patron

so maybe I won't you don't feel you know

you still feel the way you did a minute

ago no [ __ ] oh you gonna make some

reparations my friend

you can't just snub the person who gives

you all your powers well did he know how

would he even know but the thing is he

knows that the rod itself is do the

devil's work take a bit of a chance at

our being punished for your greed mm-hmm

maybe whenever we go back to the

Sapphire sky back to a good standing

well [ __ ] it I might as well have it for

now I broke the window and I don't my

tell my parents that the window might as

well just [ __ ] all over the place I may

need that just to see me through the

night sir

I wonder we can use it on ilithyia a

change also it's an evil bride why are

we trying to use it on people I mean

that's a good point

all right I'm gonna give it to the

Sapphire sky so they can destroy it

mm-hmm I mean I told him we have it and

they said they said maybe you guys

should hang onto it

yeah we also need power I mean you're in

here trying to collect stuff to fight

Ajax yeah if we just keep giving up

everything that we get I can always do

what's the worst they can at us -

there's a couple people I don't think

have been so weird about this man and

what do you say brother record King

would describe

what did you say I whisper to the rod

I'm here did it else work restore to a

previous previous strength and now you

know what leech knew about the rod yeah

cool all of my swords and knives this

isn't the printout this is I can I can

sit here I can said oh hang on a minute

yeah there was a certain thing what I

can do as I can I guess a [ __ ]

commander you won't live to regret this

[Laughter]

just try Hardy chat I think if you check

the chain party chat discord there's

it's basically just what I said okay

that's written down I was but then I

ordered a dragon lady to be captured so

you have a message from angel your chi

or your number-one spy saying hey that

college kid wants to talk to you boss

we're gonna crack this open we're gonna

say no D through I'm gonna prep a

fireball to go through anything like in

that door we're gonna send oh did you go

check out that room and then we're gonna

bounce all right so this room o DZ l

right now yeah sorry gonna crack yeah

he's an L you say no yeah no I went back

for my oh now he's got it well in this

room there is just a bunch of victims of

the phage there's nothing left

do you want to send him through the door

there's a door another door yep there's

a silver door he stresses sakes Rd now

that's

that's adorable travel chori try try

your very best

no he does he does hey you hear this

like this desperate flapping sound so

I've got strikes in sight

I think we should okay I go on to the

room with the mummies if anything moves

Newcomb there is a so it's another room

it's the same size as this one yeah

actually I could just drop this footing

around gone through el now ahead in

school door NL all right I gotta open

the door in L to get to I oh I think

that word other doors outside out now

there's a door here we're out here okay

this is where they came out and this oh

yeah a similar room to this once

thousands of years ago there were images

maybe it's a language carved on the not

just the walls but also the floor and

the ceiling every surface is covered in

this stuff but in the thousands of years

since this place was built it is a worn

away and you can't make anything out

sitting in the middle there's no other

doorway out of here that you can see

sitting in the middle of the room is a

giant it's like 12 feet tall so twice

the size of a man cauldron metal iron

appearing could be you an alloy cauldron

well there is a metal ladder that

reaches to the lip of the cauldron

attached to it and there appear to be

images carved around the exterior but

you can't make it out from here in the

hallway there's a sound well silence

then dived in to fly over the cauldron

see there's anything in it

what does think alternative is a

cauldron absorb will fly in uh-huh

there's a there's a giant cauldron what

are you gonna have him do

look into it fly up over the top there's

something inside there's something

inside well what is it Odie its he sees

he you see through his eyes okay look

he's very tall you see it's this like

it's this membranous kind of slowly

writhing pulsing the whole the column is

huge so whatever's in this thing is big

it's almost by first it looks like

there's a super or something in the air

but you can tell that it's and it looks

it looks wet like moist and it's just

this membranous surface with its yellow

yellow almost like skin and there's

fibers white snaking fibers that

crisscross back and forth mm-hmm light

sources room

oh no I look at the carvings on me

round' they don't appear to be any

different than the ones you guys have

passed a dozen times before okay okay I

can't make any nice but every once in a

while it looks like maybe that's a

person maybe that's a symbol like

pyramid or something but it's nothing

else in this room it's no it's not the

way that's both work either

in this edition how does it work well it

lets you detect like types of monsters

oh yeah yeah well yeah I get to attend

it it's not detect alignment so like the

images on the side of the cauldron are

the same as like the images on the wall

so oh oh what do you looking at the

images on the coffee yeah

yeah Nicole drew um yeah you see is

images of funguses and slimes I has

something to do with molds so from the

thing that we read the paperwork like

all the evil [ __ ] is on this floor so

you really want to know

an ochre jelly up above remember cuz

like that was what what his face casted

the Sun the Sun elf he casted that thing

that was eating everybody oh yeah just

touch a little bit he happens to it

Quivers did no ID that I mean he my

character but this thing it's just okay

huh how much you want to poke it again

yeah go on go on IDs put your little

impact on something use yeah seriously

let's go ahead and close the door now

backtracking do you boo DS cart well I

can be there's like Vince is sorely

vexed by this light yeah well I mean

it's dangerous because uh I know dogs

well know about cats don't go to the

point where there's always looking for

the light and they they it freaks them

out and it'll it'll tell you Sydney's

cat man comes when ha I can't

if they huh which is her hand on the

laser right I turn it off poison like

he's a vicious or something you know

some motion some some very rapid motion

was too good some very rapid motion and

something mouth claw i something

happened and then he's gone mouth clue

or I love it and he's gone an evening in

the dancing minstrel maybe more

appealing the bits is it's this goofy

but it's still an item that someone

could take that collagen problem when

use it or they're only do dis generate

or do something yeah but we have to do

something to it also we owe it's called

and you know what it looks like we can

you know inform skip-bo figure out maybe

deal with they might know about it's

it's huge

okay that's 12 feet tall I think it's

probably 20 we can't pick it up no no no

like you guys might all be able to pick

it up right it's it looks like it's just

like a solid cast iron giant [ __ ]

calm if someone's [ __ ] boo be able to

goop or fall out so it's me like I think

yeah wait drag you in whose five days

gone off all I mean best will do is dump

it out in the room contain it somehow to

the dancing minstrel sir yeah your

spell's a little bit over it we're okay

now

yeah 20 hip points down yeah I'm good

I'm good to least get back to the

minstrel I have no more healings master

you're not fighting within the cauldron

versus the potential of you

to fight on the way back to the dancing

minstrel just to be clear even talking

about fighting the Coleman I'm not okay

with the fight on the way back okay

outside I'm sorry I mean we got to get

rid of it but I don't know if this is

the time anymore I can't even I can't

even do angry telling us should

definitely love them we wouldn't want

the enemy hurting it yes if they get

something once before it out on someone
