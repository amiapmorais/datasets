we are MCM productions and we play D&D

we are Motorhead are we play rock'n'roll

[Music]

[Music]

that was your that was your logo Phil

that was awesome designed by Dan

Connolly and then you updated yes

so I mean this is it this is the show

and I feel like this is probably the

most viewers were all over happy so I'm

gonna just take a couple seconds and

thank all people cluding tom schmuck for

that awesome intro you just saw and

yunchan for doing the he did the MCD and

presents part Yun Chen did the chain

intro custom intro for our dandy game

and our friend Silvano did Silvana

Matthews did all the music you just

heard and also I just first of all I

want to thank my players for waiting a

year it was like a year and a half ago

we were like hey where we gonna play dee

dee again and like well I had this idea

so thanks for being patient also super

super thanks to the unsung hero of this

entire thing our friend Jerry who is

about 30 feet over in that direction in

his own room and and if it wasn't for

him we would literally not be doing this

right now it was close

came down to the wire but he pulled it

off so let's see what have you folks

missed oh I want to thank our sponsor

our first and maybe only ever sponsor

you

you folks back the Kickstarter you folks

paid for this these cameras these

microphones these lights the studio is

all as a result of the Kickstarter and

and you have enabled us to glyph this

crazy dream where we get to play a D&D

live and some people watch and who knows

what'll happen the thing you missed is

that I promised everybody that you would

get to see us make characters live on

the stream cuz I thought that would be a

lot of fun but then I changed my mind

because I thought that would be

incredibly tedious and boring and it'd

be 45 minutes of people saying wait what

is this a proficiency bonus and which I

which skill is the one I want to take

and that's not interactive and it's not

fun to watch so what we did was we all

everybody came and made characters and

they rolled dice and they generate their

stats but they all did it separately so

the players do not know this would be

the first time many of the players have

seen the other characters they've made

and we filmed the die rolling part and

we made a video

that we're all gonna watch now so not

only are you gonna get to meet the

heroes of this campaign for the first

time so are the players okay so now can

we tell who that is just buy the dice

they're using wooden toys you can't read

I think as long as yes I think so

so twelve thirteen nine so far I think

this is this is a sign of things to come

this is Captain average a professor a

solution doctor average 15 I think is as

good as it gets for this dude too low so

I had up my own little house rule which

is you get to re-roll the stat if it's

below eight I think for eight or lower

and then if your total bonuses didn't

equal plus two or more if you had a

player bonuses if it wasn't plus two or

more than you get to reroll and I don't

think anybody had to reroll actually a

couple of people got the eight or lower

problem so this is a human fifth level

everybody starts a fifth level fighter

battle master which is as close to a

warlord the commander lay that guy well

the chain is the place to be a ninja

Lord 12 well unfortunately there's no

way for you to get out right you

literally are trapped here it's probably

a bad idea Lord it's probably bad I

didn't try to get out because you'll

trip over something or break something

twelve twelve twelve fifteen fifteen

this is the most average group ever well

I think for last the best stats I think

for those number one and number two in

the total bonuses well you know if you

strategically place your stats and then

you pick the right ancestry then you can

end up with some decently high stats by

the time you're safe level okay you may

of course of course

yeah cuz neither feel nor Laura's

pugilist is a coupling of that guy

the lieutenant yes so that ya pugilist

is a custom class I think you can get it

on the D unskilled they're using my dice

those are the Madagascar rosewood the

electric inlay fifteen twelve thirteen

again once again no one gets a heist at

the good news is the good news is your

Scouts aren't gonna be low the bad news

is your stats are not gonna be totally

legal character the difference which is

not I did not prescribe that these

people just wanna play humans

nails is a badass name for a

sorcerer Tom sooner or later these guys

do not match so who could this possibly

be matching dice one of those literally

had like 30 sets of dice 16 so far is 16

the high staff in the entire group

okay ready for this some pretty good

rolls look at this

charisma based a lot of people thought

paladin when they were like oh that's

how high charisma paladin that's very

very good guess that's what fills when

Phil saw the retainers okay

nice it'll record so the ill rigor is a

custom class that I built from scratch

right so I think if Jerry if things are

working well then you'll be able to

everybody watching can now read about

the I think you ran into him at

Starbucks if you're gonna play that this

is the this is the party to do it I mean

the name of the group is the chain

hopefully Jerry has got it set up so

that folks can be apart Jerry yeah so I

ordered this video in order of the most

normal characters to the weirdest

characters know from most normal to

weirdest no one got an 18 yeah so I

think that went pretty well

yeah I built Tom want to play Beast

Master Ranger he wanted to have a cool

pet and we talked about him having like

a boule I thought it'd be cool from the

ride around on a boule what's a boule

it's like it's like it's a lamb it's a

giant like rhinoceros sized so I mean

I'm fixed to the Ranger for you sort of

yeah like I just get bashed something

together that people should if Jerry has

the link hooked up

cherry directly clicked up yes

productions awesome MCM productions calm

/the - chain should take you to a link

those all documents all the handouts and

everything including the Ranger that

it's not a new Ranger I just kind of

replaced some of the existing Rangers

abilities and talking to Tom about how

he thought his cap clash would work with

you know teaming up with being his pet

being like a team member that he

coordinates with we threw some stuff in

there this is all super alpha stuff the

ill rigger no-one's ever played this

before so you're gonna see a lot of

crazy probably overpowered or unbalanced

or just broken stuff well actually I

prefer I prefer like overpowered stuff

because I find it it's easier to down

something back right if somebody likes

if I like it but everyone agrees this is

crazy overpowered I can start dialing it

back but if it's broken and doesn't work

people just get frustrated out of the

game they don't wanna play anymore so

let's see oh by the way thanks to our

friend Jason for all that awesome

character art I think you're not the

part also are you guys now we're

actually gonna get into this is the pep

talk that I normally give my players of

new campaign but I waited for you guys

to be here and that is that this session

might be kind of short because I usually

like to just get like one or two combats

under our belt and then call it good and

do a buncha setup because you guys have

never played these characters before we

have never played together at this group

has never played D&D together so it's

probably gonna be weeks or months before

you guys actually figure out like who

your characters are and you got put

somebody put a lot of thought into your

backstory but then you got to play the

character and things may change you may

discover that specialization that you

picked you don't like or you can you

know the way you're even the class you

chose for the background all of that

stuff is stuff we can swap out as we

play as we find out how stuff works

don't worry about any of that stuff you

will discover who your characters are

over time you don't forget it right out

of the gate that's totally normal

also you guys have a bunch of magic

items Matthew still if not only one

person who's really picked well yeah

okay there's the Phil took the built of

hill giant strength and then everyone

else is like I kind of like this I'm

kind of like that and then so much this

is all completely by the rules fifth

edition is a thar's guide to everything

I think we used actually the belt of

hill giant strength is because fellow

youtuber Janie Nicholson came down here

to have lunch and hang out and I was

almost done in the last item I had to

come up with was like what's the coolest

died on the chain has and so I just gave

this sounds cool and there were a couple

things a lot more even the last which

was kind of over the top the stuff that

you guys don't pay is just going to be

in party treasure and that means you

guys have access to it but you're not

going to be able to get it in schools do

want scroll I believe

climbing in the Treasury then okay

[Music]

absolutely but even like role which you

know if they're in junior officers or

just rank and file around they problem

okay so because what I've done is I've

printed out cards with everybody's

titles of grants and what they do so for

instance judge is the leptin master so

these aren't on your character sheet

because they don't belong to your

character they are a title that belongs

to the company if your character dies

you're gonna pass this on to somebody

else

phil is the lieutenant yeah the

commander the standard bearer and the

staff sorcerer so you guys want to go

around the table and just say and also

Lara's made me a special one you're

everyone's favorite wanker

there's still a huge

especially from Mars thank you

so yeah what is your thing dude I am the

staff sorcerer

I studied The Chronicle during a long

rest and choose a spell and no that can

be cast at higher levels I'm a cast this

spell at one higher level without using

a higher level spell slots does that

make sense

maybe a little bit like a lot of your

spell say hey if you cast this first

level spells aside for the second level

slot it doesn't what stuff yep and that

means you get the benefit of that stuff

without having to the standard if you

fall unconscious after an enemy attack

all members of change within 60 inches

feet sorry can move up to their speed as

a reactions if I go down we can't let

that standard touch the dirt okay so the

lieutenant once per battle is as a

reaction to a senior officer rolling

initiative you may swap two officers

initiative results so officers are all

of us right so if he gets a really good

one and he's really cocky one we want

him to go first exactly that's exactly

right just lets you kind of be like he's

the commander you're the lieutenant you

are sort of more tactical he's more high

level what is the weapon master do the

weapon master when a senior officer

rules damage with a weapon attack they

treat all ones as twos so good roll a

one it's just honestly a two that's only

for weapon attacks yes yeah little the

idea is that judge is just an expert

with weapons and spends his downtime

kind of sharpening things and making

sure you guys have the best weapons the

first place yes I'm the commander as a

bonus action I can choose a senior

officer of the

Chane they may either move their speed

or gain a free melee attack once per

about once per battle that something's

even more slightly warlord II than you

are

yep all right so I think I threatened

that this was going to be one of that

they pretty kind of cinnamon there's

gonna be a big cinematic quasi railroad

II opening to this but then as we play

over the next like this session in the

next session things are gonna open up

you guys get a lot more freedom in

choice so one of these cameras is up I

think that's the one that people can see

blues light painting painted this is a

Pegasus minis model yeah he did an

amazing job with like the torches the

torches illuminating the walls and the

stained glass is pretty cool yeah we

need to have a light behind there yeah

if there was a light in here yeah that

would be awesome

I have no idea there's no top to this

but it looks like there's a place to put

tops weird all three of these working I

think only the middle is the middle one

is the one that people can watch on the

mainstream I forgot to tell anybody that

we have two streams we literally have

two streams one is the one you're

watching right now MGM the other one is

/ MC d m2 and I think we need to switch

back to the yeah the other ones MC BM -

and that's the stream that is the

overhead camera and all the tactile

cameras and that way if you are

obviously if you're on mobile it's not

gonna be great but if you're on your

computer at home you can be switching

back and forth and minimize or maximize

any window launched and get yeah you

could use simultaneous aim time but the

idea is that it's very limited our

ability to show you what's happening on

the table I tend to run a kind of

tactical game so the second stream is

literally anis I think it's like 15

frames a second or something like that

so it's super low bandwidth this is the

Cathedral of Saint Clement the

journeyman

and it is the largest building in Black

Bottom and it is probably the last

freestanding Church in all of as Lauria

because the Ajax the overlord destroyed

all the churches and that was actually

quite a white black bottom is a big city

it's one of the biggest cities in vaz

Laurie it's a port city and it's a six

o'clock in the morning it's just after

daybreak and black bottom like you guys

have been all over the world this is a

big city for the locals that live here

but you guys have seen an alloy you guys

have seen the city of brass so this

place is like a hovel to you none of the

buildings are taller than like three

stories it's a big deal to have a

building like this and this is where

this is where the final contract of the

chain begins what was the contract

captain lieutenant this is where you

debrief the rest of the party so we've

been hired we got to assassinate ajax

ajax the Invincibles

his wizard yeah the contradict assessing

his wizard yeah so if you saw on the

opening there was like the contract in

the back oh yeah so you know the wizard

that makes his castle float yeah that

was it and created the war breed that

was okay yeah so okay so we have five

arrows that you were most likely gonna

use mom because I think you're the only

arrow boy that we got and I got

according to the person that gave us the

contract that it'll get through all of

his boards it's made out of the same

stuff as the teeth of Dragon which is

swords we had in write other campaign

yeah that Jess's character ran away with

and we've been hired by Jess the Baron

of the whole wrath who's from the last

campaign and Nicodemus character so we

got later we've been hired by them we've

been hired by them to kill the staff oh

wow so well we know as the chain is that

Ajax has basically been taking out all

civilized life and conquering it and we

kind of had a choice to make what we

were gonna do what side we're gonna be

on the other mercenary company that we

know about is dunzo the tower I think

they're cold yeah

so you know we can either make a stand

now or we can be hunted down yeah this

is something about this like I remember

she said actually yeah you can see it's

the contract you can see the things

names more so what we know is that he's

going to walk out that door at 6:00 a.m.

when the bells toll he's in there being

a priest in this temple they're trying

to switch them over to you worship Ajax

if he's the saint and that also happens

in last campaign so we gotta figure out

what we're gonna do he's gonna be in

there he's gonna walk out this door

that's it when he comes out we need to

come we gotta jump in got it so he's

there's people out here there's there's

guards at the church my suggestion was

that we you know pose as city guards I

don't think it's gonna work for you

because you're a goblin probably not

thinking tells your

so your name in man you're gonna be

sniping anyway most likely with the

arrows so I don't know I assume this is

a building right yeah those are

buildings yeah yeah you can and those

are alleys the black bottom is

notoriously with twisty windy narrow

streets and the volcanoes are buildings

yeah the wards are the wards on him

the boards are on him so he's guarded by

you know don't you have a ton of like

model building something yeah but I

don't wanna block everything so uh yeah

well we'll use that we'll use that in

other scenarios well like if I put a mic

here you wouldn't be able to see what

the hell's going on that's right so Ivan

had a lot of time to figure out tactics

for this obviously got it and here we

are so the only thing I got is that we

come in as city guards so people are

gonna think much of us probably Phil and

I since we're melee fighter type people

we're gonna get up near them we can't

attack him I don't think until you can

land a hit so that's where we can maybe

use your lieutenant ability to make sure

tom has the highest initiative I would

think that we might get some sort of

surprise but who knows if he knows what

we're gonna do

yeah this is us kind of figuring it out

what are these buildings look like they

slanted roof flat-topped

they're slanted roof yeah okay yeah are

there any upper storey windows looking

out onto the street uh yeah there are

yeah all these buildings have these like

private reticent presidencies yeah this

is one of the nice parts of town so it's

as these are these tend to be two-story

building with some three-story buildings

yeah there are people kind of it's very

light traffic it's just added on but

that you know shortly after dawn the

bells are ringing for the first service

so we were given this contract last

night yeah right okay so we've had we've

had time to plan yeah you've had time to

scout the area out and plan yeah I mean

there's maybe like moves maybe like

eight or nine people walking around out

there was somebody setting up a cart

getting ready to sell apples for the

church where the two guards and you said

that he's inside beating up the priest

they're trying to cover their tracks

and not beating okay okay you never know

yeah cuz maybe the because I don't know

if the priest is any power whatsoever

but if so might be inclined to us does

so what is what is the reaction of

people in the city to seeing like horn

head and the Goblin well that's a good

question do you guys walk around like do

you have any aversion to people knowing

who you are there's nothing there's no

law part of it and we're like this is

part of the chain which is a large group

of and we all have like black bottom is

pretty eclectic because of support city

and in fact a lot of people use it to

trade like people who have no trade with

fast Lauria will trade here at black

bottom and as a result you see all kinds

of crazy stuff here okay so you see it's

not unusual like people it's unusual but

it's not like that's never happened so

when people see you first like that and

actually a tea fling is super unusual

and so they'll stop and stare and

whisper afterwards and they'll talk

about demoness and stuff like that but

no one raises a ruckus no one calls the

cops right well no one's are much less

rare I'm just enabling thinking that if

if the street isn't heavily populated

right it's gonna look weird to see so

well I think Tom should be posted up

somewhere where he's gonna have vantage

over there is a heavy fog everywhere on

the ground it's still very early I don't

know anybody's name oh right we should I

know I know nails nails and a judge do

not actually have a name you're just huh

commanders what I'm supposed to be

called the commander so your characters

probably like Heimlich Lars knows what

his character his nickname was before he

became the

character head was red yeah right so

yeah you guys well you guys all remember

him most of you probably remember this

red all right yeah wait so you go by the

commander you go but it goes by the

commander yeah okay there's like in

front of all the rest of the you know

people it would be considered almost

insubordinate yeah so it's like the

commander's the top he tells us

Concannon is it the lieutenant then is

like the next yes sir

like your character actually saved my

dudes life long before so I think you

would know my my character's name sweet

is it what does it weird you out when

does it weird sweet out what other

officers in the chain just refer to man

as a lieutenant or do you prefer to call

okay I think I think he would probably

prefer to be like for his friends to

call has he seen his many I don't think

so did you put your Vinny in your in

your drawer oh yeah yes happened

I want people to see Tommy so yeah what

I was thinking was that it'd be cool if

we could get copper up high off the

street but he's a private residences

well I mean make an investigation show I

don't know if we want to put those in

front of the tactical stream I think

that's team so I got a seven so this

house is much like the other ones it's a

it's a nobles house although keep mind

that a noble go by bottom is like

really nice place but there doesn't

appear to be anybody coming in round you

know there's activity in the other

houses but not in this one so maybe it's

it's well I thought I forgot my mini

that's cool where's where's Leon Thomas

minis dope and that's a mini anime yeah

and and it hit bash that thing together

like 48 hours there was you know mini

like two days ago

[Music]

okay so then why don't we like at least

during the night you know try to get in

there and get in the house that looks

like it might be oh so then we can sit

Oh

copper up in the upper window okay yeah

that sounds good I mean cuz there's

hardly any distance between the front of

the church yeah that's definitely within

shooting range yes one I have the arrows

supposedly have a limited range or they

do so but I mean I'm sure I'm sure

that's fine who's trying to get into the

house this is like technically the

evening before or the we want to get

copper posted up yeah it's about it's a

little after midnight when the commander

and lieutenant show up and say alright

this is the job and the job is basically

alright so I think if you guys are gonna

be breaking and entering

judge is probably gonna be off on the

corner just keeping an eye out and not

really getting involved in whatever that

is we need you not on the street though

cuz people are gonna be drawn to a demon

man

around right it's gonna be like they

know like so I mean it's uh I guess I

should say that like it's probably been

a couple of days since the chain arrived

in black bottom there's like 360

soldiers that are now in the taverns

some of which are just right down the

street from here so people know the

chain is in town the fact it's not a

secret that you got it's not a secret

that you guys are here and you're it's

not unusual for mercenary companies to

roll into town especially consuming

Black Bottom against a port city and it

just means a lot of opportunity for

people who have to have earns or make

money and they'll jack up the prices and

charge you a lot so the fact is

especially the fact that like you've got

I think all of you have the chain symbol

so you know people know if they see

they're gonna freak out

[Music]

[Laughter]

so people need to be able to see mystery

that's crazy it does look like a

transfer and if it's not that see more I

love them by the way this is this is

Jerry's idea to use regular everyday

smartphones as the tackle of cameras

because tactical cameras because they

are not only really good cameras and

he's got these little stands but they

have a monitor built into them so we can

actually see what you folks see

uncatchable screening and that is yeah

look we had webcams before and you just

we couldn't see what the people what the

viewers are watching alright so yeah you

guys are about six hours to plan and

plot and skiing gotcha so I mean we

don't have any feed rogues do we have

any kind of dispel any thing like that

like what do you have some sort of spell

that we can dispel what there something

like that we don't right now player well

he's got wards and stuff but that's what

the harrows afford well I'm more

thinking of getting into the house the

breaking in in aren't you I can I can I

mean I have the used tools and I is is

picking walks sleight of hand in 5th

edition because I don't have it's a

function of having these tools if you

have these tools then you can make I

think it's a dexterity chef of

proficiency I think actually I think

actually we have low latency chat turned

on yeah I'm curious as to whether or not

we can instead of looking it off if we

can get an answer from chat

that'd be great moderator just went yes

I think it works one of these three ways

it's your dexterity prosper craft as

fast yeah let's go look at that works

I'm a huge believer by the way in

enfranchising chat and trying to make

chat part of the process it's very

difficult we have a couple of ideas one

of which you're gonna see later in the

stream but part of that is just we have

mods the mods know a lot about D&D you

folks know a lot about D&D the wisdom of

crowds means that we might be able to

actually save time at the table instead

of stopping the game to look something

up we could just ask Chad and find out

and it's apparently it's thieves tools

lets you use your Dex poster oceans in

my bar see if I am preferably a back

door if there is one there are side

doors in the back door yeah come like

one in the alley or well also it's it's

super late at night 18:18 is more than

enough though no one in this part of

town has even the noblemen are not used

to basically professional they make sure

it's coming by to try to break into

their house it's a nice lock don't get

me wrong by the way it's a nice lock

yeah

can we all five of these need him

before they said they will kill him okay

yeah I mean we brought up that we could

use more than that but that's all we got

okay was the plan that copper and hang

out in this place all night yeah slowly

over time as members of chain dies like

I want to be a goblin just an army of

goblins on display so yeah all right so

we're in yeah it's an it's a it's a nice

house but there are coverings like

sheets over everything and there is a

very very very thin almost unnoticeable

layer of dust somebody's there stairs

Dorian Gray or some there are

stairs up mmm check it out yeah

what do you want we want to get into

that one there's a study like like where

you would relax and have you know coffee

or smoke so stuff like that there's a

huge bay window with I got balcony and

okay so I'm gonna say post up here sure

have you can't watch your back yeah the

cat big cat is a large creature so are

you do you write it into the building or

do

okay okay so you you ride you ride this

displacer feets into this nobles house

and you can hear it behind you because

there's this noise this cacophony of a

displacement he's just knocking

everything over yeah yeah well I mean

the big cats do her best

yeah it's you know it's not a displace

or be size palace so as a result you can

hear the sound of paintings on the walls

the stairs clattering and falling off

and so you know eventual stealth is not

really common well I think that the can

if we split up but yeah and and if

you're not trying to squeeze through

this is not this is like you know cats

normally like manacles yeah has two

hands six legs basically yeah and so

yeah and it's it once it gets up there

you see you see you're looking you're

looking outgoing is a good place to set

up copper coming up here and yeah copper

is literally riding this thing is head

is scraping the ceiling and he's writing

on the cat pretty low the cat sees you

and the cat just kind of flops down so

what do we what do we didn't get to you

ask questions I asked but now what do we

know about the boards other than that

the arrows are supposed to get thrown

you know that like the chronicle talks

about powerful wizards being able to

ward themselves and that the wards

happen automatically even if the wizard

isn't aware what's going on and they're

defensive but they can also do things

like warts can do things like summon

creatures so the there are lots of

cactus to deal with but they're all and

they all they typically involve a higher

level party like a lot of the encounters

the crop the chain have dealt with

past thousand years that deal with

wizards that hi you're typically higher

level and you can do things like you can

counter their words so it doesn't

actually it sort of assumes that whoever

is reading this is high enough level to

understand how high-level Wizards work

but the idea is they're defensive but

they can do things like summon creatures

or whatever and they go off

automatically the person doesn't even

have to be aware is happening do we know

what this was Ernest traveling Ollie by

the party and if so how many because

you're the one to talk to ladies area I

did not talk to latest Ariel you talk to

ladies Harry off-screen I talk to you

guys what was the question I was

learning how many uh like if the wizard

trapped has to travel alone or the was

are traveling with like a group she said

he probably will be alone ok

the others guards other the church has

guards

I imagine if he's going there trying to

shake up the church that I don't

anticipate them running Tuesday and

unless they've just sworn oh really

fealty right

they might it's true good to see it like

you know the mercenaries causing trouble

yeah I think you know we probably would

have asked for a description of this guy

right sure yeah never seen him well we

didn't have very long in there yeah Matt

do we know any like that yeah I just I

don't have to describe I guess we know

so yeah lady Cyril knows exactly what

the students like even though the other

people with him or just taking her word

for it but Morton looks like nobleman he

dresses and really fine clothes he has a

cape he has a high collared cape and dr.

strange he had was a little it's a it's

a sort of doctor stranger and he wears a

skullcap

he wears a silver skullcap and he you

know is somewhat notoriously sinister

looking a chapter that wouldn't happen

to be over similar-looking cave it's

gonna wait for the dragon

hike it could be yeah yeah let's Yanks

what was your question and if it was a

cape that we put in the book okay well I

mean he's a Chinese these H accident

visibles wizard he's got lots of magic

yeah I mean dimensioned or can one it

just like you know grab them and jump

through and just never see us again

alright so we know we're gobble we don't

know we know we're copper copper and big

cat are gonna be where the rescue flow

is gonna be alright what are these other

buildings they're also noble girl houses

so are we doing there's a tavern just

right down the street

what was the name of the same for the

church Saint Clement yeah he's a saint

of mouse he's one of the gods of as

Lauren is the god of like knowledge and

craftsmanship so it's my question if I

try to mail them inwards Ward's are

still up do I have a rough idea of

what's gonna happen so he said I

appreciate this as a reference to the

black company in the ambush of the liver

as far as I know that spirits probably

subconscious otherwise it was fun having

Lars reading the black dumping books and

being like okay they finally killed the

liver I was like that's true it's among

the many books you haven't finished

great yeah all right so all right so are

we doing the town guard thing well he

said that we could have been you know

wait time we have leading up through

that we could have gotten some so we're

not out there conspicuously well don't

forget you guys you guys have junior

officers you can rely on although this

is supposed to be top secret so they

probably shouldn't know depending on how

much I wouldn't know we just need some

static questions so I don't think you

guys are going to need this but I have

actually index cards for all of the

junior officers I swim okay so they are

around yeah but I don't expect you to

need them in combat

you just we just have them grab us some

uniforms okay no problem they'll take

care of that yeah so you and I could be

that I love you what you want to do with

your guy schmuck uh well I'm from fast

Laureus so I don't stick out too much no

he looks like a native I don't have

points man I'm ahead six tentacle so am

i but it's us

our colors I don't know you look around

yeah this area straight to me yeah oh

really

yeah okay yeah yeah well what do you

think lieutenant should I hang outside

and flank him

yeah I think we should just get in our

guards uniforms and sort of mosey around

Lebel act natural yeah and like we'll

hang out down here and then when the

bells start ringing we'll just start

walking no it's not but the the hour is

a holy hour a daily so crawl so when the

bells up with the bells call people to

service so when the bells are these

people are gonna start showing up in it

is it 630 feet is six squares yes so

it's been so long that's right that's

right it's only been a week for you

right but it's been a long time all

right so problem we're gonna be a lot of

stuff once combat breaks out that people

are gonna forget you and get wrong why

you guys were breaking in that place I

was just at the corner of Sharpe Ian

yeah yeah now we need to figure out

warrior where are you gonna be at this

corner and we're gonna fill be within

cuz this is roughly six to get up if we

want to you know charge look I don't

know if we're gonna get surprised or

anything like that

well should be surprised

well like an amateur someone I mean this

and arrows and arrows and am I waiting

from a signal from the commander or

someone or am I just oh I used to be and

that's what's gonna trigger us worried

that people remember my nethack run that

is a

amazingly successful nethack run that

started when I ate my bat gap that's

they're afraid that that's gonna happen

a big pet cat and big cats can I don't

like I mean you guys the guy until this

room is appear

but judge is a kind of intimidating guy

so also judge can definitely carry

himself nobly so if the bells start

ringing if it's about to be Church time

well no that'd be really unusual

well Clement the journeyman and the god

that he has the same time are both super

neutral gods like they are they are he

is a god of craftsmanship all right

and Saint Clement is the god of

apprentices there's a saint of

apprentices so it's it's not you're not

going to get any kind of like for

business you're not gonna get like I'm

not gonna like Emily no you're not gonna

sell family Nakada there's not gonna be

any sense of like good or evil coming

from this church okay from judges point

of view it's gonna be a completely

neutral place yeah because the thing is

one of the reasons it's still standing

because the only thing is I'm worried

about it's like if I grab him and try to

do something to them in the wards fire

off that might be bad news for me

well we we definitely need him to start

with the arrows because the arrows are

what are going to take down the wards so

we can't like we're going to get

wrecked if we do anything before an

arrow hits so Tom misses were kind of in

trouble I'm gonna get ya give me some

work well maybe so then maybe either

judge could be like sort of around the

corner on the side on the side of the

thing could be inside like the front

door and brush out the front door well I

guess let's let's take one step

backwards

you're a custom thing I have no idea

what you can do so you're punch the

out if you touch things but like what so

like say you're gonna come in and get

attacked what what is the thing that

you're gonna do to make you be the most

effective like I said I'm gonna punch

the out of this ass no but like so

for here on here I'll start I'm gonna go

up and I'm a battle master so I'm gonna

use one of my maneuvers which is goading

attack try to get in to focus on me

mm-hm

so you guys can get advantage that kind

of yeah that's cool because if if you

get if we can set it up so that I have

advantage then I can do haymakers which

will give me maximum die damage okay but

I guess I get I get hurt I get fired

Wow yeah but yeah I get disadvantaged on

hand makers but you know we could cancel

it out like yeah okay yeah

what's your chance to hit with your

punches like a seven I got a plus eight

plus a it's pretty good

yeah my I also I can I can do three

punches I believe Wow because I get I

get an extra attack I connect attack

twice instead of once whenever you take

attack action and then I also have

where's it at the old one-two is a

couple of you have to careful with it

like actually I might be able to do so

Tom what do we have for you like what

can we do anything to improve your

chance - oh just condone at the bar know

a little Eric again I was just gonna

mention it okay okay so part of my yeah

uh well that's the that's that's the no

okay I just call it monster tamer

yeah monster tamer so yeah I could be

wrong but I think I can do four so one

of the one of the abilities that I have

is Kenai if I don't move on my turn as a

bonus action I can make a wisdom check

against an enemy and if I get that one

mark if I get one mark on them I'll get

advantage on my next attack yeah so I

could do the bus as long as you don't

move

yeah you can use your bonus action to

mark the guy so on so one end you can

immediately shoot it with your actual if

I if I make this yeah but then you're

yeah so if I do that just one mark over

I can yeah advantage um I think I'm a

ways back so I can I can't give you an

extra attack there's a bummer man I do

have to tax oh you okay the first one

will have an advantage if I make

destroyed and then that one that

consumes the market yeah I definitely

want to be within 30 feet of this guy to

be able to do I think almost all of my

stuff so you're if you're here one

two three four five six so your your one

or two away from well maybe I should be

over by the pillar kind of over here

direction kind of opposite of how your

nails in here just chillin like a

villain

yeah I just got there like the way the

the heel kicked up on it you're you're

gonna try to get it closed we're gonna

try to get advantage schmuck what are

you gonna do when you comes out the door

well we'll see what happens I think I

need to wait until one of these arrows

hits well no absolutely but we're like

it's gonna be that we're gonna plan to

basically we're going to set up our

action so he comes out of the door Tom

gets a shot and Tom taking a strop it's

gonna be what I don't have intentionally

so I don't have you think I would but my

mini collection is somewhat random I

don't have you peasant peasant minis

these guys are just random Gargas though

yeah but there's not this many cards

right so these are just random peasants

there's actually guys setting up a cart

right here selling apples right there

I'm eyeing those apples are not couches

yes setting up or is he selling he's

setting up he's getting ready for the

bells to ring people to show up yeah

if this were we should like that way you

don't think what I said was you

sacrifice all

if you did that if you sacrifice to

language then you guys know the secret

language of the chain

[Music]

[Music]

okay okay so okay so what I'm gonna do

fireballs bolts so just FYI this is one

of the first times table is ever played

D&D V battle so it's no surprise do

there's miscommunication we're figuring

stuff out that's normal sure okay well I

guess I mean

whenever he comes out after that words

go down flowers oh nice okay yeah I know

that does all right well I mean they've

seen this before what is it you're

talking about doing burning hallo mmm I

gift an enemy with a fiery halo that

infects their mind with infernal

thoughts causing them to see allies as

enemies so I choose a creature and they

have to succeed on the charisma saving

throw against peeny which good luck and

while under my sway a halo of fire

floats above their head and they have to

use I basically use my action and I am

them and they are just using their

allies I had an immediate I thought I

look like Billy the Blue Ranger but

Marcy's alright

we need a solution but I'm glad Jason

was still here there boo this is really

nice dude the disgrace actually actually

it's not a crap see what I've got a

pretty beefy deception bonus so as I

walk by I'm just gonna give him one of

the old listen I just pocket his pocket

you're gonna he's gonna steal an apple

that he couldn't pay for he's got plenty

of money he's got but he just wants to

steal kinda like barter with the guy

I'll wait away philosophy back so

this guy's probably yeah like Oh badass

women - shouldn't the partners parts are

close to LA where there's about to be a

wizard bail that's true that's what he

gets your moment a snake again yeah yeah

whenever one of town's turned into a

bunch of bunnies okay that's what I get

so we're just going for long as you get

back answer the question Lars can I go

refill my water is then crazy

that's gonna go down stand by guys

question while we're waiting no so it

says do you not want me to turn you may

use your bone section to make a wisdom

persist perception check against an

enemy the DC is 8 plus hit enemies hit

die if you are successful you have

parked to be so huh I'm actually

confused how does it maybe that sounds

like something combined from something

else no keep the keen eye so jealous

that you guys were actually able to use

the character you don't know what the

deuce is that's normal okay like when

you attack

so but what is it same thing it's a

number I have is it comparing what is it

about well you you make a rule do you

make a with some perception shadow

Wizards one - tyrant at all their PCP

basically basically you think it's their

level a higher level they are the harder

it is for your Thor yeah yeah of course

so it's all on you Tom I try to use the

phone you come here versus but even if

that doesn't work and this guy is too

high level which is entirely likely even

this guy is way too high level for that

ability to work they're still the best

archer in the chain yeah they use it

that's a shame

why isn't it whisper wizards and five

four fires the bells ring yeah all right

no I apologize for the crudity of the

model I didn't have to actually scale

yep as it turns I didn't have time to

build it just Galen I get a payment so

the doors open after the bells ring and

a priest comes out and the ramón's of

Saint Clement to the journeyman you give

me what I'm just listening raptly

okay and someone very closely matching

the description of Ajax's arch wizard

mortem walks out and he and the priest

are smiling and having wrapping up some

kind of conversation and he notices the

apple cart and it's like he's gonna it's

like it's like and more time kind of

claps his hand on the priests shoulder

and the priests kind of you know but

then that's sure yeah yeah please don't

kill me and they're gonna go buy apples

unless somebody does something okay work

the I know I don't know if we're waiting

for no wait for so I assume I assume

yeah that you're ready in action yeah

yeah you're you're sitting now stand in

the window okay so then that means its

mission okay

I need a little tape too it's not great

I got 14 just want to point out oh by

the way if my plan was to play for like

an hour and a half take a break play for

like an hour a 15 15 awesome entre 17

years so I think he has the highest so

probably want to make sure Tom goes

first

yep that's why we will use my reaction

as a it's a senior officer well yeah

standby because his things gonna happen

immediately like a sumo guy walks out

his ready to action is gonna yeah oh oh

he gets it he gets a free shot I see

okay okay and then you guys you guys

have surprised and I forget how

surprised works in fifth edition I think

consult the chat yeah I think well let

me say what I think Italy you guys have

advantage on attacks I think is what it

boils down to and I think maybe they

don't get to act but I don't member by

McKean I'm sure somebody watching knows

how it works yeah I figure I can see the

discord keeping or typing oh crap

I have ever video you guys I'll just get

a free round if I'm at okay yeah what

did you get 17

[Music]

and copper it's 2:15 I just posted it

[Music]

[Music]

did you all get your spell cards

yeah I'm looking over that well you have

a lot of spells that there's no parts

yeah that's true I was like I need spell

cards for this because uper curious I

hope people have had access to yes man

I'm really glad we're playing D&D again

yeah super glad we're doing this

I just suddenly overwhelmed with

gladness

yeah just like it's just I think the air

conditioning just kicked on so it's cool

so tis well a few water bottles are

actually also I forgot to thank Mary

McLain for the overlay this is all art

from strongholds and followers so it's

not obvious it's not themed for the

chain it's from our book I think it a

war theme for the chain did just took

that and turn it into an overlay with

some help maybe cereal death yeah lady

the lady circles original player helped

us take our our books layout and turn it

into a stream overlay which i think is

dope as hell and i'm looking at right

now and is super impressed with

how with the wall and jerry call the

animations to work and everything and

people are suggesting stuff i'm seeing

this in chat already people are saying

oh it'd be nice to see like the names on

the characters on stuff we will do all

that stuff we listen to your suggestions

this is our first stream doing this the

next one will be better and then one

you know that if anybody's still

watching you'll notice a lot of

improvements alright so I'm gonna give

you a free like you get to go okay and

then initiatives so go ahead and do what

you're gonna do copper so as my bonus to

action its yeah top o copper yeah yeah

I will use my bonus action mmm Kinari

yep okay gonna make a so perception

wisdom procession I'm gonna give you

advantage on this because he does not

know that you're there okay so I wrote

to 1919 wait nineteen-year-old 15% of

bonuses don't you have plus plus five on

your perception this would be to hit I

think so total it's always that would

mean he would have to it would work if

he were like eleventh level it's it's

weird the way he you don't seem to get

any kind of you know he sees he's

somehow moving in such a way that does

not present weak points do you can still

shoot him stay there but yeah he hasn't

made it it's confidence and started yet

so you haven't seen how he behaves in

combat so we haven't got a read on where

exactly is the best place to shoot man

okay well yes more than as far as you

know in Mortimer Xena

so yeah you can't it doesn't it doesn't

be seems like you're not getting a read

on okay I will shoot them okay here we

go yeah this is actually a pretty

standard ambush like if we were did to

the fact that this is the start of the

campaign

this is a this is kind of an embossed

your putt to shoot yeah I know I feel

like I feel like you have literally been

well you've been to the house I have to

make sure I have been nice okay we all

get to go as a tourist so he doesn't

know you're there I would say that's I

would say considering this is a surprise

attack so there's just yeah so I mean it

may be that just Kenai is something that

doesn't really become useful until

combat starts so in situation like this

well you already have a drop on them

you're a dead man okay so now I'm using

my lord arrow you're the red arrow the

red area or zone of the watch or red

arrow prompts so I have a question yes

who has those five arrows I mean you

have all five of them

I have crossbow so what I have taken one

would you give me my crossbows Firebolts

oh there you go they're called they're

just called the red arrows I have one

ever sent I'm gonna use it I feel like

maybe ego just is overkill okay I'm

gonna use one all right 21:21 well that

would serve

Stanley so at this point at this point

several things happen in rapid

succession okay yep aha we did that so

the arrow you all see the red arrow go

like a dart and smack into Morgan's

shoulder and spin him around for a

second and the Bishop of st. Clement the

gentleman freaks out and takes a step

back but then it seems almost as though

mortem changes and his cloak and his

finery start to transform almost like

there was like armor underneath it no

ward seems to go off but the process of

this armor revealing itself continues

until eventually he realized he is

literally transforming himself in front

of you and it's not morning it's

somebody else it's a brass dragon man

well that is not the right mini egg but

it's a large not literally large but

large as a Nadine D large but a huge

Dragonborn paladin brass skin so it's

not dude that's the dude that killed the

other the killed killed the King King

omens yeah yeah he's got this he's got

this kind of this black well so we all

know this but this is the guy who killed

a good king omens look at his version of

this wizard yeah there was dragon fate

Lance's of every color but he is the one

who'd be traded the others know there

was a hole there was a hole bronze

dragon flight yeah and they hate this

guy yeah oh so he's a bit like a

defector yep mmm-hmm we need to get our

buddies from the last campaign so he's

got this huge smile on his face right

and he looks right up to the window but

before anything else can happen the sun

goes out oh geez

it gets dark okay because this giant

structure Oh God it blocks out the Sun

goes and it makes a sound like it's a

it's a sound you'll never forget it

makes the sound that sound it's just

like womp and there's this massive

floating city hovering over black bottom

that is casting the shadow it takes a

couple of seconds for your eyes to

adjust and you realize all the sun's not

out it's just that we can't see it right

now

and from this floating citadel come

hundreds of giant Hawks and oh

yeah floating platforms it's hundreds

hundreds of la-5 hundreds of giant

Eagles people on them come streaming out

of this giant Citadel I mean this thing

could be as large as black bottom it's

hard to see how big it is from down here

you're just looking at the underside

with dirt and stone the roots and stuff

growing out from appearing you know

around here up here about you know what

is that 60 feet up in here is a figure

you have only heard described well holy

 wait is that Ajax I don't think

you've ever seen Ajax a invincible but

that Saint Ajax now but that certainly

matches the description he has huge

wings that beat slowly and give him the

flight that he has he is basically as

you see him yes he has blond hair he's

got blue eyes he looks kind of a philip

of macedon look to him the Cape so did

that guy yeah and as he descends this is

the cutscene by the way I apologize for

interrupt

your combat but this is the setup as he

descends everyone in the area is

overwhelmed all the citizens many of

them are cowering some of them have

fallen to their knees unsure of what's

going on the Bishop of st. clement is

looking up at ajax an AJAX sees him and

sees Mandrake and looks back at the

bishop and says again the piece that I

have sacrificed so much to bring is

disturbed he looks at the bishop and

says Bishop Ives I know you had nothing

to do with this your life will be spared

your church on the other hand and the

hawk Lords fly over in each of these

giant Hawks is carrying a massive like

super cannonball and they each just

dropped cannonball after cannonball as

you can ball and they smash into the

church and it basically disintegrates

huge pieces of masonry go flying off

pieces of glass go shattering everywhere

the buildings over here all fall apart

so just big metal bowling balls yeah but

they're like they're like they're like

they're massive yeah they're like you

know artillery fire right world war one

level artillery fire I know where did

you get these yeah explosion of people

on those two you can see if it's that

little fiber-optic stuff and let's see

he yeah just you see the church being

demolished these buildings being

destroyed and Ajax's voice seems

supernaturally loud like everybody in

this entire city block can hear him when

he speaks and as the church is

disintegrating he says rebellions are so

tedious but they must be taken seriously

and he makes a gesture with the jade Han

this is his turn he is he uses the jane

hand and the swirling vortex in fact it

looks a lot like the hunger of Heydar

except instead of cold and stars it's a

hell it's dope yeah it's a dope-ass

thing again

blues light painting hope I hope I know

that the when the stream starts there's

a whole bunch of people watching and

then over time they're like oh it's just

a bunch of nerds playing Dean I hope

they stuck I hope you stuck around for

this because I think it's a forge world

vineyard sometimes some company that

makes I think I don't member it's some

company that makes hated by our friend

blue slight pain this swirling vortex

about and he's literally like that big

opens over about you know thirty feet in

the air and from it is deposited lit up

with this huge all its fat jiggling this

giant demon you smell brimstone and fire

and you can hear for a moment as the

thing opens these howling Souls

and closes up and Ajax says realm and do

something about this William and the

demon is in the middle of eating

something intestines are going to call

hajikko okay boss mmm-hmm it's like you

got any preference and Ajax is like

dealer's choice and a creature when

someone gets to act and he's gonna

attack somebody one two three four all

sixes

I'm gonna read will sixes but I assume

I'm gonna make an executive decision one

two three four five six

well you're the commander you are the

commander I had a sea of three four well

we're not fighting this right rel we

need two reaches out and it looks almost

as though the hand that he has that has

just all these entrails itself are

wrapping around the commander I'm

starting firing as to how the applecart

business is doing I'm a simple Apple

cellar yeah

you take 40 points of damage yeah you

stole our you survived holy you

still alive alright so people are

running screaming but it's now your

actions Anna what does Judge do oh it's

my turn

yep so fYI the commander is grappled and

lifted and he's being crushed by these

entrails the twist and screw around him

and you can see his head sticking out as

one of them wraps itself around his neck

you can see one arm sticking out but he

doesn't care to have a lot of motion and

I need to get you that super glad they

were me they were made for the Wizards

though yeah that's why I'm thinking that

I don't think I'll use on anyone else

cuz it's for like the only information

we got is that they were for to take

down his boards I mean we could try it

but we got four I don't want our

contract is to kill that guy yeah like

we already lost one because it's on him

so sorry yeah some headshot was like

lieutenant there's four hit points yeah

fill your four hit points this is what

we just got from chat you are four hit

points away from a battlefield promotion

[Laughter]

and then we all rise and not interdict

that's a completely different there yes

interdict again interdict yeah interject

it means to get it means to me needs to

get in the way of something you want me

to leave I want you to because you were

so nauseous are you gonna die I probably

am going to die but I'm grappled my foot

but you are also going

also I should say that this is largely

just like body language and because this

is so quickly

yeah but also you guys know each other

so well that just a glance okay a lot

okay so so how are we gonna work this

out so yes you're gonna toss me the

thing before I do my thing well I'm

gonna get I'm gonna get the turn but I'm

good on my turn I'm going to prop and

I'm get a second wind and well what

would what would dropping I don't think

you can drop the arrow like you're

you're you'd have to break the gravel

like this thing this thing is your your

not your only only tiny parts of your

body are visible like you can let go of

it but it's not gonna fall it's wrapped

I'm gonna try something you know

so with grapple I thinking you need to

make some sort of save well yeah I mean

strap a warrior or a fighter my

precision so you could probably break

out of that yeah maybe the thing is I

think I could do something that he will

not be able to do well against boldly

that will cause him to give it a shot in

real well bless as he as he holds you in

his hand and as you twist and try to

communicate with the weapon master he

pulls you closer and says I like

officers so whenever I do my billfold

Internet yeah okay

it says it's a bonus section but I print

a spell slot with it yeah

does that mean I can do this is a better

section for my spell slot and then

actually use my real action and still

burn a spell slot to do something else

depends on what that something else is

probably okay I just want like in a

single turn I'm very multiple spells

yeah there's no there's no research in

there

you can't cast multiple spells but there

are resources you can burn spells lots

of different things okay so what I'm

gonna do first is as a bonus action is

it whenever says price spells what is it

always just a first level spells or does

it take you so few usually like you can

do to make it stronger or something

anyway this is a little different it

works basically like a paladin's divine

smite they stuff like that okay got it

okay so I'm spell slot to place a seal

on relic yeah that'll be there okay so

one of the things I was gonna have liked

but hey this guy's way too big for that

usually a magnetic disks usually is and

put them under the miniature but yeah so

you put a seal on this guy yeah okay

it's a symbol I think only you can see

yeah

so I'm gonna do that and then as my cool

action I'm going to cast or no actually

it's not even a cast it's just it's my

invoke authority that I can do get some

architect of ruin you are different

experts and tell them you jinx

me so I choose a target so I choose

brogue

if they're Curt's compel the credulous

so if their charisma is less than mine

they must make a wisdom save and if they

feel that say if they attack their

closest ally if they're Christmas equal

to or higher than mine their ability has

no effect I believe that their wisdom

saved is against my my spell DC probably

okay

we haven't what my printer does print

double-sided by the way well you just

have to know you have to know that hey

and you have to know how to do it but

yeah okay so he needs to make a wisdom

save of 16 okay

he does he does huh

how can he be so wise he is an extra

planer Demon Lord he has super high

stats sighs is he just rolled like all

of Matt's deeds I don't think you can

let go of it but it's not clear that

it's gonna drop anywhere it's just gonna

get lost in in the entrails of whatever

extra plane or creature he was pieces on

am I am i within like if I move am I

gonna invoke opportunity where are you

can't even see where you are at the

pillar of weight where the church was

between was uh how you don't think so

cuz he's currently grappling Lars

oh no yeah you might from Ajax no not

from Ajax okay but you're not you're

you're not close enough for rel to do it

okay in that case I'm gonna scream Tom

do you want to just move me towards you

guys up six squares that's out of town

this way that way or those welcome to

the applecart game hahaha

Oh Yankee he might get ya opportunity

yeah what are the guards doing right now

well it's not they're actually up but

they're freaking actually that mean

kickball initiative for them mm-hmm who

is it freaking out at this point well

you know what this is the apocalypse

wait did you just run right past dragon

dude I'm sorry I got the initiative

screwed up tonight I got the initiative

yeah Anna does not have a shitty nails

my first I will fix that door yeah did I

remember haps the dragon guy in that was

the dragon I'm gonna whack me okay

yeah Mandrake will get a free attack on

you if you run costume okay I guess

either you have to run past him or the

big guy are you gonna run past them well

you already used your action okay so use

your bonus action that was the thing I

just say it against that was no that was

the seal okay he's gonna steal on cry

okay I was gonna I was trying to find a

way if it user actually to disengage but

yeah I use action to try and do the

thing to UM make him attack an ally okay

why don't you go this way and you're not

gonna get a tax opportunity I mean I

guess that's true yeah I could go that

way instead and then try to get up into

the building

oh man I mean we know we're pretty sure

that that's that guy the sword looks

like it he's gonna your day up okay

so I was here yes

I have an airplane mode I need to turn

it off

I'm know if I like I've always found

that especially in this day and age

especially if it's not you're turning

this in combat and it's late and people

are just like what use their phone to

check Stanford right right now I just

looked up what up ocean of climbing did

yeah look things like that my friend

Brian like is watching and he sent me

like a million texts so that was

supposed to be so what happened was Tom

was supposed to go first and he wasn't

supposed to go first aha and then judged

it so I screw that up I apologize I'll

figure out this teeny game one of these

days so for some sort of CeCe I'm sorry

did you move I I didn't the other way

yeah cuz I don't want to but I don't get

that opportunity from the bronze dragon

board good nails it too well all I could

think to do is like I mean I'm not gonna

be able to the best I could do is like

maybe irritate him enough to like turn

around I think she's gonna try and kill

both of us

crowd control I have fear oh but I don't

imagine that I can make a demon afeard

of me just remember the light or you can

double booked it yeah if you if you use

your action right and then you one of

the things you can do with your action

is you can convert your movement into

movement that doesn't provoke a tax

opportunity so if you need to get out

and you need to run past somebody who

might otherwise be able to black you you

need to use your action to make sure

that does that make sense so that's what

just happened to Hannah what just happen

Ana was she wanted to grunt past

Mandrake and but she was like well he's

gonna get an attack of opportunity on me

because I can't run past him without and

ignore him right and in order to run

past him and the defensive buzzer do it

takes her action and she'd already use

direction

so that's the trade-off is you can try

something but then if it fails whether

it succeeds or fails if you want to move

past any of these people they might get

a free attack on you gotcha this is

actually he's selling apples pants I'm

selling apples now he's now he's

drumming animals in the soil drawers

business but it turns out it's a

seller's market all right well let's see

I realized this Hobson's choice well I'm

wondering is do our guys

so so I think I think I'm and I

think we did not worry about me and if

you know playing in character I think

that would be the thing so what I'm

gonna do now is because I had my bow out

intending to shoot I don't know if

Matt's gonna let me do this but I'm

gonna actually try to shoot into where

Thomas so Tom can recover the arrow and

leave I don't know if it's gonna work

after it's been shot once but I don't

see what else we got

I can use my Hobbit you know what else

we're gonna do with it and I can use my

action shirt to heal a little bit but he

just did 40 points of damage to me so

even if you throw it like here I can I'm

gonna go downstairs yeah we'll see we'll

see on my turn where I might do it but

that's all I can thank you well you're

gonna want to try for a treat from the

graphics but that's gonna take my action

so I see

since our thing is we complete the

contract you're right I should try I

need to get that back to you guys

because you she hasn't really liked

charisma she just blew it on that tom is

also for this but he can't do anything

you could try to shoot him but I don't

think we're gonna kill this guy at level

5 the job was to kill um more than the

warden or to thank you guys immortal and

we got our job yep and I'm so

playing a character if I can hit him

with fear and succeed he will drop you

that'd be awesome

what's the safer here is it wisdom

wisdom

he is a really good wisdom like my

that's good that's good money means it

was like a 20% chance anybody could say

yeah so I mean it depends how it rolls I

mean you get you're activating your

movement you're not that far from off

the board so you're actually yeah like

you're five or six will get you off the

board so you could do it then book it it

is worth a shot yeah I'm going to you

might be an arranger yeah I'm gonna move

well if you do that you're not able to

get out of there

what laura's is kind of planning your

movement yeah and he's saying if you

want to move your max movement that way

to get out then just stay then spending

ten feet moving that way won't get you

off the map in other words if you move

ten feet that way to cast the spell you

won't have enough movement left over to

get off the map as well our society well

you get close enough to try and cast

this so don't you go for walk right in

front of but I can go there and then I

can I can split move and attack and I

can we actually got together I think you

were here with this we got together with

Tom and just ran a couple danger about

calls because he's never little went

great

okay I was like okay Tom don't you get

your ass kicked I mean technically yes

yeah like also yeah yes it was super

useful he thinking some stuff out and

learn how to use the spells and learn

some tactics and stuff I have not been

using thirty Jerry am i safe to use the

the players thing to change in issues

and stuff it could be one back if you

want sure okay thirty oh sorry I'm

counting him no you're right yeah I'm

mistaken if I hate your comes are

schmuck okay I can run initiative from

here and having that change and since

I'm the one that calls initiative anyway

so you're gonna cast a spell great yeah

I sneak up behind him and I gaze at his

humongous warty ass

phrase over me and I can tell it to fear

me okay go ahead and make a second mark

off the spell oh what's the DC 15 it was

worth a shot

yeah do you what what do you have

movement left I do have my left - you

look ugly so that's five ten fifteen to

get forty work you were here right yeah

we're here

20 25 30 and it is hey your grapple

should I just like I'm not gonna I mean

I'm I'm one of the senior officers here

I'm not just gonna drop drop these guys

panic this guy tries to panic and falls

on his ass nice this guy panics the

applecart someone starts trying to drag

his car his oxen have run but he's

trying to pull slowly pull his apple

cart from what's happening and you know

the hawk Lords are continuing to bomb

the city they haven't stopped

oh they're bombing the city okay I'm not

just bombing no yeah well rebellions are

you know tedious but they have to be

yeah all we did was shoot an arrow at

that guy yeah and he's wrecking the

whole city because of that well seems a

bit suspicious Wow well maybe we were

set up over let's see it's like somebody

calling you poopoo head and then you

I mean look look at this cape

dude he's obviously how dare you

those are fighting creases no one calls

me that part of this cave yeah you

should be on your turn shouldn't i five

be king

certainly my emperor of the world no

what's that I said look at that guy

shouldn't he be the Emperor world yeah

he definitely thinks he deserves a

Warhammer many isn't it I think it is

but it's got it's got a unique head in a

unique hand I think yeah but it is a it

is a straight-up there was somebody in

shirt was but somebody and Chad went

during a hex dream I was talking about

getting a I described what Ajax looked

like and I got a whole bunch of really

good suggestions and this was I want to

get like a 75 millimeter mini and just

to make them look like right it wouldn't

be to scale but to impress people but

yeah I think that's that is literally

what Ajax looks like like he looks like

a noble leader his blond hair blue eyes

he looks like you know the hero of the

people not these people these people are

all going to die but but some people

some great all right so that will come

oh I'm covered big guy so I'm gonna move

and I don't know how much I can move

with Wow that's the same I can see you

gonna use your for now no this one turns

out to be a bad idea you're gonna use a

mouse move it

so basically actually I think we make an

animal handling check me and Anna

Landing check and you can command your

mount to move its movement and that's

your movement okay I didn't know if

there's a Oh Carter something there's

yes he has to make a check to have his

animal key while he's riding his annal

he has basically like a riding check and

it doesn't take an action right but if

he's not if he's not in tune with his

animal then it's only gonna move 30 feet

which is but if he's if he's being a

good writer if he's kind of good at

being a ranger

Pet dude and then he will get his pets

full movement which is 60 feet nice

which is quite a lot and if you fail

they just don't movers no no no if you

fail you just move through you got it

okay the question is are you good enough

are you a good skilled enough

to be able to what you said off

yeah uh best ranger alright okay

or was it hey hey hey hey I'll try this

dice against you in NY and the couple

does looks like a it's not hard it's not

nine nine is not good you look at 30

feet of movement and you're right in

your back um how do i how do you get up

from there yeah well you have a couple

of options you can either have big cat

leap right out of the window which in

your experience would be no problem for

big cat Oh bacon has six legs they are

you could try to go backwards down the

stairs and get out the front door or

they door yeah with a side door which

would be probably the rest of your

movement and then some no I'll jump if

it's if he's if it's I guess if he's he

can he's like a cat he can hit make a

safe or not okay absolutely does does

does he have any skills probably not

he's but creatures have creatures have

skills like people proficiencies so it's

same like the middle section Tom after

the stats after the list of stats where

it says strength X underneath that would

say skills if there were dark vision

passive person okay so go se go ahead

and make go ahead and make a yeah go

ahead make a dex check and add +3 to it

okay yeah plus we could get some mercury

in 25 min in the sea what if they're

weighted 28 no problem yeah so you're

able to you're able to leap out of the

where do you want to win right here yeah

no problem no problem okay senior

officers of the chain you all see Connor

odd big cat come bursting out and

and just like a you know a cat always

lands on its feet and the tentacles are

waving and because and then I'm gonna

move this way all right you move you

move that way and as you as this thing

slinks along its legs don't seem to be

moving very quickly but it's got six of

them almost like a spider and as it goes

by realm it turns us did you have a cat

he rides around so you make your cat I

don't question your apparently you can't

quite the checkbook copper at mercury it

would dissolve it that would be a

terrible way to find out

thank God for chat letting me know you

can't put copper mercury because how do

you like is this way definitely not it's

now a liquid when I when I bought it on

the little description it says like one

of the questions was will turn green

after boxes copper yes yes it well so

you know what they say about their any

pennies where those have been so I'm not

quite done no don't you have another

view an action or if you want yeah you

have you have three more red arrows time

I feel like they told specifically this

is for excuse me that's my emotional

support displace of these this is

working great I can't tell if these are

comments from chat or their from the

moderators but I love getting the

getting the comments from chat it's my

emotional support displacive basin I'm

not gonna use my arrow I think I'm

trying snaring strike to stop him from

moving did we specifically need all of

these arrows I mean we got game is five

we got we got that one in four states

Isaiah five bullets and once we're out

of those bullets we're and we

can't complete the job when they took

the job you know was a half work with

them and the half work said that five

arrows was a waste of Oreos because they

were only gonna get much that sounds

like Nicodemus

yeah five boroughs is a waste of forums

cuz you only get one shot well so no I

don't think we should know all right I'm

wondering now if I should try because we

got one leg has one in his bot in his

shoulder oh it actually wound him no

because he was smile and after

he got hit based on the description

okay but it's like in I'm still yeah

okay it's probably like the if you know

their true name thing and it's edge

tonic or something I think he's just

using disguise self or something you

probably like anticipated like the

wizard real wizard probably can't risk

going out like on his own so they

probably just send somebody who they

know can like you know shouldn't

shut up if he gets attacked yeah I mean

you could get a shot off far away what

you were gonna

oh yeah um I guess he's probably pretty

strong it's a strength save I mean I

think he did 40 damage to me so yeah I

don't think I'm stuck starin i KITT just

gonna be a waste

yeah you might as well that's right if I

gotta lose the body it's a bad guy in

like 16 that is correct that's pretty

typical Matthew 100% I'm a big believer

in recycling

I recycle all the PCs and the bad guys

some of those bad guys are still kicking

our ladies are still kicking around

I use my bonus action I take an apple

like the tentacles reach out a new piece

grab one apple and one tentacle ferries

it up to you yeah yeah cats don't like

apples all right that was a Tom it's now

a little transaction oh you've gotta get

used to do this through

I don't know first stream who dis look

at this figured out tell me how the Java

love lightning works yeah somebody throw

it you're gonna burn it like you're not

gonna get it back so yeah when you throw

it it turns into a bolt of lightning

bases yeah but if then it's gonna stick

into something and we don't recover it

it's gone I think you can throw it and

not say the command word and then it's

just normal javelin but otherwise if you

throw it and say the command word it

turns into I'm just doing this from

memory it turns into a lightning bolt

okay do it but you do have to physically

recover it it's not like magic no

correct when you early enough the

command transforms only buliding five

feet wide hundred twenty feet long each

creature the line so it can affect many

people must make a very reasonable DC 13

Dec save and take 46 lightning half as

much on a safe it turns back into a

javelin we were used as the target you

make a ranged weapon attack on a hit

counts as a magic also might kill the

commander it doesn't you said it was

five feet you said it was five feet wide

Boston Oviedo says the lar should play

the applecart I mean it's not it's not

it's indiscriminate damage right I mean

could potentially kill the cow like why

is my skin feeling worried I was like oh

that's not really my skin that's why I

got the other thing because my hands

just got destroyed by building that

house anyway like we would we would try

to save the captain yeah I don't I don't

think that's the case I think please we

complete the job but like you say

company man but that's again that's not

I mean I'm the only one here to read the

black company but that's not the contest

and he tries to give you know drop off

the chest somewhere they can get it but

he's and he you know he does what

he can but he's and he crashes

that magic carpet then he dies but I

have four health I'm grappled by this

thing Ajax is right here

the night's right there mm-hmm

like you're not dead yet yep you're

right I have four hit points but I mean

we were in your experience does the

lieutenant leave people behind

in my experience the lieutenant

completes the job and the job is done

here well he can't get your yeah no I

mean I drop my dude doesn't leave people

behind

if you read my backstory you'd know that

that's your action

come get me dude I'm just trying to

think of what I mean I think the javel

javelin of lightning is a chance to drop

it mm mm you uh I mean I might be

sacrificing it well I can recover if you

know these guys you brought up two

infested buttcrack yes face it right at

me in real life well there's no there's

no there's no facing in D&D so we could

turn them around if you haven't seen the

Magister you we're just talking about

character can I can I is it a religion

check is like being a tiefling

I want to Knievel's I want to kind of

get an idea like if this guy's up

killing the commander like do we have

some to worry about like is he

gonna try and like you know resurrect

him against this kind of thing yeah that

would definitely be a religion sir okay

fourteen it's certainly I mean they'll

have the commander's soul baking them

yeah and what if somebody else kills

well that's a good question I don't

think I don't think this you don't

you're if you roll higher you might get

a clear answer but for what you rolled I

think that

you know certainly if this demon kills

the commander then if this demon kills

the commander then they're gonna have

the commander soul and what they do with

that you're not sure but they can use it

to fuel things they might be able to use

it to bring him back and make him a tall

they might learn everything the

commander knows about the about the

chain well that kind of but you don't

know that bill right actually a judge

could explain that talking takes no time

but it's up to you whether or not yes

what would judge what would judge chain

sign to the lieutenant like kill

commander save soul it's up to up to

Phil have a lieutenant enter what's that

I think that's this is do I know this is

not the done thing but this is

cool yeah my guys been around like he's

been around you can have other planes

and you've been doin to the world below

so I don't think I mean he's not gonna

just be like oh that's right

absolutely knows that kind of stuff can

have yeah Plus judge is kind of the

local expert on fiends and demonology

and stuff like that like judge is a

paladin of Asmodeus right so a judge

talks about it yes yeah judge judge is a

paladin of Asmodeus yes so then so

looking at this guy yeah I just got a

link to the TV Tropes shoot the hostage

I don't know I don't know I mean I think

I don't think my character would expect

that we could kill this thing all right

no but might you try to do whatever you

could desperately right well I'm trying

to I'm thinking okay so based on the

circumstances what would be what would

he think is the most prudent thing to do

right would it be to kill the commander

so he doesn't get his soul eaten by a

demon was it yeah or like try to hurt

the demon but you guys haven't even

heard the demon yet

I mean the only chance there is is that

möhippa demon and somehow he drops the

guy yeah well you're just even if you

hit me with the Lightning you're just

gonna knock me unconscious you're not

gonna doing it you have to do it's like

what three times my hip points to kill

me how much boys doing right now or

what's your maximize 44 he'd have to do

48 hit points oh geez so basically the

the only thing I can really is for the

javelin atom and hope that he drops them

if you if you javelin the commander and

the commander went unconscious mmm a lot

of creatures a lot of creatures stop

attacking unconscious things to focus on

the threat you played aiming for yeah

but I mean this dude probably just eaten

I'm glad everybody like their retainers

a bundle said cuz you're gonna get to

play with yeah I mean I'm thinking that

that like out of desperation I'm gonna

I'm with three javelin who you javelin

I'm gonna throw it at the demon okay to

try and get him to drop its bite be

quiet is the lightning bolt is that what

it said yeah this might be wide in 120

feet long

yeah I mean I should you can definitely

angle it upwards if you want to avoid

hitting other people and I mean if you

have enough movement you could maybe try

to hit both well to end now I mean I'd

have to get I have to get over here I

would use all my movement to get over

there people want high-res photos of the

minis and we will provide them yeah

that's because we're incredibly happy

with the work that blues like being did

although I might be able to move to the

side and catch they're like this

way yeah they're the ruins of the church

Dragonborn what's it oh that's mandarin

man

Mandrake the betrayer he was the captain

of the bronze dragon flight not the best

train here so we got Morton and Mandrake

he likes ends well I mean things I mean

yeah I mean this feels like one of the

end Lars is also playing all right so

how many spaces would I have to move to

be able to get Mandrake and and big

sloppy in the line you're pretty much

you're gonna hit them so 30 feet I mean

you have to get you want steam engine

yeah you'd have to get like here stay in

a line actually actually no you could do

it from here if you stood here no no no

they're not at me they're not they're

not yeah they're not unfortunately

they're just far enough apart that one 5

foot wide line could not get both of

them just keeps going it's literally

like a 46 lightning man can I get up in

them and look yeah don't have anything

yeah yeah I think most of the rest of us

are used to it from code names but yeah

when you lean and you forget whatever

you start to back out so this one see

the mods are doing amazing or so are we

talking the base yeah I gotta hit the

any of these squares if you can

intersect if you can inspect any so any

square that the base touches so

basically I need to get here I'm

thinking yeah that would do it sure what

did you this is also gonna pass priest

Oh

hey Jack specifically said I knew yeah

but he's consorting is consorting with

the enemy

alright so then I guess what I got to do

is I'm gonna try and hit well they

actually you just say yes it's just 46

are you I'm right here yeah oh it

doesn't stick into rel just keep it all

you aiming at rel no well actually

that's a good question my guess is it

turns into a lightning bolt and then I

think it falls to that then he

I really hope I get us booking area I'm

gonna roll 20 damage do I don't get to

add my stream oh no I told a lie it

doesn't really work like a lightning

bolt so but you know what'll happen is

it'll it'll I'm gonna make a ruling it's

gonna embed in Ralph's okay so he's the

target so it's gonna go zap zap zap

anybody in anybody between you and

relegates gonna zap and then stop it

oh you hit somebody do I get why I don't

I don't die I probably don't have my

strength to that since I didn't have to

roll javelins or javelins uh no because

there's a spell no what you're doing is

you're basically will launching a fire

okay

I got 20 damage you hit a target that I

have a seal on I'm gonna go ahead assume

the seal and I rolled 26 damage I do 28

between the two of us okay maybe I'll

drop the captain normally I have you

guys track damage to bad guys but in

this case this guy has so many hit

points yeah you noticed the javelin arch

into our candlelight butt cheek and

there's like a little and a little like

black scorch mark on it since he doesn't

say no I mean appears to have worked

it's just this is a huge demon okay a 46

lightning bolt is not enough to him he

gotta be reaches around with his giant

axe or any kind of scratches his ass boy

there's something poking at me does he

drop the c'mere did-did-did chump you

take any damage man Drake man Drake

saved into a calf damage okay so he took

ten

I had the priest deal my with with my

actually I don't think he was yes he is

is I think you have no using priests he

does not make his saving throw he was

badly wounded and falls to the ground

but he seems just to be like it seems to

be mostly cowering Phil so the

lieutenant throws this javelin it turns

into a lightning bolt it arcs it hits

the bishop knocks him down he seems

alive but unwilling to get up it

scorches Mandrake's face and causes them

to turn away and embel embeds into realm

causing a slight tremor in relics and

that is that is the it's the push your

arm through meat and blood okay so I'm

gonna fire this way

so you can make an acrobatics check or

enough actually I think that would be an

action and you just took your action

quick oh no I did second one that's

opposed Robbie you're gonna fire the I'm

gonna fire there that's gonna be your

action yeah but I'm a little five eight

two attacks dos attacks por favor

so I can at least uh I can at least make

way down yeah that's interesting you can

still make it you can still make a

regular attack with a javelin because it

can do its damage in addition to the

lightning damage that's right because

whenever I used to using your rope

javelin damage and the easy it's easy

Christmas thing it's as big as a house

so you roll 4d or way number of javelins

damages roll twice

your strength once 26 so it's just a

virus

oh you don't get to re-roll it it's just

that instead of one it's just - yeah

that's what I create this no no a critic

written is just you roll the weapon down

you roll your damage again okay are the

damages you roll it again I think that's

javelin is just visits judge so

critically javelin is just 36 and you

have a weapon that's 1 d6 I see yeah you

have a weapon master so like when you

when you were passing out the treasure

when Judge handed the javelin to you

judges like hey I can sharpen sharpen

sharpen sharpener Katanga ice little bit

sharper than also that's for plus my

strength which is crazy so 9 damage so

he has 30 negative got it got ya the

javelin sticks in him thank you for chat

for crack event

mind you I think this javelin lightnings

about to off to the interval so do

I need to roll to fire the arrow over

here

or uh do you need to roll the fire the

arrow over there yeah you're a fifth

level experienced soldier commander of

the chain so we can ask strapless I have

a second attack in a while can I use my

second attack with a different weapon or

is that one uh yeah does counts as part

of your anywhere I'm gonna try stab them

in the eye okay what am i two-handed

sword and that's not gonna be hit twice

14:14 it's huge

like it's it's hard it's almost

impossible to miss damage okay actually

when you hit with a weapon attack expend

one superiority die and attempted to

storm the target that's probably I might

as well yeah you're the drop one I have

your choice that it's holding hey there

it is a superior died of damage role and

the target must make the strength saving

throw is probably gonna build a few

drops the object so that's a not is that

the one is that the max that is the max

so seventeen wait 17 more damage it's

now 17 DC ODC 17 drink strength god oh

well sorry you struggled people eat

unable to unable to get him to releases

there's a lot of folks because you know

I've this I didn't write these rules and

so I'm sort of making stuff up on the

fly as we go

like really animal handling just fine

like that and as long as it seems fair

and makes sense to me then we can

revisit stuff afterwards it's pretty

typical look stuff up after the game and

figure I has this work so does the stop

the game but we have if you want to talk

about the rules and how how terrible I

am an implemented

I believe we have a whole separate sub

channel just for rules discussion which

we created on purpose I think it's a

room in the chat which we created on

purpose for people to go talk about rule

stuff and thereby leave the main chat

for discussion of the story so it's like

yeah rules complaint room

well yeah that's true you know people

people who have invested a lot of time

into learning the rules want to show off

that they know the rules

and I completely respect that and we and

I like to play by the rules that's the

reason I want to have chat available so

when we do stuff wrong they could be

like oh you're trying to sound but it's

more like if I make a ruling on the fly

and it's it's not according to the rules

that's no problem we'll just go back

later in the next game and I'll do right

yeah that's the process of learning the

game and that's something any DM should

be comfortable doing are you done so

that's the yeah okay cool all right well

let's see I have we are going to cut to

back to the cinematic because it is now

a Jackson realms turn all boy huh so you

notice now at this point that either

because of Ajax or realms presence there

are demons coming out of doors and

windows chasing people out of their

homes and you see members of the chaîne

like you see angel fall out or jump out

of a second-story tavern window and land

on his feet and

this spike demon sticks his head out and

angel who is not completely dressed is

hurling daggers at it and stabbing in

the eye and driving it back and does

this halfling turns and sees what's

going on and it's down that alleyway so

I don't think I don't know I think maybe

judge can see him in terms of judges

people are running screaming all the

normal citizens are freaking out huh can

I sign back to the angel sure actually

you see cook come bursting out of the

double doors of the same tavern and with

a giant meat cleaver and cook sees you

so I think I signed to him because they

both can see me right they're both sent

me the message so I think I signed a Jax

here commander truck commander in

trouble yeah well with you with you in

his hand realm

turns to a Jackson says just this one

boss and a jack says no no kill them all

so as a jack says that he kind of floats

forward and you notice all the fog on

the ground starts to kind of move and

swirl it seems as though it's making a

vortex centered on AJAX rainbows no no

no he doesn't even seem to notice it it

swirls and rotates and took into this

kind of like little whirlwind a little

tiny tornado spinning white tornado with

that the fog whips around almost like

cloth it becomes so solid that the cloth

is spinning this thing that was once fog

and a figure materializing

oh you may need a camera on that yeah a

beautiful elven I don't think any of

your you two have seen this character

before the rest of you have not this is

the woman you met last night and she is

very pale elven skin unnaturally pale

bright resumix bloodshot eyes and she

has she pulls from the robes of her

dress this ornate elven sword that is

quite obviously valuable and almost

certainly very powerful are any of you

none of you guys are elves or have any

kind of familiarity with millennia or

probably I speak elvish I mean I did

grab an owie

that's true but you didn't grow up like

a mirror Pannell for that yeah she takes

this sword and plunges it into a Jax's

back or worse or she would get

him but Ajax at the last minute steps

aside the sword misses him by an inch

and he grabs it with the Jade and using

the Jade hand he grabs a Ryan and pushes

ladies Ariel down like he's trying to

force her to kneel yeah

and he says to Lady cereal he has a

smile on his face like like this is the

thing he was waiting for and he says

your father kneeled to me and lived

because he knew this is an age of men

and he moves to clench his fist and

ladies Ariel unyielding not forced to

unlike her father who was mortal she is

a vampire Lord and she is strong enough

to resist she does not go to her knees

she pulls out a second elven artifact

sword

Ajax clenches his fist and Orion the

Master Sword detonates Wow ladies Ariel

the vampire the vampire queen her flesh

starts to shred and disintegrate as the

energy from the sword is released and

she howls in pain and frustration and it

echoes throughout the city and the

explosion from the destroyed sword turns

her body into a vapor and it blows away

holy cow there is a detonation of this

energy this opalescent energy that rises

up into the sky that fills the air and

kind of chorus gates across the land and

looking up seeing the stuff in the sky

the camera pans down and the camera and

now it is cut seeing that we are looking

we are looking at a forest and in the

forest our three carts and there's a

handful of what looked like normal

peasant Carter's it's dark here wherever

this is and they are looking up at the

sky and they see this energy wash across

the sky and panning into the third cart

going inside there's a woman recumbent

lying in the cart she has a gold skin

she has a white hair and she has our

glasses for eyes and she's she's awake

she seems like she's suffering from like

some kind of sickness like what we would

expect somebody would like to Buerkle

osis to have and her face is kind of

twisted in depression and sadness and

she says Sariel you and life

leaves her body and her eyes turn back

to normal normal eyes and her body ages

like a thousand years and slowly

collapses in the cart and then we're

almost done and then

as though waking from a nightmare is

another woman who sits on a throne in

what looks like a mausoleum and like

ladies cereal she's human but likely to

Cyril she has pale white skin and red

lips and bloodshot eyes and she's like

she just was sleeping and was awoken by

some horrible vision and she looks

around her mansion this dead lady who

rules over a dead City and says ladies

organ and this black sucked manifests

immediately into the figure of a lady

Knight with this heavy armor big badass

sword

huge helm you can see her face and she

is filled with hatred being here ladies

organ says my lady and this woman says

the game has begun bring me the book and

lady's organ kind of sneers she doesn't

like whatever compulsion is on her that

forces her to obey and she says by your

command

and then realm use this a special attack

against a creature I can't you can't go

home and play Kingdom Hearts he's gonna

know my soul but you could pick up my

weight like all that the cinematic stuff

you guys didn't see we didn't see it

I rolled that fancy one okay yeah you

can only do this to somebody who's

already grabbed I hope that all of those

have like numbers on them it or not

can't display your happiness oh yeah the

old numbers funny I don't think I have

any eggs that are pips Oh Dean states oh

don't you boys stay around for well wait

I can do the second one

oh no that's right I have 13 you take 68

points what's your total points 44 44 so

you go what' Richard what we're at 12 I

was at 13

that's over 44 are you through 48 you

said so it's 50 oh yeah go you're dead

Phil nice ear

[Applause]

oh hang on to this because realm starts

eating your dead body but put the

commander his head into his jaws and rip

you see the sinew of the commander is

neck stretches his head pops off he

starts squeezing the commander and

drinking its blood taki takes no time

Thank You blues we're about to take a

break we're about to take a break

because about to run on a hard drive

space and then we'll come back and

probably 10 minutes 10 minutes 15

minutes does the does the new commander

have any kind of announcement or order

I'd like to before we go and break

before we go yeah you're in charge now

you're in charge now sweet I think we

need to get the out of Dodge that

sounds reasonable be back here look be

back at about 10-15 minutes thanks

I have a button labeled we're back so

hopefully now yeah well this is a

conversation by the way that we should

have welcome back I guess something I

want to point out was this dope-ass

table that we have the I bought even

before with us we had the Kickstarter is

from Rathskeller and I feel like it's

doing pretty good so thanks to the folks

at grass Keller's it's not an ad or

product endorsement or anything I just

like their table also largely there's a

reason for one event announced because

we have a whole bunch of people in our

community who are super awesome and who

regularly gift subscriptions and I think

at least some of them they explained

that like it's because this is the only

way we have to like give you money

besides to support your content besides

our own five-dollar subscription or the

strongholds in followers book so I have

you know we've created a patreon you

know a patreon at patreon /mc DM I think

there are two levels five and ten

dollars a month and we will come up with

some rewards I don't know what off the

top my head but I just wanted to because

like twitch takes half of your

subscriptions which I understand they've

got a business to run but I wanted to

give those few people who wanted to give

us more money the opportunity the

opportunity to do that because that

keeps the giving and a lot of money off

the Kickstarter but that money is gonna

run out and it's revenue that is gonna

keep the doors open

ultimately so we do have a we do have a

patreon and also people who have Amazon

Amazon Prime get a free twitch

subscription that they can that they can

throw to a streamer once a month and

they can they have to manually do it

each month but if you link your Amazon

your twitch accounts those of us those

of you who've been following my new hack

streams already know this you can

subscribe with a twitch Prime free

doesn't cost you anything and we get

some money so that is going to help keep

the doors open and the lights on and you

know we'll be playing D&D either way

make awesome content who knows what were

we talking about before we went on break

I sent me gonna get the out of

Dodge yeah know how so so I want so like

I was asking Lars are you going to are

you gonna roll new stats I said you

could just use I think I know if you saw

this but Lars is like hey that's that's

 I literally only got to play

this dude for one round he's dead I'm

not gonna roll new stats okay well I

don't know I don't regret your stats are

so if you want to roll and thereby maybe

get better stats you can do that but

then you start with what you get or if

you want to keep what you rolled because

your character adds actually life

expectancy as it turned out of about two

rounds then go ahead and do that and he

said he was thinking about playing

actually has a okay my retainer he has a

retainer these are in order to Simba

I think somebody already know this an

order to simulate the idea that the

chain is a mercenary company and these

are just the senior officers and there

are junior officers and then a whole

bunch of people soldiers and we're using

the retainer rules from strongholds and

followers so King is one of the

retainers and I didn't think they're

necessarily needed to be a direct

correlation between the player creating

the retainers and then running it these

are just the junior officers in the

chain but king is the one retainer that

Lars made King is an exorcist and that's

where we left this you don't know what

kind of cleric Kings gonna turn into but

if you want to you can run and we will

just assume that King is a king as a

fifth level cleric of some sort but

there could be combat coming up in which

case we're not actually gonna know what

his stats are and a third level retainer

will not survive that combat okay gonna

play okay so King is gonna stick around

with the other retainers who are some of

the junior officers of the chain are all

looking to the new commander and the

commander he said we got to get the

out of Dodge but how does the commander

express that all right so all right so

black bottom is a port city correct and

they're destroying black bottom yes

like the whole city I sparked me you

can't see the whole city but like but

you can see the hawk Lords are flying

around kind of doing their thing yeah

yeah okay where what direction what

direction is that's see here but their

erection is the harbour that way that's

not all right and who is closest

it's this way all right so at this point

yeah go ahead if you like because the

realm is not particularly interested in

which people he attacks or yes and Ajax

is gloating over the death of a serial

so at this point if you guys want to

retreat you can and you can get out of

this combat but then what you do next is

up to you like I said I don't I don't I

don't think we can beat this this guy

and like there's demons all over the

city

yeah it's not gonna be poor scattered to

the wind you can see that what there are

members of the chaîne there are soldiers

in the chain they're the the chain has

about if you guys were fighting an army

you would have about three units of

infantry maybe one of those units would

be special like sappers or Scouts or

something like that these guys are

taking heavy morale hits right now

people members of the chain I've seen

the commander died was dead run and it

looks as though this is gonna be around

alright so where's the Chronicle The

Chronicle is with this guy King is the

Chronicle and where is he he is you know

on one of these streets the the

retainers are always gonna be like one

encounter behind you guys alright so

they're gonna follow you and they're

gonna go and they're gonna do what you

say but they are trying to they're the

junior officers they're trying to stop

the rest of the chain from completely

disintegrating in Salvage at least one

unit of soldiers so you guys are always

going to kind of be one step ahead of

them they will follow you all right so

all chained here or there's about 360

soldiers they actually call themselves

that look like only recently they

started

this probably won't last much longer but

they call themself days because it's

about how many days around the year they

call themselves the calendar they

thought they were starting all UNIX

months but that was that was just them

being clever and there was no way three

all 360

alright so Anna's character is closest

to the heart so what I'm thinking is

that you need to get to the harbor

commandeer ship even if you go if like

are there any kind there might be I

don't know I don't know your career

retainers well there might be retainers

who would be good at right but they're

not here no they're I mean they're

really they're there one encounter

behind you guys so when you guys get to

wherever you're going they if there's a

battle there they won't be in the battle

but when that battle is over cuz never

battled might last if a long battle

might last 30 sites well obviously I

mean I think we're not gonna be far

behind

her carrot Anna's character but I mean

we're over here we can't we're not gonna

be able to take that road right we're

gonna take a different Road we have to

go around or sorrow this way don't don't

worry about me I can definitely use my

looks or maybe you scare the

somebody where's the Treasury actually I

don't know who the treasurer is right

now I don't know if you selected one but

if you guys where are you trying to get

to the Harbor the dots to get okay and

so get out of the Treasury to be with

two-shoes sure just go ahead just so the

way the Treasury works is it's literally

a giant box full of gold and gems and

it's a it's a giant lockbox it takes at

least two people to carry it to strong

people and so the it's got a size how

much gold is in it measured by a d6 and

anything you could buy has a rating of

like you know a suit of armor might be a

1 right

buying a galleon might be a 6 right like

we did we need to pay off a prince that

might be a six and so depending on what

you're using the Treasury for that would

either

the dye or if it's cheap enough if the

treasury's currently like a six and what

you want to buy is a one if you wouldn't

even need to do anything you can just

afford it and you get it and somebody

with a really high charisma couldn't

negotiate and try to get the cost level

of something down one I don't think we

had said negotiate but just the two

shoes can two shoes can definitely be

the treasure for out and maybe forever

alright so then you're the

standard-bearer right I've got a guy who

might know a guy a guy who might know

again is it when your retainers yes

boots boots all right well I mean oh

yeah the dualist yeah that makes it yeah

so what I want I think I wanted to do is

I want I want copper to book it on his

done big cat catch up with Hannah right

or with judge judge will get us a ship

you can you know use the Treasury don't

use it all try you know if if if copper

catches up to him then when you get to

the ship you can raise the standard so

that all of our guys know as many of our

guys as we can

yeah know where to go are you

communicating what your goal is to the

junior officers and yes yeah I'm

probably using chain sign really okay

it's as much well I mean because I don't

want those guys to hear overdoing

alright fair enough

we're like spread the word like tell

everybody and you're being just kept and

yeah and it's basically like put the

word out to get to the docks

okay well getting to the docks is gonna

because the city is now literally on

fire

mm-hm because there are demons running

through the streets and those of you who

have fought demons before these aren't

you're not it's nothing like this right

they're the kind of things that you

would expect to fight and probably deal

with normally but for peasants and

they're being ripped apart right getting

from you here to the docks there's gonna

be a skill challenge

alright so skill challenge does

something 4th edition that I quite like

and what we do is you guys use your

skills to describe to me how your

character

can make it easier to get to the docks

without getting in a fight right and you

can only each this is cool

so you have to get six successes before

you get three failures you're going to

get to the docks right that's not an

issue the question is how what what

happens once you get there is there it's

are a ton of demons there because it

took you guys too long to get there or

did you guys get there ahead of this

wave of chaos that's rippling through

the city so you're gonna get there no

matter what skills you use you have to

be trained in the skill you have to be

proficient in the skill and each person

can only try each skill right what beach

skill once right so if you tried I'll

give you a couple examples like if

somebody wanted to use there are gates

throughout the city and the city guard

are closing the gates trying to stop

stem the tide and stop the demons from

getting from one quarter of the city to

another you could for instance use your

athletics to try to bend bars and lift

gates and open one of these gates and

that would if you made it that would be

a success but if you fail then you waste

time with this thing this it turns out

to be too heavy and you accumulated

failure so it's always a risk reward

scenario but you got your soonerlater

you got to get six successes the only

question is can you do without getting

any failures and in fact in fact I know

if it's gonna work but chat is going to

take the role of the citizens of Black

Bottom and they are gonna have some

effect over your successes or failures

because it's up to them to decide how

did the citizens of Black Bottom react

to what's happening there should be a

straw poll I know that Jerry is super

overloaded right now but I will check

and see there should be a straw poll

where they have three options give me a

minute I just heard the voice of God say

give me a minute your three options

don't bother don't bother voting in chat

right now cuz it's we're nuns no way to

track everybody voting but you're in

your three options also Phil correct me

if I'm wrong but sweetness from black

alright it's been a long time since you

bigger stuff has changed and black loud

was always notoriously squirrely

together

it was never designed to be a big city

it grew that way doesn't matter but you

will be able to convert one failure into

a successful well let me just tell you

I've got a couple skills up here you

have this one you might be the guy you

might make all six of them my my

background feature yes my virgin

background here gives me the city

secrets whoo when I'm not in combat I

and any companions I lead can travel

between two locations in the city twice

as fast as my speed would normally allow

in addition to that yeah as a pugilist

I have street smart so basically that's

super cool once I have caroused in the

settlement for eight hours or more which

oh yeah you guys right I know all public

locations in the city as if I were born

and raised there and you cannot be lost

by non magical means while within the

city I mean I was born and raised here

you were born and raised here so what

I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just use the

board here to mark successes and

failures you guys need to get one too

[Laughter]

you could set up a little whiteboard

here well yeah but are you trying you

can sure yeah and here are three

failures so you guys are trying to get

six successes before you get three

failures I wish my to skill challenge

and the size of your background you guys

already have a success total between all

of us correct got it okay

yeah you can cast you can cast

invisibility yes but is that gonna help

the chain get through like it's like a

company it's what we used to call the

a-team scene that is now an obscure

reference but it is you guys moving

together as a group so uv-visible means

that you're not gonna have a problem

getting to the docks but if you want to

leave these people behind then you know

he doesn't have that if judge doesn't

have that skill we might actually be

able to catch up with judge somewhere

over here and then go as

there are lots of different ways to use

skills I have written down but it's up

to you guys to kind of give me some

examples like it gave you that one you

know you could it's up to you to

determine how do I use my skills to do

this but there was a bunch of different

scenarios like you could use perception

to notice an empty building that you

could cut so it's up to you guys to you

this is your opportunity to use your

skills creatively how could you use the

things you're proficient at to use

players each player can only use each

skill once but like let's imagine you

all have athletics right you could all

you could each individually trying to

break through these gates intimidation

is yeah that would be great yeah there's

definitely guards that are trying to

stop people from moving through the city

and you could make an Intimidator and

the thing is if you make it the guards

are gonna help you try to get through

that's a success if you fail the guards

try to stop you and now you've got

you're not get this not be a combat you

could prolly dispatch a city card pretty

easily special love you guys but that

takes time that's a failure is there any

so intimidation

we're totally worth is there any so I

can move through non-magical terrain I

can move through difficult train gonna

affect me some alone you can move

through it stealthily abnormal pace or

did slow me I don't know if there's any

situations where well this isn't this

isn't this isn't this is just regular

but a trip oh I didn't know if like

that's joint buildings would would have

been like doing something you could

combine that with like an investigation

check to see can I find a building yeah

that is ruined that these guys wouldn't

be able to get by but if they follow me

if they follow me they can get through

but that would require you making an

investigation check to see do I notice

can I determine that there is terrain

like that so that you could then use

your special ability to lead the rest of

the group and you know there's no

requirement that you have to do yeah

right I could just persuade these guys

yeah persuade on the shoulder listen man

noticed but I've got the

Linux check cover schmuck Cruden they

got to get out this whole city thought

about joining us today that's actually a

good point is it part of the theme of

this campaign is rebuilding the company

because you guys have been there have

been times in your memory where there

were 10,000 soldiers in shame you're a

kind of a low a bat only 300 so if

you're ever gonna do anything about what

happened today you're going to need more

soldiers alloy yes yeah yeah the fall of

all the way yeah all right

see let's do it yeah I'm ready it's up

to you guys it's you I've described the

scenario so need to take the initiative

interest are rolling to start telling me

what skills you want to use there's no

order to it there's no initiative it is

the 47% so as you guys move through the

city and King for instance this is is

mentioning hey we should try to like see

if we can you know recruiting these

people at these city guards they must be

the tap the city is going crazy it is

now just a nothing but a collection of

grab a stick and finish it because the

chap decided that it's 47% voted for the

city's they had the option they had the

option that they said the city schools

could try to help you guys right which

would have gotten you a success or that

the citizens could decide we want to

live and therefore we're gonna help Ajax

and that would have gotten you guys a

failure yeah but because they basically

go to that this guy they didn't know

that they'll I knew what they were

reveling I'm in charge of interpreting

where their reactions do you think so

what's your describe how you're gonna

use your skill I'm going to use

persuasion yeah that sounds good to sway

everybody to help us out of here

yeah there's as you guys because you

guys are by far the most organized thing

happening in the city right now and

there are three guards that try to stop

you from going they're saying stuff like

martial law and get into a buildings for

your own safety and that guy's coming

and they're gonna they're gonna they're

gonna hold you up unless you go ahead

wrong 16 you have no bonus to persuasion

listen there we go yeah that 16 would

have been enough these guys are just

normal city guards so what does it you

say to them

what does Neil say I take a long pull on

my cigarette listen guys this day is not

gonna get any better

[Laughter]

yeah I think I think I'm gonna make a

note that that in fact I need to write

down but that's gonna help with the size

well they're like alright well then

we're with you yeah I mean guy walks up

to you he's like like you guys are like

more competent than even like the

captains of the guards I could just see

him like walking through the crowd

everyone's freaking out just like yeah I

find that Apple that I stole take a bite

all right so that's I guess a bit too

bad all right well any of this strength

II stuff I can go for that and go ahead

and make a shot there's a closed city

gate before you uh-huh and it's like you

know it's not it's light but it's like

16 feet huh yeah so moving it it's made

out of wood plus 8 yeah that's 26 yeah

so what was the main uh it was made out

of wood

yeah the commander now now the commander

commander suite just runs up to this

thing

commander suite and he just clocks it

right he's not there's no common gate he

literally like as a boxer and he just

punches the thing and the thing explodes

cuz he's got a belt a pill giant

strength he's you know what's happening

here hits what are you hard anyway yeah

so the would just splinters into a

million pieces of now there is literally

no gate and there are watchtowers on the

gate and one of the guards like is

watching this news and he tumbles and

falls off and snacks on the ground and

knocked out just purely based on I just

marked that as a success correct I don't

want ya

any guy in the company that's gonna

faint over that well because he was kind

of like gobsmacked by what you just did

was kind of leaning over to watch and

then kind of yeah the moment away from

does anybody else have any other stuff

they might think of any other uses for

their skills except he's dead each get

one skip we we can only use one skill

skill once you can use as many skills as

okay yeah so this card captain yeah a

guard captain stands before you and says

you know by order of the Lord Mayor no

one can move through this gate there are

demons running around what is your role

16 are you serious holy Sh a proficient

oh that's right you have 48 on your

tongue she gets to add double her

permission to modify her when she's

making persuasion cease the demons and

he's like what is your command he's

following you guys you guys I slowly

accumulating cards and by the way these

are you know guards are there like first

level or you know virus there they're

perfect perfect recruits for the chain

and they know we need the chain our

famous I know you guys are so you can

arrange I feel like I should be able to

do some sort of perception thing to me

well you could you were correct tom you

could like knowing you could make a

survival check and see if you could lead

the group through the sewers that would

a lot yeah because there might not be

any demons down there yeah I'll try that

okay

then 11 13 13 these DVDs aren't that

hard actually 30 is the DC for them yeah

there is a sewer entrance that's got an

iron cover over it and you're a goblin

you're no way yeah no problem

so how do you communicate to these guys

that this would be a faster safer way to

get to the city I feel like what this

something do with the banner maybe like

that's good idea like I have the banner

and maybe I raise it and I somehow by

signal you know how the others traffic

cones signals like oh sure sure sure

somehow like oh like this big cat

running the circles so people see the

banner oh yeah that means like come here

or something like I found a way so yeah

the rest of the chain including all you

know the junior officers and the people

that they are leading see copper on big

cat spinning around and then the

tentacles big cats tentacle and grab the

manhole cover and pull it off and copper

big cat jump into the sewer do you guys

follow yep is that a faster way yeah

yeah absolutely well just cause like I

said my guy knows this city well super

trooper 86 can we panic again really

strong perception as well so I could so

deception

I'm not proficient in it so I would not

double for proficiency for deception is

that correct correct you have to be

proficient in the skill - so let's see

what you were saying deception who has

deception yeah

yeah there's a there's a patrol that

there's a band of demons wandering

through the city and they look in your

direction but they don't immediately

appear to recognize that you guys are

who they're looking for uh who are they

looking for well they're almost

certainly looking for you guys

but they don't necessarily know one

human from another and that that's you

guys so there's a moment of their were

they pause I I would I would cast a

minor illusion down a down an alleyway

adjacent to them and create the sound of

rallying members of the change oh that's

awesome yeah okay go ahead make a

deception shot yeah no problem

yep yeah these these demons hear that

and they are immediately drawn to it and

they bark and gabble in their heathen

lingo and start charging down an

alleyway

okay so that happen you guys go through

the sewers for like I don't know it's

probably like ten minutes because it's a

big city

alright but you aren't booking it and

there's no one higher it smells bad you

know the smell of offal is in your nose

and now you're knee-deep in the waste of

the city but can I just say when I as

were going through it I actually think

it smells pretty good when they were

playing and they were on a raft and they

had to make a skill check in the swamp

and somebody failed their skill check

yeah so coppers like oh great and then

you guys emerge from the sewers and so

was that we do Marcus we didn't mark the

silly though so you guys are seven eight

nine ten

we played for like two and a half hours

before the break so we're getting okay

you guys as you emerged from the sewers

you can see the masts of ships right but

it's still quite a ways away many

buildings so you're definitely going in

the right direction and that's when you

see the band of demon

and that's when nails casts distraction

the demons all book it and I believe

that's your six success correct that was

yes by the way that is a I believe that

is an easy skill challenge like a hard

skill challenge will be something like

it's always three failures ends it but a

hard skill challenge will be you need

twelve successes but given the

circumstance been wonders increase the d

c-- know the d c-- depends on the skill

you're using in what you're trying to do

each skill you're trying to use is a

scenario has a different DC so there

might be so for instance like if you can

come up with the way to use Arkana in

this it probably would have been weird

and obscure and not super relevant to

escaping a city so it so it so if it

were allowed that would be a very high

DC right but a lot of stuff you guys did

was really straightforward and escaping

the city in a scenario like this however

it would not have been easy for you guys

to so yeah you guys make it to the docks

you guys are here yeah go mini cannon we

got all that art for your dude what a

waste of money that's right i'm gonna

invade another D&D campaign to bring it

back one of the little tripods that

holds all the curtains whoa

should we move our guys out of the way

hello how I spent my weekend sweet what

we're saying it's sweet know me sweet

now I'm gonna have to I think I'm gonna

have to name a new commander no tenant

that's true that's true

King I'll have a new character I'll make

them does that does not move actually

none of the parts really move although

you can pick it up and it does it does

it's just it's just sticky kind of took

it

yeah the layers are really interesting

that's the main reason that so you can

simply get up different fights under

yeah you can have a running battle that

went from yeah this was actually this is

um dark ops is the name of the company

and this is the sea wolf I don't

remember how much this was but it's

pretty cool and apart from the masts

which ship are very tricky and actually

some of these are not glued in some of

these would just come off if you took

them off the it was really easy put

together it took like five hours to do

everything but the masts and then

probably another three or four hours to

do the masts only because like I said it

was really tricky and the problem the

number one problem is the dowels the

dowels like all of these parts dark

Ottomans and they come on a thing you

punch them out and they are machined

very precisely but the dowels they just

ordered and so they come it's like oh

this one's nine millimeters thick but

actually it's twelve right and I I spent

most of my time as animal to test to

sanding these things anyway Andy right

bla bla gonna tell them about your

special made name

don't show it to him Wow anyway so this

you guys are ahead of the junior

officers who themselves are ahead of the

rest of the company but you are now at

the docks and which what what was

boots saying those boots when he's like

we got to get the docks and you're like

I know a guy I know a guy okay

well it's a it is a lady in fact lady

and Margaret messing him captain correct

yes oh so boots is correct me if I'm

wrong boots is like a swashbuckling

swashbuckler duelist kind of a theory

Odin yes he's real honey okay's from

capital so yeah boots yeah boots knows

the captain of the row so CLO and that

is so boots is like I got and they're

also CL is a huge it's one of the

largest ships in heart right now now

there are there is basically an army of

people running to these ships right

all of these ships are people are they

want to get on these things right they

want to leave and the end of you know

the crew of the Rosso CLO are mostly

ryokan and they are in the process of

like loading cargo and they're looking

at you guys running toward them and

they're all these real ones have

typically have like dark skin and dark

hair and they dress very especially

those sailors dress really flamboyantly

and you can see them all on the rigging

and stuff working this large crane crane

yeah basically working a large wooden

crane with weights on one in the biggest

and they all stop and they're like so

what does what does boots say what does

boots do what does what do boots do

there is they're made for walking there

is a way that goes up to I mean that's

that's in dock it's not going anywhere

wait a second but it's getting ready to

leave boots

runs up the plank and demands to see the

minutes to speak to Lady Margaret as you

start running up the plank the crew

members all call for somebody whose name

you recognize Modesto Edisto is the

first mate and this you know naked to

the waist earring be clad ryokan with a

bandana around his neck and this kind of

almost the spirit flamboyant mustache

says Oh their friend I know it don't I

know you

good let's do my boy Oh God what what is

what is Boots's actually I don't know if

there's no if I wouldn't know your real

name

but he calls you by some other nickname

right because he you probably used some

weird alien I'm hearing several yeah

exactly yeah and he remembers he

remembers one of those hmm and he says

what do you have to do with this uh well

I uh he's trying to stop you from

getting on the ship so you can just make

a persuasion check to see if you can get

past this guy alright and see if you can

talk to the captain listen my friend

remembered that one time with that one

thing when I really helped you out no

anyway I remember this is not how I

remember it

I do not remember I remember you being

quite a pain in the 14 well you do know

him oh it's that guy sorry

he might not be proficient oh yeah no

it's just that he's but he does have

charisma so he's gonna be I think what's

the rule is gonna be +2 with crispo's +

is it +3 with charisma and +6 with these

yeah yeah so your plus if you get +3

from Crosman

sorry and you remembered the captain's

name right yes do you do you use that

when you're talking to this guy like to

impress him with your mid-level of

course okay so

definitely you know reminding good estou

of your relationship with captain

massing ham will get you I mean he's

like captain and so meanwhile what are

you guys doing by the way are you guys

walking at the plank are you guys

waiting at the base on the docks waiting

to see what happens

well I mean I think the standard-bearer

needs to be getting you know like I'm

ready hundred only make sure that our

guys any of our guys that are coming

know to get here I think like we need to

make sure that whoever our chronicler is

yeah King King King is well you guys

hold it with no failures so that means

not only does obviously the standard

bearer makes it but it means King make

so it also means the treasurer makes it

Wow okay one of the things you guys

could have done is if you needed to you

could have jettisoned the Treasury in

order to convert a failure to success I

think I think we need to start just we

just start getting on a ship well

there's a whole but okay but yeah I

think well I mean I don't know I mean it

depends on his on boots a success right

right because if boots is not being

successful then then I mean I think

we're just gonna push our way

well these guys these these sailors are

all marked alright they all have like

fashions right but they have it there

and so they're uh they're basically like

a unit of infantry on their own right

they're not their light infantry so if

they wanted to stop you you know

especially just like the five years I

would there would be a fight and now you

guys are a lot more experienced than a

bunch of sailors on the ship but they're

watching gheh desto seems to be

negotiating okay let him do his thing

he's like home but he's not he's not

saying kill this man right right and

there are guys with crossbows they don't

use bows they're guys with crossbows no

one's firing and there does seem to be a

tech between Kadesh no and boots

okay well definitely bring bring the

Treasury up closer okay yeah no problem

yeah the junior officers actually it's

two shoes right yeah

two shoes we'll have the Treasury

brought up in this giant chest go bump

on the and all of the sailors all stop

yeah because it's a suspiciously large

treasure shaped chest wow this is

catches there this will give her their

attention it'll let them know that we

can pay you see a barn show your family

just regular citizens many of them not

fully dressed it's not yet even 6:30 in

the morning running at this ship and the

they all get to come okay well happen

how do you any of it or any of our men

here oh yeah it's taking time but slowly

more and more memory so it's how are you

gonna take like hours to get everybody

in the chain and there's no one I don't

know that we have hours right but I mean

any of any of the soldiers are here I

think they need need to you know this is

our ship right so the sailors when they

see these guys coming I'll get em the

crossbows with these citizens but when

they see you commanding copper to hold

these guys off

what does copper do so the soldiers are

trying to get on sorry regular everyday

people are trying to get godmom people

are these guys this mob of people which

are growing by the moment is like my god

it's like watch right and so yeah yeah

you give the command from the you know

you probably have like using just animal

handling and your position and your

heels and stuff like I gave his big and

big cat knows you really well yeah yeah

stands up any Flay's his to explains to

tentacles and they shut her and the

people just stop go ahead okay I don't

know if I if I get to do this to reply

but like displacement so yeah sure yeah

so now there's like it's hard to see

looks almost as though he's melting into

the etheric plane or something as this

figure with Brewis stretches and smears

across reality and people stop and they

look and there's another boat over there

I think and they all start running away

and then they spread these fork and

there

like screw it they're just going on the

path of least resistance right so this

woman approaches and you can you these

guys kappa you can hear her heavy boot

steps and she is dressed like a Vaz

lorry and she's a bad lawyer descent

she's a big Li right she's like six feet

tall she's wide and she's got this kind

of classic tricorn captain's hat on

she's got hair that maybe it was read

once before she spent a lifetime in the

Sun but now it's super bleached it's

like strawberry blonde

it's like flax just sticking out from

under her head just big red cheeks she

has freckles and she's like boots hell

are you doing here lady vetting them it

has been far too long

well I do remember our last meeting with

fondness as do i in fact I wish that we

were meeting again on happier

circumstances is this your fault did you

do this she put the city is like on fire

right there's there's a giant floating

Citadel hanging over everything you guys

by the way are now out from underneath

that okay right to float you can now see

there's a name for it it's the cry stop

ellipse cry stop Alice CH ry s okay it

means city of gold is this your fault

did you do this no rather well listen

that's not important right now

I'm wondering how I might convince you

to agree with me that it might be a good

idea to movin up my men here and set

sail for somewhere else she looks at the

Christ operas and looks back you sis

who's chasing you uh I really wouldn't

worry about that and cadastro says it's

Ajax isn't it uh okay yes it is

you're being honest okay she says black

gods you're asking us to make an enemy

of Ajax the invincible well he's not

here right now so I think if we set sail

you know quick as you like her first

mate Podesta was like me there are yeah

you can stand by him yeah sure well no

I'm just use the things things are

starting to go a little sideways so I'm

thinking we need some persuasion there's

some intimidation boots this is I mean

don't get me wrong boots I like you but

this is a complex situation you're

walking into the middle of she says and

and a good gesture goes and then judge

presents himself what gods she says

again judge is gonna you know actually

she look shot huh yeah anyway so he's

gonna explain you know I'm not trying to

get you all in trouble

hey are those real which ones

it's just point of yours oh yeah okay no

she's not that she's not that she's

curious but she thought that would yeah

so he's an explained how real fast well

yeah um explaining they're not you know

they're not looking for trouble like

they can certainly pay their way if that

would make things easier for them and in

fact that Ajax was after their commander

who has since been eaten and they would

like to leave the city for greener

pastures

she's money like how much money it would

take a lot

and she looks at a doorway this there's

a doorway over here you guys can't see

but she's like I mean it would take a

lot yeah you know it doesn't mean is you

can't there's no there's a doorway down

into the hole I mean look at this cargo

I mean we're talking about what you

thousand what your price well how much

you got which it could be worth it could

be worth my ship she says to make an

enemy of Ajax and you can hear that the

men are like we need to get out of here

how many of our men are here well all of

the junior officers are here okay and I

would say well depends are you gonna use

the Treasury or you gonna use their

persuasion are you gonna combine the two

somehow and we're gonna try and persuade

are you gonna try and persuade your way

on without having to use money I would

rather not intimidate them especially

since we need a favor

there's like we don't well here's my

thought is we could take the

captain all right judges no tour you've

worked with judge judges notoriously

like behind the book

judges judges bottled and like super

lawful okay so if there's a way if

there's a way to do this without burning

bridges life's always easier when you

make friends which come off of what lot

for what you're a priest of Asmodeus you

could probably guess and be correct well

no we certainly wouldn't be a chaotic

act we would just be getting rid of the

captain and installing a new one

chaos is usually involved in a Hannover

term Union of those sorts well I can

order you to do I mean it's gonna be no

but now go ahead it's gonna be tough

finding anything crew well after you

kill no remember when we found the

ghosts and the first campaign reserves

that and you can use all the things you

know like you can convince them by

talking about like look the longer we're

here we're all going to die there's

several things that you can do in that

to your role it's up to you how you guys

use your resources you can just make a

persuasion check which I mean you're

doing a pretty good job I'd like to I'd

like to see if I can use my persuasion

to basically I know we're gonna have to

pay but I would like us to ideally not

pay so much okay so the combination of

boots being here and then having some

kind of prior relationship and then me

stepping up and kind of persuading this

captain that you know hey we're not

trying to mooch off you like we just

want to get to capital go ahead make a

going make a thirty so by the way there

are demons now flooding onto the docks

now the docks are huge this is a big big

structure there are many boats but there

are demons flowing and cadets toes like

captain we have to leave yeah because I

think Delaney is just like sort of she

sees the chest that you guys have and

she's like we can work out a price after

it get on all right

is there like a TripAdvisor for escape

galleons how many dollar signs is this

crying I mean Cobra yeah so yeah you

guys get about you guys get the okay so

here's a question like the crane it's

gonna take another you know a couple of

rounds to load this cargo up and it's

make it substantive eight for them to

load the cargo well if we if we wait a

little while

does that mean more of our guys can get

here uh yes yeah but we might have to

fight yeah it could maybe have never

being a strand there was an I can maybe

shoot some demons and air as they're

coming about that what are we talking

like that we can take uh individually

yep but not as a little like a baked

pork yeah it's basically a army of

demons us marching for the city well I

mean it might just be the matter of like

like how much is that cargo worth

captain oh you don't know who you're

pissing off can use your he'll giant

like just it's a combination of pulleys

ropes and also weights and so yeah if

you brace yourself against the mass you

could just start yeah yeah I mean it's

it's it's very heavy

but you were supernaturally strong and

so yeah you just say yeah grab this

thing and yanking it and looked kringles

all right like that wrenches around each

each time you pull it it moves this like

30 degrees and you drop this giant

package on it's you know it's like bound

together what's I'm looking for like a

giant crates like giant crates nailed

shut

alright and they go coop and they land

on the deck and they're all in netting

and the netting collapses and yeah a

little bit yeah

alright so we need to order our any of

our guys that are here to get on the

guide on the damn boat okay looks like

you get you get you get about between 60

and 70 guys on the boat and is that I

mean they're close

yeah yeah and now there's just demons

everywhere the they are pulling up

anchor yeah and the sails are already it

doesn't look like this the sales are

already

and they start you know slowly pulling

out now that you guys are on board now

that the sailors are all in the rigging

doing their jobs moving around like they

were like it was regular just walking on

the ground now a flood of people are

coming at the docks people are jumping

off the docks trying to get on this boat

and it's only like right now it's only

like five seven feet away but the ship

is slowly pulling away and people are

just jumping into the water and these

demons are starting to just rip people

apart do we I'm how much space do we

have on the boat still hate so Gabby no

there's I mean I mean did our guys fill

it up no there's a lot of those I mean

they fill up they pack the top deck but

there's like three different levels

below this thing you know what can carry

you well I mean any of those people in

the water look like other ships none as

big as this but also there are some

three masters are also a pulling leg and

at this point you see as these ships are

escaping the harbor all these tiny

little dinghies are trying to get away

you see this tiny floating figure that

actually does look a little bit like

this or like this character represented

as Morton was described to you and he's

super far away and kind of floating

around and from him spells are meeting

yeah and one of the galleons as is

pulling out of port gets hit with one

fireball and then another fireball the

masts are destroyed and the ship starts

listing and sinking and he's you know

got some kind of crazy extended range on

his spells they allow them to stay how

far away is he you can't get it sent it

could be a thousand feet so not within

armor aurait not within weapons range

320

actually you would probably recognize

that this is like battle magic this is

magic that you only have access to when

you have a strong this is there's his

stronghold is right there and so it it

decimates units right the entire crew is

now very heavily motivated to make sure

that the sails are properly rigged and

the Rosco's yellow is in spite of being

the biggest ship in poor it's it's

somehow built for speed and so it is

accelerating and there was at least one

other ship a pirate ship well I mean

like a merchant merchant ship for godot

says it is early in our relationship for

us to be is calling each other names

he's like how would you like it if we

all refer to you with filthy murderers

do we do some piracy you know who can

say piracy is in the eye of the beholder

my mother always said so there's one

other galleon that's that's kind of

keeping pace with the Ross OClO

and captain massing ham is at the mast

and she's barking orders to the crew and

the entire crew all move as one person

and Gaston is up here trying to kind of

coordinate the efforts of the riggers

and as you guys the wind fills the sails

and the sky above you it's now like 7:30

8 o'clock in the morning it's a bright

beautiful day and you can see the giant

floating Citadel is retreating getting

smaller and smaller as you pull away

from the city and this one other ship

and she points and she knows the name of

the ship it's called the sparrow and

she's like eyes on the sparrow because

she's using them as kind of a gauge to

see how well are we doing and she's like

we should beat them and the process

yellow is pulling ahead and these giant

tentacles come up from the water and

start wrapping themselves around the

sparrow and you can see the tiny figures

on the ship it's a it's a bad Lorient

ship you can see these guys they they

don't look like pirates they almost look

like they're in uniform you can see them

hacking and

these chemicals but there are you know

dozens of them and they slowly wrap

around the ship and break it in half and

pull the ship below water and Wow

captain massing ham says who it turns to

boots and says which one of you is in

charge

commander you really know how to make

things tough for me where are we going

capital well someone's not going to be

happy with that and there was a this

dude comes out of the hole and let's see

perhaps yeah he's a heifer and he's he's

you guys are I don't know how familiar

you you would be with this but he's

wearing a Jax's livery and he says turn

the ship around and as he's talking

other other half works start coming out

of the hole there's like there's a bunch

of them and they all have they all have

the symbol of st. Ajax on their on their

two barns on their clothing on their

shields and it's all eleven o'clock it's

funky place it's not oh my god Wow okay

anyway thanks for putting up with the

final contract of the chain and now it's

just a question of how you guys get

kappa and as i said before like the

first half of that super super cut scene

ii and then there's what do you guys do

and the skill challenge and now you guys

are a little more in control and it's

still gonna be a little railroad e from

here to capital but like this encounter

it's gonna be lots of stuff I use guys

to do and then once you get to capital

is gonna be very kind of open the world

sandbox e and so cool so anyway I think

that's it I think we streamed Indy for

the first time

I hope you guys had fun and our is also

played we gotta get any work for you we

got to talk to Jason and get any work

for your new dude how many Infinity

stones does Ajax have now well your last

a good question during the break and it

didn't come up and that is did lady

cereal drop the other sword yeah and the

answer was yes so but so now Ajax has at

least one of those just degraded you saw

you saw I described it as a Ryan it's

not clear whether or not I certainly

somebody in the chain is familiar with

these ancient elven artifact swords and

then now you guys are on the ship you

can kind of talk about what happened and

part of that is that was a Ryan the

Master Sword and it makes you basically

invulnerable to all weapons and it's

gone now yeah and what what what the

power is of the teeth of the Dragon when

the Master Sword is broken is unknown

but they were pretty sure that the

second short sword she pulled out was

scorpius's Eliza also so something you

have to decide and we should do it

either right now or we should wait and

talk about it next time we stream so the

folks don't miss anything is who's the

lieutenant I mean yes it could be Lars

is character that's up to you because

they already have ranks and you can only

have one but but somebody could give up

their rank and become lieutenant but

then that means so the relationship

between the commander and lieutenant is

the commander decides what jobs do we

take you don't you don't necessarily

really issue orders and that would be

bad leadership to be constantly telling

her what to do the lieutenant figures

out okay how are we gonna do this mm-hm

right neither one of them really is the

tactics commander that would be like the

sergeant if there was one of nobodies

like that so you guys are still free to

play your characters in combat whoever

you want but that's lieutenant's job to

kind of like coordinate the effort after

the captain decides what we're doing so

that's something you can think about

Lars I assume you'll have a new

character you work here you have nothing

else to do but make a new person

keep saying VARs PTO key departs I think

that's it I think we're done I think

we're gonna sign off thanks for watching

as I suspect this is the largest crowd

we're ever going to stream to I think

probably a lot of East Coast folks have

probably already logged off will upload

the video to YouTube as soon as we can

that probably means Friday morning and

then we'll do probably a campaign diary

tomorrow and I'll talk about what

happened and we'll do a live stream

world-building live stream eleven

o'clock on Saturday and we might talk

about this but the one thing that I want

to wait to talk about is the death of

the captain because that's gonna require

me talking to lawyer's office offline

and so when we do the post-mortem on

this I'm going to declare that

off-limits for now but not later later

we'll talk about it otherwise thanks for

watching everybody see you next

Wednesday
