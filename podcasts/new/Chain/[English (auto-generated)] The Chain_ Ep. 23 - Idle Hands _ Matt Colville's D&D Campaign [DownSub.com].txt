we are MCD and productions and we play

you know

[Music]

[Music]

indeed when last we left our heroes the

chain of Akron were in the process of

exploring ring well and you had just

entered this room I believe which is a

30 by 30 it's 30 feet across round room

there's actually the way in is 10 feet

wide and has an exit and the walls and

the floor and the ceiling all have are

coated in metal and the there used to be

things carved on this metal but now it

is that whatever there is has been

beaten smooth so you can still make out

some of the glyphs the carvings whatever

they were but mostly all you see is

hammered metal and as you guys are enter

this room three clouds with yeah they

look like can we I think here there's

one unfortunately Jason's dog judges

seal tokens yeah thank you like like a

little tiny bit and just like put a poof

on each head each yeah that's a nice

circle there and there's three handed

yeah I wasn't in the room not anything

I was I was standing outside looking in

watching these numbnuts get yeah I was

engulfed

oh no okay like putting a magnet and

these clouds there they're man-sized and

they appear to be like boiling gray

mists that are that these striations

these red flashes that go up and along

them and it's going to initiative you

know by the way matter Driscoll's not

here um cuz we don't like him anymore

he's out anymore

and because he smells is like never

pronounced with an H it's true yes or t8

is because he just pronounces him like

an F all talk like mad risk of the day

yeah guys we shouldn't make fun of him

yeah probably because it's not here to

defend scale it away

all right stand by while I write stuff

down if I were smart Boogedy I'm

actually it's been quite a lot of work

getting the map they're getting drawing

that circle that circle it's nights like

glow don't worry there's more coming

morning circles coming to see you look

at that smell so nice I replaced your

old thank you I replaced your old map

with a new map look at these circles

Center look at those Wow looks like you

use a circle template that's for an eye

I have technology yeah I was an amateur

tractor before but he's gonna say old

man Lord garage is like that could you

just say something on how you know Odie

is gone apparently chat is just so quiet

it's just such gorgeous no slime oh wait

you know dr. basil doctor is gifting

twenty Tier one subs thank you very much

so slim what does your eye initiative

five okay let's assume that that is

among the worst judge 10/10 is double am

I done here copper and big cat 24 look

at pro pro pro Ranger King

for look at that 16:16

okay so copper and big cat you see three

of your friends enveloped in these mists

[Music]

[Laughter]

yeah there's a there's some art of me

with mine so are they like like is there

their head and it was like on their head

or no it's it's it's like it's like they

feet tall okay five feet wide so you

can't even see them oh they're all

envelops mists I believe it's pronounced

enveloped they're enveloped what you

gonna do I don't know shooting them

shoots

I'll try shooting like Jeff gust of wind

I'm just turn around and do it like a

wind area we've been joking so much

about running back to the butcher shop

that like didn't even don't know right

right right

not that jump yeah and try and produce

your own breeze yeah well I mean I did

have talked about my hunch so give us a

little while yeah all right I guess I'll

just come on in what universe are fart

jokes not funny

oh I don't yeah I'm gonna try shoot

anyone see what happens I don't know if

I'm gonna hurt my own teammate that

means I need to find out I'll shoot

[Laughter]

at the 15 no 16 16 yeah you see the

arrow disappears and you hear you hear a

thick cockney voice go that's two eight

eight

yeah your your arrow disappears got it

that's number one

is there is there any reaction to

anything no you don't actually hear

leach call out okay that was a okay he

being funny okay but it just disappears

inside the smoke correct yeah

there's no like there's no sign that

you've done any deaths no I can't

there's no outward indication that that

the mist is in any way meaningfully

diminished right well he didn't scream

so maybe that maybe yeah oh shoot you

can also trim again oh man I missed like

have we can't just like grasp grab some

round into there and he does every

ferocity right yeah grab yet no

gratitude gravity gravity gravity of the

situation one takes one to know one

oh thank you so just attack what has our

don't send dad jokes to my phone you can

come in here and tell people your dad

jokes look up spells 21 AC 21 hits or

you're the arrow or the bow you're

shooting as copper is magic correct yeah

got it yeah this is big cat now attack

correct so we'll see what happen to that

[Music]

or that's a - there's a weapon Smith

work on big yet no no she can't show her

a sword though yeah Christ

jokes or the judge can't improve the

quality of five fifteen fifteen okay

that's interesting sorry one second ten

as way alright that's better I like that

better got it yeah you see her her

tentacles like a whiff whiff through the

mist and it does some myths does come

off on our bods but a lot of it just

seems to dissolve right through almost

like it's quasi ethereal okay she hits

all the way through but doesn't hit like

a solid core kind of thing like there's

a guy in there well there was there is a

person in there but she's not attacking

the person so there's no danger they're

gonna accidentally hit the person inside

on it okay I guess that's my main

concern but so slim walks up and just

does a full-on like horizontal cleave

through all five feet of the diameter of

the cloud I mean it says I mean I'm

going by the strict interpretation of

the rule I see

which makes no concession to the fact

that there might be somebody inside the

mist certainly as the dungeon master I

could rule yeah that if the mist uses

its ability to occupy something else of

space that like missing the mist

especially if you miss by a certain

amount you're you might hit the Perseid

right that would seem reasonable to me

and I think that is how fifth edition is

designed basically that if you want that

level of kind of specificity or

robustness

it's the Dungeon Master's to add right

now and now it's the clouds Clara so

let's see I need judge and boots to make

Constitution saving throws

[Music]

ooh that's a big ol seven did I win

yes yes 1414 you both take ten points of

necrotic damage your hit maximum hit

points are reduced by ten points oh no

and you notice that the the red those

are you looking into the room notice

that each of these clouds they pulse

and with each pulse the red lightning

that erupts up from inside them gets

brighter and brighter and you hear you

hear Leach cry out as he also fails to

saving through and it looks as though

you know after after did you hit the

same one that did did your pet hit the

same one you hit yeah so that one you

probably might not even realized that it

was diminished until now you see co grow

back to its original size okay so it's

ten points of damage then we also took

ten it's just ten you're yeah current

and Max it boys go good John there's

like some kind of race clouds or

something yeah brief clouds

that's a modular it says on the team I'm

something draw my fresh new black iron

magic rapier at noon start flailing it

madly in this in this cloud your your

evil blade my evil bleed dark metal

blade of darkness that's a crit yes like

this sword already Oh whew so that's

great mood tonight thanks for coming by

everybody it's cuz I grossly over

prepared for the next so I guess I also

those of you were watching last time I

noticed that I was very disorganized in

my ability to go through my notes I

haven't put all the rooms on cards

should be relatively straightforward to

the final room I need in though that's

good 24 damage from the first set that's

that's what this is which what are you

attacking are you attacking the leech

one or you're attacking my

that's that's that's number 224 damage

yeah you guys can now see boots inside

flailing and striking at this thing

because his attacks have diminished the

cloud so much 20:48

yeah so 24 hits yes that is 11 damage

1100 just in a second attack is dead

yeah I'm gonna go does it have to be

against the same target yeah yeah okay

dude rip judge killed him too fast you

killed him you killed him dead

I'm gonna reach out into the mist and

see is this something I can grasp I mean

I want to try and use infernal conduit

it's like grab the vampire back and like

yeah well I mean like grab some like the

veins or whatever and then like try to

use my own you will find out what

happens together to use my vampiric

ability to like drain the life force out

of the clouds myself all right so you're

saying give me that back that's mine so

it's changed how it works on paper but

now I use what the eights idiots yeah up

to my level with this so I can use up to

78 well I'm just going to use 48 for now

to see how it goes yeah 48 on average

will be 16 it has to make a constitution

savings no it has to be a 16 on its

Constitution savings grow too long is

one of its best pets but not good enough

I rolled a 10 it misses fails it's safe

well thank you 6 is 18

I do 18 damage exactly average you 18

damage to this one right yes so you all

see

the cloud that his enveloped Judge

starts to become more mist-like and

transparent and within you see judge

like grasping and you see the red

tendrils that are that are erupting go

into judges hand and the judge regains

judge judges anti-life abilities are

stronger than the vampiric mists

anti-life abilities how much damage you

said 1818 it's a lot that's a lot that's

that's the new version of infernal

conduit based on dice because I serve

fun and easy to roll in bad there are

other reasons there's a little footnote

in the new version of the Ulrika that

explains why it works that way because

people complain less about my design

when I explained why I did it that way

since I have my bonus action how's this

work can you use in your bonus action to

- or to disengage no you don't you you

don't have a bonus action certain

abilities grant you are used as a bonus

action so like normal people don't just

have a bonus actions they can use but

certain abilities let you do things as a

bonus action I see so like for instance

a rogue a rogue gets a class abilities

as a bonus action you can dash or

retreat or all that kind of movement

stuff but that's not something people

get yeah if you want to normally

disengage or - yet to convert your

action into okay that's right okay hmm I

don't think I want it in my turn or

start my turn in the cloud so I think

I'm gonna move away from it so you can

just like walk out of it yeah oh yeah it

doesn't move with her resume out of the

cloud in a way does it get an

opportunity I rule no okay

not based on the way it does really have

a tax in the classical sense you later

for his actions smelly vampire fart yes

that was judge it's slim slim Goodbody

that's uh I'll move into the room and go

up in attack slim enters the room and

the pilot

yeah sure yeah big guy takes up two

spaces all right and I'm swinging at my

great sword some serious looking dice

working lazy 14 yeah it's yeah they're

relatively easy to hit they're just big

papers armor so that's 12 damage this is

the Leitrim yes first exact it's okay

Wow first attack can I step one to the

right do I have enough just step to the

right there and attack the other one oh

yeah oh yeah oh yeah even if you were

behind the copper when you started I

don't work it's still enough woman 18

plus 8 26 soon that's a hit 15 damage

[Music]

you can't chop its head off alas that

was slim okay I'll just guy stole the

dead make a DC 15 was save details the

fails 19 damage it's dead from downtown

mmm-hmm yeah there's an archway that

leads south to the next or to implode -

where're you don't know that's what you

might find out depending where we are

yeah correct

okay

so to draw on your nice map with my

shitty it's your map so we're going this

is my map it's not drawn my man we have

a two artists we have dos dos artists

powerful work yeah I mean you the artist

want to draw on it

I haven't spun they have a volunteer

I'll just critique it yeah put our nose

I mean I guess that's a nice dizzy

circle it's not bad for you know anyway

I'm gonna head down this hallway okay

the hallway heads down it continues to

curve 10 20 30 40 50 feet and then opens

into a smaller room even smaller than

this one yeah it's 20 it's 20 across

this to the 30 across okay and this has

the corridor and the walls have that

same metallic gilding and that once

carried some kind of carvings and have

been over the centuries or millennia

beaten almost smooth what's yeah I

thought it was like a prison because of

the metal but it had carvings on a

previously so makes me think there is in

the middle of this 10-foot smaller room

there is a Dyess and it's actually only

about this wide stone and on the top of

it sits a scepter oh hello

and there is around the Dyess there is

gold built into the floor there's a ring

of gold that has arcane symbols on it

interesting let's take a look at also

there's a casting and fell out on a sand

and at the top of the top of the

pedestal there is like a built into the

pedestal there is a like a placard with

words written on it mmm

uh well let's get leach in here as well

to leach is unconscious the vampires the

vampire mist drained his drained his

essence

of essence

I will cast comprehend languages but I

have to touch it to be able to read it

should be luck guys

should we just do like look for traps

first yeah yeah little for you I'll get

my I'll get my comprehension ready yeah

you guys take a look around okay so by

the way this is a

there are there up there do not appear

to be any way any other way out who's

the best investigator actually I made a

new version I oh I was probably but yeah

but that's probably that and buses don't

have to be happy to but so super curious

as to what's going on guidance what's

that a D for D for a blessing of octave

so yeah but it's going to in this day

what would you do with Lady Rose 'var

just back on my shoulder just carrying

her around who the dragon lady I was a

dragon war he has a dragon born he has

an unconscious dragon board why I

carried her around because she wakes up

if she wakes up she's gonna go tell the

[ __ ] other houses about as well just

okay come on George

super look forward to seeing how that

result did you tie her up

no ideas as the train approaches you can

you can drag her down the hole on the

strip it's got a ten for investigating

what the Shh I rolled a four she rolled

a four although I'm gonna text Dodi and

tell him he died and start thinking

about a wizard no he'll get upset he'll

tune in every supposed to be doing

something else

Kiko will get all mad what are you doing

so retainers take a retainers take

damage based on the level of the spell

okay so yeah butts is investigating a

plastic him but twice in one day I think

it's been like maybe 20 minutes since

last time yeah but it gets down she

seems to be very clear

she's muttering to herself as she's

investigating and trying to read the

glyphs in the gold and she was like

definitely a warrant of some sort

probably probably says probably it could

be triggered based on the you know the

ethical nature of the person there are

some obscure wards that are based on on

your philosophy and your background but

this one looks like it's triggered for

you touch and she touches it and it goes

right and the whole thing lights up and

it throws her against the wall

she smashes against the wall and she has

knocked out she loses all her health but

she's not dead but she's not happy happy

yes yes yes okay is the word doing

anything else right now

yeah just you just turn off immediately

afterwards cuz she touched it and but

you know huh - appreciated roll better

she would not mean that was - she goodly

I don't know it's right down here

she's good late let's try said what she

said it was activated by touch sorry

well thank you has to do with their like

their ethics right like their philosophy

and their life philosophy and stuff like

that so what's touched it being kind of

a you know she's not as you know as good

as two-shoes but Judge I don't think I

should touch it

she's not as good as two-shoes what does

the scepter look like it is and now it's

it looks like it could be a very

expensive wood or metal covered in red

and gold enamel yeah maybe I should

touch it and it looks like yeah it looks

like it's it's not entirely unlike the

rod of the commander on you have for the

somnium members and there are then it's

it has its head is a stylized head of a

hawk

and yeah there's it sits on a little

stone pedestal like the pedestal is

obviously carved hold something like

this there's a round indentation that

sits on and it's it's much wider than

the width of the pedestal I don't wait I

guess this is this is how we either take

down that sound like wall and rescue our

friend me or this could be our ticket

into the depths of ring well or both

those you can want to know the truth you

can find out by going to our patreon

because I posted my notes or $5 patrons

in about all the secrets are there for

you to plunder should I try and our

boots eyes open

yes okay the magic sword is your since

you came back is your life I had a whole

lot of time you think about it quickly

you know how long has it been since

leach and Boots were killed not that

long it can't be more than like two

hours you guys I think you guys are

taking one short rest I believe since

then yeah so I mean how healthy are you

feeling I mean what are the odds that it

could do that twice in a row I mean

comprehend the language first you really

have like a dispel magic spell yet sauce

I'm at a third level spell so I can't I

have one third little film that means

well good news is you're playing in a

campaign run by a softy you don't really

need reverb fi turns out says the guy

who like like pass my I wonder if like

I'd like pass my sword through nothing

I'm just curious if it's like reacting

to like mm-hmm a living touch or like if

I can use an inanimate object to make

the Dragonborn touch it

she's asleep so cut off her hands yeah

what I'm gonna do a quick check around

the perimeter of the room with exile

just to see if there's any anything else

going on in here no secret doors okay

not that exile knows about okay

wait a minute wait a minute uh-huh I

tried to cast a spell magic from the

mandolin in the other room it didn't

work because the magic was shut off and

it didn't take up the spell slot so

wouldn't have used wouldn't have used

the slot right ports or what yeah if you

wait it didn't you said it was just like

it was no mandolin yeah yeah you were

energy were in there you were in the

room when you tried yeah like the stuff

that he was casting outside the room and

it cost him the spell slot and nothing

happened you you didn't it didn't use it

was not a magic it was not a magic loop

when you run there okay well now that

it's a now that it's a magic can I give

it a little yeah it's it's definitely

it's definitely enhancing your skill

with its own magics okay let me give

this a shot

I'm gonna had an explosive career a

little a little tune of whatever this

meant whatever this magic is this

powerful then it's about magic okay

sorry touch it yeah well unfortunately

that's not comprehend languages work I

have to touch it to be able to read it

if you invest thing in it better than a

alright I'm gonna try I'm gonna take I'm

gonna grab one of my javelins and just

sort of like try to like pass it over as

soon as your javelin intersects the

space above the reward ignites like in

fire it's like it's light and force

energy light and force

yeah that's bright so it makes light but

the actual damage was like bludgeoning

damage interesting so does it like stop

yeah okay so it's not like it just

brought me it's possible that you might

be able to overcome it but you are

physically knocked back as soon as as

soon as you touch the thing okay I

haven't

[Laughter]

people might have thought of somebody

like during someone like that solitaire

surely know it six do any eights I do to

bring it thank you that's a lot of eight

sided dice things the things that are in

here can we just sleep down here focus I

literally can the right no it's not it's

all your [ __ ] so that's n 20 31 16 is

41 and 6 is 47 we take 47 points of

damage there's no saving throw you were

slammed against the far wall oh yeah my

honey he's fine

it's loom he thinks I'm he's almost

extreme and very much hurting I'm gonna

I'm gonna like retune the mandolin a

little bit and play cure Williams

something about boots boots as playing

that is really really rejuvenating

so you get you get 3d eight plus some so

quick question yep so we're in this room

is a dead end

finally be able support and then but

basically if we go back into this main

atrium there's there's two new

passageways that outer outer ring

basically yeah let's find all the pieces

first maybe and then yeah this is

nonsense

this is above our pay grade I mean I

could try it

what do you instead of white right oh

it's bright it flashes yeah

you want to try touching that thing I

mean I've got it I mean if it looks like

the command rod and it's something we

can use to get through here it's

something we gotta get right do we still

have the command rod yeah I have it on

me are you gonna touch it with the

command rod

no I don't want the command rod to

explode don't we have a theme absorption

here's how a leech has no that's the he

has that but yeah the command rod that's

when a spells cast on you I see so I

mean we could try it but there's no

saving throw on this so what can't

bleach if leaves were conscious he could

read this right yes yeah yeah it's too

bad Matt Snyder fuckstick Jolie I can't

I can't revive him can you like I have

that sort of I had the thing where I can

just be like you know give him like one

HP recognizable ice well what you could

spend the gun yeah well I mean he's only

on keys not nikasha specific damage he's

unconscious because he's not here so I

could just decide time right now he's

late why don't you why don't you rpm

like you used to do in the past when

somebody was out like you just you just

play them you'd make with my own

character yeah but you were playing

cigarette and I was yes that was awesome

those were good times because then he's

in the party and can do stuff yeah and

I'm not gonna run his character

afterwards okay that's fine

[Music]

how does so how does his comprehend

doesn't have tongues or some [ __ ]

he has logically he can read and write

any language eyes of the rune keeper

that says location yeah so it's just

something you can do right

yeah he's able to he's able to decipher

the words and what does it say you're

idle hands are his tools what work shall

ye do with them

sirs

what work shall you do hmm that sounds

vaguely familiar to you to me

yep remember check I think it'd probably

be a religion I mean your your idle

hands are his tools

what work shall you do with maybe we

just need to ask it doesn't mean idle

hands like hands let no move or like an

idols hands like is the rest at it

spelled like idle as in lazy like as in

not I do L yes so it's basically like we

working for a god

Yeah right yeah I think because we are

the tools of our job right like we need

ya or ask the tools of fee and touch it

Lars either protect the wards of the

Emperor either does sound that does seem

like a it does vaguely trigger some

obscure memory that King has or even

just like praying for keywords happen

further into this obscure memory is

something for Lars to either do

something remember I guess I'll try to

do a religion check on that to see if I

know anything about it

[Music]

oh so hasty there's definitely nothing

there's definitely nothing your

religious background that there's

nothing in the training of alchemy -

that has anything to do with this phrase

it sounds like something you've read

something you check the cross on the

black Chronicle so have you figured out

how checking the Chronicle works it's a

history check history check yeah well

you look on yeah yeah I would say you

have advantage on some like this

somebody else

gorilla Khurana so it's history but you

might to age 25

so King I just pulled it open and it's

oh it's right there okay

King King King thinks for a second and

he knows he does actually it's that's

the reason the effect of the 20s he

knows exactly where it is and King

starts reading from The Chronicle in

those days the chain was in service to

Emperor Gaius the eighth third of the

five crusading Emperor's and 27th

Emperor of kailia Gaius continued the

crusade started by his illustrious grand

uncle those were profitable days for the

chain the wheel and the gate while the

other held troopers waited in the

deserts of course here in Kamara we

battled in the forest of as Mark we had

it easy

I hate deserts count wrodar von glower

waited until he was fulsome in his

strength before trying to extend his

dark realm into Caelian territory

thinking his vampiric power would save

him but we know how to deal with

vampires that's familiar the black and

gold standard of the von glower family

reads I do the devil's work we can

attest to that we lost many souls to

that long siege but in the end we staked

him an old woman howled at us saying he

is the land but we hear that stuff all

the time

we sacked his castle burned his forests

and as a word means it could be in

forests or orchard orchards and

delivered his staff to the Emperor that

was harder than it sounds

finger had to drop it into one of his

bottomless sacks to stop the mists from

coming what the Emperor will do with it

I don't know but I fear that staff may

hold more than the power to make the

mist follow us around remember you claim

it so judge are you a bad enough dude to

touch that second a leech repeats your

idle hands are his tools what work shall

you do with them like if you pick it up

it's probably a is he gonna ask you to

do something like the like has an ego or

something they said he's a vampire the

Emperor the Emperor put it here so

previously a vampire guy owned it

Jane took it returned it to the Emperor

the Emperor sealed it in here well if

the Emperor was the one that put the the

board on it he's not gonna make it so

another devil can come in and grab it is

he yeah well I mean but is that one

thing that that's his good lead over

yeah yeah you're idle hands I'm gonna

extend my hand towards the scepter and

say I'm here to do the devil's work

okay you don't get blasted away

but you put it close enough to be with

Oh with over the threshold

I'll wear the scepters that I mean I

stated my business nothing happened no

I'm gonna grab the scepter which grabs

the scepter I do not know how to react

to this it's like you seldom ask wait

math coin but you don't know how so you

can write down in a character shape that

you have the staff of count Rhoda von

glower COA you are how did you pick it

up he said the passphrase

it's a passphrase okay yeah maybe we can

figure out what this thing do how it

works huh I'll do it I have three little

spell slots one dices all put that thing

in the in the hole in the bag

yes evil vampires why why do you want it

yeah it's because

somewhat The Chronicle says it seems

like the Miss will be after us if

because they know where this thing is or

he can

that's why figure how to put it in a can

that's why I assumed really like I can

try it

we'll see how it happens so we gotta go

back through that room again well if the

myths are coming we need to put it in a

bottom of sack to keep keep it from the

mists they keep the mist from coming oh

that's all I knew I see resuscitate

butts yeah so one died so she'll have

one helpful okay okay what's comes to

thank you stall we do you have touching

things but without fully reading it read

the full sentence and menu you asked me

to and I was no buts it was a noble

attempt but nobody died how did you get

the staff

well we revived leach briefly and had

him read the runes Oh what does it do uh

well we don't know I was kind of hoping

you'd be able to identify it for us I'm

sure you looked sheet inspects it she

doesn't know what it is doesn't have

identified she's I'm identify no she's a

conjurer she's not uh I thought we

discussed oh hello I thought we had her

identifying stuff last yeah probably

that seems that seems for me

[Music]

but I think she's probably on spells at

this point yeah how many mmm I can

identify Oh identify it and then yeah

okay I don't like using it because it's

a first-level spell I can't I can't you

I can't cast as a ritual somebody ritual

casting no she's not a wizard

alright so

put my hands over it I think cast

identify it will the if it's attuned to

its owner and its owner is of the right

ethical axiom then it will among other

things it will summon vampiric mists and

you're pretty sure it has other

abilities but it's it's beyond the power

of your first level spell like I said

like a sage or somebody somebody was job

it was to learn the it's kind of boring

legend lore I'm gonna like concentrate

and try to summon a vampiric mist

nothing happens any sort of sense of

energy or anything any kind of a vibe

from a feeling it's really heavy like it

feels good in your hand

mmm right it seems almost new the

elaborate kind of Gothic patterns on it

seem like they are brushed off a

patterns on it known that we're nerds

evil sure leeches it's just stuff it in

my in my belt Lee just says it's a

vampire staff sir

it's almost certainly evil like what are

we gonna gain that we might be able to

use it for something that judge is the

only one knows that's name one evil I've

already got it seems certainly it seems

like us having that power would be

better than no one having yes sir or

somebody else getting game of course I

defer to you like even if we don't use

it we give I'm really glad you guys

I mean I'll I'll carry it if you're

worried I mean I guess what have you I

guess the black iron pack dirty knows

about this place so it's better our

hands then and also the laudanum to

figure out this we don't want it we just

to the yeah we can have her well yeah

this is one of this is the type of thing

about really want these things so

obviously extremely dangerous yeah

volatile mm-hmm relics and weapons and

things that could be used for a good

alignment touched it it really hurt them

oh she's talking about though she misses

a cliff we might need this to like you

know I see the red flickering in your

eyes get out here undo some wards and

unlock some some gates things like that

I'll put on the back you sure you want

to touch it yeah I mean so what happened

to slim mm-hmm force field well don't

take any damage touching his rod okay

just don't like I mean what does boots

do about all this are you an 11 grams

receptor it's fine

I'm you lieutenant I'll keep it in leech

leech stands behind you and says he

seems unnaturally protective of it sir

perhaps it already has a grip on him

let's see you really just want a little

dinner what do you want well maybe it

would be safer with me stop arguing over

your fantastic fine it's part of the

mission in the back in the bag yeah okay

another is vampiric miss coming out of

the back carried the bag it's like a

magical rod or whatever okay wiener hold

on you're moving this thing that's

covering the map up don't do that

what do you see the map it's the same as

before nothing's changed because I want

to know if it continues it does not

there's lines here since all the rooms

we got for now well yeah cuz we develop

hearing glow in the outer

right so this one this is the Septor

room this is where the mists were this

is kind of the foyer this is the room

with the crystal that is the room with

the trapped woman and there was nothing

in that yeah okay because there's like

it was like eight circles here that's

why I'm laughing so it's pretty good

circle but there's multiple anyways you

know maybe the metallic lining has

something to do with like containing the

mists from getting out of this this like

wing of I want to go back to the room

that we thought the black are impact and

you said they were a bunch of like

symbols along the wall I just wanna kind

of sketch those in the Chronicle for

later reference okay okay so at any

point of future if you guys want to

refer back to it you can just refer to

the Chronicle okay maybe it was like

maybe there the metal is like a way to

keep people from finding it likes crying

you know like Superman can see X many

feet deep I think it means you can't cry

it make a make a perception shock okay

eighteen it's led good thinking oh very

clever slim while you're sketching you

hear the sound of lady erosive are

waking up are we gonna do Sam I don't

know maybe we should just let it go what

is he good where is she going anyway

she's going to a church right she gonna

come back with more people and I mean we

haven't really gotten any information

out of her I don't know how we can do

that unless we have judge try to

intimidate her but she's not gonna like

Herod he did it before and then you guys

knocked her out and it's complete waste

we didn't knock her out she knocked

herself out yeah what well we suggested

that she do a thing that got her knocked

out but well uh Christ we've suggested

that she do a thing that got her knocked

out yes

come on the thing is like like

it seems like her being a gemstone

dragon could be oh yeah it could be a

you know part of the key to right

through somebody's worth she's pretty

weakened right now so we can let her

know that she almost took down the ward

and maybe if we rest and she rejuvenates

a little bit maybe she'll be able to

take down the board and get her hoary

yeah from musician on the ground where

you have laid our body so that you can

draw in your book she sits up in here as

a commander commander

I think that's she sang to you uh report

soldier I fear I was brash and hasty

with you earlier I apologize I was

overcome with zealous rage and she

stands up I'm better now don't worry

about it we don't like those guys either

so play you here are you in the room

with him why he's catching I think you

almost brought down the wall with their

psionic power

forgive my muddle-headed 'no switch wall

are we speaking up yes what I did what

you almost brought down the wall mmm

surrounding violin Thea we had you hold

the psionic crystal yes the woman who

escaped me yes we still need your help

we're trying to get her out of there so

that you can get her and we can extract

information from her yes I would very

badly like to take her back to the

church but I do not know how that's okay

I think we're finding clothes here in

this underground labyrinth

so I think we're getting closer and

closer to being able to get her out of

there yeah I think if you rest then

regain some of your power we might be

able to pull down the wall power of

sonic power from your gemstone heritage

so what what what did you do to make the

the I don't know how she would phrase it

like how would slim phrase using his

crystal like like she probably doesn't

think in terms of psionic charges that's

a that's again a mechanical term but she

just and I'm trying to imagine like what

she actually did like did she touch it

and then concentrate on bringing it down

like what what was she thinking about

you know like I did not use any of the I

did not fight the black iron pact with

the power of my mind

mm-hm and I spent everything I had

against that wall now I have nothing

hmm by rest yes my mind will be as it

was before but it will not be any more

powerful than it was would you stand

with us if we were to camp out here so

leeches rod is uh from the Sapphire

dragon with the oh yeah his fancy thing

yeah well his his patron is

theoretically the sapphire dragon did we

have him try to shoot a glass at it and

see what happened with that I don't

think we did I don't think he can't

because in the magic room unless he

shoots from outside yeah well even then

I mean we you try casting stuff from

outside right well I'm not yet willing

to abandon the woman inside the wall to

her fate so I will stay with you for now

alright but the church must be told of

this place

well but we need to be able to get her

out all right how long was I out

hour or so we must check on her

subterfuge we're in the room with her

right well yeah I mean we can go back

over there yeah I don't imagine that uh

Lady Vol entia has gone anywhere let's

go look lady Valentia is as lady of Rosa

Parks strives out down the corridor to

go inspect the trapped woman behind the

prismatic wall she walks into the room

the first manic wall is still there and

there's a the same woman that was there

before were kind of sitting with her

back against the far end of the wall and

she was like and Lady Rose of our calms

down a little bit but she does have kind

of walk around cat-like and inspects the

woman and taps the glass again and and

the woman inside says try using your

sword again you couldn't work this time

and lady or was were kind of sneers and

shows these big fangs and then she

returns to you folks and says trapped

yep well you guys are just best friends

huh yeah let's go let's go check these

other two corridors and then like call

it a night make camp do it stuff the

east corner or the West Corridor we're

on the outer ring now uh let's go left I

mean I could whip out the rod and show

it to Lady Pawlenty oh no whipping out

of Rods do your sword fighting later we

just wave monsters in people's faces

okay so we want to go this way sorry

okay sure sure well why don't we ask the

Dragonborn if she's been down any of

those pathways Dragonborn had even

any of these pathways no no no do you

want to check for tracks on the ground

to see if there's any recent because

obviously the black ground pack for down

here at some point so if there's a way

that they will matter what what is your

company doing down here if you don't

mind my asking uh we are ensuring that

the wards of ampere do not fall into the

hands of the black iron act and

therefore Ajax she's not what do you

mean when you say the wards of the

emperor which emperor in which Ward's

Emperor Gaius the eighth in this

particular case no this is a name this

is his history is not my strong suit

which puts our hand on our swar I need

to go get a manager okay actually this

room I can draw it is one two three four

five sixty feet across where are we can

you what okay so you give me your mouth

yeah oh yeah that goes the circle it was

such a beautiful yeah house nice cuz I

don't think we chose which hath we

wanted to go down death lawyers when I

ask so I was asking cops when you go

down this way you pointed on that I said

and I said wait we wanted to see it what

copper to check for tracks because I'm

good why do you guys want to go do you

want to check for tracks so I'm right at

the intersection between the left and

right side I'm just gonna look right at

that intersection

check for it see if I see any track D

for guidance okay 22 the only tracks you

see are yours

alright okay let's just keep going in

whichever way you've drawn

[Laughter]

I did well should I be more and then

there is a how do you know that this

dragon born isn't like also playing us

that she's not some kind of mole or

something uh as you see I not she's not

a mole she's a green dragon ah all

underground right now we're all [ __ ]

Jade I think Oh fine which is green

Sloane knows the stakes of the mission

so I'm not worried about it huh was I

had to do with ableton information I'm

just very suspicious like she came down

here she won't children cheer bear cage

and looking at the wrong Chris like this

oh well she chased she chased some of

the black iron pack down here I mean not

unlike we did she said she just what if

she's just in disguise as one of the

ones that got away it's pretty stubborn

around it too I mean I think that's

irrelevant because slim knows the stakes

the mission and slim knows what to do if

she tries to do oh I see what you mean

so from the top top camp that's some

bigan oh wow there's an even more like

outer that's great really wanna yeah

pull it back that little cool Oh another

ring yeah okay well native rings ring

well let's see this one and then this

one it's probably dead end well unless

it goes because we don't know if the if

it Oh

because if it goes down it could go

underneath that initial that's true

halfway pretty cool only we had

something like an 8 8 meters ok

abilities yeah you'll fly that way

always got the group still thing if I

think it's dangerous but I don't know if

this actually is that just like a kind

of like a passive thing that we can do

yeah hmm that's cool still it probably

wouldn't hurt cuz we're kind of just

exploring right now

and we don't want to triggering it yeah

yeah I'd rather get a jump on something

than the other way around yeah you got 3

da back oh yeah dude does anyone need

help because I still have a feeling

since you do okay like a lot of help I'm

below half okay does anyone else need

help I know I could uh I mean it's gonna

take 10 minutes but I could cast for

healing cuz I'll just an heal everyone

okay I was gonna use my healing spirit

on slim yes I mean go ahead and use it

good that's a lot of die so I don't know

if I should share it around

how 33 I'm starting to get low you see

how China

stone these days how big is that room

it's 30 40 50 60

can I use your D sixes yeah go ahead oh

that's what this thing is so privileged

to be 20 is that bug me

[Music]

watch it's just like running the game

episode 89 get one of these things you

should just have Jason build these and

for all the circles during the day so

you just haven't ready to go art

director are very expensive art director

here draw me push the circles on these

boards

where's the direction no I need another

marker because well it doesn't you guys

are coming from that direction and as

you can see on your map there are

there's a corner leading this way in a

quarterly this way

and there was a large it's actually 2 by

2 I believe stone statue yeah just

getting rat swarms I don't have any rats

one there's a bunch of stuff my

miniature collection is very strange it

doesn't make any sense it's a bunch of

crap that I do use yeah there is a giant

it looks actually almost when you walk

in it almost seems as though you

recognize the the figure that the statue

is it looks a lot like Marcellus Scipio

young young college war college student

who dressed in his family's military

gear looks like a Centurion is a Roman

centurion he's got the sword yeah is

there anything on sword that's like

heraldry I will no it's actually a it's

a it's a just a very old sword or a weak

enchantment huh it's not it's not like

finely made or anything like that it's

just been passed down from generation

maybe once a pop maybe a thousand years

ago it was a really nice sword but it's

like an heirloom yeah yeah is there any

heraldry on the on the statute that is

indicative of the Scipio family no no

there is a there is a it's got a like a

halberd and it's got a shield on the

shield is the device of heraldic symbols

that are in the caelian style but which

Emperor they refer to we thought one of

these well which I just came away yeah

the same in the library thing where we

fought the babadook I thought it was

ringing whoa a lot better monster no so

is there anything else in this room no

it's just the just the just some

experience point since then no it's got

the same writings on the walls the

ceiling the floor there are figures car

they look like what you expect to find

in an ancient like a Indian temple to

Vishnu or something like that right

where you left it the walls are stone

not metal no the only metal was the two

rooms they explored a slave wish I had

the vampiric Miss Bennett it's why cuz

they're that special scepter in there

yeah but it was also in the in the one

that the vampiric mists I wonder if the

lead is to like keep them in or what was

happening it's me the master and it's

not to stop them from just walking so

when you walk into this room yeah

the statue animates in charges Oh last

with your arrows comfort but the it

looks initially like it's made of stone

but actually that's just dust that's

accumulated on over the centuries so

just wear a dust it's actually as soon

as it starts moving it appears to be

made out of solid iron

yeah is it really big yeah it's large

it's two by two so that's it's not so

it's like an iron golem or something

yeah it is it's not a stone color i

stand by push melted it's gonna be

initiative but i believe you guys are

surprised i can't be surprised but

that's breast so I rolled it and got one

plus its charge yep course that's how it

works I think after this combat we'll

take a break okay I generally prefer

shorter sessions we have missing people

but Matt might know some snacks that eat

some cheese and when it charges like as

soon as you walk in it points at you and

it speaks in a language you don't

understand and then it charges language

is last last an hour

has it been an hour probably not I mean

you didn't know you did well you didn't

but he did sit there and write down

stuff and comprehend languages you know

if the touch enough I said you touch it

- read it - read a written language but

I can hear any spoken language oh it's

all so much for speaking you're just

like charging you attack 20 foot tall

guy hang on hang on okay maybe would you

get a - yeah you did definitely the goal

[Music]

it says the Emperor forbids charges hmm

hello let's see what can this thing do

quite a lot yeah iron dome's and ass I'm

not surprised by the way add the ione

stone no you knew this gonna happen yeah

I'm a I did meta Lee what's wrong class

armor class is 17

oh it just 17 it's just I'm not a good

I'm not a good Dungeon Master a good

Dutch master wouldn't make sure looks

like that

it's just mean you only get because of

charged only gets one attack oh you gave

me some of your back yeah okay

I'm not gonna roll the ones I can't read

about they're gorgeous you just can't

[ __ ] read oh and the fight thing is

that no the more the more oil they

absorb from your skill like this is one

this is one it has yeah color did sandy

until like I say I'm not gonna say what

brand to make a model cuz they're

gorgeous

I don't want people who made them to

feel bad or like they made a bad product

I just can't read the [ __ ] yeah

they're nice

thirteen plus seven is twenty you take

twenty points of bludgeoning damage and

you can do two attacks at least well in

this case it only did one because it

sure could you do me a favor and put it

next to boots so I just like take two

steps into this room Innes thing just

like this is not this is not a puzzle or

a trick it's just a car name and it's

just gonna it's job killing the egg is

not gonna necessarily unlock anything

it's not it's literally just this place

was not supposed to be here trap and

it's one of the things that makes you

not want to be here copper which

initiative 23:21 judge 18 slim named

order 14 awesome perfect thank you

you've been a very nice set it up for

you you've been fantastic you've been a

fantastic client group points I have a

question whatever you use your arrows

like the one for um like stone whatever

uh help

how much stone does it actually do so I

can just read it it's happening I think

what it does it just gets rid of it it

says excavate don't destroy and we're

having I thought of like crumbling stone

on top of him I was actually thing that

if you do it beneath the own every ten

feet oh no I told you what did you just

suggest I had suggest he used his Arab

excavating to get hit underneath the the

golem and I didn't know if golems could

climb out because it's 10 feet of stone

ax can just disappear and the golems 10

feet tall so it's just it's copper and

big cats giant this giant Centurion

statue it looked like it was stoned it

really was was just dust it's actually

made out of iron it charges forward and

it [ __ ] hammers

boots yeah it actually slammed its

shield into it's got a it's got a weapon

it didn't use it did that thing we're

always like that it like hits me

[Music]

classic like it didn't even quite

register he's 10 feet better you get

he's large large yep he's - bye - you

might - oh that get us slow him down me

it kills me that I don't have a [ __ ]

iron golem Minnie I gotta get strapped

them yeah see you later

yeah but like I don't actually don't

have a list if it is in my head it seems

cool but I don't know if it's worth

wasting an arrow over it looks like an

iron doll it's a nice little looking

thing that's all it is is a hero

it's a hero Minnie painted silk to make

it look like a statue I have I played

with friends Oh a pandemic who would

have different that the same miniature

for their character just painted

different stuff for the different like

if they've got turned to stone

yeah they're the version of their

character and they would have like a

plastic version yeah yeah nice thing the

plastic one that's probably imagining

what happened when they open the floor

into the room below that's full of diary

[Applause]

story where they're like the claws are

gone I'm sure that sounds interesting

I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot the floor with

the stone arrows drop it copper okay

okay

[Music]

it's on groans all the way down in that

manner I got you as a picture of King

with his hand his face can you change

that immense copper to do something

ridiculous pretty easy stuff make a roll

yeah cuz you might you might not hit the

floor you try and hit the floor beneath

the iron off yeah so that's still gonna

be a little a little trickier than just

shooting any random piece of crap okay

you're June 18

13 plus 11 okay so what happens if you

try to shoot the floor out from under

the icon I am Not sure I feel like maybe

just prepared mad unfortunately my my

thinking showed lack of imagination

two-dimensional I mean I feel like I

feel like the most interesting answer to

this question comes after a break oh

it's gonna happen it's gonna require me

doing a little bit of research so I

think we're gonna take a break and

they're gonna go have lunches and I'm

gonna go read ahead in the adventure

it's you know if you need to do research

it needs to be longer bring why because

I said so

I do need to do research okay some

minutes we don't know how many 15 18

minutes we will be back try to make it

13 we'll see what happens thanks forever

is left after all the crazy shenanigans

that we've been up to recently thank you

for hanging in there this is the point

where we show off a fan art and

otherwise make a talk about anything

that's going on me to talk about

obviously if you have an Amazon Prime

subscription and you want to support

your local streamer you get a free

twitch prime sub every month that you

can send to whoever you might like it

could be anybody and we've got a patreon

if you want to support us more directly

and other patrons and $5 levels and

above get to see my notes or the

adventure which is a lot of fun I like

sharing that stuff and I often put notes

in there knowing people are going to

read them and we've got a store with

strongholds and followers in it and our

new dope t-shirt designed by Tom schmuck

who is currently working on t-shirt

number three for Kickstarter number two

and I think that's all the announcement

a Kickstarter notification you know if

you want to get alerted when the

Kickstarter goes live you don't miss it

there's a link you can click on and you

give us your email address and we will

email you once to say hey Kickstarter is

live we're not gonna sell your email we

have no idea how to do that and even if

we did we wouldn't do it because we try

not to be evil because of the nonsense

we get up to here people are

occasionally inspired to create stuff

based on our adventures and exploits and

we like to show that stuff off this is

the pan our naked boobs of course

classic Oh bollocks

Amir Hey definitely alive this artist

drew this as it was happening which I

thought yeah because the slim bait had

this big recollection of that machine

being like a cop

Sally thanks oh yeah the triptych is

done three of the people who judge was a

coward all three of the people who

called upon their reviews I believe the

title of this is concordance leach as it

turns out no you didn't leach calling

upon his patron Hugo is g1z all right

that's like a that's like a legit like

kids in high school should be like

carving that into their PJs this is them

running in and all getting common

doesn't monster is that me sitting in

the back is that supposed to be butts

yeah yeah this is great

take on a Jim stone dragon yeah it's

like

I think that's cool that looks Carol

yeah it's it's opalescent is it supposed

to be like a pearl yeah I use

rattlesnake tail so copper shoots and is

what's the name of your arrow it's got

their name right excavation or something

like that ex excavate stone head right

the stone headed arrow named excavate

and he successfully strikes the stone

but beneath in between the golems feet

and a 10 foot wide section of floor

shatters shards of it fly up and the

whole thing goes and the iron golem

reaches out actually boots the iron

golem reaches out he has a slim chance

you've got your fancy boots on it's not

fine and prone trying to go which they

are class was 1719 it grabs boots and

boots and the iron golem fall in the

title of this episode would be the law

of unintended consequences the first

time and it said that's [ __ ] well I

think that means we're we're done for my

room well it depends so that's that was

copper combat continues the good news is

if you can kill this thing by yourself

down there definitely worth like at

least one level maybe two all right so

like try and grapple I guess doesn't

matter if I could grab a Ledge it's an

iron it's like it's easy when it's iron

grip so no no I was looking for

what if I cast my charm is next what if

I cast hold person on boots what's that

gonna do is gonna be paralyzed down

there I'm nimble I can yes you spider

walk up the wall with boots that was

those best Dagmar I needed by turning

into a spider so yeah it's a copper or

you've got more arrows and movement you

could use diggy diggy hole so either

broke down there now

yep so can I get the pen and we'll just

take them off the board and draw a

little circle or something yeah whoa oh

there's actually if you look on the I

don't know where we need we need more

than one marker because if you look on

the case the bookcase you guys bought

yes there's a bunch of markers in but

what stole what did you I don't know

didn't you buy it

if we could lift the four billion pound

piece of wood and we did yeah well we

authentic junk from nineteen seven

me Jason Tong and Tom are we Jason Tong

you should come by my yes we probably

come hang out yeah you hear boots go hey

let's yeah you guys are just in there

together what's down there yeah if I

look down that gonna look down are you

going to look down I just looked my head

yeah just not going down well you see

another room it's also round has

different dimensions than this one

it's smaller and there is

I don't have my like in the middle of

the room which is below this one there's

a statue of Pegasus yeah but they didn't

fall on the Pegasus they felt like

mm-hmm the Pegasus is basically here

okay okay how far oh there is so copper

are you done oh they're exciting I have

the completely unexpected development I

warned everybody off screen that if they

want to explore the level below this one

we're all gonna stop so I can go prep

that because I did not did not

anticipate this which I don't like I

think that's cool when the players like

we want to go off in this crazy random

direction I'm like awesome it just means

we got a break yeah I don't think that's

I don't think that's a problem but the

players might know how I do that

and I don't want you guys to be like but

wouldn't it be bad for the stream no

don't think that way okay do what you do

what you want to do now I feel like

people more people tune in next week

knowing that you guys went off the rails

and this is the level 7 part you guys

are now down to level 13 art I've got

that I've got that mechanical arrow that

if he shoots it he'll teleport to the

things yes that's great yes

uncomfortable yeah definitely no drop

the arrow to him so he can shoot it back

up Oh mmm copper jump into my arms only

take myself are you done

alright I can only take I can only take

yeah when you shoot it I meant if he

shot it yeah but he does not have a bow

unless you want to drop your bow super

also which is ridiculous

well copper it's your turn are you done

no not yet okay take your time

mm shoot jump so that's thinking I don't

know how beep it is yet you're pretty

strong so you grab them and jump with

them it's like the floor is about 20

feet down 20

anything is he gonna strength 20s that

wouldn't space off yeah okay I throw it

down to you and then you shoot it oh he

doesn't have a boat though oh it's a

crossbow or he is yeah the weird right

is there here's a hand crossbow that

would not fit there was neither on arrow

a longbow short bow or even a regular

crossbow arrow which fit in that thing

they use basically like darts what if he

just through era I see we have like rope

or something then we definitely yeah I

definitely have her at least yeah bro I

might just like the copper toss some

rope down or something you're gonna pass

on a second yeah so few seconds I'm

gonna say okay yeah pass got it yep okay

yeah I guess okay King are you gonna do

the jump thing otherwise it's 20 feet

down I don't have not it I'm I can reach

up and grab something sixteen point six

feet off the ground you you yeah I have

a thing I also have a thing so what is

the what is the room can we can you draw

where the whatever I'm just gonna do it

so I'm gonna cast imagine this room I

mean yeah I made a shadow behind him

okay so temper radius attempt okay and

not boots as the end up its yeah I'm

gonna occupant to it to max it inorganic

things as disadvantage this is a spell

correct yes

okay I'll read the spell I different I

got it

magical I don't see there's made of

inorganic materials such as stone

crystal and metal have disadvantaged on

the saving throw the saving throw is

like on I think it's called yeah what's

the DC 15

makes it okay then he takes half of

weight disadvantage though right

oh he has correct okay resistance 12

Thunder damaged half of 24 you see like

there's a this detonation boom and a

little bit you know the iron Gong can um

okay see you I got the ring of air or

something something yes ring yes correct

uh it has something in it that I think

might be helpful in this situation maybe

but I don't have the stats for it and

I'm a separate for it

it's the it's a ring of elemental

command yes

it's under M for elemental so that was

King correct yep judge [ __ ] take your

time I don't know if judge have the ring

a bell month look man yeah it is a alloy

it is a highly manufacture yeah see it

has a question it has a question not a

question as a being on here that says

you have a flying speed equal to your

walking speed and can hover do it does

that mean I need to cast fly first for

that to take effect so it doesn't mean I

can just fly what does it say you have a

flying speed equal to your walking speed

and can hover yes I can just like that's

what that means

fly fly Wow that's why I was trying to

figure out because I was like wait I had

this ring that does this thing can I

read that yes cuz I think there's a

thing you gotta do oh don't you tune to

it to use it probably how do the tuning

worked I just put it on sir

you have to like them like sleep right

so that that statement you have a flying

speed equal to your walking speed and

can hover

the the thing before that says you have

resistant to lightning damage the thing

before that says if you slay an error

elemental while attune to the ring you

gain these properties can you summon it

your elemental so I can slay it that's

true that's true butts butts has been

walking around for like for like the

past four weeks of our game time with

the ability to summon elementals because

she just gets knocked out all the time

so they Dani go AWOL I think mutts would

do it don't you yeah I think present she

would she could get so many honors with

all the time why do you think she has

the ability

why would showered that's why no she's

are you kidding but isn't a coward she's

the opposite [ __ ]

yeah she's brash she's like she's she's

too curious to run the air elemental

down to distract the iron golem while we

pull I could cast vampire mists down

here I think that was thing thank you so

how are the vampire miss going to pull

health out of metal mr. smarty pants

listen so George have you done any of

the sand timer I'm gonna cast I'm gonna

cast darkness actually attack the

darkness okay so yeah I mean it has

darkness down there and at a point where

it won't affect boots that it will put

this die okay just to try and further

delay anything that guy might do um

thank you goodbye minutes ask and ye

shall have a shorter wonder we got three

minute timer anyway and then

thank you very often that's it he was

like a star vision okay that was that

was judge slim

I don't think someone's gonna need that

but I mean little help down here

well I can't I can throw a rope down and

pull you up do you or do you want me to

come down there with you you just go

down and kill it it's 20 feet I'm gonna

how much damage you guys already hurt

yeah um

plus I have used like all my like I've

I've already done my slim burst so like

I don't have that available death

blossom yeah and the death blossom

exactly my crystals all charges well

it's not out but it doesn't have enough

for me to what's that you could put the

Rope down on its journey to pull it up

maybe I'm gonna go rest

that's very very tactical and strategic

of you and not at all Battlemaster

character growth yeah you know he'll

like alright yeah you see a rope come

down sweet boots how did you get down

there wasn't easy

and now the the iron golden goes do you

think never mind nothing so well the

iron golem surrounded by darkness but

the good news is that's dark vision it

doesn't start vision won't work just

dark vision works even against magical

dark vision doesn't work have a thing

that lets them see through that's true

and bows to you this is a warlock off

that's why I has a simmer in the shield

make sense yeah absolutely yeah so I

know yeah one one it disadvantage with

its shield AC 23 hips and one with its

Halberstadt disadvantage 7 AC 20 assume

it's yeah right

how do I like further broke down he's

gonna be like yeah just Tyler up around

yourself real quick around your throat

because it's at work so it's a 3d hatin

okay let's do different eyes here you

need some more D eights and then three

of these oh good lord

actually how much damage we've done to

this thing first round again then

advantage 31 points in average I'm down

ba Mei

are you did not outright dead okay more

than 31 hits is elemental no it's not

good no so what's it do

once he's down let's continue to mother

that's both of its that's both of its

attacks so that's it's gonna be done for

now it might you know yeah okay it might

like I have a place on foot come over is

I have a good I make an observation

you're dead or you're unconscious can

Tom's manic and I'll be okay sure yes

just a sprinkling if meta on top of this

yeah little doodoo Sunday leach correct

the accompany surgeon yeah is conscious

retina CLE conscious yeah the best kind

of conscious

and he has the special ability when you

go unconscious when somebody goes

unconscious correct he would have to go

down there then yeah but he'll do it as

a reaction his what his ability is the

thing is I don't know because well it's

not

he has fly he does but he's gonna get an

attack of opportunity and they just

[ __ ] squishiest Shh anything and then

he's gonna fly they're both good two

guys fly on me and I'll go get him

I'll take the opportunity hey would you

help boots don't even I'm sure he would

say yes I have mage hand oh I can just

have the hand tie tie the rope around

his ankle and yank him up yeah that's

true that's true let's do that I mean if

you guys want to hold your hold your

turns yeah it's gonna take you I could

try it using the mage hand and then

someone else pulling them up yeah cuz

you using it less mhm and as a bonus

action well I mean I've already got it

like sort of like yeah you can't cast

this you can't cast the spell well it's

not a special can trick or something

right well it's still not Yogi's you

know it's it's yeah I'm not concerned

about the spell it's mostly like is it

an action or reaction well what I'm

thinking is that if my action is casting

or you know doing the thing yeah

tying the knot and then I do my movement

yeah yeah fair enough that's better yeah

under set that would work okay don't

holes we can we can all heave-ho it you

sure yeah yeah at least I mean we're

strong yeah yes right so you guys gonna

hold and let me try this so boots

Megadeth save

19 you're fine you're not dying and now

it's the Goblin with the top hat and the

blood couple armor on top of a light

bender mm-hmm it's exciting I mean you

can still attack them this is crazy

yeah I won I column turns craziness I

assumed it so where is the stone air at

this point down there somewhere yeah

it's down in the rubble um it takes like

a bonus do you think it's gonna take a

lot more that you have to sift through

all those okay you know several hundred

pounds were a stone it's down there a

pile and underneath it somewhere is your

arrow okay I'll get it later then um

I'll get Sigma okay you have to move up

to help with the rope in either okay and

then I'll just shoot at it I'll shoot at

the goal in from here uh okay can you

see it oh there's darkness dark blood

rights and the darkness hmm you can

shoot the darkness can actually shoot

the darkness like that use that area

it's just like it's no different than at

all in being invisible or you're being

blind it's literally all the same I

think oh sure so the lowest one is 16

miss probably a pink pink lowest one

yeah you're gog here it's it's copper is

definitely hitting the iron golem it's

just not at the right angle it needs to

do any damage so they just you're the

Spang Spang

uh let's see it's King I'm holding my

king holds his action judge I'm also

holding my action a judge holds his

action slim all right so I used my my

mage hand power yeah my understanding of

a Chan is that it's certainly capable of

tying I'm gonna tie it around his ankle

okay so it's quick good yeah that's fine

yep

yeah and then I'm just gonna start just

gonna move yeah and these guys are gonna

move with you so all three now we're

gonna go what kind of with Slash after

slim and there's definitely no danger

that you were gonna fail like boots

isn't heavy enough for it to be mm-hmm a

problem the iron golem reaches it now

yeah okay so you are able to pull slim

up out of I mean up out of the pit and

it's completely and you hear this you

hear this kind of like this sound of

almost like a bell ringing of metal on

stone yeah yeah we need to go hide

somewhere otherwise there's gonna be

like a mobster people will be like he

seems pissed about something that's my

BOB let's see where he goes but my only

worry is that Pegasus those down there

yeah hey boots before we do that one D

eight plus four so I was reading a

really good post on reddit about rules

to make the game feel grittier and one

of them your only one which I'm not

going to use tonight because I think we

kind of bogus to bust it out without

warning is that every time you go

unconscious when you come back you

accumulate a level of exhaustion so

that's like you just take a long rest

and it goes away but I actually like

exhaustion I think it's cool and I wish

there were more mechanics that use it

and in order to further the goal of

making going unconscious actually seem

like it has a weight as opposed to

something that is trivially easy to

recover from starting next week where

you use a cool until it turns out to be

stupid and I hate it and then we go back

to boy I'm gonna climb I'm gonna look

down in the room I don't see him anymore

I'm gonna climb down

yeah I've dissipated darkness okay

stealthily okay okay

yeah we just tie it we could just tie it

around yeah quick comment on the

exhaustion thing

yeah that's fine me it just means you

guys are going to deal with what gosh it

needs a long rest though do ya remember

how we we used to play would be like one

combatant okay well what that'll mean is

that you guys are gonna deal with a lot

more random encounters yeah so it's

gonna take a look at if is gonna think

it goes a lot longer to get that long

their benefits that long rats because

it's gonna be okay all sorts of crazy

[ __ ] walking around the dungeon trying

to [ __ ] with you guys so just in case I

my new stealthily I wrote 13 I don't

does anything I mean go down I'm gonna

try to rummage through the so like all

right so the rebel slim lowers you want

to review so Tom Cruise right before he

touches the floor yeah all right yeah

I'm just gonna rummage through that

rubble

alright how long are you gonna spend

what do you let's make an investigation

check Gaiden touch I do you can do this

top center much okay also I did a blasts

one minute 12 you know find it okay yeah

well we can check back and I'm really

get to this room yeah I assume I assume

after that one check it's just like that

sure nobody else is looking for it it's

gonna take a group effort to stay yeah

like there's a ton of maybe even a well

I don't know I don't know how much like

three feet deep 10 feet 10 by 10 of

stone wood way okay but there's gonna be

lost don't tug on the rope and then well

how long does it take us to investigate

I dropped a couple of us a group effort

we just got to do it before he catches

back up to this room yeah I don't want

to leave one of our [ __ ] best magic

items down there well we know where it's

at

well mighty God trust me this thing yeah

I was think to only just come when we

circled round to this room again and

search for it again alright Walmart

right now we're all pretty [ __ ] up so

pull most of the way up and then I'll

let go

whoops that gives you a little copper

Capri emerges from home do you have a

hit point at 5:05 just as effective 5

hit points is like your goes rests yeah

like you we go back to this thing right

here do we want to go back to the

sausage shop and rest so we're gonna do

what the [ __ ] that's going on down I

don't know if I wanna go all the way

back that's before yeah area we went

through where we got attacked by the

[ __ ] yeah there's like other like

dungeon

yeah just like one other room where the

drugs that was all the cut balls and

stuff there's like five rooms that you

guys explored slash cleared out some

branches and stuff tell me guys is it

far

I mean it's it's about that much it's

about that much space yeah like it's not

gonna take a long time quote-unquote to

get back you guys know where you are

right I don't so explore it you can just

go I mean I'm just here because I'm so

worried about monsters we're doing the

whole watch thing to your monsters I

think if we go out of the dungeon well

I'm sure when we come back through here

the Hangul you'd back what if we put

like a tweet can we just guy is the hole

yeah like put like a blanket over here

so we get like a minor illusion we could

just like cover it or something so he

doesn't know anybody who just runs into

it again put a carpet down yeah that

idea but now we know what we're up

against so like whenever we do a long

rest will be able to prepare our stuff

at least for like the goal and take care

of the golem and some other [ __ ]

ODST yeah a lot we got where he has

screaming that we should rest I guess

it's like is every good lost chopper

what do you want it at least maybe a but

there's a lot isn't there a lighter in

that room at the very top there yeah we

climb down a ladder if we go to the top

of ladder

it funnels it or at least funnel anyone

trying to get to us golems can't climb

probably I don't know that ladder was

like embedded into the wall right yeah

hmm okay there's a middle letter yeah

you probably came out at the top of the

ladder yeah yeah yeah yeah all right

well let's get here at least Jen and

then I'm gonna take 10 minutes to cast a

feeling that's gonna be 2 d 8 + 4 4 is

that for everybody

uh that is for 6 creatures so anybody

who's hurt not me I'm not hurt he's not

hurt so if you won on the dragon lady Oh

actually do one on butts to get butts of

soft bubbles back and uh dragon lady

gets 16 hit points back cool

wait are we doing a long rest or a short

rest I was just doing that before we're

just in case cuz I might as well burn

like get if we do get attacked by

anything I just want a little bit more

help and I can't cast that in combat

right when does my native 10 HP parental

arrest ok we have no taking a long

restaurant no yeah for that matter I'm

gonna go ahead and do a couple of couple

of relay to the reassuring mantras yeah

it

[Music]

so what are you folks doing at the top

of the ladder

okie-doke and are you guys taking watch

are you guys just all gonna sleep

soundly all together innocent trusting

certain that you've cleared out the

dungeon thus far and certainly nothing's

gonna come attack you I'm gonna

basically just like throw down like

whatever kind of yeah and then we'll say

all I need is each lead some boots will

take lots of slim and judge take second

well no no no because we both have dark

vision right I do not you don't have

dark vision you have dark vision you

don't I can you down yeah but we can

both cast light

he's already asleep into so good and he

only needs four hours

he's drought each can be up late

well leeches the last yeah watch yep

sounds good okay so I'm out of risk of

course he would help boots no he doesn't

he does people information tell me don't

need him he has the only reason he

writes I just like the the vision of

boots getting pulled up by a rope by his

ankle what's your health at now I was a

good call 36 now 36 42 42 well what

about you bill well if we're taking a

long rest I'll get all my [ __ ] back but

I'm a little 66 at 81 right Martin

Martin Martin Mike too did the math and

assuming that the flittle stone is made

under granite it would be about five

thousand pounds or two and a half tons

with stone yet Sisyphus it's not granted

it's sandstone it's the same volume as

it would be the single heavy yeah

probably broke apart more when it hit

well yeah they're their own sense there

are a few big chunks there are a lot of

medium chunks and there's a whole bunch

of like now it's like dirt sand

basically

dagmer was here just mold earth yeah

that cleaned up in no time

yeah no doors in this party nope no they

know better I mean like stone shape

tomorrow so I'm sorry who's on do me a

favor and just like put like sort your

characters out which watch her on thank

you - awesome awesome Thank You Lars one

two three four five six king copper mmm

the rest of the group is asleep this is

a guaranteed I assume you folks don't

sleep in your armor actually it's up to

you folks if you sleep in your armoire

you have to make a contract otherwise

you accumulate a level of exhaustion

that is guaranteed a level of exhaustion

of USERRA

um well but maybe but I think it should

require a Constitution check that seems

work fair what uh what if you sleep in

Carmel is their fancy clothes off it's a

con if it's a contract I'm gonna sleep

in my armor yeah me too crash the mods

knows whether or not it's in a contract

or just it's automatic but I'm gonna say

it's a contract right now so if your so

the rest of you folks are asleep and

King and a copper you hear this grinding

sound

ah Tamizh that's me wanker with age

grayness a half hours guide everything

sleeping in light-armed has no adverse

effect on women sleeping in medium or

heavy armor makes it difficult to

recover fully during a long rest when

you finish a long rest during which you

slept in medium or heavy armor you

regain only one corner of your spend hit

dice in a moment one if you have any

levels exhaustion arrest does not reduce

your consumption

oh really we're complicated than I

thought it was I agree I'm not sure that

I'm not sure I feel about that rule so

yeah King you and copper what's a

sleeping - the only meditates that's

true same thing with buses and Vanya and

an OD sits there Yanks boy tries to

continually distract lead and tunneling

out of the ground are these three

bizarre creatures that appear to kinda

they almost look like thought worms at

first because there you see these male

with the seats these toothy maws going

up on the ground but as they emerge and

you see their eyes there's like that

several eyes ringing the the mouth of

teeth and again just like eyes like

where you would expect eyes on a worm to

be but then there are arms they reach

out and it's kind of got this rocky

spiny surface to it and it appears to be

trilaterally symmetrical like it's got

three legs and three arms

and three eyeballs mmm in the mouth is

love Tommy Pete what in the mouth silly

a silly game played by silly people

the dwarves boys the dwarves are these

things is Sauron mommy and slim slim may

have seen slimming be familiar with

these creatures

yeah maybe yeah cool

good lord it's initiative there's a

sleeping - yeah well I assume you guys

are gonna get woken up at some point

higher compared to its maybe maybe King

and copper can just deal with these

things on their own and won't even have

to disturb your sleep

I'm still asleep

ah I also fell asleep wait I'm gonna use

for this new just means your old Rollo

yeah Oh copper and big cat which is

eight fling six awesome judge I lovin

boots nine King Wow

the movie no before that but I saw this

remember that's why that dog movie

really came out and I was like Lars will

and so I got it for you lies is a

present for you it's funny it's made

with real dentures Hey look our normal

layout is back

is okay first I'm gonna do disengage

bonus action I can disengage okay I'm

gonna go you can keep it but if you put

it on myself what's going on oh I

haven't changed my shop and then no I'm

having a great time by the way yeah you

can't these aren't as easy as you

thinking it's really hard to do you got

it's it's really just vibrating your

lips against it yeah that's strange

you're not best form blower so everyone

gets seven every no point well they have

to be able to hear you right yeah they

won't go well come on I guess yeah that

weeks are we up it's loud yeah well it's

annoying it's annoying we're all awake

yeah you're awake I'm awake stand me up

it takes half your movement to stand up

okay and move me forward one so that I

can chip chop that [ __ ] that's good

yeah chippy job all right sumbitch Japan

in Chaplin so dirty slim make a history

check is 311 okay did I get a short that

no it's the first watch okay sorry give

me a second or third watch does a 14 hit

no it's gonna it's got a stony hide give

me a step it's not hard it's not hard to

hit it's hard to penetrate it's yeah

second attack elemental exterior

18 hits no seriously seriously

well [ __ ] is a little worm thing they're

made of stone actually judge might know

a little bit about these go ahead make a

roll these creatures are not native to

this plain history yeah well yeah

probably all right I'm gonna use the

superior already died and use a

precision attack yeah that is that

that's that's what you're fighting oh

wow that's what you're fighting that I

thought a nice medium does a 20 yes good

news good news everybody

I thought they're just like worms to

come out ya know well it's because they

because their mouths are on the top of

their of their body and they can mmm

anyway got it it's not distracting me at

all it doesn't if I'm Lars it by freak

milk 16 days I go get 16 damage I'll go

get Jason's Cthulhu monster and she

would be mad at beyond myself that

thing's gonna appear around the office

yeah your grubby mitts on my stuff I

wish I would have seen where your hands

have been I say 16 at 17 or 17 yeah

that's fine that's number one yeah well

then as you know just just to make sure

because we're gonna rest eventually I'm

gonna use my second wind

as a bonus action I get some hit points

okay that was slim now all three Zongo

the horn when you when you attack with

your sword mmm and it goes kind of chew

and spangs off of the stony hide of the

Zorn the Zorn's eyes auto follow and

they all follow your sword around his

mouth go stop book that comes trying to

eat your sword Zorn uses it as a villain

action nom nom the thorn uses its

reaction to try eat any metal weapon it

was just attacked oh go ahead and make a

deck safe nine nine so you're it

grapples its mouth clamps around your

sword and it doesn't be like it and it's

it's arms reach up and try to it's

wrestling with you with your sword

that's what that one does and then that

Zorn is next to boots mr. fancy boots

and you're awake right boots

[Music]

well actually yeah the Zarn uses its

earth glide movement to go into the

ground it submerges under the ground and

the hole fills in behind it and then you

can see the this is not the elaborately

worked sandstone of ring well this is

more like excavated dirt and mud and you

can see under the ground where it's

moving and it moves underneath it was

underneath boots it tries to undermine

him just comes out

what's your class boots 17 AC of 20 what

before I sell it for missed you mama but

it gets two more contacts with one by 17

okay the first one missed the next two

hit and the bite attack is a quick I

don't know this is nothing personal I

apologize

[Music]

it doesn't do it [ __ ] gonna damage you

take 12 points of flash and damage from

its two claws and you take 13 points of

damage from its bite and you are

restrained so you see that boots is at

the same astonishingly and purely by

coincidence the same ankle that slim

used his mage hand to tie a rope around

the likes like boots is still lying on

the ground and the Zorn is buried except

for its little mouth at the top of its

body is gone John is holding on is

holding on to boots is leg that's horn

number two Zorn number three

you okay yeah just gonna do the same

thing that's going to attack you it's

gets three attacks two attacks two paws

hit and one bike right is it quickly

oh I'm sorry um you take another 13

points a nap because I forgot that that

last bite was a crit so you take 26

points of damage from the bite and how

many of the claws hit I think to one or

two yeah you got three claws to closet

so you take another twelve points of

damage and so 38 yeah and then at the

once it's done once it's attacked you

and it's done moving it goes burrows

into the ground until only like its

eyeballs and its mouth or visible we

still jacket it's just gonna be art of

it I'm just gonna squish his eyeballs

easy easy peasy what could be easier

that was all three of the Zorn

it is now is it King yep guys Marysville

gonna come save your ass is he on his

way you know it's not I don't think this

guy would like low ground

no he's currently grappling with slim

yeah with his weapon yeah kill them all

so I just in case you roll a 20 aslim

these things don't have hands yeah yeah

before you move that this is I says ring

well is elf board no heads

that's not gonna make that mistake twice

look this is the this is how these guys

excavated this thing my tree it's in

King Stern oh no I'm just some Counting

squares now that cool butts yes no BOTS

you can't kill butts butts has a date

with destiny

stop I mean you know gotta break a few

eggs is bigger than the way for anything

sweet leads yes that would be in

character for logs yeah huh the thing in

front of you is that the one that's

submerged yeah yeah but before he moved

I'm like oh well I could probably

fireball him back there and then they'll

move it's like well now they're all in

range but it would it would actually

annihilate butts and I see not all right

link tactically as me yes I would do

that anyway we driver that's yeah but

King with you else role playing yeah I

need a better you know what I'm saying

yeah I've never done does he get an

attack of opportunity since he's

submerged no okay sorry yeah I'm gonna

do a sort attack oh yeah it's probably

not gonna hit that's a sixteen you're

correct but I'm going to priest of zeal

and see stuff real 18 plus six hits it

does correct that's a nineteen AC

they're made of stone the one that's

buried is it heart of it but not

impossible

seven points slashing damage from a

magical sword this is the same one

slimming tactic right yeah so that's

number one

seven points a damage yep oh and a magic

sword

oh yeah that's a magic sword okay are

you downwards no oh so you you got such

a health back before you when I

remembered why I never used they got

healed why because a commander ability

is a bonus action so I can still do it

because the seal thing oh that's a bonus

action yeah that was King it's now judge

stop judge Matt and then I'm gonna go

ahead and cast magic missile yeah so

many castes I don't think I've ever seen

Church cast magic man it's just in a

long time I'm gonna go ahead and cast I

think all three at the one between boots

you know

yeah just will damage it automatically

hits you see these three hell fire

photon torpedoes go came it from judges

finger and autoplay my my haven't slam

into the thorn that is trying to eat

slims blade so I do 11 damage mister

fancy boots which one did you attack the

one between you guys but you the one

that's chewing on your foot oh right the

one who's banging boots yeah okay I

thought you were taking the same one

they would they would know those two

probably have that guy hit a little

little worried about that guy 11 damaged

you sir mmm-hmm yes so that's number two

now okay so that's this one yep so it's

underneath me alright yep and it has my

foot correct in its mouth yeah so yeah

I'm just gonna I'm gonna [ __ ] stick

this black iron rapier right and it's

stupid yellow eyeball please do

that's a 20

yeah yeah yeah it's actually actually no

it doesn't oh he's trying something all

right well this sucks

this is awful nope I'm sorry I feel so

bad let me go back a step I feel

terrible um can I can I try actually

actually can I hang in a minute right he

does he has used his undermine ability

he did not use his sink ability those

are two different things

so the one that's grabbing boots is

nowhere near as submerged as the one

sorry as the one fact alone yeah they're

two different abilities so you see this

armor class is still 19 okay so I'm

gonna the one you're older to today yeah

I'm going to would add my little

defensive maneuver to this as well so

[Music]

great 0:07 cool yeah that was is this

the same when you attacked yeah yeah no

I wonder if it's all the list like an

attack at the enemy attack if you'll

either win or lose it shows you all the

monsters you're killed I wonder if

there's a list of on the wiki and

everything you guys have fought I used

to keep track of everything that we

killed then I gave up so that's 23

points of damage

right yeah point three yeah but he'd

only hit once right only hit one second

attack did not copper and big cat okay

and I like I still can't I can't just

like try and move you can draw it would

be a it would be your action and it

would be a it would be a backrub addicts

or athletics check to try to escape to

travel well I've used my action I'll

shoot so the one that's currently not me

on boot is easy it's the same it's the

same as buddies it's not getting any I

can't use it sync ability and it's

undermined ability the same time

it's one of them 17 misses 16 plus 11

Emily yeah 10 damage and which one

you're talking the one holding slim slim

sort of you damage yeah and then I'll

tell you guys are doing exactly the same

with a damaged teacher doesn't know tact

big cat it will attack that's what cuz

I'd Bennett that ones underground Oh

it's in me at 21 right the one attacking

the one was hacked King has a ceased

when you're right because all you can

see is little eyeballs his mouth but it

is Avenged yeah that's my favorite Lord

or rock the chain didn't kill red

relatives lives right that was in

reference to just the list of things the

chain is killed 22 yeah yeah this is the

one sweet yes Miss Granger

but when I was a big shame big thing you

did yeah do without your training turn

damage damage you notice that which

which one that went number two yeah the

one else merged oh the one that was

actually Sabri that's number three he's

has not yet been hit and you notice that

the big cats tentacles are not as

effective masa

because it's made of it's an elemental

from made of stone it's a super

naturally resistant creature that was

copper and be counted slim sleeping this

thing's grabbing onto your weapon I'm

[ __ ] yank in the night okay it's

gonna be a stretch check yeah

opposed strength check mm-hmm and this

will accoun was interacting with an

object so you can still take your action

if you get it free mm-hmm and you have

to beat I'll just say right now

something a 22 it still got Europe you

like you see slim rustling through there

all right so okay so that was my action

no that's I would say that counts as

interacting with an object so you can

still take your action but it's got your

sword okay so can I use my action to

keep trying sure if you want to yeah if

you want to convert your action into it

is your movement and use it to try to

interact with an object you you could do

if you have anything else that would

hurt it like you could just charge from

your psionic thing and play it you could

nice another weapon no I don't have I I

didn't either I don't have the charges

okay thank you try again

attempt I counted as interact with an

object which is something you can do and

move well I mean I want to stay in the

fight

and we can it's not gonna attack your

weapon because you did not hit it with

let's see bring it

the Zorn that that slit so slim pulls

his vorpal blade free and scores the

inside of this thing's mouth and it's

claws and they're bleeding and it gets

really angry

and it starts vibrating you guys all

have to make the room has to make Dexter

use checks 1815 dextrous everybody who

failed to beat a 13 so if you if you

rolled a 13 or higher mm-hmm you take

seven points of damage if you rolled 12

or lower you take 15 damage okay yeah I

dodge this Oh but even the average was

you see as this this thing like it

creates these sympathetic vibrations

with the whole room and rocks and

boulders start falling out of the

ceiling and boots is like wow and dodges

out of the way but one of them goes crap

and Cooke hits them on the shoulder and

knocks him out knocks my boots boots sir

lets us still waking up yeah so three

claw attacks and ones bite attack with

advantage holy [ __ ] I'm gonna help you

out

roll them one at a time roll one of the

time yeah I have to want one at a time

because they have advantage so the first

one class 21 first one misses second one

17 plus 6 is 23 I'm done okay you're

down that one hit point he looks like 5

10 15 20 25

he's only got 5 more feet bill actually

how much movement does it yet

it's even awake hey you do his thing is

leach even awake yeah he was meditating

yeah he can he can even wake up so he

wants to run him otherwise we keep

meditating wait wait we're all dying yes

leach always run somebody regret for

subsection C says unleashes turn oh man

I read it I don't think I put his like

surgeon ability on there though did you

not

when does leave is yeah he's after one

initiative and he's gonna go after these

are done it's a reaction yeah it's like

a reaction you could teleport next to

them that thing didn't use all of its of

facts so he might just like going over

there to get them up only fall down

again yeah see my exactly just down

there might be on the wiki yeah yeah I

think it's a he just like he basically

just [ __ ] like runs over there and then

yeah rock is diving king of the mods

king of Moskva has a reaction when King

goes down leech can move up to his speed

and and then spend their hit died as a

free action though oh he spends your hit

die for you yep yeah it's a reason to

hit die is it like that how whatever

that hit die is plus your constitution

modified so yeah that other so there's

the one so that one moved and attacked

the other one used its earthquake

ability which caused all this damage to

happen and then there's one on judge

hello Josh well he was on me the user

ground he Underground's after after big

cat slapped him around Underground's he

emerges or just me over ground a super

grounds Manticore fats on minutes [ __ ]

it's the only thing that's the only

thing about tonight that I'm not happy

about otherwise things are going

splendidly please see AC 18 sits so

that's one o'clock and I miss on the

bite and the claw is six points now he

takes this poison from a claw

uh-huh at the end of his turn at the end

of his turn he goes and sings my my

reaction for hellish rebuke am I able to

do that before he goes below ground yes

yay rebuke him cute I feel like it's

taken alas taken a lot including iron

golems and cooperation from copper but I

think you guys are actually close to a

tipping point 'm of people too many

people going unconscious too quickly

this warning counter could actually turn

out to be depending on who attacks women

how much damage you guys do this dirty

saving throw decks already saving

through his deck says +0 great and I

roll the milettis not good enough he's

going to take 9+10 he's gonna take 19

fire damage is this number 2 or 3 319

fire damage Wow got it that one and all

of these orner done now leach can go go

ahead and make number 2 number 1 number

1 make a DC 14 con save o our old a 4

plus 6 is 10 they are certainly Conville

10 i'm not rule can I have three more da

yeah sure once it can't read the rocks

yeah then the Freddy rocks they're

really pretty I mean they're really

pretty

yeah yeah right that's nice so let's see

what if I get some gold foil 20 turn

there damage from white whoa his head

and he says it kills it which one was

this that was number 130

thirteen chronic the sweet draw warlock

touches your head to make sure your

ticket that's pretty cool yeah so you

see leeches I is filled with power as it

drains the life of this creature

unfortunately it has it is even more

peaceful than leeches abilities

weasel yeah pissed off no powerful

what's what doesn't do anything don't

you see

you see it's it's rocky Hyde start to

crumble and parts of it turn to dust and

flake off but flake off mother flaker

but it doesn't it's not dead it's

unhappy

I think I'm this leech never does that

much damage you never cast his spells he

literally never cast he tried and the

battle against black iron pact he was

gonna walk up to somebody and cast

blight on them and he and that was I

believe wasted that was the counterspell

the counterspell the counterspell then

he tried to kind of as well that was him

trying to use blight in to his credit

telling him to use his spells uh so is

it Kings turn no yes

attack attack me commander attack what

does King say attack he looks at him

yells yeah

trailing rekt hey Jason you still here

I'm role played for me coward coward

Jesus say SiC em SiC sorry dude

and I search site tonight yeah I know I

rolled a two well these guys have crazy

high you see my world of four yeah well

that's even if they didn't have crazy

okay that was king of judge I assume

that since you guys were just

complaining of how ineffective your

business why what's wrong with buzz

she won't so here are these back sucks

I'm gonna heal myself that was Nate

okay that was king it's judge oh god

that was this friend of me is completely

submerged again right well no he's not

completely submerged you could just see

his like little eyeballs sticking out

his little mouth tossing grenade in his

mouth step one

invent grenade long time so I miss could

have returned again I know exactly what

I'm gonna do is that the second spell so

go ahead and use my it broke long do it

and reach down to boots and get the [ __ ]

up are you gonna in frontal conduit from

me into oh you're not gonna are you high

enough level to transfer between two

people I'm not doing that

I'm just curious oh no not yet okay soon

I think ninth level is when you can you

can transfer the true conduit okay so

yeah and just use one d8 I think it is

former I guess I gave you used to but it

does damage to judge yes it eats judges

appoints its own no I see it is it's a

place you're my favorite 16 so I

transfer 16 of my HPD you aren't you

special what's gosh ever since ever

since Asmodeus brought you back to the

dead it seems like this judges favorite

warm familiar feeling like I want to

really see this blazing sigil and robed

in flames and then I huh your works not

done gain consciousness the master has

need of you yet yeah I've seen you take

you took the evil weapon you've got that

vampire thing boots it's like we don't

even know you anymore

that was judge it's boots

mr. fancy boots let's see let's see

dancer do something cool man yeah now

are you gonna attack the one that's

incredibly hard to hit yes okay was that

a loaded question um use my bonus

actually because I saw us actually due

to cast hex on the hidden guy cool yeah

so he's now doesn't is that automatic

mmm-hmm okay it says you place a curse

on a creature that you can see within

range until the spell and do deal an

extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target

whenever you hit it with an attack I

need to choose an ability the target has

disadvantaged own ability checks me with

a chosen ability ability that's yeah my

god it's not saved

no it's skill Chuck's basically so I

think the grappling with rabble strength

yes keep mine the hex is on stuff you do

hex does when you yeah yeah yeah so yeah

you want to you want to pick an ability

your other abilities take advantage of

I'm not gonna use like an ability

against him though no but like a yeah

that's true it cuz it doesn't work on

saving it doesn't affect saving throws

but I always think tax rolls ability

checks and saving throws are the three

different roles

I was thinking strength though because

if I do attack with my weapon and he

tries to eat me exactly how it works

yeah okay he's hexed makes sense

alright I'm actually so since he's he's

in the ground except for his little

eyeballs and his head right alright I'm

gonna sweep around here cuz this was the

one who bit my foot yeah so yeah we're

about to dance dance pissed dude said a

shitty day to hit you had your first

attacker so alright yeah this is number

two I believe walls right

so that is 11 damage from the first tech

second attack is a crit nice a plus B

plus so 16 damage from the second attack

16 is 4 less than 20 more which is and I

hit with two attacks I'm saying yeah the

sound answer works

poke them in each of his stupid eyes you

happy with the design of dancer because

it's a nice magic item but it's not

overpowering I feel as though if you hit

with the first two you get a third one

as long as you're talking the same

person yeah

so you see boots does but you see them

do this before the rapier attack twice

and then there's this moment with the

after the second attack where he like

literally pirouettes and stabs again but

you haven't seen him do unfortunately

he's a little off-balance we don't

usually do that meteoric iron almost

attire yeah that makes sense

impressive very cool football that was

boots it's alright so thanks to that

shockwave ivory ferocity that's right

[Laughter]

yeah big cat [ __ ] his tentacles yeah

I'm gonna take this one I have advantage

blimey don't don't don't Google that how

does he have a 16 charisma but he has to

16 as me because man who doesn't know

what the hell he's doing cuz I wonder if

this whole time his spell said this is

15 well yeah Dean D the reason he likes

using do Jeon

because it means he doesn't need to know

how to play D&D his decease right though

because I have a +4 in mine 15 and he

has a plus 8 oh yeah but we're both

school pastors were both profession hang

on uh what are you looking at there

Wisconsin that's that's not his modifier

that's uh that's his same drum his

ability score increases from like like I

don't know it's very confusing what are

you doing 16 plus 2 pinnacle when you

see this what do you see is a UI

designer not you a signer is what it is

I know what it is because I made it

typical typical designer response matter

discos in chat here says I know what

they do use blame here cuz he's a wanker

such a bellend yes we're gonna play for

another two hours just to spite him okay

so I did my tentacle tentacle Glock a K

whatever 41 damage okay but these aren't

magic attacks yeah I know

yes yes a big cat kills that sort okay

that shreds it and you see that it

actually splits into three pieces

yeah it kind of sort of been it's good

some guts all spill out it's a crickets

got organs and stuff it's just yeah so

that was one dead zone on the ground all

right good job because

thank you oh I'd only get one that was

big that let me finish up my uh yeah

yeah you know we just clean up the rest

of him real quick go to sleep

no it's not that one's in the round

seventeen plus eleven hits for seven

damage you can roll that one oh goes to

right no so to you oh yeah eight damage

it just becomes eight Damian yeah and

this is number one knows number two a

damage and what's that from a magic

polka although Bombo 15 missus

okay that was copper and big-headed slim

okay so where am I um I guess I'll move

to the other side of of Judge over here

no no no like oh yeah yeah so detective

yeah I want to get advantage on that

[ __ ] yeah I'm gonna hit him mmm

there's no bachelor spirit in the ground

right there's no place for me to get

advantage on that guy yeah 25 it's it's

yes try something I'm going to use my

menacing attack cool I want to see if

these guys will come run be afraid

[Music]

[Music]

twenty-four damage this is number three

correct yes it is yeah and what does the

man singh attack do okay so he lets see

your where's it at he needs to make a

wisdom saving through bead adhesive DC

15 otherwise he is frightened until the

end of my next turn

yeah so you see after your furious

assault the fact that you hit it while

it was cowering underground and you see

its eye is kind of go you'll find out

what it does on it sir okay alright well

I guess I will attack it again does

attacking it again in any way affect the

frightening this I don't believe she

doesn't say it but yeah let's see here

and we use a precision strike by the way

while we're on break our buddy Jerry was

nice enough to get cake and cake and

cupcakes and Porto's potato balls or for

birthday celebrations thank you very

much Jerry Jerry's 23 23 0.32 23 ac 19

damage for that one nineteen damages

this is one less than 28 so yeah it's

it's huge big you see slim is stabbing

down into its buried form and big chunks

of rock are flying out and that's slim

that's my turn yep the Zorn go and let's

see this Zorn

from its buried position you

I'll have to make dexterity checks is it

so frightened oh no that's right I'm

sorry the one that slim attacked goes

and disappears into the ground and you

hear this kind of then the other spit on

the ground yeah I think that one it has

already done everything right yeah I

remember correctly so he is just going

to attack normally and one two three he

attacks mr. fancy boots four five six

the attacks chicken a la king

one two three fancy boots no normal

three claws how many levels we're not

doing the economy that's why 10 X 16 17

and the fight probably hits 14 plus 6 is

20 Bad News Bears

that is 13 points of damage cop you

think I learned to avoid this so early

number 3 has fled and will not be

appearing in this battle yes just number

2 is left and it's leech oh yeah number

number that one goes everywhere and

berries in the ground till it's justice

eyeballs so his AC is now 21 will make a

[ __ ] concert I will make it that's

fine a lot damage I rolled a 16 plus 6

is 20 so I'm gonna rock ones first

alright math laughs not easy for intense

that's a 10

that's a pen

thanks

it made it so 29 haft is

14 I think it's been what oh you wait

definitely sure Lucius turn he has to

blitz his defeat we're warlocks yeah yep

he drains the life of it until it looks

legit was just this withered husk the

kind of half flops out of the hole you

can see two of its arms out of the stone

its eyes roll up in the back of its head

and it expires and it goes from being

this ruddy rust colored red to being

gray stone Welsh Italy so those things

don't leave a hole behind them know they

like number holes stab differ there are

different movements

yeah I'm relieved holes behind them is

orange or not does one move through

stone like you guys move through here

like graboids

they're like redwoods obviously alright

guys I mean maybe we should back up to

the butcher shop

it's not that far really is it yes I

mentioned that earlier

coming from a slab where you have one

I'm wondering how's that chance what's

the worst that could happen

yeah there's no way tell we didn't even

get to roll so it was kind of garbage so

yeah

I mean we're not talking miles we're

talking feet yeah you know it's just up

the way

I'm gonna walk over I'm gonna pick up my

my little bag and I'm just gonna like

throw it over my shoulder and then just

like and just like toss myself on two

big cats back instantly fall asleep big

cat puts as his two big tentacle pads

yeah yeah sure whatever

no sleep he's a big cat so he that was

the whole point

ah no no we have gone up the ladder so

you're fine yeah okay well we rest we

rest in the soon-to-be sausage shop oh

do you yeah

and all of our dudes are there yeah

that's right because we told angel in

them to show up mariya for the opening

day as you folks are marching through

the twisting rough hewn caverns dug by

other creatures and you're approaching

the the stairway it's actually like cut

into the stone that will lead up into

the sausage shop you see two figures

standing guard one of them you recognize

both of them they're both a junior

officers one of them is a mate

what are the where's these it's got like

a pipe anywhere is these glass a nice

tip and you remember soot and there's

also another junior officer who's kinda

looks actually like a younger age axe

it's got blond hair he's fair-skinned

he's got a scar like a Dueling scar and

you know this to be frost wince and as

you guys are approaching suit has this

long smoking pipe that he has and he

takes any rose frost says sorry serves

strict orders from angel no senior

officers through the main exit you have

to follow us okay what I mean exit why

is that angel said keep up appearances

keep your answers wait don't don't we go

through the basement wasn't this place

there's another way up sirs okay another

way yeah okay all right where's the

where's the other way out or there's

another way up into the shop there's a

store next to the shop that there's a

alleyway next to it would be more

obvious just follow us okay okay

mmm-hmm and he takes you up through a we

don't me on the metal ladder there's

another one of those yeah you guys

haven't seen yeah it goes up into

according Lord Raquel mass has just

gifted another 200 subs oh my gosh

so that's doesn't have a sub that's one

of the reasons I think we see some of

the growth that we see in our viewership

is that random twitch users at this

point who are watching other channels go

what and so they go what is this and

they come and they watch and they're

like huh

yeah frost leads you through up into

another there's a store next to the

sausage shop it looks like it used to be

a candle makers store and it's also

abandoned and it's it's dark in here the

windows are dirty

there's nothing unlike the sausage shop

which was boarded up there's nothing

blocking the windows other than grime

and there's a door and he holds up his

hand and he opens the door and he looks

out and he goes we can go it this way

and it's an alley and as you exit and

walk out like around the into the street

that the sausage shop and the cow shop

front onto you can see that the sausage

shop it looks like it's a going concern

there are like regular people in there

people you don't recognize did we get

well I wouldn't know this because I'm

asleep but did we get the sausage cart

guy from this dais who's who's a

retainer is angel that was sweets no

well it's up to you guys who runs angel

who tells angel who tells angel what to

do maybe that's the better way putting

up who's in charge of telling angel with

dad you okay yeah that's fine I see I

mean no go forth make a make a make a

detour a check what would you type is

the track that I can't answer no no it's

an 8 or just right nope you don't know

if or sausage vendor is wasn't an angel

is not able to make him an offer

a lot of how much money he's gonna make

one prefers he prefers to be a business

for himself you know he's making a good

making good living take orders from

somebody else we can make we can make

kayo sausages so thank you Kilis that's

a ridiculous number of subs hope you're

being I hope you're being responsible

but thank you

well I think we should probably just

rest in this other house right it's also

chop I think has upstairs there's a

dancing minstrel is where angel is

waiting oh the in actual end if you sirs

are welcome to rest wherever

I'll just go ladies will know where you

are but angel angel had strict orders

that no no members of the chaîne no

senior officers and no junior officers a

regular soldier no senior officers in

their livery well I mean I don't want to

get pulled into other stuff here we got

downstairs so I'd rather sleep near the

entrance and if angel wants to come talk

to us great but we gotta go actually go

back to sleep look I wouldn't want to

actually come out I'd want to get up

there to the house sleep so people don't

know where we are they can go get angel

and he can come see us sneakily but so

yeah frost looks at it and says so and

so goes yeah there's a suit we'll stay

with you folks I'll go talk to Angel and

then he stops and he's like butts and

but looks to judge in the commander I

stay with you or do want me to go back

of it not figure sorry sorry I think a

frost is like buy any marshes off to go

deliver a report to Angel regarding well

actually he wants to know what has

happened that like frost wants to know

what should I tell angel I just tell

angel come talk to us we'll update you

when you get back here we don't want

this information going out where's the

dragon is the green dragon with us

that's right yeah she's gonna leave now

what that's why I didn't want to come up

here Anna why'd you say that see that

so chill actually it's who's gonna help

us take care of that lady yeah but she

needs to go talk to the it's right now I

think it's probably more important to

her

considering how [ __ ] lethal it is

down there that the church knows what's

going on because it doesn't do it

doesn't do her or the church any good to

keep an eye on that lady behind the

prison if she dies if this if the dragon

were nice it's a lady or Rosa var you

can't leave well that's between you and

your God but I have to go report to the

church no you you can't leave yet I'm

not a member of the chain I don't take

orders from you it's gonna be a really

big [ __ ] problem well it seems like

there's a problem no matter what I do

know just look let's finish the mission

you're free to finish whatever mission

you're on I am gonna finish manage me

what secret are you trying to keep

hidden we don't want anyone to know that

what this is down here do we don't know

for a moment pretty fact I regretted not

trusting you but I was right not to

trust you wasn't I

what's there not to trust I want this

information get am I am i leaving if

people know that this is gonna have the

handle of the door to the candle shop

stop her when you pick this up next week

this uh
