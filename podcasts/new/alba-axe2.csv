Hi everyone! It’s Eli here, your writer and sound designer, back with long-awaited season 2 of The Axe & Crown.
We’ve got six shiny new episodes, one dropping every other week for you. Plus we’ve got a whole bunch of bonus episodes too. If you’re a and up supporter on Patreon you’ll get to hear those too.
For the first time, we are recording this thing at home, here on our attic studio where we also record The End of Time and Other Bothers, as well as our sci fi show Civilized. That makes it easier to record, and that means it’s going to be less of a wait between seasons, so that’s awesome. The only drawback is, there’s no control room so Sean and I have to keep quiet and not laugh all the way through the takes, because our cast are wonderful. Thanks to them. Thanks to our supporting producers, Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona. And thanks to all our supporters on Patreon. We are so grateful and so excited to be bringing this new season to you. We hope you enjoy it.

ANNOUNCER
The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 1: A Taste of Something New.
MORNING
The bar is empty, but a big crowd is milling around outside. Stan is watching them out the window.
GUBBIN
(hums to himself)
Hey, Stan! How you doing?
STAN
(distracted)
Huh? Oh, morning Gubbin.
A moment passes.
GUBBIN
Stan.
STAN
Yeah.
GUBBIN
Stan, no.
STAN
What?
GUBBIN
Whatever it is, we’re not doing it.
STAN
What are we doing?
GUBBIN
You’re staring out the window at the Badger and Bucket.
STAN
Well, yeah, look, it’s across the street. If I look out the window, there’s not much else to see.
GUBBIN
Uh huh. But that always means they’re doing some stupid trendy new thing that you’re gonna want us to do too.
STAN
Yeah, probably. I mean, that’s what they do, they beat us to every cool new idea.
GUBBIN
Okay. What is it? Fondue? Peanut butter tacos? 24-karat gold pie for a limited time only?
STAN
It’s… brunch.
GUBBIN
Huh?
STAN
It’s a cross between breakfast and—
GUBBIN
Yeah, the word is familiar to me. Are all those people actually lining up to get in?
STAN
I mean, I guess.
GUBBIN
You guess, Stan? What’s the matter with you?
STAN
I dunno. It’s like you said, I’m always trying some stupid new thing here and it never works out.
GUBBIN
Yeah, but it livens up the place.
STAN
I just feel like maybe I should do something else, and leave this place to you and Betula to run. You’ve been here forever. You know what works.
GUBBIN
I know what used to work. Business is changing around here. We’re sure not packing in patrons on a Saturday morning like we used to be. Look at all those people.
STAN
Yeah, look at them. They’re really our crowd. All those hoity toity downtown hipster types.
GUBBIN
Like you’re not one of them! Come on.
STAN
Hanging out on the patio, eating their delicious-looking food.
GUBBIN
Yeah. Just imagine all those hoity toity downtown folks coming here instead, with all their hoity toity cash and showering me in it. Heh heh. That’s a good dream.
The door opens.
GUBBIN
Say, that could be one now!
BETULA
Hey Stan. Hey Uncle.
GUBBIN
Or not.
STAN
Hey Betula.
BETULA
What’s going on across the street? I’ve never seen it so packed.
STAN
They’re serving brunch. It’s the new big thing, apparently.
BETULA
Wow. Why aren’t we getting in on that action?
GUBBIN
Good question. What do you think, Stan? This is your specialty.
STAN
What is my specialty?
GUBBIN
You’re all about this kinda trendy bullcrap anyway—um, I mean, opportunity. You’re our… let’s call it Head of Innovation.
STAN
I am?
BETULA
Yeah, you’re the one always trying out new ideas around here.
GUBBIN
If it wasn’t for you, Stan, this place would just be a dusty, forgotten little hole in the wall. Like it used to be.
STAN
Aw, thanks, guys.
I guess we could try serving brunch. We’re not gonna get that many people to fit in here, though. That’s the problem.
GUBBIN
Course not. Brunch at the Axe and Crown will have to be a smaller affair. More intimate.
BETULA
Yeah! More laid-back.
STAN
Yeah, more cozy. We should have candles.
BETULA
Maybe put up some work by local artists.
STAN
Oh! That sounds so nice. How about a special craft beer? A breakfast beer!
GUBBIN
Yeah! Yeah, see? That’s the Stan I know.
STAN
Something with some real Axe and Crown flair. We could have pancakes shaped like little shields and things.
GUBBIN
(with difficulty)
Yeah. Sure.
STAN
Betula, you could make kling klangs!
BETULA
Ooo. Or bone waffles. No! Seagull on toast.
STAN
Oh yeah! I can see it now—sorry, did you say seagull?
GUBBIN
Maybe Betula can hook us up with some of that unicorn coffee.
STAN
Oh, unicorn coffee, wow! Where the unicorns, like, eat the berries and daintily spit out the beans?
GUBBIN
Yeah, that’s how it’s made.
STAN
Have you had that stuff? It is delicious. But how are we gonna get a hold of some?
BETULA
I may have had a little something to do with bringing unicorn coffee to Grandville originally.
STAN
Wait, what?! Why aren’t we serving it right now?
Silence.
BETULA
Oh, Stan.
STAN
What?
GUBBIN
(starts chuckling)
STAN
What? What’d I miss?
BETULA
See… a couple months ago, this buddy of mine was due to get a coffee shipment in from Niamondu, but the caravan arrived two days early, in a total panic. Somehow the horses had gotten into the bags and they ate everything.
STAN
Oh no!
BETULA
Yeah. They did a three-day trip in one night. But all the coffee beans were gone. All he had were four really grumpy, really twitchy horses and a giant pile of poop.
STAN
Oh man, wow!
Wait, what does this have to do with unicorns?
BETULA
I’m getting there. Anyway, the poor guy was in tears. So I had to help him out. I took the, you know, shipment off his hands, added a little fake vanilla flavouring, and got some friends to come by and package it up. Sold most of it to different Bucket pubs.
STAN
I know! They were serving it right across the street. But wait, if the horses ate everything…
GUBBIN
(goes on laughing)
STAN
Then how… there wouldn’t have been… no. No, no, no.
That means that the coffee was…
BETULA
Wait. Did you go there and drink some?
STAN
Well, of course I did! It’s unicorn coffee!
BETULA
(groans)
GUBBIN
(cackles)
STAN
Think about it! When you hear the name “Unicorn Coffee”, are you gonna pass that by? I had to try that. It tasted really good!
BETULA
Oh no, Stan, I’m sorry.
STAN
Oh man.
BETULA
I mean, at least they boil the water there when they make coffee.
GUBBIN
(laughs harder)
STAN
Wait. Did Dorothea know it was… not really from unicorns?
GUBBIN
Yeah! And that the horses weren’t spitting out those beans?
STAN
(groans)
BETULA
She probably figured it out. I don’t think she cared either way.
STAN
What? Really?
BETULA
Nah. For her, it was just the latest hot new food trend.
GUBBIN
Yeah, they always gotta have some weird new thing on the menu.
STAN
Yeah, well, you know what? We’ll show them. As Head of…
GUBBIN
Innovation.
STAN
Thank you. Innovation—I say we’re gonna give that crowd a taste of new sensations like they have never seen!
GUBBIN
That’s it, team!
Music sting.
NEXT SATURDAY AFTERNOON
The last of the brunch crowd filters out, leaving the bar empty.
STAN
Bye guys! Thanks for coming! Tell your friends! Axe and Crown… brunchy brunch.
He shuts the door behind them, and drops the cheery façade.
STAN
(sighs)
Oh, man.
GUBBIN
You all right there, kid?
STAN
Yeah, I’m fine.
GUBBIN
What’s the matter? Brunch was a big hit.
STAN
I guess it was.
GUBBIN
You guess?
Betula emerges from the kitchen.
BETULA
Well? How did we do?
GUBBIN
(still talking to Stan)
Kid, we must have made eighty crowns!
BETULA
Wow! That’s almost worth getting up early with a Saturday morning hangover.
GUBBIN
Yeah. And that’s eighty crowns after the decorations and Stan’s cask of crap beer.
STAN
Craft beer.
GUBBIN
Craft.
STAN
Craft. Say it with me.
GUBBIN
Craaaaft. Craft beer. Geez, I keep getting that wrong.
STAN
I know.
BETULA
Hey, what’s going on? What’s up, Stan?
STAN
Me? Oh, nothing. No, listen. I’m glad it went well.
BETULA
This was your idea! Your first big idea as Head of Innovation. And it went great! Especially for the first time doing it.
GUBBIN
Yeah! You sure told us.
See, this is where you’re supposed to rub it in our faces and dance around like an annoying little twerp.
STAN
Look. There’s just something missing here, you know? I don’t know what it is. I can’t put my finger on it.
BETULA
They got a patio.
GUBBIN
And about ten more tables than us.
STAN
Yeah, but it’s more than that. Something special.
GUBBIN
Signature cocktails?
BETULA
We had crabgrass smoothies. And our famous Mud Street Marmalade.
GUBBIN
Okay, you gotta tell me. Is there some kinda gristle in that for the special ingredient?
BETULA
Nope, my lips are sealed.
STAN
Wait! I know what it was! Live music.
GUBBIN
In the marmalade?
STAN
No, no, across the street. They had that awesome fiddle player.
GUBBIN
Yeah, roaming the patio and bugging everyone at their tables.
STAN
Everyone was super into it! They were all laughing and clapping along, and that little girl was passing around the hat collecting coins—she was so cute. I guess she’s his daughter or something?
BETULA
Granddaughter.
STAN
Oh! Do you know him?
BETULA
Yeah, Cinnamon Ted! He really knows how to work a crowd.
GUBBIN
Heh heh.
STAN
If you know him, why is he playing across the street? Why can’t we get him in here?
BETULA
Well…
GUBBIN
Well, let’s see. Given the choice between playing this charming but tiny little bar and the whole Badger and Bucket with its expensive patio, which would you choose?
STAN
I guess that makes sense.
There’s a complicated knock at the back door.
STAN
What’s that?
GUBBIN
Oh. Sounds like one of yours, Betula.
BETULA
Yeah, I’ll get that. One sec.
She heads off to answer the door.
STAN
One of her what?
GUBBIN
Nothing, nothing.
Betula opens the back door.
BETULA
(from the back hallway)
Hey Ted. Hey Jessie.
TED
(from the back hallway)
Well hey there, Miss Betula!
STAN
Hey, I think that’s the guy!
GUBBIN
(feigning ignorance)
What guy?
Stan is halfway across the room.
STAN
The fiddler guy! Aw, I gotta go say hello.
GUBBIN
Wait, wait. Stan. I got an idea!
STAN
Hold that thought. I’ll be right back.
GUBBIN
A brunch idea, Stan! This one’s really good!
STAN
I’ll be right back.
GUBBIN
It’s gold! It’s got mocha!
STAN
Hold on!
GUBBIN
Doh! Dammit.
We follow Stan to the back door.
BETULA
(hushed)
Oh yeah, this is a great bracelet, but it’s a little too unique, you know? It might have to leave town if it’s gonna sell—
STAN
Hey guys!
BETULA
(startled, guilty)
Stan!
STAN
Are you Cinnamon Ted, by chance?
TED
Why yes, I’m Ted and this is Jessie.
STAN
It is so good to meet you. I’m Stan.
BETULA
Yeah, this is Stan, our fine and law-abiding landlord.
TED
A pleasure, my friend.
STAN
I just wanted to say how great you were.
TED
Oh! Well, thank you very much.
STAN
Listen. We were really groovin’ over here across the street listening to you.
TED
Too kind, too kind.
STAN
Hey, your granddad’s pretty talented, isn’t he? Eh, Jessie? Hi! Hi there Jessie! Hello!
Silence.
TED
She doesn’t talk much.
STAN
That’s okay! My name is Stan. How do you do, Jessie?
BETULA
You don’t have to shake hands if you don’t want to, Jessie.
STAN
Up to you. Hey, there ya go!
BETULA
Oh boy.
STAN
That’s an excellent handshake. High five! Down low—too slow! Heh heh! That was pretty funny, wasn’t it, Jessie? No. Not funny. Wow, tough room.
BETULA
Well then, if that’s everything, Stan…
STAN
Yeah, hey, listen. I just wanted to say, just while I have you here, that was a great job, Ted. I wish that we could get someone like you for our weekend brunch.
TED
Oh! Well, I’m afraid my weekends are booked up for the next little while.
STAN
Whatever Dorothea is paying you, I’ll double it!
TED
Oh, she’s not paying me. It’s all passing the hat, plus a pinch of petty pilfer…
BETULA
(clears her throat)
TED
…I mean, a pinch of passing the hat some more. Surprisingly lucrative.
STAN
I’ll make up the difference.
TED
I hate to say it, but that’s gonna be a pretty big difference.
STAN
I don’t care.
TED
Especially if we’re, you know…
(he catches another look from Betula)
Doing things above board.
STAN
Above board? I don’t—
(dawning realization)
Oh. Oh my gosh.
BETULA
There it is.
STAN
Are you telling me that all the while you’re busking at these places, you’re… you are not declaring your income?
TED
Yeah. Heh. Yeah, exactly. Promise you won’t tell?
STAN
Oh, well, sure. Yeah, that’s cool. Cool cool cool cool. Listen, I’m down with you. I know. It’s hard making a living as an artist.
TED
That it is. So glad you understand.
STAN
Oh, a hundred percent. So… what would it take to convince you to play at the Axe and Crown?
BETULA
Uh, Stan, can we talk about this later?
STAN
Oh, sorry, sorry! I totally barged in. That is my fault. You guys were talking about—hey, that’s a nice bracelet.
TED
Yeah. This belonged to my mother. I was just asking Betula what I might be able to get for it.
STAN
Wait. Isn’t that a Louisa Shilman piece? That knotwork is totally Shilman.
TED
It is? Gosh.
BETULA
Wow.
TED
I had no idea.
STAN
This thing is probably worth a thousand crowns!
TED
Whoa!
BETULA
Really!
STAN
I know just the place to take it. You won’t get a better price for it anywhere. I guarantee it!
TED
Really? That’s… that’s awfully nice of you.
STAN
Oh yeah. Super honest folks. They do appraisals and everything, they’ll register it and make sure it’s not stolen…
TED
Okay! I’ll have think about it.
STAN
Would that perhaps be worth maybe a show or two for brunch?
TED
I’m not completely sure I want to part with this just yet.
BETULA
Oh, yeah, a family heirloom like that, I get it.
STAN
Oh, I get it too, completely. If you change your mind, just come and find me.
TED
Will do.
BETULA
Yeah, for sure. No need to sell it today.
STAN
Are you okay, Betula?
BETULA
Why? Pffft. I’m fine. You! You’re—what?
STAN
Are you sure you’re fine?
BETULA
(scoffs)
Yes.
STAN
Ted? Did this bracelet really belong to your mother?
TED
Yeah! Course it did!
STAN
‘Cause I’m getting the feeling, and I’m just spit-balling here, that this belonged to somebody else until recently, and found its way into your possession through unknown means. Am I wrong in that assumption?
BETULA
Oh boy.
TED
I swear, my old Ma got it as a wedding present…
STAN
No, no, no, no, it’s all good, it’s all good. Cool, cool, I’m down. I’m down with that. I’m all about supporting the regular people. That’s the way it works, I’m just putting one over on all those rich snobs, yeah. Share the wealth, just get it around there. That’s what I’m—
BETULA
Yeah. Stealing.
STAN
Yes. Stealing. That’s—yes. Betula, I wasn’t gonna say it out loud, not in front of the girl—where’d she go?
Whoa! Hey, sorry. Almost stepped on you. Sorry, Jessie!
BETULA
It’s fine, Stan.
STAN
Jessie, do you want a lollipop?
(silence)
Jessie, do you want glass of lemonade?
Jessie, do you want to go in and see Gubbin? So us grownups can go on discussing this extremely boring topic?
BETULA
Actually, Ted, why don’t you two head out, and I’ll catch up to you at the hmm-hmmm-hmm.
TED
Gotcha. What time?
Betula makes a subtle hand gesture.
TED
Okay. See you then! Nice meeting you, Stan.
STAN
Oh, hey, nice meeting you too…
(whispers)
What just happened?
BETULA
Never mind.
TED
Jessie? Do you want to give the nice man back his wallet?
Stan pats his pockets frantically.
STAN
My—Jessie! You thieving little…!
(he snatches the wallet)
I mean, thank you, Jessie, that was a good thing you did, giving it back.
TED
Farewell, my friends!
BETULA
Bye, guys.
Jessie and Ted slip out into the alleyway. The door shuts.
STAN
How did she do that?!
BETULA
She’s good.
STAN
When did she take my wallet, though? Was it when we shook hands?
BETULA
It was while you were high-fiving her.
STAN
Oh, damn. That’s impressive.
Hey, that little hand-wavy thing you and Ted did? Was that like, code?
BETULA
The less you know, the better, Stan.
She heads back to the bar. Stan follows.
STAN
Aw, but… no, Betula! I’m cool with it. I’m cool cool. Everything’s cool cool.
GUBBIN
Oh, he’s cool now. Huh.
Well, how’d that go?
BETULA
He knows.
GUBBIN
I tried.
BETULA
Sure.
STAN
Wait. Hold on. Pause. You two do this a lot? Why didn’t you tell me you had like, a super secret thieving operation?
BETULA
There’s no “operation”.
STAN
How does the sign language work? Do you guys like, hold up three fingers for “Look out for guards”? Or waggle your eyebrows for “Meet me behind the lodge at midnight”?
BETULA
Stan. You know I can’t tell you.
STAN
You can tell me! I can keep a secret! I’m so good at keeping secrets! Secrets are the—
I totally can’t keep a secret.
BETULA
I know you’re curious, but… remember the last time, with that lady who was a were-cow.
STAN
Yeah, it kinda slipped out. But at least no one got trampled that badly…
Look, you know me. I just wanna be a part of whatever it is you’re doing! Because you guys, I think of you like family, you know? You’re always good to me, and I want to help.
GUBBIN
(sighs)
There is one big thing you can do.
STAN
Yeah? Yeah? What?
GUBBIN
Run a good, honest tavern.
BETULA
Exactly. Make this place look legit.
GUBBIN
Like we’re just keeping up with the Badger and Bucket and everybody else in town.
STAN
Okay!
GUBBIN
And that will really help Betula with her “business dealings”.
BETULA
Oh, my “business dealings”? What about your “business dealings”?
STAN
You have business dealings too?
GUBBIN
I just pour the beer.
BETULA
(scoffs)
Yeah, you pour the beer.
GUBBIN
That’s all, just a little bit here, a little bit there… heh heh.
So, Stan? What do you say?
STAN
Yeah! Run a tavern? I can do that.
BETULA
Thanks, Stan. I appreciate it.
STAN
Whatever you need, I gotcha.
GUBBIN
Good.
STAN
First order of business: brunch planning for next weekend!
BETULA
Perfect. I have one seagull left.
STAN
There’s a little cafe downtown—no, skip the seagull—they serve toast with this weird new kind of squishy green fruit and sea salt on top. Mmmm. So good.
GUBBIN
All right, all right. Serve whatever the hell you want, just leave me out of it.
STAN
Oooh, and I want one of those cool little griddle things for making crêpes…
GUBBIN
I am gonna go find a horse and see if it will kick me in the head.
STAN
You do that. I am gonna get down to business, because we are gonna take down the Badger and Bucket once and for all.

And then after that, we’re going to start giving everyone an Alba sticker a special sticker we’ve got printed, and then after the 10 people, if we get to that 11th person, everyone is going to get an Axe & Crown coaster.
We’re super excited about that. Your support allows us to keep creating the show, and there’s all kinds of other perks you get.

ANNOUNCER
The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 2: The Cutting Edge.
INT. BAR—MONDAY MORNING
Stan enters from the street, struggling to carry something big and wooden.
GUBBIN
What the hell are you doing?
STAN
Morning, guys!
BETULA
Hey, Stan.
GUBBIN
Why do you have a giant board?
STAN
It’s a blackboard. See?
BETULA
Stan!
GUBBIN
No!
Too late. Stan turns the board around and knocks over a table. A tankard goes flying.
STAN
Whoops!
GUBBIN
Kid—
STAN
Sorry about that, guys! I’m just gonna install it in the back room.
GUBBIN
Why? What, are we teaching school now? No! Where the hell are you gonna put it?
STAN
Just on the far wall beside the windows.
GUBBIN
And cover the dartboard?
STAN
No, no, no! It’s for our new meeting space-slash-studio, see?
GUBBIN
Oh boy, this sounds like a winner.
BETULA
Wait, the back room already is a meeting space.
STAN
Yeah, but now it’ll have better tables to work at, nice chairs, natural lighting…
BETULA
Natural—
She runs to the back room.
BETULA (CONT’D)
Dammit, Stan!
STAN
What? Isn’t it nicer with those boards down off the windows?
GUBBIN
You took the boards down?!
STAN
Yup!
GUBBIN
Kid…
STAN
What? You said you want me to run the tavern as best as I can.
GUBBIN
Sure. But not by doing stuff. Just clear it with us before you open the windows, or clean up a stain, or throw away a body part, or fix the floorboards—anything! Just clear it with us.
Betula returns.
BETULA
Stan, the whole point of having a back room is that no one can see in.
STAN
Yeah, but there’s no fresh air, and it’s so dreary during the day. Who wants to do work in a stuffy, pitch-black room?
BETULA
Me and my associates do. It’s kind of vital to certain, you know, discussions.
STAN
(conspiratorial)
Oh, hey, right, yeah, discussions. Uh huh. Gotcha.
BETULA
Can we just put the boards back up?
STAN
Hey, how about some big heavy curtains instead?
BETULA
Fine. Why do you need light back there, anyway? Who’s gonna be working there during the day?
STAN
Me and my associates!
GUBBIN
Your what?
STAN
Well, okay, just one associate so far. But we’re growing fast! See, me and my buddy Kalzak are starting a company.
GUBBIN
Kalzak? Kalzak the Disheveled?
STAN
That’s him! Doesn’t like that name, but yes.
BETULA
Who’s Kalzak?
GUBBIN
Remember that guy in the blue robe a couple nights ago? Kinda beat-up looking.
BETULA
Oh yeah, him. Always hides in the corner? Talks to himself a lot?
GUBBIN
That’s Kalzak.
STAN
Oh, he’s not talking to himself. He’s actually talking to his guardian spirit Ephos.
GUBBIN
Oh, so that kind of wizard. A demon-summoner.
BETULA
Well, that’s a relief.
STAN
Well, technically, Ephos isn’t a demon.
GUBBIN
Technically, I haven’t showered in three years.
STAN
That’s true. Anyway, Kal’s an old buddy of mine! He’s coming by this afternoon and we’re gonna talk business.
GUBBIN
Huh. What kind of business?
STAN
Magic services!
GUBBIN
(groans)
STAN
No, it’s the new big thing. You don’t have to know anything about magic, or spells, or summoning—
GUBBIN
Good, ’cause you don’t!
STAN
No, I don’t, but that’s the point! We do all the work, see? The trick is finding a niche. One little specialized service you can do easily, but that people will pay for!
BETULA
Huh. So what’s your “niche”?
STAN
Well, first off we were thinking of remote visiting.
BETULA
Like one of those mirrors that let you talk to somebody else?
STAN
Yeah! Yeah! Like that. But it turns out there’s a group at the University already working on a pocket version of that.
BETULA
So you could talk to other people pretty much any time, anywhere?
STAN
Exactly!
GUBBIN
Ugh. Makes me want to eat my own intestines.
BETULA
No, no, wait. That could be handy, actually.
STAN
Right? But then Kalzak and I came up with the killer idea. It’s gonna make us a million crowns.
GUBBIN
All right, let’s hear this.
STAN
All right. Ready?
GUBBIN
Yeah?
STAN
Food delivery.
Silence.
GUBBIN
That’s it?
STAN
Magical food delivery.
GUBBIN
(scoffs)
We’re not some five-star Mellurian restaurant. Anyway, if they want our food, they can come here their damn selves.
STAN
No, no, this is the genius part. We don’t just deliver our food. We deliver for every restaurant in the city, even your five-star Mellurian place—right to your home! By magic.
BETULA
Wait. Why do you need magic? What’s wrong with hiring some kid to deliver it for a few pennies?
STAN
Eh… I’m not really good at managing kids. They tend to be—
GUBBIN
Smarter than you?
STAN
Yeah. And I keep losing my wallet. But compare that to magic delivery! Arrives immediately, no fuss, no muss, no “oops, I dropped it in a puddle”. Just great food, straight from the kitchen! I’ll be right back.
Stan hurries into the back room.
GUBBIN
I think I smell the apocalypse.
BETULA
Oh come on, Uncle. Just for once, be supportive.
Stan brings out two boxes and sets them on the bar.
STAN
Check this out.
BETULA
What are these?
STAN
These two things are called Jessemer boxes. They’re linked with a displacement charm.
BETULA
They seem kinda small.
GUBBIN
Yeah, who’s our target market here? Rats?
STAN
Gubbin. It’s called a “proof of concept”. The real ones are gonna be bigger than this. But the concept is, we have a box, and the customer has a box. So if I put, let’s say this tankard in one, and… oh, that’s not gonna fit. Okay, let’s use peanuts. Here, these peanuts.
He cracks the shell on a peanut.
STAN
I put one in each box, close the door, push the button and—
A whoosh from inside the box. Stan opens the doors again.
STAN
See? The one with the shell off is over here now.
BETULA
So they swap whatever’s inside them?
STAN
Exactly! They switch contents. So the idea is, our customers just pick from a menu and we get notified of their order!
GUBBIN
Notified how?
STAN
Still working that part out. But when the meal’s ready, we put it in the box, the customer puts money in the box, we hit the button and boom! They get their food, we get paid!
GUBBIN
And what if they don’t put any money in? What if we get an empty box?
STAN
Ah, but see, there has to be something in each box. It’s the law of magical something something!
GUBBIN
They could put rocks in it.
STAN
Yeah, they totally could.
GUBBIN
That could satisfy the law of something something.
STAN
But then they would get reported, and we’d just cancel their subscription.
GUBBIN
And meanwhile we’re out the price of a meal.
STAN
No, no, no, see, we’ll charge a deposit on the box. If you cheat, you don’t get that money back. A ha ha ha!
GUBBIN
Eh, maybe.
STAN
You just don’t trust people, do you, Gub?
GUBBIN
Who got his wallet stolen by a five-year-old?
BETULA
Interesting… So this can transport anything?
STAN
Well… we still have to do a bit of testing.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DAY
Betula shouts from the kitchen.
BETULA
Food’s up!
STAN
Thanks Betula! C’mon, Gubbin. Check this out.
GUBBIN
Yeah, yeah. Let’s see.
STAN
Behold! The prototype delivery system for Meals By Magic!
GUBBIN
Okay.
STAN
Aren’t these boxes nice? I got in touch with this cabinet maker who used to do work for my dad—
GUBBIN
Yeah, yeah, let’s see it go.
STAN
Okay, okay, sit down. Imagine I am a hungry customer. “Ooh, I am so hungry! I want food! But I need convenience too.” I look through the Meals By Magic menu, and oh boy! What do I find there? Peppered mock pigeon pie and mashed turnip, that sounds great! I want to put that in my belly. So I put the order in—somehow, we’re still working on that part—and… that’s gonna be three crowns, please, sir!
GUBBIN
What? You want me to put in three crowns?
STAN
It’s for the test. Yes. C’mon, Gub. You’ll get them back. The other box is in the kitchen with Betula.
Gubbin mutters as he fishes three coins out of the till.
GUBBIN
Who’s gonna pay three crowns for a pie?
STAN
Remember, it’s not just the pie. You are paying for the convenience. So just put your coins in.
GUBBIN
(grumbles)
All right.
He puts in the coins.
STAN
Close up the box there, yup, just like that. And while you’re doing that, your meal is already being prepared by the Axe and Crown’s expert chefs.
GUBBIN
Yeah? Guess we’ll need some of those.
STAN
(shouts)
Betula, are you all ready in there?
BETULA
(from the kitchen)
One mock pigeon pie, ready to go.
STAN
(to Betula)
Okay! You may press the button when ready!
BETULA
Here we go!
A whoosh of magical energy and a ding! Stan opens his cabinet.
STAN
Bingo! The first ever delivery from Meals By Magic!
GUBBIN
(impressed)
All right! Maybe you’re on to something here, Stanny.
Betula emerges from the kitchen.
BETULA
Did it work?
STAN
You bet it did! Look at that. Piping hot, straight from the oven.
BETULA
Not bad!
STAN
Eh? Eh?
Gubbin is poking at the pie.
GUBBIN
Piping hot, huh?
STAN
Yeah! It’s—wait. How come it’s cold?
BETULA
It’s cold?
GUBBIN
Cold? It’s frozen.
He bonks the pie against the plate.
BETULA
What? I just took that out of the oven.
STAN
Weird. Well, I’m sure we can sort that out. I’ll ask Kal about it. The important thing is, the customer has their meal, and we get paid!
They all head to the kitchen, where Stan opens the other cabinet. Flames crackle.
STAN
Ta-da!
BETULA
Whoa! Fire!
STAN
Hey! No!
GUBBIN
(coughing)
Close that up! Get some water!
STAN
Why are the coins red-hot?
GUBBIN
You melted my money! Stan, I’m gonna kill—
BETULA
Hey! Not now! Give me the bucket! Move that bucket over here.
GUBBIN
Quick, quick, quick!
Stan shoves a wooden bucket over to Betula, who douses the burning cabinet. Steam hisses.
GUBBIN
Man, it smells like feet!
STAN
Is everybody okay?
GUBBIN
Ah, god, that reeks.
STAN
(coughing)
Darn it. That was a really nice cabinet.
GUBBIN
Look, Stan, this is exciting progress and all, but maybe you can work on your new prototype somewhere else than my tavern! Doesn’t your buddy Kalzak have his own damn workshop?
STAN
He did, yeah. Um, it burned down.
BETULA
Shoulda seen that one coming.
STAN
But look, isn’t this amazing? If he hadn’t accidentally burned down his workshop, he wouldn’t have had to rent a room here, and we never would have met and started this cutting-edge new business!
GUBBIN
Yeah, we’re all blessed.
STAN
It’s gonna work, Gubbin.
GUBBIN
Nah, I get it. Engineering something is complicated, it’s gonna be messy. Just don’t burn down my building, okay?
STAN
Okay.
GUBBIN
And you owe me three crowns.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DAY
Stan enters from the kitchen.
STAN
Okay, Kal’s figured it out!
GUBBIN
Oh yeah? Did he get your magic boxes working?
STAN
Well, see, here’s the thing. A pie on a plate is a lot bigger and heavier than a couple of coins.
GUBBIN
You’re right, the man’s a genius.
STAN
I know, right? So when you displace that excess matter, it all gets turned into heat. Or cold. Or something. It’s the law of magical conversation… conversion… it’s a law. It’s a magical law. So… something like that.
GUBBIN
So we make really tiny pies.
STAN
No, c’mon, I’m being serious here.
Wait, now I want tiny pies.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DAY
Betula walks into the back room.
BETULA
Hey Stan, can you please make sure you and Kal clean up in here? I got some people coming by tonight.
STAN
Oh, sure, sure. Hey Betula! That counterweight idea worked. It’s reduced the fire risk by 45 percent!
BETULA
That’s good news.
STAN
I know. Although for some reason you can’t send grapes? It’s super weird.
BETULA
Is that what happened here?
STAN
Huh? Oh no, no, this was us testing out long-distance delivery. Um, it seems the further apart the boxes are, the more the cargo gets… scrambled.
BETULA
Eh. Still edible, though.
STAN
Not really. The stew’s all mixed together with little chunks of bowl—
She’s already eating some.
BETULA
(crunching)
That’s pretty good, actually.
STAN
Oh. Well. You do you.
BETULA
Mmm.
Music sting.
DAYS LATER
Stan is pacing the room.
STAN
All right! Who’s gonna be famous? Who’s gonna turn the restaurant business upside down? Us, that’s who!
BETULA
The brochures do look pretty good.
STAN
Yeah, aren’t they great? Oh man, I can’t believe this is happening.
GUBBIN
(reads)
“Meals by Magic. Grab some of Grandville’s greatest grub, without leaving your home.” Too bad we’re bringing them here for a demo.
BETULA
Hey, I worked hard on these pies.
GUBBIN
Yeah, well, let’s see if they impress all those fancy restaurant and hotel people.
STAN
People are gonna love ’em. Man, I wish Kal could be here.
BETULA
Well…
STAN
I mean, yeah, apart from his shyness.
GUBBIN
Also his tendency to yak away non-stop to his demon friend.
STAN
His guardian spirit.
GUBBIN
His invisible demonic guardian spirit.
STAN
Yes. It’s… sort of like what it is.
GUBBIN
It’s exactly like what it is.
STAN
Anyway, it was a good idea to have him stay in his room and let me do the pitching.
BETULA
Yeah. So… where is everybody?
GUBBIN
Did you get the time wrong on the brochure again?
STAN
(he double-checks)
No, it’s right, eleven AM. Maybe they’re just late, I dunno.
BETULA
All of them?
STAN
Oh geez.
Wait. What the heck?
He paces to the front door and opens it. There’s a noisy but mostly polite crowd outside.
STAN
Hey everybody! The demo’s happening over here! Hello? Hello?
No one answers.
BETULA
What’s going on across the street?
STAN
(completely crestfallen)
Oh no…
GUBBIN
Something going on at the Badger and Bucket?
BETULA
There’s banners up everywhere. “Announcing a new breakthrough in food delivery: Mudlark Meals To Go.”
STAN
They stole our idea! The Badger and Bucket are starting their own delivery business.
GUBBIN
They’re doing what?!
(he hurries to look out the door too)
Those bastards!
BETULA
“Featuring fare from Farloria’s finest food-makers.” Wow, those are some big names. Chateau Lumiera, The Royal Stork… all the Bucket Pubs, of course.
Stan closes the door.
STAN
They stole our idea and beat us to market.
GUBBIN
Do they have our little cabinets and everything?
STAN
They must have been spying on us all this time.
BETULA
This is why we don’t have windows in the back room.
GUBBIN
Or maybe they gave your friend the “wizard” a better offer.
BETULA
No, no, you guys. Look—there’s their big secret.
STAN
Where? What?
GUBBIN
Ahhh. So they just hired a whole bunch of street urchins to deliver food for them.
STAN
They stole your idea, Betula.
BETULA
Well, not really my idea. I mean, it’s basically like, I dunno, you lean out a window, you yell for some kid to bring you the biggest turkey from the shop around the corner. Except without the leaning out your window part.
GUBBIN
Yeah. They must have some kind of dispatch system.
STAN
Aw, man, what are we going to do now?
GUBBIN
I tell you what we’re gonna do now. We are gonna keep working on the Meals by Magic thing.
STAN
You think we still have a shot?
GUBBIN
Sure! Where’s your competitive spirit? You gotta want to win this.
BETULA
It’s true! Think of all the reasons you went with magical delivery.
STAN
Yeah! Our cabinets can get you the food in seconds.
GUBBIN
And no one’s stealing the middle out of your sandwich along the way.
BETULA
Not to mention, there’s plenty of other uses for your magic boxes.
STAN
Really? Are there?
GUBBIN
Well, gee, yeah. Getting cargo instantly from point A to point B, let me think.
STAN
So maybe the post office! Or stores.
BETULA
Yes. Those places. Or I know some folks in the, uh, “shipping” business who’d love to get their hands on some of these boxes.
STAN
Really?
GUBBIN
Yeah, like maybe you’re in harbour and they want to get something past customs inspection a little quicker?
BETULA
That kind of thing.
STAN
Smuggling! That’s brilliant! Woo hoo!
BETULA
Okay, not so loud.
GUBBIN
I bet Betula’s friends would pay good money, even for a prototype.
STAN
Yes, yes! They can be our initial investors. Let me talk to Kal.
BETULA
Maybe don’t use the word “smuggling”.
STAN
Oh, oh! Brain exploding. What if you disguised one of these as a hotel safe?
GUBBIN
Ohh. Interesting!
BETULA
Guys.
GUBBIN
But you’re only gonna get to pull that trick once. Someone’s gonna notice their stuff missing.
BETULA
Okay, settle down. Fellas.
STAN
Sorry, sorry, legitimate tavern owner here. I know nothing of any criminal activities in this neighbourhood.
BETULA
Thanks.
STAN
Do you know any good counterfeiters?

SEAN
Hey everyone. Sean here, and before we get to the super fun outtake, I just want to tell you a little bit more about Shaker & Spoon.
Shaker & Spoon sends boxes to you. So it’s a subscription cocktail service, and it helps you basically make handcrafted drinks made by some of the best mixologists. It has everything in the box except the bottle of alcohol that you need to buy for that month’s box. And you can also pick which box you’re going to get. It’s just super fun, and I can’t tell you how much laughter we had, trying drinks—and they were good drinks. And the boxes are about $40 to $50 a month depending what you pick. But you can get $20 off your first box by going to shakerandspoon.com/albasalix.
And again, quick reminder, we’re running that special offer for the next 30 days. If you go to patreon.com/albasalix or go to albasalix.com and click on the Patreon button, you can learn more, but for a limited time, you’re going to get access to these special stickers. And if we get enough people, we’re going to get two stickers and a coaster out to everyone.
And as always, we want to thank all of you for listening and staying with us. And a super giant thank you to our supporting producers: Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona.
OUTTAKE: TARGET MARKET
BETULA (MARISA KING)
They seem kind of small.
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Yeah, who’s our target marget here?
(stops and breaks character)
Our target Margaret.
ART CARLSON
(laughs)
HUGO JONES
I remember Margaret.
MARISA KING
It is Margaret! She’s our target.
ART CARLSON
Margaret Smith.
HUGO JONES
Margaret. I loved her.
OUTTAKE: WOO HOO
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
(dryly, without feeling)
Woo hoo.
Laughter.
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Woo hoo. Ooo, I did it.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Woo hoo!
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Let me try that again.
Woo hoo.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Woo hoo!
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Stan, is that how you do it?
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Woo hoo!
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Woo hoo.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
You’re so close.
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Okay, maybe I just have to twist my thigh or something.
(a little higher-pitched)
Woo hoo.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
You’re really—you’re nailing the “woo”. I’ve never heard anybody get the “woo” so accurately before. It’s the “hoo” where we run into trouble.
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
It’s making my nipples erect.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Woo hoo!
GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Oh yeah, now I get it! Woo hoo!

SEAN
Hey everyone. Sean here with a couple quick announcements. First of all, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for being with us and getting excited about the return of The Axe & Crown, and sharing it with friends and leaving reviews. We also have a sponsor this week that I’m so excited about: it’s Shaker & Spoon, we talked about them last week, but our next box is on the way and we’re so excited. And I’m going to be back to talk to you about our plans—what we’re going to do with that next cocktail box, at the end before the blooper. But in the meantime, remember that you can get $20 off your first box at shakerandspoon.com/albasalix. Let me tell you, subscription cocktails are the bomb.
And last but not least, we’ve hit the next tier on the special offer we’re running at patreon.com/albasalix. For every five people who sponsor us at the $5 level or higher a month, we add another item into the giveaway tier. Please help me send you cool stuff! Help us get to that next tier. We’re in Tier 2, and I think we can hit Tier 3 if not Tier 4 or higher. I’m not even prepared for Tier 5! Make me scramble. Anyways, that’s it—you can find out more about that by going to patreon.com/albasalix.
And now let’s get you to the show.

ANNOUNCER
The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 4: As Good As Gone.
INT. BAR—SATURDAY MORNING
The soft tapping of a hammer. Stan hums to himself as he puts up decorations.
Betula comes down the stairs.
BETULA
(yawns)
Stan, what are you doing?
STAN
Aw, geez! Sorry, Betula. All this was supposed to be a surprise.
BETULA
The decorations?
STAN
Yeah. It’s for Trølsundag!
BETULA
Yeah, I guessed by the flags everywhere.
STAN
Yeah! It took me ages to find those. Gubbin is gonna go nuts.
BETULA
Yeah, he is. Stan, I don’t think this is a good idea.
STAN
What? Why not?
Gubbin trudges in.
GUBBIN
(half-asleep)
What the hell are you guys doing up so early?
STAN
It’s Saturday! Also known as Brunch Day!
GUBBIN
It’s too early for brunch. Or day. This is getting ridiculous.
STAN
Sorry, Gub. I wanted to get the decorations done before you were up, so it’d be a surprise.
GUBBIN
Wanted what to be a surprise?
He looks around.
GUBBIN
Oh no.
No, no, no, no no. You didn’t.
STAN
Surprise!
GUBBIN
What the hell were you thinking?! No, never mind. I don’t care. Get all this crap off my walls!
STAN
But… it’s Trølsundag! It’s your national holiday!
GUBBIN
Not my national holiday.
BETULA
Sorry, Stan.
STAN
But I made special menus and everything! I thought maybe you could make kling klangs, and we’ve still got some of that weird coal cheese stuff. I figure any human who can eat some and keep it down, we give them their meal for free!
GUBBIN
Don’t you waste our food on your stupid brunch crowd.
STAN
I figured out how to colour the beer blue, too. And look! Look at these placemats. See? They’ve got sayings in Trølsig, so people can learn the language.
Gubbin takes a paper placemat.
GUBBIN
“Whan iss in der boat, geschtarten paddlen.”
BETULA
That’s not grammatical.
STAN
Aw man. Sorry, I should have run it past you guys. But, you know… surprise!
GUBBIN
Why the hell’s it written like that, anyway?
BETULA
I guess it’s supposed to look like runes?
STAN
Isn’t that cool? I’m just gonna put up these last two flags.
GUBBIN
No. Stop.
STAN
What’s the matter, Gubbin?
GUBBIN
Take it all down. Now.
STAN
Why?
GUBBIN
Brunch is cancelled on account of the bartender has a headache!
He stomps away behind the bar, and pours himself a drink.
STAN
But I made centerpieces and everything.
BETULA
Take it down, Stan.
STAN
I don’t understand. I thought Trølsundag was a pretty big party for you guys.
BETULA
Look. It is a big national holiday.
STAN
When Torun the Assertive pulled the big sword from the furnace and led the trolls to independence from Snögard, right?
BETULA
Yeah.
STAN
See? I’ve read stuff. Down with the ice giant overlords and Trølsig for the trolls!
BETULA
Right. But that’s the trouble. A lot of people thought that’s all Trølsund should be—troll country. Never mind that giants and goblins and treefolk have been living there for a thousand years.
STAN
Oh.
BETULA
Next thing you know, they’re trying to send everyone else “back to the mountains”. Where they never lived in the first place.
STAN
But you guys didn’t think that.
BETULA
No. But Gubbin’s Ma, my Aunt Tegrun, she was all in.
STAN
Oh. Oh. Ouch.
Gubbin wanders back.
GUBBIN
Yeah. Why do you think I left home?
STAN
I’m so sorry, Gubbin. Is that how you ended up here?
GUBBIN
Yeah. Left home, worked on ships, ended up in Farloria and joined the army.
Place isn’t always the greatest, but at least it’s better sometimes, you know?
And Ma, she can’t call me a coward any more.
STAN
No. Holy crow.
GUBBIN
Yeah. So all these flags and banners and things, they kind of leave a bad taste, you know?
STAN
I get it. I totally get it. I’m sorry, Gubbin. And Betula. I did a bad thing.
GUBBIN
Just get them out of here.
STAN
Sure thing.
He goes about his task.
STAN
Is it okay if we still do brunch?
GUBBIN
Eh, sure.
STAN
So… is there a better holiday? One without the connotations?
BETULA
Solstice is coming up.
STAN
Yeah, but we already have Solstice! Humans do that. Winter festival! Singing songs, dressing up like talking trees…
BETULA
Also somewhat problematic, but never mind.
STAN
Do you guys have different traditions for Solstice? Like, what did you do last year?
GUBBIN
Eh, last year wasn’t a good year.
STAN
Oh. Right. That must have been around the time of the Johann incident.
GUBBIN
Yeah. You could say the mood was a little heavy.
STAN
Okay, so what did you do when you were kids?
BETULA
Uh… Bobbing for flaming plums? That was always fun.
STAN
Sorry—plums that are on fire?
BETULA
Making snow boulders. Setting fire to things behind the fire department. Heh. You used to do that, didn’t you, Uncle?
GUBBIN
Yeah. That was a good time.
Or First Night. The goblin families down the road used to go house to house, visiting everyone with presents. One year they gave me this cutest little toy trebuchet.
STAN
Aww! I can totally see that. Little baby Gubbin, flinging things around, settin’ traps. Hey, is that how you got into engineering?
GUBBIN
Come to think of it—yeah, probably.
STAN
That is adorable.
BETULA
What about you, Stan? What did your family do at Solstice?
STAN
Oh, it was very traditional. Nothing fancy—that would have meant just spending money. So we just did the usual Solstice cake, and after dinner we’d all light candles and do New Year’s wishes.
BETULA
That’s where you write your wish for the year on a paper and burn it?
STAN
Yeah. Wait, do you not do that?
BETULA
It sounds a little bit like gluck-vin-oth.
GUBBIN
Yeah, kinda.
BETULA
Gluck-vin is… how would you say it?
GUBBIN
Like good fortune.
BETULA
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody says one special thing that happened to them this year. Something you feel thankful for. And then one thing you pledge to do in the coming year, that’s the oth.
STAN
Oh! You know, I like that. So it’s not just a wish, it’s actually gettin’ things done.
GUBBIN AND BETULA
Ehh…
STAN
What else? What else? Tell me more. Tell me more. I want to know everything. More troll traditions! Or “troll-ditions”. Eh? See what I did there?
GUBBIN
Well, there’s Efgnar.
BETULA
(groans)
STAN
Ef-gnar? What is that? Is that a food? Is that a parade? What’s Efgnar?
GUBBIN
It’s a giant beast like a bear, who comes and visits all the children.
STAN
Oh! And then gives them candy, like Old Mother Blizzard?
GUBBIN
Nah. She roars in their faces, raaaargh!
STAN
Oog.
GUBBIN
And if they run away, she chases them down and eats them slowly.
STAN
Okay, that’s traumatizing.
GUBBIN
And if they stand their ground, they get a pie made from the other children.
STAN
I… like pie…
GUBBIN
Hey, Betula! You should play the Efgnar this year.
BETULA
Uncle. I’m not doing that again.
STAN
Wait a minute, hang on. You played the Efgnar?
BETULA
Yeah. So on Midwinter’s Night, someone dresses up as the Efgnar and roars at all the kids. Usually it was me, since I was the biggest.
STAN
Oh wow! Do you think that maybe you could get dressed up again as the Efgnar?
BETULA
No.
STAN
C’mon! That would be so cool.
BETULA
Why don’t you dress up as the Efgnar? You could show those little brats who’s boss.
STAN
Really? Oh, sweet!
It sounds kinda mean, though.
BETULA
Well, there’s always Üpsi-dag.
GUBBIN
Heh heh, yeah.
STAN
What’s that?
BETULA
Upside Down Day. It’s a couple days before the solstice. They pick a foolish person from the village and make them supreme ruler.
STAN
Okay, now that sounds like a role I was born to play.
GUBBIN
Yeah! You’d be a prime candidate. You’d be waited on hand and foot. Your word would literally be law for the whole week leading up to the solstice!
STAN
Aw, that is so cool! It’s about time old Stanway Gerard got what’s been coming to him.
GUBBIN
Yes, yes, yes, we gotta do that. We gotta do that!
BETULA
Well… Uncle’s leaving out the bit at the end where the supreme ruler is thrown off a cliff as a ritual sacrifice to Bu-Schkrinda, the god of tactful silence.
STAN
I’m sorry, what?
GUBBIN
Nobody does that any more.
BETULA
Yes, they do!
GUBBIN
Well, okay, but they put a net at the bottom now.
STAN
Are all your customs completely terrifying?
GUBBIN
Don’t worry, kid, there’s no good cliffs around here anyway.
Stan rolls up the last flag.
STAN
All right. That’s all the flags and things down.
BETULA
Thanks Stan.
GUBBIN
Yeah. Good job.
STAN
I’m declaring a brand new tradition here. Solstice is coming up, right? So we’re gonna have a party. Everyone’s gonna be invited. The whole neighbourhood. Trolls, humans, goblins, raccoons, whoever else. Doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from, you’re welcome here. Food and drink are all on me!
GUBBIN
You sure I couldn’t interest you in Üpsi-dag?
Music sting.
INT. BAR—SOLSTICE NIGHT
A raucous party: singing and laughter in the background.
BETULA
Here you go, two more pints!
Stan staggers downstairs.
STAN
(exhausted)
Hey Betula. How are we doing?
BETULA
Stan! You okay there?
STAN
Oh, yeah, yeah, I’ll live. Probably.
BETULA
You took off the costume.
STAN
Well, yeah. Not much point after the kids tore my head off. It was already a mess. You know, they really kick hard, those kids.
BETULA
Stan, you’re supposed to roar.
STAN
I did roar! But the one little guy screamed, and I felt so bad about scaring him.
BETULA
That’s the whole point! You showed weakness, and they all ganged up on you.
STAN
I know, I know. Next year, someone else is definitely playing the Efgnar.
BETULA
No, no, you can do it. You just have to stay strong. And roar!
(to a customer)
Another round? Coming up.
She goes about pouring a few more pints.
STAN
So? What’s your good fortune? Something that came true for you this year?
BETULA
Oh, are we doing gluck-vin-oth?
STAN
Sure!
BETULA
I dunno. I guess I found something I’m good at. Bartending and, you know, being a broker. Knowing the right people and connecting them.
STAN
That’s cool. You’ve really been making a name for yourself since you got here.
BETULA
And if I have a New Year pledge… maybe it’s to stick around. Most of my life I’d spend a few months in one place and then get bored or get in trouble, and just run away somewhere else. It feels nice to finally stay put for a little while.
STAN
I’m glad.
BETULA
Yeah.
What about you?
STAN
Oh, my good fortune? It’s the Axe and Crown. Everything about it.
BETULA
I guess that’s sort of a gimme.
STAN
Well, yeah. You know, when my dad died, I thought I was gonna follow in his footsteps. I was gonna sweep in and reinvent the whole hospitality industry. Have a whole chain of hotels. But… you know me. That’s not me. I really found a home here.
BETULA
And what’s your big pledge for the new year? Make it big in magic?
STAN
(laughs)
Naw. All this company-founding stuff, it’s fun, it’s great. Maybe it’ll make us money. Probably not. But well, look around.
See this? This is what I really want. I want to make a place for people. Everybody. I just want to take care of everyone, and help them have a good time.
BETULA
Even if you get beat up a little?
STAN
Heh. Maybe.
Please promise you’ll be the Efgnar next year.
BETULA
I’ll think about it.
CUSTOMER
Excuse me. Excuse me! I ordered a pigeon pie some minutes ago.
BETULA
Hang on, I’ll ask.
She pushes open the kitchen door.
BETULA
(shouts)
Uncle? How’s that pie coming along?
GUBBIN
(shouts)
Just gimme a minute.
BETULA
Hey, we got orders piling up here, just so you know! Two plates of stonebread and a whole bunch of orders for stew.
GUBBIN
Yeah, yeah, I’m working on it, all right?
BETULA
Oh, you’re working on it! If you say so.
She returns to the bar.
BETULA
Yeah, just a couple more minutes.
STAN
Well, Gubbin’s not allowed to make fun of your cooking any more.
BETULA
Right?
STAN
Why isn’t he out here, by the way?
BETULA
He wanted to swap. Said he’d had enough of people for the night.
STAN
I kinda get that.
Maybe I should check on him. See if he needs any help.
BETULA
Yeah, would you?
INT. KITCHEN—CONTINUOUS
Fire crackles and food bubbles as Stan enters.
STAN
Whoa, whoa, things on fire! Things on fire!
He rushes around putting lids on pots.
GUBBIN
Stan, get out. Let a troll work!
STAN
Gubbin, are you okay? We’ve got customers waiting for their…
Oh.
JOHANN
Hey there.
STAN
Johann.
GUBBIN
Kid, we’re having a moment, all right?
JOHANN
(purrs)
Mmm, aren’t we?
STAN
I can see that. Probably a little risky having your shirt off in a kitchen full of bubbling pots and pans, don’t you think?
JOHANN
It adds a little excitement to everything.
STAN
Look, do you want me to take over? Why don’t you two just, uh, get a room and I’ll make the food?
GUBBIN
Dammit, Stan…
STAN
Our patrons need dinner and you guys are busy. Go.
GUBBIN
All right, all right, all right.
JOHANN
It’s probably safer for everyone, Gubs.
GUBBIN
Okay. C’mon, Yo-yo. Let’s go.
Just lemme grab this spatula…
He heads out the door.
JOHANN
Okay! Bye, um… Stan, is it?
STAN
That’s right. Stan, yeah.
Stan steps in front of the door.
JOHANN
Um, can I go upstairs now? I thought you were gonna take over.
STAN
Yeah, I just… I wanted to say.
Whatever you and Gubbin get up to, that’s your business.
JOHANN
Yeah. It is.
STAN
But you know, you just… better tread carefully.
JOHANN
Excuse me?
STAN
Do you know how broken up he was over you?
JOHANN
Yeah, yeah, apparently he was kind of a mess for a while.
STAN
Yeah, that’s one way to put it, a mess.
He didn’t use the kitchen for months, did you know that? No one was even allowed in here. This room just sat gathering dust.
JOHANN
Come on. Did he tell you that?
STAN
Of course he didn’t tell me that. He’s Gubbin. He’s a big tough old troll. We had to break into this kitchen ourselves before he told us the whole story.
JOHANN
Oh.
STAN
So I just wanted you to know that… if you do anything to hurt him again, I will do terrible things to you.
JOHANN
Says the guy who just got beaten up by a bunch of little kids.
STAN
Yeah. Says that guy.
(low and dangerous)
So have fun. But you better be good to my friend, or I will kick your extremely handsome ass.
JOHANN
That’s kinda hot.
STAN
Sorry?
JOHANN
Kidding! I’m kidding.
STAN
I’m not.
JOHANN
Kay.
STAN
(cheery again)
Happy Solstice, Johann!
He turns away takes down a big frying pan.
JOHANN
Happy Solstice.
Johann slips out the door.

SEAN
Hey. Sean here, and Eli wanted to say thank you to each and every one of you, but also wish you a happy holiday. This has been such an amazing journey, and we couldn’t do it without all of you. So please accept our sincerest wishes for a joyous holiday for each and every one of you. And a super giant thank you to our supporting producers, Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona.
Our sponsor this week is Shaker & Spoon. I talked about it off the top—Eli and I ordered the first box, and had it shipped to some friends in Buffalo, and we went and had a crazy fun rum party cocktail evening. Shaker & Spoon is a subscription cocktail service where they send you a box every month. It’s so much fun because these are amazing drinks, and it’s crazy what’s packed into this box. All you have to add is the bottle of alcohol for that box. So we picked a rum box, but we picked a special Italian box for our next one, because we want to surprise some of our friends here in Hamilton with an Italian themed holiday party—I don’t know why it’s Italian. It’s just because I like prosecco. But hey, it’s gonna be super fun. And you can find out more and get $20 off your first box at shakerandspoon.com/albasalix.
And again, we wish you, with cocktails or without, a truly, truly, joyous holiday.

Well, because it’s fun! Oo, it’s so much fun! Look, Stan! We get to throw you off a cliff. You could be like a bird. You could pretend you’re a bird.

Episode 4: As Good As Gone.
INT. BAR—MORNING
BETULA
Hey Stan.
STAN
Oh. Hey, Betula.
BETULA
You okay there?
STAN
Yeah, you know me, I’m—
No, actually, not really.
BETULA
What’s up? Do you need a hand?
She takes a seat next to him.
STAN
No…
BETULA
Isn’t your new launch for Meals by Magic happening this week?
STAN
No. I’m afraid Meals By Magic is done.
BETULA
What? Why? What happened?
STAN
I just found out Kalzak got… called away. He left a note, but it’s not very clear. Something about an unpaid debt or something.
BETULA
Oh. That’s too bad. But why does that mean the company’s done? Isn’t he coming back?
STAN
I don’t think so.
BETULA
Wait. Are we talking “called away” to another dimension?
STAN
Yeah. Look, over in the corner there, where he always sits, see? His chair’s gone and there’s just a scorched circle of runes on the floor.
BETULA
Oh. Oh yeah, that’s not a good sign.
And Uncle’s gonna have a fit.
STAN
Yeah. He already lost it on me. I’ll pay to repair it. I just… yeah.
BETULA
That’s rough. I’m sorry, Stan.
STAN
He was a good guy, really. Deep down, I mean. Yeah, he was strange, but also, you know… really strange.
BETULA
Just to be clear, though—he’s not actually dead, right?
STAN
I don’t think so? The note’s in his handwriting. I guess they just need him to pay back his eternal debt or something, whatever that means.
BETULA
Oh. Yeah. That’s good, then. I’m sure he’s… fine.
STAN
(reassured)
Yeah. Thanks, Betula.
BETULA
Right.
Does he have next of kin? Do they need to be told?
STAN
He’s got some family, but they’d been estranged for a long time.
BETULA
That tracks.
STAN
Gubbin’s upstairs sorting through his stuff. I’ll ask if he can find a name or an address or something.
Gubbin comes downstairs, followed by a rattling, flapping noise.
NEV
Grawk!
GUBBIN
Okay, can someone please deal with this goddamn bird? Stop it!
BETULA
What is that?
STAN
Oh, that’s another thing. This is Kalzak’s… friend, Nev.
NEV
Rawk! Not any more!
STAN
Nev, Betula. Betula, this is Nev.
BETULA
Hi?
NEV
Rark!
STAN
I think Kalzak raised him as part of this big thesis project when he was at school, and he’s just been taking care of him ever since.
NEV
Not any more! Caw!
GUBBIN
Agh!
So when you say “raised”, I’m guessing you don’t mean raised from a baby.
STAN
Yeah, more like raised from… a skeleton.
GUBBIN
Uh huh.
BETULA
A skeleton with eyes. That’s the part that’s creeping me out.
STAN
Yeah, I get that. You know, hanging out with a previously-alive raven, takes some getting used to, but Kal was really fond of him.
NEV
Not any more!
BETULA
Does he say anything else?
STAN
Not that I’ve heard. I think maybe it’s a punchline to an old joke that Kal taught him?
BETULA
Yeah, that’s… pretty funny.
NEV
Not any more!
GUBBIN
Yeah, you try sleeping with that going on in the room above you.
NEV
Rawwk!
GUBBIN
Gah!
This is typical. Frickin’ wizards, disappearing and leaving us with their weird familiars.
BETULA
Yeah, gosh, ’cause that happens so often.
GUBBIN
Oh, you weren’t here when that sea witch was here with her friend the squid. I had half a dozen guests yelling in my face that the cleaning staff stole all their jewellery.
BETULA
Wait a minute. When did you ever have cleaning staff?
GUBBIN
I didn’t! It was the squid! It kept sneaking out of her room during the day. She would lock all the doors and windows but if there was even the tiniest crack—I’m talking infinitesimal—that squid could still squeeze out.
STAN
What! That’s amazing.
GUBBIN
And she wouldn’t even correct him. She was all like, “Oh, what a clever boy you are. Isn’t he clever? Blah blah blah!”
Bah. Squids! You can’t trust ’em!
NEV
Not any more!
GUBBIN
I swear, we should just ban ’em all from the premises. No pets, no wizards, no witches, no familiars, no nothing.
STAN
Aw, c’mon, Gub. You can’t let one poorly-raised squid spoil everything.
GUBBIN
Pah!
STAN
Look. I’ll take care of him. Unless either of you wants to?
BETULA
Well, I can’t exactly cook him. There’s no meat on him.
NEV
Not any more!
STAN
That’s not actually what I meant. I’ll keep him in my room or something.
BETULA
Oh, sorry.
So then… what does he eat, exactly?
STAN
Nothing, as far as I can tell.
BETULA
I mean, no stomach.
STAN
Yeah.
BETULA
So, did you find an address in Kal’s room, Uncle? Stan wants to reach out to his relatives.
GUBBIN
Nah. He’s got books and books and notebooks and books of notes, all written in code, or maybe some kinda demon language, maybe both? I don’t know.
STAN
Nev? Do you know where Kal’s family are?
NEV
Dawk! Not any more!
GUBBIN
Well, this is gonna be heaps of fun.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—DAY
Stan enters from the street.
STAN
Okay, so some good news. Grandville University of Thaumaturgical Elucidation still had Kal’s emergency contact info on file from when he was a student. They’re trying to contact his family now.
BETULA
Well, that’s good news.
STAN
Also, they want me to explain what happened and I’m not sure what to tell them.
BETULA
Well, his family knew he was going to the University, so they probably knew he was doing weird magic.
STAN
Yeah, I don’t think they approved.
BETULA
What makes you say that?
STAN
Kal told me his mother didn’t approve.
BETULA
Right.
Hey… his latest research and stuff, that probably belonged to your company, right?
STAN
Hmm? Oh, we never really discussed that. I guess we were just too excited about designing the product.
BETULA
But it’s not like anyone’s going to come looking for his prototype magical transportation boxes or anything.
STAN
Probably not. Why?
BETULA
Well, I’m just saying, we should probably keep those safe. Just in case Kal gets back and wants to continue working on them.
STAN
Sure. I guess.
BETULA
Cool. Cool cool cool.
STAN
Not like it matters. There really wasn’t anything new or groundbreaking about what we were doing. We were just a couple of clueless dudes messing around with magic and convincing ourselves we were doing something special.
BETULA
Aw, Stan. You never know. I thought you guys were really on to something.
NEV
Awk! Not any more!
STAN
Gee, thanks Nev.
Any luck finding a foster home for Mister Bone Bird over here?
BETULA
Not yet. I contacted a couple of sanctuaries, but they’re not taking in any new animals and/or skeletons. So no one at the university was interested?
STAN
No. I think they have some weird superstition about inheriting someone else’s familiar.
BETULA
Heh. What, like history might repeat itself and they might end up dragged away to a hell dimension like Kal?
STAN
Yeah, sure, that sort of thing.
BETULA
I don’t suppose we could release him back into the wild?
NEV
Not any more!
STAN
No, I don’t think so. Turns out he doesn’t eat, but he sure does like to drink, though. Speaking of, do you know where to get some formaldehyde? Kal had a bottle of it in his room, but—
NEV
(belches)
Not any more!
STAN
We pretty much toasted that.
BETULA
You could ask at Gurney’s Funeral Home? Or the alchemist’s over on Bridge Street.
Gubbin comes downstairs. Nev stalks over and flaps angrily.
NEV
Rawwk!
GUBBIN
Agh! Haven’t you got rid of that damn bird yet?
NEV
Rawwk!
STAN
Not yet.
GUBBIN
He’s freaking out all my patrons, and honestly, he’s freaking me out too.
BETULA
We’re working on it.
GUBBIN
Can’t you make a bone broth out of him or something?
NEV
Rawwwwwk!
BETULA
Uh, would you eat soup made from a formaldehyde-soaked undead bird?
GUBBIN
…I’m sure someone would.
STAN
Maybe the funeral home needs a mascot or something. “Welcome to Gurney’s! Raawk!”
NEV
Aawwwk!
GUBBIN
You know what, maybe call a taxidermist. Stick him up on the wall.
NEV
Awwk! Not any more!
GUBBIN
Come here, you!
He chases Nev around the room, chairs thud to the floor.
NEV
Not any more! Not any more!
GUBBIN
I swear to God.
STAN
Can you guys take it outside?
NEV
Awwk!
INT. BAR—NIGHT
The bar is empty. Betula is putting chairs up on tables while Stan sweeps the floor.
STAN
How you doing?
BETULA
(yawns)
All right. I’m gonna turn in or I’m gonna be useless for brunch tomorrow.
STAN
Sure, I got the rest. Night, Betula.
BETULA
Night, Stan.
She heads upstairs.
The outside door rattles, and creaks open.
STAN
Betula, I thought you said you locked up?
Footsteps slowly enter.
STAN
Uh… sorry, friend, we’re closed for the night.
The door creaks shut and slams.
YARTHA
(deep, sinister, hissing voice)
You… know… Kalzak.
Yartha stalks over to the bar, looking over Stan.
STAN
He was staying here for a little bit, yeah.
Uh, uh, hi, hello, can I help you?
YARTHA
You must be Stanway.
STAN
(backing away)
Oh! Well, yes. Yes I am. Stanway Gerrard. But how did you…
YARTHA
My son wrote to us a few times in the past months and he spoke of a young man he was working with, a Stanway Gerrard.
STAN
That would be me, yes. Stan is fine.
YARTHA
Stan, then.
STAN
So you’re Kal’s…?
YARTHA
I am his mother. You may call me Yartha.
STAN
Yartha! That is a nice name. Yeah, I can see a little of the family resemblance there—
YARTHA
Where did it happen?
STAN
Oh, right. “It”, yes. Um, “it” happened right over here. Where the… um…
YARTHA
Where the scorch marks are.
STAN
Yes, yes. And I found this note here.
He hands it to Yartha.
YARTHA
We knew it would come to this one day. And yet I find myself unprepared.
Silence.
STAN
If there’s anything that I can do…
YARTHA
Yes. I am here to collect my son’s worldly goods.
STAN
Oh. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well. Follow me. Right this way, I’ll show you to his room.
They ascend the stairs to the third floor.
STAN
So, uh, I don’t know much about you. He didn’t talk much about his family.
YARTHA
Of course not.
STAN
Are you in the… magic business as well? What is it that you do?
YARTHA
I am not in the magic business.
Stan unlocks the door, and they step inside.
STAN
Fair enough. So this is Kal’s room. Was Kal’s room. Is. Is Kal’s room. Still is, it’s completely his room, I guess, since he’s only gone away.
So, uh…
YARTHA
To answer your question, I specialize in early childhood education.
Silence.
STAN
You’re… really! I would not have guessed that.
YARTHA
You find my appearance atypical for a teacher.
STAN
Maybe a little?
YARTHA
Do I frighten you?
STAN
I’m terrified. I have to let you know, I am currently extremely terrified.
YARTHA
That is excellent.
STAN
Okay, that’s fine.
The hood thing. Arriving in the middle of the night. The claws.
YARTHA
Children today are too coddled. Their parents try to shield them from any fear, any pain, any tiny inconvenience—any experience that would teach them to live in the real world.
STAN
And so you, uh, frighten them?
YARTHA
My partner and I run a night camp in the Woeful Woods where children can safely become lost, be menaced by monsters and villains, and then escape, hungry but unharmed, back to their parent or guardian as wiser, more capable people.
STAN
That’s kind of amazing. So… Kal didn’t exactly follow in your footsteps.
YARTHA
We made many mistakes as parents. We did too much for him. He never learned to make his own way. We sent him off to Hazelbroke College, where he turned to begging favours from dark forces. At first it was help on a pop quiz here and there, but then it was a term paper, or a major research project.
STAN
Oh no.
YARTHA
Soon he was promising everything to his so-called “friends” below just to avoid his turn cleaning the common room. He dropped out of college, applied to that awful university, dropped out of university—I’m afraid that’s when he stopped talking to us. Until recently.
STAN
Oh. I’m sorry—that’s really sad.
YARTHA
And now the only sign of his presence is a heap of arcane diagrams and a scorched circle on the floor.
I’m sorry about that, by the way—can we help pay for some of the damage?
STAN
Oh, no, no, that’s awfully nice of you. You don’t have to—we deal with damage from our guests every day.
YARTHA
People are so inconsiderate.
STAN
I know.
YARTHA
No, allow me to offer you some recompense. Skies above, he could have burned down the building on his way out.
STAN
No, really—
YARTHA
Take the money, Stanway Gerrard.
STAN
Y‑yes, Ma’am. Yes. Thank you very much.
She gives him a bag of coins.
YARTHA
My son spoke quite highly of you, you know.
STAN
He did? Really?
YARTHA
You were colleagues, yes?
STAN
We were just working together. And not on any summoning type thing. Or I don’t think it was anything like that.
YARTHA
You gave him hope. He spoke of moving away from the darker arts. He said that you believed in him. Trusted him.
STAN
Well, yeah, I…
YARTHA
I fear that we stopped trusting, long ago.
STAN
I don’t know what to say.
YARTHA
Do not be troubled. We loved him. We still do. But there were so many times we wanted to believe that he was returning to us. Only to lose him further down the path he had chosen. And now, this is where we find ourselves.
STAN
I’m sorry things didn’t work out better.
YARTHA
Perhaps they will in the end. Who can say? Life is full of delight and disappointment, and not often in equal share. I am glad you were there for my Kalzak.
STAN
Thanks. Me too.
YARTHA
Your magic food delivery business gave him hope. And you gave him friendship.
STAN
I’d like to think so.
Yartha sifts through a few of the items.
YARTHA
I wish we had done more.
STAN
We always do. We always wish we’d done more for our friends and our family.
YARTHA
We failed him.
STAN
You don’t know that. Maybe if you’d done the “right” thing, quote unquote, he’d have turned out exactly the same. You can’t ever know for sure.
YARTHA
Perhaps. But it is the reason I now do what I do.
STAN
You mean, teaching kids by frightening them out of their wits.
YARTHA
Indeed.
STAN
Well, there you go—think of all those kids you’ve helped. It probably would have done me some good, I’ll tell you. I coulda used an experience like that to give me a little backbone. A little smarts.
YARTHA
That is kind of you to say.
STAN
So… do you want me to help you pack up all his stuff? I mean, these are all his notes from the business but I can’t read a word of them.
YARTHA
If you have a place to keep these notes, then keep them. I have no use for them. Ah! But look—he kept this lantern. This we gave him when he left home.
Perhaps—yes. I believe I will take this.
What is under this sheet?
STAN
Oh, no, don’t—
Yartha pulls a sheet from a cage.
NEV
Rark!
YARTHA
Oh! What a charming beast! Greetings!
STAN
This is Nev—Nev, this is Yartha.
NEV
Raaark!
YARTHA
I am delighted to meet you too, dear Nev—or, pardon me, Rark!
NEV
Raark raark caw!
STAN
You speak raven?
YARTHA
I speak a dialect. Nev is a coastal raven—
NEV
Not any more!
YARTHA
Oh, indeed, was a coastal raven, but I can understand most of what he says.
STAN
Would you be interested in taking home a… new skeletal bird friend?
NEV
Caw! Caw?
YARTHA
He would be a terrifying addition to our staff. Yes! I will certainly take you, if you like. Will you come with us, Nev?
NEV
Damn right! Finally!
STAN
Woo hoo!
NEV
Caw!
INT. BAR—EARLY MORNING
Betula, Gubbin and Stan are setting up the tables for brunch service.
STAN
Tablecloths and placemats are done. How we coming on the silverware?
BETULA
(yawning)
Slow down there, bronco. I’m on it. There’s plenty of time before the brunch crowd arrives.
GUBBIN
You can help me with the plates.
STAN
Okay.
GUBBIN
Thank the gods that bird is gone.
STAN
Yeah. He and Kalzak’s mom took to each other pretty fast.
GUBBIN
Well… she was probably right. You were good for Kalzak.
STAN
Aw, thanks, Gubbin.
BETULA
Yeah, the last couple weeks, before he went away, I think I actually saw him in a fresh robe once or twice.
A magical whoosh.
STAN
I wish I had done more. I didn’t realize how important this business was to him.
GUBBIN
Sometimes what you can do is what you can do.
BETULA
(sniffs)
Does anyone else smell something burning?
A soft crackling noise, slowly growing into a substantial fire.
STAN
There’s no food on yet, right?
GUBBIN
Stan! Table three on fire!
STAN
It’s the tablecloth! I got it. Ow! Ow! Water! We need water!
Betula heaves a bucket of sand, and the flames go out instantly.
BETULA
Sand is better. There we go. Everything’s fine.
GUBBIN
Everything is NOT fine! No more candles at brunch!
STAN
The candles weren’t lit.
GUBBIN
No candles, no flambé, no burning anything! I got half a mind to get rid of the stove too!
BETULA
No, no, it’s that circle in the corner again.
STAN
The circle?!
BETULA
The one that took Kal away! That one.
GUBBIN
It’s back?! Goddammit, we just cleaned that up.
STAN
But nobody disappeared this time… right?
BETULA
No—something appeared.
STAN
What?
BETULA
A postcard?
STAN
Let me see!
GUBBIN
That’s it. How the hell do we get rid of a pentagram?
STAN
(reading with difficulty)
“Dear Stan. Sorry had to bail. Big rush, no time. Working…” Here, hold on, does that say “desk job”?
BETULA
I think so.
STAN
“Working desk job, so much paperwork, but I’ll live, ha ha. Sorry about food biz. Talk soon. Peace—Kal.”
BETULA
Wow. He’s alive. And at a desk job?
GUBBIN
Yup, he’s in hell for sure.
STAN
I’m thinking we shouldn’t seat anyone at Table 3 for a while.
GUBBIN
Good idea. Put a cloth over it. A big one.

OUTTAKE: COMEDY
STAN (ART CARLSON)
(deep announcer voice)
What is the deal with cart food?
Laughter.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
You know what I’m saying? Every time you’re on a cart between villages, you just get the same food over and over again. And it’s terrible! Like for example, every time I’m on a cart, they bring you a little piece of meat and it has grill marks on it. What am I supposed to imagine? That they have an open flame grill at the front of the cart that I…? It makes no sense. Anyway! I’m gonna be here all week. G’night!
Laughter.
MARISA KING
It’s Stan doing—it’s Stan-d-up!

It’s Stannnn-d-up comedy!

Episode 5: Off And Running.
INT. BAR—MORNING
Stan enters from the street.
STAN
Morning, guys!
GUBBIN
Hey Stan.
BETULA
Hey Stan. How was the market?
Stan starts going through his shopping bags.
STAN
So good. I got some amazing cheeses for brunch tomorrow, I got some new candles for the tables—especially for Table 3. Oh, and I met this amazing woman who’s running for town council.
GUBBIN
I’m confused.
STAN
About what?
GUBBIN
You used “amazing” and “running for council” in the same sentence.
Stan pulls out a pamphlet.
STAN
Ha ha ha. Look, I’m being serious. Her name’s Constance Moldvay and she’s all about making the city safer for everyone. Better roads and sewers, cracking down on polluting industries. I told her we’d vote for her!
GUBBIN
Now, see, there are three things wrong with that statement. First of all, you ain’t me, and you don’t get to say who I vote for.
STAN
Yeah, sorry, I just got overexcited.
GUBBIN
Especially because secondly, I don’t vote.
STAN
Wait, what? What? Gubbin, you have to vote.
GUBBIN
Councillors, they’re all the same. They say they’re gonna stop corruption and help the poor and bla de bla de bla. And then they get elected and whoops, it all just slipped outta their mind. And the rare time they do come up with a good idea, the King and/or Queen suddenly decides nope! Can’t possibly do that!
So what good are they?
STAN
Listen, Constance is different. She gets things done. Look, it says it right here on the pamphlet. See? She gets things done.
GUBBIN
I see that.
STAN
Do you remember when Pomfritz’s Potions were dumping their effluent into the river?
BETULA
Geez. That sounds bad.
GUBBIN
You kidding? It was great! That big outbreak of flying fish? You could walk out the front door here and catch ’em without a boat! We were serving those up all summer.
STAN
Yeah, but it wasn’t just the fish. Do you know how many kids were born with three eyes that year?
BETULA
Is that where they all came from? I was wondering.
GUBBIN
Hey, it was great for the hat business here in town. Hiding all those third eyes, they had to pull ’em down low… they looked really fashionable, those kids.
STAN
It’s worse that all that. It turns out old Mister Pomfritz was good buddies with the Lord Mayor. So no one was doing anything about the dumping—except Constance Moldvay! She led a big protest outside the town hall. “Keep our river clean! Nix the elixir mixers!” They had to clean up or move out of town!
BETULA
So they cleaned up?
STAN
No, they moved out of town. All their potions are brewed in Balgomar now.
BETULA
Yeah, that figures.
GUBBIN
Yeah. Too bad for all the folks that worked there.
STAN
The point is, it worked. No more third eyes, no more fires breaking out on the river.
GUBBIN
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hooray for Constance.
STAN
And that’s why I’m voting for her.
GUBBIN
No you’re not. Which brings me to my third point. This pamphlet says Ward Two. You’re living on the other side of the river now, kid.
STAN
Oh darn, you’re right. I didn’t even think about that! Wait. What ward are we in, anyway?
GUBBIN
Ward Seven, South Shore—Bogtown.
STAN
And who’s our current councillor?
GUBBIN
Mister Duffin Braithwick. Used to run a big shipping company down at the docks. He’s been on the council for about a thousand years. Barely shows up for meetings any more, just collects his pay and goes off to play golf his developer buddies.
STAN
Ugh.
GUBBIN
Drives me nuts!
STAN
We need someone like Constance to run in our ward.
BETULA
Huh. You ever think about running for council, Uncle?
GUBBIN
I had not considered it, no.
STAN
People would totally vote for you! You’re a fixture in this neighbourhood. This place is a beloved institution.
GUBBIN
Hah. If you say so.
STAN
I do say so.
GUBBIN
You think I got time to sit on my butt in the council chambers listening to speeches about sewage treatment options?
BETULA
You said the incumbent guy never shows up to council meetings.
GUBBIN
Let alone getting out there shaking hands and smiling big fake smiles for the voters.
STAN
Aw, c’mon, Gubbin.
BETULA
What about you, Stan?
STAN
Me?
BETULA
You’re a prominent local business owner now. You’re Head of Innovation, overseeing the transformation of the Axe and Crown.
STAN
Oh well, you know. I mean, sure, I try, but… thank you, thats—I don’t know anything about politics, so it’s…
GUBBIN
Stan doesn’t have the nerve for politics. I think of him as a soft little bunny man.
STAN
Okay…
GUBBIN
You put him in a debate against a throw pillow and I guarantee you, ten minutes in he’s gonna say, “Oh yeah, right, Mister Pillow! I didn’t see it that way before! I better take a nap.”
BETULA
Uncle.
GUBBIN
Am I wrong?
STAN
No no no, you’re not wrong. And I love pillows. They’re so nice.
GUBBIN
They are, aren’t they?
STAN
How about you, Betula? You’ve got more nerve than me, that’s for sure. And you follow goings-on in the neighbourhood, right?
BETULA
Well, I like to keep up to date, but politics isn’t really my wheelhouse either.
STAN
You’d be great, though! You’re down-to-earth, forthright, honest…
GUBBIN
(laughs)
STAN
I mean, how does this Braithwick guy keep getting elected? Is he just a real likeable guy?
GUBBIN
You kidding? Everyone hates his guts. His family employs a ton of people, but meanwhile he’s been trying to undermine the guilds for years.
BETULA
You’d think they’d be organizing against him.
GUBBIN
They are! But that’s where money talks. He’s got a million crowns from the shipping business and who knows how many other big companies lining his pockets. He can outspend his opponents a hundred to one.
BETULA
Really.
STAN
Yeah, running for office is expensive. There’s printing, signs, staffing…
GUBBIN
Paying off the right people at the Palace and Town Hall.
BETULA
And these companies are paying how much to finance him?
GUBBIN
Thousands. Tens of thousands. Not to mention all the wine and carriages and trips to Melluria…
BETULA
Nice work if you can get it. The question is, how to get it.
GUBBIN
Yeah. Wait, you’re not thinking of running, are you?
STAN
Why not? Betula could totally get in!
BETULA
I don’t know. I’d need a platform if I was gonna run.
STAN
Woo hoo!
BETULA
If.
GUBBIN
You’re actually considering it.
BETULA
Just hypothetically.
STAN
Hypothetical woo hoo!
GUBBIN
Hypothetically… start with cutting back property taxes, eh? Essie over on Anchor Street, she’s about to lose her deli ’cause she can’t keep up.
BETULA
These new places can afford to pay, though. Like the Badger and Bucket. Maybe anyone new who buys into the neighbourhood gets the new rate?
STAN
That is nice thinking! I like that.
Miss Betula, what about road safety? That’s a big thing in Constance’s plan. Do you have any proposals?
BETULA
Uh, like better street lighting?
STAN
Yeah. The number of times I’ve nearly broken my neck on those cobblestones…
GUBBIN
Or that one night you got both your boots stuck in the mud and came home barefoot?
STAN
Exactly. Not to mention all the muggings and the pickpocketing that goes on around here at night. We have got to do something about that.
BETULA
(guilty)
Yeah, definitely. Damn those thieves.
STAN
What else? What does Braithwick usually run on?
GUBBIN
Jobs.
BETULA
And?
GUBBIN
That’s it.
STAN
I guess that makes sense.
But how do we outdo him on that? “More jobs”? “Better jobs”? “Shinier jobs”?
GUBBIN
Well, when it comes to jobs, Betula’s got quite the track record. If you count the forgery, fencing and professional kleptomania.
STAN
Well…
BETULA
I think we’re talking about making jobs for other people, Uncle.
GUBBIN
Eh, you gotta help yourself before you can help anybody else, right? Heh heh. That’s my motto.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—A FEW DAYS LATER
Betula consults a piece of paper.
BETULA
So, it looks like we’ve got five candidates in the running. There’s me, Duffin Braithwick and three others. Vincenzo Funk wants tuition cuts and a freeze on swan boat fares.
GUBBIN
Aa, he’s just a kid. He’s not gonna be a threat this time.
BETULA
Grunelda Blank…
GUBBIN
(laughs)
Is she running again? Oh, good old Grunelda.
BETULA
Her platform seems to be pretty much down to “restrict the number of cats—”
BETULA AND GUBBIN
“—living in one house”.
GUBBIN
It’s basically a feud between her and her neighbour. She’s run for council about a dozen times.
BETULA
And finally, we got Jane Tolliveri. Schoolteacher, really focused on getting rid of corruption at Town Hall. So, potential danger there.
GUBBIN
Yeah. You’re taking this more seriously than I thought.
BETULA
Eh, it’s fun. It’s kind of like casing the joint before you break in and steal—
She stops herself as the door opens and Stan enters.
BETULA
Oh, hey Stan.
STAN
Hey guys! I got our posters printed up. Look at this.
He pulls out a big poster.
STAN
“Vote Betula!”
GUBBIN
(unimpressed)
Wow.
BETULA
Is that supposed to be me?
STAN
Yeah, well, we were in a hurry and you weren’t there to pose for the portrait, so I just described you.
GUBBIN
That explains why you’re wearing a suit.
STAN
I thought it would be good if you looked, y’know, kinda professional.
BETULA
I mean, it’s not a bad look.
GUBBIN
“Keep the South Side Affordable”. Hard to argue with that slogan.
BETULA
What am I holding?
STAN
A baby.
GUBBIN
(laughing)
That’s a baby? Why is it wearing a suit?
BETULA
Oh no. That’s supposed to be a troll baby, isn’t it?
STAN
Well, it didn’t seem right to put you on a poster holding someone else’s baby, so…
GUBBIN
(chuckling)
BETULA
And now everyone’s going to think I’m a mom.
STAN
I just thought holding a baby would make you seem more trustworthy and approachable.
BETULA
Stop laughing. Stop it.
Fine, if that’s what it takes.
GUBBIN
Yeah, it might “resonate” with the parents out there.
STAN
Yes. Exactly!
GUBBIN
Definitely the ones with really ugly kids.
BETULA
Yeah. Yeah. It looks a little like a tiny Gubbin.
GUBBIN
(still laughing)
Can’t be me, it’s wearing a suit.
STAN
Okay team! What do you say? Time to get out there and slap some posters on walls?
BETULA
There’ll be someone getting slapped, all right.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—LATER
The door opens and Gubbin, Betula and Stan enter from the street.
BETULA
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. This is all new to me. I didn’t realize the campaign was already on.
STAN
The campaign is always on, Betula!
BETULA
I mean, no one’s ever walked up to me and asked me point blank like that before.
GUBBIN
You sure surprised that guy, though. “How do we know you’re not a crook like all the rest?”
BETULA
Yeah. What was I supposed to do?
STAN
Well, tell him in glorious detail all about your exploits as a professional thief, apparently.
BETULA
You said the whole idea behind this campaign was honesty.
GUBBIN
An honest image. There’s a huge difference between that and actual honesty.
BETULA
So, lie and then lie about lying.
GUBBIN
As usual.
STAN
Oh man, I suddenly feel kinda sick to my stomach.
When did you steal an antique carriage full of jewels, anyway?
BETULA
Couple months ago. It was parked right outside the Palace, too.
STAN
Betula!
BETULA
Stan, I worked for a Meyurian gangster. I’ve done a lot more than steal a few things.
STAN
Oh geez, I don’t want to know this.
GUBBIN
Oh, it’s fine, Stan. You saw that guy. He was impressed.
STAN
Yeah, but if word gets out…
GUBBIN
We’ll be fine. We just gotta spin it the right way.
STAN
Spin it? Spin it how?
GUBBIN
Well, we’re in Ward Seven. It’s a rough neighbourhood. What percentage of the people out there haven’t been tempted to steal a little something now and then?
STAN
I think that you will find that most of our neighbours are honest, hard-working folks.
BETULA
Gubbin’s right. They’re also gonna understand the pressures someone faces living here, and that it may lead them to take on activities that are not on their face… legal.
GUBBIN
Well said. Well said, niece o’ mine.
STAN
(unconvinced)
I mean, I guess it shows initiative and… what could we say? It shows organization?
BETULA
Yes! Absolutely. It took six of us to pull off that carriage job, and it needed days of planning.
GUBBIN
Oh, that’s good, that’s good. A proven track record of management and leadership.
BETULA
A team player. But decisive.
STAN
I don’t like this any more.
BETULA
It’s okay, Stan. You don’t have to be out there doing the talking.
STAN
But talking is what I’m good at! Lying, not so much.
GUBBIN
Well then, just believe what we tell you, and repeat it to whoever you meet.
STAN
Oh boy.
GUBBIN
I’ll tell you, this is how we attract the big money to our campaign.
STAN
I’m gonna go see if the printer has our pamphlets ready yet.
He heads out.
GUBBIN
(sighs)
Ah, geez. What are we gonna do with that kid?
BETULA
He’ll be fine. Stan’s always fine. He just gets nervous when we try something new.
GUBBIN
Like tell the truth?
BETULA
(laughs)
Yeah. The look on that fella’s face.
GUBBIN
(laughing)
I actually thought his eyes might fall out.
BETULA
I am starting to like this running for office thing.
GUBBIN
It’s more fun than I thought.
Well, I believe I shall freshen up before the afternoon rush starts.
BETULA
All right. I’ll get these posters and things out of the way.
Gubbin heads upstairs and Betula sets to work.
The front door opens.
BETULA
Oh hey, we’re not open until 4:30.
STRANGER
Oh, I’m not looking for a drink. Are you Betula?
BETULA
Yeah. That’s me.
STRANGER
Forgive me. You don’t look exactly like your posters.
BETULA
Sure. Can I help you?
STRANGER
Yes, we’d like to talk about how we could assist you with your campaign.
BETULA
That’s awfully nice of you. When you say “we”—who exactly is that?
The stranger produces a business card.
STRANGER
Stuart Bathbridge. I represent Mysticorp Energy. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Betula.

The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 6: Back Room Deals.
INT. BAR—AFTERNOON
A boisterous after-work crowd. Gubbin is frantically filling tankards.
PATRON
Hey Gubbin! What happened to those beers?
GUBBIN
I’m comin’, I’m comin’, cool your jets!
Betula emerges from the back room.
BETULA
Hey Uncle. How’s it going out here?
GUBBIN
I’m moving my tushy off! Gosh. It’s Friday, and folks are thirsty.
BETULA
Yeah, sorry, I had an appointment.
GUBBIN
I saw. So, who’s this new friend of yours?
BETULA
Friend?
GUBBIN
That guy you were chatting with in the back room. Didn’t look like one of your usual contacts.
BETULA
True, Stuart kinda stands out around here, doesn’t he.
GUBBIN
Yeah, wearing a suit like that, I figure he’s either a fancy client, or someone with an interest in your election bid.
BETULA
Good guess. Yeah, we’ve met a couple of times. He’s been giving me some information on our incumbent.
GUBBIN
Oh yeah? Like how that little creep keeps getting elected?
BETULA
Exactly. Funny thing about Duffin Braithwick. A couple of challengers who ran against him ended up, you know…
GUBBIN
Slightly waterlogged, yeah.
SECOND PATRON
Another pint, my good man.
GUBBIN
Yep.
(back to Betula)
But that was years ago.
BETULA
Yeah. I guess the disappearances got a little too much attention from the press and the town guard. So Braithwick’s turned to other methods. These days it’s a lot of intimidation outside polling stations, and a little bit of magical ballot-stuffing.
GUBBIN
Hah! I knew it.
BETULA
Apparently he’s found a way of getting around all the safeguards.
GUBBIN
Here you go.
SECOND PATRON
Excellent.
GUBBIN
Sounds like something the press needs to hear about.
BETULA
Absolutely.
THIRD CUSTOMER
I’ll have another half-pint of the dark ale, please?
BETULA
Coming up!
She fills a tankard.
GUBBIN
You find all this out from your Mister Suit?
BETULA
A lot of it. Stuart’s been very helpful.
GUBBIN
What’s his deal, anyway? Sure didn’t look like Guild.
BETULA
No, he’s a rep for Mysticorp Energy.
GUBBIN
Oh, big new money. Hmm. So Mysticorp want Braithwick out, huh? Interesting. Wonder what he did to tick them off.
BETULA
Yeah, it’s not like he’s a competitor.
(to customer)
Here you go.
She slides the tankard over. Coins clink.
THIRD CUSTOMER
Thanks, Betula!
GUBBIN
So has “Stuart” said what he wants from you?
BETULA
No, I guess it’s just future consideration if I actually get on council.
GUBBIN
You gotta be careful what you promise.
BETULA
I haven’t promised anything.
GUBBIN
Has he promised you anything? Or has it all been just dirt on the opposition?
BETULA
Mostly dirt, but he did say he’s very keen to see Braithwick go down.
The door opens and Stan hurries in.
STAN
Hey! Guys! You’re not gonna believe this. Look!
GUBBIN
What’s this?
STAN
It’s a new pamphlet from Constance. You know Mysticorp, the big magical energy company?
BETULA
I… know of them.
STAN
Well, get this. They’re trying to run a transmission line for magical energy right through our ward!
BETULA
Is that a bad thing?
STAN
“Is that a bad thing?” Big time.
You think the potion dumping was dangerous—this is gonna run straight along the waterfront and under the Lookout Bridge, all the way to downtown. Anywhere they run these transmission lines, there’s earthquakes, there’s freak weather events, cats with opposable thumbs…
BETULA
Geez, that is scary.
STAN
Right? We’ve gotta put a stop to this project! Down with Mysticorp!
GUBBIN
Well, this just got interesting.
STAN
Oh, this is gonna be the issue that decides this election. They’re gonna be trying to influence the candidates to get this project pushed through. We must be vigilant.
BETULA
(awkward)
Sure.
INT BAR—MORNING
STAN
All right, team! Time to get on the old campaign trail.
BETULA
Thanks for doing this, Stan.
STAN
You bet! Brunch can wait. Democracy is way more important than mere peanut butter waffles.
GUBBIN
Yup, enjoy yourselves. Good luck pretending that meeting people is fun and worthwhile.
BETULA
You’re always a help, Uncle.
GUBBIN
I know you’re thinking it.
Stan brings out two bags.
STAN
Look, I got us matching satchels to hold all our brochures.
BETULA
Aw, thanks Stan.
(she tries one)
The strap’s a little short.
STAN
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Troll thing. I guess maybe you can sling it over one arm?
A sudden burst of cheering from outside.
GUBBIN
The hell’s going on out there?
BETULA
Some kind of street festival? They’re putting up a ton of banners.
STAN
They’re what?
He runs to the front door and opens it.
GUBBIN
Street festival?
(squints)
“A Taste of Mud Street”. Ha, of course. Look—sponsored by all the Bucket Pubs.
Stan returns.
STAN
All right, this is really the last straw!
GUBBIN
Yeah, I’m sick of the Badger and Bucket—it’s one public nuisance after another with them.
STAN
They organized this whole amazing festival and they didn’t tell us. Other places up and down the street are setting up tables and music stages.
GUBBIN
Argh! Always with the goddamn musicians!
Stan closes the door.
STAN
That Dorothea, she probably planned this for the weekend before election day because she knew we’d be campaigning. They’re gonna sell food all day and make a killing, and here’s us with nothing!
BETULA
I guess this is payback for those firecrackers we sent them disguised as candles?
GUBBIN
Aaa, let ’em have their stupid festival.
STAN
No no no no no, we can do this, we can do this. Hold on. I’m Head of Innovation. Let me think this through. We’re gonna… okay, we’re gonna move some tables outside, and we’re gonna figure out where to get some food at the last minute, we’re gonna…
Silence.
GUBBIN
Uh huh?
STAN
We’re gonna…
BETULA
Look like chumps.
STAN
Aw, man.
Wagon wheels outside. The front door swings open.
STAN
Hi there. Can I help you?
COURIER
(cheery Australian accent)
Yeah, I’m looking for a Betula Erfydsdottir?
BETULA
Yup, That’s me.
COURIER
Hi, I’m Crane! Where do you want us to set up these tables?
BETULA
Tables?
GUBBIN
Tables?
COURIER
Yeah, for the festival?
STAN
Tables?
BETULA
We didn’t order any tables…
COURIER
Oh, no, yeah, we got an order in to deliver two tents, plus tables, signage, a portable stove and all the groceries.
STAN
(looking out the door)
What the heck? Is this your wagon? Holy cow.
COURIER
Yeah! The rest of the crew should be here soon.
BETULA
What crew? Who sent you?
GUBBIN
How much is all this gonna cost us?
COURIER
Cost you? Nothing. This is already paid for. All sales go straight to you.
GUBBIN
What’s the catch?
COURIER
No catch. It’s all taken care of. Oh, there’s a note for you. Here.
Betula opens the note.
BETULA
“All the best for a successful Taste of Mud Street. Looking forward to working closely with you. Regards… Stuart.”
GUBBIN
Yeah, I had a feeling.
STAN
Sorry, Sutart? Who? Who?
COURIER
So, we’ve got five tables, so I’m thinking two on this side of the door, two on that side and one under the window for prep. We’re gonna be serving a stripped-down version of your existing menu: stew, mock pigeon pie, and two ales on tap. I’m just gonna head out and start setting up. Sound good?
STAN
Look, this is great. This all looks amazing, thank you so much—
COURIER
Yeah, you bet!
He closes the front door behind him.
STAN
Can we get back to the Stuart part? Who the heck is Stuart?
BETULA
Just a guy we’ve been meeting with—I’ve been meeting with. He’s been passing me information about Duffin Braithwick. Like that big scandal in the paper last week about how he was using animate ink to alter ballots. That was a tip from Stuart.
STAN
And now this “Stuart” is just suddenly sending us a ready-made booth for the street fair?
GUBBIN
And a whole team to run it? Betula, what exactly did you agree to?
BETULA
Nothing! I didn’t agree to anything! He didn’t tell me anything like this was happening.
GUBBIN
This is all straight out of some kinda fairy tale. Someone waved a magic wand and kapoof, we got a feast to sell all the visitors at the fair.
BETULA
I didn’t even know there was A Taste of Mud Street going on this weekend. None of us knew!
STAN
But this Stuart guy did, clearly. And made this all appear overnight.
GUBBIN
Like magic.
Wait a second. Stan, what was that plan you were warning us about? Some transmission line being built by Mysticorp?
STAN
Yeah, transmission line, yeah. I mean, what does that have to do with any of this?
GUBBIN
You said they’re running the lines through this neighbourhood?
STAN
Yeah?
GUBBIN
I bet you a whole wagonload of pigeon pies that they want to build something just this side of the bridge. Which is owned by Braithwick Shipping.
STAN
Yeah, but what does that have to do with us suddenly having food tents?
BETULA
The guy I met. Stuart. He’s with Mysticorp.
STAN
He’s what?
Mysticorp Energy paid for all this?
BETULA
Yeah!
GUBBIN
Well, that’s what the signs say.
STAN
The signs?! Wait—
(he looks out the door)
Oh no!
GUBBIN
“Mysticorp Energy wishes you a very happy Taste of Mud Street!”
BETULA
I mean, that’s pretty amazing.
STAN
Amazing? No, no, no, we can’t do this!
BETULA
Stan, they totally saved us! We would have had nothing this weekend. Everyone else on the block would have been making money hand over fist and we would have gotten nothing. Now we’ve got a whole team here to sell food for us.
STAN
No no no. No! Tell them we’re giving it back.
BETULA
The food’s already here. Do you want to waste it?
STAN
We can not promote them. They’re the bad guys.
BETULA
What’s the big deal? It’s not like people are really going to vote based on some stupid sign.
GUBBIN
And it looks like they made you some shiny new campaign buttons too.
BETULA
We’re not actually taking money from them.
STAN
We might as well be! Look, I may be the dumbest guy in town and even I know that Mysticorp is gonna want you to do their bidding. They want your support building this transmission line once you win.
BETULA
(laughs)
If we win. Gods help us if that actually happens.
STAN
What do you mean? That’s the whole point. We’re trying to win.
BETULA
Speak for yourself. I just signed on for the free stuff.
STAN
How can you say that? Is this just a game to you? What happens on council affects everyone in this city. And here’s you guys, laughing about taking money from Mysticorp.
BETULA
Well, what do you want me to do? Drop out of the race?
STAN
No, no, no! That’s handing Braithwick another term. We have a chance to make a difference in this city, guys!
GUBBIN
Kid, what difference are we really gonna make?
STAN
Well, none, if you’re gonna be like that. Listen to you two! Don’t you care about anyone but yourselves?
GUBBIN
Hey. Hey! I care about this place. I care about my regulars and my neighbourhood.
STAN
Really? Doesn’t seem that way to me. You’re always complaining about the neighbours. And your regulars. Because no one is ever good enough for you.
GUBBIN
Ouch.
BETULA
Look, Mysticorp is trying to help us take down a corrupt councillor.
STAN
That doesn’t make them saints.
BETULA
Yeah? Well, Stan, it doesn’t make them evil.
GUBBIN
You know what your problem is, Stan—you care too much.
STAN
Yeah? Maybe I do. But who do you think should run this city? People who care or people who don’t?
GUBBIN
You wanna please everybody, and for everybody to just get along, and that’s not reality.
STAN
Maybe not, but we can try to make it reality. We can try to get along.
GUBBIN
Some people are just wrong, Stan.
STAN
Yeah.
And right now, I think that’s you.
And I can’t be part of this.
He walks to the door.
GUBBIN
Suit yourself.
BETULA
No, Stan, come on. We’re just serving food outside for a weekend.
STAN
You’re not even serving the food.
Look, I can’t be here. I can’t be in the middle of all this. I’m gonna go work for someone who does care.
BETULA
Stan…
Stan closes the door. A moment later, it opens again.
COURIER
Hey, is it okay if we store the casks of ale inside?
(awkward pause)
Bad time. I’ll come back.
He closes the door.
INT. BAR—NIGHT
Music and celebration outside. Gubbin and Betula watch from inside.
BETULA
I gotta hand it to them. It all worked.
GUBBIN
The kids on our “street team” said they were up to four hundred crowns already.
BETULA
Wow. It really was a hell of a party. And they’re back at it again tomorrow.
GUBBIN
Yeah. You hand out a lot of campaign flyers?
BETULA
Hundreds. Had a few people interested in booking events here.
GUBBIN
Oh yeah?
BETULA
I overheard a woman raving about the stew, and I’m pretty sure she was a food writer for the Gazette.
GUBBIN
Well, her readers are in for a shock when they come and taste our regular food.
BETULA
Where did all those people come from today?
GUBBIN
With all their money.
BETULA
Yeah.
I mean, I’m not complaining.
GUBBIN
No, no, me neither.
Glum silence.
BETULA
I hope Stan’s doing okay.
GUBBIN
Yeah.
INT. CAFE—DAY
A busy cafe. The door opens with a jingle, and Stan walks up to where Betula is sitting.
STAN
(polite)
Hello, Betula.
BETULA
Stan! Hi. Uh, have a seat? Or I guess you order up there first.
STAN
No, I’m good for now.
BETULA
Yeah. Heh. Feel a little out of place here. But thanks for meeting me.
STAN
Yeah.
BETULA
So… congrats.
STAN
Yeah. You too. You won, that’s…
BETULA
I’m really glad Constance got in.
STAN
Thanks.
BETULA
Did you have a good party after the results came in?
STAN
Oh yeah. Constance gave a really great speech. It was very moving.
BETULA
Aw, that’s great. And you’re gonna be working at her office now, huh?
STAN
Yup. I get my own desk, business cards… it’s pretty sweet.
BETULA
Nice. Heh.
Look, I know we made some bad decisions in this campaign. You were right. We were flying high and didn’t realize what we were doing. I didn’t realize.
We made almost a thousand crowns over the weekend, but… I thought it should go to something more important. I want to donate it to… what’s the organization Constance runs? River Grand Grandmas?
STAN
Grandmas for the Grand. Yeah, that’s it.
That’s a thoughtful gesture, but no. Thank you.
BETULA
What? Think what you could do with that money!
STAN
Money from Mysticorp.
BETULA
It’s money from our weekend selling food at the Axe and Crown.
STAN
Which was all run and managed by Mysticorp. They were handing out buttons. There were sponsorship signs all over your tent. This is Mysticorp money. Betula, we can’t take it.
BETULA
But what am I supposed to do with it?
STAN
Fix the floors, buy new bar stools—why are you asking me?
BETULA
Stan. I’m out of my depth. I never thought I’d actually win.
STAN
Seems like you’re better at this than you thought, huh?
BETULA
Yeah. But… I’m lost.
STAN
Betula, I cut you a lot of slack, you know? All this time, I’ve been looking the other way when people come to you to fence whatever thing they stole—
BETULA
Stan! Shh! Geez.
STAN
Actually, no, I’m not gonna “shh”.
Look, maybe underneath all the stealing and the lying and the sabotaging your competition, maybe underneath that there’s still a good troll with a heart of gold. Or maybe not. I honestly can’t tell any more.
But I want to believe that you can stand up for all those people who voted for you. And you’re not just gonna line your own pockets, or shill for a huge energy company.
BETULA
I won’t. I never signed anything, I never promised them anything. I don’t have to do what they say.
STAN
Yeah. I guess we’ll see.
BETULA
I want to make this right.
STAN
I want to believe you, Betula. I really—I honestly do. I don’t know if I can yet.
BETULA
That’s fair.
STAN
So.
I’m gonna see you at town hall.
BETULA
Yeah, see you there.
STAN
See you there.
Stan walks slowly out.

A Fable and Folly Production."
"Bonus: A Dangerous Cocktail","ELI
Hi everyone! Hope you’re well out there.
It’s Eli here, and we thought it was time to open up the vaults again and release a few of our favourite Patreon bonuses from the past little while.
This one’s an Axe and Crown special inspired by… okay, I mean you’ve heard podcasts, right? You might recognize the inspiration for this one. It’s called “A Dangerous Cocktail”.
Music sting.
THE BAR
Stan tears open an envelope.
STAN
Hey Gubbin, we should really go through the mail more often.
GUBBIN
Yeah, like I need more bills.
STAN
Well yeah, there are a lot of those. But every envelope holds a chance of something special.
Hey, look, a flyer!
GUBBIN
Ooo! Not just mail, but junk mail! Excuse me while I contain my excitement.
STAN
Actually, this sounds pretty cool. Pestle and Mix: A cocktail subscription service.
GUBBIN
A what?
STAN
Look at this! They send you a box of cocktail supplies every month.
GUBBIN
Cocktails, schmocktails. This is a bar, not some cutesy little North Side night club.
STAN
Hey, bars can serve cocktails. Hello? People like to try new things, you know—get out of their comfort zone and live a little?
GUBBIN
Well, this here barkeep is quite comfortable in his comfort zone. That’s why it’s called a comfort zone, and he’s in it. Thank you very much.
STAN
You know the Blue Pantaloons by the Palace? They have an artist on staff who will sketch your cocktail before you drink it.
GUBBIN
Why would anyone want a picture of their drink?
STAN
You share it with your friends, so they see how amazingly perfect your life is.
BETULA
What are you two up to?
GUBBIN
Starting to doubt humanity again…
STAN
Betula, you talk to him.
BETULA
About?
STAN
Let’s put some cocktail drinks on the menu. Jazz things up a little bit.
GUBBIN
No. What the hell is “jazz”? No. Just no.
STAN
Fine. I’m sorry I brought it up. I’ll just throw this away.
He starts to crumple up the flyer.
BETULA
No, no, let’s see that.
“Three new recipes every month from Farloria’s top bartenders.”
STAN
They send you a box with all the ingredients. We just add the alcohol.
GUBBIN
What’s wrong with just drinking the alcohol we already have?
STAN
This is about the experience. A night out wearing your very best, laughing and jibing with your college buddies. As if the whole town was your oyster!
GUBBIN
Yeah. The last thing we need is a bunch of entitled, loudmouth whelps running around my bar, puking on my floor because they can’t keep their oysters down.
STAN
Come on, Gubbin. Here, look. Look at this one. Doesn’t that look tasty?
GUBBIN
Ugh. I drink my alcohol like a real troll, thank you.
BETULA
You know, maybe Stan’s on to something. Cocktail culture is big in Melluria, and now it’s starting to show up here. I hear there’s even a cocktail bar back in Trølsund.
GUBBIN
Ugh. Now I really don’t need to go back.
BETULA
I think it’s called De Appel Tvig.
STAN
You see, Gubbin? We need to jump on this bandwagon before it sails!
GUBBIN
I don’t know if you two have looked around lately, but this ain’t exactly a high-end Palace Street establishment. Who the hell do you think is gonna come here to the Axe and Crown for cocktails?
STAN
No, listen! The down-and-out vibe is totally in. Slumming it, diving in, living life like a Mellurian artiste—starving, yet sophisticated.
GUBBIN
Stop.
BETULA
I’m not saying this is gonna work. But the city crowd would bring pretty fat wallets.
Silence.
GUBBIN
Okay, I’m listening.
STAN
So this Pestle and Mix service gives us the recipes. All we need are the cocktail glasses!
BETULA
And maybe we could all take a bath and dress up a little?
STAN
Yeah, all of us.
GUBBIN
Why are you all looking at me?
(scoffs)
Can you picture me in a suit and tie?
STAN
C’mon. What do you say, Gubbin?
GUBBIN
Ugh. You guys are exhausting. All right, all right. How much is this cocktail box going to run us, anyway?
STAN
Here.
GUBBIN
WHAT?
(he snatches the flyer from Stan)
40 crowns! Are you insane? Your hoity-toity bourgeois clowns can just sip unadulterated ale out of big person glasses like the rest of us!
STAN
But that’s not really—
BETULA
Stan, how much do these cocktails go for? By the glass?
STAN
I dunno, last time I was at the Blue Pantaloons, I think it was about eight crowns per drink?
GUBBIN
Eight crowns.
STAN
Maybe nine? I dunno. It’s a bit hazy. Those drinks go down pretty easy, ha ha.
Long pause.
GUBBIN
Let’s get one thing straight. We’re not spending 40 crowns.
STAN
The recipes are sort of important.
GUBBIN
Then you two geniuses can get creative and come up with your own recipes.
STAN
Woo hoo! Signature Axe and Crown cocktails!
GUBBIN
Yeah, whatever. Just don’t kill my patrons, okay?
Music sting.
A FEW DAYS LATER
Stan enters carrying a box of cocktail glasses.
GUBBIN
Hey Stan.
STAN
Hey guys! Look! The new cocktail glasses are ready. I had them put axes on half and crowns on the other half.
He sets the box on the bar and opens it. Gubbin picks up a glass.
GUBBIN
People drink out of these little things? You can’t even fit a single shot in here.
STAN
Ah, let me educate you, my friend. The glasses are shaped to expose the liquid to the air so you get the full aromatic experience.
GUBBIN
I feel like an idiot just holding it.
The glass in his hand shatters delicately.
STAN
Gubbin!
GUBBIN
I barely touched it!
Betula enters with groceries in a basket.
BETULA
Ooo. Nice glasses.
STAN
Aren’t they cool?
GUBBIN
(grunts)
If they last the night. How are you two coming along with those recipes?
STAN
We’re still experimenting a little, but…
Betula hoists the basket of goods behind the bar.
BETULA
We’ve got a couple promising ones. Now move aside.
GUBBIN
It’s my bar.
BETULA
Not when I’m making the drinks, it isn’t. No. Go. Uncle. Sit. Sit at the bar and behave.
GUBBIN
Fine.
He trudges around the bar and has a seat.
BETULA
Now, this is a work in progress, but I think you’re gonna like it.
Betula pulls down a bottle from the top shelf and sets about mixing a drink.
GUBBIN
Hey, that’s the good stuff!
BETULA
Yup. Plus pomegranate juice and a quick shake… And just three sprigs of burning juniper.
GUBBIN
What? I said no burning stuff!
BETULA
Relax. It’s not literally burning, that’s just what the plant’s called. It’s a garnish.
GUBBIN
Why anyone would doctor perfectly good spirits is beyond me.
STAN
Look, it’s all about…
STAN AND BETULA
…the experience.
BETULA
Here. Just try it, Uncle.
I’m calling it a “Red Kraken”.
GUBBIN
You’ve tainted perfectly good alcohol is what you’ve done.
He takes a noisy sip.
STAN
And?
He downs the rest.
GUBBIN
That is… not bad.
BETULA
He says, after drinking it all in one go.
GUBBIN
Okay, okay. It’s, uh, pretty tasty.
BETULA
Right?
STAN
Woo hoo! Okay, my turn! My turn!
He pushes his way behind the bar and gets to work.
STAN
Okay, watch this. I just need this glass here… thank you… Let’s see, shot of gin.
BETULA
Ow… wait. Stan! Stan, you are making a mess.
STAN
I’m on a roll, let me work. Just gotta squeeze a bit of crangerine into there…
BETULA
You’re standing on my foot. Is that an egg?
STAN
Yup, sure, the egg goes in there, and then we shake-shake-shake-shake-shake, yeah, give it a good little shake, there we go, and…
Stan pours, and sets the shaker down triumphantly.
STAN
Tada!
GUBBIN
What is this?
STAN
I call this a Moonshine Fizz.
The drink fizzes and goes on fizzing.
GUBBIN
Is it supposed to be frothing all over my bar?
STAN
Still perfecting the ratios.
GUBBIN
Uh huh. Betula, would you care to…?
BETULA
Nope. All you, Uncle.
GUBBIN
(deep breath)
Okay. Here goes.
STAN
Wait! Hold on! You can’t just drink it.
GUBBIN
What am I supposed to do with it? Let it fizz all over me?
STAN
(sighs)
You have to smell it first. Breathe in the aromas and textures by waving it into your nose and taking deep breaths like this. Just bring it up to—
(he tries and breaks into a coughing fit)
GUBBIN
Or I could just drink it.
Gubbin downs it in one go.
STAN
(still coughing)
…the… experience…
BETULA
So?
GUBBIN
It’s drinkable.
STAN
…told you…
GUBBIN
Why’s there gotta be egg in it, though?
STAN
(coughing)
Gives it body.
GUBBIN
Eh. Look. These taste fine. But we can do better.
BETULA
Oh, you think so?
GUBBIN
I do. Step aside.
BETULA
(laughing)
All right. This I gotta see.
They trade places.
GUBBIN
You’re getting stuck on all these expensive ingredients, eggs and crangerine and burning whatever-the-hells… You gotta think simpler. You gotta think profit margin.
He pours from two flasks at once into a glass.
BETULA
My mouth is watering already.
GUBBIN
All right, just a little bit of this… I’m gonna wave this over here, I’m gonna infuse it like this, I’m gonna put a little foam on it like this… dah dah da da… Ha ha!
I give you the newest Mud Street sensation! I call it “Dram Lake”.
He pushes the glass across the bar.
STAN
(recovering)
I’m afraid.
BETULA
Hit me.
Betula takes a sip. Then another.
GUBBIN
How’s that?
BETULA
It tastes like cheap whiskey that’s been mixed with… river water?
GUBBIN
Ya got it in one. Simple. Honest. Clean!
STAN
Is that safe?
GUBBIN
That’s goblin moonshine. Anything it doesn’t kill deserves to live. And at six crowns a drink, we’re going to be able to buy a title and land.
BETULA
Well then, your lordship… add in a garnish and I think you have something. Maybe some fish scales and mud on the rim?
GUBBIN
Sure, if you really gotta make it fancy.
(clutches his stomach)
Ugh!
An ominous gurgling sound.
BETULA
Okay, we can keep it “neat” if you prefer.
GUBBIN
(groans)
STAN
You’re looking a little bluer than normal there, Gub.
BETULA
Uncle?
The gurgling turns into a bubbling roar.
GUBBIN
(gasps and reaches out to support himself)
What… what did you put in those drinks? Hnnngh!
BETULA
Oh no. He’s going to blow! Get down!
GUBBIN
Oh no, the other end! AAAAArrgh!
INT. BAR—LATER
Dripping sounds.
Stan and Betula are cleaning up the bar and trying not to vomit.
STAN
Oh gods… there’s more behind the bottles!
BETULA
(groans)
STAN
It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t… for all the different colours… and the smell…
BETULA
No, no, stop.
Oh, there’s some in the cash register. No. I have to take a break.
She sits down heavily.
STAN
He’s gonna be okay, though, right?
BETULA
Yeah. Alba said for him to just get lots of fluids and to stay in the bathroom until it’s done… you know, passing.
Gubbin staggers back in.
STAN
Hey, Gubbin. Gubbin. Should you really be in here?
GUBBIN
It’s my bar. I’ll damn well go where I please.
BETULA
Yeah, you proved that point.
GUBBIN
Har har har.
STAN
Look, I’m so sorry, guys. This was all my idea. And I’m pretty sure that egg was off.
BETULA
No, no, some trolls are allergic to burning juniper, it turns out. To say nothing of the river water.
GUBBIN
We all had a part to play in this.
STAN
Yeah.
I’m gonna put the glasses in the basement and we can just put this all behind us.
GUBBIN
Why? We’re not giving up.
STAN
What?
GUBBIN
You wanna make money, we gotta take some risks.
STAN
Yeah, but…
GUBBIN
You learn from those risks and the mistakes and move forward.
STAN
Really? You mean it?
GUBBIN
Sure.
STAN
‘Cause I have this amazing idea for a cocktail that you light on fire.
GUBBIN
Stan…
STAN
Look, look. Ye Olde Pointed Hatte has these “Spirits” nights where these two cool librarian ladies talk about mythology and mix all kinds of wild new drinks—including flaming ones. I just haven’t worked out how to put the flames out so people can drink it.
GUBBIN
I said, no burning down my bar!
BETULA
Maybe it would be a good idea if we just got a subscription from Pestle and Mix.
GUBBIN
(sighs)
Ugh. Yeah, okay Fine. there should be 40 crowns in the till.
BETULA
Uh-uh.
GUBBIN
What?
BETULA
About the till…
GUBBIN
What about the till.
He looks.
GUBBIN
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

There are 40 towns in Melluria! I know that from my Geography class!

"Bonus Episode: The Axe & Crown S2 — Drubbin Drops In","ELI
Hi everyone! It’s Eli here with a bonus scene from The Axe & Crown. This one was originally a Patreon bonus from Season 2, but we thought we’d share it with the world this week. It’s called “Drubbin Drops In”. Sean thought of the original idea, and then we shipped it over to Marisa, who actually wrote this episode. We laughed a lot during the recording of this episode, which you’ll hear after the credits. Enjoy.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—DAY
The door opens and heavy footsteps enter.
STAN
Oh hey, Gubbin! Hey, I thought you were going for your mud bath.
There’s only a grunt in reply.
STAN
But while you’re here, check this out! You know how I’m always looking for a little something extra to set us apart from the other brunch places? And here it is. You ready?
Look at these: hibiscus centerpieces! No, I know what you’re thinking. “Hibiscu-what? Sounds like something a centaur hacked up.” No no no. But here’s the kicker. (Hibiscuses? How do you pluralize that? Hibiscum? Hibisceus? Hibiscussesses? Hib… anyway.) They’re edible, see. That’s the point I’m getting to. So, there they are in the middle of the table, looking all nice and pretty, and then all of a sudden, boom! Our customers can just grab a flower to season their dishes whenever they like! Hibiscus pancakes, hibiscus omelettes, hibiscus for both dining and delighting. It’s a festival of hibiscus! It’s a hivestival! Huh? Huh? Pretty good, huh? Right? Gubbin?
DRUBBIN
(very similar to Gubbin, but with a more hoity-toity accent)
Do I look like Gubbin to you?
STAN
Well, I wasn’t gonna say, but you’re maybe a little more… craggy today? Rugged, rugged, that’s a better word. Craggy’s a bad word. But still the same old Gubbin. Why? Did you do something? Oh my gosh you did something and I didn’t notice. I’m such a bad friend. Is it your hair? Did you get a haircut, you sassy boy? Did you—wait, I know what it is, it’s the mudbath! It’s given you that certain special glow!
DRUBBIN
I’m not Gubbin.
STAN
That’s funny, Gub! “I’m not Gubbin.” Hey! “I’m not Stan. Whoa! You’re not Gubbin and I’m not Stan.”
(laughs, then stops)
Wait, wait. Are you having another existential crisis? Gub, what’s going on? Are you feeling all disconnected again? Like the universe is so vast that one big ol’ troll running a bar can’t possibly mean anything to anyone?
DRUBBIN
I’m not Gubbin. I’m his brother.
STAN
(really relishing the part of therapist)
You know what, I hear ya. I hear ya. I’m feeling what you’re giving me right now. I’m doing this. You’re lost in a bit of a troll spiral, I’ve read about these. Sometimes, we all feel like our own brother, don’t we? Like we have to step outside ourselves to really know ourselves.
DRUBBIN
(sighs)
You are exasperating, small man. I am not Gubbin. Are you simple in the head?
STAN
Yes… simple! Just like good old Mud street. That’s what you love about me!
DRUBBIN
Is there anyone else here I can talk to?
STAN
Hey, you can always talk to me. You know that.
(head on Drubbin’s chest)
Are you in there, Gub? It’s me, Stan. Now open up. Let ol’ Stanny in.
DRUBBIN
Get your head off me.
GUBBIN! Hey Gubbin… are you in here someplace?
STAN
Oh, he’s in there someplace. Don’t forget that You just have to look deep inside, Gub. Right here in the ol’ heartbox.
(tapping him on the chest)
You’re feeling a little rough there. Mud bath must have missed a little spot.
DRUBBIN
Ugh, saints preserve me.
GUBBIN!!
Gubbin stomps down the stairs barefoot.
GUBBIN
What the hell’s going on down here? I’m halfway to mudtopia and suddenly I hear all this screaming.
STAN
Oh, Gubbin! Sorry, we didn’t mean to… wait a min… what… hold on, what’s… oh man!
DRUBBIN
Finally, the penny drops!
GUBBIN
Drubbin!
DRUBBIN
Damn right it’s me.
They hug with much slapping of backs.
GUBBIN
What in the craggy cliffs of Klomar are you doing here?!
STAN
Wait—Drub… what… someone help me, please…
GUBBIN
I see you’ve already met Stan.
DRUBBIN
Yeah, the… the charity case?
GUBBIN
Ha! Yeah, that’s him. The landlord here, believe it or not.
STAN
Hey, now. Neither one of you is being nice to me.
DRUBBIN
He thought I was YOU!
GUBBIN
WHAT?!!
They both cackle uproariously.
STAN
No, no! I thought it was a pretty understandable mistake.
GUBBIN
We look completely different.
DRUBBIN
Exactly!
GUBBIN
I’m the bluey-grey one.
DRUBBIN
And I’m the grey-blue one.
GUBBIN
Different as night and day!
STAN
You look exactly the same. I mean, aside from the mud and the towel.
Betula rushes out of the kitchen.
BETULA
Hey Stan… did a seagull just fly through here?
DRUBBIN
Anna Betula?
BETULA
Onkel Drubbin! Vat yu is du heer?
DRUBBIN
De same bak at yu.
STAN
(whispering to Betula)
Quick… point to the one you think is Gubbin.
BETULA
The one I think is Gubbin?
GUBBIN
Stan can’t tell us apart.
BETULA
Really? They’re like Gromskeigel and Shivsmargron. Completely different.
STAN
Uh yes… Groms and Shivsmumble… those guys.
BETULA
Mythical brothers who fought the Skolkraggar—never mind.
STAN
Well, they definitely look like brothers… like twin brothers.
BETULA
(scoffs)
Humans don’t have very good eyesight.
DRUBBIN
Anna Betula! I did not expect to find you here too.
BETULA
It’s a long story, but this is where I ended up. I’m helping run this place now, along with Gubbin and Stan.
DRUBBIN
Stan is the little one?
BETULA
Yes.
STAN
Hi!
DRUBBIN
This little silly one?
BETULA
Uh-huh.
STAN
Heh. Hi. Me. Silly. Little.
DRUBBIN
Well, now I’ve seen everything.
GUBBIN
Never mind the human kid. Grab a stool. What are you drinking?
DRUBBIN
Ah?
A calculating silence as they stare at each other.
GUBBIN
Holspirinki Vodka, eh?
DRUBBIN
Yeah! You remember.
Gubbin fetches a bottle and a glass and pours.
GUBBIN
Course I do. Gods. How long has it been?
DRUBBIN
Too long.
(he drinks)
BETULA
I remember Mama telling me you were off to Gnomensland just because no troll had ever been and you were gonna be the first!
DRUBBIN
And I was, Anni-bet!
BETULA
What’s it like there?
DRUBBIN
Oh! A magical place… the Gnomish culture was a breath of fresh air after the cloistered coves of Dromsfjord.
BETULA
Really? I heard gnomes are pretty suspicious.
DRUBBIN
Well, it helps if you learn to speak their language.
GUBBIN
So if you were living it up in far-off Gnomensland, what brings you to this dump?
DRUBBIN
I am here… to seek my fortune!
GUBBIN
I feel like I should repeat that question.
DRUBBIN
I finally found something I excelled at.
GUBBIN
So there is something you’re good at.
DRUBBIN
(laughs)
Yes, after many years there, I learned the craft of their map-making.
STAN
You know how to make a GPS?
GUBBIN
(scoffs)
I never met a Gnome who’d give away his beer order, never mind the secrets of his ancient craft.
STAN
Wow. What about clockwork?
DRUBBIN
Oh, no, no, no, their clockwork is bonkers. No one can learn that.
STAN
Aww.
DRUBBIN
I learned to construct automated maps in the manner of the gnomes of ancient times. I come to you now with the finest Place Seekers this side of the Northern Mountains.
I’m not allowed to call it a Gnomish Place Seeker, for obvious reasons. But they’re just as accurate, and at a much more affordable price.
He brings out a bag and pulls out some pages.
BETULA
Wow. I thought I’d seen some deluxe Place Seekers, but these are something else. Is that gold ink?
DRUBBIN
Precisely. The blue is lapis lazuli. And that warm wash is crushed topaz.
GUBBIN
You made these?
DRUBBIN
Of course I did. I just told you.
GUBBIN
You were always the idea guy, never the “pick up a tool and make something with your hands” kinda guy.
DRUBBIN
Pshaw!
Tell me, Anna Betula, what’s the best place in town to sell my wares? Is there a good market where I can set up a stall?
BETULA
I can definitely help you Uncle. I have some… special connections.
DRUBBIN
Ho ho! Huzzah. That’s my niece.
A soft chiming sound. Paper rustles. Stan is peering at one of the Place Seekers.
STAN
Hey Drubbin? Sorry… Drubbin? No, wait, you, you’re Drubbin, right?
GUBBIN
Stan, I’m wearing a towel. How difficult is this? Come on.
STAN
Right! Hey, Drubbin. What’s this little glowing mark on the bottom?
DRUBBIN
What mark? Give me that.
He snatches the map from Stan.
BETULA
I’ve never seen a GPS do that before.
DRUBBIN
It must be some kind of reaction from the ink. Is there something strange about this building? Or the river?
STAN
Could be the mud. I’ve always said Mud Street mud is special.
A precise knock at the door.
GUBBIN
Oh great. This one of yours, Betula?
BETULA
No, it’s the front door and that wasn’t my knock.
The knock again.
GUBBIN
Go away! We’re closed!
DRUBBIN
I recognize that knock.
STAN
I’ll get it.
DRUBBIN
Like… clockwork.
EXT. STREET—CONTINUOUS
The knocking continues.
Stan opens the door.
STAN
Oh my gosh, you are a gnome! Hey there!
KLINKAPLONKFELIX
Well met, good sir. My Place Seeker tells me that this is the place I seek.
STAN
Ooohhhh… you have a glowy thing too.
KLINK
I have. It has brought me very far and very quickly. I wish to let a room in your fine tavern.
STAN
Of course. You must have heard about our brunch!
KLINK
I am in search of my Gnomish Place Seekers.
STAN
There’s one in your hand.
KLINK
No, I mean my other Place Seekers. My prized collection, crafted by the hands of my ancestors and passed along to me down through the ages.
STAN
Oh, really? Are they as good as my friend Drubbin’s, though? ‘Cause his are pretty damn good.
KLINK
Did you say… Drubbin?
Gubbin appears at the door.
GUBBIN
All right, what’s going on out here?
KLINK
YOU!
Something shoots out on a spring and zaps Gubbin repeatedly.
GUBBIN
Aaaargggh!! What the hell was that?!! Ouch! Stop doing that.
KLINK
I will stop when you give back what you have taken from me.
GUBBIN
I didn’t take—ow! You angry little man!
KLINK
I will listen to no more of your lies, Drubbin of Dromsfjord!
GUBBIN
Drubbin…
KLINK
A name that Gnomensland will not soon forget.
GUBBIN
Will you people get it through your skulls? I’m not Drubbin. Ow! Oooh! Oooh!
Look, this is all a mistake. Drubbin! Where is that… Drubbin! Come here!
BETULA
He’s gone. Ran out the back door.
GUBBIN
What?!
BETULA
And he took his fancy Place Seekers with him. Hey, who’s this garden ornament?
KLINK
Drubbin of Dromsfjord, you will come with me and face the High Gnomish Tribunal.
GUBBIN
I’m not Drubbin! Aaaaah!! Get him away! Get him away!
STAN
Oh geez. He dropped the towel.
Now I’m never gonna be able to tell them apart.
Closing theme plays.

OUTTAKE 1
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I come to you now with the finest Palace Seekers this side of the Northern Mountains!
Laughter.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I’m not allowed to call it a—
(breaks character, laughs)
Would you stop laughing?
ART CARLSON
(laughing)
It’s a Place Seeker! It’s not a Palace Seeker! It can only f—-ing find palaces! It’s a Place Seeker!
MARISA KING
(giggling)
Oh my God, I can’t stop.
ART CARLSON
“We can only find palaces with these things. They have a very limited appeal. But still, if you need to find a palace, this thing’s gonna do the job for you.” “What about Place Seekers?” “I do not make those. There is no way in hell. That’s just too broad a spectrum. Palaces, this’ll get ya. I’m working on Fortress Seekers for next week.”
MARISA KING
Oh my God. I wish we were writing that.
“If you’re a princess, this is what you need!”
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Okay, here we go.
(back in character as Drubbin)
I mean, little girls would want a Palace Seeker. For gods’ sakes! I know my little girls would want one.
Laughter.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
No, no, I learned—no, no, their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that.
The entire cast and crew in fits of helpless laughter.
HUGO JONES
Is it the accent?
ELI
It’s a gestalt. It’s everything at once.
SEAN
It’s a good time.
HUGO JONES
All right! Here we go! I’m coming in hot! Coming in hot!
More laughter.
OUTTAKE 2
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I come to you now with the finest Plaaaice Seekers this side of the Northern Mountains.
Laughter.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
…Seekers.
ART CARLSON
“Playice Seekers”?
OUTTAKE 3
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I’m not allowed to call it a Gnomish Palace Seeker…
(laughs)
SEAN
Take it again.
HUGO JONES
I will! I’m…
(babbling)
OUTTAKE 4
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Wow. What about clockwork?
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Oh no no, their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that!
Laughter.
ART CARLSON
Boinkers?
ELI
(laughing)
I’m sorry.
MARISA KING
I know, we’re all a little losing it.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
No, no! Their clockwork is boink—
(laughs, breaks character)
That’s right. Now you’ve got me…
Sorry. I’m back!
(deep breath)
No, no, no! Their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that!
Laughter.
MARISA KING
Oh no, we’ve got the giggles.
ART CARLSON
All right! One more time. Here we go.
OUTTAKE 5
Laughter verging on exhaustion.
MARISA KING
Sorry…
SEAN
I’m sorry, I want more Drubbin. We’re writing Drubbin into more scripts.
ART CARLSON
No, it’s “bjoinkers”. It’s been Swede-ified.
ELI
I love that yeah, it’s B‑J-O…
ART CARLSON
Ahh. Nothing makes things funnier than a diphthong. Okay.
Gales of laughter.
MARISA KING
All right.
That was great.
SEAN
Everyone breathe. Everyone circle breathe.
The cast take deep breaths.
Music sting.
