[Applause]

I wish I could have been I I was

invisible I forgot I was invisible and I

took a selfie and I realize just

[Music]

[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action all right

most of us are still recovering from

twitchcon yeah tonight can I say

something about twitchcon really quick

yes the recording thing okay so as the

default representative of twitch for the

dice camera action community I want to

apologize on behalf of twitch everyone

has been tweeting me asking where that

recording is because I thought it

existed and I said I would go after it I

have been going after it for the last

couple days since twitchcon the truth is

that that recording that was supposed to

exist does not exist so we have lost the

first half as I understand it of the

episode the only video that's available

is the one that went out on the stream

that's on the vods of slashed represents

the reason that happened is a piece of

technology failed the contractor who set

up that piece of technology set up set

it up in properly so it killed both the

recording and the live stream at the

same time which wasn't supposed to

happen so I'm really really sorry I'm

really frustrated and rest assured that

it is being dealt with and I'm sorry so

but I hear that people have

reconstructed the story on the subreddit

so thank you cuz our community is

amazing that's cool

yeah so 1665 will be the half lost

episode it was this it was an exclusive

special edition episode that you could

only get at twitchcon for at least the

first half was so just to give a

detailed recap for the benefit of those

who could not continue twitchcon Ross

and Jeff were extremely funny twenties

yes Ross rolled to 20 in his first role

he rolled the 20 on his last role and

a little bit so what happened was the

waffle crew with their half-orc priest

of Torm umbral and her goblin steward

chumba went up river in their canoes and

then suddenly the spear came out of

nowhere

pierced the canoe with a nap twenty

pierced specifically D F and p-- Alton's

canoe and sank it only later was it

revealed after much failed searching

that the hurler of the spear was none

other than jumba's long-lost brother

Wamba a goblin warlock and with Wamba

and Chamba newly reunited and Umbriel

casting amending on the sunken canoe the

waffle crew continued upriver until they

got to a Riverside encampment that was

abandoned by the order of the gauntlet

Ambrose order and a search of this place

found all of these dead ghoul carcasses

with flies swarming over them and you

also found a bunch of graves that the

Knights had dug for their fallen

brethren with poles sticking out of them

and gauntlets on top of the polls and

paltin deciding that he didn't really

want anything to do at this place

immediately put up his waffle hut and

spent the rest of the episode

comfortably sequestered inside his

semi-opaque dome of happiness with simon

his trusty companion by his side and I'm

going to assume that paltin was doing

some in addition to just playing his

mandolin was doing a little bit of craft

work and fixing some straps on Simon and

attaching a keg to him so he could have

his walking keg back meanwhile Diaz

discovered that tucked away at the back

of the encampment built into a large

Hill covered with vines was an 80-foot

tall statue and there was so much

vegetation over it was a little hard to

discern but you made out

that the statue depicted a stylized man

with a crocodile on his back and that's

when Wamba regaled you with a tail he

heard about man and crocodile and for

the benefits of those who weren't at the

show this probably bears repeating so

bear with me it's still good to hear

even if you did hear it was a good story

yep I love story time days of the world

man stood by the banks of a river

frightened crocodile raised his head

from the water and asked what troubles

you cousin man man said I must cross

this river but I fear to enter the water

alone because it teams with your

brethren crocodile replied it's true you

would not be safe but I will carry you

across the river safely on my back if

you promise to return the favor man

agreed and crocodile bore him safely

across the water when they reached the

far bank man asked how can I repay you

crocodile replied I wish to see the

realm of humans but I fear to go there

alone because of teams with your

brethren you must carry me on your back

across your realm man had been tricked

but a promise is a promise so he carried

crocodile safely on his back across the

entire realm of humans a journey that

lasted many years he also swore in his

anger that never again would men and

crocodiles be friends and so it has

remained to this day and after telling

this story Strix noticed that there was

a pen an animal pen off on one end of

the camp with a little bird running

around inside it so he freed the little

bird which turned out to be a baby axe

beak and it went running off into the

jungle and evylyn chased after it

falling into a trap laid by some goblins

from a rival tribe a net fell upon

evylyn then Strix went in on her broom

after evalin and a net fell on her and

suddenly they were both trapped under

nets by these goblins who were

standing on each other's shoulders like

walking totem poles eventually the rest

of the party songs paltin converged on

this location and DF was able to slash

one of the nets open with gutter and I

don't remember what happened to the

other net but suffice to say the waffle

crew got out and chumba either a number

or driving back up to there she was

complaining right

yes but Samba and Wamba seeing goblins

from a rival tribe decided rather than

make war let's form an alliance and so

they talked to these goblins into having

Strix for dinner and the other tribe was

cool with this but evylyn strangely was

not and she tackled one of these totem

poles of goblins knocking the bottom

goblin out so the whole totem pole was

fall down in a pile thus needed the

diplomatic negotiations Strix set off a

fireball incinerating the rest of the

goblins and the little bird micro of

course the bird said never again Chris

now I know the trick yes and now and

after that crestfallen Strix handed the

cooked bird two waffles who ate it and

it was delicious

and it was awesome and no more bird then

evylyn thought up into the air because

the fireball seemed to have set off

earth tremors and she wanted to know

where they were coming from and it turns

out those tremors are being made by a

undead Tyrannosaurus Rex drawn to a

Haitian by the blast and the big fire

and oh gosh you tried to talk to the

creature but your animal friendship

spell did not have any effect on it

because it was Undead and so it's

stomped after your friends and then

Strix turned it into a chicken with a

polymorph spell but chumba mistaking

dragon base

sent for a call to attack went and

struck the the bird and it turned back

into a t-rex which then swallowed chumba

then Wamba who was invisible at the time

decided to cling on to the dinosaurs leg

and tried to stab it and then he folded

up a little paper airplane of the will

that he had made and shot it over to DF

and it just landed landed in deaths

lapel and then oh let's see

long story short the dinosaur was killed

by another fireball after a number of

people did damage to it and whacked on

an evil and got her shots in oh I forgot

to mention Strix made evil and super

enlarged ten-foot-tall

evil and was whacking into this t-rex

how little evil it is that's kind of a

deal

I went to I think the words I used were

lense Chado Colossus Shadow of the

Colossus this and I went up to the

head and went like that and then it just

immediately ate me right yes and then he

went down its gullet both Chamba and

Wamba dying in this thing which was also

spitting up zombies this t-rex was

spitting up zombies but Umbra was able

to turn a bunch of them d/f and evil and

were able to smack down a bunch of them

and eventually with the fireball the

Beast toppled over at which point dragon

bait or if which point

evylyn slashed it open like a tauntaun

and dragon bait crawled inside this dead

thing and pulled jumba's lifeless corpse

out so that he could be stabilized by

declare ik and then the decision was

made to go back to get Wamba who was

also jammed in this thing's throat but

nobody wanted to go in so dragon bait

sighed deeply and crawled back in to get

the Goblin only to realize he rolled in

at 20 on his death save one was brought

to life and crawled out through the dead

Tyrannosaurus his mouth on his own

leaving dragon bait inside searching a

futile e for

you need took a selfie oh yeah drawing

or right yes did I miss anything I took

another selfie when I was invisible

right but the invisible selfie is just a

photo because I was playing a character

that people would want to die

unfortunately I did not good time so we

are still at the encampment both goblins

are miraculously still alive defying all

logic rotting burnt t-rex corpse lying

in the middle of the encampment and

here's another apology Jeff isn't here

because it turns out he was really

really freaking sick during twitchcon

and just kind of toughed it out and then

as soon as we got home I forced him to

go to the emergency room because he's

really freaking sick and he was still

trying to play today until like ten

minutes before this when he was feeling

faint and looks very pale and I sent him

to bed so I'm sorry he's not alright I'd

like everybody to make perception checks

okay twelve eight nine dear after the

Beast Falls and you're wondering if

dragon baits going to emerge at some

point from its carcass you spot

something back over toward the giant

statue you can see what appeared to be

two chalten children standing on top of

the dais right by one of the statues big

feet one might be a boy one might be a

girl

they're both roughly the same height and

they're wearing the sod they're wearing

necklaces which just looked like they

had little shells and bones and other

sort of totemic

things stuck on them can i discern from

where I am what exactly there is they're

doing there they're looking at you

they're both staring at you or maybe the

dead dinosaur behind ya they're

definitely casting their eyes in your

direction you can see that they're both

sort of scantily clad they were like

very little clothing barefoot cuz I'm

more concerned where they came from than

what they're doing

don't kill them we know your track

record whoa hey

well I point them out to the rest of the

party just be like and then I guess I'll

ask umbral cuz I feel like she wouldn't

know anything if there's like a nearby

[Music]

encampment or city or something that

these children would have came from not

that she knows of

she knows that farther up the river is

where she was told the order of the

gauntlet has set up a new camp camp

vengeance but she doesn't expect any

children to be there she's right aware

of any villages these the she all she

tells you is that these jungles are so

overrun with Undead these days that a

human village wouldn't survive for long

out here the heck as you're watching

them death and obviously umbrella is

looking at where you're looking as well

the rest of the waffle crew seems

distracted by various things even

stomping around in her big giant form

and still completing the door offer axe

and doing her thing and Strix is cutting

some part of the dead dinosaur off

probably future Jumba and one bar of

having each other on the shoulders

even's really enjoying being large by

the way she's like well how big a pepper

and I make

she starts enjoying herself away too

much i dispel that you're probably right

it's best for me not to begin thinking

as though I am larger than I really am

as all of us truly are very small in the

[Music]

land you've been in your waffle hut when

you look out through it you can see yeah

they took care of the dinosaur just fine

and also you gave me the finger at one

point so I just like to say that was

very rude Alton it sounds about right

[Laughter]

they can't write to you blah blah let us

in your Hut please we're all gonna die

everything's been like settled and layup

dispelled ahead and I walk out it was

like alright dear oh nothing much do you

have you see the girl climb up onto the

shoulders of the boy so now they have

like found what looks like a goblin

totem like you saw before I'm certain

these are human they they are definitely

human

not goblins correct and then they with

the girl on the boys back shoulders they

turn around and move away from you

through some vines between the feet of

the statue huh

it might be humans raised by goblins I

don't like it when they stack on each

other like that no me neither

Raley's so I imagine the rest you kind

of heard about it what the rest of you

when you look you don't see anything

except two big giant stone feet on top

of the dais and then some moving bones

yeah I must have not have noticed those

vines earlier when we were inspecting

the statue so I'm gonna head back that

way and try to get a closer look at to

where it is that they went wait you can

see behind some of the vines a

passageway digging deep into the hill a

tunnel going between the legs of the

statue into the underground

and you can see roots and other things

breaking through the study ancient stone

work of this passageway the stones are

not very well fitted the whole passage

is kind of crooked and leaning and it's

about a little less than 10 feet wide

okay so not naturally formed but still

quite old that is correct it was

obviously it's a masonry construction

this tunnel and it goes back as far as

you can see all right yeah this again

asking umbral see if she knows anything

dragon bait can commune that she knows

new thing okay mama

at this point in time dragon base

jessica.meyer dragon blade it's just

climbing out of the throat of the dead

t-rex and shaking all the crap off could

you like clean him up a little bit Strix

he's kind of grossing me out

yeah all prestidigitation some of the

gross cassava just clean that off and

then picked up some of the pieces oh

dang it okay well I can I'll see what's

up with these kids said they were

looking at us very intently which makes

me politics real good with kids maybe we

can have him talk to him um no kids for

me I'm fine I love kids

I eat them all the time should I see

what they're this fella

should I should I should I roll a thing

yeah so when you appear in through the

entrance make a perception check to see

if you can see him you've got dark

vision so you're a little bit better yes

18 okay yes you can see that they've run

ahead the little girl on the boys

shoulders about 60 feet into the tunnel

and are just kind of giggling to

themselves as they sort of caper and

he's not having a whole lot of trouble

carrying her but there a couple points

where he seems to almost fall over but

she's laughing and having a grand old

time and they're getting slowly further

away from you like I said that's

probably fine looks like they're having

a good time guys I'm glad they're

enjoying themselves best let them be on

their way

just kidding we should probably tell

yeah we should even close over okay

evylyn will float into the place you

notice even when it gets very dark very

quickly after about 20 feet in there are

no light sources to speak of I'm in like

a cave thing you're in a tunnel ten feet

wide that's just going deeper into the

hill oh this is probably fine standard

no I threw that it's strong you know

what's funny is that my boots actually

glow and your boots glow yeah oh no they

go in the moonlight there's something

else I have that glows that's not in the

moonlight I keep forgetting what it is

your personality no I don't know so

never mind I don't have any light well

if you're going in there and see

everyone leaving I can follow you and

just hold some fire yeah okay

so evil ones gonna float in realize

she's in total darkness and then Strix

will follow her with what I think I'll

just make something instead I'm fire

okay there's there's a lot of vegetation

and yeah you pull out some fish and you

light it Diana Tori Jake and off you go

you got a torch okay well you um Strix

only get about five feet in when the

floor around you crumbles away and you

fall into a pit god damn it

[Laughter]

fine I was floating you that's why you

did not trigger the pit did I see this

yeah so you see Strix just I say it's

nice for you to drop in damage here see

how okay I am oh ok dokie so Strix you

take eight points of damage as you fall

twenty feet to the bottom of this pit do

I hear all of this going down yes that's

probably fine yeah guys I think our legs

broke our fall so what you saw evylyn

was basically just this light source

coming toward you and then it fell

through the floor and it's now really

dim you just need some light coming up

from a hole in the floor and I did hear

the trademark Strix ah yes I go in after

okay kind of float down see how she's

doing

yeah she she's picking herself up off

the floor

I'm gonna call my broom sadly so evylyn

can help pull Strix out of the pit which

side of the pit you want to pull around

on the deep side or the side deep side

all right so the two of you are now on

one side of the pit and the rest of the

waffle crew is on the other at this

point in time waffles comes up behind

you death and just kind of stands there

and all right oh no your mommy's fine

are they both on the

other side of the page there all right I

can I can I mandolin ride and just float

across okay sweet Kent you know I have a

way of flying hey dear can you pick me

up and throw me over there I can throw

you both do you think it's throw you

easy no I can I can jump it you don't

need to toss me it's tense are you sure

ten feet yeah it's nothing okay I float

over and I grab Wamba okay and I like I

like put him in a little ball I kind of

twirl them a little bit like this do you

do a trick I do I do it like a dab in

the air I mean I feel the spirits in the

area get really upset okay then as just

making strength athletics check for me

evylyn fear goggle in towson i-i-i guess

I can thirteen great yes one but lens on

the other side chumbo is now on the

other on the opposite side for his

brother is not happy about that I forgot

that you were there you didn't die in

that drone service Rex did ya

alright I go over and I try to grab him

to throw him to make another check does

he let me grab him yep okay oh that one

is a 10 okay

he lands on the other side of the pit by

hit just basically grabbing on to the

edge so one by you see your brother

hanging on by his stubby fingers and

spur his feet scratching up against the

edge of the pit trying to gain purchase

I'll float over and try to help him you

want to help him one barn you did you

just go let your brother yeah he kind of

needs the exercises being there

one blow will successfully make a

strength check so by the time you get

over to him evylyn he's already managed

to pull himself up and then he he gives

his brother a stern talking-to idea

backs up several feet then gets a

running start to leap over the pit you

can use my second-story work yep

so I can jump using my dexterity

modifier yes 17 nice there's probably

like a vine or something that I grab

onto and like swing off of and like flip

and like land on my feet under their

side that could work you could also just

like run up the wall alright okay you

are now with the exception of umbral

dragon bait and waffles who quite

frankly are contempt to wait and see

what happens on the other side of the

pit are now all together yeah waffles

you just stay back there and stay safe

she cannot fit in this tiny hole are you

sure I'm it you make are smaller not

long enough

no she's right this is more dangerous if

she comes along with us let's go pad oh

yeah I'm just gonna like push the end to

the front good please okay at the floor

when you push when you push death ahead

of you whirling blades come out of the

walls

[Laughter]

yeah make a dexterity saving throw so

Chris would you call it a just this is

just a trap right this is a trap great

advantage versus traps excellent never

fear Wow well one of them is a one okay

[Laughter]

that's bad in this game yeah yes yes

okay 15 total

okay well because of your advantage you

do not get literally torn to pieces by

all the blades you take a little bit of

damage from some of them a total of nine

points of slashing damage which ooh

you cannot uncanny dodge because it's

not an attack right just a but I do have

evasion so I take no damage on

successful saving throws excellent

so you totally on Chris Perkins even

there you go even though Strix

deliberately pushed you into the blade

trap critical dodges yes it looks

glorious and you get through it to the

other side safely and then all the

cycling blades just sort of retract into

the walls and be ceiling yeah done nice

like jeez like a strict outlook of now

behind UDF you can see that there are

some cobwebs sort of block in the

passage but there's like a through them

you can make it what looks like that the

passage eventually is going to come to a

high ledge it looks like a wall at first

but then you can see there's a gap above

it so it's just a Ledge okay do I still

see the kid at this point make a

perception check I'm just moving 13 so

you do see the kids they are on top of

the ledge and I'm going fast the lip

since the ledge is higher than they both

are that's they must have liked

something done some sort of acrobatics

to get up there and it just sort of

watching you at the top of the ledge but

the other thing you notice with your 13

is that the cobwebs between you and them

have not been disturbed all right cool

good so the sighting blaze I just went

through there they like did he finish up

or did he they say have finished and

gone back into the walls okay am i doing

having the knowledge that I have my

convinced that they are can still be

triggered yes

balls someday so before I can mess with

any of the whatever ghost kids we're

dealing with I'm gonna start figuring

out whatever I need to do to disable

siding blades traps and potentially

everything in front of us thank you for

calling on me what if we set it off and

then I try casting nature's wrath and

just wrap some vines around them hold

them in place

well that just cuts of the vines I mean

I don't know I mean if Lysander Wilma it

will let me try this first I able to

locate whoever it is that sets these

awesome button pressure plate mm-hmm

mind whatever making a perception check

[Applause]

la crosse yeah do that yep

so with that rule you can ascertain that

there doesn't seem to be any mechanical

trigger for this trap suggesting that

there's some magic involved that somehow

consents magically the passage and

creatures between the blades that simple

just cast them to spell magic doesn't

someone know how to do that I do oh yeah

no I don't thank you I tried

this book and it's just like I skipped

out on that class you just you just went

to human eating 101

yeah but dia if you think that it might

be possible because you can actually see

the slats that these blades come out of

that you can try to manually jam them

with something like okay stuff something

in them so that they can't pop out yeah

if there's like nearby like rocks or

stones or anything can use that whatever

remainder we have of Mortain kinds poll

we could use I mean it did end up coming

in India I guess thanks for coming you

can essentially break the pole into

pieces and gram the pieces of the pole

into the slots to block them yeah all

right just make a you're gonna do this

work DF coz you're the master trap was a

but just make a strengths check for me

to see how well you know you don't think

this is hard but okay while he's working

on that and I did dimension door to

where he is you sure can your hand

friend Andrew how is he doing

see chillin yeah he's just chillin he's

challenged I hate it well you know what

it takes offense to that yes sure okay

you believe you have done a good job

okay good it should be six pastor gang

oh good

I put chumba and Wamba like protectively

right behind me like a mom dual mom army

right I'm like all right

all right now boys let's go and I start

just like cautiously

yeah cautiously stepping forward I

accidentally call you mom

[Laughter]

that brings a nice rosy grin to evylyn

space

okay so Strix you pass through as a

cloud and you can hear the trap making

noises like it wants to read through you

but it's too jammed up to move and you

get through just fine and even the same

thing happens as you strive forth with

the with the goblins by the hand the

trap wants to just rip you to

smithereens but it can't because the DF

has bummed it up evylyn whispers like a

nice encouraging little sermon at them

as they're going she's like Lysander

keeps us safe in his holy life just like

when DF put those poles in there to keep

evil from us the theater also keeps evil

from us by bathing us in this holy blah

blah blah blah blah the Strix is

covering her ears already okay you all

get past the sighting blades and ahead

you see that it comes to a wall that's

about seven feet high and then there's a

Ledge on top of it and the tunnel

continues up now at a higher altitude

beyond that so climbing the ledge would

be your next challenge the children that

are at the top of the ledge you see them

and then the little girl climbs up onto

the shoulders and back the little boy

turns and disappears

further down the tunnel why come back do

you want do you hear them just sort of

laughing playfully at one another funny

tell us the joke you don't want to know

the truth no we got in here that's the

joke I think we're the punchline

check on these kids to see if maybe

they're an illusion sure all right I

don't know I rolled the - I don't know

even with my squats like seven or eight

I don't know now climbing up to the

ledge is no big deal for you guys you

can just sort of alley-oop each other up

all right and pull the last person up

big deal even here waffles

back at the entrances ponting who comes

down the passageway and once you're on

top of the ledge you can see that the

tunnel continues on for another 20 feet

and then there's another ledge and on

that second ledge is a door guess we'd

better open and go through that yep

the children have gotten by the time you

pull yourself up the children have

gotten to that ledge

the little boy just sort of tosses the

little girl up a few feet so she can

grab on the ledge she scampers up

she then leans down extends her hands

the boy jumps up she grabs him by the

hands and they pull each other up to the

higher ledge how far are they roughly

from us twenty feet could I try to fairy

fire them yes I think you can do one of

them okay yeah that's a single creature

if these guys are in fact creatures I

thought was actually yeah any creature

in the air actually you know you can

heart cast it on the area and get them

both if they fail their dexterity saving

throws okay so both of them are outlined

in a color of your choice

blue green or violet let's go okay

well thank you complement you're real

they're there they're both aglow they

kind of look each other up and down to

see that the both glowing and they kind

of giggle at one another and somehow I

made them creepier I think they look

just beautiful and I bet they have all

sorts of wonderful stories to tell us

that'll make us laugh just like them

tears go that I'm still cloud so I just

I just hover next to you and judge you

Strix I feel you doing that I'll

continue pressing forward actively

looking for traps this entire time yeah

make one more perception check all right

thirteen you don't mind any traps as you

make it rate for it there's a lot of

sort of filth and dirt and mud and stuff

around you and the walls are kind of

leaning in at strange angles this place

is not held up over time very well but

you do make it all the way to the ledge

and again it's another little bit of a

leap for you to get to the higher ledge

and then the doors at the back of the

ledge could it could could I use that

question yeah absolutely okay I'm gonna

do it our kitchen is always on it lets

you see it's always on oh yeah you're

good so you can see most clearly of all

you and Strix as the children when DF

gets that close to them oh great a walk

through the door oh come on like did

they open it or just walk through just

walk through it like they're gone that's

not how you use the door at all I can

cloud up and kind of just try and get

through Pete speak a little that's a

good door okay that sounds good yep

we're gonna like shake my arms and Diaz

like I'm gonna try and peek through the

door yeah I understand exactly what her

frantic mesh motions mean

all right

yes tricks in your gaseous form you

think you there's no keyhole or anything

on the door it's just sealed but there

it's not a perfect seal so you can

basically slip through it or under it or

over it and with your dark vision you

see beyond the door is a short little

hallway but then it opens into what

appears to be a very large room

illuminated by slivers of sunlight

coming down from some unknown place high

above it feels like beyond this door

you've just entered a cobweb infested

vault oh the most dominant feature you

see ahead is what appears to be a pillar

of stone going up as high as you can see

and a narrow stone staircase winding up

the outside of it whoa so I'm guessing

there's something on this pillar and you

see the kids again the girl on the back

on the shoulders of the boy going up

those stairs interesting when I'm under

through the door is there any sort of

mechanism or something I could see that

would open the door from the other side

[Music]

yes there is great can I do a perception

check to see if there's any traps that

are going to kill me if I touch it you

can't actually search for traps oh you

are incapable of even looking for them

great door then I guess I will find a

place some place that looks I don't know

innocuous like maybe there's not a

mm-hmm and oh did I bring I did bring my

broom with me didn't I but it's probably

uh no it's on the other side it's not

with me what am i doing okay I will run

cloud then and use my mage hand far away

from me to push this thing by the door

okay the mage hand is not strong enough

to move damn

no can I use a stick we just broke that

pole up in a whole bunch of pieces murti

cardi B so mad yeah if you're a solid

you can try hmm the door pulls in on

your side so you've got to pull it all

right I'm gonna count okay a major burn

on myself and then def ward could could

my really quick good night I was gonna

say we need a ham to try and get up

there got one of those oh that's true

but he's on peace you guys are on the

other side of the door oh that's right

yeah um sorry I'm just gonna I'm just

gonna do it I just I just I'll do it

okay you're going to pull open the door

yes sounds good and I'm like hold on the

rest of you see the door open and strix

standing on the far side looking real

scared at this point and I'm deaath

you're right below the door up against

the ledge the rest of the party is still

20 feet back standing at the top of the

other ledge I'm sure it's fine check for

traps I literally can't do that pull

myself up and uh due to their once-over

okay go ahead and make a perception

check hey it's a good one 36 oh yes you

can see on the frame of the door a tiny

glyph ah that looks like that glyph

could go off if somebody passes through

the door put a hand up like stops tricks

for like moving forward or anything

I'll fight to the glyph because this is

like this like a magical infusion I

don't yeah I only have a way of dealing

with this do i you do you think you

could try to disarm the glyph just by

sort of disfiguring it by doing so

without triggering it will require a

dexterity check and your thieves tools

yes

I back up you are made for this you got

this yeah whole lot like a knife

twirling little quick and go away can

you play a song for him

scratch that real fast oh man boy can I

please I do all right

so he gives you inspirations you get a

d8 on top of here yeah which instrument

[Music]

maracas all right a little shimmy do is

his pickin it's more distracting than

inspiring I didn't know you even had

maracas this is a new one

alright so it's just a dexterity check

6:30 okay I do have expertise and

thieves tools I'll put mine one mighty

being thief expertise abilities in these

tools okay okay

alright so with

palton inspiration point you alright you

disable the glyph

[Laughter]

all right all right and then I like to

waive the rest of the crew up forward

okay you guys all advance you pull

yourselves up the ledge so that you're

all kind of now in the doorway and

pushing into the vault closer inspection

of the vault reveals that this wide

square room filled with cobwebs that

central pillar does not go all the way

up to the ceiling it stops just short

and it's about the room is about 40 feet

high the pillar is 30 feet high and like

I said it has that narrow staircase

spiraling up the outside of it all the

way to the top in addition to the web's

you can see the floor is covered with

dust and there are what appear to be

dinosaurs owns littering it the two

children are right at the top of the

pillar kind of peering down at you and

the little girls like do you think that

song zombie zombie t-rex

and then they just sort of scuttle out

of you I'm sure they just really want to

show us something real cool and that's

why they keep teasing us in here evylyn

want to go look at that what that is

yeah totally even just awesome I want to

follow - okay go evil flies up when one

starts going up the stick when he one

sees one but kind of like struggling up

the stairs she reaches back and like

grabs his little hand like a mom - and

like dry like half helping him up the

stairs she's not like lifting him but

you know how when like a kid is going

way slower than an adult they're like

dragging them along behind them so he's

like skipping a stair - and she's like

so what was like going up the stairs but

you're like floating off this side as

you both come up

all right everybody make perception

checks oh natural natural 20 oh

yeah I mean I got a 20 with my so dirty

20 30 20 to 20 not 20 to 20 as well okay

anybody else so this is embarrassing but

I got a one wholly uncharacteristic of

do you know Jumba roll the six but he

yeah strix and evylyn and Wamba as you

begin to as one begins to go up the

stairs you notice one other feature on

the pillar that's not readily visible

because the pillar is so dusty and there

are cobwebs but you can see carved up

the pillar sort of following the path of

the staircase are carvings of a man

carrying a crocodile I know this story

well my have you heard this story

through I was the one that I was the one

that told you I'm so glad that our

friendship means something at that point

one of us steps on the third step and

sets off a glyph trap and you see a

spurt of lightning erupted from the

pillar and electrocute him executed yes

because we're doing metal armor so yeah

yeah your aura does help so he gets what

advantage on his saving throws is that

right yeah he gets a bonus

oh no to my charisma modifier so he gets

four bonus all right so one boy I need

your bonus my bonus one bet I survived

okay so I need you to make a dexterity

saving through and what that is is a 20

plus your dexterity bonus which is +3

okay yeah I see that plus another five

because you've got the paladin come on

come on baby

[Laughter]

all right this who are you I don't know

as the Lightning erupts around one but

he dodges part of it it only takes half

damage so one but you take 11 points of

damage

ow reducing I like to think too that

that like to there's no wall on this

spiral staircase right it's like opening

on one side I like to think that he like

dodges like like slow I didn't even like

like has his hand and he just like

rotates around Egeland and back on all

right

because yeah that's awesome cool because

he's saved as a throw I'm gonna say the

current did not get through to you even

sweet he was able to leap off in time

and you pull him back onto the staircase

and he has sort of lands on the next

he's doing really cool combo move all

right

yes so after the flash of electricity

there's just like a little cloud hanging

in the air and wamba is a couple steps

higher than he was before

ah watch out for there's a lightning

thing here yeah I could use a band-aid I

don't know if that helps lightening

injuries but I'll just zoom up on my

booboo and just be like I am are these

goblins and mortal I'm concerned when

evylyn says here's that he could use a

band-aid she's like oh here let me help

you and she's already holding his hand

so she lays on hands for like I don't

know how many hit points there's a

little goblin have 13 how many do you

need she goes buzzes 11 hit points in

right here back up to full and they're

seeing that that comes straight from

Lysander you know that god I told you

about he's real nice oh it came straight

from him I'm still about dead are the

night serpent we can't change that

I don't preach my religion all the time

to you and you just won't shut up about

it I just can't help it I'm just so in

love with the Holy Light of Lysander the

shines down around all of us and comes

through our souls and helps us relate to

each other and have beautiful like set

off and I saw like the sparkle yeah

I'll sort of make my way I've run the

stairs to that area okay like looking

for the glyph to see if it was like a

one time ignition or I need to disfigure

it again or whatever and I'll just be on

my broom and just zoom up next to you

it looks like that blip I thought was

there is gone now oh good you did it

thank you all right so as before

continue on sure yeah yeah yeah I'll go

first

yeah please you to flood off to the side

well um but stay behind me Palmer you

want come up on this to look we're to

live so DF is taking the lead up the

staircase DF as you go you pass by all

these images of the man with the

crocodile on his back climbing stuff

after step after step make a perception

check 23 you see another glyph on the

tenth step deer everywhere they're

freaking everywhere all right I'll start

like wait we just very carefully step

over it or some other things where I

think just passing it or what set it off

you're not sure you try to step over it

I'll scratch it off no no scratch it off

okay okay guys I think I have an idea

maybe if one of you gives me a piggyback

I might not get that tired I would give

you a piggyback then I couldn't fly very

well you don't fly that well anyway oh I

guess you're right none of us really do

anything well compared to the holy

majesty of one started with lander nah

man that I mean so we're gonna give them

a piggyback ride is anyone gonna give me

a piggyback ride

like the tale this story I refuse I mean

nobody was combined into one bigger

person one Bob will climb on to paltin

shoulders and as DF is scratching away

at the glyph paltin runs up the stairs

make a roll for you left yet this is

another dexterity yeah one okay use you

managed to scratch it out and palton and

one all the way up safely wait wait

where's where's Chamba do you put job on

your shoulders come bus not going on my

back do it

I'm not putting gel on my back it's a

good workout clearly pass all these

things just fine without it

let's come see ours put gum on your bag

halted yeah you're at the top of the

pillar you see the kids aren't there

there is light coming through what

appears to be a hole in the roof in the

vault the roof vault has actually worked

stone with mortar bricks set into it and

it hasn't held up well over the years

their roots breaking through and other

things but there is a hole in it enough

that light seems to shine right down

onto the top of this pillar and you

realize you're standing on this circle

of stone that has under the dust some

sort of symbol cool do you think there's

like a special crocodile ritual that

happens here maybe we all need to go on

each other's shoulders and create a

tower well I'm gonna one last time

trouble on your shoulders no they just

go up to the top and prestidigitation

the dust away

Sam alone good sound effect all of you

all the dust blows off and you see it as

a symbol of the Sun

nevermind we're done here I'll kneel

down a little on it sound like a very

good piggyback like it's not like up on

the shoulders it's more like like hands

around like the shoulders I got legs

around the waist cuz I can't quite quite

place them up I'm gonna top me like that

oh he'll try to climb right up on copy a

can do that he's strong right he'll

climb right up in your shoulders and you

can walk up the stairs with him it's a

little awkward but you're able to get up

without any injury great you even passed

buying you know glyph for two and it

doesn't seem to set them off I guess I

just didn't need you to do all that work

do you look at it all I see all right so

it's actually now that you're all up

here it's kind of crowded because the

top of the pillar is only about you know

five feet in diameter but I'll look for

the stairs okay and chumbo go to and

then I'm fine okay even you can see that

there is a central circle which is sort

of an orangey color and then there are

all these radiating triangles forming

the Rays that go out to the edge and

they're sort of a more of a yellowish

color and there are grooves sort of

carving the Sun symbol out you think

that this is some sort of ancient symbol

or insignia possibly to a Sun God

I love Sun God I spit on it you think

you see one this big land on this sunny

no no she takes them in like my holy

symbols that's the way to earn the ire

of a great and mighty powerful beings

very disrespectful tender told me to do

it well dinner is not a very good

influence I don't think you should spend

much more time with tender that's not

what tender said we do I look like I

care what Denver thinks if tender told

you to walk off this pillar would you do

it right now yeah just be Brad just walk

off this pillar right now okay what is

happening start to walk off the pillar

and just as I'm walking past I cross

punch DM today twelve

yeah you see this coming body sink your

fist attaches air yeah it looks like

you're used to getting punched in the

balls yeah gonna stop anyone from

walking off the thing and just put like

float my broom down just put my hand

I'll be like I don't just stop this like

people Indian sense yeah talk about this

later you can sense the power in this

place even this is a this is a huge sort

of tug for you is this symbol you feel

like it was put here for a reason and it

has some sort of magical property can I

should I roll a religion check to see if

I know what that magical property is

sure ten you don't know you could like

bless it or something I ask your God or

whatever I mean I would go and I just

kind of like I was gonna go stand on it

or sit on it but then I'm kind of like

worried about that so I hover right over

the middle of it with my boots and I say

oh sweet holy lord of the morning bless

your servant and this her moment of

uncertainty with the knowledge of how

you would wish us to use this great

power

of your Holy Name I pressed I pressed it

in the the spin away as she's doing you

get rid of the spit okay a the circle in

the center of the Sun seems to sink down

into the stone sunlight to spill up all

around

evylyn until she's just completely

illuminated and the latest flashing

offer her golden boots and kind of

razzle dazzling mall around the room

guys I think my spit did it and she sort

of does this little twirl over the over

the light of the Sun coming up out of

the pillar and an instant later you see

that that sort of sunken part in the

center of the Sun start to come back up

again and the light begin to dim but now

there's something resting on top of it

you can see it is a scintillating flask

of sunlight liquid I grab it all right

one buzz got the flash go sunlight it is

it is a delicate sort of crystalline

flask with this radiant liquid just

pouring light out from it grabs little

wrists careful you just let her have it

we won't hear the end of it please I got

something better for you I'll pull up

the Raptor croaks I know you know what

I'll give it to you if you say Sade

endar is cool Dan directly I try to

snatch it from actually I don't she just

shakes his little wrist she doesn't want

anything to happen

[Laughter]

I got a goblin on my back I'll drop it

no it's fine you just it's because he's

he I'm imagining that there's the floor

and he has his little hands on it on the

floor and I'm just kind of like pinning

his little wrist down to the floor I

will smash this say $10 great I'm very

strong you cannot move from the holy

morning Lord I just don't want to be

evil to come to it it's not mine it

doesn't belong to any of us and then I

give it back to you why did I say

whatever even like very gingerly wipes

no no I'll get I'll take it off for you

it's fine don't touch it John it's gone

okay now he ones holding it like this

and just like the light is like

radiating onto her face like a if she

could cry a little single tear would

would roll down her face but it doesn't

so I just get wider and wider and wider

her big construct eyes does she know

anything about what this is can I roll

another religion check apparently it's

heroin I'm just gonna keep rolling the

exact same thing over and over again do

you know there five it's it was a six

name as last time so Tennant I'm going

to do a religion check because I'm

scared of it working okay go ahead

much better 20700 what you know more

about the sunlight less than I do

oh yes I do tricks you just sort of

hover next evil and as she cradles the

flask gently and you just sort of stare

at it and take a good look at it and

think long and hard about what it could

be you do believe that it is

it is a very very potent magical elixir

if you also sense although you'd love to

be able to do further tests on it but

you use sense that it has incredible

transformative ability Oh sting Janet

pour it on something no I think this has

some sort of transformative ability

maybe Lysander gave you a present so

that you don't have to be a robot

anymore I don't know he wouldn't give

this for me he wants us to take it and

use it for good for someone else it's

for you just drink it

pour it on night for me no I don't think

it's for you either I probably just

burst into flames like dendara takes

real good care of you trust me well

founder hasn't given evil into anything

he gives me eternal love and support

which is all I need

so here it's not poison it's for you so

you should drink it how do you know it's

for me because it's not for any of us

because we don't care about Lysander

what there's plenty of things we get and

we carry with us until we need to use

them on someone else I can't just like

gobble the don't give it from my set in

your mouth summoned it for us

don't make me force it into your mouth

you know I'm not joking even looks very

torn because she really doesn't believe

this is for her but strict she wants to

make Strix happy mm-hmm and you just

like dip your finger in it like rub a

little on yourself see if it does

anything no I mean there's already

tested yeah stick your finger in it I

grabbed her hand and like put her finger

into it I suppose I suppose it's a good

idea to test and see what happens too

before we pour it on someone else and I

let her get my little finger in it all

right your finger just barely fits down

into the neck of the flask and you're

you sort of dip your little woody finger

into

there and you you DAP the liquid nothing

happens you think that it needs to be

imbibed so you have to drink it then

drinking I take I take the little tiny

bit that's on my finger go see I tried

it curses like why I ran up in her

finger only after she tried to lick it

off herself you do suck her finger yes

okay no benefits other than your tongue

all right do you think you'll have to

drink the whole thing

oh yeah what's source actually yeah go

for it

yeah whatever who cares just drink it

listen even we have evil souls in us I

think you can drink something that was

given to you from Lysander well maybe

you guys need to drink it then don't we

don't you maybe that's a transformative

power is Paulding Dalton favor here do

your mind saying and get her to drink it

cool

Alton do a bad can I can I can I make a

persuasion ello need to make me do

something I didn't want to do he is

above that strict you are too I'm

titling over and like a bad influences I

it'd be pretty funny though I should

just like yeah I know anyway I'm just

like you know what I think you should do

it that is my persuasion alright what

are you role we're opposing spear

suasion detector

Kris frictions technically you can't

really persuade another player character

due to something they don't want to do

so but you can just explain in words

what you want her to do and then Anna

will decide if he wants to do it I think

that because your whole party thinks

that you should do this thing that means

it's a thing that you should do because

give in to peer pressure you whoa now

all right paltin you you saw what

happened when I saw at the end or last

time and you know of all people that he

probably wouldn't be sending this for me

he doesn't want anything to do with me

even I don't think there's anyone else

who could have brought that forth who

knows who knows how long it's been here

it's been waiting for a single purpose

and in that entire time no one else has

obtained it until you he's got a point

bow I don't necessarily saying you have

to drink it now but I do think this is

for you even kind of looks up she kind

of like looks at Strix and paulten to

see if they're gonna add anything I just

looks at her it is like you really I

mean what did you offend him more if you

turn down his gifts even looks very

scared by this she kind of looks at the

flask she looks at paltin she looks at

Jumba and Wamba and then she just kind

of like nods @df like in thanks

and then she drinks it all right

the luminous substance courses down

Evelyn's throat and an instant later

after the flask is completely drained

you see the the light just seemed to

swell around her and then she's gone

at all - Jordan spin across tints should

have thrown it evylyn are you still here

oh not even the flask is around she's

she's just been completely lost in the

sunlight III cast it's like it's like it

turned her into a burst of sunlight and

then she was gone it's like okay

who's got who's got a raven costume

players I cast that thing that makes me

go invisible invisable what was that the

the armor of shadows yeah or sorry no

that's your major armor to do - how did

you turn no oh yeah armor shadows yes

all right and then I go I say I'm

banished - and then very good it was

transformative properties not

teleportation properties I start

thinking like I'm wrong like I was right

I thought I was right I know magic so

I'm gonna put chump it down okay and

then I'll kind of go to even was he kind

of reach out for her to see if like

she's still like physically here or not

okay and then like also checked like the

dusty top to see you like maybe her foot

is still there footprints are still

there or whatever just look for anything

okay

as you begin to search the room begins

to tremble and the pillar you can hear

it sort of cracking a little bit under

your weight and then bits of the ceiling

the blocks start to fall away like the

whole settling is coming down oh no one

of those blocks just goes and crashes

down next idea Paulson can you cast fly

on dance can i you've already used that

today Oh

like you know

like me we gotta get out of here I will

I will cloud cloud Paulson and Deus

now let's make a slower yeah but you

won't get crushed yeah we still have

little trouble to get out of here well

let's all roll initiative shall we

except for evil a-hole

except dude I have actually a whole

email prep that I was gonna send to

Chris of Yvonne's backstory for it

before this episode and I was like I

want to go over it one more time before

I send it to him and now like who knows

[Laughter]

alright so when I got 59 initiative 12

oh sorry death got 12 palton a lot of

these happening today giving you all

that luck

14 14 you know you always roll 20s when

evens in trouble mate so you're welcome

yes Samba roll the tongue character all

right

so paulten you're actually the first to

go is the room begins to tremble all

around you it looks like Strix means to

cast a spell on you what do you do like

 okay do the thing and then then

we'll do a leaf and I will wait for the

spell to be cast upon my body all right

one by ya as the ceiling falls down

around you

what can you do oh not die you know I'm

so let me just get the lay of the land

write something this pillar thing thirty

feet high the floor is thirty feet below

you covered with dinosaur bones there's

one exit from the room and that's the

way you came hmm and the distance

between us and the door is is 30 feet

down and then temple feet off okay all

right there were stairs wrapping around

the pillar but you know that that's okay

so I've got to get down ideally yes okay

so here's my plan

I'm pretty small

pretty light right true you're about so

I'm gonna grab I've got a blanket in my

inventory okay and I'm gonna grab both

corners with to my hands right yeah and

I'm gonna just you know there's a little

bit of wizard bit of wind can I feel

anything nothing

mm-hmm well guys at least we're gonna

die nice and warm and cool with a

blanket okay that that was

that's not gonna work

diem says there's no air all right well

in that case I panic I'm invisible I

just grab onto the one that I think is

gonna survive the most I deem that to be

strix okay wrong straight one buck claps

on classic donkey but you can't see me

cuz I'm invisible right you can feel him

but gross actually

yeah this is not technically an attack

so yeah all right and then he hopes for

the best Strix you said you were gonna

cast a spell on somebody oh yes so I am

going to cast gaseous form on Diaz

mm-hmm first as I know Paulding can fly

oh no he can't fly but I'm to cast an

audience and then I'm also going to get

on my broom and what about jumbo well

he's on me so he can get on my shoulders

on you chumba well he down palton okay

fine I will clog Moulton instead if your

plans to if you plan to take Chamba

Dalton is now a cloud alright paltin you

are a gaseous form moving slower than

before but resistant to falling bricks

actually idea of this faster so I'll

count cloud paulsen because do you come

run faster yeah great

while in cloud form Colton you move 10

feet on your turn and your resistance to

non-magical damage and

can pass through small holes narrow

openings and mere cracks you can fly but

you can't talk or manipulate objects and

you can't cast spells so you're a cloud

Strix has Wamba attached to her the

Strix you still have some movement all

right so if I am one but I can carry on

my broom no no okay I can't then I am

going to try and I can hold him though

and I can dimension door nope no you

leave him behind

only one creature passes through a

dimension door yeah you would that would

make you a bad person can I hand my

broom to Chumbawamba and tell them to

get out on it

sure alright which one you want to give

it to well the one grabbing on to my leg

I'm gonna say here's this take this and

go with your brother

it flies go out the thing are you

talking to me yes no I'm gonna hold on a

year your turn is over

Chat Chat keeps saying and has said a

lot of times whenever we use dimensioned

or that they think that two people can

go through dimension door so Chris do

you want to set the record straight you

[Music]

teleport yourself from your current

location to any other sponsored range

you can bring along objects as long as

their weight doesn't exceed what you can

carry you can also bring along one

willing creature of your size or smaller

so there it is okay I was gonna say get

rekt chat but smaller but yep smaller so

I can actually be genuine actually

thanks jack all right well then they

don't get my broom

door I don't know how far away the

outside is you boy can you see thee can

you guy go through walls and just you

ain't gets the outside like that I don't

know what Chad is trying to make sure I

survive any other spot within range you

can arrive at exactly the spot desired

it can be a place you can see or one you

can visualize or one that you can

describe by stating distance and

direction such as 200 feet straight

wherever so based on yes you absolutely

can all right you can take him take him

take him right outside all right I okay

paulten is again is a cloud yep

now could I take deep with me instead of

the Goblin is your size or smaller all

right you don't even have to let go of

them you can just grab DF and you just

disappear and suddenly Wamba is touching

on to nothing

[Laughter]

all right Strix indie author home free

[Music]

Jumba and Wamba are stuck on the pillar

[Laughter]

its jumba's turn chumbo stands next to

you or he's looking around for you wah

wah wah wah wah you let him know you're

still there yeah I'm here he's relieved

he says what's your plan oooh so kind of

high up I was kind of hoping the witch

lady would help me turns out she's a

really bad person

turns out a really bad person so if one

of us survives you have to tell the

world that she's a really bad okay so

I'm the one who survives well we don't

know that yet because I had a great idea

so chumba how much do you weigh he tells

you forty pounds okay no you know by the

way that he weighs about 80 okay so I

grab you and we jump but because I'm a

horrible person I make sure that you hit

the ground first okay

so halfway down the pillar he realizes

that you're lying so I would like you to

make either a dexterity acrobatics or

strength athletics and this is a

contestant role he's a fighter jock by

to get water he's right there right now

[Laughter]

so chumba is gonna make his strength

athletics check and you're gonna make

probably this is gonna go really bad

thing this is gonna go really bad are

you ready you got come on before you

roll let me just check so you don't have

athletic or acrobatics but your

dexterity is higher so you get a plus

three on your roll okay Anna Anna yes

Jeff still there can he roll a die for

me yeah trying to kill you I'm sorry

brother there was nothing I could do he

rolls a five okay how did you do there

awesome 19 okay okay

so you your plan comes off perfectly

you'll and you hear all your brothers

bones

yeah as the fall is pushing you you

still take some damage but it's reduced

because I'm kinda padding so you ended

up taking a total of seven points of

damage to seven all right only he wasn't

healed right I was healed if only you

weren't here yeah is he okay just so I

can say that you know bring them you

know it I leave I take the whistle

though yes you you grab his whistle and

you see the little cord is sort of

caught around his neck I just I lift it

up just like I know how necklace works

yeah well I said it's sort of mashed

into the ground that's why it's stuck

there yes you absolutely tear it free

and you've got his cherished wooden

whistle in your hands it is the end of

the round and now everybody in the room

has to make a dexterity saving through

this is only palton and 1ba oh my god is

he amazing as they allowed that yeah so

this week mate if you did all those fine

1919 again excellent never mind so what

do I get for being a cloud you just make

a normal dexterity okay well that would

be four okay some debrief passes through

your caches body paltin and deals damage

to you but you only take half so you

take five points of damage okay all

right Wamba you to succeed your

dexterity saving throw and you're only

clipped by a rock and you take five

points of damage

ooh alright and then you run out of the

room and paltin you drift out of the

room

now Wamba you get to the ledge of the

door you hop down you run you get to the

scythe blade traps they're all jammed up

so you keep running you get to the pit

the ten foot across pit and Paul things

like just sort of floating past you over

the pit left right

so I had minus seven minus five so it's

not looking great yeah yeah one hit

point so here's what I'm gonna do I have

to make the jump don't I you can see the

vault is collapsing behind you so far

the tunnel hasn't started to collapse

but it could you see the cloud give you

like an encouraging wave what did the

whistle do again makes a high-pitched

noise yeah yeah we've never actually

established that barring other than

whistle I pull out the whistle and I get

a seven all right you leap across you

hit the other side of the pit and I say

brother help me going away just as you

would fall something catches you and you

dragon base pulls you up over the other

side of the pit only because he heard

the whistle yeah he heard the whistle

turned and grabbed me all right and

palton you're out straights DF you're

out wamba comes out on dragon baits

shoulders and Chamba is buried in his

tomb I'll always remember him for what

happened it was it was it was strix his

fall if she had helped me he wouldn't

have died

so the only one who actually saw what

one but did was paltin and he's a gas

cloud

alright paltin you are flesh and bone

again witness okay I'm getting them

confused who which Chumbawamba died so

chumba the fighter died after know after

Wamba yeah shared his cunning plan to

use him as a landing pillow I look over

to Wamba I'm just like she's crazy man

she left me no choice

do I did the robot ladies was she was

she was annoying the this the the other

person is a terrible person I tell

everyone about that I might write a song

maybe perform it for me Deus I don't

know he's just years but anyway III did

what I had to do to survive I'm level

two Jesus Christ dude

I'm bro is standing there she's shaking

her head disapprovingly and baring her

tusks and she says get this creature out

of my sight

yeah that well mean that was her steward

I mean I could be your steward now she

pulls out a mace like like the spray

kind or like the big heavy mallet okay I

use where is it

I've got a retreat ability what is that

Chris expeditious retreat yeah I'm gonna

bail all right off you go is intentional

on going back like this alright

he rushes back and disappears into the

foliage and maybe we'll never see him

again

[Laughter]

evylyn yes curse Parkins you awaken in a

palace of sunlight ah and a very tall

man sort of crown

just down beside you and you see that

he's dark-skinned but his eyes are just

orbs a pure sunlight and he's got this

countenance to suggest that he is a

saint or a divine entity and

as he puts one hand on your shoulder he

says my dear you've called yourself here

to make a choice we can return you to

the form in which you were previously or

we can bestow a blessing upon you to

make you stronger and harder than you

were before last I give you the option

of restoring that which was taken from

you your shattered weapons which of

these three gifts would you like me to

bestow upon you what oh why thank you

that's very generous is this the end of

the episode where I get a week to the

side I would like to send you back to

your friends so I have the option of

being myself in my body again yep having

being a stronger construct body or

having light fall restored take your

time

well even takes some time to think about

what her friends back home would say

about this and wonders and asks them in

her mind even I sort of what would we

say as you sort of look around a lot of

the details of the room are sort of

fuzzy because ever he is so such a

presence that he seems to almost blot

out everything else but you sort of look

and there's this behind you there's this

big arch and through the arch you can

see an open

sky with like it must be seven Suns in

the sky I asked first I I'm like I was

trying to make the decision but then I

shake my hand I'm mask first who I have

the pleasure of addressing my name is

st. on drawl do I know who sings on

dramas oh yes you don't even have to

make a roll you know that he is a saint

of the the Sun Lord Lysander draw oMG

yeah he would be basically a immortal

who was elevated to la thunders court

for a lifetime of devout service I am

such a fan of your work

oh my god it is such a pleasure to meet

you I just thank you for everything

you've done for the morning Lord and his

his about I'm just wow I'm so overcome

overwhelmed what do you think I should

do he looks at you and smiles and says

these are all great gifts but to be

flesh again now could put your friends

in or could put you in some danger he

says simply because you have it

a quest ahead of you one for which being

what you are now is actually a boon well

also why why are am I be given being

given these gifts why me why now

because the morning Lord loves you he

does I know he does he does doesn't he

he always has with all his heart then I

should serve him in the best and

strongest way possible and I should be

the strongest servant that I could

possibly be for him in whatever form

that is so I want to be a stronger

version of me I will return you to your

friends good luck all right in a flash

of sunlight

evylyn descends upon the party this beam

of light just comes through the jungle

and shines down between the feet of the

statue and then evil and just

materializes there much as she looked

when she left you in her construct form

but evil and your constitution score is

now 22

you have Lysander's blessing of health

giving you that and that will of course

change your hit points geez and and

Chris I like to imagine that I have like

a new engraving because I had like a

chestplate I think it's like a fully

realized super engraved like I look the

same yeah but like extra filigree and

like my because I was missing my holy

symbol after light fall and so like I

want my holy symbol to now be like my

very self like Oh outstanding yeah so

that's in your chest the other thing you

notice is that on on her on your body

evylyn under your armor you've got this

sort of golden filigree reinforcement

cool all around your joints and things

so you're just you you look that's much

sturdier and then you did before

Zak yep awesome and that's where we'll

stop for the night one by rooms you

could come up come back at any time

[Laughter]

Ross got to pick his own alignment so if

week we're off but but in next week's

time slot we will be presenting waffle

crew sock puppet theater

[Music]

[Applause]

so Holly made some puppets and I made a

little puppet show with her puppets and

all the help of the waffle crew from the

reddit yes yes a maybe we've had some

lines that were collected from that and

we put it into the show and so the

purpose of this is to basically give you

a waffle crew sock puppet recap of where

the show is up to this point so if you

haven't been able to get on the waffle

crew train choo choo yes and you don't

necessarily want to look at 65 episodes

to get all cut up this puppet show

theater is going to basically cover all

that ground for you and tell you the

story of the waffle crew up to roughly

speaking the present so tune in next

week for that Horror Show I just threw

some wine so I've actually brought four

of this four of the socks here oh well

you guys are telling people things going

on in your lives and what they should

pay attention to you I will show off the

songs oh my gosh this is the palton sock

blonde hair and he's a little purple

from all the one's a little purple from

all the wine

hair and the red lips and the holy

symbol of lavender on her and then here

we got D F and he's wearing his leather

jerkin sorna and on the back that says

see more of them next week I didn't

realize it was gonna be that lot like
