and welcome to dice camera action and

for this week we've got guest star Sam

Sykes rejoining us for now hey Sam yeah

let's make this really good previously

in dice camera action a dark elf named

Cozens or Lauren convinced the waffle

crew to descend into the zenith r's lair

to kidnap the bee holders pet fish in a

daring maneuver to keep the beholder at

bay to control the bee holders mounting

aggressions against them when they got

down there they quickly triggered the

alarm

but not before paltin overheard this

Amitha are having a conversation with

some members of the Santarem trying to

smooth that road over before turning all

of his remaining ten eyes on vengeance

against the waffle crew vengeance

deserved at least in the zenith ours

the waffle crew and their companion Ben

win bronze bottom took out the zenith

our central eye the eye that he most

loved to look at his fish through so

here we are now in the zenith our Slayer

evylyn and Couzens are side by side

confronting the zenith r and his troops

which include a dwarf who think he's a

Minotaur and several bugbears evylyn has

made an attempt to shall we say quell

the beholder Zanger as much as possible

while her three intrepid friends head

off into the depths of the XANA thar's

lair to find the fish which DF and

palton have done the fish is contained

in a 20 foot diameter water-filled tank

a round tank in the middle of a large

room and we pick up now

in initiative order starting with the

rest of the beholder i-beams da wait

damn oh damn okay so do you know looking

into a large spacious room with this

giant fish tank a smaller fish tank on a

on a table next to it and swimming in

the giant tank amid coral reefs and a

miniature of a sunken galleon is the

gold scaled red tinged fish right and I

just take a moment to take in this room

could then look back at that sweet

trapdoor that I found yes and it'll

never let us never get to go through

yeah and then I'll go back to the task

at hand and Paul tonight so how tall is

this the aquarium and the fishbowl

itself because I'm imagining like so the

fishbowl is 20 feet in diameter okay so

it's it's massive right and it's about

16 feet high and bowl-shaped

okay so not typical I mean there goes

plan a now it's situated about five feet

from the nearest wall okay it's not dead

center in the middle of the room but

yeah that's a that's a ton of water okay

is there nearby step ladders or stools

or something that looks like they

probably used to put the feet in or

there's a way to reach the top basically

yeah you can as you poke around the room

you can see it's kind of oddly shaped

and there are corners and things that

you can look behind there is in fact a

stepladder tucked in a corner behind

just out of the out of view from the

door you came through but as you make

your way into the room you can see it

sort of behind the fish tank and it's

about it looks like it it's about 20

feet high

it's so tall I believe in you what you

got you got you got the climbs you got

the hops man you got this as you as you

look in the room too you can see that

not too far from there from that on one

wall is what appears to be a giant

mirror made out of sort of reflective

steel and so that's fine and you also

notice as you make your way into the

room that the wall opposite the mirror

and the stepladder has a hole in it

board through it at a height of about

ten feet off the ground it looks like a

beholder passage it's kind of tube

shaped mm-hmm leads away from the room

okay so then wait so he gets around his

Laird just through like hamster tubes

yep just like I wonder where that goes

so then the smaller Bowl that they place

them into for feeding yes what's that

one like so that's no like that's that's

Karia Bowl it's about like a two feet

across you could get your arms around it

okay and turn it so if the fish is in

there we can't carry the bull itself yes

it would it would be awkward but right

that's it cumbersome but yes doable okay

good work okay

[Music]

it's a big fish it's like a goldfish

it's like a trout right it's a carp so

it's a carp size the goldfish basic yeah

that changes a lot

yep so death will turn to palton and

just say a lot to do is quickly quietly

and cleanly right what do you got what

do you got what you said that it felt

like it felt like you had a plan to

follow that up with I mean ideas yes

plan get him in the ball get out right

no yeah duh that um how long can you

hold your breath Chris how long can I

hold my breath

Constitution 10 maybe a minute and that

are you trying to I be suggesting no

side side question how heavy are you

know under 3540 pounds

okay start to uh starting to hmm okay

I don't okay so I jump in there

I swim after it grab the fish underwater

swim out you think you think the fish is

open to ideas

by the way Jared the answer to your

magic question is with a content you can

hold your breath for one minute

yeah yeah bout a minute alright is the

smaller bowl already filled with water

yes okay great

alright so okay okay you guys have never

tried to not with our hands so after

death and polkan are standing there in

front of this big tank and they like so

so I'll just hold you by your ankles you

grab and I'll pull you out does a

terrible idea

well it's an idea do you have any kind

of food or anything on you do you think

a large goldfish would want to snatch up

you think it likes wine no no I don't

think so what if we just dump right into

the water

well that would kill it if you get the

fish drunk he might be more amenable is

what those in would say if he were there

yeah what the fish is drunk bad for for

what it's worth at least it'd be funny

oh boy

all right here I go death will take out

his rope from this pack okay and one end

of it Bolton say all right after I got

that on them you pull out got got it you

don't have like a hook or something no

no I don't so you just want to lasso

this thing out

yep deer picks up the other end I'm

getting there I'm gonna tie it around

them and then you beat him out I don't

see what could go wrong with this let's

do it start like going up the stepladder

and getting into position to like find

some way to get to the ball and as he's

doing like well if you got a better idea

you let me know we don't have a lot of

time

okay so DF pulls the ladder over next to

the fishbowl starts climbing up but with

the rope as he does palton make a

perception check oh good such a stupid

idea

Oh 12 okay cool I assume you're not

doing anything like this steady the

ladder you're just gonna let him take

care of that we're in an initiative

order I don't know what I can do okay

well what would you do given everything

that you know so far um actually no

you're right I would just watch okay and

as you're as you're kind of looking

around confident that DF can manage the

ladder on his own

you notice kind of peering out through

the doorway of a side chamber a stout

figure possibly a dwarf but you see

tentacles coming out of his head like

eyestalks like beholder eye stalks hmm

and he's just watching watching us yeah

there was some sort of scraping as the

ladder got moved into

and whatnot that mean or you're talking

they have attracted his attention kid I

say something too absolutely just like

hey just tank cleaners coming in routine

it's getting a little algae buildup in

here we just want to make sure this

thing's in good health D appears this

looks over at paltin and that looks over

where ya paltin is talking yet and then

just like freezes in place just make a

deception check good okay that is a 23

ok and then the figure withdraws I'm

just like Oh anyway carry on all right I

start climbing my way up to the top of

that bowl okay you get to the top of the

bowls tricks you are a couple you you

are a couple areas back in rat form

navigating your way down a curved

passage that's supported every 10 feet

or so by stone pillars course and these

stone pillars have the portland's fairy

fire okay fast on them I'm just trying

to find them so can I listen perhaps if

I can hear them sure thing okay I'm

gonna I'm gonna see if I can hear where

they're coming from because I am feeling

that they're not being stealthy at all

that's a 17 take advantage of that

paltin is not with your 17 you can hear

distantly their voices and they seem to

lead you to a doorway the door is open

and there's light spilling out and they

can creep to the edge of that doorway

using all of your movement and rath form

you can see an empty chamber that looks

almost like an audience chamber I'm

ratting and it's circular and tall

with two other doors leading off of it

one of which is closed and one of which

is open and the open one is where their

voices are coming from so there's kind

of one room between you and them and

that's this big empty audience chamber

okay I would like to walk along the wall

as a rat would okay and hug the wall

towards to where I hear their voices all

right I'm ready

okay as you make your way along the wall

the door that is closed across from you

opens now balls and to figure and this

this and this room you're in is lit so

you're not hidden in darkness as you put

across the wall coming through the room

crossing it literally almost heading

right for you but really more properly

heading for the door you just came

through our two creatures one is a dwarf

with goggles strapped to his head but

not over his eyes and he's got red hair

and a red beard that sort of braided

twice to create sort of this bifurcated

beard this for this beard fork shaped

beard he has an apron and leather

clothing and in his apron are all kinds

of tools and he's carrying a really

really big wrench then he just sort of

became this dragged or knocked against

the floor as he walks and he's just

making his way across floating about a

foot or so behind him is a small

spherical creature about the size of a

grapefruit

and you've seen this kind of creature

before it is like a mini beholder it's

got four little eye stalks with pink

eyes that are sort of looking all around

it as it floats behind the dwarf and the

odd thing about this one unlike the

other small beholder kins you've seen is

it's dark white it's an albino Oh

beholder Ken I mean I think that's cool

for like half a second but make a

stealth check I was gonna say I just

freeze and get as close to the wall as I

can and curse and rat

sixteen the dwarf is too wrapped in his

own murmurings and thoughts to pay you

any mind and if even if he did he

wouldn't really suspect a rat this place

would be infested with them but the

beholder is a little bit more wary and

looks around and the two of them go

right past you Oh

let out a ratty sigh I know and you

continue on okay okay

distraction force charisma edition you

guys are in the entry foyer with the

zenith are facing you on one side of the

foyer and the hoard of the the Minotaur

dwarf guy and maybe in the Goblin OIG's

behind you in the direction your friends

went and the zenith are well first of

all we're not technically an initiative

we're just having a conversation here so

evylyn you saw chosen take the brunt of

a laser basically why are you hurting

all of us it's so mean I thought you

were my friend let's have a long

discussion about it to which the

beholder says where are your friends I

know they're here what other friends

strict's paltin and the one i've come to

know and how is DF as much as I could

like check my locator watch for all this

I don't really just like keep tabs on

people I mean don't you have people to

do that you can see him grimace and kind

of bare his teeth and he says of course

I do

dozens are you sure could I see you them

he blinks intently and says I mean a lot

of people say they have tons of people

you know a lot of people I like my

people will call your people you know

but like who actually has people like

I'd love to meet your people you know

this is distraction force and he says

yeah so do you leave yeah I leave well

his before anyone can cool man thanks

okay it's fine this is where charisma

Edition kicks in all right so

evylyn goes in leaves your side you can

and then the zenith are says a miracle

with him evylyn changes tactics and she

kind of stops with the song and dance

but then she got hit like in the stomach

right yeah try basically intercepting

the beam

was intended for the Strix Ratan so she

just goes quiet and like kind of like

pulls aside like the ripped and burned

clothing and like just shows the wound

which I imagine is substantial it was

like a 54 HP whoo yeah and so she just

kind of like sadly looks at it and looks

dejected and like in pain like she's

going for the pity now oh okay you know

she was trying to just act it all out

but now everything is everything is

revealed and he just really hurt her you

know he says kind of with very very

little real empathy not being a creature

of empathy he says you think that's bad

and he says it hurts oh well she like

gets up real close and then she just

Pat's him on the top of the bald her

head it's like you poor thing can I roll

the performance check for that

absolutely oh man one why did I ask and

it was supposed to be like oh you poor

thing you poor thing or just what are

you winded when you went to touch them

she's like a hand touch and he says I

think I liked you better as a statue

that is very rude I think I didn't like

you can I try to stab him since I'm up

close to him let's roll initiative

because you're both thinking the same

thing you're both betraying each other

at the same

[Laughter]

supposed to fight it's ten okay so he

rolled a seven which means you get your

first attack or you're Taylor so I can

make it count

I want to just I want to go straight

through the empty eye socket with my

flame sword okay this is a horrific

image go ahead and make your attacks

can you guys bless bless my eye the guy

that Holly gave me : dice dice you guys

didn't bless it very hard I rolled a

seven which means I got a fifteen that's

as far as we can bless it I don't know

us the that does not hurt the beholder

okay well second attack yeah I guess the

the fluff is that she tried to stab you

but she was too close that time so kind

of like she couldn't get a good so she's

gonna take a step back and try one more

time two-handed just okay actually I'm

going to finally use this magical blest

die that Mustangs art sent me that she

said was blessed I've never rolled it

before this is important role oh god

she's watching right now please don't

crush her heart ah there we go

all right that's a 24 that's all right

so that is going to be oh and I'm gonna

use divine smite as well obviously

obviously so

is he a fiend he is not he is an

aberration okay some would say he has a

fiendish personality

oh he's more of a douchey personality

sorry let's try to pull some of this

 I did

divine smite at second level and did 40

damage 1414 Wow

okay he howls in pain at which point

Couzens you're out in the hallway with a

mare go Amerigo stops looks back and

says Amerigo go check on that yeah okay

he leaves you and returns to Zanna thar

well leave you by yourself where do you

go chosen once you're in this curved

hallway with pillars by yourself because

you know that that this hallway curls

around to the zenith arse audience

chamber and to where the fish is you

also know that there is a secret door to

your right that goes into some sort of

other magical area hasten them along I'm

still here to kill so figure I at least

not need me to make a go at it

so having assumed that they are at least

on their way to the fish yeah I will

start heading towards the fish okay tell

them about this latest uh business ok

then you're able to because you're a

very speedy guy get all the way to the

circular audience chamber and Strix you

can see chosen coming into the doorways

behind you oh actually a cozen when you

get up to the door you can hear the

sound of metal tapping against stone

like something being dragged across the

floor and or through a dark vision you

can actually see moving away from you

and oblivious to your presence is it

wharfing its small beholder floating

next to him uh he looks like some sort

of engineer all right and he's currently

not paying attention is not paying

attention to you at all all right I'm

gonna stick with the plan keep keep on

moving on if I see chosen yeah you do i

well I don't trust cousin nevermind I

know it's true but I mean she doesn't

necessarily trust everyone she makes

pies for but she'll still care give for

them special

all right the Zanna thar will look at

you evil in and first target you with a

ray I need you to make a wisdom saving

throw my my emoji shield has very angry

eyes okay yo RL works on yourself right

huh

your protection aura what I've already

got for that palden stuffs that work on

yourself first is saving I think it does

let me double-check when you or a

friendly creature yep thank you for the

reminder Darren nice don't want you to

die yeah I rolled really poorly - why am

i rolling these guys don't die don't die

let's see so con I have really high con

though so no it's wisdom wisdom wisdom

OOP 12 is not enough and he hits you

with a sleep ray so you fall asleep

great snaps and flutter flutter gently

down to the floor okay that's nice like

a little Disney Princess yep and

[Music]

let's see now make a dexterities make a

dexterity saving throw but because you

are currently unconscious your dexterity

saving throw you're just gonna get you

into a wall

unconscious blah blah blah drop in

holding automatically fails strength and

dexterity saving throws ok cool

fantastic yeah okay so nobody knows what

happens to evil him cuz she's by herself

now so let us briefly go back to paltin

and DF wacky hijinx oh boy the earth

you're standing at the top of the ladder

looking in the tank you can see that the

fish is d 'king in and out among the

sunken wreck in the coral reefs in the

lower third of the tank right make a

perception check okay do i yeah you see

that as well absolutely

twenty-two okay very good

you also see that there for the first

time now from a vantage point DF is

there is a treasure chest at the bottom

of this big tank look like a lost pirate

do I see not not from the floor now ah

it's kind of tucked away yeah if you're

the first act okay I guess I'm diving

into that fishbowl fishing after

swimming after this fish in hopes I can

somehow wrangle it up in my rope

underwater when your we go ahead are we

like okay could I do something are we

not in initiative over here or

technically not so yeah you can do

something simultaneously do I know what

it would eat yes I told you know that it

would eat fish food basically

could I miner illusion and create fake

fish food at the top of the at the top

of the tank you could yeah cool do you

want that I just was just asking if I

could I don't know I yeah all right so

you're creating fish food at the top of

the tank DF you're in the trunk swimming

around and everything looks distorted

outside of the tank of course if I had

the hell am i notice that

paltin made this fake fish food no

great all right

there's fish food then death comically

swims around in this fishbowl after a

large cold fish okay DF make a strength

athletics check does the fish food help

to grab all the fish doesn't seem to be

paying any attention to the fish food I

figured this would be the case that's

not bad

16 okay you swim after it and it's gonna

make a dexterity acrobatics check to try

to slip through your grasp and know it

fails you grab it and it's just like to

get that Holly poster worship yeah he

went down there and it tried to swim

away and just said just okay am i able

to tie it with the rope oh it out what

just throw it out of it you can't hear

me you just see Paul said just like

waving us I like try motion just yeah

uh-uh but I would I be able to swim

while still also holding a fish you can

you know kick your feet mmm you don't

need to have your arms necessarily free

to surface for sure

okay well yeah I can least you so how do

you that's a lot easier yours you got

your gloved hands around the fish you

think it'll be a simple task to Lariat

the fish with a rope yeah all right yeah

I'll start start kicking away get back

to this surface with the fish stupid all

right

paltin you want to do anything as he's

swimming back to the top of the fish

you're currently concentrating on your

spell I believe no I'm good here

all right then yeah if you break the

surface you've still got the fish in

your in your two hands and yeah and what

do you do next and then relation to me

hey throw efficient but so yeah there's

a smaller bowl below you next to this

big tank you can see it it's like it's

like a bat it's like playing basketball

you it's like a hoop like you you know

it's a good shot to try to get it in

there

can I like pick it up and like try to

like catch it where he throws it yes all

right yeah holding that up we can move

it so you can catch it okay from the

surface rub swimming I'm just gonna all

right the fish goes flying out of your

hands out of the tank and paltin Garrety

saving throw dexterity yeah Hiro's 17

all right you catch it in the tank it

lands I'm just like you worked make a

strength saving throw Oh

16 okay

it sort of slips a little bit let's make

three grass but you catch it on your

thighs basically and you manage to keep

the the bowl from smashing on the floor

oh my god we did it

so Strix have

arrived around Peaks your little rat

head around the corner of the room and

sees paltin because sort of stumbling on

the floor a little bit with this big

tank and a fish roiling around inside of

it all right I'm gonna undo my polymorph

so back to strikes you're straight and I

just look at I look at them and I say

hold on it's time to go can I cast my

word of recall yes you can

chosen you come up upon strix at this

time as she turns back into her normal

form and says those merry words when

constrict shows up immediately asks

where's evil and well we have to go get

evil it may be I think I don't know

isn't work can she just come to get the

touch her or something I don't how the

spell works you and up to five willing

creatures within five feet of you up so

we I'm still gonna teleport okay okay

well I'm just gonna go ahead and yeah

just like disappear I go invisible

no no well I'll go get her

well you're holding the fish at least

give me the fish I'm gonna polymorph the

fish then give me the fish what we'll to

into a smaller and more manageable fish

yeah it's it's only oh that's a great

make the bowl smaller no but doesn't

matter I'll put them in like I have

potion bottles I'll just put a tiny

little fish in the potion bottle and

cork it up so you're playing marks of

fish into a smaller more manageable fish

yes so that can just breathe air and go

on a bag okay okay I'm sorry okay

look into something that can breathe air

and go into a bag okay oh I I feel like

I should interject here like I can hear

them all that's a brilliant plan right

yeah let's go in here

yeah chosen I turn to cause I'm just

like the is that

I as they turn to the subject of evil in

I come in and say yeah about that um she

might be dead excuse me possibly yeah I

like I calmly set the bowl down

oh I wasn't there to see what happened

but as soon as I left there was the

sound of a fight I heard screaming

smiting and yeah things don't seem to be

going that well that's okay we'll go get

her also I'm gonna turn the fish into a

snail but but now hear me out you

currently have the B holders fish so you

hold the upper hand but if you polymorph

it into something else the fish

succeeded on that saving throw oh wow

damn they were all the naps real good

because like if you look you polymorph

it into not a fish then does an oath or

one believe you when you say you have

this fish well now I think that I don't

have magic because the fish I'm just

looking at my hands like I'm going to

let me see something

why don't okay why don't we tie up the

fish like a hostage in the bowl on his

little fish mouth and say if you you

don't give us even back the fish gets it

yes going to I'm gonna cast locate

creature to see if I sense evil one if I

may

Riggs is fashioning a fish gag out of a

piece of rope we're not gagging the fish

it's within a thousand feet of you so

that's a good distance that'll cover

probably the entirety of the zennith

ours Larry you do not detect evylyn hmm

what

well that's person not creature its name

a creature that is familiar dating a

persons not a creature yeah it is

oh okay creature would normally detect

evil in if she's in his outer layer I

was really hoping that that wasn't the

case so all this just god damn it Jenny

death get herself out of the fishbowl

please you sort of slide off them that

sounded like skin against correct glass

and of course you're soaked you're just

like oh yeah just don't like it's like

floppy hair strokes will

prestidigitation you clean and dry Oh Oh

who's already running back yeah you're

clean and dry now halten is relieving

palton is leaving the scene right nope

he's going okay he bolts past you the

way he came evens in trouble you have to

go well that seems like I mean I get

sure we got a but that was a little

brash but yes no no sound no fish now

they should still with them yeah well uh

nope Alton's gone but the fish is still

here we have to take the fish I'm going

to I'm going to polymorph the fish into

the snail wait wait what I like Cozens

idea so close because show this he won't

attack us or harm us not without putting

the fish in harm's way fine if

something's wrong with evylyn then

that's our final bargaining chip all

right you and I will carry the fish then

yes as fast as we can and cozen you can

help us by staying stealthy and being a

drow you got it you got it

how's that that sounds brilliant is that

a plan did I just make a plan amazing

Chris am i there yet okay yeah since

you're going pell-mell

back so when you get back to the hallway

with the pillars you see that it's

completely dark again because your

verifier has expired but you kind of

know the way you're going um you've been

you've been down this hallway before so

you can run through it in the dark and

[Music]

as you do let's see I'm still invisible

yeah you are still invisible yes cool so

you see at the end of the hall a group

of creatures coming in your direction

from the opposite direction

and the only reason you can see them is

because one of them is carrying a

lantern and he's a figure he's a human

okay and so he sort of he is lighting

himself and two of his companions who

were also both humans they are

accompanied by the zenith are mm-hmm who

is using an array to levitate evylyn who

is a statue and she's a statue of

herself sleeping cool I'm good you can

see that there are a number of goblins

and bug bears and also that dwarf with

horned helmet present cool

so as invisible and icy statue even I

want to walk right up to the zenith or

if I can can I get to him yeah he's just

sort of walking or surrounded by his

goblin oins and and the dwarf and and

his guests these ant Arum human agents

but you're invisible you can easily get

up to this anetha in your present

invisible condition cool

so no logic I'm running on pure rage

right now I just walk up to him and I'm

gonna cast a level six under wave on him

okay okay now are you true basically

just trying to get him like kind of

blasting upward or are you gonna try to

get as many of his minions as possible

in the process um whatever would be I

don't I don't even know okay so probably

done from you then and we'll say you'll

get some X number of randos in the blast

okay

roll your damage what's the day's the

save DC 17 all of you can hear the

Thunder Clap of paltin spell yeah time

to go okay okay

there's Anitha rolled a roll the six on

his saving throw cool and I'm gonna say

you're gonna catch three goblins to bug

bears and all of the centaurum dudes in

the blowhole alright so let's see

alright now first and then add them like

we all hear this and you just think

Strix Andy they're just holding this

fishbowl running as fast they can go

nope bad bad bad

[Music]

34 hello okay added to the 40 points of

damage that the zenith hair is just

taken from Evelyn and alright so this

goes off you are now visible standing

amid these enemies but three or sorry

two goblins go flying back and get

hurled up against the back wall and just

fall dead to the floor you know so try

and catch the statue if I see it falling

three three bugbears

they are not blasted back but they take

half damage each and are all wounded and

then these ents two of them are blasted

back and killed and the third one

holding the lantern his his Lantern

glasses all smashed out the lights go

out in the hall completely leaving you

in the dark and then you hear this

Anitha fly back 10 feet end over end his

telekinesis ray shuts off and evil and

statue falls to the floor

it is dark you can't see do you want to

try to break her fall yes okay a great

plan make a dexterity saving throw at

disadvantage because we can't see her or

team okay you lunge and you hear a

smashing noise on the floor and you find

yourself

hurling onto a pile of debris why he got

a run on emotions and now I've need

everybody to roll initiative because all

of Paul tendons foes can see in the dark

except it wasn't hard so I'm sorry I

started it

I can see in the dark yes hang on it are

we still in the hall you are you're

basically in the audience chamber okay

hold on everybody roll initiative okay

white text is evil it

oh no well I'm assuming I don't need to

roll initiative not at the present time

now yeah okay Strix what was your

initiative 1818 DF

17:17 paltin 1818 chosen well 12 okay so

after the thunderous blast we'll start

with you halten what would you like to

do next after you've thrown yourself on

to the rubble pile so I can't see

correct

I'm going to I'm just gonna call out to

the Zanna thar yeah I'm gonna tell them

we have your fish fix her stand

down and it lives all right mm-hmm

I like the you added swears yeah since

you're basically trying to alter his

course of action make it intimidate

mm-hmm I'll give you advantage because

you mentioned to the fish and you are

coming from the direction of the fish 19

okay and all right do you want to do

anything else besides that like move or

anything or would saying that if

countered as my action or yes oh well

then let's go ahead and just click a new

tab right here

yeah I'll move away okay you can use

your son sword to see you could activate

an item last nods in action never mind

yeah damn I'm just gonna kind of if I

can get a feel of where might be safe or

you can't get a feel of it

you're in the midst surrounded by

enemies as far as you can tell okay I'm

just gonna lay low okay

Strix you heard the blast yeah then you

you probably heard and paltin just yell

out what he just yelled out to the

zenith our this ultimatum okay well we

have to get I'll just look at D it so

you'll I guess we have to get the fish

there yeah it doesn't even say anything

he just keeps moving in that direction

okay well we're holding the bowl

together yes it's big

so we'll just go towards Paul Tim my

initiatives I think it's right after

yours so let's go yeah so what's up with

the fish last I heard it saved against

your spell it did oh it's still a fish

it's still fish in fish ball being

carried my death ins tricks got it so

the two of you are managing this

fishbowl and it's sort of sloshing back

and forth the fish looking startled as

it's being brought forward the two of

you enter or leave the audience chamber

entered the dark hall Strix you can see

in the dark DF alright i polymorph my

staff into the lantern the green lantern

your staff is never green lantern

casting its glow baleful glow down the

hall where you see the zenith are kind

of lying lying on its back or side and

just kind of like reorienting itself and

then some bugbears standing around a

little in shock but but bringing their

weapons almost to bear down on paltin

who is lying atop the shattered remains

of evil and I can tell it's evylyn you

yeah yeah you can tell because there's

like there's like a little petrified

wing to boot okay does that count do I

know if that counts as a body no I don't

know if it does or not it's now a

collection of objects so that would be

that there is no body correct it's a

collection of objects okay well I'm

going to ignore that knowledge okay you

also see that there's one human last

anywhere with the broken room

of a lantern that's gone out and he

you've seen him before

outside of chair con you cornered him

and let him go he's basically isn't

armed operative okay well if she is a

collection of objects then um all right

well we have the fish I'm just gonna put

my hands like on the fishbowl and just

pretty much like ready a fireball okay

so like I want like to like look

intimidating and like well I'm holding

this fishbowl and just say oh my god

Nate brought back alcohol I'm holding

this fishbowl I'm just gonna like CI

because paltin is obviously trying to

intimidate him yeah and just say you

know he's right we have your fish if you

don't tell us what tell it save our

friend or and leave us alone I will boil

it alive I'm holding it like this okay

Wow you owe me to intimidate check go

ahead sure okay can I have advantage

does I'm holding the fish actually I'm

gonna say no because you used your

action to turn your staff into a lantern

okay okay so I don't intimidate okay yes

but you're kind of working on the

intimidation the groundwork that paltin

has already put forth exactly yeah I see

what he's doing and I'm trying to help

absolutely d/f mm-hmm you want to take

any action at this point you've moved um

yeah I guess I'll just follow up from

strix --is negotiation and yeah also

just say that you will let us leave and

you will never ever do anything to us

ever again not to us not the children

not to anyone that is important to us

you will leave us alone then and only

then will you get sold our back

all right Chozen yeah

so when they take off running with the

fish yeah ice cream right behind you and

then I play so it sounds like I'm right

before ight and then once they're gone I

 off presumably going to hunt around

the lair for an aural Oh No okay so do I

know I know the way out

yeah the way out is the way out is

through the zenith are at the moment oh

but but there are other there are other

avenues there's the door that the dwarf

and his albino gazer came through that

door is open to you

there's also out in the hall other

passages that branch off of that curved

hall that you could explore any one of

those do I have a vague idea of which

one leads towards me based on

intelligence I don't have you make an

intelligence check I'm gonna give you

advantage because you were given

intelligence about this place okay prior

to you showing up

so we're twice and take the higher

result add your intelligence mod I got a

16 great you recollect that probably the

best exit for you is through the arena

now there's a there's a door off of this

curved hall that leads down leads to a

flight of stairs that lead down to the

the audience portion of a circular

chamber that serves as an underground

Fight arena and out of that arena are

other passages that lead out to a place

called skull port an underground

Haven old pirate Haven deep deep below

water deep alright

well perfect perfect for a drow such as

you to lose yourself yeah no I mean this

plan is gone to and you know the

fish thing was always a long shot so you

know I take a moment reflect on what I

could have done differently and then I

start heading out that way okay you slip

down the stairs closing the door behind

you

leaving the waffle crew to their to

their doom you think next time I guess

when you get to the arena

it's a magically lit circular chamber

with a thin layer of blood-soaked

sand covering the floor and the stone

there are buttresses that support its

40-foot high domed ceiling and then

there are these 10-foot high stone

bleachers that hug half of the room

these this sort of hemisphere of

bleachers that's what you sort of come

out onto the top of those bleachers

right and there are two tunnels leading

off of it there's also a tunnel

underneath you that you believe leads to

like a prison detention area now this

room that you have entered is not

currently empty

oh there there are two or three

creatures in the room on the sandy floor

below you okay one appears to be a

halfling dressed or sort of wearing a

two bard with the symbol of the zenith

are kind of painted on it okay and you

see that that halfling is wearing a hood

to hide her face and just has eyes

peering out through eye holes and she's

got a leather leather leather armor that

she's wearing she's also got a scourge

and she sort of snaps it and is ordering

two combatants to basically hurl

themselves at each other and tells them

to basically put their

backs into it stop stop stop being

goofballs and put on a real fight the

Zanna Thor wants a good show the two

creatures that are fighting in the pit

are both big one is a Minotaur okay the

other is a hippo man a giant burly man

they're about the same size and they're

they're having at it and the hippo man

says come on man bring it let's see what

you've got your own theme fisticuffs yes

time for fisticuffs and they're

basically punching each other's lights

out all right and none of them noticed

me that's right I mean you hit like a

beauty school child okay I'm just gonna

keep on keepin on sounds good

make a stealth check 18 okay you all as

you're making a way stealthily and

they're not paying much attention to you

also see what appears to be one of those

scrying sensors coming down from the

ceiling but it doesn't notice you either

as you glide silently through the

shadows of the room to the other exit I

feel like if I set that off it might

help cover my escape more and also its

wind but then these guys might you

refrain

you're welcome remember this if I ever

get to come back just remember their

fourth wall knowledge no problem oh yeah

Paulding by now has taken out a paper he

keeps on this person just wrote cozen

all right and so you slip out

the Minotaur and the gift to their

fisticuffs yeah groovy done and done the

beholder takes to the air once more

focuses its eye stalks at the tank with

the fish in it it makes a desperate

maneuver

I would like DF and Strix to make a

strength saving throw as he tries to

telekinesis the tank out of your grasp

we're not good at that collectively he's

trying to he's trying to individually

each of you gets to make a dexterity

saving through or sorry strength

strength strength saving through damn

damn to try to hold on to the tank that

the beholder is trying to rip from your

clutches I'm just gonna not look I got

15 I got an 11 he rips the tank from

your grasp okay and floats it toward him

no can you would they encounter spell

able I don't think so that's an i-beam

it's not nice

those are great good good features well

balanced thanks great um can I just

yo we poisoned him sure

DF will just say loudly enough said both

tricks and the XANA Thor can hear it I'm

just say well he didn't listen Strix

fireball it and poison okay when you say

that it's still the be holders turn yeah

I can I can hellish rebuke it hasn't

attacked you yet I always get that wrong

[Laughter]

it is going to that

use another IRA on you since you were

carat since you were good enough to

share your plan he'll target Strix fine

just kill me at this point

okay wisdom saving first wall just kill

me you know that my I probably be

happier in hell well that's a nine okay

you are struck by the fear ray and must

on your turn get as far away from the

zenith are as possible I mean and well

it's even more sad because she just like

looks around and looks super scared like

when dia first met her zennith are will

then fix one of its eye stalks on you

palton it's used up its its array

ability for the time being but it looks

at you with one of these eye stocks and

then just says to you can't contra spell

that can you

[Laughter]

he just looks back at him I've seen your

character saying I've seen you in

the shower he looks back at he looks

back at the xanthe or he's just like I

want to rip each of your eye stalks off

and sell them as sex toys buddy

[Laughter]

related wizards if you're listening it

got a great idea for a new product line

alright and then it is the zenith

Armenians turn and they are going to try

to grapple and apprehend you paltin so

let's see the bugbears

just dogpile on you basically make a

strength athletics or a dexterity

acrobatic

ooh let's go with man I have to choose

between the plus two and the plus 12 I

think we're gonna go acrobatics yeah

that is a dirty 20 okay one of them

tries to get his mitts on you but really

can't then the goblins they just sort of

keep their distance they don't interfere

in the battle until the zennith are

commands them to and he hasn't done so

yet the Zen Tarim guy who's still alive

he is going to try to just attack you

okay

since here since he has allies all

around you he's better at this cause

he's an assassin oh good for him yeah so

he makes two short sword attacks missing

with one but rolling 22 to hit with the

other one that attack is going to do

seven points of piercing damage plus 14

points of sneak attack damage plus 24

points of poison damage so 24 + 14 is 38

+ 7 is 45 points of damage totaled okay

so with that something I didn't realize

I had forever now I'm going to use my

reaction and then cutting words and

you're still alive right yes absolutely

right

uh so using my Bartok inspiration it

says roll the die and subtract the

number from the creatures roll so what

I'm not sure what it means by the die

it does not specify it says as a

reaction when a creature you can see

then 60 feet of you makes an attack roll

ability check our damage roll you can

expend one you oh wait so it's probably

my Bartok inspiration so hey so that be

a d-10 so yeah big difference

there oh that is a 10 ok cutting words

mm-hmm

so it's my so it's this yeah it's the

same guy that's taking off the attack

yeah it says off the damage

it says makes an attack roll ability

check or damage roll okay paulie's

probably stuff like you're an unnamed

NPC just like you're just data that I'll

be forgotten by next episode alright so

his his assassinating attack he's struck

to the core by your cutting words and it

throws him off his game and prevents you

never get in that race from piercing

your your flesh yay good job huh

yes heroes way better than what 40 hell

yeah

cool all right so that's the bad guys

turn oh I forgot Amerigo our resident

dwarf who thinks he is a Minotaur he is

gonna come at you too and I guess I'm

gonna swing twice with his great X coz

you know heck oh ok so he rolled a 26 on

the first attack which will do wait

who's this on this is on you palmed oh

okay he's he's you you attacked the

beholder so he's got to put on a show

here and attack you back this this

horned helmet worn out will be 16 points

of slashing damage plus 7 points

slashing damage because he's got a lot

of points so that would be a total of 23

points of slashing damage from the first

swing cool from the second from the

second swing

he actually crit you within that 20 and

unless my cutting words can I reaction

again no because you've used your one

reaction for attorney cool well would

have been nice to know I was gonna get

attacked 7 times this turn so 14 19

another 26 points of damage

cool alright how you looking I look I've

looked worse yeah the bad guys are done

and Colton it's your turn

you see that the beholder currently has

the fishtank levitated about 15 feet up

in the air nearby and he he sort of

looks at the fish lovingly to make sure

that it's okay because after strict said

they they poisoned it he's duly

concerned I'm going to cool so I'm

hurting a lot wow this is fun

having a great time right now I'm how

far is he from me oh not far like tops

10 feet cool how's he looking so right

now he is you would say if not bloodied

very very close to bloodied so he's lost

about half his hit points

I'm gonna tell them let's see I'm I

talked to him real quick I'm gonna tell

him I already warned you once we have

your fish stand down I point to the pile

okay people and I'm like fix that and

the fish lives right here me and I go

you have what you think is the fish he

looks at it with his eye several of his

eyestalks very closely I'm pretty sure

it's the fish secretly cause I will turn

a couple eyes toward you and say I point

two strikes is still here right yep

I pointed 17 intelligence 14 which is

higher like it's not about me it's about

her we have an expert polymorpha here he

looks over your shoulder at they panic

induced strix I'm trying to defeat him

the Strix is like pulling on our clothes

and looks at her and says intelligence

15 I think I'm smart so what is that

just a no on deception then yeah okay

cool well anything I'll see you like

that well that wouldn't have been my

action would it you're just talking okay

and I'm like all right well uh Soul

it then yeah I'm gonna thunder wave them

[Laughter]

alright

that's gonna hit the fish good this

fish you can and you have the option of

not hitting the fish but if you want to

hit the fish you can in the black I want

to hit the fish the most okay of course

you do

all right these adventures are made for

people that planned things right all

right go ahead okay you see they

voluntarily closed all of his eyestalks

like he's he knows the blast is coming

hmm good rules though unless I just

paste it oh boy okay Cohen every

retreating into the depths of the XANA

thar's lair you hear another big boom

sound 3900 okay

he is definitely well and truly bloodied

at this point and the fish tank explodes

a shower of water follows the fish goes

flying back through the air does anetha

half of that damage and is not blasted

back but you see as his he can take as a

reaction on his turn and I an i Rea

attack after another creature

we're sorry it's another one it's a look

he can take a legendary action after

your turn oh cool normally he'd send

that I Rea after one of you but after

the fish goes flying through the air he

uses the Irate to try to catch the fish

with his telekinesis right the fish net

20 resists it and he succeeds in

catching the fish before it hits the

floor and immediately he goes

we have to get you back into your deck

and and as my bonus action as Chad had

pointed out I'm going to take out the

Sun sword assuming I still have that

because I'm having a hard time keeping

track of this timeline I have it you

have this yes you have the sword hilt

cool and it says chat says the bonus

action can be activated it's more for

Flair to be fair okay sure so I just

kind of do it just kind of Jedi I told

you last chance this is your last chance

Java yeah you gonna bill your cloak at

the same time yep all right

crazy billowing of the cloak and he

actually it's not quite as turn yet but

you can see the fear in his eyes as you

light your sword and billow your look

what's left of them yes and he says when

did you get the cloak isn't on your

character sheet and he he looks

concerned all of a sudden it is now

Strix his turn Strix you are overcome

with fear do we get a save on that or no

nope oh cool well I mean this is a

normal feeling for me so I'm just like

yes as being a frightened creature

that's me yes what you here's what the

frightened condition says you have

disadvantage on ability checks and

attack roles while the source of your

fears within line of sight and you can't

willingly move closer to the source of

your fear

you can repeat the saving throw at the

end of each of your turns alright so I

am going to try and polymorph the fish

again okay I am NOT gonna move closer

but I'm gonna try and polymorph the fish

again okay and I want to polymorph it

into something like a butterfly okay you

turned it into something like a

butterfly haha

and it still kind of snared in his

telekinesis beam but then he does Anitha

looks at it goes Wow

stop doing that

and this tricks is good doesn't like it

it's just gonna yell how do you know if

it was him all along I'm afraid all

right I could just say if I get to roll

my safe yes you do that's an 11 okay

yeah the fear has still taken hold okay

well yeah what do you do

no no man you see palton standing over

broken evylyn with his laser sword out

and his cloak billowing dramatic even

cooler the rubble of evylyn at his feet

oh are you cool yeah it's so rad cool

for fan art wink this has been sense

just gonna make me sad um okay so to get

everything caught up silver is now a

butterfly yes flying in place yes

because it's still under like the

telekinesis there are several bugbears

and goblins still alive but not acting

at the moment there's also a the dwarf

at the horned helmets been attacking

palton and mauling him with his great

axe oh that guy still there oh yes he is

an ever-present threat to pollens

existence

oh I'm sorry I should have fireballed

everyone but I just feel like we're

going to Paris also as ant assassin

who's threatening Paulding yeah great

so that's butterfly class is shattered

Alton's pest so when something is in a

telekinesis spray is it like a is it

basically like a a strength contest to

try like pull something out of a race

area

okay got it all right then

I want to get us out of here DF is also

feeling just very unnerved right now

because with the fear cast on Strix he's

seeing her in ways that he hasn't seen

in years now it's just and he also knows

she won't go any closer to the be older

than she is now yeah I just kill him but

you've got dudes on you called me Paul

just doesn't care like he's getting

mauled by like everything around him but

his eyes are just like set on his answer

it's like just kill this thing

how hard is it to attack a butterfly not

terribly hard okay um I'm I don't know

why I did that

scared Strix is dumb holy Christ

this is terrible and I hate it I don't

know how to I can't really sneak attack

Zanna thar as I don't have an ally

within 5 feet so it'd just be alright a

pitiful death attack so I wouldn't

really do much right so attacking him is

not a good idea

so I guess what I'd like to do is

yeah I'm gonna try to sneak attack the

assassin who try attack tried to attack

paltin okay

and ideally one shot it right that just

happens right okay okay it's pretty good

attack though yes 21 inch from Paulson's

thunder wave first time okay that helps

alright so 21 just on him that hits all

right get on my few sixes cuz I'm I'm

mostly just trying to get this guy out

of the way yeah okay now that's too many

ones so DF leaps up how's that this guy

and this guy is sort of a kind of a

grimy shady dark figure with the tragg

old black hair and a scruffy black yeah

so basically I walk up and like just got

by the shoulders like blade right into

his back for a 30 30 points yes okay I'm

still alive but haha I'm greatly wounded

dammit

and then with that Bob basically pull

cutter out and then move past them and

bring the bloody gutter up next to that

butterfly okay just be like I will you

hold the little goddamn rings wings off

now you know that those anetha are can

easily just move the butterfly out of

your grasp given a chance right which is

with the sword there there's a thread a

me just mean like true understand just

trying to just trying to all right so

you threaten your butterfly cast wet

just do it be zennith are already attack

the

we'll then use another legendary action

to use an IRA at the end of your turn

dear

bye fam I need you to make a wisdom

wisdom saving throw let me check

something just very quickly here oh you

need dexterity did you mean that can we

just leave today's been going really bad

I just want to go home

strikes yells as she stares at a wall do

what he needs

so do you make a constitution same

address no no stop looking at my

character sheet sorry slightly better

[Laughter]

[Applause]

this is important

I would like to use human determination

forever did she good call if that was

not like oh yeah Sam where you're gonna

die within the first we better uh you

said Constitution right yes please all

right nineteen okay you resist his

paralyzing ray you're still able to move

your limbs despite his attempts to

freeze you in place yeah and he will

just move the fish out of your reach

it's fine he'll actually move himself

out of your reach as well he will fly up

near the ceiling so he's about twenty

feet off the floor

at a polymer I can I can still hit that

butterflies okay and that brings us to

cozen who is but loose and fancy free

cause of you continuing your merry Trek

toward skull court

alright everyone in chat is saying that

DF gets an opportunity attack if he

flies away he was never actually

adjacent to the beholder but the

butterfly so I will let I will actually

allow you to make an opportunity to talk

against the butterfly Diaz if I choose

to do so if you choose to do so evil

ones watching from the movie theater

next to Arabella popping up god damn it

no I'm not attacking it okay then he'll

move safely away with sill guard

terrible and evil and look at each other

like comas and you'll eventually emerge

up through the basement of a place

called the guts and garters in a

ramshackle hole of an inn basically in

the heart of skull port and then I

inherit the end from my late uncle

begins in trouble they called the chosen

girls oh no about me and three sassy

retirees alright and so now we are back

to the be holders regular turn to do

[Laughter]

palton make a Xterra tea saving through

okay

twenty-one okay you are you dodged that

disintegration ray oh I know that one it

leaves a hole in the in the floor where

you were where you left out of the way

assassin has turned his focus toward DF

okay how far is the door from me he's

right next to you okay cool so and how

far up is 20 feet yeah cool let's see

leavin a sweet sound from mm-hmm let's

do there anything I could step on to

like go up five feet up five feet yeah

there's some like corpses something

around that you could probably leap up

on with that I'm both Evelyn into a

little rubble pie you could do that and

weep off her paltin says the Sammy's

like it's evylyn like how many deaf

people to like put his hands together to

do that basically like yeah okay I just

want to make sure I could get within

five feet of the zanaffar and again

Thunder Wave oh I see yeah and then

thunder wave him in the air okay cool I

would like to do that all right dude so

he's got like the cloak of billowing the

Sun sword drawn and he like walks up in

slow-mo on 2d so that is a again that's

a 17 ok thanks for him yep you'll also

get the fish or a butterfly as it were

if you so choose what you do yep and

then go ahead and roll your damage the

lar failed it's saving throw what all

right big money

okay and then how many am i doing now it

is okay okay so 28 28 points of damage

Wow okay alright

Santa Thor is looking more hurt silg are

butterfly is sort of bowl iterated turns

from a butterfly into a fish and then is

obliterated as a fish and nothing left

remains and you just hear this audible

gasp

paltin superhero lands yellowing and the

sword out he just has a slow look up he

goes you had your last warning

you are so dead I'll see you there

alright next up is Strix alright as soon

as I see the butterfly fish get up

literally and I'm just like well alright

resigning

I also castigated okay and I already

rolled and it was 46 all right

the zennith are failed I guess we're

doing this all right we don't have our

bargaining chip anymore the assassin

succeeded and takes no damage what an



he too has evasion the dwarf rolled a

natural one and takes it all and all of

the bug bears and goblins are

incinerated so how much damage was that

again

the 41 was it's 46 thank you oh the

zenith our looks extremely hurt is

smoldering up there screaming at the top

of his lungs and it is I also like to

imagine that fire is erupting from the

sewers again you've attacked since the

assassins gone so it's actually the

assassins turn yeah I think this asked

him okay he disengages and flees double

doors taking off running like the

he is running for the escape hatch he

disappears leaving you with the beholder

and Amerigo the dwarf Amerigo the dwarf

even though he took the full brunt of

that fireball looks like he's got a

ton of hit more hit

points left great he he he just sort of

readjusts his his horned helmet goes

after Oh who's the most dangerous paltin

any moment he'll go after you he rolls

on the die at 25 to hit which will Paul

- yeah

you take you take 35 points of slashing

damage cool I'm gonna cutting words

again okay also unrelated I did my fear

save and got a 19 great thank you

it's alright you know they're afraid yay

how much damage was it well this is

against the attacker alright no it's

against the damage of damage I'm sorry

um

so that would be 35 okay - 7 so that's

28 hole that saved me okay second attack

okay well here's a Miss with a twelfth

oh okay the beholder is going to go

after death

oh the way alton literally like covered

in blood actually the beholder has a

legendary action you can use after a

mayor goes turn was going to use it

right now but he doesn't have to is just

yelling like attack me i don't care i

don't want to be alone for 50 years

again please just kill me it'd be easier

[Music]

[Laughter]

and he says if it makes des life

miserable then I'm all for it and he

will turn array on you Strix make a

dexterity saving throw a purple game

Lance's down the hallway at the teeth

league oh that's a seventeen Roy 17 yeah

okay you get out of the way oh he he

rolls his death ray at you and it

I pay myself a little all right

yeah yes the moment that Ray goes after

his tricks and she dodges out of the way

Giff pulls up moon splinter

Missy steps behind Santa thar and stabs

him so you could say that with

advantages or animal attack what do you

think advantage great surprise even that

was on my character sheet it was new

though yeah 18 it that's exactly what

you need oh that's good because the

other die was a - oh there's only one

one in here so looking good

Oh also when he attacked me can i

hellish rebuke him that is a saving

throw not an attack no sorry I'll keep

asking JEP please do that's 39 you kill

the beholder and it falls I want I want

his eyepatch to like have a sword come

out of it a shot but yeah it's your

blade just sort of shoots out yeah yeah

and then back to your hand like my whole

hands in there and then like when it

feels body go limp it's like lifting his

sore and just like prop you to the

ground like a like something stuck to

your hand just yes it just hits the

ground with a splat and lands there dead

all of its eyestalks fall limp to its

sides and at that point in time Amerigo

just clutches drops his axe clutches his

helmet goes no I've done it

I'm the zenith are now the the dwarf

looks at you and takes off his helmet

and kneels before you you are Janna Thor

now he's not smart Paul and drops to his

knees and just goes

you did it he finally became the Hokage

kids tricks it run up to evil in and try

to use her mending can't rip on her one

piece at a time

haha there are so many pieces of evylyn

that you would have to use you have to

use multiple spells to sort of bring

each piece well at first it's a jigsaw

puzzle because you're like okay but

doesn't work you grab one piece that

looks like it attaches to another piece

you cast the spell and those two pieces

do fuse together it works so this will

take a while but it'll work dead so you

guys wrong place Zenith ours dead long

live Zenith are why don't you guys loot

the place while I put evil and back

together I actually will go up to what

was the door stained I'm sorry I'm air

to go and just be like you will go to

the treasure halted immediately fetch us

a true resurrection scroll no no we

don't need that it's fine once I put her

together all we need is to take her the

temple get stone to flesh then she's

back to flesh I don't think she's dead

yet Strix trust me on this one go to the

hold and find his dub fine finest the

most valuable looking scroll there tell

no one of your mission or what has

happened here

now go yes sir I trust you with this I'm

ergo your most trusted lieutenant he

puts his helm on and stomps off down a

passageway great he's out of here

mending mending mending mending is like

put pieces together

she's like does this look like Evelyn's

eyeball yeah

one of you can assist the other in an

intelligence check to sort of try to

piece evylyn together properly oh wow

since she's mending 16 okay yeah let's

go with that

yeah you're piecing here together it's

just gonna take a tremendous amount of

time and patience to get her go Strix

can you get us out of here what do you

want to sweep up all the pieces of evil

in first or yeah no way to put her

together first well whatever it is it

takes to make sure that she comes with

us

I will do that but why don't you go loot

everything in here there's like stuff no

while you're doing that I'll be right

back you love stuff no charge your chest

stuff you know whatever's are those

other snacks and those I don't know and

she's like pushing the pieces it's not

stuff that I love snacks look I'll be

back

all right I'm returning back to that

fishbowl but I found there's a treasure

chest inside as your way make your way

back there you see that there is a door

open that wasn't open before and a

booming voice issues from it and says

this isn't a pillow fight hit me like

you meant it oh god damn it I I know

that's coming from yeah it's coming from

that doorway okay well a priest

restriction get him out - oh God yep yep

we'll get him too in just a moment I

want that treasure chest you go back to

the fishbowl and then I'll just ice

shattered open that bull I don't care at

this point so you're gonna just like

pick up the step stool or a ladder just

can't let all the water to pull out

something is this chest by the way you

bash this an awkward ladder up against

the wall the glass wall of the fishbowl

realized that the glass wall is stronger

than it looks well damn also full of

water they don't care about the water

part yeah but well makes it I guess all

the stuff insides probably well

like I can breathe underwater well how

big with the chest was it like it's a

normal sized chest okay now like a

little lockbox or anything now

okay well dang

let's take my rope swim in there tight

around the treasure chest get a bubble

and then pull his chest right out okay

so you climb up on the ladder you dive

into the chest with the rope you tie the

rope around the chest handles yeah and

then you come back out and then once

outside on the ladders you really you're

able to pull the entire chest up and out

it's heavy work but you're able to do it

okay good now it's on the top of the

ladder with you dripping wet great I'm

gonna give this a quick once-over and

make sure it's it's safe than good and

not not trapped or anything or make a

perception check for traps know nothing

about it is like real live I'm reading

chat and they're like I can't believe

they live I'm like thanks guys I mean

you can't believe you said perception

perception precise reliable reliable

tale at 21 okay you don't believe the

chest is trapped okay it's it's not like

a mimic or some either

no all right all right I'll open open

this up all right

you crack open the chest or make a just

dexterity checked open with your

lockpicks Oh mm-hmm

you got it Chris oh 28 wait I'm sorry 32

third do you pop it open easily and

inside you can see it's stuffed full of

precious gemstones at first glance it

looks like also something may have

rested on top of the gemstones at one

point there's an indentation there but

whatever object it was is missing Oh

weird uh you sort of do you sort of dig

around you know maybe you look for

secret compartments yeah I also want to

collect up as made gems as possible you

can you can see there's at least

30 of these gems and based on your

instant appraisal you think there might

be worth about a hundred gold each so

this is like a three thousand gold piece

trove you've just found okay that's a

small drop in the bucket but you also

see that there is a secret compartment

you're able to pop open the back of the

chest and can see inside there is what

appears to be a wand and a scroll tube

perfect good treats for the others I'm

gonna take those two okay and then yeah

after getting all that collected up I'm

gonna retreat back to Strix and paltin

as fast as possible okay you still hear

sort of fighting coming from down that

staircase yeah I want to get to that

that's basically so you get back to them

as soon as I get back to them like

assess how much they put even back

together and then I say guys Warrington

once here and we have to save him - OH

Paulin still just trying to like put

pieces together he's like yeah that that

looks like that matches okay she put

both of her ears on backwards and she's

like she's like they're pretty tied

up right at the moment DF they seem all

holy interested in evilly it's like it's

it's not actually her it's just a puzzle

that like you know unlocks her like dad

again like you just got it all right

just just keep working on it I'll go

back for Warrington whatever that is

okay so that's it I think I thought it

was a okay well you know it could be

either or let's just play a thumb okay

how about we set it aside and see if

they find in those oh I'm gonna start

marking them with numbers take my quill

that's good okay so before I actually go

back for a Warrington I'm going to take

I'm gonna take the corpse of design I

thought with me that's huge I mean

ok never mind that I can fix what the

hell they're massive how can we watch

him struggle for a little bit the big

beholder you like grab it by that I saw

you just rip a nice knock that's like

bulbs can you save a few of those I have

a business idea yeah depth it takes me

you want yeah I'm going from going for

where I heard goddamn boring ttan run

down a staircase and into an arena and

on the blood-soaked sand you see lying

splayed out spread-eagle staring up at

the ceiling an unconscious Minotaur and

standing over the Minotaur cracking his

knuckles is Warrington Mundt and he and

he's like I'm the crowd goes wild

there's no one watching it's just them

fighting yeah yeah the fights over at

this time there is a halfling who is

there

I'm standing with a hood on and

Warrington shoots a glance over to you

ok how easily can I get him out of this

pit well if I like drop a rope from what

do you be able to climb out you could

probably just climb out oh okay yeah

yeah there's no one else here it's just

a halfling yeah without saying anything

dear Phil just be like the sky whisper

and then like give like that

come with me motion you don't go around

the 2d Gong yes that was a really good

Warrington George was very very good

Warrington and the halflings sort of

intercedes and he just sort of conker on

the head and she falls over and he says

we can't leave yet what do you mean we

can't leave yet not where there's a

trove of smoke

oh right right I heard there's a

sizeable trove downhill okay is that

something you feel you can retrieve on

your own and then meet back up with us

my Gretchen sense isn't what it used to

be this place is quite amazed what what

indeed sorry

[Laughter]

stone for okay I am mending now okay you

know yeah it's true she's used to things

being a little rocky Wow it doesn't rub

her the wrong way
