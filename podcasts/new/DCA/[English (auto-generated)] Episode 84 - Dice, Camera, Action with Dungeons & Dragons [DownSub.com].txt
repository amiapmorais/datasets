buddy and welcome to dice camera action

where nobody dies ever right I'm

literally just typing I feel that aching

my joints where a character deaths a

Bruin yup yeah only emotionally I got

the cup ready today guys we were just

joking earlier that we already know that

crying as a free action but now we know

that death is a reaction and we were

also talking about Ana being in the snow

last week and Nate being under the Sun

strange reversal the sweet sweet irony

sweet sweet irony yes so previously in

dice camera action paltin made new

friends of to shadow Kai assassins in

the shadow fell before setting down

roots in a run-down two-story tavern

called the dead I'd drunk and meanwhile

his companions the rest of the waffle

crew along with their new friend Miranda

Moon whisper and led by Simon chased

after him and along the way encountered

a nobleman on a horse named Lord Nile

and also Avis tani wagon being led by

Strix his half-brother Isaac from

morovia and music seem to have had a

change of heart after losing his

fiendish arm and also gave the waffle

crew mr. Shambo face ya which tricks

Paco thank you

which tricks hid away in the folds of

her robe when they finally arrived at

the y-shaped crossroads which the tavern

overlooks the waffle crew found the area

blanketed in thick snow with an army of

snowmen all around the tavern Strix

barreled toward the tavern on her broom

barged inside to confront paltin and was

immediately stabbed in the back by the

two shadow kai assassins and went down

one of the assassins took mr. shamble

face off of her before her body

disappeared in oily black smoke and sort

of fell into the floor where

upon Strix had a side adventure with the

c-team over an acquisitions inc where

she found herself in the Underdark in a

in the city with drow and there she

helped to the c team out of a fix and

also secured a couple things a few

things that she hopes will help her

friends back in the shadow fell

whereupon horrible beasties dragged her

back down into the earth and the sea

team never saw her again

[Laughter]

while Strix has been absent DF nimbly

darted through the army of snowmen

toward the tavern getting very very

close

evylyn at pretty much the same except

flying through the air with her flaming

sword

knocking snowmen in the head as she goes

in the heads as she she flies by and

following them as well Miranda found

herself kind of swarmed by these and

used her ring of the RAM to slam one of

the snowmen back whereupon the snow fell

away revealing that underneath each of

these snowmen is an ice paltin with a

sword Miranda what would you like to do

you are now surrounded by these ice Paul

tones you were also shot by a dart that

came out of Simon's mouth some distance

back he's about 60 feet away from you

the snowmen are much closer there within

5 to 15 feet of you okay how far away am

i from the tavern your let's say that

you are 30 feet 30 feet all right I'm

going to try to hidden paths up to the

roof okay now you notice right away that

this two-story tavern is in pretty bad

shape and there is a thick heavy weight

of snow on top of the roof there are

holes in the roof that the snow is

falling into all in all pretty

dilapidated on one corner of the

building is a turret that's a little bit

higher than the rest of

structure you can pretty much choose to

move yourself onto the main roof or onto

the roof of the turret your choice

can I see anything on the turret yeah

you can see at the top of the conical

roof of the turret is an iron weather

vane with a raven worked into its design

a wrought iron Raven I'm actually going

to jump up to the roof where they're

close to a hole not okay got it okay so

as you materialize on the rooftop I

would like you to make a dexterity

saving throw to stay on the roof and and

you do not have any disadvantage on this

because of your despair so 11 all right

that is enough you are able to hold on

and as you hang on near the hole in the

roof you can feel the roof give

underneath you slightly it sags more and

you hear creaking and groaning as it's

struggling to bear even your slender

weight and as you look down into the

hole you can see the snow to be a

wrecked room that may have been like a

an inn keepers quarters upstairs or

something like that you can see wrecked

furnishings down below a little bit of

light streaming through crooked windows

things like that but it doesn't look

like it's occupied okay so you are now

on the roof of the building and out of

the reach of the ice Paul tunes that for

you the hidden paths for you was a bonus

action what else would you like to do

I would like to mask of the wild and try

and make myself not so visible up here

okay and so does that require any check

on your part yeah so you can attempt to

hide so make a stealth check which for

you is a dexterity check plus 320 - whoa

okay so even though you're on a white

roof you are able to mask yourself quite

nicely excellent good job great start

all right down below Miranda you can see

Lord Nile still waiting through it's his

turn now and he's going to hack at the

one of the the ice paul tunes and he

hits it twice and actually shatters it

and then you see he sort of ganged up on

by a whole pack of these ice Paul tunes

who starts thrusting and stabbing at him

with their swords DF you were here

you're 30 feet away you've slipped

through the vanguard of ice Paul Tain's

you're now kind of staring at the tavern

with the darkened doorway open darkness

within to one side of the tavern to your

left

parked is the battered old coach pulled

by the ogre zombie with the hook hand

and the zombies just sort of staring

stupidly off into space not paying any

attention to anything that's going on

okay is there a like stairway up or

anything to this tavern or structure or

is it just no it's it's sort of perched

on a bit of a hill so there's there's

nothing really there's like a step

leading into the door well it's got a

little bit a hill okay yes yeah and the

other thing you can see that most of the

tavern is made of wood that's

deteriorating but there is a big stone

chimney off to one side there's the

turret off to the other side and then

hanging from all the eaves are these

weird glyphs made out of twigs that have

all been bound together right and evylyn

is like behind me

yeah she's sort of up touching up into

your right she's just sort of flown over

gone over this sort snowman so she's

kind of as close to the tavern as you

but elevated yeah she said she was

dragging the harness Benelli flaming it

like I just sort of yes she was a sort

of whacking snowman on the head all

right so I'm just gonna keep my foreign

motion continues

spring forward tuck towards the entrance

of this tavern okay once I get close

enough I'm actually going to do a

moonsault and at the peak at that

moonsault as I'm turning around I take a

flask of oil and throw it straight down

at the ground just splattering the oil

all around near this entrance in evens

path okay okay so then like a land and

then I turn my attention back towards

like the tavern okay so do you want to

be when you end your move after you've

thrown the flask down and splashed oil

in the doorway do you want to be outside

the tavern is that what I'm

understanding yes I'll be outside

yeah the the tavern and like the oil is

basically making a protective barrier

near the entrance okay all right and so

drawing the oil smashing it that'll be

your action and then you complete your

move and you're done yeah and then

evylyn you're flying through the air you

saw ya take an oil flask shatter it down

in front of the door the open doorway of

the tavern and then deke to the side

basically and did you say paltin had

come out of the tavern or he's

presumably still inside presumably still

inside the last you saw Strix rocketed

inside the tavern and is in there

somewhere

and I can arrive at the tavern door on

this turn yeah you thirty feet away from

the tavern door okay

so I I land next to DES and I give him a

nod like I I understand what you did I

see it and then I step through the oil

through the open doorway okay do you

want to let your sword ignite the oil no

I'm holding it above the oil ready but

I'm not as you attempt to move through

the doorway it feels like you're walking

into a sponge and then you are pushed

back by an unseen force I yell through

the unseen force paulten as your eye as

you look into the dark interior of the

taproom

you can see palton in its depths

a lot of the furniture has been moved

around and pushed out of the way just

inside the door a little ways there's a

blanket like a torn piece of blanket or

rug kind of lying in a pile and then

beyond that about 15 feet beyond that

you see paltin he is a dark shape in the

darkness but his eyes are glowing blue

Halton she's like kind of like Alton you

see evylyn in the doorway and when she

tried to enter she got repulsed I'm she

has her sword but she's kind of putting

it behind her and and has one hand out

like coaxing like a scared dog and she's

paltin I know that this isn't you I know

I know something's talking to you and

listen I've I've never asked anything of

you have I I've never asked you to be

anything other than you are I've never

asked you to do anything other than what

you want but I'm asking you now your

family is here and if that's ever meant

anything to you if you've ever cared

anything for me stop and take that ring

off don't make me do this Chris how do I

feel about this the ring says to you hey

it's you and me forever bro don't listen

to her they left you the mercy of straw

Dan Castle Raven laughs remember you had

to get out of that by yourself and then

down in the fire giant fortress you

remember that you were off on your own

they didn't care about you you had to

find your own way out do you want that

to be your life when we have all of this

and soon more I can't but I want choke

the ring slay and it's hard to fight

that logic huh out with the old bro and

with the new hey all right

I feel ya I feel ya ah now this is it's

not technically your turn yet paltin su

but the talking is a free action so you

can obviously talk to evil in

mm-hmm and she's just standing there

like my name is okay oh not good just

she's beaming as much care as she can to

you like never seen her eyes so wide and

she's just like paulsen if there's if

there's anything in you any one of us

please let that Park speak to you right

now

Chris do I have an ID because I saw her

like kind of get repelled when she tried

to walk in yes do I have an idea of what

that was or make an intelligence check

or intelligence Arcana I guess it's the

same thing with you it's just an

intelligence check mmm yeah yeah you

know that's smart up there all right and

for the purposes of mechanics I guess

what I'm actually doing with my action

is holding action to ignite the oil with

the trigger being him trying to hurt any

of us uh that check was a 21 okay you

you haven't seen this effect this effect

hasn't been relevant to you before but

you suddenly piece together that this

place must be magically warded against

certain kinds of individuals and that

may be because of the glyphs that are

hanging on the outside of the building

you saw Strix come in with no problem

whatsoever yeah and they're just

discrimination man damn and uh yep and

evil in are out front yeah you saw EF

briefly spring into the doorframe drop

the oil and sort of leap to the side out

of view and now evylyn is literally

standing just in the doorway or just

outside of the doorway with the the

winter light the gray the gray winter

behind her and I should have mentioned

at the beginning the the snow is just

falling and falling and falling upon

this entire scene even as you stand

there death and evil and you're like

brushing flakes off and Miranda you're

brushing flakes off yourself and and the

temperature is quite quite cold not to

you evil and you can't

thanks for the reminder Chris yeah

you're welcome and then the ring says to

you paltin a dude we got of course

action here we got a plan we got to

follow through and when you're right

you're right I'm gonna I'm gonna respond

to evylyn okay oh by the way paltin your

turn is next so okay it's like Oh Eve

I'm so sorry

that's all I'll say okay would you like

to take any action on your turn what on

the turn now okay so uh huh

how far is how far is like the entrance

from me like how far are they 15 feet 15

feet and so Miranda a transport did did

I know that she transport not well

actually yeah you do know she's up there

um because she's in contact with the

snow so and the other and as an actually

you can even here in this creaky old

building the sound of the roof creaks

coming all the way down to you

suggesting you know she's sort of over

to your right on the second floor of

love you and I how like how far is that

like how tall is this oh it's you know

she's on the second storey roof so she's

probably about 30 feet away from you but

up and like there's like wall and floor

between you okay uh so um just kind of

like gets up just looking around it's

like all right we're gonna do the thing

now oh my god they're waiting they're

waiting I've been waiting and waiting

waiting all right cool all right fam

let's go and I'm gonna set off

using the ring mm-hmm a freezing spear

okay but if do to do the Lu clean up the

spell right now to Luc's Brazil freezing

sir a frigid world within just such a

great mood today it is a frigid globe of

cold energy streaks from your fingertips

to a point you choose within range where

it explodes in a 60 foot radius sphere

collie wonder where it's going so with

it being 60 feet would that just be able

to reach pretty much everything pretty

much 60 foot radius yeah that engulfs

the entire tavern it's like cool let's

do it I'm gonna links right from where I

am so evil and you're the only one who

sees this icy orb appear in Paul Tain's

hand that he just casts down on the

floor and it explodes outward in this

great globe of energy that blasts past

you blast through the walls and blasts

upward through every crack and orifice

in the building and so I would like

everybody present except Strix to make a

I should look this up Constitution I

believe oh comes before P my heart is

beating it is a constitution saving

throw and so none of you have

disadvantage on that because of your

despair if Strix were here she would but

she's not I roll a 25 good I assume that

I'm able to stand up under it so I

imagine that even is sitting in that

doorway and hurt Oh half damaged yeah

well I just for fluff I want to imagine

that she sorry she I want to imagine you

know even standing there with her hand

out to him and she kind of like shields

herself and bears up under guess under

the the buffeting yeah

and then she looks up at him sadly and

says then Pelton is truly God

all right so evylyn made it

Miranda how is your role eleven know and

Jared Jared twenty baby okay

so it's a ten d6 damaged paltin oh okay

so alright give me give me a minute here

[Music]

oh that's a one okay more whines all

ones okay that's cool uh-huh okay yeah

almost there almost there

okay Street and then last one okay so

okay so

37 oh okay so Miranda you take 37 cold

damage and yeah yeah do you have evasion

not against Constitution savings room

right on the dexterity that's right the

calf yeah so you're going to take that

he's within he's close to me right yes

I'm ready to say but he made the save so

he's alright he's just another matter

yeah he's just take half damage which is

18 cold damage uh-huh and evil in is

evil and is also taking 18 cold damage

and that would trigger my held action so

yeah when when evylyn says then Paulson

is truly gone she lets the tip of her

sword fall into the oil and steps back

yes okay so it lights the doorway ablaze

and let me see if this thing does

anything else I need to worry about doo

doo doo doo doo doo nope okay so the

structure of the building you can see

paltin as your effect goes out frost

just sort of covers everything the bar

the the stools the chairs the tables the

walls and you can hear the building just

sort of creak and groan and almost shift

a little bit as it barely sort of

withstands the blast of cold that blows

out from it yeah after I do that and I

see all that I like I'm going to ask the

ring I'm like dude do we actually need

the building or is it just this general

area the ring says well I kind of

thought it would be cool if this was our

base I mean tavern is named appropriate

steady supply ale coming this way yeah I

just I don't I don't see this this place

blasting too much longer so that's why I

asked well looks like your friends can't

get in here that easily so maybe we

should wait here a little bit longer

Kendu for our protection cool because it

looks like that one's still alive yeah

all right Miranda hey Chris yeah so the

the reason I was asking about dates

being next to me was the saving throw

but also the aura of warding which is

resistance to damage from spells oh

great so I don't know how that works I

don't change anything

I'm it means that death takes nine

points of damage instead of 18 nice good

job yeah oh and me too

me and friendly creatures oh I forgot to

make two other saving throws for two

individuals yeah and what about what

about objects - like dolls

I hate to say only if they're in the

area okay and not in they have to be

unattended objects so

all right you're you're chilly chill

cold also had an effect on Maurice IANA

and levar doe and they're dead the ring

flies off his hand and everyone's happy

for once in their lives all right yeah

so they both they're hidden in the

shadows paltin but they do kind of

reveal themselves when they let out a

horriffic sort of mole as the cold

washes over them and they are both

affected by it

but you know whatever I just see it I'm

just like you know good right

Lavar doe says do do and right before it

happened

Murray siano is like Christo serra de la

Rosa and yeah but they're they're still

there these they're not bloodied so

they're alright they will however at the

end of your turn

Louisiana will toss mr. shamble face to

levar doe and he'll just sort of tuck it

into his coat y'all remember right right

see okay good all right Miranda back to

you okie dokie are there any trees

nearby

no no so it's just an open stance just

the ones that the tavern is made out of

yeah okay um yeah great fantastic

is there any snow on top of the turret

there is not play as much as on the less

sloped roof that you're on but yes there

is snow on that roof as well all right

then I'm going to wild shape into a

giant vulture

and who I over to that weathervane and

stand on top of it and like kick the

snow off of it okay yeah when you stand

on the weathervane it's sort of creaks

and sways a little bit under your weight

but it still it remains attached you'll

know you're not perched on the

weathervane in this giant bird form sit

here for the foreseeable future yeah all

right you see Lord Nile still hacking

away and he is the the snowmen have all

just kind of surrounded him completely

there's like walls of them now around

him these ice paltin stabbing at him and

hacking at him with their ice blades and

he is attempting to fend them off looks

like it's probably going to be a losing

battle for him but not much you can do

at present you'd make a perception check

Miranda oh well good thing I turned into

this giant bird yeah cuz I get some you

get advantage for being a smart bird

good thing too that's better uh nineteen

you can see Simon sort of making his way

through the snow kind of creating a

little trench behind him and then he

gets into snow so deep he just sort of

disappears oh that's fine yeah that's

kind of toured the tavern yeah

you also see off to one side Isaac this

big burly fellow he is also smashing

through snowmen right now and seems to

be faring a little bit better than Lord

Niall he hits one with such force he

just takes its head clean off with his

axe and he's just wielding his axe

one-handed chopping off heads as he may

DF you're standing outside the doorway

of the inn is ablaze it's like a

rectangular ring of flame

mm-hmm uh and evil in his inside she's

outside she took a step back so she's

out in the weather with you okay still

clutching her flaming sword great did

the fire like did the oil ignite did it

burn anything yeah I just just described

the doors now okay basically a ring of

flame around got in it's all lit up

he'll turn to evil and and say did you

see Strix curiously absent she shakes

her head sadly Oh God

yes like looks back at the tavern and

then looks back at evil and I think back

towards the tavern and then gives even a

look like I'm about to do something

stupid I didn't see her in there you

hear palton roses like dude if you made

your entrance through a flaming door

they've been pretty sick it's got your

back I'm looking cool evylyn kind of

just puts out a hand like not telling

him what to do but like a stand down

invitation she heard it like illustrates

fire verse ice it's awesome she just

says you you aren't very strong right

now

alright imagine at this point with the

death curse deus injuries has ever had

in scars becoming more and more

prominent all over his body alike from

rope burns to life being cut off like

burns across his arms and life so not

not like sickly is like really really

thin but just like all of his scars or

just showing much much more so he'll

just call out force tricks and just try

to see if she responds at all and then

response oh man

correction response right and then he'll

just like kind of look around everywhere

trying to get any kind of sign of her

and then that's pretty much it won't

take any actual acnes just look around

for no sign of her no sign of her just

the just that pollens cat call when I

saw the like piles on the floor and I

assume like the oily burn marks and

stuff did I see that oily burn mark that

might have told me that we that Strix

was spirited away again like did I

perceive that no okay all right so DF

holding pat evylyn standing standing in

front of the flaming doorway and the

flames are sort of licking the the top

of the the doorframe and I go

methodically cut down with resolve all

of the glyph hangy glyph board things

okay my flaming zart um as you come up

toward one your rappelled before you can

hit it I scream in frustration you

flutter you try to whack it needs to

sort of Bolton bounces off like mere

inches away from it and they're sort of

rattling around in the wind and things

but yeah you can't connect with them so

seeing that evil end is struggling with

that can I instead use my action to try

to attack and destroy those I would

invite idea a little oh okay how are you

what are we gonna do like just leap up

and try to tear one off with your sword

or pull one off with your hands yeah I

guess just trying to like cut it with a

sword not to like safely take it down

disassemble it like I mean I tried to

shatter it or break it

slice it yeah you you two are repelled

before you hit it and even even like you

can't even put your hand against the

building you're just sort of like an

inch away from the building something is

preventing you from touching

I can't even get in there then uh I go

looking for Simon okay you sure you see

a giant bird perched on the turret

weathervane that wasn't there before

big vulture right ah and you don't need

to make a check for that but make a

perception check to see if you came

Simon it never fails

no no kind of sound like it fails all

the time it always fails

nein okay this round you do not

curiously you don't see him on the

battlefield you see Lord Nile surrounded

by ice paulten as you see Isaac

surrounded by ice poems but no Simon

okay I don't have any other action right

you don't because you tried to make an

attack against the caliphs and then you

moved upward but evylyn I will give you

another perception check because on

Simon's turn he is moving

so go ahead evil in and repeat your say

or your perception check 15 okay yeah

you do see Simon kind of poke his head

up out of the snow to get his bearings

and then he goes back down in the snow

and he's about 15 feet away from the

tavern when he died man else think of

those Bugs Bunny cartoons yeah yeah

exactly exactly and then when you after

you see him and your eyes just sort of

track backward you can see the little

trench that he left before he

disappeared under the snow and he does

seem to be on a beeline to the tavern

okay

I like track but he's not quite he's not

quite there yet he's making slow

progress paltin you're back yes sir

really yeah they're not nothing's really

happening should we go out there the

ring tells you

maybe we should wait until the snow men

get him

I think we're safer in here I'm worried

I'm worried they might try to like like

gang up on you and try to separate us

which would be yeah that wouldn't be

cool no not at all

really I haven't oh go ahead no go ahead

sir no after you he says it's like we

could send something out there okay so

gonna so I'm the this whole dragon thing

I feel like it's not it's not super

working out so why don't we send like

could we send like up like a bird friend

out there sure cool yeah

nice bird like do you want just a like a

what kind of bird is there a bird that

can like I don't know like like peck at

their faces or something

mm-hmm yeah like do you want to do

something kind of big like a rock or do

you want to do something smaller like a

I don't know the giant barn owl or

something uh let's let's go let's go

let's go bigger let's go at that first

option oh okay um yeah you might have to

burn a few charges for this one sure

sure

how many charges would you like to burn

um

Devon what's left you haven't well you

use the auto Luke's sphere mm-hmm which

uses how many charges is that three okay

so you've got 17 charges left well then

there was also the clone oh right yes

and so that was six charges so you've

used nine you've got 11 left okay cool

didn't want to overlook that let's uh

how about we give let's make this a

sixer okay make a charisma check for me

charisma check

okay oh hi I just can't make animals

than that one okay like a balloon animal

yeah sounds like a ring just keeps

letting you down Oh so the ring does not

follow through you you are not able to

sculpt the creature that you want and it

just sort of disappears before you

before it takes shape but the charges

are spent great that wasn't my fault

okay okay cool great well I guess we'll

have to see what happens later on then

all right at this point you're too

shadow Kai friends Lavar doe comes out

and just sort of with a look of

impatience says what is keeping them

outside like I don't know there's

there's something there's something

holding them off I didn't I didn't put

it there but someone put it there and

it's there and now they can't get it and

then like this plan is falling apart

right it looks so much better in my head

but now now we're just like kind of

sitting like twiddling our thumbs um

like I don't know go out there see dude

you're something we shall sneak out

there and kill them

yeah sure that's fine all right they go

skulking off into the shadows and

Miranda perched on the roof you see all

I see everything I see for miles uh do I

have any indication of whether or not if

I made my Hearst bubble the snow would

fall through it or into it but

dippity-do you touch a point in space a

30 foot radius sphere of magic appears

centered on a point total cover blocks

the sphere got it got it got it

blah blah doot doot doot doot doot there

is nothing in the description that says

it perfect prevents the passage of

anything so yes snow would fall through

it hmm

hmm am I going to do I don't even know

anymore I'm still gonna I'd like to cry

a little bit

just a tiny tiny bit okay reaction

reaction yeah and then I'm going to try

to drop wild shape and hold on to the

weathervane without bending it off and

breaking it oh and I want to past cure

whoops

can I see paltin or can I see DFL uh

yeah from up here you can see him down

by the side of the building

yes okay so first before you do that

yeah and in wild shape back into your

normal form and hang on to the

weathervane just make a dexterity

acrobatics check for me or a strength

athletics if you prefer to hang on oh

definitely acrobatics there you go oh

that's fine that's fifteen yeah you hang

on to the vein no problem huh okay Anna

Anna

evylyn seize the vault giant vulture

turn into Miranda who's now hanging on

to this iron weathervane and when the

wind blows the weather vane just sort of

turns a little bit and creaks loudly how

far away am i from the others uh you DF

is about Motz you're up on the weather

vane so you're about 35 feet up in the

air so you're about 40 feet away from

death and and evil ends up in the air

about 40 feet up in the air from you oh

you're all so far away

um am i at all able to shimmy down the

turret a little bit so that there's

thirty feet between me and DF yeah you

can sort of try to slide your way down

to the roof and kind of hang off the

turret roof try to find purchase on some

outcropping

in the wall but you're gonna have to

make a strength athletics check for this

one - one comes in so yes you you slide

down

you almost make it look like a winter

sport and almost yeah you sort of glide

down you find purchase you're hanging

there now 30 feet away from DF I'm gonna

do some master wounds okay

he and I great

I'm sure he and I will love that yeah if

you feel a warm tingly sensation its

foreign it confuses me 50 points alright

okay excellent round for Miranda DF

invigorated with 16 extra hip points

what do you do Oh evil went flying up uh

still I still don't know a word or sight

of Strix so she probably wasn't even

real this whole time so that's cool well

that's right yeah but his dad would

start to creep in yeah sounds like oh

right that makes sense

it makes a lot of sense yeah I can

really still do much more than I'm kind

of comfortable with other then just wait

outside the tavern for hopefully palton

okay I guess he'll just come off okay so

let's kind of call back out to him just

saying paltin please

we've come all this way we've come for

you I don't care about the ring I don't

care about either was said to we need

you am i moved at all

make a persuasion check D F I didn't get

to make one of those I'm actually

proficient in this I don't know if I'm

ever really used it before so that's

neat your profession in persuasion yeah

oh the things you learn mm-hmm

twelve okay Paul thing you don't think

it's very persuasive just with two party

members trying to talk you down off the

ledge it would take it would take all of

them only there were a third one around

all right so you stay out of danger D F

but D F make it perception check and I'm

gonna give you advantage on this cuz

you're a sharp cookie oh okay

twenty five you see that as Isaac is

sort of fighting the snowmen

he he finally sort of clears a path

where he can disengage and he advances

toward you and the doorway bringing the

army of ice Paul tunes with him they're

after him but he's actually leading them

to you and he doing ages makes his way

up to you and up to the doorway and

looks inside and he says tricks

strannix no I hate him and that you see

the paul tunes the ice paul tunes

marching in toward you it's hot damn it

huh there's so like dozens of those yes

yeah yeah there's there's a total of

about eighty eight of them

[Music]

so he and he's just screaming strikes

and and paltin you can see music this

one armed hulking man screaming in the

doorway he's got a blade do I remember

now now that he's shouting strict his

name yeah you recognize him as the crazy

mofo back from burrow via who wanted

strict so bad he could taste it and

hanged me oh right oh my god I'm so

sorry my bad dude to see you and it is

evil ins turn did so use expanding at

the door yeah he all he used all of his

movement to get to the door he hasn't

even a doesn't have enough movement to

March inside ok but he wasn't like

repulsed like I was yes even tried at

this point and he's just shouting for

Strix I go to Simon where I see his

little burrow going and I intersect his

little burrow and I reach down in the

snow and pop him out of it ok when you

pop him out you can see he sort of opens

his mouth like he's gonna dart you and

then he closes it again thanks buddy

gee she kind of holds him real close and

she goes I know you love your daddy do

you do you think you can help us make

sure that that evil ring doesn't take

him over he sort of kind of shrugs ok

come on

we're gonna go help him and she kind of

tucks him into one arm and then she

flies over to the doorway ok and she

says and she's she okay here's the door

and he's a kind of blocking it she kind

of like pokes her head like this and she

has Simon like this and she holds him up

she's like Alton Simon's out here and he

loves you and I love you and we all love

you and maybe you could take the ring

off so that you don't hurt your son or

anyone else who loves you the ring says

she's threatening us she's gonna kill

Simon if

you do what she says cry back I'm like

you put him down right now

don't hurt him he did nothing to you I'm

not hurting him Simon we're at work the

Rings okay right there he's like

that's cold we kept him safe

I have sigh I'm like Simon we're okay

right nod and tell daddy that we're okay

and that we're safe he just stays still

uh unhelpful child Simon you come here

right now

you come in here you see his little legs

try to move like he wants to walk toward

you but he's being held by evylyn but

would you please just put him he's just

a boy she shakes her head sadly and she

starts stepping back from the doorway so

he sort of disappears from your view

palton no all right I'm not sending her

boy in there was ice crazy man all right

Simon won't do anything on his turn

palton it's your attorney I am going to

don't take the bait says the ring like

she's good she's gonna kill him our

assassins are going out there I'm gonna

I'm gonna go up to the door open out

like cross through the barrier so DF

music and evylyn can all see paltin

inside the doorway his glowing blue eyes

and do I see you see eASIC is more or

less right in front of the door DF is

kind of off to one side and evylyn is

off to the other side with Simon in her

clutches and then there's this wall of

ice Paul turns marching in toward them

closing them in

do I have an IE do I perceive that the I

love my my shadow friends are out and

about doing stuff yes you can sense them

they're outside the building and moving

around to flank your friends I'm gonna

I'm gonna look to evil and you'll be

like I don't know what's happened to you

or what's gotten into you but it doesn't

need to be like this put the boy down

and he doesn't get hurt I'm going to I'm

gonna tell her like last chance I won't

call this the easy way

easiest way just let him go no one's

here to hurt anyone it's enough you

can't you can't just trick me you can't

try and pull stuff over on me and think

that's okay

I'm being real honest that's all they've

ever tried to do to you palton you're

right you're right

wait I believe it right I believe the

ring yeah yeah okay then I'm going to

cast crown of madness on music okay

wait he's exposing ten feet of me he is

but it's not your ally

what he is - no no what the that

Cod there's a lot of implication there

damn it

 hate that guy ah he's gonna make

a saving throw and and and he's got

disadvantage because of despair alright

a crown of glittering iron appears over

his head as he falls under Paul Tain's

sway after does I'm gonna look at him

I'm at a point like save the boy

alright he will turn his hateful gaze

upon evil and and must use its action

before moving on each of its turns to

make a melee attack against a creature

other than itself they meant they choose

okay and the target connect okay the

target wait a minute I do to do the

charm target must use its action before

making before moving on each of its

turns to make a melee attack against a

creature other than itself that you

mentally choose so because it has to

attack before it moves you probably want

to direct it paltin to attack DF because

that's daily standing next to don't save

the other boy okay and then the target

can act normally on its turn if you

choose no creature or if none are within

its reach all right and you're

maintaining control this effect groovy

that is Paul tunes turn Miranda like oh

it's gonna be a good fight can I see the

assassins at all make a perception check

um 18 no no okay

going to cast call lightning on Isaac

then all right lovely okay and a storm

cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder

that is ten feet tall and has a 60-foot

radius centered on a plant you can see

all right so big big cylindrical storm

cloud appears over the tavern and when

you cast the spell choose a point within

range and a bolt of lightning flashes

down on that point each creature within

five feet of that point must make

Secretariat safer I assume you don't

want to hit any your friends you can

just target okay he's got to make a

dexterity saving through okay and he

rolled a 1028 oh okay he gets stroked by

this lightning that comes down upon him

he is still alive however when the

Lightning stops but you can keep

concentrating on this as you know yes

future lightning bolts going to keep

concentrating but like barely holding on

to the turret all right d/f you are up

you see Isaac look at you with madness

in his eyes a crown above his head

lightning has just struck him from above

and ice Paulson's are surrounding you oh

this is like that's a terrifying sight I

I wouldn't want him after me

all OH every bone in my body wants to

speed the out of eASIC wants that

oh you know self-control doesn't have to

always be the case uh so I mean at this

point like palta is pretty much right

there and we can like see him oh yeah

yeah he's just inside the doorway great

okay I'm still not don't think I would

really do a whole lot here other than I

guess just evylyn kind of points that

the snow creatures you might want to go

into a defensive yeah

fold yeah so y'all use the action to

take to take that the defensive action

okay but let's turn back to palton

almost like just kind of defeated and

almost as if his last attempt to reach

the palton that he knows and not the

Paulton that's before him he'll just

look at it and just say all I wanted to

do is for you to see how lucky you are

[Music]

I'll see how lucky but what has to do

with this pal and then he'll just almost

like take a step back and kind of it

evylyn okay come on yeah as the ice as

the ice puffins closing around you your

step back is kind of toward the the wall

of the tavern so they're not backing

into ice blades and obviously trying to

keep your eye on Isaac as well paltin

after responding to DF you hear

something behind you inside the tavern

and it sounds like this horrible moan

and then the floor where Strix fell kind

of peels open almost like a black Mouth

and the trash which enters the scene

sort of crawling up out of the floor and

she's in her clutches what looks like a

stone statue see the Strix laid out

before you on the floor of the tavern

with what looks like a petrified dwarf

yeah she's right she's definitely crying

Strix what would you like to do you have

returned to the last place you remember

being in the shadow fell but some things

have changed the furniture has moved

around there's frost over everything

where there wasn't before and paltin is

no longer in front of you but behind you

standing in the doorway okay how close

is he to me he is almost you are right

at his feet okay I can I see the ring at

all on his hand yeah it's it's evident

on his hand because it is kind of

glowing with the bluish light and there

are sort of veins coming off the ring of

his hand and fingers now let's think

about this to use the stopwatch that

thankfully given to me by a by oh man

okay so you're not gonna do anything

with that petrified dwarf not okay yeah

okay I want to use for

I want to take the scissors out of my

row yep and I want to use the stopwatch

okay the what delet into what she hopes

she pulls out what looks like a pocket

watch at a weird sort of flat disc

shaped device with some switches or

something on it and she pulls out her

iron the scissors and then she does

something Strix make a intelligence

Arcana check to activate the item okay

18 okay

de lutte then she presses it and then I

take the scissors and I cut his finger

well I mean now I know Miranda you are

hanging off the turret when you suddenly

see the falling snow around you slow and

stop and just hang still in the air

the wind that you heard seems to be kind

of absent all of a sudden and the

weather vane that was creaking above you

on top of the turret just freezes in

place and there's no sound you C D F

Isaac evylyn Simon Lord Nile the army of

Paul Tain's all frozen absolutely still

everything around you is perfectly still

except you what do you do and I hear

anything no

my first instinct is to think that this

is something that Paulding has done in

which case Miranda is going to book it

for the opening on the roof and scramble

inside and go down to confront him make

a just to scramble across the the snowy

roof just make a dexterity acrobatics

check as you as you leap down from where

you are on the turret onto the roof and

then try to scurry to a hole 14 okay

it's a little slippery you kind of slide

a little bit and you kind of have to

kind of catch yourself but you make it

to the hole and you can disappear down

inside on to the second floor landing on

the floor like a cat and everything in

here is kind of timeless anyway there

wasn't much activity here but you just

sense that everything around you is

still frozen in time okay she's gonna

are there stairs down obviously right

yeah when you sort of pull out of this

little room that you drop in and it's

got a kind of an open doorway leading

out to an upstairs hall with mostly torn

off railing and a staircase going down

that looks rickety and old you can also

see a room across the sort of the what

at the other end of the this upstairs

hall with a door open that looks like it

may have been a little bit more lived in

there's a fresh blanket there and things

like that but you don't care about that

you sort of make your way to the stairs

and by the time you get to the top of

the stairs you've used probably about 30

feet of movement so you've still got

some movement to go down the stairs at

that point okay um just gonna prepare

insect plague because that's what she's

holding out for okay now if you move if

you move good if you go down the stairs

you'll be using another move action so

you won't have an action left to cast a

spell just so you know oh yeah okay when

you run down into the stairs they lead

you down into the taproom and what you

see is an equally baffling scene

everything is sort of covered with frost

and everything is perfectly still you

see strix

lying on the floor frozen holding a pair

of scissors in one hand and what looks

like a stopwatch in the other

probably bought the cheap version and

you can see paltin turning to look down

at her with a look of alarm on his face

his hand with the ring sort of

alarmingly close to Strix his scissors

by mere circumstance and beyond them an

open doorway where again you see frozen

isaac frozen paul Tain's everything is

frozen and i finished the job you can

finish your movement and get all the way

to Strix and paltin and be done can i

abuse and pass to finish the job faster

can you what can i have use hidden paths

to finish the job faster Oh

magical pathways a bonus actually a turn

you can teleport up to 60 feet to an

unoccupied space you can see no because

you would have had you you you started

to use your second action when you went

down the stairs yeah

so you've used a move you've used your

action you could use a bonus action to

get there but then you don't have any

action left to do anything else okay I'm

just gonna be as ready as I can take to

cut it off okay

as you get near them you're right near

them alright you could I will say you

could probably take the scissors out of

Strix as hands if you wanted to because

essentially picking and picking up an

object is a free action that you can do

once on your turn could you pick up a

ring off of someone's hand

I'm just saying rings oh come on or that

can I try and slide it off yes and you

succeed thank you come on you pull the

ring off of Paul Tain's finger and you

have it in your hand and that's when you

see the to shatter Kai step into the

doorway they appear to be unaffected by

this effect as well and

the female Chateau KY says that even

that achene I have a deal they pull out

their blades but they stop as you talk

to them I just want to get out of here

with this and I'll trade you something

they look at each other then look back

at you and smile they say what do you

have two things I have two magical items

that I can trade you if you let me get

away

the woman says tell us more and she

takes off the cloak and she puts it down

on the ground and she puts her staff on

top of it they'll sort of slide past

paltin into the room and look at these

items and Lavar dough will pick up the

staff and examine it and he seems to

take a shine to it almost

he sort of uses tested out like a

walking stick or whatever but Narayana

doesn't seem to pay any attention the

items and she comes right up to and she

says I don't collect items how do you

want she takes her gray fingers and just

sort of caresses your face what no no no

no no no no you want my face see

beautiful face

the co-pays I have ever seen you'll let

me live and take the ring away if I give

you my face CC okay you can have it

all right time returns suddenly strix

it's like nothing happened you clicked

it and it didn't work but stuck and

you've got the scissors in your hand and

you're just getting ready to chop off

Paulson's finger and you see the ring

has disappeared and paltin in that

moment you feel a kind of horrible

because as soon as time resumes there's

an instant disconnect between you and

the ring just absolutely suddenly just

gone and you look and you see the

scissors and you're like oh my god she

chopped off my finger my finger has been

chopped off my oh it's still there what

the where's the ring

it's gone ring ring ring hello

and what what what's what's like my

initial feeling toward that am I like is

it like uh Oh like I'm back to normal

and great or is it more like an

emptiness like you feel like the the

cold sort of blue veins and your arm are

starting to fade and it's like you've

just come to your senses like you've

awakened from a dark dark dark dream I

remember everything

yes

those of you outside don't really

perceive that anything has happened

you still got Simon evylyn deaath you're

still being guarded but dia as you sort

of and Isaac still got his crown of

madness activated and he looks like he's

still going to try to smash you into a

pulp but all of the paltin statues are

just standing there

immobile they're not moving and in fact

some of them are so sort of badly posed

that they just sort of fall over and

start to collapse into each other sort

of cascading and toppling under their

own imbalanced weight all right that's

still about one pissed off you think all

right Holly

it was strict cistern when you activated

the magic item do you what do you want

to do with the scissor just have

anything just put them back disappointed

I get disappointed chop off your friends

finger all right and evylyn what do you

do I am outside and didn't really see

what happened right correct

so I still don't know that I can go in

the house I don't have any indication

that I could do that correct

I see eASIC oh and actually that reminds

me of something Holly at the end of your

turn right you sorry to jump back in I

should have remembered this you feel

something almost invisible like

invisible hand pick you up and throw you

outside oh so evylyn you see Strix come

tumbling out of the doorway and land in

the snow strokes are you okay no I'm not

okay are you wounded you look you look

better you look not so bad I mean

emotionally wounded yeah like I was in

the Underdark

I oh man so easy it's still menacing des

that's correct he has still got the

crown of madness over his head okay i

thrust Simon into des armes okay and I

point its tricks and I say you take care

of them and then I step in front of him

and get in melee with eASIC okay when

you say get in melee are you attacking

him yeah all right

have at it all right he suffered some

wounds at the hands of the eye Spartans

and he was obviously suffered some rooms

at the hand of Paul tunes freezing

sphere you see a look of like severe

distaste on Ellen's face like she does

not want to do this but she knows how

crown of madness works and she knows she

just needs to knock his egg out and she

figures she can bring him back later so

she's trying to attack him with the

intent of knocking him unconscious okay

and she's had you know she has the

hardest Vannelli out so I guess that's

what she's using and that's gonna be an

18 that's a hit all right that's a lot

that's let's see four normal damage plus

four fire damage plus four so eight

eight normal plus four fire damage which

is a twelve very poorly rolled okay yeah

you hit him you get another attack if

you want it yeah she takes another swipe

grimacing as she does 15:50 has a hit uh

that is Oh Oh 13 that's 21 uh 21 is

going to hurt him pretty badly actually

music is my boss fight mm-hmm sorry dear

hmm

all right he is he's definitely bloodied

and looking quite hurt Simon got pawned

off 2df Simon will let's see I guess

he'll just take DF by the hand and hold

on and the paltin what would you like to

do okay so the rings gone the ring is

gone disconnect what the hell happened

where is so the ring is Miranda gone you

see no sign of Miranda and you didn't

see any sign of Miranda just prior to

the ring disappearing are the you see no

sign of the shadow Kai assassins you're

standing just inside the doorway

everybody now is outside except you so

I'm just gonna immediately break

concentration on the crown of madness

the crown collapses hey sorry about that

hitting you looks like you're fine now

he looks mad yes Alden is just kind of

sitting there just like with the like

the thousand-yard stare

okay just grabs a grabs a frost lime to

chair and plops down in it and then

that's the turn okay

Miranda is gone Lord Nile is gone DF

okay there's no ice army eASIC still

looks threatening even though the crown

over his head is collapsed probably

because he's not a nice guy and he just

got whacked by evil in twice yeah

I'd still you'd still consider him a

threat right it's fine go to Strix uh so

then hystrix is inside no she is out in

the snow with you Oh looks like she got

literally hold out by some invisible

rapes that's right okay it's just like

it's just it's almost like the the

tavern just coughed her out yeah I guess

like after kind of taking you Simon from

evil and he'll like Cosette Simon down

take Simon's hand but then he like goes

over to Strix wherever she is and it's

just like pull or out of the snow

yeah it's like tries like touch her to

make sure she's even real or actually

she feels real um I'm they're real but

please stop grabbing at me I was in the

Underdark you're muted cherry

yeah website I was like just what and

then yes he'll just pull her to her feet

and then oh I keep himself in like a

defensive position keep Simon nearby as

well and just has no idea what's

actually a real or what's actually

happening and what he needs to respond

to and is just trying to make sense of

it all got it like it was the contract

again you remember that don't you

Strix it is actually your turn dude gets

very angry

um and I can see eASIC yes looks like

he's going to lay a smackdown on evylyn

no no no

can I just polymorph him please sir

please

and he's got to make a wisdom saving

throw he's -1 on that say hey oh yeah

well he rolled up my roll the 13 minus 1

is 12 that's not enough what are you

pouring them into I'm gonna polymorph

him into one of those chickens with the

big fluffy tails that are really long

got a really long tail

okay prolly morphed into tail chicken

got it please no all right it's not

hopping around in the snow you can I'm

equally furious strikes is like and also

I met those people that we exchange

gifts with for some reason and they were

nicer and this time

oh you saw them how was the house Rose

nice everyone oh wait oh he gave me a

hug so that was nice we are technically

out of initiative at least for the next

hour while Isaac is a chicken as you

look around and survey the scene apart

from the ice sculptures that aren't

going anywhere you can see that the

assassins left behind their coach and

their ogre zombie who is still strapped

to the front of the coach with his big

hook hand staring off stupidly into

space and there is you see after a

survey of the surroundings there's no

sign of Miranda or the shadow Kai

anywhere or the straw doll or the straw

doll but we see that all of the have

stopped so there's some indication that

Paulson may have changed his mind so

even one gets this this hopeful look on

her face and she peeks in the door she

sees palton sitting in a frost-covered

chair with a thousand-yard stare kind of

looking through the doorway past you

ward and you can't again again you're

repelled by the ward on the doorway

she's just pressed up against the world

like

do you have a change of heart palsy

sleep why is it so cold I got a Tony

three that's excellent so you believe

that these glyphs that hang on this

tavern protect it from so not protected

they allow only evil to enter and you

believe that you were able to enter the

first time because you had the straw

puppet on you ah and Paulson still in

there paltin that's true he is still in

there because he still has some of the

ice in the veins

I heard the ring which is now gone well

strikes will turn back to everyone else

and just be like hey he's still it's

these prevent evil from going in there I

wasn't evil I was holding the doll

please don't think I'm evil but the last

thing that I am please don't hate me

even as you're sort of waiting here you

can feel sort of the the aura over this

establishment trying or waiting to kind

of thrust you out when evil in here is

that this repels repulses evil and that

paltin still in there and then that must

mean he's evil she's kind of like ah

like shocked and steps back like

districts if Xerxes that she's like just

talk to him evil and please he's gonna

like I'm just gonna get up yeah and just

like I feel it wanting to push me out

and I rather just get out on my own

court okay you you emerge even steps

back like this does paltin look like

he's starting to revert back to normal

at all well he's still he's still sort

of pale and thin and black hair is still

there but the sort of the blue veins

running through him those are

dissipating and fading and on my way out

the blue yeah cool you grab some of the

dwarven ale that was brought with you

and take it out and you can see that the

blue lights in his eyes has gone out

and his normal eyes have returned when

he walks out the door past

evylyn and she sees that his eyes are no

longer blue she kind of steps up to him

and like looks closely at his eyes and

then she kind of like touches us a shock

of his black hair and she's like it

looks good on you still just straight

ahead just like walking through snow

walks through snow and kind of just kind

of moves sidles around his frozen

effigies everywhere until he's like just

sort of walking through the the frozen

versions of himself so named some of

them are some of them have toppled but

they're clearly inanimate at this point

she like stops and just like looks at

one

yeah it's staring you back with its

blank icy face he's gonna like chug the

entire thing of ale he's got and then

just take it and and just like smash it

over one of the ice things faces you see

the face ice flake off

Ellen's face looked really hopeful and

then when she sees this and liked it he

has no interest in talking to her he's

just pissed off and now he's drinking

even more her countenance changes to

this look of just like resignation and

disappointment and then she realizes

that she doesn't see Miranda anymore

Miranda she goes inside or she can't go

inside still well strike wall you guys

are doing this Strix is just gonna start

taking those stupid runes off the thing

and just pulling them off and setting

them on fire and she's not able to

actually grasp them really yeah it's

that good of a war she can't even she

had to sturb them or the building proper

she's just gonna keep hitting it with

her staff because she's pissed off but

someone don't make a make a another

intelligence Arcana check Strix 22 okay

you believe that while only evil can

enter the building that only applies

really so much to creatures like youth

a more effective tactic would be to

launch fireballs

in there to bring the building down from

within I mean I've never heard a better

idea so well done is Miranda still in

there you don't know she wasn't in there

she was hanging from that weather vane

thing last time we saw her I'm sorry

field outside the building Strix is

doing it anyway okay so the real Strix

yeah maybe she wasn't maybe she didn't

come with it with you in here who knows

actually you do like getting anger out

she's crying all right as Strix hurl how

many are throwing in there just out of

here us I'm gonna I don't know how like

let's just do like four all right so

fireball fireball goes off inside the

tavern until the entire thing is sort of

blown out and downward into a steaming

pile of burnt timbers and Holly at that

point in time you can see that as it all

collapses in and turns into rubble that

the spell upon it has been destroyed and

now after it's all fallen you can go

into the wreckage and start tearing all

those twigs apart chewing them to pieces

magic than Jim I just know that and now

now there's the state there's just a

smoking pile of gray Timbers and the

remnants of a blackened stone chimney

which has partially collapsed down upon

everything else left I forgot about my

dwarf is he still there he is still in

the tavern okay buried buried under the

wreckage okay um I feel really bad for

him so I'll just like dig him up okay

when you dig him up you see that one of

his arms is broken off Oh God he's kind

of our problem now so we should probably

take him with us

you think you think amending cantrip

might be enough to rely broken arm all

right if you have such a thing I don't

have that

even just kind of watches her like cuz

she even had this like hope that there

was gonna be some sort of beautiful

magical Disney happy ending and then

that obviously wasn't the case and she's

kind of like you know this is because

she has no idea what's real anymore so

she just like is complete realizes that

nothing she hopes for is happening

she doesn't even know what's real and

what's not and she just watches Strix

destroy this building and does not move

and so just like fire

shrapnel like oh and she's just kind of

standing there with one side of her

covered with this and watching Strix do

that standing dear after her like Bolton

starts smacking up ice Bolton mm-hmm

d/f kind of like tugs on Simon's hand a

little just like come on and then well

like hold Simon sanity them back to

palton okay he's getting it in hand yep

Paulin when you sort of you hear the

crunching of snow behind you and you see

des standing there with Simon who's

who's smiling yeah and then as soon as

we get close enough death will come out

kneeled down like like let go

Simon's hand it was kind of like you

know just like Tania direct him to get

back to paltin yeah Simon will rush

toward you palton and just sort of

tackle your kneecaps he just looks at

him doesn't really say anything but is

acknowledging just like right one hand

on the head and Simon's been away from

you for a good long time this is the

longest he's been away from you recently

so he's not letting go anytime soon oh

just it's just staring yeah a lot of

staring going on and then it is cold out

here yeah Jesus Christ

alright and dear full of sand back up

and just kind of shrugged his shoulders

just be like kept him safe for you and

then we'll return back towards the evil

intense tricks you see DF paulten kind

of

delivering Simon say that and turn away

heading did you find Miranda dia oh

and then diesel started looking around

for Miranda I'm sure he's really looking

for was Miranda real Brandon was real

right Miranda see Miranda - didn't we

have a friend called Miranda at one

point strikes is just looking for

portals at this point she's like there's

gotta be a way out of here uh what

didn't you have a ring before Fulton

let's how did that you still got one you

still got one ring palton and that's the

ring of protection that protects you

from the death curse I'm gonna how far

has deaath gotten from me wait who's not

who's not who's being affected by the

death curse right now uh the only one

who would be ejected is yeah because

he's not wearing a ring yeah he looks

considerably more fucked-up you last saw

him yes I'm gonna I'll take that ring

off yeah and just like throw it to him

hey and then can I can I use locate

creature to see if Miranda is nearby

sure let me just check the range

I think it's housing yeah you're right a

thousand feet of you you do not sense

Miranda within a thousand feet of you

waffles is here right yeah waffles is

still here you talked you told her to

stand pat you whistle for her call for

her she will come barreling through the

snow oh yeah she was I told her to stay

and she was sitting there with toffee

yeah yeah she'll come barreling over to

you and her face is just covered with

snow

no that must have been fun for her yeah

knock some of it off yes it'll take a

glove off and slide that ring on okay

you feel better

Pullman's gonna look to Strix if she

still she's still going going ham on

that fire is that like kind of settled

she's just staring at the dwarf now

going I'm like trying to put his arm

back on yeah let's see where it's

supposed to go that's not that's not

hard but you can't just you don't think

you can just glue it back on you need to

use your magic bones gonna turn his

strikes just like what did you do

what do you mean what did I do did you

do just now you did something the ring

was gone

and the elves were gone well the elves I

don't know I was gonna cut your finger

off but I didn't because you're my

friend I'm just saying I didn't happen I

had a pocket watch that stopped time and

she like pretends and and this dwarf oh

I was told they were supposed to help us

and I think if the elves are gone my

guess is that it did not work for elves

I did not know that

seriously it was given to you by an elf

it was given to me by an elf I did not

know I did not know that I was being

manipulated I just wanted to help you

guys I wanted to help you yes you're my

family

I'm sorry the rings going but it was

evil well I'm just like we need to get

that ring back no we don't and we might

know and we need to destroy it

no well we can destroy it it that do not

exist I mean I'm glad you agree now so

someone's gonna figure out where it went

because that oh I can help that was

 evil ins very excited she was

like he was saying they need to get the

ring back she looks super sad and then

she he said that they needed to destroy

it and her eyes lit up and she cast

locate object jerks is like we're in the

shadow fell everything's okay the

ring is not within 1,000 feet of you

never mind I can't help I don't know

what's real deatha kind of walk up and

up to evil inside at this point and like

subtly would like to back his hand down

towards her waist or just kinda like tap

on her but basically tapping right where

she was keeping the Sun sword help she

gives it to him but like holds it she

like is handing it to him do you like

you put in DF like looks at her and kind

of like motions defaulting she goes it

belongs to him she looks at it

she was in gingerly and she goes he just

kind of looks at like thanks

now can we figure out where that where

they went what happened

where it is dude can you track them or

anything I'll try

and then they'll kind of scout the

perimeter for anything that looks like

footprints within snow it should be

relatively easy I just go through the

snow and look around you can see yeah

that there that three sets of footprints

went off in a direction down one of the

roads and you can also see you find Lord

Nile in the snow he looks like he was

cut down back stabbed even you find is

he like dead dead yep musics two guards

also dead

the vez tani gypsy wagon is they the the

the tracks seem to go there and then the

wagon takes over and leaves so the three

people got into the Bustani wagon and

left how happened is that the same is

that the same wagon that music came in

okay so that wasn't the way it's not

it's not the meathook wagon that one is

still at the near the wreckage of the

tavern so the shadow kite left their old

crappy shitty zombie pulled wagon and

took the one pulled by the horses that

Isaac brought and apparently they

weren't alone

cuts to Miranda you are sitting in the

coach with your two new shadow kai

friends and you've got the ring it is

speaking to you in a lovely elven accent

telling you of the the great one

that it has seen in the hands of so many

but never has it fallen into the hands

of one quite so beautiful and charming

and gifted in the arts of nature as

yourself

and it tells you how it was used to help

facilitate the change of seasons and to

bring about the beauty of winter and you

still have your face because the shadow

Chi were merely joking and it was a good

laugh and you are in the you are in the

comfortable

Lavar dough is guiding the wagon up top

but you're in back with marie siena and

there is some dwarven ale in here which

she finds repulsive she just sort of

feeds that up to levar dough to keep him

warm while he's guiding the horses

onward you've left the snowy region that

palton created his domain has sort of

collapsed in of itself and you are

moving away with them under the

agreement that the ring will never fall

into the waffle crews hands again I'd

like to find some string or ribbon or

something and tie the ring around my

neck okay yeah so just sort of hangs

there you can feel it as it touches your

neck the the cold of the shadow fell

does not seem to affect you at all

just just contact what the ring is

enough to grant you that you also feel

like the ring is definitely safer in

your hands than anybody else's and the

shadow kai seem of a mind to agree with

you both narayana and levar doe says

that they will help you any way they can

to get you where you need to go do I

know where to take it north north north

we'll go north and that's where we'll

stop thought your face was gone that was

real scary they only take the faces of

those they've been sent to kill but they

do like to play I hate them all right I

have a funny funny feeling we're gonna

see Miranda again Oh golly but I want to

thank Rachel for making it so far so

long and and doing the impossible your

face now it's fine the cold never

bothered you anyway got WAY worse oh by

the way Miranda as you're traveling

north occasionally you do see Raven

sightings so somebody somebody's

somebody's watching you watching out for

you all right so yeah I hadn't I had no

idea of how that was gonna play out holy

smiles I didn't get to cut his finger

off that would definitely crimp his bag

paper bag by playing what he said he was

bad anyway so plantain was actually even

willing to cut off the hand at that

point there was a lot there was a lot

Walton has all his fingers and a driving

burning desire to see the ring of winter

destroyed utterly perhaps perhaps the

waffle crew will find the way to do that

that would be pretty intense because

there is there is a way but it's not a

well-known way like all artifacts

there's one way to destroy something oh

good cool how many dozen of all the

mountain is it

we're not identical does they go 12

rituals that have very steep

repercussions that were about who knows

a future story to be told a future story

to be told

[Music]

does anybody have any announcements

they'd like to share

hi oh yeah you go first

cuz you kept your face girls skirts

Gloria's back actually this Sunday yeah

up and I made a bunch of mistakes and I

don't care right your game your game

right and what I'm sorry what's that

podcast called Rachel other things going

third session as D&D playing the lost

minds of fan delvar which is the fifth

edition starter set Adventure has the

power gone to your head yet I you know I

think I have not let it go to my head

enough so that's my plan for this

episode I'm learning a ton every episode

you know like you go into it thinking

that being a DM is one thing and then

you learn it's not so you go all the way

to the other thing and then you realize

that wasn't really where you should be

either so now you know third session

hopefully I've learned a lot and I think

today will be really fun and then also

I'll let Holly talk about our game that

we put on Thursdays but I'm in that one

so watch that on this channel and then

not the in dealer D&D related but like

my entire life is revolving around it on

idea what we're doing any thoughts on

domesticus items finish off soul moans

stop dying stop dying and death curse I

think is like primary not girl bye mercy

killers very crippling existential

crisis yeah we all got one next session

work things out as a group now that

you're sort of re centered and you got

the party and there are outstanding

questions things happening

existentially and otherwise so I look

forward to seeing what that episode

actually manifests into we don't know

what's real and what's a nod right and

waffle crew get out with their senses
