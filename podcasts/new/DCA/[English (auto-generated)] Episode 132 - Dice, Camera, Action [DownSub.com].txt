hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action our D&D show exactly Before we

jump into the recap I just want to

welcome Brooks Donahoe first donohue

Donahue first coming to us on our show I

was gonna call you sister in a rye but

actually that's your character's name

yeah to reiterate nailed it yes and so

Brooks will get to you in just a second

we gonna get through the recap then

we're going to do some off crew business

and then we'll see what sister Mariah

has been up to swag thank you previously

and diced camera action not long after

the waffle crew returned to Waterdeep

deaath was confronted by dwarves who

held him personally responsible for the

deaths of over 50 of their kind in an

unfortunate incident involving an iron

flask and a fire primordial and as part

of the recompense for that crime they

instructed death that they were counting

on him to recover a trove of dwarven

gold hidden away somewhere in the city

of Waterdeep and over the course of the

season the characters have come into

contact with various other individuals

who have expressed an interest or desire

to obtain said gold and struck up

alliances with them to one extent or

another including alliances with the

santarem the castle enter family a noble

family with devil-worshiping tendencies

and a the drow leader of the brigand

earth one Jarl axel Bain Rea Jarl axel

of course suggesting a partnership the

castle enters seeking a partnership so

that they can use the money to save the

children whose souls they dammed in

exchange for power years ago and the

centaurum because hey there shady

sinister shadow empire who thinks gold

is great but the party has had some good

contacts with his aunt arm in the past

not all of them seem to be bad eggs and

at least one of their evil leaders

mention is dead when last we left the

waffle crew they were in their house the

top floor of which had exploded and so

the house is kind of a mess kind of does

that leave any floors unexploded the

first floor the second floor in the

third and well the first in the second

floor are habitable at this point the DF

also set out with strict C's help and a

little bit of moral support from Jarl

axel to reconstruct evil ins ax light

fall which has been shattered since

season two and now evil and you have

this weapon in your hands and holding it

for five or ten minutes or so you can

attune to it and you haven't attuned to

it in a long time so you feel its warmth

course through you

once the attunement takes hold and you

you discover what its other powers are

which is while you're not carrying a

shield like on your hands arms you gain

a +1 bonus to your AC while holding

light fall with one hand or a +2 bonus

to your AC if you're holding it with

both hands essentially using it as a

deflection tool as well as a weapon also

when you hit a creature with the weapon

and deal radiant damaged such as from

your divine smite the excess radiance

can be turned into rays of healing that

is in addition to its normal effect up

to six creatures of your choice within

30 feet of you regain one D 10 hit

points what well as rays as rays spring

out of the weapon and strike them full

of healing energy and finally you can

cast the spell Sunbeam from the weapon

but after doing so light fall must spend

one hour recharging in the sunlight to

regain that ability

and Sunbeam is kind of a badass sixth

level stuff better than Moonbeam it's it

creates a beam of a brilliant light that

Springs from the weapon in a five foot

wide 60 foot long cone and creatures in

line must make a constitution saving

throw if they fail to save they take 68

radiant damage and are blinded until

your next turn and on a successful save

they take half damage and aren't blinded

and undead and oozes oddly enough have

disadvantage on the saving from ill

growth so it's like kind of comparable

in some ways to Thunder way and the best

part of it is you can then continue to

create new lines of radiance as your

action on subsequent turns for up to a

minute Sun beam pew pew yeah exactly

the relight is also considered to be

sunlight so creatures that have

particular aversions and things to

sunlight don't like the spell sick

evylyn has been playing with this

non-stop and just shouting at the earth

when she figures out new things they can

do yeah periodically there are like

people walking around outside and this

stray beam of brilliant sunlight will

just rock it out of a window or yeah so

you always the the group received an

invitation

later later on let's say for argument's

sake the next day you get a visitor who

shows up on your doorstep and he's kind

of dressed like a wizard got wizardly

rubs on he's a maybe 20 something 25 28

ish year old young man with spectacles

looks very intelligent and

he's kind of soft-spoken introduces

himself as and of our Sun breeze he says

he is

lady Rajan Aras proxy in charge of

running the auction and he comes with a

package which he sets down on a table

and you can see that it contains

clothing and masks the clothing are all

burgundy very stylish burgundy robes

that can be worn over other apparel

there are hats and cowls and high

collars on the robes and Harlequin masks

to conceal faces so that fully garbed

you look like somebody out of Eyes Wide

Shut there's there's no easy way to

recognize who the wearer is unless they

speak or betray themselves in some other

way so it is part of like the auction

the way that kind of runs was kind of

anonymous

he says effectively that yes in order to

guarantee the anonymity of the bidders

and the potential winner these costumes

can be worn you may opt not to of course

but I guarantee you some of the other

auction attendees will be wearing them

because no one wants to attract undue

attention yeah definitely wouldn't want

that I think we'll probably wear them if

everyone else is okay with that

doesn't even think they are pretty they

are very dramatic it's like once when

Evelyn was a little girl she may have

gone to a theater and watched a

performance with a choir and all the

choir singers were dressed in these

garments so they all looked the same and

just their voices and Anvar makes it

clear you don't have to wear it now he

just prior to the auction this evening

he or someone else appointed by him is

going to come by and usher you to the

auction location by magic well it was

just like I dig it he'll just wear it

now okay I mean I'm strict so I really

have a choice so she'll probably just

wear it okay no know how she's gonna

hide her hair under it yep and var says

he has to make other stops in the city

to other attendees but he does give you

the opportunity to ask him any questions

you might have about the auction before

he departs there's no rules against

bringing coal that seems smart will

there be on-site guards or protection in

case an altercation were to break out he

says the individuals who will be running

the auction will be well protected it

will be up to the bidders to take care

of their own great and what's like the

catering look like he says we have the

best catering I guess that'll do so the

auction itself is it like a silent

auction where we kind of put down how

like our top amount we're willing to pay

or is it like a live it's a live bidding

auction and everyone will be given signs

with numbers on them

you'll pick the sign when you arrive

that will be your number and when you

hold the sign up it will be an

indication to the auctioneer that you

are bidding the bidding is set to start

at ten thousand gold pieces increasing

by five thousand gold pieces with each

bid until we hit one hundred thousand

gold pieces if that happens the bids

will then increase by twenty five

thousand gold piece increments in

question about that

are we able to pick our numbers yes the

signs will be ready they'll be waiting

for you at the location the earlier you

arrive the more number choices you will

have fantastic anyone else that we know

gonna be there like is any of the City

Guard gonna be there or anyone from

acquisitions incorporated or a new

announced that of note no group that is

attending the auction knows who else has

been invited these masks

in a no I guess more meta way did evylyn

and paltin actually end up finishing

that transaction with the insurance

cloak so they still have the cloak they

ended up taking it back with them with

the understanding that some paperwork

would be delivered for them to review

essentially a contract they would review

it and if they were happy with the terms

of the contract then it could proceed so

that means they're waiting on that okay

so now we don't suddenly have 50,000

additional gold pieces we could use not

yet great and I still have it right you

saw up yes absolutely great Astrix is

wondering if they need her to be

invisible and just go around and maybe

like prestidigitators so that they say

the wrong thing that actually was

something I was considering I don't know

yet all right she's just gonna sit there

and offer her totally dishonest services

[Laughter]

it's a good idea though a lot to see how

this goes all right mom

she says that there's no good thing that

she can do in any sort of situation that

involves outfits this fancy so well I'll

let you know I will be at your service

if there are no more questions then I

will take my leave and as I said either

I or another designated representative

will be back later today to teleport or

rather use a teleportation circle spell

to transport to the auction location

sounds lovely

wait I have a question before you leave

he looks at you attentively everyone

else has their questions because I have

I have a last question for him yep Alton

have at it for me good sir

could you have a good day yes I shall

thank you then no further questions and

he'll leave can I take this brief moment

to ask another question about lightful

yes absolutely and it did an additional

2d6 radiant damage against fiends or

undead does it still do that it still

has all of its original properties all

the original okay cool great yep and

there is no equivalent weapon to this in

like existing D&D items that I've

already beyond okay cool correct thank

you yours is unique all right so is

there anything in particular you want to

just in summary like to do before you

are whisked away this evening

sure you hear the kids stomping around

upstairs maybe take care of that

what DF yes I have a request

what is it we need to keep the cloak

safe and guarded yeah before the

paperwork comes in as to not lose out on

this and I quote a sload of money we are

going to get right do you have like a

like some kind of secured chest or

container or like box that like locks up

and I feel like you'd be the guy hardly

paltin no I don't not anymore mmm

disappointing sure thanks maybe you

could put it in some sort of other like

dimension or something uh I can't do

that you should make it a chicken and I

mean I can just wear it

why don't you just let me wear it I'll

just put it on that is a fantastic idea

no it's won't attuned to me even though

it's evil won't do anything it just

won't work

cuz I'm not evil at least as far as I

know I'm not evil I might be am i evil

fling check she puts her hand to her

forehead like a mom it's like as much as

I hate myself I must be evil

no no not evil I would know it's okay

you still got time but for now cloak

we're good arty

okay Strix we'll put it on not that

she's no stranger to multiple layers

yeah don't put on that and the other

outfit on top of it sure she feels

strangely kind of burdened by it but

she'll be fine yeah gross I don't like

it it's itchy yeah that's very and I

inform everyone that evil is itchy

it wasn't bothering paulten no I don't

know yeah like a fiend yes yeah so I'll

put that on and and then I put my other

garments on top of it yes the the more

theatrical garments that have been

provided to you are very light they

don't they hardly weigh anything as you

toss the the gown over you with the high

collar and as you fit the Hat on you

won't be able to wear your hats tricks

and the hats now that accompanies this

no I don't I just wear the hat for the

that's for the outfit okay I am gonna

complain that the robe is going to Jim

though and just say that we need to take

the collar off because he doesn't need

that sort of fanciful fanciful

accoutrement to add to his already giant

tall ego yes I agree say however this

Jim wants to wear it is totally is

totally they're called they are the

purchaser so I I just I just want it to

be sold in the condition that it was

sold in I don't want to show up with

last-second revisions I'll make sure to

sweatin it a lot perfect yeah we

probably charge for that all right any

other business

wait do you want me to do the legal

thing or not look here's the thing I

know we're going in here and everyone's

expecting me to have a plan how we could

handle this to make sure we get the

stone of galore

and I'm gonna level with you guys I got

nothing we can switch it out for a fake

that would require creating a fake and

limited amount of time at the same time

the last thing I wanted to do is somehow

draw the ire of both Durrell Axl or the

castle lanters because as far as either

party knows I'm helping them

but that's shouldn't be our goal the one

thing that we really need to make sure

is that neither one of them end up with

that stone wake back up back up back up

back up

stone of good what now the stone of

galore a special artifact of sorts it's

somehow a key to getting people into the

under mountain to find this treasure

hoard of hundreds of thousands of gold

pieces

what if last resort just saying if I'm

wearing this robe I could alter myself

to look like a man soon and then steal

it and be like boohoo I'm man soon when

the works are not I could just recall

myself back to our house with the stone

and everyone be like oh no mansion stole

it the only flaw with this I could

possibly think of is that don't people

know mansion is dead no he had a bunch

of clones oh that's so true now there

was like four mansion I don't know

I actually don't hate that plan I think

it's great it's low oh no I am mansion

as long as you think you can pull it off

and get yourself out of there safely I

don't care I mean I wouldn't consider

this like you know this is something

we're doing for good right yet this

isn't just like lying and stealing right

as far as I understand it I admit that's

a little complicated for me with all

these people and keeping track of who's

evil and who's not right I mean I don't

consider either one of them to be you

know worthy of all this money and

besides that that money doesn't belong

to them right well in this case it's

like a you know rightful place kind of

situation right the money needs to go to

the right place right and so does this

stone of Gabor right not to point it out

but as I was putting up that idea Chris

was smiling a little bit too much I'm

glad he's happy anyway yeah so that's my

idea so you know that is while I got

putting myself in harm's way for

everyone else it's a good idea Strix and

definitely keep that in mind cuz it

might come to that all right if then

just give me a wink or something when

it's time to turn it the mansion

underneath my other outfit and walk up

to the stone and be like ooh and then

leave okay I'll give you a signal you'll

know okay all right that's our back-up

plan all right sounds good

then if there is no other business the

day passes you clean up the house a

little bit at least try to make the

downstairs presentable so that people

can come back in buy stuff and the pub

is there yeah we also make sure that

they also kind of keep an eye on the

kids too

okay I was gonna ask how you're gonna

babysit the kids this time they can they

could definitely do that yeah I'll tell

dear no she's in charge okay and then

but no killing no killing no fair fair

okay and var returns at about I'm gonna

say six spells six pm and asks you if

you're ready to go yeah Reverend make

sure we're dressed up in our robes and

masks first okay like although she's

supposed to look like everyone else very

obviously has a giant shield on her back

underneath her robe and a giant battle

axe like sticking out through the neck

hole mounted on her back is she also

like oddly like floating in place a

little bit like the bottom of her robes

like screeches yeah because all of a

sudden she's actually like an average

height but that's she seems to be kind

of like floating at that average height

and then since you're all dressed up in

your costumes and I love the idea that

the bottom of evil ins rubs it sort of

billows kind of because her feet aren't

actually touching the ground

metal champions just drifts just got

Bob's and Anvar says he needs to

inscribe a circle on the floor if that's

all right he'll do it in chalk so it can

be cleaned off oh the top petition

circles yeah yeah that's fine right fine

so how it works

I mean at this point I'm not worried

about the floors my recall spell that's

fine no hit he tells he assures you it

will not okay and then he once he

completes that and that takes him about

a minute he then puts the chocks away

and pulls out some precious stones and

[Music]

begins casting the spell with all of you

standing in the circle together you are

suddenly whisks away teleported into a

chamber that is made of stone it looks

like a quarter of a hemisphere so one

long wall kind of has a rounded quality

and arcs up toward a point on the

ceiling and then there are two

flat walls that converge at 90-degree

angles so it does kind of look like if

you were to look at this room top down

it would look like the quarter of a

circle there is a door on the arcing

circular outer wall also made of stone

with some wizardly runes carved into it

it looks super super fancy the circle

that you appear in is similar to the one

you left but a little bit more care and

time was taken in its design so that it

would kind of it looks more like a

permanent or semi-permanent fixture here

the room is decorated with tapestries

there are two other exits besides the

ornate door one on each of the flat

walls and one of those exits is blocked

by a pair of statues that have Hal birds

actually crossed such that they're right

in front of the door basically blocking

it but the other exit is thrown wide

open and you can see a larger

semicircular chamber or roughly

semicircular chamber beyond that voices

are coming out of as well as music and

it seems like a gathering area for the

guests you can smell food and wine and

you can see tables covered with

tablecloths and all sorts of decorations

including what appeared to be ice

sculptures I'm like a hundred and ten

percent doing the whole like grandma

putting snacks in her purse thing just

like taking like you know just putting

them in there

there are valets in this room who are

there to address any needs you might

have there's sort of standing on each

side of the open double door and inside

the room you catch a glimpse of Amalia

castle enter kind of leaning over and

looking at some food we can tell it

urges and she is not in costume that's a

power play yeah it sure is

and then you see some of the servants in

there as well and you hear voices of

other people in the room but you don't

see them alright yet what's the plan

what are we doing I told you I don't

know add var says if you will kindly

just stand to the side of the circle I

have to leave and collect some more

guests oh yeah sorry sorry will step out

of circle sorry yeah also I'm holding

the staff of power right now too so like

just in case like I'm just like yeah I'm

real fancy mage you don't know who's

under here maybe it's van shoed I if

possible in my outfit I actually would

like to have put the cape of billowing

under the road oh sure

so that occasionally while I'm staying

there I could just make it like fair

awesome each one of you will be very

recognizable

I'm so glad who are you talking about so

none of us know who anyone here is oh

yes indeed

good sir impeccable well the first thing

we need to do is first thing we should

try to do is maybe figure out where the

stone itself is don't know what stone

real jewelry or this is painful for me

so I'm going to walk away and just like

silently listen to everyone or just like

act like I'm eating snacks and just try

it out over here people all right when

you walk through the double doors into

the larger room leaving your accent

accented friends behind you see

immediately floating just your little

god

you pass by a table that has a number of

numbered signs they're basically sticks

with numbers at the top of them on

placards a very decorative looking with

little gold filigree frames and you can

see that they're all sort of laid out in

numerical order in multiple rows are

people taking them already or does it

seem like we're waiting it doesn't look

like anybody has taken a number yet one

there one is there even takes one what

is the number arranged Chris one 268 no

I'm just kidding 60 the numbers go up to

24 hmm I will I will take can I take 12

yeah I like grabs 12 like mutters to

himself there's like 12 looks around

he's like no one's gonna get that oh

okay and var will say before he

disappears in the circle that you can

either take one number to represent your

group or if you plant a bit individually

you can have multiple numbers and you

don't have to take them now you can wait

until just before the auction begins and

then he starts casting his spell to

leave

I'll probably just wait to see what's

left over okay well currently there's 2

through 11 and 13 through 24 yeah okay

I'll probably wait closer to the actual

sure you do strix when you walk into the

room you can see that there are multiple

tables spread

over the area this room is also part of

what seems to be a very much larger

sphere or hemisphere that this building

is shaped in you can see that apart from

the resplendent displays of food and the

rugs and the tapestries and all the

other adornments servants walking around

with platters that have wine flutes on

them there are a number of figures who

have already arrived

none of them are wearing the costumes

what so we're just wearing these

costumes and no one else is apparently

everybody else who's here right now

elected to come as they are whatever and

you can fool so you can see some

familiar faces including the castle

enters Victoria and Amalia you see near

Victoria is his tall tiefling manservant

to the snooty fellow who mistook you

once for a chimney sweep

you also see a number of other familiar

faces including Sentara members that you

met at the docks early in the campaign

oh yeah including a dark-skinned dwarf

in gold armor whose name escapes you

sure does a Sun elf bard and his female

half-orc bodyguard and sister dinner I

can't remember sister narai yes when

last you saw sister narai she was

helping you at the Waffle House defend

against as an authoritarian array of

persons actually thank you and sister

narai you see this veil this veiled

figure with a staff and two more or

three more enter behind that person all

dressed the same

and your retinue opted against the

costumes simply because it's 'tried

being a dwarf didn't feel like she was

fooling anybody okay so uh so our and

can I roll so see if I clear Lee

recognize me can I roll to see if I

recognize these guys here I recognize as

they start to pour into the room you can

make an insight check to see if there is

anything about them that might betray

who they are

no there's they're kind of strange but

other than that you haven't put the

pieces together yet as the rest of you

look around the room and a recognized

sister narai and the members of this

entire arm and the castle enters you

also see that sister and her I was up

until this moment talking to a male

dwarf with bad fire scars on his face

and body and deaath you recognize him as

Kaz great dragon he'll the survivor of

iron slag do you know I can't remember

who you met who was actually at the

said they wouldn't kill me I say that

series distraction force and you and

Strix orchestrate the stones dealing a

great start before anything else where

fancy dinner party we ready yeah mm-hmm

check to see if he cracks these disguise

of yours

you opposed by his insight ah

so 22 okay he says

he kind of he kind of hears you then

smiles and says ah very good you've

arrived excellent and I see you brought

your friends D F isms dear Woodrow right

alright I got that wrong I knew not of

who you speak darling start stirring the

way my trust you've had a few days now

to consider our arrangement a possible

deal what we can do for you because a

lot of family is influential as I said

and of course this is for our children

well I'm just kind of and then you can

actually hear him say out loud to the

teeth League I'm not sure we can count

on them yeah that's like like turn

around and be like yes you can all right

you're gonna cast the spell yeah no if

you can't even take getting read without

throwing out a suggestion spell man

what's the safe DC is would you say my

hand from hell is on my person that's

entirely up to you okay I'd love to know

where on your person it is but yes we

can say it like I would like tucked like

into like my belt or something he's just

like kind of hooked onto a belt we got

it yeah absolutely

mmm why wouldn't you bring your hand to

a party I don't yeah exactly so so with

the hand

it's a wisdom 20 okay you cast the spell

it does not take hold

and I would like at least you for the

moment to roll initiative because I

don't think anybody else really get a

sense of what's going on yet no I was

gonna say before this happened that I

was already a rat like I am already a

rat as soon as like it was like we need

to record since I'm like I'm gone I

can't talk to these people without so

you know you just sort of you disappear

essentially down into rat farm and like

crawl around a table like yes

underneath the tablecloth I'm just

trying to find where the stone is

got it so paulten what was your

initiative 18 18 oops now you got honest

what do you do when you realize the

spell hasn't taken hold and Victoire Oh

seems first of all aghast and then

really really his face goes from

surprise to blistering anger EGH

I tell him I like so I'm still like

pretty close to him right yeah yeah and

you also you can also realize now

because he's a half-elf you think he's

actually super resistant to charms I'm

just like like all right look I'm so

sorry I just I just have to play into

this role it doesn't have to do with you

we are absolutely looking forward to

working with you it's this I this is

just something that like needs to be

played up just like play along they're

watching but it's okay it's okay where

we are in this together

don't worry you have my word okay and

that's your action yeah is that as that

anything I'll give him the entire plan

is that action yeah you can make another

deception check oh my god I'm trying to

prepare um no you're deceiving him oh

okay cool great okay

so that is a 27 okay

mm-hmm sorry your complex motives and

twisted plots confuse him for a moment

and then suddenly the anger disappears

the anger appeared on his face it

disappears and he just laughs very good

because I was about to banish you I do

that in the right mind you know suggest

to us and while this is going on the

rest of you could see that Amalia Kessel

letter has maneuvered herself behind

Paulding not very close but close enough

that should her husband give her any

sign any signal even so much as a wink

she would snuff him out can even come up

with a drink and be like yes sir all of

this Strix and constriction DF go in

like opposite direction for recon

yeah Strix you see is yes scuttling away

on the floor yeah just whatever just

dispersed Strix rats around and I'll

kind of like maneuver through crowds and

try to over here and try to kind of get

a vibe for what everyone's intent is

okay that's an inside check and it's a

perception check for you Strix to see if

I can notice anything from your new

ultra-low that's right you can i quick

check-in so so it sounds like paltin and

oh god paladin the other yes thank you

are together and then Strix and eos kind

of veered off correct correct they're

both so it's

three crucifix and after both alone as

opposed to well you don't see Strix

because she kind of just appeared but do

okay yeah or who you might assume as DF

coz there there are the three of them

that you can see you're still costumed

okay I mean sensible yeah you probably

put it together yeah by now you buy the

book by the way they move and the fact

that DF hasn't said anything yet

probably means that's him okay alright

yeah seventh so DF what was your role in

fact was eighteen with that you can see

that people basically here who aren't

servants are just waiting impatiently

for the auction to begin they just want

to get the stone and and get out okay

but it sounds like pretty much everyone

here or the stone yes absolutely

everyone here nobody here seems to be

here for any other reason that you can

ascertain damn okay Strix what was your

role ah six okay your rat side view

gives you basically a good look at

people's boots and boot buckles okay and

you can look up their garment no I don't

do that right but you don't see much on

the floor the floor is absolutely

cleaned there's there's there's no sign

of the stone down here alright or hidden

underneath the table say or anything

like that no sign of the stone

whatsoever can I cast as a rat or no no

because you have to be able to do the

components of the spell okay well maybe

this one doesn't need it let me see um

because I wanted to cast detect magic

does it have well would have some

components you can't speak as a rat you

can't somatic component as a rat and you

can use material components in your

current form because your material

opponents are absorbed okay can I turn

back into myself under a table you

absolutely can do that okay I monitor a

table now as myself and I'm gonna cast

the tech magic to try and find the stone

okay cistern awry you see this like end

of a staff sort of stick out from

underneath okay

whoops strict says

can I use like could I like use like why

did my my deflect missiles to catch the

end of I mean clearly this spell gets

cast but could I stash the end of the

staff and what kind of table to see who

whose staff that is yeah you're just

excited let me take a look I'll just

I'll lift up the tablecloth yeah you see

Strix is like casting a spell under

there she hasn't noticed you yet all

right I

so Neriah is going to look under the

table and just kind of poke her head

down and say what the hell are you doing

I'm trying to find the stupid stone of

Glore things so I can turn into man soon

and take it noted this is going

swimmingly dear as you wander off you

see through the open doors into the

gleaning hall new arrivals and var

appears and is joined by three figures

two women dressed outlandish Lea they

almost kind of look like cabaret dancers

and a man live scantily clad with sort

of so criss-crossing leather straps in

place of a shirt his bare chest and

chest hair visible underneath and tall

thigh high boots you see he's got full

mane of dark of curly hair a handlebar

mustache and a VanDyke beard and he's

got a mug of ale in one hand and a

pirate's hat on the other looks like

he's from wherever evil death was from

and a guitar in the shape of a mystical

symbol right exactly

and he's got these two ladies basically

on his arms when he arrives and the

three of them are just laughing and

having a ball and they come sauntering

in prancing really

they enter the room and they're not

wearing the robes either huh correct

cool in fact you wish they were wearing

more yeah of anything yeah nice and we

were the ones who showed up to the

costume party

that wasn't a costume party in costume

we got got well no it just so happens

that you're in a room with a bunch of

flaming egotists it's the narcissism

pretty much this is the narcissism this

is this is närcon yeah gnar Ciccone not

kind of so different than our second

we'll do he sounds fabulous and I will

do my best to knock in his wares

attention at all okay even will grab

lady castle enter and swing her and be

like look at that dish I'm really glad

you said out of it really glad you said

dish yeah

because I went my brain went somewhere

completely else oh that's the difference

between you and I get a volley a sort of

tears herself away it says don't touch

me here have a drink

she swats it down on the floor how dare

you I've never you're ruining a dinner

party helicopter and it's at that point

since you're both fairly close to her

you can see that she wears around her

neck of absolutely stunning gold chain

that has a tiny reliquary almost like a

little vial at the end of it and it

seems to be filled of red fluid like

blood

injuries that on your neck

she says you want ghastly people that

she walks away fair at this point in

time paltin while you distracted the

tiefling manservant has very subtly

handed Victoire oh his walking cane you

can see that it is a resplendent gold

long rod that he uses the walk that has

sort of a glittering ruby on its tip and

Vittorio now has that in his possession

and he says ah that must be captain Zord

I have let's I've been looking so

forward to meeting him

and he walks over to introduce himself

to the new arrival at which point all of

you can see Victoria come over greet

captain Zord they shake hands

captain Zord loudly and boisterously

proclaims why this is the dreariest

party I've ever been to

haha but it's much better now that we're

here oh look at that and he goes over to

this ice sculpture and climbs up on the

table and starts humping it I'm

definitely not looking at this just yeah

I'm out I just like take off the so now

everybody can see paltin I mean I'm

famous here anyway so whatever this

party is you shouldn't be showing your

face that's fine I didn't plan ingress

and egress for your signing look

this whole plan I have no idea where we

expected to go with this and now I'm

tired I'm going to get more wine

you can continue you're doing great

even's like this to the whatever's going

on with the ice sculpture and she goes

over to see if she can find Strix ok

Strix you cast your spell yes there's

staff sticking out of one of the under

the tables yes and at the end of the

spell what happens I mean I'm hoping to

find the stone I want to know where the

stone is okay and it has a range of what

a thousand feet yeah okay it doesn't

register as being anywhere within the

range of the spell okay stupid all right

I just get out from under the table and

stand there and I'm just like gonna wait

until they tell me to take it some more

people arrived these ones are costumed

like you okay good oh thank god and by

then the drunk captain's or it climbs

off off the table realizing writing and

ice sculpture is probably not the most

comfortable thing in the world he he

needs a little help getting off the

table apparently but the two ladies with

him help him down and he goes looking

for some more wine and just happens to

reach for the same glass paltin does

does he like touch it yeah I'm just like

yeah that's all you buddy and he says hi

I'm captain Zord I did not ask and then

he leans in but really I'm an old friend

an old friend

Wow now I like go further wine again

it's like you know what yeah I'm gonna

need that more than you he lets you take

it and

he says we are working together to get

this stone no see all right are you

really asking you're asking me what the

plan is all right how ridiculous of me

and he walks away yeah

gosh like you no no no your demographic

dude do I like see like where I could

suspect that the items for auction are

being like held or secured there's been

no indication that the objects are on

display you've seen notice it lays and

there is there is however apart from the

exit you came through the greeting

chamber there is another closed set of

double doors that no that are haven't

been breached yet so maybe it there

behind there I'm gonna go for those

doors I'm like is there anyone guarding

it or don't you think nope their

servants wandering around but they're

not anywhere near the doors when you go

over and you crack them open you can see

that the room beyond is another quarter

of a circle it sort of completes the

circle on this level and there is an

auction stage to your left and then the

rest of the room are chairs arranged on

a riser it kind of looks like a lecture

hall arranged on a higher riser where

people can sit in rows you bet that this

is probably where the auction is going

to be held but again you don't see any

items on display in here well I was

right about the seating is there like is

there a door yeah and there are they

there are only 24 seats to in the room

there is a there is another door in that

room based on your idea of what the

configuration of this layout is you

think that door leads back around to the

greeting room the it's the door that's

blocked by the statues on the other side

so there's no other exits and there

doesn't really seem like there's

anything else any other like inside

areas or anything like that no and then

there's a couple bathrooms I'm gonna go

back out mm-hmm to who in the who in the

party is like closest strix she's under

a table still but yeah you can see my

staff taking people and already walked

over there to her okay so I'm also like

gonna crawl under the table to just like

okay cool

hey yes

[Music]

there isn't any to buy no we have

to wait for it to start

no like I pretty sure there's like

nothing here oh no did you find anything

do you think this is a trap I didn't

which is probably dumb at this point in

time captain's sword goes over to you

yelling you're still in costume and he

says my deal your splendens is

diminished by these plain robes are you

doing like disguise yes I am oh that's

real nice don't you like it

I I do it's very we're feeling it before

with palton but as usual he got tired of

it and left to do something else so I'm

all alone do you want to do a bit with

me do I hear this no but you sense it

I'm standing right by the table oh

that's true you're not that far away so

you're having Pollan's having a

whispered conversation under the table

they're having a whispered conversation

by the table and I guess paltin and evil

and are kind of back to back a chick

says I turn on like

I'm right here also this is probably a

trap did you know there's nothing here

yeah I know you've told me that there's

nothing between us I get it you don't

have to wrap it in any way sister nor I

asked our sister narai street comes over

to you and Kaz grid is with her and she

says do you know those strange people

okay you seem to know those strange

people I do have a thing for this so not

muted so what I was going to say is I

was I'm like I rolled a perception to

see if I heard any of this whispered

conversation going on because as far as

I knew I was right next to the table for

most of that right they ever said I left

the table that I remember strix how

you'd like looked under the table Strix

was like I this is what the plan is

and then I said noted and then I stepped

back and kind of stood there and then I

heard her kind of like Huff or something

like dammit and and everyone else came

over right I'm I just be inconspicuous

and drink my empty cup and kind of

listen to this go down I just

rolled a twenty four for perception to

hear some / whatever I can of this yeah

well say you heard all of it right so I

hear particularly loud do you think this

is a drap yeah I mean particularly loud

for you guys but I am I'm gonna head out

to I'm going to head to hystyried before

she kind of I'm gonna like get away from

this yeah thing going on you know I see

I see you know captain nut slinger come

over and start sit nice and I'm like yo

I think this is too many too many

protagonists in one area so I'm going to

get out of the way real quick right

mister it says that guy who have crawled

under the table looks like the musical

legend palton SEPA that's the one in the

one in the same I had you I have to get

out what we're not living without the

stone it's not here what do you mean

listen there's someone under the table

who just who was who was searching for

the stone she told me so herself

I heard her huff and puff after she cast

yes

spell i ed you

I heard her huff and puff after casting

the spell she didn't get she said she

said that it wasn't there they were and

they were talking amongst themselves and

said it could be a trap if there isn't

any if there aren't any exits I think

why should I trust her

turns to the table and you see you're

talking like no news staff we've made a

deal with the dwarfs to get the stone

I can't renege on that now do we need to

get it now tonight there's just too

convenient of a situation if it ends up

in someone's else's hands we won't know

who they are and we won't be able to get

it then we can watch but I need we need

to stay close to the exits

is there any way for us to track it once

it's gone

I don't know if it's already hidden from

from from any kind of scrying or

detection that's one thing but if

they've gathered all of us in here for

know for if they've gathered all of us

in here on a boondoggle we could be in

for some serious trouble

watch the exits watch the doors and

watch everyone who works here these form

they seem to know a little bit more than

they're letting on I reckon there's

something familiar about them I can't

quite put my finger on it don't worry

I'll handle that is Diaw still walkin

around or is he under the table like

kids at Thanksgiving par there are more

people in costumes how to entered the

room now so if DF is among them you

don't know which one he is oh he's still

in the thing okay cool in niche

dammit cheering at this point in time

all of you the the Sun elf as interim

bard dabble comes out of the restroom it

looks like something is not sitting well

with his stomach he seems a little out

of sorts like he ate something off the

table that he shouldn't have or maybe

it's his very delicate elven

Constitution you can't tell but he comes

over to estrin and says can we expedite

this auction get this

I'm not feeling well they're going to

try and steal the stone well I guess

then we'll just have to kill them and

take it not exactly where my mind jumped

to first but um the dwarves are paying

us a lot of money let's not around

we're in a crowded room you imbecile we

can't start that kind of if we're okay

we can't handle that kind of attention

did he just call me did she just call me

an imbecile he says to istrict mr. it

says everyone calm down

we're not going to murder anybody unless

we have to this is a business

transaction

and she sort of grabs the talisman

around her neck which is the symbol of

Joaquin her God and she just starts

uttering a prayer to Joaquin the god of

trade to get this on it is this point in

time when and far comes into the room

and taps a glass with a spoon and says

ladies and gentlemen the auction is

ready to get underway

if I could have you join us in the

adjacent chamber I'm going to look it at

Esther II didn't give her like a see

what I mean kind of a look and before

you ahead in make sure you go to the

greeting room to pick up a number sign

if you intend to be bidding on the

Neriah is going to look among Istra did

Da'Ville and Yara and see if there is

any kind of a number sign between all of

us devil tells Yara to go get a sign for

the group and he says 12 if you can

swing it Oh probably but so they will

head off Yara and devil and Astrid will

head off to the auction room and leave

you sister Neriah to fetch the twelve

sign very well returning to the

returning to the table as briskly as I

can watching over the shoulder for Yara

and Dhaval and

yes 'tried he probably ate something

with milk in it or something like that

it seems um yeah it's it's the cheese

puffs I'm gonna go to the table with the

little number placards and look for

number Tweel's you see 11 and 13 just a

big sigh up in the distance here just ah

my hand will the hand will go towards 13

think better of it and get 11 instead

okay yes and the castle enters will

check choose the number 9 and the a

drunken captain's Ord will choose the

number 8 we all still like kind of under

this table yes it can kind of had kind

of wandered over to the table where

you're all hanging out underneath it

just like you wouldn't as on Jarl Axel's

arm now a bit you know there's gizmos

like pretty much everyone's there so at

least like color goes in that direction

to kind of reconvene before we get our

numbers and go to the auction area

mm-hmm

very good and before I forget

captain Azure will introduce you evylyn

to his company for the evening to lovely

and talented women who perform in the

sea maidens fair even as lots of

questions about that yes and one of them

is introduced to you as Margo of Arita

she is a musician and an acrobat and the

other one has introduced you as Kathy

Tamar's Suri Kavita Merson I'm sorry

Margot is the is a Lehrer stand Kavita

is the Acrobat Margo is the Lehrer stand

Kavita is the activist yes and he says I

would introduce you of course but I

don't want to betray your secret

identity

I'm very mysterious Oh Mike pokes his

head from the tables like

evylyn can you come here we have to talk

about something evylyn is like very miss

you blame evil in like yes you've

reciprocated

okay can you come here please Strix and

Paul torment you see you see feet walk

past you heading toward the auction room

and pretty soon you're just kind of

alone under the table and most of the

other people are clearing out of the

room okay well we have to follow them I

don't think we should go in there don't

if this is a setup please who would be

setting it up I don't know so you know

you know we're factory you know for a

fact that this auction was was set up by

lady of Rajan our lady Rajan our that's

the that's wait who's lady ROG Meyer

forgot me to time that's right it's a

trap it was set up by the black Viper

it's a trap that one you wouldn't just

come here please

evylyn Jarrell Axl's trying to pull you

in the other direction I will be safe

doing what we came here to do you it did

if you go in there it will not be good

here's that here you gotta listen you

gotta listen um it would be very awkward

for me to just go stand next to a table

while everyone else is walking in party

etiquette by now her voice is so far

away like 15 20 feet away that you're

not sure she's coming back

I like dimension door right in front of

her sure just like are you soon

like come with me besides she's like

there was a plan now there's no plan now

we just have to do something instead of

standing by a table and doing nothing

otherwise we're gonna get killed

we're leaving I assure you you are quite

safe with me oh my god just just show

because it like excuse me so that you

don't have to listen to this whole

conversation just like this is it's like

if we if we go in there then they'll try

to kill us if we stay here and look

weird they're gonna try to kill us

we should go don't we want to go to the

auction the auction is we have to do the

auction why

if we leave what will happen then

there's no stuff how do you know that

because I looked around I see me it all

up here maybe they have a dimensioned or

something we don't know that I just I

together we'll be fine and if anything

else Strix can just pop us back to the

house this is true if something bad

happens we can just go back to the house

people wonder why I'm the most

disconnected character fine let's go

with your little boyfriend here

assistant awry when you get to the

circle around back through at the sign

and get into the auction room you can

see that Da'Ville and Yara are sitting

side by side mister it is sitting next

to Kaz grid and there is a seat between

left between Babel and district 4 you

sort of the the middle member of that

five-member jared dr though you were not

sorting with the other ones right you

kind of avoided their little table party

i don't know how much i was able to

avoid Strix was looking back every two

seconds being like i think it's a trap

yeah basically what i have been able to

Chris and or Jared in or others would

you think I would be able to figure out

who DF is because yeah rise of the mind

that DF is the only like a fairly

competent member if he didn't look like

another half-dozen people dressed

similarly he'd be much easier to

identify yeah if nothing else I say

because I kind of lagged behind was

everyone else very quickly went to the

other room Kyle guys kind of like behind

 the other three yeah except

did that three of you are there so you

know permit you know for bidding illness

or something like that I can assume the

deaaath is in the room brought through

process of elimination just looking at

how these Matt how these mast and road

figures behave

you can probably conclude which one is

deaath because he's the one who wants to

not wants to keep the party in view

nothing none of the other masked people

give two shits about what's happening

under the table but three this one

masked figure seems concerned so so the

crosshairs come in on him and I'm like

 so I go so narai advances

silently as always on and and firmly

grasps his shoulder with a with a gloved

hand and says Woodrow just leering

daggers at him a stall worked no

response

um looking at looking continuing to look

at him just saying what are you and your

catalog of insipid cretins doing here

now exactly what I'm always doing making

sure we do the right thing we talked

about this last time now who are you

working with and how sure are you to

stone us here in the first place I'm not

working with anyone just let me just

check my memory real fast it's a lot of

memory also just the side know like I

don't immediately go in after everyone

goes in like I did plan to like come

back and wrangle via at some point where

they can be after this yeah I'm still

planning on doing our plan that we

talked about which is when the stone

comes out probably gonna misty step next

to it and then pick it up

and then quick and spell exit that's my

plan also alter solve beforehand to look

like mansion alright

okay I'll pull my mask off like

dramatically and be like boo and then

I'm gone what I know who mansion would

narai know who man soon as having seen

considering Strix literally said that

name directly to her yes you know that

mansion is the mastermind of a fragment

of the sent arm that is not associated

with your Zant RM group those two there

was a schism in the organization mansion

is considered to be too extreme to evil

to corrupt and to locked into the ways

of the past to really be part of the the

group these days and so your group has

been actively trying to subvert and or

destroy his organization okay yeah great

the the the the Jefferson Davis of

Waterdeep dare I say yeah great I will I

so and I'll say and I'll look at the

often say of all the people here you

could impersonate do you think that

mansion is the best choice I'm not

personating anyone thank you are you in

on your own plan that says amateurs I'm

going to say watch your back but I think

that we aren't necessarily enemies here

not yet

yes I'll just kind of give like a mask

nod yeah I'm going to menorah is going

to turn on her heel and and head back to

history and and her seat where she where

you will say they're going to be in the

disguise of Manchu all four of them are

here paltin and his ilk milk I mean I

assume one of them is your bassist or

something like and Istra sort of shoots

glance past you - gavel and says do you

have counterspell prepared and he says

no and she says hmm well I guess we may

have to be pre-emptive I'm looking I'll

look at I'll look at history with Nara

looks a district with wide eyes and says

Plan B then time B how did I know it

would come to this and nodding at

nodding a signal at a gavel and Yara

she's going to hand the 11 placard -

mister - mister ed yes thank you and and

and kind of awkwardly as always ed your

way out of the red your way out of the

road and and get to the edge of the room

I'm gonna kind of scope things out see

where the employee entrance to the stage

is see if there are any uniforms that

people are wearing see if there are any

exits here not just on this level but

out and above there are two exits from

the room one leading to the where the

food is on display the other leading

toward the greeting chamber okay so so

the stage and the stage is right between

them and there isn't there are no doors

leading off the stage it just appears to

quietly say it's a corner stage with no

doors leading off okay okay and the

walls are stone the walls are stone the

doors are the doors are wood but

or stun okay all right and and

everything is sort of magically lit with

continual light spells excellent all

right good at this point in time almost

everybody is settled unless you tell me

otherwise

I wanted to talk to DF okay go in there

I like walk back out and like like they

come like it's there's nothing party

there's nothing like you know it's it's

just a like very stoic Stern walk you

just walks up and goes yo I don't

exactly remember why we need this stone

or why we're doing it cuz you know I

don't listen half the time but whatever

the TLDR is once we do this thing we're

gonna do that other thing we talked

about okay remember there was stuff we

were gonna look for yeah of course I

haven't forgotten good great so if we

get out of this alive once we do this

thing we do that thing of course yeah

it's like I'm not not forgetting that

can you assign great now you just like

walks away doesn't let them finish all

right question really quick yep

could I animate a bunch of pastries in

the shape of a person only on DCA you

wouldn't you probably don't have a

person's amount of pastries on your

person no I mean around me like out in

the there's all those pastries or you

can do since there are discrete objects

I mean you can animate as many as the

spell allows so okay with a if it's a

tiny object you can animate let's see

the spell tells you you can do choose up

to 10 non magical objects within range

okay and pastry golem so there you go so

if I twin

I can get 20 yeah so maybe you can't win

us assume you can't win that spell sure

all I'm saying is that if I can animate

a bunch of pastries and put mansions

robe over it I will just now you'll

probably have to go back out into where

the pastries are to do that right to

physically put the robe on your mountain

of pastries

right um all right and then of course

you will you'll have to take your robe

off to get the room I can do it like

that you know like when you're when

you're like changing into a bathing suit

and how like a big towel on top of it

you just kind of like pull it to the

side and just like so it's underneath

the other sure but there's the Harlequin

mask you have to take off in the Hat oh

yeah that's right okay never mind I

won't do that it's fine I'll just die

well I guess that's I guess that's a

fine buy another option so at this point

in time and devar takes the stage D are

you staying outside no I'll have grabbed

my own number and gob 19 a nice going

and go into the auction area okay you

can see people seen all now seated in

their groups with all their numbered

placards at the ready to hold up to

start bidding and vara says ladies and

gentlemen and he holds out what looks

like a bag and he pulls out of the bag

this that's it oh it is here

and says the stone of galore a sentient

artifact that can communicate

telepathically with any intelligent

creature that attunes to it within this

stone is a vast archive of knowledge and

secret law not found in the greatest

libraries of faerun a glossy one pound

stone with three eyes and the ability to

perceive its surroundings the stone

harbors the intellect of an ancient and

powerful creature called an Abbe Aleph

named galore complete with a domineering

personality and a desire to exert its

formidable will upon any who

tuned to it the bidding will start at

ten thousand gold pieces you see

somebody in the back holds up a number

sign and then it goes up to 15

another sign goes up 20 another sign

goes up 25 another one 30 35 40 clutches

Charl axles arms she's like where's my

sign he will hold up a sign on your

command

evylyn and raise the bid to 50,000 then

you see Lord Castle enter hold his sign

up for 55 Astrid 60 Joel axel leans in

and says do what it's pretty badly don't

we yes we do I did promise to give half

of the money to the orphanage of your

choice he holds up his sign and more

scientists going at this point Strix is

gonna alter herself on her rope so look

like man shoot why do i Chi is there a

way for me to catch D off on the way in

yep okay

I'm going to stop him and say and say

trust me when I say you don't trust me

when I say you don't want this stone or

at least not bad enough to implicate

yourself at the level you're about to as

this is happening

lady castle enter gets up out of her

seat and leaves her husband there with

the manservant and makes her way toward

the exit toward you sister Narayan

toward you deaath what kinds of people

do you think you're dealing with in this

room I know exactly the kind of people

I'm dealing with is in this room and as

the bidding gets up to 80,000 gold a

lady castle enter has left to the room

do I take notice leave it up yeah

nope that's bad

I'm going to look at dfn gender I will

look at the often say let's see what I

mean oh no person who the person who

pays the most isn't the one who's going

to lead with the stone it's the last one

standing

no I understand that I know exactly who

that is this is wrong

all this is wrong yes do you think that

bringing mansion into it will help

things you'd be funny though you're not

here you are now underneath your robes

you are now mansion waiting for your

moment

Oh off and she starts she starts she

leans over to dry locks when she's like

whatever happens next

he holds it he holds up the sign and the

bidding hits 100,000 gold and there are

hushes about the room you see a number

of other bidders to sort of put their

signs in their lap realizing they are

way out of their league and that's when

that's one thing that's when mr. it

holds up the sign and it becomes 125 oh

my god she's doing that is going to cast

foul matter G to cause all the lights to

go off and all of the doors and windows

to close there are no windows okay but

there are there are two doors that will

basically close the doors after lady

castle enter has left of the room okay

the other door is already shut so the

lights start to blink out I'd like

everybody to roll initiative 426 or how

I played understand dragons that's fine

that's all cool Holly what did you offer

Strix I got a 9 jared 8 8 anna 14 14 and

nathan 26 26 alright well what's least

one of us

so the lights start blinking rapidly

paltin what do you do the lights go on

you just kind of looks around like yeah

I'm just keep sitting okay nothing no

one's actually like fighting or anything

yep of course this whole time I like to

imagine Palme was actually saying just

like standing up against the back wall

yeah frustration sister narai what do

you do when the magical lights in the

room start to flicker okay so I will

immediately use two key to cast dark

vision so that's handled and then I'm

are their guards or their staff or is it

just an VAR it's just an var and the

stone on the stage and then all of the

bidders there are so many reasons I

don't like any of this alright so narai

is going to mariah is going to move up

toward the side is going to okay so cast

cast dark vision so that's the action

and then move up toward the side of the

state toward the side of the room toward

the stage so if it's like if we're here

right and I assume the exits are like

down here down here it's gonna kind of

move up towards not onto the stage but

just like kind of near the stairs

assuming somebody's gonna try and ride

jump on that and are you trying to

be you're trying to be stealthy stuck in

the shadows kind of thing uh if I can

assuming that literally everything is

shadow yeah well things are getting kind

of dark with the lights blinking out

wanna make Estelle's roll sure that'd be

great no biggest oh all right

here oh yeah remember that remember that

die you gave me I just got a D&D symbol

nice cool all right so that's plus eight

so I'm I'm I'm invisibo you blend all

right yes so you disappear into the

shadows very very close to the stage

within almost an arm's reach

you'd say of Anvar you know a bit of a

leap and an arm's reach doable is he

within range and do I have room to say

something quick you should do and vark

take the stone and get out he says to

you actually just sort of turns for the

shadow surprise that your voice is there

it just kind of looks into the shadows

to try to see this blurry shape somehow

hidden that his sister and awry and says

I'm just lady Ross lady as release proxy

I don't want this thing then let me

handle it that's that's against the

rules so it's turning off all the lights

and do you think we're going by the

rules anymore and I think that's gonna

like conclude my turn okay sure

next up is Jarl axel he sees the

blinking lights and he says

I can do one better and he will cast a

spell that envelops the entire chamber

in utter darkness

damn it all right so it's absolutely

black in the room there is nothing

anybody can see in the room whatsoever

and evylyn you feel relaxed he'll slip

free of your grasp next up is and far

who stops talking and is in the darkness

he is going to thrust the stone at you

sister narai you feel it pressed against

you

perfect and as you do immediately as

soon as you take it you realize that

it's kind of alive that in the darkness

it is now speaking to you and it says a

tomb to me so that I assume would be a

ruse save some kind nope you just think

it really wants you to attune to it but

there's no saving through attunement

isn't something that happens

instantaneously it requires several

minutes would it take it would it take a

an action to wrap it in my cloak and

just say in a minute well you have it

but okay I read yeah you so and nobody

can see you because it's pitch black and

everyone here attuned to me or is it

just narai I'm sorry can everyone hear

is it like a baseball announcer no not

at all it seems to be it seems to be a

telepathic command great super alright

and that's that's all that and var does

on his turn next up let's see you don't

know what they're doing because it's

pitch black don't know what she's doing

because it's pitch black and then it is

sister and don't know what he's doing

because it's pitch black oh he can't

target him because it's pitch black

there is a lot of panic in the room as

people start to get up from their chairs

and flail their way blindly toward exits

and then

evylyn I would like you to make a

dexterity saving throat because you're

getting knocked and and pushed around by

this crowd making a beeline out of the

room or team okay you find yourself kind

of thrown down on the floor and almost

trampled by some folks now you don't

take any damage it's more annoying than

X but there's a lot of pushing and

shoving and you are sort of one of the

people who got knocked down so you hit

the ground the the women beside you also

got bowled over or at least one of them

did and it is your turn evylyn you can't

see anything I can't see anything but I

can

since good and evil you sure can

I am going to use divine sense to sense

what's evil in the room okay you are

picking up a powerful force of evil so

powerful you think it might be a demon

or a devil whoops

and it is coming from the stage or there

abouts okay there is also other evil in

the room but nothing of that magnitude

and then she just closes her eyes and

senses the location of that evil and

just winds up and goes straight for it

okay I'm going to need you to make a

attack role but a disadvantage because

you can't see okay and even when you

sort of light up your weapon you can't

see its light okay nineteen and did

what's your other role did you role

digital twice okay then you hit this

creature whatever it is how does it feel

when I hit it not not good it is squishy

smell anything it smells a brimstone

does it cry out at all it hisses royal

damage nice and she's using two hands so

that's gonna be

okay it's deep ten plus four is the face

so twelve I'm assuming this is gonna get

the radiant damage is this it will take

the radiant damage yep okay so twelve

six and five okay smite okay which is

going to give her in fact she'll do that

I mean it she felt that being real evil

so she's gonna do it at third level so

that's gonna be what did I just say the

total is eighteen eighteen okay 21:37

and plus an extra one because it's a

fiend right correct

plus five what did I just say man my

memory survived a thirty thirty one

thirty one plus seven so no plus five so

36 okay great

do you have a second attack yes oh my

god laughs amber even in darkness she

shall be smited is this a disadvantage

again yes

no man hey eighteen though okay that's

gonna hit okay next person by the way is

gonna be DF well I add up my damage yeah

let's see

14 plus 32 plus

56 great did you say 56 56 all right

first level well got it okay so it

hisses oh I didn't I didn't account for

improved divine smite that gives me one

more add for thank you got it and then

right before DF acts there is some blood

that splashes on you sister narai you

think it must have come from Anvar was

warm and wet but he he just got skewered

or by something or other and then as you

are momentarily distracted by that death

what do you do so I was well at last

people to enter in yes and when I was in

there did I see any other exits or

anything from this room there was one

other exit besides the one you're

standing in front of and that's on the

other side of the stage game is alright

but for the most part most people

entered in through this side absolutely

all of them a and lady castle enter she

went out the one behind you no yeah okay

so basically knowing she went that way

and knowing just based on familiar area

I would assume most people would panic

and try to run back this way as well

mm-hm

I am going to kind of like slink my way

out of that room yeah in that hallway

near that entrance waiting for people to

come out once you step out of the room

you are no longer in the darkness great

yeah so I'm step out that way and

basically watching that doorway for

anyone to come out and if I happen to

see anyone holding the stone of galore

I'm just going to like bump into them

okay

sister and awry a creature attempts to

grab you is it still dark it is still

pitch-black so you can't eat it it has

advantage on its attack role and it

rolled in that 20 so it grabs you and

when it does it's like its whole body is

covered with barbets spines and it just

tries to impale you on its body as it

hugs

you rude you could also feel spines on

its arms and long long hands that coil

around you so it does a total of 16

points of damage and you are grappled by

it okay great

and it says something to an infernal but

you probably don't know what that is

and then a something something akin to a

fireball goes off in the room everybody

must make dexterity saving throws that

wasn't me everybody except di yep anyone

who's close to me can get my aura I

don't know if anyone is +5 I'm not I

roll the dexterity saving its Road just

for fun anyway because I'm really good

at it what's the range of the aura what

do you mean I think that one is ten let

me show ya

am i within 10 feet no okay then it's a

dirty 20 okay all right this is a yeah

this is a dexterity save and the saving

DC is 15 18 we good okay

if you saved successfully you take 24

points of damage know if you failed you

take 48 and the save was what sorry 15

and if your teeth lling you take half of

that right well actually you take a less

you take not quite half because some of

it is actually radiant damage never mind

so I take if you're a teeth Li yes you

do if you're a tea fling you would take

sorry did you save Holly I did yes so

you would take 36 I said no that's not

sorry nope 12 okay yep and after that

goes off another spell goes off can I

counter spell this I don't know what's

happening no you can't see it god damn

it

I'm in the darkness going it's real man

soon another explosion goes off I'd like

everybody again to make dexterity saving

throws if you're in the room the safe DC

is 14 oh no I didn't make it this time

86 wait aren't I lucky now what are you

halfling 19 okay Strix around 18 okay so

it sounds like all of you made it so you

need it not okay

you take 36 points of damage evylyn and

everybody else takes 18 except Strix who

takes 9 so 18 for paulten 18 for sister

nor I 9 fish sticks I don't know if it's

real mansion anymore alright

and then another spell goes off no no

it's him well just standing in the back

as is all happening you just yep alright

that that that that's not gonna do it

yeah and suddenly there's a lot of sound

like people kind of hitting the floor

just toppling over but none of you are

affected but a lot of the screams of

panic have stopped like that as people

just suddenly collapse but D F that's

when people start to pour out of the

room

throw in some cases throwing off their

garb to reveal their true faces in a

panic looking for an exit as they run

past you but none of them look familiar

a few of them still have their garb on

but it's their disks have come off and

all that kind of business and then one

of the women one of the young women who

was in the company of that gregarious

c-captain comes out she's got a boa

around her neck not a snake but a

feather boa and and she also looks a

for the exit as well but doesn't go too

far she sort of turns back to the

darkness to see if anybody else she

knows emerges Chris I have resistance to

damage from spells okay so you would

take half damage from each of those okay

so also real quick

Neriah has evasion yep well that's

important is that yes premised if you

have evasion you would take no damage

from any of them precisely cool okay

thank you alright

in that case I just took the sixteen

damage from the gnarly bear hug correct

Strix what do you do well I'm gonna

dispel this darkness well first I'm not

gonna be ma'am soon anymore because I

think real man shane's found me out

okay when you dispel the darkness you

see all the chaos around you yeah

Victoire Oh Castle enter is there you

see that the tip of his cane is glowing

red the ruby tip I immediately look at

him and I go oh my god he's gonna steal

the stone and then the teeth fling with

him turns to you and gives you an angry

look you see that sister Neriah is in

the grasp of a bar bed devil oh that's

yours I thought it was barbed if it's

bar bed I like that a lot yeah and so

this devil has him impaled and in his

clutches and Vaughn is lying dead or

unconscious on the stage with Jarl axel

standing over him Jarl Axel's rapier

bloodied and you can see no sign oh and

of the santarem members you can see that

as soon as the darkness drops the the

Sun elf begins to cast a spell and it's

your well I thought you saw movement

left after you dispel it and they're

like oh and there are a bunch of people

sleeping on the floor I think I smell

all right well my concern is that devil

and I look at the devil guy know that I

make eyes with the cantle and first

light neener neener

so I make like meaner eyes at them like

and I look at the barbed devil and I

yell at it in infernal and I say why

would you be slaves to these masters

when you could serve under one who's

stronger than them and I intimidate him

to let go right yeah does the devil look

at all yeah sure absolutely

yeah I intimidate him can I use the

bonus action not only on your turn okay

you can use a reaction off turn oh yeah

yeah okay so make an intimidation check

against the Barbet devil it's twenty

four big yikes now normally this devil

is completely under the thrall of the

individual who summoned it in this case

Lord Castle enter

however strix you sense the intervention

of a powerful evil force that lends such

weight to your words that the voice

coming out of your mouth is completely

unrecognizable to you and is speaking in

a language you have never spoken before

in your life something akin to a dark

speech as you speak to this devil cracks

in the walls of appear and the devil

almost looks like it's going it starts

to be bleed black pus out from pores in

its skin as it releases and as soon as

it does it sort of size with relief that

it wasn't split in half and just as

 up as I am when when Victoria

sees that you see the his little light

on the end of this cane just kind of go

out and I did I guess I just look at the

mo - a get out and cistern RI you are no

longer being held and that's Strix is

action which brings us back to the top

which also is that paltin

you don't know what came out of Strix

his mouth but if you never hear those

words again it'll be too soon I was just

trying to be spooky not that spooky and

you could see that her shadow behind her

on the wall has this dreadful fiendish

countenance that just sort of subsides

back into her normal form when she's

done seen shadow cracks in the wall

black blood pus bonus gotta like hoist

himself off the wall

then just like walks out the door steps

over steps daintily over all the

unconscious people on the floor then

makes his way outside dafuc paulten

emerge all right what the hell is that

like put a hand on your shoulders like

we're all rooting for you buddy

yeah and just keeps as you keep walking

there is a servant standing there with a

play you can just sort of grab a wine

cup off of the plate as you go sister

and awry okay okay okay okay I have a

thing you have the stone yes very much

so

so I I need to kind of diagram this for

a second

so Paul turns has lot of alight

happening no no I got you

okay there's a lot of light happening

here so I I wanted to hand it will check

something sure no no here's the light

right here's the corner stage wrap yeah

the demon I moved up to sign aha yeah it

was like you know give me the thing

uh-huh even grabs me facing the wall

yeah and then the flight that's being

cast from behind him yeah right yeah

shadows mm-hmm you see over there okay

you got shadows and I just got dropped

yes and I'm just gonna what shadow step

okay and trying to peer in the midst of

the crowd or in the doorway or just

anywhere away from the stage that isn't

lit do you have to appear in a location

you can see

can I see any other yeah you can you can

see like locations I'm just curious know

how what it actually says it says so it

says when you were in dim light darkness

blah blah blah blah you can teleport up

to 60 feet okay to an unoccupied space

you can see great it is also in dim

light or dark s so you can which is

there is there are some shadows cast by

the open doors you could basically get

out of the room into the doorway of the

other room if I can mix with the

screaming escaping crowd yeah all races

make a stealth check against deaths

perception check sweet can do good luck

on this one buddy my stealth check is a

is a 21 oh my perception is a 24 do you

see sister in her eye and she has the

stone of goal or in her clutches great

so as she's like coming out with the

rest of the crowd trying to like get

away I was like a lump under my cape

I wouldn't feel like it'd be like got it

weird right yes look at NASCAR trophy I

guess a very high perception idea I

think I actually get in the way rooms

like lupus and like kind of like forced

her to college bump into me with such

force that we both go tumbling kind of

over and during that is when I make my

attempt to sleight of hand the stone off

of her I'm gonna make a dex check to not

I'm gonna say that that's fair you can

each make if you if you both have

sleight of hand you can make contested

sleight of hand checks I don't I just

have Dex okay or would that be strength

maybe you can choose strength if you

want I'm gonna choose Dex okay

[Applause]

pretty good I got a 24 24 26 chance

mice all right I've 15 okay so you you

Swingle it away from him

in the tumble that you orchestrate you

swindle the stone away from him sis

Turner I should say sister and awry you

realize right away that he's he's

slipped the stone

out of your possession I'm going to look

at him and all you've done at this point

is that it was that an action to move to

shadow step that was an it was a bonus

action so you saw if you're a shadow

step is a bonus action and I get

advantage in the first melee attack I

make before the end of the turn great

what do you want to do I am going to try

and use a non-lethal attack Oh what do

we have here hang on hang on I'm looking

for something specific

yeah this isn't all it's that war right

here we're gonna wrap up soon just so

everybody knows hey alright great so I

rolled a high roll 17 plus my attack

bonus which is a plus 825 to hit DF okay

yeah that's gonna hit stunning strike

okay and he has to make a saving throw

correct yes Constitution saving daddy's

gonna take damage right yes that is

accurate so I'm gonna roll damage and

throw with damage uncanny dodge so yes

you could reduce the damage by half

definitely in that case then you just

take you it would be round up or down

because it's down a dip down

so three okay so basically I'm just

gonna pop up I'm gonna sock you in the

jaw right yeah I know Constitution save

me through 14 um my what is my thing I

have it right here
