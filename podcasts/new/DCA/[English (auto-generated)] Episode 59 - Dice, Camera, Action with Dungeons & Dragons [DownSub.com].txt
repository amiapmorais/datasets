[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action hey everyone this is the plus one

and Danny's character thanks Danny for

joining us today

[Music]

soonish

but let's just get right underway strix

you you are at the reins of a vast ani

wagon that is cutting a path through

snow that grows ever deeper as the night

wears on

you're basically trundling through

wilderness through forests trees and

foothills alone for the most part on the

top of this wagon with your friends

inside and I think actually evylyn are

you on the wagon as well yeah okay I'm

sitting up there with Strix I'm yeah she

was kind of like evil ins had this look

on her face like she doesn't remember

how to be polite and she's just kind of

staring at Strix and like sometimes

getting too close to her face something

and she just has this look of like

complete passive like she does she

doesn't even realize anyone else can see

her kind of thing

okay well it's snowing pretty heavily

now and you can see the snow is kind of

weighing down on the brim of Strix is

hat as she's just snapping the reins on

the horse pulling the wagon the snow is

now kind of up to the horse's stomach

and the horse is slowing down a bit as

the snow becomes more of a burden

through the night as you look behind you

occasionally you see there is a skeletal

horse following in the wagons wake and

the rider on the horse is sir Godfrey he

is a knight of the order of the silver

dragon who decided to follow you out of

burrow via and the only thing he has

said since you left that horrid land is

looking around at the night sky and the

snow falling in the mountains and things

he says my god

it's beautiful and that's the whole

thing he said that's nice

and you can see he sort of got these dim

pinpoints of red light in his eyes and

he becomes as more of a dark shadow

following you as the night wears on

there's no moon as completely cloud

covered and the snow is falling pretty

heavily inside the wagon DF and paltin

are they're also following the wagon is

waffles of course who is now very large

she's got lots of padding and fur to

protect her from the cold and but inside

the wagon DF paltin and Simon one thing

you notice evylyn as you're riding up

next districts is that you don't feel

the cold at all you are this does not

this cold weather doesn't seem to affect

you but it does start to affect strix

she's her hands you know she has to sort

of flex her hands occasionally as she's

got the reins and she starts to shiver

in the cold and some of the snow from

her brimmed hat sort of falls down under

her robes down her back at one point and

she you know takes off her hat and beats

it and puts it back on and does all the

things a cold person does to try to stay

warm given these conditions

yeah as Strix is it's uh-oh am echoing

hold on why am i echoing I heard an echo

okay it stopped a long fix is sitting

there she's um she's just like you know

trying to get the snow off of her but

she's not really looking at an evil and

she's just kind of looking forward and

and you're not following you're not

following a road at all so it's actually

kind of important that you are looking

for in case yeah and as it starts

getting more and more cold she's just

gonna start humming to herself because

she's like it's teiecast a new coping

mechanism for her so he's just gonna

start looking into swingley

[Music]

Nealon here's this and she's kind of

like she starts seeing me love me and so

for me I choose to stay for on scene

today life is weighty each night

[Music]

promises and even just looks shocked and

she's like that's that's one of my

favorite songs where where did you learn

that

oh I don't know I just heard it

somewhere outside of the village I mean

you hear lots of things like you know

that's fine that's from one of the kids

but I never let him on my in my hut cuz

they're gross but father-son bright use

just I remember he used to sing that in

in the temple and and I imagine that

even kind of like some color starts to

come back around her and she's like I

father's Sun bright was his name

actually father-son fight was this light

emic light face that was his name

having strict his face and hugging her

she's like this is real pretty simple

and her just named like Vladimir evil

path like well this is going on she's

like clapping and looking around and

like feeling the snow and she I imagine

that she's like there's starts to be a

little bit of a glow around her as she

kind of starts to like be in communion

with Lysander for the first time again

in the middle of the night yeah

absolutely and well when the song

started

d/f palton you could hear it from inside

the wagon but at first you're like and

then you hear it's kind of descend into

kind of like shouting why do you make

light face really loud how do you how do

palton and deaath react if at all inside

the wagon DF is always like this whole

time is it from kind of leaning forward

just kind of almost staring down at his

feet and then after the actual him

begins and he listens to it yeah like he

leans back and tilts his head back up

against the back of the wagon closes the

eyes and just very intently listens to

it takes it in same Simon is just kind

of like he doesn't do anything at first

cuz he's not sure where it's coming from

he thinks it might be coming from like

what Strix might call like dark heaven

or something he's not really sure like

he's never heard that before and then he

just kind of just sort of absently

starts the kind of rock uh even as soon

as soon as she started like squealing

and talking about how it's real yet

she's alive and all her friends are

alive she I want to like have her crawl

to the top of the wagon and like open

the door and like hang down you know

as paulson and do yes and be like did

you know this is real

we're actually alive preys lebanner and

then she leaves again clomp xerxis is

still trying to keep warm she's all

business after the song almost like it

didn't happen

alright I'd like DF and paltin to make

perception checks 43 I have been

drinking now there are two nice sized

casks of Peruvian wine that were left in

this wagon for you paltin but I was all

upon that by Bustani so and the other

thing I'll mention to you briefly

paulten is that you could actually sense

at some point during this road trip that

you're now on the you could sense the

instant when you left borough via and

entered a new world it just felt like

some weight fell off your shoulders mmm

it was momentary and it passed but but

since then you have felt just a burden

lifted but as the wagon kinda hits a rut

under the snow and lists to one side

some stuff that was sort of packed up

high comes falling down and rains down

on top of you paltin and you're sort of

oblivious to it until it hits you

literally on the head it doesn't do any

damage or anything but it stuff falls

around you and you're just like oh yeah

that's how yeah you see something

amid the crap that just fell that you

hadn't noticed before somebody has

tucked what appears to be a folded

leather piece of parchment with a wax

seal and it's now just sort of landed on

the floor of the wagon alright

diesel get up and like kind of start

picking the stuff up to put it back into

place and yeah ask Paul to make sure

he's okay didn't hurt too bad nothing's

bleeding I'm just under a pile of stuff

you just feel like

but a thumbs-up yes just like yeah same

start putting all the stuff back and

we'll find the parchment it has a wax

seals a seal that I recognize yes it is

the seal of strogg Vons air ovitch and

castle Ravenloft it is the vanzara vich

seal grate which looks like a raven with

wings outstretched on a cameo that looks

like a silhouette of the castle itself

oh okay

it's got the little raven symbol on

there yeah let's go look at that a piece

of parchment spike oh

palton I think this is for you know what

[Laughter]

yeah I think it's for you you you look

at the parchment in the wax seal with

blurry eyes mm-hmm like thanks so I I

recognize this you recognize the seal as

the seal of the Von's era which seal but

you until you open the letter you have

no idea who it's actually addressed to

or I'm like oh man this is sealed and I

don't know who it's actually addressed

to yeah I open it

alright you slice it open pull it open

and in written on the inside of the

parchment in fine penmanship not blood

nothing we're just fine fine penmanship

is the following letter and it's

actually I'm going to make a make a

constitution saving throw to see how

drunk you are

alright strong wine but he's accustomed

to this kind of thing so uh I guess not

drunk enough cuz 18 okay so your your

eyes are not blurred or not so blurry

that you can't read the script which

says saviours you are always in my

thoughts you were dead and now I'm told

you will live again

what powerful friends you have made

they have helped me get this letter to

you and I hope it finds you well enough

the darkness has claimed

strawed once more as it was always meant

to I suppose

the staff and Garrison were horrified by

his transformation as were we

most of them fled into the night father

Romulus stayed behind to watch over us

until Stroud could abide him no longer

it all seems so long ago Sergey and I

reside in the castle with our children

and grandchildren prisoners of the demon

but he will not harm us as long as we

stay the rest of burrow via is safe from

his hunger whenever he succumbs to rage

I remind him of the words he wrote in

blood and those words restore his sanity

we've become a comfort to him and we try

to love him it is the narcissists curse

that he cannot truly love any other but

himself

but there is no pain so great that

cannot be overcome with love

strawed Sergei and I have found a

peaceful coexistence morbid though it

may seem my only fear is what will

become of burrow via once we are gone

from this dark place

on the other hand I dare not

underestimate the will in the fortitude

of the Peruvian people we have always

been strong in our own way of strods

tome nothing remains but ashes raha Dean

casted into the fire because he feared

order weaken his master straud was

furious to learn of its destruction and

banished the dust elf from our lands

forever

I do not miss the Chamberlain's

glowering visit there's an old Bustani

saying we travel far until we find our

home mine is here with my family in

Ravenloft may whatever land you call

home greets your safe return with open

arms and a warm welcome embrace you fill

our hearts with joy and light yours

until the end of time

Tatiana as I mentioned of raha Dean's

banishment

dancer says come Sultan there's breath

yes here did we all hear it matter

well paltin hasn't shared it with any

well Alton did you read it out loud or

did you read it to yourself I read it

out loud

all right Strix and evil and make

perception checks to see if you can hear

the reading through the hull of the

bardo wagon I read it out very loud

advantage on 19 okay you did Strix for

sure thanks okay that's worth advantage

well oh no not with advantage okay

rolling oh okay well that's a net one I

don't think that's but not a spare

because even is literally I she was

crawling over the top of the carriage

and then she was like she's like petting

buffaloes God like this everything she's

like putting her face as close to it as

possible and just like touching things

and just basking in reality so everybody

heard the letter but evylyn right

what's tricks can't talk to anyone cuz

she's driving the carriage but she's

like definitely she's definitely like

she's definitely tearing up with the

fact that Tatiana was alive for sure or

it's just and the fact that they did

something good and it was it was worth

it that something good came out at all

of that what do you do with the letter

after you've read it palton I'm gonna

fold it up and put it in my pocket

morning comes and by then the blizzard

and the snow have brought so much of the

white stuff that's tricks the horse and

wagon just can't go on

[Music]

is there any way that I could I burn it

don't purr the wagon I can't no no I

mean you can try to like detonate a few

fireballs in your path some snow but the

overall effect is you it's not gonna

happen you can move a little bit further

but not really the miles that you with

my strength and resistance to cold could

I fashion some sort of plow from

branches and push it ahead of the wagon

you think that you would probably need

more sophisticated tools to do that all

right yeah and the horse you can see is

just not as decided it is not going

anywhere now oh and it's it probably

couldn't get very far even if it pushed

itself right yeah and I guess the snow

is is so heavy that when palton and yet

you sort of look through the windows you

it's it's as high as the wheels of the

waggon oh I will try and melt if I can

just the snow around so when again so

that we can just have like a little

clearing or a cam so if I even if it's

I'm just using like a torch you know

anything even sculpt your flames or

whatever - yeah just around yeah around

the wagon okay just so that we have like

a clearing with the wall of snow kind of

around us I'm probably done this a few

times in the 50 years that I was stuck

in burrow

yep now that it's all so light out in

the morning and the snow has abated

somewhat you can see your surroundings

in the distance you do see big

ice-covered mountains very very close by

but the land itself does not seem that

familiar to you and you would say that

you have not emerged in the same place

you emerged the last time you left

yeah damn it of course not like in a

snowy mountainous region but yes

familiars no car accident there are no

familiar landmarks even the shape of the

mountain seems different oh well we're

obviously gonna be here for a while

can't even flings open the door of the

carriage and she's like now that we're

all together is a pumpkin fold that was

actually like he's underground she just

looks over and like this she's like in

the great oven it's time for a campout

and the rest of the rest of you were

actually quite freezing cold evil and

not bothered in the slightest

waffles not really bothered in the

slightest and sir Godfrey on his horse

not troubled in the least since he's a

dead revenant guy and he doesn't get

down off his high skeletal horse he just

sits on the horse perfectly still

oblivious to the wind and cold and just

kind of looks around vigilantly to make

sure there's no imminent danger in the

area

evylyn you can seen in the light now for

the first time his breastplate has

basically sort of the partially scraped

off symbol of the Sun and he has certain

vestments over his armor that suggests

possibly he's a priest or even a paladin

of some kind and I don't know him other

than having met him he's a friend of

Strix is apparently you met him when you

were quote-unquote brought back from the

dead he was one of the ones there

present and responsible does he sleep it

does not appear so now all right you

know Strix is just gonna go around the

circle that she's made and just start

like dropping some salt yeah and just

like drawing symbols in the sand just

like really weird things that you

haven't seen her do before that you

don't know are gonna make a difference

it's just like scraping things kind of

muttering to herself it's like drawing

in the snow Alton's just like oh no it's

cold

[Laughter]

you're cold I feel fine

great if we have any kind of supplies

you do have you do have a generous

amount of rations and other gear stowed

away in the vardø and the vest on e

being ever prepared for stops and such

do pack things like firewood and tinder

boxes and things so yes you could light

a fire okay

EF will occupy himself with just

collecting up a small amount of firewood

at least get a stick somewhere were to

be that we can all make a survival check

to light the fire even starts like like

Pakistanis know around palton where he's

lying on the ground okay I heard that

you make a cave out of snow you stay

warm just turns out it just makes your

ass wet palton good night okay you can't

get this fire we'll see I'm

struggling and just go no I got it

and then she'll tell Simon to collect

some wood she'll just be like Simon will

go off and he just sort of disappears

into a snowdrift because he's actually

shorter than the snow piles even that

season go and she's like if this is

strix help

how old is Simon how how old is is who

Simon she's like still like grinding in

the ground just like like hitting it

harder

she's like hmm I only I guess 50

something she looks at Paul's and she's

like your son is 50 something whoa cray

I heard the the fires yeah legions Simon

goes off to get firewood dear Phil was

like look around a little bit just drop

his hands to the side and just sit next

to the fire okay about an hour later

Simon comes back and throws a pinecone

on the ground

I'll give a single Nadja's and he's

still a good boy he'll stand by the fire

with his hands out as though to warm

them like that makes any difference

whatsoever oh he thinks these people uh

is just gonna look at Diaz and just be

like you want to know how many times I

thought about for a minute there a lot

like what was that Jesus actually likes

perched himself at that booty burn Wow

and are we burnin just the fiery son of

Lysander well it does burn very bright

yes you've learned so much about what

the under why live in Ghana good morning

Lord shines upon you that's right and

she takes a flask from her side and it's

filled with the goat blood and just

drinks it Oh

question yeah is my hand still with me

it is sick yeah indeed this dead black

investigated hand just crawling around

wherever you want it to I like just

noticed I'm like oh yeah so yes you do

have your severed disembodied hand so

that's great time seems to pass sir

godfrey doesn't say anything waffles

just sort of plops down by the fire and

makes funny sounds

occasionally we'll kind of live this

kind of long fart and then go and then

go off and kind of bound off through the

snow and come back with some blood smear

on her beak whenever she gets hungry she

just sort of goes off and does her thing

and comes back and yeah that's it

we don't even know what it was she's

just right exactly yeah she doesn't

bring back her mess it's just gone with

a little bit of

smear that the Strix has to wipe off

with a chamois got a good tidy girl yeah

can I play fetch with her I pick up a

stick and I throw it she looks at it and

she looks at you and then just sort of

slowly marches off and gets it and

brings it back and drops it in the fire

she's like see it's smarter than Simon

will just turn his head around 180

degrees and look at you give you the

finger and then go back to warming his

hands yeah this is an old ritual that

they seem to have there and the whole

party has a big laugh yeah oh you guys

bonded yeah and as you guys are sort of

camped out there with sir Godfrey

looming over you somewhat awkwardly you

hear a noise the likes of which you

haven't heard before it's kind of like a

so waffles fart again it does not sound

like a waffles fart but waffles does

take notice and she sort of casts her

eyes up above the trees and that's when

you see a ship come over the treetops it

looks like almost like a small galleon

about 45 50 feet long with railings on

the top and a big sort of bowsprit under

which is carved what looks like a

draconic symbol it's wing this is sort

of bleeding back and forming up at the

hull of the ship and it has runners on

it like ski runners that protrude from

the bottom of the ship and just sort of

hanging below it and above the ship

affixed to it by a massive amount of

rigging is a gigantic hot-air balloon

have we ever seen anything like this

before

you have not evylyn laid eyes on a

flying craft the likes of this is this

something that I've never been aware of

in my time

um I knew about so I will have you make

just a make an intelligence check DF

okay yep intelligence yeah okay you have

heard that there are vehicles or you've

heard you've heard rumors of at least

one vehicle similar to this that used to

be sighted in the skies near Dagger

furred and closer toward water deep yeah

probably here at least rumours of it he

hasn't water deep yep you never actually

laid eyes on it but the the vessel is

familiar this could be that same vessel

you don't know exactly how many there

are

yeah but I still just like stand up and

stare at it and awe yes and as the ship

drifts over the camp Jean dalla you cast

your eyes down from the deck and so do

several members of your crew and you can

see what appears to be a wagon stuck

in the snow with a bunch of people

camped behind it you saw the smoke trail

from their fire over the treetops and

sort of redirected your vessel to this

point I think I turn to one of my crew

members and I say those losers they will

look down on the crew and waffle crew as

you gaze up you can see that the crew of

the ship is looking down on you you

can't make up too many details but many

of them are dressed in black and wearing

masks eeveelutions in front of waffles

like this like to protect her but she's

like way way smaller than waffles just

Jean dalla your first officer Nez Roth

says do you want to talk to them I mean

I guess we should and they probably need

help anyway but yeah let's say let's

check it out all right

he will just silently gesture to some of

the other crew members and the ship

begins to kind of circle around the camp

and is descending a lower than the tops

of the treetops it looks like it's

coming down but slowly gradually safely

constricts ask Godfrey if he has any

like maybe protection from evil or

something that he can protect us the

camp with so to pretty much just tell

him to protect everyone

he will utter a blessing of the morning

Lord upon the camp you're not sure

whether or not he actually cast a spell

because he didn't move his hands or

anything he just sort of spoke a prayer

and he says don't worry I'll protect you

good good enough but strix is gonna fly

up with your broom towards the ship and

tell everyone not to move so shangela

you and your crew you see this tiefling

hitch mounts up on a broomstick and

basically zoom up into the air toward

you alright Strix you can see that the

vessel has you've never seen anything

quite like this but it is equipped with

weapons there is a large harpoon gun

mounted to the bow and what appears to

be some sort of heavy crossbow mounted

to a rig on the aft so it has weapons

fore and aft all right she looks out and

sees people on the on the deck yes she's

just gonna show she has no weapons and

just say like thank Connor is like we

come in peace we don't know where we are

we just just got out of you know what I

don't even want to talk about it we're

just stuck okay you count seven people

on the deck of the ship one of them is

not dressed like the others she appears

to be a half elf with dirty blond hair

and freckles on her face or something

but she's where she wears this cloak pin

and a big sort of cloak that's flapping

in the winter wind her crew are made up

of six individuals dressed in black

leather with black leather armor and

capes with an unusual cut and designed

to them almost bird-like and masks

completely covering their faces with

horns coming off of the masks and they

seem to be busying themselves with

getting the ship down you can see

underneath the big balloon is what

appear is what appears to be a metal

cylindrical sculpted furnace with a huge

flame coming out of the top of it that

seems to provide lift the aft of the

ship has a propeller and that propeller

is what's making that noise

good to know I don't understand how it

works at all and the crew doesn't say

anything Danny they leave it to captains

and Alla to speak for herself well I

think this which looks pretty chill so I

think then dalla just says hey do you

guys need help

or what are you doing we just we just

left a foreign land and we were stuck

here in the snow my party's down there

my owl bears down there

my robot son is down there not my son no

mine he's just a burden to me but you're

welcome to come and help us because we

need to get out of here and also where

are we where is here do you know where

there is miss Roth says she's clearly

crazy

she's still talking to herself as he

says that like also I don't know I have

this weird itch in my head but you know

it's maybe it's because I met the snow

but it's fine

I lean to Nazareth and I say yeah well

let's help them uh alright yeah do you

want to come aboard or shall we come

down there you guys cold I mean we've

got this big fire thing it is yeah it is

warm on deck you can actually see

ripples of heat billowing out of the

sides of the furnace you guys are

welcome to come aboard

all right the ship touches down lands on

its runners in the snow and just sort of

Landel ends very softly with its keel

kind of landing in snow my guess tricks

we'll just like circle down back to our

party and say I don't trust them because

they're wearing creepy masks which is

always bad and so I say you are creepy

too yeah I'm gonna let you and actually

paltin and evylyn hmm I'm gonna let all

of you actually make a let's call it an

intelligence history check to see if you

recognize costuming that these people

are wearing 1818 good six six I got a

three I'm too busy talking to myself

yeah and evylyn you recognize these

black-clad individuals those weird

costumes that they wear are an

indication that they belong to the cult

of the Dragon they are devotees of a

society of a society that basically

Revere's powerful evil dragons

so I do not like these people one has

multiple heads or yeah they might have

ties to Tiamat but they definitely truck

with evil dragons now the rock the half

elf on deck does not look at all like

them she has none of their insignias or

costume apparel or any anything visually

that compares to what they're wearing

and they seem to be taking orders from

her great information to everybody else

they're a cult I'm just Alton's just

cool no not cool evil cult that's at

that point that a small dragon was sort

of purplish red scales lands on the half

elf woman's shoulder and just so futile

leans its head out and looks at you with

great curiosity and a big smile on its

toothy face big toothy smile she's so

Whitley I made this on crack oh my god

yeah quick quick little thing I'm on

Kraft tags Mondays noon on this channel

so you don't even have to go anywhere to

find it but we've been making at my

pseudo dragon and this was a total fail

completely

but anyway very cute yeah you all see

the little dragon land on me half elf

woman's shoulder she's like evil evil

cult bad and then she says bizarre game

she's like okay okay I try to poke it

you'd have to climb up onto the deck of

the ship to reach it you want to do that

yeah I'm just like cool as you make your

way towards the ship a couple of the

crew members reach down and grab you by

the arms and pull you up onto deck all

right when you put on deck pollen you

are a bird yeah when you get on deck

Politan you're actually go

to be here because you can see coming

through sort of slats in the furnace on

deck waves and waves of glorious heat

but never mind that

dragon yes they're trying to poke the

Dragons tricks is going to walk up to

her and look very seriously scary that

hurt like actually seriously really

scary and to say if this colt here hurts

my friends this ship will be destroyed

no I don't worry about that

I'm like looking at the dragon okay as

you as you sort of stroke the dragon it

reacts the way sort of you'd expect a

cat to so it kind of you know it it

feels the the hand come down its back

and really kind of like sit and is sort

of magnetized to you in a way and what

doesn't want you to stop you can see as

you sort of make your way down that its

tail ends and a scorpion like stinger

cool I look at it I'm just like I got

something like this and a little hand

like crawls up all right yes so the

creepy hand goes up wise he's nice to me

he nice to meet you him he can't talk

summer wise we'll telepathically say to

you

sandala yeah it's probably best you keep

telling them that yeah down burn down on

the ground but even still with waffles

and Simon cuz she doesn't she feels

everyone's left so she just feels like

she can't leave them alone she's like I

like your little tiny dragon I have now

bear he's my ol bear and it will mess

you up big Albert mm-hmm you should be

also rule 22 on my track you do seem to

freak out all of

as on dollas crew they got they give you

a line you can see that their blades

don't seem to mirror any construction

you're accustomed to they've got these

short scimitar like short swords with

odd shaped handles with multiple sort of

blades and flanges on them they almost

look elven in their curvature and design

but they don't seem to be threatening

you in any way miss Roth we'll come over

to you and say captain do you want us to

rig a winch and bring that hole that's a

great question

do you guys want your wagon thing or yes

yeah yeah if you want to leave it they

won the horse and the wagon

it looks really looks like it will take

up a lot of space okay well what are you

guys talking about but just come up here

you can fly even when I looks at waffles

and Simon and realizes that they strict

snows and that they can take care of

themselves so she does she puts up there

all right kind of just hovers by the

side with their boots I think if my

first mate is skeptical about your wagon

thing I mean the horse we would probably

take the horse but you do have you do

have a harness rig that you can attach

to your winch to bring cattle and other

things on board how about that

compromise we'll take all your stuff and

I can give you a ride to wherever you're

going that's the mass of you miss Roth

just sort of grumbles Oh huh it's gonna

take an hour I interrupt honestly will

also take my son yes sir he's a good boy

we wouldn't leave any sense he means

well and miss Roth looks off the thing

and he said is that the dead guy on the

horse

no we're bringing him too he's not the

son I don't know who that is that's

that's I told you who that was that was

never mind it doesn't matter you know

well you act like I listen and you're

right and this wrath will lean into you

and says captain I don't think we have

room for a horse a dead horse and the

wagon well I mean how about I give you

guys passage to wherever you'd like to

go and you guys pick your most important

stuff you want to bring along if we want

to make good time I'm pretty sure we

need to cut some slack here uh okay

whine son in that order

Nazareth whine son get on it alright

they will make sure that the wine casks

are brought on board they will make sure

that Simon is brought on board make sure

that waffles

grab whatever more waffles kind of

strains the winch as they start pulling

hanging in the air with the harness

around her belly she's sort of heaved up

out of the air so it sort of kind of

turns different directions with the wind

you might be over beating your bear and

then you can start here that the

grinding groaning of the winch mechanism

under her weight paltin looks down at

waffles like oh the winch failed and and

then finally they'll bring up sir

Godfrey Hill he won't worry about his

horse he'll leave that behind

death will grab whatever more vital

supplies are in the wagon and just yeah

there are rations and other things um

you you said all of our stuff was

rescued by the Bustani and it was all

just kind of piled in the wagon that's

correct

do we each kind of just like recover our

own things yep because even gave a lot

of things to

others that she had not recovered from

them fair enough they would have still

had them so she can is she gonna leave

that that stuff with them still or is

she gonna reclaim all her old stuff I

guess I'm kind of asking like if all the

stuff that I gave away if if the other

characters hold on to it or if they kind

of like put that in evylyn Spile for her

yeah unless draw it actually unless the

Strix was something Strix through its

trod back in the other session assume

that you have it as part of the party

collective hoard okay so we just I still

have it yeah okay you still have I had

some things did you want them back

no I cuz even would would want the party

to keep them but if the party gives that

like left them with stuff she would take

me back a javelin one javelin javelin

that I had yeah does Colton still have

his fancy loot - yes I see you still -

cool it so Jared death still has the bag

of light fall right yes and paltin still

has Yvonne's family ring yep and there's

a lot of other things but those that you

made an important thing she's giving

it's worth mentioning now that you guys

are sort of paying attention to what

your your stuff that Strix has a lot of

stuff you haven't seen before

but there's like a big giant overstuffed

backpack of all kinds of crazy lots

of things in a new outfit but yes a cool

50 years of accumulated junk and you can

see occasionally that she also has three

puppets that looked like all of you in

her robes that she sometimes just pulls

out and looks at and then hides it hopes

that you don't see them because they're

in there she just pulls them out in this

leg kind of and it's throw the back in

so captain MS Roth comes over to you and

says where are they going to sleep well

miss Roth I think we're gonna have to

rearrange those cabins we have because

we can't keep them out here on the deck

obviously so do you want a room with

Pirela laz zelphia brass Accor troll

with me

[Laughter]

he says who named your crew come Oh

curse they came with the ship I didn't

can I think about it yes you may think

about it wonder all-new new peeps how

about we go and like talk in my quarters

real quick

sound good I won't kill you I promise

that's not for me

alright great yeah are you all going

below deck then yeah yes alright I'll

make it eyes at the masts people like

and then point at waffles like like sure

I love listening to strangers that make

promises excellent when you go down

these sort of creaky wooden steps into

the innards of this ship you can see

there's a hallway down the middle with

cabins doors to either side and a door

at the end and as and Allah will take

you into one of them where you can see

she's got a hammock strung up she's got

a small desk with a stool and a mirror

and probably not a heck of a lot else

it's it it's a fairly tight space with

all five of you packed inside but it is

private and she can close the door

behind you and you don't hear a lot of

them other that you can hear the weight

of footsteps on deck but they can't hear

you and you can't hear them

excellent so here's the deal I'm trying

to get to the spine of the world

Mountains for a secret mission and I'm

not joking I'm on a secret mission maybe

can't tell my crew they don't know I

barely know them they just there they're

like part of the rental on the boat okay

so do not did you know that they're like

an evil dragon cult thing I suspected

but I don't ask them about their

personal lives so as long as they behave

you know I don't care but yeah so I need

to get to this place and get this thing

it's a big old story

I do need help and obviously my crews a

little weird so it would be really great

to have a couple extra hands that I

could trust why do you trust us well you

don't seem rills

I mean what tipped you off you were

laying in the snow and looked like you

needed some help

but I mean I don't you also can see that

they they do brandish symbols at least

evylyn does that suggests they they

follow good deities yeah you guys look

pretty trustworthy I mean like well I

mean we are how with I've got people to

compare you to and you seem pretty good

in comparison but I mean if I should

entrust you let me know but and I can I

sense any good or evil about her I make

an insight check eleven okay and Danny

just roll a d20 die for me and tell me

what you get I got a - you believe that

she is sincere

evylyn you can you can feel waves of

sincerity coming off of her not only

that she's everything she's told you you

believe to be true but also that there

is a kind of a dispassion or an apathy

toward her crew which makes me assume

that probably she isn't part of this

evilness yes at least not this evil

right you haven't figured out why these

two things are together yet but mm-hmm

okay I asked you mentioned a secret

mission I did can you tell me what it is

you have to agree it you're gonna come

with me first

how about a year of the mission and then

I'll say it from there

all right well

[Laughter]

cool I'm one of the Harper's we are a

secret organization that keep people in

power in faerûn with the appropriate

amount of power let's say that and

there's a thing that a person has TLDR

we need to get the ring of winter away

from these people that have it up in the

mountains this ring is very powerful

they could do very bad things with it

the Harper's have sent me on a mission

to go handle this so you want us to

fight for you not fight for me

but just pour the Harper's be there in

case who are you doing this for the

Harper's are a secret organization I

know the Harper's all who are you doing

this for meddlers I know I'm one of the

Harper's so like for me but this group

of secretive people have interests in

keeping these people subdued they have

too much power currently and it could

get very bad for the entire world you

know we're really good at making things

not get real bad for the whole entire

world we may not be able to make it good

but we make it not quite so bad I'm

gonna say killing everyone around us but

you know that's fine too

on accident sometimes I think we should

do it I think we should help I think

that's why the thandor has brought us

back into this world and blessed us with

life once again

let me serve him so you've already gone

on this mission ill-prepared if you need

the help of four strangers

don't be rude dn yes me mood proper evil

it's below it is a solo mission and I

currently have no help because I can't

tell my crew they can't know so I am

looking for some backup

it was to stop us from climbing the wing

of ringer winter ourselves and then

keeping it ourselves and then we're the

bad guys

[Laughter]

he's drunk if you want to fight me for

it at the end we can do that but how

about we get how we get there when we

get there

ooh do yes you said she bite you is this

really how we negotiate real really this

is we're gonna fight you look Asterix we

will help you fighting is better than

being adrift in grey mist and feeling

nothing and seeing no one I'll take it

we've had a rough 50 years we will we

will fight with you it's fine but you

need to take us where we're going and

you need to not hurt us if you hurt any

of these people or the construct or the

owl bear you will be destroyed they were

destroyed beautiful

well in that case we're going to cronin

home any of you who want you to make

they intelligence history check it might

have a pub I got 21 13 19 walden is

trashed

fire is down the drain after not

drinking for 50 years

he's got fresh blood she's gonna yeah so

is great I'm on my half first half wine

I'm gone man I'm a cheap date now evylyn

you've heard the word Cronin hi

mentioned probably just wandering around

in Citadel ad bar but you don't really

have any context other than the dwarves

there are aware of that location and so

it's a place name you've heard before

but you've never thought to ask more

information and the dwarves never

volunteered anything so you have no

information other than that that dwarves

know the place exists wow it must be

real secret 20 that's all I know yes

it is not you you're pretty damn certain

it is not a well-known place if known by

very he's probably only known by very

few people although I guess I tell

strict status she's kind of like the

head of the negotiations I might Crona

I've heard of Cronin ham I think that's

a real secret place and Dwarves

mentioned that one's Paris

you do know when the dwarves mentioned

it they did not speak of it highly not a

place that dwarves would fancy to go it

sounded real crabby all right if you'll

only get back the ring of winter who

exactly has it now oh good question good

question I'm just gonna hand it to you

nice to have you back by the way well as

part of the Harper contacts information

I got artist Kimber was the last guy who

owned it and he went down to I think it

was Icewind Dale to get it back

I don't know how he lost it don't ask me

how he lost it but he went to go get it

back that was the last anybody seen of

him the Harper's don't talk to each

other much so this is all I have to go

off of but last we know Cronin Heim

where the ring was taken you also try

talking to each other more communicate

the key to any happy relationships good

for teamwork

and once you claim the wing what do you

plan on doing with it returning it to

the Harper's or whatever they want me to

do with it where do they keep it well

this artist guy had it and I don't know

what he was doing with it but he's he

was a really well-known well trusted

Harper we I don't know much about him

beyond his reputation but it was a very

good reputation so I couldn't tell you

what they're doing with it or what they

want to do with it now but we need to

get it out of a hand you can make a you

don't have to make a check to know that

the Harper's are an organization you've

heard of them because you come from

Waterdeep and they're there a whole

mission statement is to basically keep

power out of the hands of those who

would abuse it and they do have cells

here there and everywhere including you

believe one in water deep that sort of

operate autonomously so that they don't

if one has ever captured they can't

basically uproot the entire organization

and they do have safe houses or safe

places they do store away things that

they believe would tilt the balance of

power in evils favor you've never heard

of this artist Kimber guy so paltin is

gonna stumble over like so let me let me

see if I got all this straight so you

come down here with your magic flying

ship with your cool little dragon friend

and you say help me get this ring

because this organization that I work

for that has poor communication skills

told me to get this ring from this guy

that we don't really know and you want

us to help you cuz you thought where we

look dumb so what do you guys say

strikes the Harper's are generally a

benevolent force like rolling her eyes

at palton like we don't have a choice if

we need to get where we're going you're

right I mean I can dump you back in the

snow if you want we would we would die

in the snow and I really really don't

want to have to bring in anyone back

again die no one thank you thank you but

also a question what year is it

[Laughter]

so sandala you know that the year is

fourteen ninety yeah that that's the

year you guys would remember being in

before you went back to Berube

so we're in the same year yes well so we

went back in time 50 years past but now

we're back in the present which is still

several hundred more years yes

I'm not even going to try pretend I

understand that that's just me neither

but hey convenient okay okay sure we'll

help you yes

it's warm here it's fine even's like i

am.i 72 years old my 68 no you were dead

you don't age when you're dead

oh good okay but I'm pretty old which is

neat you know they did look pretty aged

when you dug them up strix well you know

I'm just like like placing their flesh

back on their faces

yeah that's fine well I guess we'll do

this and then would you want to take us

to what sitting in the lab are we going

oh yeah well you have three days to come

back and see the king when he mentions

that Danny is and Allah knows that

citadel ad bar is nowhere near where you

are but you could you project just

spitballing make the trip in a few weeks

probably probably do it in about a week

run this quick errand and I'll take you

wherever you want to go how about that

great yeah I would be great yeah yeah

you're sugar flames if you were if you

were to look at one of your Maps Jean

dalla you would you would say that your

current position puts you about as far

away from Citadel ad bar which is to the

east as the sword coast the sea of the

sword coast is to the west so you're

about hundreds of miles away from where

they need to go but that's not such a

big deal I got nothing to do after this

so yeah

Chris super super important question

yeah

so we're forward 50 years was I buried

with wine no and the the time that you

spent your spirit your disembodied

spirits been trapped in the mists of

Ravenloft that 50 years you didn't have

any wine there either so you were

conscious and aware and without wine for

ages you were in purgatory I was just

hoping I'd have something that might

have aged in my death it's fine it's

fine

vintage potent well you know they

wouldn't necessarily have emptied all of

your wine skins so you could have some

seriously why and tucked away in one of

those bad boys yeah but you've had

vinegar before it's not so bad

all right so Zen Dalai are you going to

give the order for liftoff yeah let's

all go back up a deck and we'll meet the

crew all right well pretend like

everything's normal

all right yeah they're they're just a

bunch of weirdos you really don't need

to fear them so they're gonna the crew

tells you they've set aside two of the

cabins for the guests for the duration

of their stay hopefully short Wow - yes

we only have four the mission is so

important we got we have six crew

members in one cabin

well they take lifts so okay so it's

really up to you guys who wants to share

cabins but two of you will be in one

cabin with hammocks one above the other

and two of you will be in a cabin across

the hall with hammocks above one above

the other I call top hammock jerks we'll

take the bottom hammock she doesn't want

to listen to evil oh is it gonna be a

Strix D F and then evil imp Alton of the

air or the girl is gonna be together and

the guys gonna

Bracey Strix doesn't see herself as into

any of those situations so she doesn't

kick her evylyn actually doesn't notice

either because she's been just like

cuddling with everyone whenever she can

either so she's like okay go Bolton's

not really noticing anything at this

point

we walk out he's just like what up crew

everything is totally normal

things are great yep Alton as the ship

takes off into the air and you feel

yourself carried on the wind a strange

feeling in your stomach starts to rise

up to your throat and you feel the deck

underneath you shift and suddenly I'd

like you to make a constitution saving

throw like it's coming back up yeah yep

oh that's that's an 18 excellent you you

hold it down Oh tasted worse the second

time

all right we're good and as you look

down and on the ship gains altitude you

see the the you've left the wagon behind

it gets smaller and smaller left in the

snow

guys we forgot the wagon well your plan

wasn't to take it right am i right about

that right just can't remember did you

guys say you were taking the horse or

leaving the horse we will probably take

the horse if I don't want it to die okay

so all right yes so the horses basically

just kind of tied off on the top deck

cool it's warm enough up here it's

awkward because you know everybody crew

constantly has to move around it becomes

a total nuisance but no more so than the

giant hulking albear who's too big to

fit down into the lower chambers

although actually she could squeeze down

there she really wanted you and chances

are one nightfall she's going to try

yeah that's pretty funny it's just like

two hammocks and then this big ball of

fur and feathers even's like sleeping in

a hammock with one arm

I think it's butt pressed up against the

portal all right comes in I'm just like

waffles get so big the journey northward

takes you into the icy mountains known

as the spine of the world these are very

sort of unfriendly almost malevolent

dark mountains with huge ice packs and

glaciers and very inhospitable um and

you would think impassable in anything

other than a flying vessel and as you

make it way through the mountains the

wind on the deck just blasts you pretty

much negating any advantage that the the

billowing heat from the furnace has to

offer but this crew is so skilled at

managing the ship that they sort of take

the ship up and down to hit currents of

wind and basically use the rising and

fall of the ship to move ever onward to

the north and beyond the mountains you

enter a region of faerun that few have

ever seen called the great glacier and

it is this massive glacial continent

practically of jagged icy peaks and

canyons and crevasses and glaciers as

old as time and a number of days pass

uneventful II you guys are accustomed

get accustomed to sleeping in the

hammocks waffles gets accustomed to

squeezing down into the lower decks and

pressing herself into the room at night

and occasionally well not occasionally

at least four or five times a night

farts and food fills the room with a

powerful powerful smell that in the

mornings you kind of have to open up the

porthole to kind of air the place out

also just so you know Deus Strix is

sleeping on the ground and a circle of

salt and she screams in her sleep

so there's sorry great sorry you don't

get to know the crew too well because

they're not very they're not brilliant

conversationalist the dragon cultists

pretty much focus entirely on running

the ship I definitely try though yes but

I would like each of you to make a

perception check to see if you notice

anything that you would consider to be a

little odd or out of the

ordinary all right Danny you don't have

to make this jack 2024 good forever

drunk for and since Anna stepped away

I'll just assume she didn't make it

she's busy doing

evylyn things before so over the course

of this trip once or twice no more than

that

strict Cindy a few both observe after

the first mate miss Roth talks to the

captain about something about navigation

stuff he does go over to another crew

member that you come to know as Althea

and speaks to her in confidence

periodically and once in a while after

speaking tune is rough she will pull

something out from her armor her her

cape like a stone or something and she

will talk into it quietly and then put

it away I know what those are but should

I do in Arcana check sure okay oh I got

a 23 you know that that's a sending

stone that is yeah transmit messages to

distant it's always connected to one

other stone so this is like kid

walkie-talkies with string between them

but no string this one obviously

connects to another stone somewhere else

I'm not happy to see that yep so

somebody has been somebody's kept

apprised of this journey northward you

don't know who and the other the other

thing you observed the two of you is

that this is always done without

seemingly the captain's knowledge mmm I

think no Danny sand Allah and Allah

knows that this is going on that they

are basically relaying messages back and

forth but she hasn't tipped her hand

cool I think we should inform the

captain I'm saying this to D it yeah

okay

when you can we need to go one at a time

we can't look suspicious you're right

there are opportunities throughout the

day where you can talk to his on doll up

in her cabin basically knock on her door

when she's actually below deck and speak

to her while the crew is topside great

you go talk to her I'll keep a lookout

all right I'll go talk to her but I'll

also make it look like I'm just gonna

complain about waffles not getting

enough food and actually you know that

that will become an issue if you're

right landfall soon you you're going

through your rations and food stores

pretty quickly with waffles on board

yeah I'll go above deck and just a

casual Strix when you go down to talk to

the captain you can see that her little

pseudo dragon Banyon is probably perched

on her desk just watching her as she

looks at some charts and stuff and all

right she's gonna walk up and your crew

has a sending stone salvia and miss Roth

are up to something you see the super I

gonna reach in and pull an apple out of

a basket and start eating it while you

talk seems to be listening very intently

to what you're saying though and do I

know that it can talk to you no it has

never talked once okay all right so I'm

gonna just say that and then say what do

you want to do about it they might be

commiserating against you and they look

like tough cutters so I don't want to

mess with that and unless you tell us -

well I am aware thanks for letting me

know but I I was aware that's part of

the reason I have you guys I'm really

not sure what they're gonna do I know

who they're talking to

it's the same person I got the ship from

they like I said came with the package

this ship doesn't belong to me it's a

loaner but the the crew came with them

kind of I mean anything they're saying

to the owner of the ship it's nothing I

don't know do you want us to find out

what they're doing we have the ability

to spy on them I mean if you're real

worried about it I'd say go ahead but

I'm I'm not I'm worried about everything

but that's

and y-you say I'm not worried about it I

think that worries you aren't always

your your crew is trained to actually

man the ship so you kind of need them

for that at the bare minimum so yeah I'd

rather not piss them off I don't know

what they're gonna do I don't know a ton

about them so if I know what's going on

nothing's in danger right now I wouldn't

worry about it you all are safe I

promise but thank you for being honest

with me I love all this communication I

think I'm gonna tell the Harper's that

this is totally wish I'll be doing

mostly I was just gonna roll her eyes

and take the Apple from dumb little

dragon eat it as she walks up the door

all right

it just watches you in utter disbelief

as you and then the little dragon will

turn to use Andolan telepathy say did

you see what she did

just oh my Apple and I'll telepathically

say I know all right once Strix gets

back on deck she's she's gonna pull DF

back into their room and tell them all

this and then also say I would like to

personally spy on them and know what's

going to happen I agree we should at

least know who they're trying to talk to

okay enjoy this many secrets how do you

want to go about spying on them now you

know that they take shifts typically

four of them work at any given time and

the other two are asleep in their

hammocks down below and the four of them

seem to man the ship quite Abele other

than that now have we noticed a pattern

of sorts of the when and yes they follow

a very strict rotation scheme each

working for about eight hours a day

actually more than that and they have a

way about them that's easily easily

predicted they kind of have a pattern

that they fall into where you can tell

you can sort of gauge after a few days

where any of them is going to be at any

given time great and this encounted is

meeting with ms roth and solve the

attends to

and usually only once every couple days

and it's it's always in the morning

right okay well just knowing that we

could try to set ourselves up or at

least one of us somewhere around there

to try to at least listen in I always

say that's that's pretty much the only

way you could do it because the deck of

the ship is not big enough to stand and

not be seen right I'm not him because

he's been drunk for the past like

however long we've been grappling so we

can't trust him to listen to anyone but

thankfully I don't think it'd be hard to

convince him to turn us invisible true

look II hate wait am I in the room just

like I'm right all right that's cool

great yeah you know palton can make

things invisible with his mandolin

alright well I can do it you are the

stealthiest you should definitely do it

we know what happens when any of us

other than you try to hide all right

since you're invisible yeah I'm gonna

give you advantage on your stealth check

the next time you see miss Roth and zall

via car together alright so then

whenever like they're our next meeting

cabins yeah let's be there ready for it

misterx will open also bundle some

blankets in the top hammock that just

looked like a person in case anyone

comes in that's where he is nice and I

will be like talking to the bundle like

hey man okay how'd you do it yep 27

outstanding they do not notice you at

all and you can see that essentially

miss Roth is just telling zelphia to

report on how close they are to reaching

cronin hime that they've seen no frost

giants

and that they expect to arrive at that

there that they they basically pray as

their employer they apprise their

employer of when they expect to arrive

at Cronin Heim and that they expect to

encounter frost giants there they and

after he tells her that she communicates

everything through the sending stone in

draconic so whoever she's speaking to

obviously understands and uses that

language okay I'll try to at least

remember specific Turkic words even if I

can't from them so cross them properly

yep just just try like whatever I don't

remember what watch is I try to pick a

few and try to remember how they said

phonetically okay done all right

and then after that meeting is over I'll

return to Strix and D visible right do

you visible visible yeah and just be

like okay didn't go great

turns out they speak in different

languages does anyone know what the

words drawl go Tory salad occur I think

was one I heard are you joking do you

need some water

Alton give him some wine quit Oh Lord

all portal was in there for sure like

four times at least make an in check do

you have to see how well you recount the

words okay I think DF possessed speaking

in tongues okay so you're able to

basically say the words as you heard

them very accurately Oh

who speaks Turkic none of us I was just

gonna say we gotta go telecasted you

want to speak to demons I can help you

but I don't know at all I just said all

these Road URLs like your sounded like

you were going barmy I mean Paulson's

been talking to your sack up there so I

don't know let's go tell the captain

oh all right remember that okay I'll go

and meet up with the captain

are we all going this time sure look

that all together okay

okay I'm down under the deck saying hi

to the air elemental that makes my

propeller go her name is Gail alright

you tap on Gail's door and kind of see

her blustering inside her little

confined space at the back of the ship

and yes as you do the waffle crew comes

up behind you so that when you turn

they're all like right there death is

quite uncomfortable at this confinement

area and stays will blow waves back okay

hey guys hey yeah sorry you told us not

to spy on anyone but you know I did we

did it anyway so tell her the words that

the barmy words you heard torna girl was

just like a walk and they'll try to

recount whatever all right the words

that he told he spills out our first

when and winter hmm well good job guys

[Laughter]

hi telepath to summarize and I say his

accent was horrible I haven't mentioned

us before but it is worth noting that

since you now know Kevin's onlin been

around her very closely that the

freckles on her face aren't freckles at

all but actually scales he's got very

soft sort of scales that are sort of a

goldish white color trailing down her

face and down her neck have we ever seen

anyone with something like that before

yeah so evens like ah how did you get

that done that looks so cool

well it's very expensive just kidding um

I was born this way uh I have a dry

conic bloodline and just how I came out

evil Enfocus cool

okay I know it's sparkly anyway so you

guys found out a whole lot nothing

yeah at that point you hear one of the

crewmen call out captain I gotta go see

what's what's up yeah that's that's fine

when you go upside drops will swell

point and say we we've arrived

and as you look down in the sort of it's

sort of late afternoon early evening and

there's a light snow falling from the

sky and it's overcast

you have drifted over a canyon like a

Grand Canyon but made of ice and as you

look down into the canyon there is a

section of it that's sort of closed off

with riff deep rifts leading into it and

in a wider area you can see there are

giant buildings built into the ice these

buildings made of stone and wood most of

them are sort of embedded in the ice and

only protrude slightly but this you know

based on your research is the frost

giant village of Cronin Hyman burn here

guys

when the rest of you come topside you

can see in the canyon these gigantic

buildings far below through even through

the snow it's you can sense the scale of

them there

they are massive and sort of arrayed in

a ring all these sort of gigantic lodges

with a big open plaza or just open space

between them certain like giant size yes

like they were built for and by

creatures that stand well over 20 feet

tall giant skies damn it

sick

and me what did you guys think was up

here not dad's Brassica will ask you

captain should we begin our descent yes

all right right what exactly is our

planet and our goal here land well I

mean first step was getting here yeah I

don't know who has it we need to figure

that out reconnaissance as you sort of

slowly circle down word and this place

comes into view you can see that there

are five big lodges all faced inward

their back ends embedded in the glacial

ice so really only their facades and

only the front end of each building

protrudes from the ice and they have big

steps leading up to open doorways some

of them have spires stone spires that

stick out of their roofs at the top but

they've all got these sort of steep

pitched Lodge like roofs and at the top

of these spires you see these sort of

carved draconic emblems carved into the

wood the very wood of the structure of

the building now the plaza in the front

is not empty as you descend you see what

appeared to be the frozen corpses of

what might be a dozen frost giants just

lying there yeah the plaza the the plaza

of this town is strewn with dead Giants

you can also see amid them what appear

to be a couple dead animals

wolves possibly but they're as big as

polar bears whoa and I don't know what's

going on guys from here go ahead

can I see any sense of recent activity

or footsteps or the lodges themselves

from this altitude still no but you

think once you get down on the ground

that will be more obvious all right now

these buildings

despite being 60 70 feet tall are

dwarfed by the ice

walls of the canyon in which they

contain in which they're contained which

are almost 300 feet high so as the

balloon makes its descent the icy walls

of the canyon begin to surround you on

all sides until you come down and land

amid the buildings the runners of the

ship sort of crunching on the ice as the

vessel touches down and that's when you

see that many of these corpses some of

them are lying face down some of them

face up some of them on their side

it looks like they've been in the ice

for in the cold just sort of with snow

and accumulating on them as it falls

down into the canyon then we don't see

any signs of life the snow that's been

falling has obliterated the tracks that

death was hoping to see well this is not

recent all of the lodges have big gaping

open doorways some with like what appear

to be sheets of stitched animal furs

very sort of crude doors I guess you

could call that more like curtains but

most of them are sort of flapping and

blowing in the wind so you can kind of

see the dark into the dark frozen

interior of these buildings you don't

have to do close inspection to see that

some of these corpses are so mutilated

to suggest that they were torn apart by

something much bigger than they are

what oh my god I'm so sorry guys you

kind of disembarks and goes and examines

the corpses and at each one she seems

very disturbed when they're there you're

sort of fluttering over them yeah and

she kind of says a little blessing of

Lysander over each one as she goes yeah

you can see some of them have like their

their axes are still sort of clutched in

their hand they're big gigantic but

these are all like they all look like

harsh snag

big frost giants male and female looked

like they were in a pitched battle here

out in the open and were rent apart by

giant claws and teeth yes and on the

deck while you're doing that yeah

a perception check I'm on the boat sale

good 24 you here two of the dragon

cultists trawled and Pirela basically

turn to each other in they go what and

you know dragon cultists would know that

kind of thing I'm sorry

Pauline was just like well we didn't

want to deal with frost giants so bright

side to everything fam dragons better

can maybe can I make a perception check

to see if we should be in view in the

middle of town here or not does it feel

safe to be out in the open it it

actually a little bit safer for you to

be out in the open because at least if

something were to come let's say running

out of those lodges you would have time

to get airborne Oh before they got to

you so there's also like from here

there's very little hidden from you you

can kind of see the facades of all the

five buildings around you there's a

great split in one wall that leads to

that's basically a way out in one

direction sort of a canyon fissure and

then there's another split on the far

side same thing going off in a different

direction into the greater canyon next

to one of those you can see sort of

underneath the snow what appears to be a

giant sled giant sized frost giant sized

sled cool noted yep question as even

does all this scouting evil you can see

that a lot of these giants that you're

scouting they're wearing mammoth skins

and they have tusks on their horns and

it looks like all of their armor and

paraphernalia has been sort of cobbled

together in sort of a crude kind of

almost caveman-esque

away Oh so their weapons wouldn't be

like a fine maker II know they're like

chiseled stone axes with wrapped around

big dragon bone handles like Evelyn was

just very interested in what type of

weapons cross transmite your big axe

some feather down here des will turn to

sandala and say and you have no idea

where we're supposed to start looking

for this thing I told you the Harper's

are really bad at communication

this is all the info I had so I'm just

as surprised as you are

honestly are there any kind of

underground passages or dungeon treated

to keep here just the lodges uh that's a

very good questions on dalla you don't

know it but knowing knowing knowing for

science Jean dalla you would speculate

that there are probably passages through

the ice like deeper caves behind the

lodges where they keep their their

cellars and mittens and other things

like that I will relay that to DES but I

will also mention that that's probably

not important and it's super

blisteringly cold here you all find evil

and I got troubled in the least you feel

none of it there's like icicles hanging

from my nose I'm sorry Audrey will come

down off the deck and sort of drop down

onto the snow and the ice and look

around he's got his he draws his sword

and this ring is it actually you know

ring size or am I looking for something

the size of a water wheel you know that

the ring of winter resizes to fit the

finger of its wearer

so it's terribly really big right now if

sir Godfrey's drilling his sword then

Strix is he's obviously seeing something

that maybe we don't so she's just gonna

cast mage armor on herself

and tell everyone to just stay back

towards the ship

I get evil and out of there

gosh I gotta say I don't like it I don't

like it either but we need to figure

this out

well will you start looking right so

sandala off you go

mom I go yep we'll follow you all right

is there is there a Hut that seems to

have smoke coming from it or any sign of

activity at all nope all five of the

huge lodges there massive structures are

ice-covered kind of dark hauntingly

quiet gotcha

but if you need a hut I got you fam that

is very helpful sir thank you you can

see that your crew is waiting for your

next order well I think we need to check

out one of these huts at least just to

be sure there's nobody around we aren't

aware of before we get comfy miss Roth

will confide in you that he believes

that these Giants were killed by a white

dragon do any of us know anything about

white dragons you said once as cool as

you were as you were making your way

across an icy lake you saw a white

dragon and you feared it saw you and so

you would withdrew into a ranger Lodge

shortly thereafter befriending hoody his

mother yes thanks for reminding us of

that I don't hate her I'm sad what is a

libéré tastes like I come from waffles

ears like fish chicken yeah tasty

look anyway there's no white dragon here

right now right so fertile look we need

to look now and fast I agree

this one is smart even still buzzing

around she hasn't been paying any

attention she's still out there miss

Roffe looks at you as Andolan says are

we leaving anyone on the ship

the MS Roth has a point should does

anybody want to stay behind on the ship

evylyn seems we're not leaving anybody

behind

so all right well I can watch over the

ship all righty you do that sir more

like take the ship when we're not

looking at my right yes

now that's why we're bringing the

captain they can't go there without me I

promise misterx is gonna tell Godfrey

just to make sure that the ship doesn't

leave you say yeah I will be waiting for

you when you get back you're a practical

man mr. Godfrey Sheriff

can I ask summer wise to stay on the

ship as well yes well sweet I think we

should leave waffles on the ship as well

I agree I don't I don't want that thing

if a thing shows does show up it's gonna

be that much harder to get her back onto

the ship in time it's best we keep her

there yeah agreed

aye

then if something goes wrong Godfrey and

waffles teram yeah so I hop over the

side okay the ship yeah into the snow as

do your crew members and as these dragon

cultists they just sort of throw

themselves over the deck of the ship and

they kind of spread the wings of their

black leather capes that seemed to

soften their descent and they all just

land like birds pretty cool they're

creepy I know I into the nearest lodge

so there's a big one and then there are

four smaller ones that all the smaller

ones seemed to bear striking resemblance

lodges the big one that you're staring

at looks more like a royal kind of

edifice about 25% bigger than the others

and it's got a big Mastodon skull

mounted above its gigantic doors big I

want to check that one's okay let's go

let's go for that one when you go in

that direction

everybody can make a survival check

that's a wisdom check if you don't have

the survival skill and I'll make it for

the drag dragon cultists oh did you say

wisdom wisdom all right when 3:23 Wow

okay I have survival now we'll give it

to the Strix here so Strix as your small

army of people starts to march toward

this giant huge massive looming

structure with a big gaping doorway

leading into darkness you're looking

around nervously walking past the frozen

corpses of slaughtered dismembered frost

giants the silence echoing except for

the occasional crack of ice from some

piece of ice breaking off somewhere way

down in one of the rifts are down in the

canyon somewhere and just echoing toward

you this horrible horrible crack sound

it just happens it doesn't you don't

think it's anything was deliberately

making it it's just nature

it's getting pretty the the darkness is

starting to fall in the place the light

above seems to be retreating the snow is

light but continuing to fall

wind blows through stirring things up

but the most disturbing thing of all is

just the crunching of all of your feet

on the ice underfoot it's just sort of

like marching toward your doom kind of

sound in your mind and that's when you

notice meandering between two corpses

and going up the side of the steps

leading up to this great Lodge you spot

a set of tracks too small too small to

have been seen otherwise

and as you go over and you inspect them

you see they are the tracks of a lone

human or humanoid somebody with somebody

with boots on human-scale

has made its way his or her way up from

the rift up into the lodge recently so

recently that the snow hasn't yet

completely covered them

oh alright we got a we got a hurry

this there's there's a purse stretch

lowest point she can't really articulate

it she's like that so we're all still on

the steps yeah you get to the steps and

these are giant sized steps so you can't

just walk up the normally to pull

yourself up onto them and then clamour

up this clamor up the steps and when you

get up to the top of them

you're about 15 feet above the the

ground that you were standing on

previously and you're on stone now

standing in the mouth of a great doorway

under this Mastodon skull and looking

into a gigantic feast hall the type that

you would see in a Viking lodge it's

just this sort of pit in the middle with

piled wood where fires would burn

theoretically but none is there's

nothing there it's just an empty pit

with benches on each side of the pit and

great icy pit ice covered pillars stone

pillars supporting the huge vaulted

ceiling the walls are strung with animal

skins and trophies skulls of creatures

not found in too many places and fair in

including something some that look like

Dragons skulls and they Hall goes so far

back into the dark glacier that you're

the light just sort of fails you Strix

you have dark vision mm-hmm

some dala you have dark vision okay your

dragon cultists even though they're

human have dark vision

evylyn paltin and DF do not however so

you three can't see very far into this

dark feast hall those who can can see at

the very back of the feast hall between

two giant ice-covered pillars is a big

chair covered with skins and piled

around the chair are all kinds of tiny

white objects that look like they might

be skulls like human skulls and to each

side of that huge chair is a doorway

leading deeper into the lodge so two big

gaping doorways with animal skins

hanging down in curtains before them but

there's this wind tunnel effect that

happens wind seems to come past you blow

through the lodge and cause those skins

those curtains to each side of the

distant throne to flap and flap and flap

and that's the only noise you hear

inside did Strix point out these tracks

for everyone to see I don't know yes she

pointed I don't know if she can

interpret that these are human tracks or

humanoid tracks and a singular single

individual so I mean obviously we need

to find whoever made those tracks first

can we see if these tracks continue on

inside the lodge they do but then they

do something kind of weird

they go over they skirt around the edge

of the feast hall they don't go down the

middle of the feast all they stay

against the walls and then at one point

they stop they cross over to a pillar

and then you see evidence of whoever

made these tracks must have climbed the

pillar using something on his or her

boots like hooks or Pitons or something

to basically dig into the ice and they

whoever it was clearly went up the

pillar and you see this criss cross of

rafters way up high about 60 feet up off

the ground that's where they must have

gone oh boy I'm gonna immediately fly up

there with my broom and see IO strikes

you gonna go with her Yeah right

don't step anywhere they didn't step

maybe there's traps as the two of you to

get lie up make perception checks even

when you thought about traps so you

I'm 72 now I have life experience okay

I'm 14 I got a nine when do you fly up

there you can see what appears to be a

gigantic just massive alpine horn

suspended from the ceiling by great

giant corded ropes and it looks like

they're affixed to pulleys that are then

lashed to walls and this horn can be

basically raised and lowered from the

ceiling down to where it could be say

blown by a frost giant but right now

it's in its raised position it's just

sort of hanging there and kind of

creaking in the wind even though it's

absolutely massive this horn is about

3540 feet long and you look around you

don't see any signs of a small human

sized individual lurking up there we

just see kind of like the end of the

climbing and then yes there's there's

not much in the way of snow that

accumulates on top of the rafters so

there's not much in the way of tracks

once once he or she got up here there

wasn't much sign till for them to leave

behind

evylyn peeks inside the horn Wow when

you do that your voice does carry and

the effect is you hear something at the

back of the lodge move and whatever it

is is Titanic oh and then you hear three

voices distinct overlapping one another

not you are standing down below and

those of you who are up high see one of

those billowing curtains pull away and a

giant 30-foot tall creature stride into

the hall this creature is a frost giant

bigger than harsh nag with all kinds of

frozen head

it's tied around its waist but what

strikes you as most jarring and alarming

about this behemoth is that it has not

one not two but three heads seeing this

and like I think I'm caps alright and we

will pick up yes in the finale of season

two of dice next week same bat-time same

bat-channel

alright so congratulations

yeah yeah and I trust the trust Danny
