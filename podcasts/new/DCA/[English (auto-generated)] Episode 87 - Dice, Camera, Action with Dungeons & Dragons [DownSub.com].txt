hey everybody welcome to dice camera

action you Chris now that we got

the pleasantries out of the way allow me

to recap from recent episodes the waffle

crew having saved paltin from the

influence of the ring of winter traveled

westward in a coach pulled by an ogre

zombie which went over a cliff

taking evil and with it and wounding her

quite substantially so that when the

characters decided to see if there was a

shadow crossing near this beach of Bones

upon which they found themselves they

were led into a tunnel an old ancient

tunnel that looked like it would been

carved out by some sort of death cult

and as they went inside as paltin went

inside lighting the way with his candle

they discovered that there was this

crack in the ceiling of this tunnel and

therein lie a monster and the monster

grappled Strix and it grappled evylyn

and then a teleported away and the party

went after it and d/f got this major

huge stabby stabby in the midst of the

chaos then there was some bone crunching

noises and some rending of metal and

long story short evil ins construct body

was torn asunder by the creature and her

spirit shunted into me sole monger Strix

was knocked unconscious

not long after detonating a fireball

that swept down and consumed little

simon who had just learned how to speak

DF was able to smother his flaming body

with a wet blanket

evylyn trapped in the soul monger met

the spirits of some other folk also

trapped in the soul monger doomed to

have their souls devoured forever by

this horrible horrible gigantic creature

evylyn sacrificed herself by flying up

into the umbilical of it and being

swallowed by it but then through the

power of her faith and her belief in all

that is good Justin

light she unleashed a can of sunshine in

the heart of the creature and I'm all

out of bubble and you're all out of

bubblegum back in the shadow fell DF and

paltin you're both conscious albeit I

believe fairly badly off at this point

but you felt the uplifting of the death

curse that had passed although it didn't

change your current hit points you do

feel at least now that healing can have

an effect on you and restore you to

where you should be it is at that moment

in this darkened tunnel where all you

can see is smoke lingering from the

fireball the light of Paul Tain's candle

and you can hear the crashing of waves

from the sea outside there is an

exciting explosion of bright light from

somewhere far far far outside so bright

that it illuminates the beach and it's

wreckage and the tunnel you're in in

sort of a bright amber light from

outside yeah where before there was just

grey grey fog and clouds and sort of

perpetual shadow fell colorlessness

there is a bright blast of light that

shines within the tunnel and it's when

you look out toward the light it's like

you're looking directly into like a

sunset that just sort of caught you

right at the right moment to shine it's

light directly upon you when the death

curse was lifted

did we feel or see or notice the

physical changes on our body kind of

start to fade no they don't fade they're

still lingering you just feel it's like

this invisible weight that's been

bearing down on you and it's been

bearing down on you for a such a long

time that it's lifting is actually you

can feel it okay

do i oh good

no you go ahead nothing wit conscious

that's true yep with the with the death

curse lifting do I have an idea of what

that means in regard to how that was

done how the how the death curse was

lifted yeah it seemed well you you don't

know exactly how it was done you you did

not see it happen you're not even

technically on the same plane as where

the where the death curse originates but

something in your being suggests that

the timing of evil and death and this

event that can't be a coincidence in

your mind okay Alton is silent yeah and

you've still got like I think you've

still got evil ins head

Talton a is very silent okay just

staring at it okay

dia and paulten I'd like you to make

perception checks 13 also 13 oh okay the

light from outside that sunset in the

shadow fell seems to subside and it be

as the light disappears almost like the

Sun going down or something it becomes

kind of dark in here once more except of

course for Paul Tunes candle I don't

remember there any other light sources

at the moment besides that because they

sort of spit out these out yeah candle

yeah two of you are kind of looking at

each other in this dim light of the

candle Strix lying near deaths feet and

you hear a sound

that's like right and you realize it's

actually coming from

Evelyn's torso oh no I'm gonna go to

eelain's torso and oh I comfortable cuz

I'm not trying to feel evylyn up but I

need to find the part of her chest that

opens up to let juniper out okay when

you do and you pop it open you see that

juniper is alive and well

scuttling around scratching at the

insides of that little lives in all

right I'll retrieve juniper okay and

bring her over to Strix is unconscious

body and just let her burrow and it's

the most natural place for her to go

right now yeah she actually sort of

crawls up the robes and up and just sort

of pushes herself up under Strix is hat

and then she sort of comes out through a

hole about halfway up the Hat looks

around her head sticking out of the hole

I'm gonna take a moment you quick check

the outside to see if I can see a

visible difference at all from where

this light kind of came from okay when

you stand out at the mouth of the tunnel

you kind of have to edge your way past

waffles who's just sort of sitting there

taking up space but when you go out

you're sort of hit by the the the cold

chill air of the shadow fell coming up

off the gloomy gloomy water you see just

the tiniest pinpoint of orange light now

in the sky through the clouds and fog

and even that's getting fainter and

fainter and fainter it's almost like

there was an explosion off way the frack

over like miles and miles and miles

miles out to sea all right and then you

look all around you and you see the

waves crashing up against the rotting

hulks of all these dark ships that have

crashed here over the years

discouraging their cruise and such onto

the beach okay I'll return back to

paltin and Strix

and I'll just always sit down next to

Strix okay I just kind of address the

room do anyone who would listen like

it's judge distorts paltin but not

actually necessarily directed at him and

almost psychotic sitting down arms on my

knees and looking down at the ground

death will say that's twice now that

she's saved us from death by giving into

her own

and if nothing else could this count as

a short rest I was just gonna say

without any other business to attend to

yes you the three of you can take a

short rest which means you can spend

your hit dice regain hit points remember

every hit die you spend you also add

your Constitution bonus to that number

of hit points you get back and this also

applies to Strix so strict so you are

going to wake up at the end of this rest

hopefully with more hit points than you

had all thanks to des ministrations

haphazard though they made a bit and

Strix as you look around you can see

palton is holding basically half a stub

of candle now and the remains of evil

and scattered about and a wet blanket on

top of sauna and I didn't see her die

that is correct

right I'm spending all of my hit dice to

heal okay I am back up to 45 hit points

pretty good oh okay uh mister conscience

now yes

okay strikes there's you feel something

crawling around you and it turns out

it's juniper the the mouse seems to be

looking for a way right now a way to get

in your tummy no it's like trying to

find your compartment I just like it

register the mouse first I can look over

to what's I guess what's left of evil

and she's just standing there and

staring at it and just not even knowing

what to say like it's just it's it's not

it's not it's not real it's this isn't

real right

and it's not alright yes we'll start

either using that blanket to form a sort

of knapsack or even clearing things out

of his backpack

sorry easier to collect start collecting

together the pieces of evil and yeah you

gather all the pieces together yeah and

then just try to find a way that they we

can transport them wait no no stop nice

is like trying to stop and like stop no

this no and we're not leaving her here

she just starts crying this can't be

happening I just can't I really can't

she'll just sit on the ground and the

pile okay just just hold some of the

pieces in her hands yep there's also the

sword that she had and her other weapons

lying around as well you can collect oh

sorry mate

yeah Paul's just like it's it's not

she'll be back she it something's

something's gonna happen she's she's

stubborn

and she wouldn't she wouldn't let it

happen like this like that'd be stupid

who's wearing the protection rings yes

we wearing one mhm

I think strix had the other one last

yeah alright so the after paulten says

that des will say that's right she's not

gone we know how this works

anyone who parish this gets consumed by

the soul monger and their soul is gone

and too bad for that thing he couldn't

handle evylyn but her soul is not

destroyed it's not gone and DF will

remove a glob and show the ring of

protection we

still have her soul we can I don't know

how or no Strix you know magic maybe you

know something but we can still get her

back I can't do this kind of magic

there's nothing we can do it'll find

someone who can I figured there's a

there might be like a prayer but evylyn

says at night over her party mm-hmm sort

of like a hymn and so when she got when

everyone goes to bed so Strix just

starts to say it out loud

kind of like changing it in her own way

and she just says almost as evil incest

it she says morning lord thank you for

evylyn the gift you left in your service

bless her her hands and this her body to

rest well for your good work bless those

these around her in her charge and blast

deaath and Paulson and me the night and

warmth and safety as the Sun sets may

your light still shine from within us as

we await the dawn I don't think it's

gonna come but we're gonna wait it

anyway she just holds juniper out she

doesn't pray because she thinks that's

dumb yeah occasionally you hear waffles

just make us sound like okay we still

have to find a way out of here near wait

no I have an idea I do know magic I'm

sorry I said I didn't and she'll cast um

animate object on the armor okay so you

cast the spell just checking to see if

it's in action think it's

what you're gonna watch she cast a spell

with just a quick verbal and somatic

component and then the pieces of evil in

kind of assemble themselves into a

marionette like form before you and

she'll also take a piece of robe and

cover up her eyes so they don't like

doll like roll back in her head a bunch

of times so her head sort of lolling

around a bit as she assembles and her

arms are kind of assembling themselves

yeah and then she'll transform her staff

into the lantern and just kind of put it

in where a Juniper usually sits so that

there's a light inside of her okay so

there's this your eerie green light

coming as this thing is sort of

shambling around miss tricks is like see

it's the best I could do

Chris knowing animated object I I can

like recognize what's happening

instantly right yes absolutely

I see this and I turn to Strix I'm just

like stop I get off I can't care if none

of us could carry it it's too heavy it's

this isn't that I don't that's not right

that's messed up do you want to put it

can be a ghost Paulding doesn't actually

grieving just like how about I don't

know can you you see it just sort of

just there with its saggy shoulders its

head sort of off to one side just

standing waiting for a command rotation

some flowers over it

can I just I'm just like all right I'm

just like like how about how about this

can I can I

cast invisibility on it let me just

check don't want to look at that I'm

just checking to see if it affects

objects as well as creatures effects

creature so know right this doesn't

qualify as a creature and I'm sorry and

still just make it fall apart

well just put it on the back of waffles

alright so it all cascades down in the

rain with metal back down the floor I

think I'm with Bolton on this one I

don't want that now you're trying to

help her it's it's fine I don't this

just it's done so that that works

alright see my lantern back okay you

take your lantern back and you start to

put pieces of her into des backpack so

that can be worn over I guess waffle

right what do you do it like yeah I he's

a little bit of rope between that the

bag and near the backpack have you

collect up as much as possible and

fashiona sort of awful harness okay just

kind of put over waffles

alright Oh what waffles sits there and

just waits until it's all sort of loaded

on yeah that mix is really crestfallen

then no one liked her magic that she

tried and then I refining a way out of

here god damn it there's also the burnt

husk of Simon still lying on the floor

yep so is it it's still like solid it's

not just like oh this scratches it

wasn't but it wasn't it wasn't turned to

dust or blown to pieces or ripped pieces

off he was just badly scorched he looks

like a match tip basically does it look

salvageable

[Music]

Makana check oh good please oh that is

he not 20 oh yeah my dad son is so dead

if it was just a matter of like

replacing a toy or a construct you'd say

this thing is really beyond salvation

and you just want to build a new one

but since Simon seemed to be or at least

have a actual living soul or something

inside him giving him a semblance of

real life you don't believe that will

work so it's possible he could be I have

like parts of him replaced or that magic

might be able to undo the damage that's

gonna take more than a mending spell but

maybe not much more you know can can I

also pack Simon's parts onto waffles yes

happily carry both of those small

figures I'm just like I just like to see

just waffles carrying this

evylyn and Simon I'm just like okay it's

temporary thing you just gotta get there

this is this is this is fixable this is

we've we've dealt with worse probably I

don't know it's it's good all right

anyway where are we going or work cool

let's go

mmm one step at a time all right I was

just gonna start going okay as you begin

to make your way forward you see that

the passage ahead of you seems to

darkened before your eyes almost like a

creeping Nomad almost like a creeping

magical darkness is just sort of

swelling no no no no no no as the candle

sort of gets close to it you can almost

see the candle light hitting the

of the darkness but not penetrating it

can I try and dispel magic on that sure

can all right I'm gonna do that to do

you are automatically successful as you

cast a spell magic the darkness seems to

retreat away from it and you see what

you saw before which is a tunnel going

on for about another 30 feet and then

coming to a tee where it's gonna go left

and right who cast this darkness you

didn't see good I mean someone's here or

something is here you can make

perception checks if you want I would

like to see if you detect here see you

smell anything I buy I got a dirty 2000

I got natural 20 oh wow 18 total 31 you

all feel the presence of something

nearby you hear what almost sounds like

a flapping robe like somebody

withdrawing or retreating which

direction is it coming from or where's

it going to the right whatever I had to

do I did it

I sensed the the ring coming in here

right you did that has passed no longer

sense it can I hasten my way forward and

just try to appear on the course if I

could see anyone sneaking off or doing

some you sure Ken when you hurry

around the corner you peer you can see

that the tunnel goes about 30 feet and

then bends to the left but standing at

the corner sort of turning around to

look back at you is what you think is

death a black-robed figure with a skull

like face

ah I really want to say something snarky

Adam but I don't think it's a good idea

to do so in the face of death Paul's

just like with cesium what's there

what's going on yeah yeah I see them

okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go up to where

death is okay

yeah as paltin comes up alongside you

and peers around the corner you see that

figure retreat down the hall out of view

it sort of does this kind of weird spin

around like turn its back on you and

then kind of spin around the corner and

the last thing you all you see paltin is

like a little bit of torn fabric of the

black tattered robe disappear around the

next corner

was it was that them who is that what

was that and then you're both here it's

like who's cackling who dares cackle at

me what's going on what was that do you

know him

no I don't know her or her palton your

candle goes out oh no as Strix will

run up behind them okay it's okay I have

another cam to say oh okay all right

evylyn you are being tossed up into the

air

it is a bright sunny morning and as you

reach the apex of your upward journey

you begin to fall and then someone

catches you and you look into the eyes

of your father and he is smiling and he

throws you up into the air again your

face sort of beams in the sunlight and

then you come back down into his arms

and you're you seem to be laughing and

he is laughing as well I recognize this

as something that has happened before

right yeah you this you're you're a

child and this is your this is a memory

of your dad I yell daddy and I wrap my

arms around his neck all right it's not

going to him and he he does the same

thing and he says sunlight and I yep you

can see as you're being spun around in

his arms the memories flood back into

you of the the place you grew up and

just how sort of beautiful and serene it

was I'm kind of out of the way off the

beaten path very much a natural place

and everything kind of has a organic

natural shape to it and the the Sun is

as warm on you that as you've ever

remembered it before but even more so

the warmth of your father and just the

smell of him is something you haven't

remembered in a long long time and he

says one more for good luck

yes all right here we go

you ready grab the Sun this time and he

throws you up in the air and you you

just sort of reach up toward the ball of

morning light in the sky and as you do

you land in another place you can see

that you are on the side of a grassy

hill and there is a big blooming tree

covered with blossoms pink blossoms on

top of the hill and there is a swing

hanging down from one of the branches of

the tree and there is a child swinging

in the swing and a woman pushing the

child from behind and they seem to be

laughing gaily and having a great time

you can also hear the sound of other

children in the area but sort of further

down the hill and you can see some heads

bobbing up and down in flower fields and

from behind rocks

they're playing some sort of game down

below but up here on the on the hillside

there's this tree to swing this boy and

this woman and you look around you don't

see your father and you are as you were

before you became a construct do I

recognize the woman or the boy yes

the woman is when you gaze at her at

first you're not exactly sure who she is

part of it is because the Sun is sort of

coming a bit from behind them so they're

a little backlit but as you make your

way toward them and you start to hear

her voice she is xerath the priest you

met in the soul monger but when you look

at her she looks like she's about 40

years younger still you know a middle

aged woman but not the gray-haired

feeble looking woman you saw mere

moments ago the young boy is the one

that she was is now the flesh-and-blood

version of the Specter you saw back in

the soul monger who she was looking

after and he's in the swing having a

grand old time

and when she sees you his arrest she

waves I call out to her arrest I walk

over and I say where are we where do you

think I told Dartmouth at the morning

Lord would protect us and for once I was

right I imagine you're you're right a

lot of the time I'm your biggest fan

you'd be surprised how often I'm wrong

you think wisdom would come with years

but I made more mistakes in my last 20

years of life than I did my first 20

well and who's this I hold my hand out

to the boy I'm door to my door Tamar and

Catherine pleased to meet you door

Toomer me smiles you I asked the rest do

you do you know what happened well we

weren't annihilated had you also been

annihilated you wouldn't be here and

neither would I none of us would be I

guess I just I didn't really know what

to expect once we got here here as you

look around you can see there are

beautiful Peaks and mountains

birds singing it's like perpetual spring

it's like the sweetest moment of

springtime all around you a second ago I

saw I saw my dad deep have you seen a a

real jolly looking blond guy around no

but he sounds very tantalizing I mean I

suppose Oh forgive me I'm actually

beyond such things now aren't I and she

looks at me I know how it works up here

hmm and she says some say that the soul

is the greatest gift that the multiple

upon a person and you even saved

thousands of souls I mean I've heard

murmurings of sainthood no I mean you

you thought of it just as much as I did

it wasn't just me you were the one with

the worm and the Apple thing and you

know and I wouldn't have even I wouldn't

have even known what to do if not first

I have offered so many prayers to the

morning Lord over the years he owed me

one

and I don't know I mean I wouldn't even

be Who I am or know the things I know

without the the friends I left behind so

um as you're talking to her you can see

that there is sort of a faint very very

faint aura around her at first you

thought it was just the sunlight coming

up from behind her but it's not true she

has her own aura and so does the boy and

so do the kids farther down the hill and

so do you your aura and the boy's aura

is sort of a silvery colour Cerises

is bright gold we're glowing hmm yes how

come yours is gold I died a natural

death the years took me at the appointed

hour this is where I belong now and

Hereafter but you you died an unnatural

death like daughter mer you're only here

till you're not what do you mean it

means there is a path back to the mortal

world for you like for sure well no

nothing's for sure well but there is for

instance I knew powerful spells that

could bring one back from the afterlife

to the mortal world

if I felt that they had purposed there

and had reason to return it was not

beyond my means I bet I know someone who

could do that too I bet you do

well do you think it's it's it's right

to go back once you've been here like

isn't here where you're supposed to be

here we'll always be here

that's true oh it's waiting for you my

dear do you think that while I'm here I

could maybe see Lysander do you think I

could like just like say hi real quick

do you think you're not looking at him

now yeah the light on your face the

grass under your feet the song in the

air yeah yes I just when I saw him

before he's a really handsome blond guy

holding a baby and I just thought maybe

he looked like that again but I totally

see what you mean now and you do feel

the Sun on you and you do feel that the

sunlight here is infinitely deeper and

has has a sublimity to it that you just

can't find in the real world like you do

feel like Lysander is touching you with

his light here whereas before you could

say those words but it was hard to be

hard to believe here it is absolutely

true she says to you first she says

daughter man why don't you go and play

with the other children and he does he

goes off a swing he goes and he turn he

gets but but ten feet down the hill then

he turns back to you and waves he that

says bye I'll tell you dad joke when you

come back I had a friend that taught me

some I think and then the wrestler tells

you in confidence I think he'll be going

back to the

soon you think so yes it'd be such a

shame if he didn't water what a sweet

little boy you asked questions about

whether you belong here

I wouldn't dwell on such things why not

you should you're young you should live

in the moment I have read a lot of

scriptures that say that I guess

sometimes I just forget she says I'm

going to share with you something that

I've learned but first I wish I had

something to write it down but first I

have a question for you is there is

there anything is there any reason for

you to return well I mean my only reason

for existing is to serve the morning

Lord of course so if he maybe thought

that I could continue serving him by

protecting the people that I was with

like I was before I'd sure be happy to

do that why should it be his decision

well cuz he's the morning Lord so she's

like looking around like this is

sacrilege like I mean isn't that isn't

that the point of being a paladin of

Lysander that you you give your life

over to his service and you're you're

his what justly appointed bondslave no I

don't think so I think that as the light

he will sometimes help you light a path

if you don't know which way to go

but beyond that why would he make that

decision for you doesn't he trust you of

course he does

huh you think while they enter trust me

have you given him reason not to I don't

think so

well there you are but but how do you

know what to do if you don't just do

whatever Lysander wants Wow you try

things you make choices and sometimes

they're wrong oh I've done that I'm sure

you have as have I probably more often

than you

well you've given me something to think

about that's for sure well at the risk

of giving you too much to think about

consider this

the greatest gift is not the soul

the greatest gift is not the sole no

what is the greatest gift she looks

around

I thought you say laughs I love him what

do you think mom I like that mm-hmm

and she says I thought what a waste is a

soul that can't experience love what is

a soul without a soul mate

well if that's case I've got a hole what

a rather lonely one well that's the case

I sure have a lot of love and left to do

I love you I loved or tumor I love

people back where we came from very much

and I bet I bet Lysander wants me to

keep on loving them as hard as I can as

long as I can what do you want am I

supposed to want things it's it's all

new for me I'm trying real hard to learn

how to want things to get the morning

Lord for the moment and ask yourself

what do you want he's going to love you

and be happy with you whatever you

decide he'll probably be happiest if you

decide for yourself

I've always kind of wanted a puppy

that's one thing I know I want is that

what you mean like a gift sure a puppy

or did you mean like more like a like a

like a want like a grander like I don't

know yeah it's your life yeah I feel

like I've disappointed you I don't know

I disappointed me no look what you've

done look what you've done you got us

here whatever where would I be if you

were not there to save us all I would be

nowhere well you're safe

ever since I was like I'd be what you

know a little kid and then I just said I

was sent to the you know to learn how to

be Paladin and I learned all about

thandor and I learned what I was

supposed to do and then I got really

good at doing that and I know have know

what I'm supposed to want but now all of

a sudden I'm supposed to want what I

want and it's just a very big thing to

learn how to do and I don't know cuz the

things that I wanted got in the way of

the things that I should want and then I

thought maybe I shouldn't want those

things anymore so I was trying not to

want them but now you're saying I should

maybe want them but then what if that

makes the things I don't want to happen

happen because of what I want being what

I don't want maybe you should do

overthink it oh okay consider this the

morning lord likes certain things

goodness

birth the light

if you believe in those same things then

you have already done enough for him

take what you feel is important to you

and what you feel is important to him

and make them both part of who you are I

see what you're saying don't lean too

far into your belief in him at the

expense of leaning into your belief in

yourself so maybe maybe it's not

necessarily such a bad thing that I've

always kind of dreamed of maybe being

like my mom and dad and finding someone

to share my life with and be my life

mate maybe that's not so bad not so bad

to me she says another way to look at it

is you have two legs one of them you

step forth to the betterment of the

morning Lord and one of them you step

forth to the betterment of yourself and

you have many more steps in your idea

big towering steps

okay two legs one head

I was even knew her her head was right

now smash cut the evil ins hair smash

cut to evil ins heads bouncing sort of

like a bauble or ornament off the side

of waffles galumphing body as she pulls

up the rear as it were waiting

expectantly to see where deaath paltin

and Strix go next the three of you are

peering around a darkened hallway

you heard the the death shape cackle off

into the darkness what do you want to do

next turn to palton and i'll say how

would you feel about taking down the one

responsible for all of this

remember the soul monger that's created

by a sara rack right death that I think

that was him that that oh all right

yeah and charging ahead Strix you've got

the light so you're trying to keep up

yeah as soon as two years it's a CEREC

she's just like wait no I we haven't

even rested a full time we can't just

let him get away

I don't fight back we don't need magic

we're gonna we're gonna talk to this

fella Matt your magics great it just it

was it was you know like nah there's a

time in place she has no hope she's like

it's like the shadow fellow like has

started affecting her again but really

just like

right she just looks like so sad and

crestfallen from just evil and dying and

no one liking imagine as you around the

corner you see now I should mention that

this new hallway in which you find

yourself

unlike the entrance hall which sort of

had this weird kind of hexagonal shape

this is more like a rectangular or

square corridor about ten feet by ten

feet or so just carved out of the stone

and as you make your way around the

corner and you peer to where he has gone

you can see him just ahead of you and

there's another corner with another left

turn

so left turn left turn and he stops as

he notices as he hears you guys chasing

after him and he's standing at the next

corner about fifty feet away from you

he's leading us and now you can all see

in the darkness or in the in the green

light from the lantern that he looks

like death he's a skeletal figure in a

black torn tattered Grob pawns like

charging him on God fit in until he sees

a he's like right into a trap or

something so I'm just gonna lay my face

in a waffles okay yeah you bury your

face into her softer okay and then oh

sorry Paul's just like well at least

we're being led somewhere and we're not

just like being idle cuz I don't know

where we're going wait hold on hey if

he's here

did we does that mean we're not in the

shadow fell did we make it back I guess

we keep following him we don't have

anything else okay as you strict's

advances toward him he goes around the

next corner bolts away from you and you

round the next corner and it's just like

the same thing he's about 50 feet away

at another corner going left by this

time

just based on your own sense of the

geometry you're kind of doing a square

and starting to loop back around the

heck this guy sucks yeah I like this

circle garbage I have an idea

okay I'm gonna whisper it so that he

doesn't hear because I feel like he

might like he might like being a troll

so okay two of us will well it waffles

and I will stay here both you d f you up

Alton follow him and then when he gets

back here I'll just try to polymorph him

this is an actual circle right as far as

we can tell Paul just say well a

ridiculous plan is better than no plan

let's go I can also set a tripwire

I like the trip wire edge wall I don't

know how to do that you're gonna you can

do that

that's better ously a trap like that who

knows maybe he can he disappear the

prime or front worker might resist it or

something I'm gonna actually use if I

could I want to cast miss I want to try

and like go back a corner so he doesn't

actually see me okay and I want to cast

mislead okay and I want my mislead copy

to keep chasing him and then I will

actually just stay put okay but before I

do I'm gonna tell him be like like guys

just don't move no like they just see me

walk off yeah wait you can do that yeah

yeah he becomes invisible at the same

time a double of him appears where he's

standing so it looks like there's no

change at all you just see him start to

walk around they don't know magic

anymore yes sir I don't even know him

just like just stay here okay thank you

that he keeps going I mean I propellant

now that paltin doesn't have a I guess

he could have an illusory light source

so yeah he he does seem to have a light

source with him as he goes

I can handle okay and the rest of you

aren't just gonna wait to see just let

paltin go on his own just watch

kind of watch the corner to see if we

end up like making like a full loop or

something okay and paltin can you see

through your doubles question you can

see through its eyes and hear through

its ears as if you were there that's all

I didn't even know that that's all a

grad that's don't alright so as you

follow this black clouds Specter around

he leads you all the way back to the

entrance tunnel and then he makes a

beeline out like he's running out of

this place and like how far was how long

did that take to from where I cast that

to like back to the entrance so that

would be about eighty feet okay so

palton just like instantly just appears

back where he was standing he's like

he's making a break for it we gotta go

and just like guns it in the path kind

of yeah yeah yeah all right let's move

all right

you galumph with waffles and make your

way back toward the entrance rounding a

corner then as you get back to the

entrance tunnel you can see that this

death is standing at the farm mouth of

the tunnel basically that the beach and

the water and they've ruined ships

behind him and he turns and stops there

as you all pile into the tunnel behind

him and he says I am free

excuse me no you're not yep just not

free okay no I'm very confident in it

like I know something that would be a

dirty 20 he's like he sort of looks

around he kind of looks over his

shoulder at the beach and the ruined

ships and and the the cold air of

freedom blowing his robes around and

then he says no I do appear to be but he

says but he stops and says what do you

mean I'm not well just like you fell for

the illusion of freedom but you are not

where you think he turns around kind of

alarmed and looks he says it looks real

to me that's the point fool what have

you done yeah yeah what's back at strick

starting all this and just gives you one

of these faces is that the polymorph em

face no that's like I guess we're going

with it there's an owl bear here waffles

do something funny oh jeez hmm you

should you like the dancing bear yeah

yeah she'll just sort of rear up on her

hind legs and feel a little sort of

pirouette that makes no sense

the skeleton just sort of tips his head

as he looks at that furry behemoth

behind you doing that little pirouette

Alton's just like and you can see the

skeleton starts to cast a spell Oh No

do you determine what it is first and I

try to make eyes at pulse and like be

ready to also cast one of those mm-hmm

I'm ready all right um counter SPO if

the creature is casting a third-level

smaller lower the spell fails the spell

fails no no under your spell works I'm

sorry no there's no counter spell you

failed his spell so his little thing

goes pop pop pop and nothing happens

snick okay Paul Dan's then just like you

thought that you led us into a trap but

we're seven steps ahead of you and you

fell into our counter trap when you when

you when you led us in here and we faced

all the trials we did even our party

members dying that was all part of the

plan

[Music]

and he's like whose plan I don't even

know you

I just like me already haven't like what

have you got against me the death curse

right dad curse I'm really confused I

thought this would write itself

No Sarek No are you are you not deaf

he says I have death like literal death

like you take people who are living when

they are not living anymore

what are you doing here I was trapped in

here a prisoner of the bow hand off we

scared us we freed you it was us

you're welcome thank you yes but not

entirely because again you are not free

at the moment release me I what to do I

want to condition Wow what wait what's

the condition all the souls is still

Paul has also been holding his hands up

like he's actually doing something

death will say all the souls that you

would claim all the ones that you would

take to the afterlife to bring to rest

all the ones that you would take have

been being stolen from you taking by the

death to it unborn God not only to be

free you we ourselves to take care of

that God too much exposition goodness

can you help us get it all out of here

we need to leave the shadow fell valley

to be free you but if you can help free

us from the shadow fell why would you

want to leave all this it's not really

our color oh vacation we're gonna come

back he says you're looking for a shadow

cross a

yes strikes like holds up the little

Raven foot and she's like led us to

death

see actual the actual death and he says

well that's remarkably easy is that home

no it is not

we'll need one more thing from you you

take those and you bring death but can

you unring death can you can you undo a

death can you deed if I do that because

you want you to freedom out of here I

offer the ultimate freedom if you want

to stay here then that's fine

no no Strix will peek behind Pauly be

like are you a fan of the dust men wait

and love their music don't decide track

I'm working on it there is there's

someone who was just taken didn't say it

was you it wasn't okay cool was it you

wasn't saying it was you but I'm saying

no one fingers yeah exactly I mean I am

but this is because of the curse that is

on you in which has you introduce that

wife

I can't kill everybody right okay yeah

that is a bit okay what I'm saying is

can you undo a death regardless of if

you were responsible for said death like

I'm some sort of anti death resurrection

I'm getting tired gonna switch right now

I am NOT called life do I look like a

liar to you you look like you know magic

do you have a scroll or something or

somewhere we can buy a scroll maybe if

you let us out in a shadow across his

shoulders just don't even get a little

slack and he just sort of looks down

himself and kind of looks back up to you

do I need a scythe to paint you a

picture what help actually we wouldn't

have gotten you confused with all the

other undead things evil dead things

that are after us

I can't bring anybody back to life so

what are you let us out at a shop that's

somewhere where we can buy a scroll to

bring our friend back to life that would

be grand

thank you barmy death person or if you

happen to know where a one mr. phox

resides that would also be acceptable

getting real specific with these demands

right now death yeah but yeah it's not

like I was like okay can we also like

GPS this I was just like or make

someone not die is what we want a shadow

crossing please shadow crossing no you

see him sort of look over it he sort of

looks over the edge and kind of looks

down and says I'm just like well I can

send you back to your happy little place

away from the shadow of hell

great do we have your word

yes can do I took oh yeah do I feel like

he's lying you can make an inside check

today I sure as heck am mmm not good

17 hard to get a ring ID on the death

visit you know hard to betray emotions

when you don't have a face

I got a 19 because I got really close

I'm trying to seal his robe yeah creep

up there like colic crawling across the

floor like a cockroach until you really

want to be something to pull out your

knight scissors and just mm-hm

take a corner off his robe and yeah just

like whatever

so before I like like undo the spell I

want I'm gonna do a little intimidation

okay I'll have you know that this is an

even extent of my power and if you are

lying to us we'll be back and it'll be

far worse than any imprisonment you've

ever experienced and I will I will just

us think so that is for the 15 okay he

says yes yes yeah whatever you like that

all sounds good to me

okay yeah I feel like we're just

harassing an old man yeah I'm just

trying to make sure we get as you're as

you sort of snipped a piece of his robe

start to crawl away you see that on his

person he doesn't have much he literally

is a skeleton clad in a tattered robe

but you do see sort of fastened or or in

what is kind of like a loop on the

inside of his torn robe is a pair of

scroll tubes that seem to be bound

together

with some sort of piece of cloth or

something and there are

inscriptions on the tubes it looks like

an ancient ancient receptacle that he's

been carrying around with him oh do it

steal from death I want you to your

camera froze reciter what you said no

sticks is just like what's that and

point the third tube says that's my

naughty and nice list oh I don't want

that thing I already know now told in

here that is just like tempting before I

kill myself why don't we get this over

with

yes please let's do it

I'm sorry I can send you across with a

touch or I can send you back to where

the crossing actually is yeah I really

don't want you touching us that sound

that that where where the crossing on us

that sounds okay right yeah we returned

to the crossing the reasons go back

exactly where we were back to dragon

bait back to everything else that's

breeding for us yeah let's do that

yes please don't touch us and your spell

palton ended just like very well there

was no magic yes there was

[Laughter]

no there wasn't yes there was no yeah

wasn't the magics so powerful that it

seems real no no no no no you let me

finish no this was a lie a deception are

you going back on your word then no us

freeing you was not a deception I am too

old for this

same-same he says so you're sure you

want to go through the other way fine go

back break through the inner wall okay

rich rich inner wall see that wall

behind you yeah breathe through it

done I got it we got it all the way

around once okay you have any advice

before we leave death just really tired

like I don't know I don't smoke or

something no don't die just pray you

don't meet another of my kind again why

are you the nice one this was an

accidental meeting guys time you see one

of us it won't be unless you find

someone else like me who has been

trapped somehow in which case I guess in

that particular case it will be another

accidental meeting with death noted

right hey thank you

alright we're done here let's go marine

please don't come sooner because we're

annoying and I walk away and you're here

I'm go ahead

all right what are you gonna do make

your way just around yeah well do that

okay yeah you get halfway around when a

trapdoor opens onto your feet literally

about 20 feet ahead of where you guys

stopped previously and you can all make

dexterity saving throws okay so this is

a trap though this is a trap though

great the waste of my dungeon doubler

feet I have advantage versus traps

outstanding I have an 18 Ruby Wow

I got a 300 18 really quick like before

this like as we were walking away as

depth like rounds of quorum just like

just like trying to fathom what just

happened

walking along do you hear like you hear

this and they're like you're Scoobies

reflexes come into play you leap right

off the off the pit and palton actually

sort of teeters a bit and then nimbly

leaps to the side what happens is as

you're walking along the floor it's

slant it drops out underfoot and sort of

drops at a slant so that you cease

tricks hit the slant and then slide off

to the side down a chute

she just promptly disappears from view

into the darkness taking the lantern

with her save yourselves so the light

the green light disappears with strix

down the chute Strix almost immediately

you pop out of the chute and you're kind

of in a free-for-all free fall I should

say falling down a shaft of some kind

so the shape kind of spills into a shaft

broom turn my lantern into a broom

really quick that would be an action so

know if you have a reaction and you can

do that feather fall spell or something

I know I'm just falling okay we

after about 20 feet all right you hit

something soft and mushy and something

sticks in your eye but it's kind of also

kind of soft and mushy oh and then

you'll begin to sink down into this and

as the light shines around you see you

have fallen into a pit of rotting

corpses oh well I I'm used to that

so I'm not fazed at all No so all these

sort of horrible rotting things and the

stench is overpowering India and paltin

you suddenly the waft of the stench

comes oh shoot this is like there's a

bunch of debtors in here I'll be fine I

was just like look if it startled you

and you farted you don't have to hide it

from us tricks can you get out I think

so

I turned my lantern into a broom now

okay and I will shake all the corpse

bits off of me so I think about keeping

one of something and then I'm just like

you know what no I already got part of

death sorrow what's odd about this

tricks and you realize it right away is

these all appear to be fresh which is

strange given that this place is sort of

kind of locked up and desolated like

there's nothing around here

you don't know where these bodies come

from it is at that moment when suddenly

something falls from the ceiling and

lens right next to you with a splat well

there's to be a fresh corpse ah and then

sort of sink into the mass you're not

sure hmm oh it's possible that you fell

out of the chute and down like and

there's something higher up and in fact

when you look up with your dark vision

you can see the shaft goes up higher

than where you spilled out of all right

this this might be a way out I'm gonna

check it out just don't move so I'll get

on my broom what actually no yeah I'll

get on my broom and just kind of like

fly up the shaft to see if I can see

anything

you do see about 20 feet higher than

where you came out of there is just roof

comes to a dead end there's no

indication of where the body fell from

huh huh sir I do in our Conner Shack

baybee doesn't think why this would be

happening at this point in time the

trapdoor oh no come on resets it so find

the switch again I got an 18 your best

guess is there is some residual magical

energy up here like maybe there's a gate

that opens periodically that spills

these things out got it

or or you know some creature has the

ability to basically teleport corpses to

this place and this is where they fall

and decompose right I'm thinking it

might since death led us here maybe it's

a shadow crossing of some sort it could

be um all right then

didn't know that shadow crossing these

places of a high concentration of death

that is true as you scream at down this

 you can't hear them at all anymore

Paulie because we it totally contained

within the shaft there's no exit okay um

I'm just gonna wait here for a second

and just see if I can see what happens

when the corpse falls through okay you

don't have to wait very long maybe about

20 seconds or so when they're when a

corpse literally just sort of falls out

of the ceiling all right in that moment

the ceiling kind of takes on almost in

substantial quality okay that's it

that's it that's the shadow crossing all

right I'll zoom back down and back up

and see that the door is closed on me

and you start hearing scratching and

panic going trying to find the same

pressure plate or trigger or whatever it

was that opened up the trap door and

just press that again okay yeah you can

basically trip the trap again giving you

given your unique skills you can do it

without putting yourself in any jeopardy

good and when it opens the ramp is there

you see waffles kind of look at it and

I don't know how we're gonna get waffles

I'm sorry

Oh polymorph that's how we're gonna do

it okay we did listen girl up there

listen here's what we have to do number

one I need more spells we don't have

enough but there's a shadow crossing and

as long as we can rest and I can do my

magic again I can polymorph everyone all

of you and waffles into bats or birds or

something we need to fly through the

ceiling down there uh Chris would I be

able to levitate things that cannot fly

that's right halten I'm sorry I always

forget that you know magic I'm a little

bit not it's not much

one creature or object of your choice so

yes now you can only do one at a time

that's the tricky part with that it's

like does that work if we just want a

time it does that not work no that does

where you can fly

can levitate D if you're just the only

one who's gonna have to be polymorphed

if you're fine with that is there any

way we can make this easier like from

where you were down the shaft you think

you could kind of point in the general

direction of where that was yeah you

could probably climb it

um I'm thinking more of a direct path

I'm confused

I'd say I'm trying to say I'm gonna take

this whole frickin wall down oh yeah yes

I think so yeah otherwise if that's too

tough we can try going back to the wall

that def pointed out earlier and just

knocked that one down well I I could see

the shadow cross hey it's right there it

might be filled with corpses but it's

not a bad sign all right yeah I'm gonna

try to use the horn of blasting to make

them more I guess easier entrance or

whatever - like this shaft right and

have me like slide down and go however I

love out the wall

I'm fine you yeah because then I might

just be able to climb out of it or

something right so using Strix as

guidance to point me in the general

direction to to make your percentage

roll for I'm scared okay twenty-one oh

okay all right you were one point away

from that thing blowing up in your face

probably taking a face with it yes yeah

the 20% chance of blowing up avoided

narrowly all right horn blasts the wall

breaks and falls downward leaving a

gaping hole in this in the top part of

the shaft and thus you're you can see as

soon as the hole is made yet that you're

actually pretty close to the shaft

ceiling at that point oh great

evylyn yes you're in a far more well lit

place

yes aris was like kind of wrapping up

the conversation but I think even has

been like you know she's in heaven so

she was a little bit starstruck and

she's like not really realizing what had

happened but I think she's having this

conversation about like what she wants

and she was talking about these people

she was protecting it occurs to her that

when she last saw her friends they were

like wrapped in tentacles and about to

be eaten by a giant right yes scary

monster yeah so she's like um the rest

just real quick uh when when you ask

what I want is that like just like a

theoretical type of question or is it

like do I have any kind of choice up

here as to potentially going back or do

I just kind of wait well you're going to

need some buddy to bring you back I

can't like send help

or like petition anyone to help cuz I

kind of left some people I kind of care

about now I want to help in harm's way

she says that it that would be that

would be a first

well why not I don't know I'll take it

alright you're just gonna stand there

yep let's make it happen I mean I've

done a lot of things for the first time

lately

so you wouldn't see his arrest kind of

looking around to see if anything

miraculous is about to happen because

you know heaven knows nothing seems to

be changing the kids down at the bottom

of the hill seemed having a grand old

time door timer is springing up over

rocks and there are some other kids

chasing after him nothing seems to be

happening other than the beautiful

spring breeze comes blowing in and some

butterflies flipped around in the air

around you and they're the most

beautiful colourful butterflies you've

ever seen even ones like oh I mean I'm

I'm paying attention to my mission they

start telling you a song

so there's nothing I can do but wait I'm

new here too and but at that point I'm

suddenly there's a shadow that sort of

falls over all of you and it's it flies

over you like a dragon shadow almost

something with wings and you look up

into the Sun you look around to see

where it is oh it's behind the tree but

you hear the flapping of its wings Alice

the tree and comes into view beautifully

lit by the light you see it as morning

glory

a full glorious set of golden wings

and she does this sort of little circle

and then she comes down with a Klopp

Klopp Klopp Klopp her wings sort of fold

up behind her and she comes over to you

and just sort of boughs her head the

rest this is another thing that I wanted

I didn't know particularly that it was

the thing I wanted but I did want it and

now it's happened and it's a thing I

want it look at my beautiful Pegasus

steed isn't she amazing I say amazing is

a perfect word for what she is

I'm just noting her you just never seen

anything quite like it

am I wearing my flying boots mm-hmm yes

they are a part of you in a way okay so

yeah I'd say in this case absolutely

you're probably not like you probably

not brandishing any weapons but they are

sort of part of evil then I imagine that

I'm in like a really pretty sundress

with these boots here you go all right

guys wanna look at the Sun dress a

little bit in there yeah uh I'm like

morning Li you want to race let's go

zooms around all right as you zoom

around in the air flying her around

heaven you can see that the children

down below have all stopped to play and

they're staring up at you and door demur

especially door Naru you want a ride yes

please she lets the kids take turns

riding morning glory as you take Dora

Maar up he tells you that his family is

horse breeders and horse trainers and

they sell horses and the last thing he

remembers before he ended up in that

terrible place with the tower was

falling off a horse place of the tower

where you first met him oh right oh I

see well probably your parents loved you

very much

and

they probably took real good care of you

and hopefully you'll see them again real

soon he says he doesn't know his parents

particularly well he knows his teachers

better

Oh what kind of teachers well a

horse-riding teacher who he doesn't like

so much anymore and no seriously he says

his music teacher his languages teacher

[Music]

and his history studies teacher you get

the impression just talking to this get

this kid lived a very privileged life I

know what it's like to be sent away from

your family and just be at school all

the time do you like it yeah yeah much

bond with my family oh that's good

your family's not so great there they're

always so busy hmm well you know what

family's not just about who you're born

to it's about who you love hmm

that's nice I hadn't thought of that

that's what I learned I love my horse

he's my daily okay I miss man that's

good this is a nice horse I like eggs

yes they're pretty aren't they this is a

Pegasus I guess so it's not a Hippogriff

because hippogriffs have beaks uh-huh

it's not a Griffin because Griffins have

beaks too

she was a horse now she has wings which

I think makes her a Pegasus but she was

always kind of a you know God horse kind

of thing hey Griffin

why cuz they eat horses oh well

that's fair but you know and she just

like launches she's just like chatting

up these kids does does the rest seem to

have anything more to say no she's way

the hell down there now she left no

she's still down there but she's up here

so I'm on the horse yeah oh we're flying

around yeah okay you're up in the clouds

let's see how high we can go okay you go

pretty darn high you just keep on going

I just sort of do a little spiral up in

the air as high as you can go

what does it look like from up here you

can see you as you break the clouds you

can see the tops of mountains beautiful

in some cases what looked like palaces

on their slopes are on their peaks and

the sunshine here is radiant you can

also see creatures flying around those

palaces that you've never seen before

they look humanoid but they have great

feathered wings I want to go meet one of

those people Jordan where should we go

me one of those people

he's like touching onto this okay does

any is it any of this recognisable to me

like should I make a religion check you

don't need to make a religion check all

you recognize is you saw like frescoes

and murals in the spires of the morning

and in other great temples that showed

like the mountains of Mount Celestia and

also the heavenly architecture this

seems like that but the the artists of

the world you came from could not

possibly capture its genuine grandeur

it's like more color than they have down

there kind of yeah there are colors

there that just don't exist in the real

world they manifest on these golden

structures and on these mountaintops but

more than that there's just a sense of

timelessness that seems to pervade this

place that you can't render in any

scatcherd stained-glass window even's

kind of warring between like she's just

in her this is like pure glee for her

this is everything she's ever dreamed of

and she just wants to go play and touch

everything and meet everybody but then

she also has this idea of like needing

to get back to her friends as fast as

she can yeah

so I don't know she's gonna go talk to

one of those people flying around okay

the rest of you in the shaft it's very

very dark here it smells like a it's

nauseatingly sickeningly gross sure evil

and wants to come back so with this new

passageway made to where this shadow

crossing is yeah how how difficult would

it be to get all of us up and through it

now it feels like a solid ceiling now we

have to wait for the bodies to come Oh

once they throw the debtor's through

they land and the other pile of debtor's

which I'm covered in now hope that's not

a problem with anyone then how long do

we have to go through not long I haven't

counted it because I'm not that smart it

was very fast it was fast so not long oh

okay so I'm saying if there's any we it

would be easier if we could polymorph

everyone and everyone could just like be

mice or something on my robe and then I

can fly through and it's fast okay

that's that's probably the best shot we

have at this and that will also make

sure that waffles and Simon and evylyn

get through to it shed its I think okay

it would just polymorph what did they be

tiny on them or just make the armor tiny

I don't know I'm not sure we might have

to carry the armor only polymorph it

like takes the entire person in being in

like

Strix is like like doing that math

Ladyface i don't maybe we could try but

we'll need all right

fine we'll just do it okay but we'll

need to give you a moment to rest and

get your spells back right yeah I don't

think I have enough to polymorph

everyone right now just wait for a

moment

all right you can do that so you'd like

to take a long rest to get your spell

slots back is that what you're saying

yes okay and do you want to do that here

in this pit of decaying corpses no I

mean on the ground asleep it's a life

choice I would like to go I think some

of Mel's nicer be easier to actually

rest we know we know where it is yes

yeah I was gonna say we know where it is

so if we go back up we can just go chill

on a hut yeah okay great yeah you you

hit the hut and you hang out there until

Strix I can recharge all her spells and

turn you all the damn ice yes oh my gosh

you guys gonna hang out with juniper all

right now the way up I only actually

specified by making sure we have all the

evil in equipment as well sure all gonna

make sense weapons and yep yeah oh okay

you have all of evil

yep and it's all sort of strapped or

lashed to waffles or what-have-you

yes very securely when you know

polymorph somebody who has all that

stuff that stuff is gonna get absorbed

into their form so you have to worry

about okay cool Strix figures that out

at night and the math lady face goes

away

[Laughter]

evylyn you not get close enough to one

of these figures to realize it is an

angelic being you can see it has sort of

he has golden skin radiantly beautiful

eyes like pools of

molten gold and he's thinly dressed but

he does carry a sword and he's got great

huge wings daughter VAR have you ever

seen anyone like that before

door tumor is just paralyzed I need a

beautiful you can see that his sword is

not actually on his person it's just

sort of flying alongside him sort of so

cool dormer isn't that you can also see

above him is what appears to be not

attached to him but flying above him is

a bow with arrows as well as like all

his weapons are just at the ready but

not attached to his body well he he does

take notice of you and he does give you

sort of a salute hi my name is Eva and

I'm new here what's your name he says to

Marius very pleased to meet you too

Marius uh I just got here I'm just

learning my way around what what do you

do i guard against evil ah me too I love

guarding against evil we have so much in

common he says is there anything I can

do for you uh well probably a few things

I mean I need to learn my way around

here and oh maybe trying to see if there

might be any way I could help some

people that I left back you know down

there make a table set in make an inside

check 24 you can tell as you're talking

to him that it's not at first you think

oh he's bored he doesn't he's not

listening to me because he's not really

paying attention to you but then you

realize he is actually very very

vigilant and you suddenly realize you

being here is actually kind of

distracting him from what he considers

to be his supreme duty uh then that is

to watch for any sign of evil intrusion

and this

of this this individual does not he is

not the type you instantly tell who will

drop his guard for an instant oh I'm so

sorry I tend to talk a lot when I'm

excited to meet someone so I know I'm

distracting you but no it's fun okay um

well is there anyone like that I should

meet around here you can meet whoever

you want well I mean like is there

anyone like in charge itself and around

you or you know yeah I had breakfast

with him early not good he's off doing

important god stuff I think but fret not

I'm sure he'll make time for you okay

well thanks that's not that's not why

you really came here though right no no

you're not looking to be maybe brought

back from the dead that's kind of what I

look for yeah you're very perceptive

thank you um yeah it's not the first

time just so you know you're a spirit

you have no body and since there's no

body here there's nothing to resurrect

yeah I kind of lost my body you come

yeah you kind of did but that's okay

because if somebody does want to bring

you back they can and actually I can

resurrect people but I do need a body

which is why I typically only use it

when I'm brought to the world or

whichever world from which you came and

other worlds like yours I have been able

to resurrect people but there has always

been a body hmm and it'd be kind of hard

to find a body up here I'd imagine yeah

yeah you know not too many bodies up

here well one time my friends shared a

body for a little while when one of them

was dead I know that was cool yeah I

remember you know about that right not

to get too long and into things but

a lot of information about people who

belong here comes my way security

reasons really are you like the head of

security no but one day ah oh I bet you

will be so you know stuff about my life

a little bit do you know ever do you

know what do you know well I know you

come from a very reliable order

dedicated they're having a little bit of

problems right now they could probably

use a little straightening out if you

don't mind my saying my order

I'm afraid so yeah ah we got an eye on

him just to make sure you know nothing

goes pear-shaped she's very distraught

about this hmm

yeah but you you are an exemplar yeah no

question and what you've done I've heard

mumbling as of sainthood do you have a

lot of fans oh I think you guys have me

mistaken for somebody else I don't know

I haven't done much at all in fact one

time we thought I'd hate a baby it was

just very disturbing and I can't and you

didn't need a baby oh so glad you

confirm that Dora Maar says can we go

back now just a second well so what

would you recommend I do if I want to

help so you know my friends you know

that they're in trouble you know that

they the thing that ate me was trying to

eat them too and I'm just real worried

that if I don't get back real soon that

they might be in danger and I can't help

I suggest you relax and enjoy your stay

here until maybe they can find a way to

bring you back are they okay right now

answer hazy ask again later they're kind

of an adult they're kind of in a dark

place right now or so but they're all

alive yes

they're all alive they're doing great oh

well I know you wouldn't lie to me so

that's that's good to know

okay well the big one says hi yeah

waffles

sure okay oh I got it - so okay all

right well enjoy your flight okay

nice tie cake Jordan right back down see

you around okay that's nice to meet you

wink wink wink wink

yeah what was his name again tart

tameria's - Marius yeah - Marius okay I

go back down I take dor de Mer down okay

yeah that was very overwhelming for door

- mer I pat him on the little head all

right yeah so when you sit down on the

ground back in the field where the other

kids are they all want their turn and so

you basically spend a good deal amount

of time basically giving flight lessons

to a bunch of kids who never in life had

a chance to ever fly a winged horse

before she takes what tameria's said to

heart and starts to really enjoy hanging

out with all these kids and just like

giving them the best time ever

super fulfilling for her so she's just

like every kid she had like oh and what

was your doggie like all his name was

Bob Bob is a good name for a doggie you

know just like very interested in every

single child yeah and they've all got

they've all got their own stories to

tell and they tell you about their

families and you know what they remember

and all that kind of stuff and they're

all very very well-behaved polite

they're utterly fascinated with you and

you totally get into it it becomes this

sort of in this moment this kind of

all-consuming purpose that you have and

you sort of kind of forget a little

about

your friends back in back in the waffle

hut keeps out a lot of things but smell

not one of them damn it I mean the Strix

is in there usually anyway fair enough

highlight some insect repellent Paul

that's a better smell yes yes actually I

did all the time mister smell so bad you

light a few of those soon yeah it pretty

much covers up the dead smell for the

most part you're able to take a long

rest will you get your spells back Strix

yes you cast your polymorphs yes

everyone is going to be mice alright

you now have a passel of mice all right

I'm like comfy and I may put them in my

hat and like and juniper is like I'm in

charge now

[Laughter]

[Laughter]

alright so I will hover on my broom and

just wait until that portal opens and

all zoom through as fast as I can

okay me sideways not where the bodies

will fall got it Arkana check for me

sixteen okay you emerge out of a

cauldron falls in what looks to be like

I don't know some sort of interior of a

mausoleum or something

all right and as you look around in this

in dark interior space with your dark

vision you see that it is arrayed very

much like a hags workroom you just hear

like you know these rats you this like

you hear like definite strict danger

noises alright and your noises seem to

attract attention

god damnit why was I so scared from out

of the dark corners

this mausoleum workshop you see Figures

begin to step out of the shadows their

skin a midnight bluish black their hair

a mass tangle their horns coming their

bluish horns coming off of their their

dark-skinned heads kind of giving them

sort of like a tiefling s quality but

their eyes burning red oh how many would

you say there are there are three like

you guys like sticking out of her hat

just like your little mouse faces

looking at this now with your Arcana

with your account of roles tricks you're

able to ascertain that these are night

hags do it even looks a familiar little

mice heads poke out and look out yeah

they they look very familiar they may

have ridden you and that's where we'll

stop no squeakers squeak squeak all
