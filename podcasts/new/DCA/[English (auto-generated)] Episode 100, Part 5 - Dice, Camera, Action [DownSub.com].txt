oh boy we could not be more excited to

inaugurate the first-ever DMO Gorgon

finale we're gonna murder everybody but

this is the thing it's like they say oh

I don't want to be murdered Oh Nami

right right but but but but writings we

have ratings and also look it won't

every person who dies will only increase

the comfort for those who remain in the

so that confirms it if you do die in the

game you die in real life yes oh no

you'll be fine we'll just kick you out

and the room will get cooler that's

right no just room that heat all right

are you a bomb ishutin

let's go this is that's right mm to hold

the Emery's that's right right where'd

that little dump word BB M daring them

that's right to survive by diem daddy

all right so evylyn palton walnut and

dinar you are standing outside of the

drama in court here the moistened drawn

in court the vessel that was once of a

deer is lying dead in front surrounded

by you the coach that you paltin and you

evil in are sitting on begins to dis

coorporate and turn to mist and you just

sort of both of you fall through it and

hit the ground except I don't because I

well you probably don't even have time

to activate your boots before you land

on your buttocks fine with a Clank nice

and then dinar and Walton walnut you see

who's the bigger douche you guys see all

of the townsfolk of red larch just

started melting away like candles in a

blowtorch do we have any insight as to

whether we think this is like they were

projections or like actually all the

townspeople are dying unclear because as

they melt away it's like the scene from

Raiders of Lost Ark where you see like

the blood yeah and as they just sort of

melt into piles of fleshy slag on the

ground listen I have a line you know you

you see a woman come out of the Mist and

she unlike the rest of you who are sort

of had all the color washed away from

you is brightly dressed and she makes

her way over to the dead man on the

ground who are you and she she says Issa

and she kneels down beside the man and

just sort of touches her hand to his

dead heart and says this was not on time

my love but our time will come around

again I have foreseen it

at this point van ricktum who still got

his sword out of his cane is circling

around behind her and she just holds up

a hand finger up and says now's not the

time Rudolph

I'm just I'm saying that I don't want to

provoke her because she's clearly with

this guy that just caused us a lot of

problems so I'm just waiting to see what

she does I'm gonna I'll approach her and

be like I just want you to know it was

all of these - I tried to help so bad I

believe in love you're a good man Alton

thank you I don't know dinars

high on the thrill of victory having

killed the boss in one stroke yeah and

me madam there's Riven away it is Sonic

henchmen go away hmm

wait double down like Oh your ass friend

- all right you know this

yeah oh all right I'm two for two ready

go three for three

so walnut haven't returned back to

herself I prefer you for me um we'll say

on the off chance do you know how we get

out of here I can take you from here can

I have a cart - we're out of here I like

it

donar like and I am like sword ready

this is not the place you want to be

right now I agree with that he stands up

and says come with me if you want to

live I look at ya evylyn visibly shook

she just you know came back from the

domain of dread he doesn't really know

why she went there or how she came back

all just consoling just just all the

support she's kind of trying like

obviously something is still going

around her so she's trying not to be the

center of attention but she's like you

just asked him real nice and you just

brought me back TLDR yeah thanks yeah

don't mention it I'm glad you're back

could you ask him never ever to do that

again um I look at the body I'm like

probably not now she's just kind of like

figuring out what's happening no I well

I guess do you all want to get out of

here all right

we'll go with you all right

then you hop into a rundown little cart

and she bears you through the mist

eventually it parts forming this

corridor lined with trees that take you

to the edge of a bluff upon which you

see a great star scape it's beautiful

pretty yeah and she says your friends

are waiting for you a night stone

they're all okay they didn't like

horrifically died by something I caused

or anything like that not this time

evylyn no what did you do what Oh what

what's what you you rotted you're all

dead

and then yeah we've all died like

several times like that's just part of

this this this storyline it's fine all

right your cart is reared up and you are

all unceremoniously ejected from it

almost just like like then you try to

get like the last shrapnel of a Pringles

can

junk

spatial spatial references have no

connotation in this place and as you are

flung up toward the Stars you can see

racing across a distant caravans

spanning the sky draping it in a great

starry cloak then you find yourself

hurling down into darkness through stars

no you see your friends hurling down

into darkness three stars just like

following hey guys it was just like

clinging to Politan and grabbing at

whoever else is nearby was it day or

night in mines right now it is

mid-afternoon oh I hate this money but

evil any you fall through the night and

suddenly it gives way today and you

hurled that hurtled down upon the earth

like meteorites but even well you said

you were not falling I did okay alright

then you go to what do we have the

option there just not for me I don't

there seems to be a universal force

pulling you down into this void cool

they're falling I'm fine by myself and

you're not alone been directing this

falling with you is it so this has

happened to me before she passes out

checks his pocket watch exactly well

it's just like takings like like just

coins or anything he can find a nice

person just like trying to like throw

and hit them guys are falling diving in

six the gentle landing or is it like a

meteorite way worse like the other party

is a night stone are they not they are

indeed they're going oh in deed what be

in the

every person yeah that you see at this

table is according to some bizarre

mathematics falling along with you in

this place and then each of you is

falling down onto the onto the cobble of

a city that you can see like there's a

moment as you pass through this dark

cloud where you can get a sense of the

town and you have a moment or two to be

curious about it seems to be surrounded

by water and then each of you comes into

hard contact with the ground and then we

have some mechanism by which by which

you can not take it float over to Paris

I burned my flying I don't do that don't

follow me from there that ah I'll be

within 5 feet of a wall it just says as

a reaction I couldn't see any falling

down which I take with five times my

money level nice yeah nice boots

and I try to slow anyone else I can grab

a little bit like I can't carry anyone I

want to try a news van Rycke then the

break my fall an opportunity to leverage

it I would be more than happy to accept

an acrobatics role for you to take this

old man digit on that 20 council gather

waffle fan your servant palton SEPA as

giving you a massive heap of goodies no

doubt Ellis I will tell me momentarily

jackbox party pack 3 level up dice black

walnut sit and the d NDVI imaginary

bundle that's a whole lot of cool

and you have this this gentleman to

think

so break an old man's body absolutely so

you are you are able to you're able to

leverage the resistance that you're able

to find in this strange continuum to

roll yourself over and then get a good

firm grip on him and it's just like

putting a mullah and you take the damage

instead yeah and like maintaining eye

contact as we go the whole time like oh

this is great

the does misty step conserve momentum in

other words a five misty step from 30

feet of her to the ground will I still

be at the same velocity oh I can do that

never mind no I'm just gonna keep on my

wait what dimension door can dimension

this dimension door if you're moving

you'll still be moving the same speed

yeah can you missed a step ladder you

can but here that's a you know the papen

and probably orient the dimension door

the exit door interesting ways yes yes

okay so you don't you know fill up

Sahara or perpendicular to the ground a

broom that one I'm like you can't fly no

I can't I can Lynn like a cat whoever

can't fly and she's like going to help

death and he's like it's fine I'm a

catch alright so who do you want this

walnut I think I should point out

waffles is also calling inside grab

waffles okay and I don't think I can

dimension door with waffles waffles is

very large but doesn't matter you can

take one creature with you okay then I

will take waffles into the dimension

door with me and I'm just like good luck

I was holding on to Pelton but when he's

like ha Van Rycke tin and likely if I'm

like oh Simon is dead

yeah yeah hurry the manoeuvre good Chris

thinking he can use fly not knowing that

it's meant

that way but we talked about this before

where I could cast it again yeah right

yeah and then I would then this is the

time to go and do that okay so you come

out you maneuver over to me yeah I'm

gonna say you're the you're the strong

one and I'm gonna cast fly on you

yeah so you can hold you grab more than

one person yeah ideally yeah

all right this interstellar evil

soporific filament hair yeah reaches

down from the darkest place in space and

wraps around you by the tail I'm like no

so like I'm like a claw machine yeah and

then I'll grab you first prize

it's contingent on my carrying limit

right yes so question anyone else it

once in I jump on him yeah on the back

oh yeah jet pack I was thinking I could

twin spell dimension door but I don't

think even do that I think if one more

if one person tries to get the cast by

on them does affects one creature it

could end the effective multiple

creatures race on I'm gonna check the

ruling on that yeah there should be a

dick thing for DMS to do yeah beautiful

well one talks the other can think or

quick and spell misty stab I'm sorry

misty stem which is a bonus action right

yes dimension door take one of these

guys and then take that I'm just trying

to figure out that's all I'm just going

out yeah so waffles go through disappear

through a dimension door yeah sorry

Alton's using the old man is padding

you've grabbed hold of Simon and they

have my flank right right you are cool

slow fall or slow falling it's easy for

you we're grabbed cast fly your grey and

I'm holding both of you hmm

so what you have first night nobody saw

yeah you just done it before yeah I'm

carrying it in my carry capacity yeah I

love it so

but dinar so this the trajectory was

very much involved you basically being

bisected on an exterior wall of this

town like without this without this evil

rope from space it would have been a

very different outcome for this Gennari

Prince yeah but it's not though no no

that turned out okay and you have a

moment as you are falling down through

this cold air that gives way into a

gently humid afternoon in the town of

night stone that you are passing by

directly by in some cases beings of

clearly lower planar origin the sorts of

the sorts of monsters and terrors that

that stories are based around geez so

the town you got to be see around you

fully yeah like yeah the talent the

talent you see you later

ranked can I feel it hopefully am i

holding your like so I don't know your

big spin oh man yeah oh good no that's

good yeah as you're falling you can see

that night stone has a palisade around

it and outside of that palisade is a

moat it's almost like the people who

crafted this town took a river sliced it

so it would flow round the town and then

let the river continue on past it and

the island that this are the islands

that this town sits on are basically

surrounded by these wooden Palisades to

protect the buildings within and it is

within the Palisades that you are

rapidly descending you can see that the

buildings all have these sort of clay

tile rooftops these red tiles staring

back at you one of the buildings has a

steep

another one has tall Gables and looks

like a large in and to indicate this

knowledge that you secured from falling

down into the town each side of the

table has a mammoth if you want to be

Chris Chris Stroud where he stole your

map okay so this map is not entirely

correct it's got the little blotches

that you see on the map are not there

from the stones that were throughout the

bridge that connects the town to the

Motte what the castle on it is also

intact okay basically otherwise the map

is accurate I'm gonna draw a little

bridge yeah so it is accessible yeah two

players excellent do we see those so

only two players you do see the trees

outside of town but you're not falling

really anywhere near them I just really

was wondering what sort of climate was

outside or if it was just I don't know

on fire no it's just it's just a idyllic

pastoral on the edge of a woodland kind

of scene there's yeah as you look above

you you see demons Obama's yeah oh good

cool

and Devils hard to tell lots of winged

creatures of tails horns deformities

there's a CS something like a massive

angry vulture person yeah I mean and

we're seeing okay acknowledging us did

you or your scene but you don't seem to

be part of this you don't see whatever

they are engaged in okay is something

they are doing together yes when strikes

know this what I said I suspect

happening I suspect I suspect that Strix

spends some moments before every night

envisioning something very much like

this and wondering for and wondering

perhaps what her part may be in him yes

many of us seen this town before that is

a very good question yeah I mean my I

mean I've seen it before

there's at least one person around this

table who seen it before yeah and her

name is well her name is it's entirely

possible so Rosie I would love it if I

could get a little bit of that East

laughs oh boy okay East Wow and I don't

have any bits to it oh no seats in this

game only Chris and I get the bits only

twelve twelve is okay because it really

has to do with it has to do with the

maps that you have had in your

possession so nice stone and this this

is this is common you've seen this many

many times in your in your practice as a

cartographer the oldest maps of this

place show this River going straight

through oh but it also had a number of

its had a number of dis Donnie names as

well and it spent the largest part of

its history in this area more or less as

a meeting place a shared meeting place

for Vasanti families okay where

festivals could happen and gatherings

among many tribes gotcha

things like weddings for example for

example just for example okay and I

assume that normally there's not a bunch

of demons flying around there were not

even in the not even in the like

sketched in the edge around the map as

decor yeah no where's there anything

like the creatures and now their shadows

are falling all over this place you can

also see that this place is not

uninhabited there are towns folk or

villagers cowering peering up at the sky

through windows or behind fence posts

wondering if this is the end of their

lives as you come plopping down one by

one it might be so does it look like

missus just started are they all show

door they and hiding as though it's been

going on for days they are still they

are still an active panic so you suspect

you've arrived at or near it's like this

event was timed for your arrival yeah

yeah this is just wait it's like the

it's it's like the flashpoint I mean

sword has not even crossed sword yet in

the sky it is just at the moment of its

circling each other testing each other

but they don't seem to be attacking the

town's folk right right now they are

engaged with one another but I suspect

that even that is sufficient to terrify

a mortal we land on the ground and we're

all okay yeah just gonna start praying

right sir yesterday you sort of come

tumbling out horizontally on to the

ground with waffles as just one one sort

of tangled mass of fur and feathers even

sees all these demons and that's

actually like you see her actually kind

of visibly relaxed because she's like ah

I know exactly what I'm supposed to do

so she kind of put Simon behind her and

pulls out the hard spinelli and kind of

gets in the defensive stance and watches

what happens sorry you might probably

wondering why I'm rolling dice oh sure

I'm not this is the this is the bone

crunching sound that van ricktum makes

after with palton on top of him he dies

he looks like he looks like that a fall

down of stairs would be fatal to him he

so come small and brittle an old man so

as as palton kind of crushes him down

into the cobbles he doesn't move right

away now even will run over and lay on

here just like wait wait wait wait he

might be okay you see some blood sort of

coming out that might be that might be

recoverable

the bad blood blood body's getting rid

of did you catch hold person that

doesn't work the hands are out in front

of you like this held back man likes

like a hover hand scenario his own hand

is weakly reaching up and trying to fill

the gap healing I like to intersect and

like take his hand I'm just like it's

okay you copy believe in you he takes

his other hand and heals himself unless

you can see bones knitting together his

arm sort of snapping back into where

it's supposed to be it's like yeah

show's over guys so Strix as you fall

and then roll with your massive soft be

good friend you have a moment there on

the ground to truly consider your

options and you can hear a kind of odd

shuffle step

that's interspersed occasionally with a

hard smack of wood against the street

and you hear a man disruption hmm as

though ever truly every angle in his

vision contains some new horror and then

he trips having looked up into the sky

perhaps too long he trips and finds

himself atop waffles oh wow uhuhu rolls

off and gets himself up on his stick and

then he chastises you and says I knew it

I told them all I knew it I saw this it

was coming he was always coming just

like in the pictures I made they looked

at my pictures they laughed at me but

coming it's real it's here I was right

what pictures my pictures sort of

strange 3-legged date okay farming and I

don't know this look I'll just lead

straight as Strix is like a prison look

stop yet I mean she knows it's like she

hears that juice looks up and she's like

oh no you can see it's basically just

like audio free like there's the

pressure wave of that fall and hitting

it you're just looking up and just

looking at a nightmare come to life

that's when the church bell starts

ringing as your eyes turn in that

direction evil and you see that behind

you on the corner of this square is a

temple of Lysander and you know it

because the symbol of the morning Lord

hangs high a golden sun above the

Great's pair of double doors leading to

its interior back a steeple in which you

see a gleaming ringing Bell calling out

high Sun twelve bells praise the morning

Lord for he has delivered us from this

plight let's go he calls us to this

place of worship come on we all hear

this the rest of us still falling the

rosie has landed like a cat

d/f lands like a cat Oh something dinar

Setsuko thrust down gently yeah and give

all night climbs down off his back

shaken you are all feet touching earth

but only then Brickton was brewing right

and even he you can see is inhaling air

air for the first time since he landed

maybe hear that that that church bell

hole and Carissa is like which side to

peck and there are people in town now

urging on the temple hoping that sucker

can be found within its whitewashed

wooden walls you guys are both still

wearing your rings right yes you feel

any attraction to this temple of

Lysander as a result do we do you I

think we I think I want to go inside all

right that's a good idea the morning

Lord calls you and you shall respond

it's giant

every time after a landing he stands up

and sees evil and paltin and others and

I mean he runs to them is like Yellin

poulton and like a walnut darin what

that know is he do what here's the point

that Van Vechten who's like like dude I

tried man you'll have your time I know I

can't wait yeah fiercely Rick still on

the ground not moving like on Ernie is

looking up at the sky rosy walnut

Karissa and Denard do not touch yeah we

show no physical affection for each

other very much like an invisible water

cooler is here people don't have to pick

strikes up off the ground she does

she'll pick her up like um like not even

expecting like not even reassuring her

just kind of the usual like carrying

baby Strix with her to the church like

come on yeah Oh Simon's here isn't he

but he wasn't with us before we have

Simon yeah you it's a crazy old man with

the staff says don't place your trust in

false gods excuse me don't get her

started here we go which wiry nice to

meet man I tell you about the wonders of

oh I don't want to hear about it it's

all lies you know I'm not gonna hear

about it false Dogma deep in your heart

you know it to be true

sorry I was busy over here what are you

who's them which ones are the false gods

he's like do you have a quill good

morning Lord is one okay that's like

that one all right I feel like that's

exactly right by the rushing flames

flames will consume you in there you'll

all die flames we've got to go put a

fire out let's go I mean there's no

demons flying around in the temple of

levander I imagine somehow they're all

in the sky let's go

everyone the safest place might be in

lausanne dirt amp and temple for now

what's going on here and get our

bearings they listen belonging or

leaking onto the prime material wherever

we are

I've never Strix has never heard of this

no before no through how it's always

happening but it does not have a

beachhead on the primary why she's

freaking out like so she's just frozen

like she's got her this is more scared

than usual I'll send to this guy later

though we can go to the church for now

the American city were making his way in

that general direction as well and also

guiding you along in that direction okay

everyone let's go I wanna I wanna like

pick up Simon and carry him with okay

it's like oh boy I miss you when we get

back you're gonna tell me what's up

there I'm not gonna like it but I'm

proud of you son let's go all right

anybody not going to the temple offender

on the corner of the square is the guy

yelling false gods coming with us

no did I persuade him regular follower

are you sure he seems a nerd to your

persuasion well we can't convert him all

you know maybe he's been hurt before

he's pretty crazy does he have any

literature maybe some other towns folk

stuck a note on his back which says I'm

no I'm next I'm not okay

yes so as you begin to head your way to

the temple and pour in through its doors

you can see other town's folk have

already taken sanctuary in here hiding

behind pillars and under benches and in

confessionals and things like that even

kind of starts like now that she's in

the church and she understands that

there's a good and evil conflict going

on she feels very empowered it's kind of

forgot about everything else that's

happening she's doing her job so she's

looking around to see if there's any

like leadership looking type of people

among the town's Oh make a perception

check

fine 5mm no you don't see any strong you

don't get any strong leadership vibes

about any of the panic people in here

and I'll have to do it and she stands up

podium yeah she finds something to stand

upon and she says people of this town

which of which name I am not aware I'll

expect dramatic corn yeah like pause

marvel they're not for the morning Lord

shines upon us

and we have found his safety here mm-hmm

and we shall prevail on this day yeah as

you're doing that Strix is like just

shuffling down like the Isle of the

desert just like watching us like a

zombie and then just falls flat on to

the ground okay a rat crawls out and

even you know continues like we shall

prevail Elijah sighing fine she's

getting the crowd like yeah yeah yeah

that's what just trying to it's very

clear as you kind of look around and

suss out this place that it seems almost

like it's a converted barn like the

there are wooden posts holding up the

high arched ceiling but then the floor

is still made of dirt and so yeah you're

lying face down in dirt what I wanted

but it's been flattened from lots of

footsteps yeah coming in I make sure to

just grind my face up so it's actually

pretty hard so even then look so she

says who among you can tell us about

this what's going on

choose the dresses the crowd so they

continue to look at you for the next

comfort worry not for me need not know

what is happening to know who will

emerge victorious who you ask

the light she beckons districts

stand up walk up what evil in the word

efface yes just like a tears streaming

up on the little podium she kind of like

what's going on knowledge is power tell

the people what's going on hey I don't

know what's going on tell just tell me

it's the blood war leaking into the

prime material cleaner wherever we are

what is a blood war van ricktum has

taken out iron spikes out of a hit and

is currently driving them between the

seams of the doors and then once he does

that you can see him come pull out from

his coat what looks like a bag and he

grabs a handful of salt so this is I

mean it's it's magic but it's the magic

you learn in school this is the magic

that this is the magic that wise women

have perfected for thousands of years to

protect their homes and families and you

see him lay down the line of it to

behind the doors and actually kick some

of it underneath the seams of the doors

good coverage and strikes notes that and

it's like army over here is gonna think

that's gonna work and it's not gonna

work for thousands of D I mean thousands

I mean endless endless numbers of devils

and demons fighting each other

endless why there is there's no why well

it's it's just the eternal conflict you

know just leave us alone and figure it

out Hey

crying ominous music playing seeing a

familiar panic adiyae then like

approaches Strix and like tries to

comfort her waffles will come over as

well okay rest a heavy head on your

shoulder yeah

just as lean into her only comforts even

though them go around to the people like

touching shoulders and be like the

lightest with you there's about a dozen

people in here with you Oh a just some

children some older folks everything in

between this it's not without purchase

it it seems that he has penetrates into

the scalp then like selsun blue dinar is

gonna help dr. exposition okay he's into

this guy so far across three episodes he

is the one who seems like he knows

what's going on I've got no reason not

to like him he's been somewhat helpful

actually

so dinner I was like yeah I'll help with

the salt he gives you he get actually

hands you some occult paraphernalia and

tells you to nail it to the walls

all right instructions no dolls like

tiny wicker dolls tiny wicker dolls what

you think

might have been a head at one point I

had did you tell us what you know that

van Rycke didn't is a priest of the

morning Lord but he's obviously more

than just that well that's what I'm

wondering is it does she recognize this

is some sort of like acceptable

defensive mechanism this is not in

keeping with the tenets of your faith

this would be deeply apocryphal okay

usage so she kind of walks up to Van

Vechten

actually no two dinars stopping demons

with she tries to just kind of take it

away can she find like a I don't know

even a some papers or like I know what

about that guy just pointed ban right

haha

yeah he's the best no you can nail him

up that was so funny that's actually

just like let's take these and instead

of nailing them to the wall let's um

throw them outside or maybe burn I'll

keep them can we just not nail them to

the wall please

I seem they seemed like to be working so

far I don't see I got no reason to trust

my new best friend she's like why would

those he says we all have our strengths

my dear mine is in the knowledge that

what I have is greater power than that

which you have in your faith that you

get a ritual that actually bonded you

know more than you meant to and actually

kind of like started some sort of an

extra you know ruined everything like

you said so I don't know if your

knowledge is something that we should

count on we all make mistakes

well I'm trying to connect humility is a

noble trait oh well I just like smack

van right there we've seen I mean I've

seen this before we've got orthodoxy we

have yeah and you know beliefs evolve

and it's working out so far and faith

alone will not save us

Wow even giggles tries to hide it

he says you're a paladin love the

morning Lord why are you here I'm not

out there because the morning wood has

sent me to do his will here then why do

you cower under his dress you shut your

filthy mouth yeah

that's regular again you are a paladin

are you not you

yes we've established that part prove it

you don't don't

it's like don't listen don't listen I I

need to attend to the flock and then

together we will prevail yeah fly so you

can go flock off outside buddy you go

for it you got this you seem strong and

that eight-year-old boy isn't going to

save us

forget him hmm nobody might buy us some

time

yeah what you can't save everyone

she would know what they said oh yeah

yes unfortunately what do they say the

the voice you hear beyond says they've

come to take strikes oh there's no you

would hear Strix actually that's

probably still something like it I mean

it sounds weird but it's at us she just

like like a looks intense I don't want

to go please I'm not letting you go

anywhere you know we've gotten into a

lot of trouble since these guys feed the

dogs so do you say anything since she's

not home do you hear her voice eh oh we

tried

okay they're the generals now wait the

what the generals the Strix relay any of

the stuff because we wouldn't understand

it I'm weird what would I think that

means yeah there's a general snail Oh

what I think that means you know we know

what it is no I do I have this feeling

that if I stay here they're gonna kill

everyone in here

do you yes can you do yes I do

yes I do I do feel bad I don't want

everyone in here to die

so what do you say to us I say they're

check to wrench open the spiked door uh

strength OB athletics we will be London

twelve okay

yeah the don't holds fast all right then

I need to get out can you undo no don't

don't do it fabric did is there any

other like like a window or something

their windows yeah I don't window there

ender and various Saints will see

listens districts and strict says don't

go and she's like why we have to

get out of here I don't know any other

way to get out of here you know what I

mean I don't know any other way often

you hear a voice becoming more distant

outside still talking and in front of it

you can't make out what they're saying

what did they so what did they say

there's always another way no this is

bigger than us why difficult take a

moment to explain to the c-team what the

 is going like we owe it was it

pretty much all they explained also to

the shadow council give high basics I

don't even know if I can do an adequate

job but I will try my best for some

reason this

blood war which exists in another plane

of existence between demons and devils

has been ongoing forever it's never

existed here on our home for some reason

it is now and throughout this blood war

there is a a war between two families

the Skiz --ax and the lore Casa the Skiz

exclaim that Strix is one of them and

according to a certain contract with

home and Ron she's the most powerful one

they're trying to take her back take her

home and I can only assume user for

whether their only means to continue

their own war against or kapha that

can't happen this goes beyond us this

goes beyond anything that you know this

is about the existence of all life now

you said you didn't know if you could do

it but I think that was really good that

was quite good yeah all the kids in here

are spellbound and terror in the middle

of justice yes like bouncing off of the

roof off of the floor the pews there are

wet puddles under some of the gangs

yeah liver this in the sunday school

yeah he realized the entire rest of the

temple is silent and everyone's just

staring at him he's just like oh but the

morning Lord will shine upon us and

bring us victory yep Strix is gonna look

at paulsen and go if they don't want me

to go out there I'm not gonna go out

there because you told us not to

sacrifice ourselves we're all in this

together and we're gonna do our best

together

I'm not going to run away good so how

can we help amazing question I'm so glad

you asked Wallman not having a plan no

even hugs dia when I saddle up next to

Van Rycke didn't my guy copy images even

here he's like throwing ointments yeah

ground I say tells me all these little

circles out of salt and some other

crystalline substances wait Ellen what

you told me before I started putting

these things up he says then gets

slapped around again now I would be

there with been written like assisting

okay well whatever it was all right no

he's not on the plan they're horrible

plans I gotta do anything

trust me his pennants are horrible they

are horrible there are demons and devils

here right my family that means they got

here through something some kind of

portal some kind of doorway we just

gotta find this and close it now if I

could insert myself in this zone for a

moment Chris Perkins our cauldron just

tip I would love it if you would

leverage this this unique power to

introduce a character make a big change

to the game push things forward in the

way that you can think of is the most

dramatic plus blended all right there is

a sound that is the sound of the church

steeple being ripped off the building

okay and you see the back end of the

building just sort of fall and tear

itself away just like half of the

building just flew off leaning this big

gaping opening in the back of the church

and standing in that opening is a

creature that is about oh I want to say

15 feet tall even looks meaningfully at

Van Rycke 10 and at the things they were

nailing to the wall and raises an

eyebrow at the creature yeah no but good

thing there was salt yeah that's the

part of the building we didn't we

right and because you know the cauldron

didn't tip which happens all right you

see a creature that looks like this

which one one mark pick fiend and in

this behemoth he stands about 13 feet

tall red scales mace that erupts with

smoke and fire makes that don't quit

yeah so basic basic and after the

building is wrenched away from him he

hurls a fireball into the room my

counter spot oh you sure can counter

spell me - it goes out no after this

thing arrives to the deaath amelie like

still staring at that shouts to the rest

of the party we can start with killing

that time any his initiative times

assemble did we we I mean any spells we

burned yesterday there burned

we didn't rest between you have not

rested yeah all right I really like

party DM mode until this shit's over

this is still intimidate yeah so they

had left from the front right of the

building back they don't appear to have

gotten around the edge eight for dinner

eight for dinar all on-brand

2000 four four four strikes one thirteen

thirteen fortress fourteen Christmas you

were fairly close to ven rechtin as he

was doing his final work you think that

despite all the the mumbo-jumbo that is

coming out of his mouth right now that

you think there is actual power and what

he's doing you don't know how strong it

is but if thing you think if push came

to shove you probably have you're

standing in one of these rings that he's

put out than not if thumbs I mean I'm in

with the adjutant

x1 15 15 and Big Boss Man did not roll

well on his initiative he's all drama

yeah Diaz got 24 thank you that's quite

good

okay yeah yeah oh man we're catching

them and we won't roll for the townsfolk

unless becomes critical yeah what do you

do after the fireball races into the

middle of the room and then disappears

feet away from circuses hound know yeah

super rad idea that melee just got her

out and starts circling back around him

to start setting up like flanking

opportunities or getting him to look in

different directions he's not gonna go

in an attack because it's still a

goddamn pit fiend but he is gonna start

like new ring and getting into position

okay yeah just like start making it so

we good sir I respect us warm tactics

exactly so you're you're you're using

your knowledge of your light knowledge

of knights stone to try to right crawl

through like a mouse thread and I know

how Rosie fights I know how walnut and

Carissa fight so like between all that I

figure they can also either follow suit

or do something similar do you want to

make a stealth check or anything to do

this unseen or don't know obviously I

see me start lookin this guy okay as you

make your way to the torn off side of

the building and you look out you can

see that the battle has been joined

between various creatures in the sky and

blood is splashing down upon Knight

stone by the bucketloads neat so they're

actually like engaged in the skies now

me yeah clouds of what looked like the

world's biggest mosquitoes always yeah

indeed yeah all manner of just quite

frankly alien bodies parodies of natural

beings

shredding each other and they're very

glad that falls upon you is sort of a

black oily substance I've been covering

the worst stuff yeah

right yeah and that's when the

intestines of some creature sort of fall

raining down from the sky and hang

themselves off the palisade wall okay

all right

Rosie yeah okay so yes you did not

engage combat wise right no I did not

okay but that does seem to be what's

going to happen so I guess what Rosie

will do then is how far away

about 30 feet okay before I forget you

guys still have your deaf boards on yes

okay yeah deaf word deaf board and all

right okay okay so I guess Rosie will

let's start by doing a lot of punching

and kicking

do you run right up to this thing yeah

oh yeah this tiny Rosie yes and there's

a lot of fiend kids there's a lot of

things have been going on in this whole

lysander drama and since we got to this

church or is he don't care much for gods

she don't think highly of demons but the

one thing that she can actually

contribute is a lot of very small

punches okay oh my gosh they hurt yeah

they do

um so that's gonna be a 13 that's gonna

be a 21 that'll be a 13 and I'll be at

25 21 and the 25 we'll hit this thing

now I gotta ask

are your feet and fists magical they are

thank you for asking

Oh Josh I think we're I think we're good

on the disco and then I also have been a

needy I'm sure it'll be ridiculous but

concerts for these two hits please okay

that's not that's gonna be a 12 and a 5

for damage and if you are if you did sub

13 on either of those concepts then the

pit Venus stunned his his con bonus is

plus 13 he did not get stunned by either

head so you just hit him in it's like

hitting again

all of spikey scale is significant I

sort of bounced off he almost doesn't

register you because you are so small at

first until you look fixes his eyes down

upon you and then a supernatural aura of

dread seems to wash okay the full

effects of which you won't feel yet okay

no I do have advantage versus being

frightened that's great okay that'll

come in handy I was gonna say also my

aura should help her from being

frightened is your not close enough yet

okay and you did take yep

thank you thank you no thank you indeed

so as you as you peel off to make your

way around to the 15 doing everything

you can

short of banging pots and pans to

attract its infernal attentions as you

are as you are running through this thin

street there is a hail of you are being

followed by a hail of arrows at every

turn boy what's your AC that'll save me

a lot of time

17:17 whoo that's quite good but now

good enough okay dance don't have a

screen for this game so we're all just

watching it it's like in your dad gather

a shower 23 points of damage

is that a single attack or that mission

arrows this is three hits okay so he

gets to reduce one of them my house yeah

yeah I'm Kenny dodge at least a very

first one is that is a 10 okay

so I'm taking yeah go ahead and

subscribe and subtract 5 upset okay

what

so based on what I heard

I assume Van Rycke tan is inside of one

of those circles he sachets into one

right now I will tell let's see who am I

actually I'm gonna convey it okay I'm

right there yeah our disciples are being

written at this point yeah I just want

to let everybody know like regardless of

whether you believe this guy this whole

might be useful to be encircled by yeah

a house roll awakened mind as a party

line so everybody can just hop on the

call and the reason is because I receive

one and then I say it did that one and

then I say it to that one so it's

conducted slowly but but completely but

fully and because I've burned everything

got nothing um got some toll

I do I do have told that I'm not gonna

use it yet

first I'm gonna do a fairy fire on it so

we can enjoy a advantage

that's what des is waiting for okay

that's gonna be good to a satyr is that

is index8 next thing yeah against the

general what's the DC 15 you made it

cool it's got real big stats Oh big ones

uh your sparkles

sparkle out my magic my drama oh we

should have known no then reckon we'll

sort of pull you into the circle with

him

yeah I'm moving already likes you yeah

she likes all of you oh yeah sorry I

step into a circle yeah uh and the sky

is full of these creatures right you're

inside the building so you're looking at

a roof i'm zeebo got torn off it did as

you look out past the steeple you can

see little glimpses of activity in the

sky

fantastic if you need if you need like a

no I got my phone no is it if you need

like a like a visual aid like it so

here's the church basically where are

the people and uh yeah it is it's

raining blood yeah I needed to know

contrastive I'm gonna use call lightning

on the themes great um which I can do

cuz I can see the sky and I would love

for him to make a deck safe he has to be

a fifteen I'm sure he will

he does yeah um but he still will take

half Greek which is three of these

twelve he's like nice try slices into

hair no still yeah just like yeah right

that seems I've hurt him so that's good

news well played well played indeed done

are so he understands English are you

know Sam's coming how do you know cause

he just said nice try what you here

actually is in your head nice try cuz he

basically talks to telepath I love

happen okay okay so I do they understand

calming yes or no clear but the but if

you're in telepathic contact with him

then he should be able to understand you

regardless okay I speak all right cuz

come hand is always an option

I I want to know what sort of bonuses

before I do anything if there's time

from and Rickon are and passed on from

this his rooms and his salt you are not

aware of any oh I know

okay go yeah alright so you just said

get in the salt sure okay you don't have

to be in the salt but yeah you can

because I still have some of these

occult items you do you have a coloring

book your men on you yeah yeah okay the

old do I have time to ask one Rick

didn't what what these will do like I'm

looking at him for help with this he

says there watch Warren's spirit

Guardians will they help us with this

guy

what do you he says their defense have

okay you're defensive yeah I'm uh I'm on

your side all right here it being so

evasive these questions where's the the

he says they protect a buildings not

people you know all right

hmm okay let me take a soup scoop of

salt brains

mmm-hmm and I'm going to throw them I'm

gonna try this trick that didn't work

last time in the game I'm gonna throw

them at the feet of the pit fiend and

I'm gonna try to command count good it's

gonna take the role of the century but I

like it

yeah wisdom safe it is yes I believe so

yeah wisdom saving throw your fortune

yeah so he rolled a three

how long will the command compel him to

show ends of salt well in his next turn

he has to do what I say he has to spend

a whole turn down ting and if he's hit

or whatever it won't stop him and then

his turn after that then it's brother

okay all right

you're right it was magic salt very--it

was well Alton it was cool as hell yeah

God

okay so I'm impressed I see uh so he oh

wait no the fairy fire didn't work did

the shoot okay right I saw him try to

like like alter how hard would be so I'm

just like that's a good idea and using

my Sikh heritage slash this thing I

never used which I should I'm going to

cast evil eye on him okay which gives

him a minus four on I think like

everything so checks tax and

[Music]

palton do something we've like never

seen him do before that's like crazy

Bustani magic is writing that since

winter split yeah what does it look like

yeah right what does it look like you

tell me what can I do you think that

you're the politician it could be you

know it could be something that you do

with your face it could be a gesture

that you make with your hands to sort of

create an eye like symbol I'd imagine he

like gives this like at first kind of

like what the hell is he doing like just

like me mug in like stank face at him

but then like his eyes just get like

super bloodshot like just laying all the

way in for like a second and that just

goes away

oh and we see like a power come out

mm-hmm Sharingan yeah recipe we're sort

of creeped out by it actually oh yeah

Jesus I'm so track all of us are

negative for

okay dinar already I even was preparing

to do something but she saw it dinar did

and she's familiar with that technique

so she knows that this monster is good

for the next turn so I guess she'll kind

of like just grab her sword and go in

with the heart of Spinelli blazing is

this a fiend just I'm curious

oh yes okay oh my goodness plus fiend

okay so that first attack is a sixteen

miss what you think capacitated by the

command so where she not have advanced

enough or not what does the command text

say about his state he could still hangs

himself right it doesn't go into it on

here masa first level spells she did

yeah as target must exceed wisdom saving

throughout this fellow's no dad doesn't

understand your language or and he can't

do things to sell form okay so I can't

defend itself as well conditions on it

you played it in the past yeah it was

like they were stuck doing that cuz I

did this disarm before disrobe before

somebody had to tell ya stabbing the

moment but this is this is definitely

another class of creature I mean the

truth is with its int like with through

just the way that its mind and eyes work

it may be able to count that much salt

in a split second and even while he's

carrying the five he can still bat away

something that comes yeah on his hands

and knees just out okay guys gotta keep

that out in it better sound again yeah

exactly

no hubris no here look let's say that

this is what happened so as you swing on

he loses count

and then she goes in for another try 47

million 14 that too is amiss alright why

she misses twice what happens why wasn't

she wasn't she hit cuz she's her aim is

off bounces off this game she's so

frustrated by her she she is confronting

what is arguably the most powerful

fiendish force in her lifetime

yeah a real eye and as you close in you

notice that even though he is distracted

there is a supernatural aura that

surrounds him that will affect him on

your next turn that seems to sort of

bury any hope within you so that is

almost certainly connected to the Miss

Perfect I have none but even with my

aura that protects me from being

frightened oh well then you'll be fine

you would not be affected by this the

aura of courage with are you still miss

yes I know but just in case anyone's

wondering in there within 10 feet of me

they cannot be frightened great that's

good news for Rosie yeah because Rosie

that's gonna come upon you is he so it's

you have to spend his next turn doing

this next time so his turn is spent he's

done he's counted he's confident he's

actually overjoyed that that exercise is

over and he knows exactly how many

grains of some what a relief yeah indeed

and then he focuses attention on you

once more and since talking is a free

action he sort of looks at you evylyn

and says I haven't killed a servant of

the morning Lord in years telepathically

says you think you can rely on the Sun

not for much longer I know I can rely on

him come at me bro

yeah alright do you have any

lesser fiends out there that you want to

to get fiendish should pile in

absolutely gone yet death is not the

worst thing I have experienced all right

there is a an ear-splitting peel screech

over him

[Laughter]

I would like cthe wrist drab walnut on

grass and Denard Blitzen to make a DC 14

Constitution saving through the two of

you who are in the rings have advantage

okay then you fly up and throw the salt

are you ready throw it in my back the

same salt ring how closer you guys to me

because you get my bonus sonic what's

your I'm gonna say they're in the same

salt ring but you're not did you want to

be a pleasant leave it actually throws

okay so they're not all right they're

not within five feet then so they don't

get my that's anyone that's twenty two

for me was are 2118 quite good so this

advantage yeah yeah so this this sound

this otherworldly shriek just bears down

on you and it's everything you can do to

keep from being completely pressed into

the earth but but you you're able to

manage it with a few shakes of your head

you can emerge on the other side alright

Oh tricks so here's what I'm going to do

a long time think about it so I found

matter G and I can also speak abyssal so

what I'm going to do is I'm going to as

loud as I can point at him and in

abyssal I'm going to yell at the other

army above us but he's incapacitated all

right

oh wow does I can write because of the

acoustics in this fine building your

voice carries even better than you hoped

it could as it pours out an abyssal the

clarion call the general is vulnerable

now is the time to attack you hear

shrieks more shrieks than you've ever

heard in your life know what I look at

everyone else and go hide in the circles

and Rickon pulls out from his robe two

desiccated hands and holds them up in

the air and other is an incantation at

the end of which he you see that the

tips of the fingers of these shriveled

hands burn off with like candles and as

their as the flames consume their

fingertips he says you are all blessed

all right you all have the benefits of a

blessed spell which means you get to add

a d4 to your attack rolls is also for at

least a minute okay I will do quick and

spell science as my bonus action after

the sound of the fountain turning right

and each of the hands has four fingers

and there are eight of you so oh so yeah

if you are covered I'm going to cast

these throws hands over shoulder I'm

going to cast sanctuary on you know on

on dia what yeah what does that mean

it's a cleric spell I have to what if he

attacks anybody though what does that

mean this is spelling I have to look it

up because I don't have Clair cards cuz

I forgot oh are you a cleric while

you're doing that

van Rycke team has completed his action

does love crew want waffles to do

anything oh god just stay safe fine

okay okay she'll stay out of combat for

the time being she should hide under a

Pew yeah

so the Pew is actually raised yeah feet

off of the ground it's more like a it's

more like a teeter totter very good

Chris Simon's in here yeah no it's just

things getting K walk yeah that was you

the dirt I would love for him to shoot

it there hey he will shoot as hard as

the general he'll walk up and open his

mouth and a dark will fly out okay

the dart hits it does a piddly one point

of damage on it good boy and because the

general is immune to poison in the

poison condition it has no other effect

other than to annoy the hell out of the

general good boy Sam I know right what

yeah this dart sticks in the generals

eyelid oh and it is destined imagine a

dark eyelash imagine a dart iLabs oh I

don't know what to do now because she's

cast sanctuary on me it doesn't it

doesn't mean you have to know but if he

attacks it's gone yeah we're just kind

of you can't attack right cool good it's

just the ISIS is he on spell yeah what

happens is that so what that means is

the creature if the a target him they

have to do a wisdom saving throw or and

if they fail they have to immediately

target something else no I don't want to

target anything else either

so as you wanted to attack you keep like

being distracting yeah then you could

attack gosh just pelted with arrows and

soon they stepped outside so they count

to four sanctuary and they can't hit you

they have to also make a wisdom

statement girl great maybe I'll write so

I only got shot by the arrows basically

after as soon as we were exposed to the

sky

okay I would like to keep moving around

then like continue my circling yelling

loudly so he'll look at me but still try

to get back underneath the rooftops

against I'm not hit by arrows and there

you need some cover yeah and then if

possible I would like to delay my action

until after the pit fiend attacks or if

I'm attacked and then I would like to

try to make an attack roll after that

and move my initiative place to that is

that a thing doing anything right now

sure you can give up the best initiative

in the entire to go after your worst foe

absolutely that's why we offers that

okay so the situation is now that no one

is attacking this pit fiends you use

afterward Lightning youth swim in a line

and this yes right okay so okay can I

use all right

so I can't actually attack it just a

real line a little bit I'm sorry can I

use like the the like the distract

action or the help action where the heck

that is that someone else can have an

advantage or the chat role against it

yes how interest I want to do that then

yeah okay no way what gets pissed off at

me to text me and it'll fail well

someone else can do a way better attack

me yes we are sick combo uh let's see

yep there it is even when you're gonna

have an advantage on your next attack

rolls okay okay

this is a rational thing good something

good all right so I Rosie look at your

death and say I see what you did there

yeah and then he looks deep into you and

he says oh oh no oh my oh no and then

he'll call up to you and say

telepathically it's to the agent yeah

yeah my lord he points at him you know

he's the last more contra delicious my

lord

did I leave that part out our ascendancy

is assured Oh only mortals stand between

us not for much longer

got the mightily distracted Rosie there

this guy is not paying any attention to

you all right

so does that mean I get advantage yes

you see him unfurl his big wings and

turn his back to you more or less as he

faces death okay I'm out of key point

Ethan takes a cloven hoof step forward

toward d6 26:20 at 23

all three hit big money the back side of

his head seven and six 23:23 twice

what's ditch right kick it kick the

pimple you just pummel him I'm out I

can't do anything else now cuz I didn't

take a long rest sir short rest rather

yeah yeah just dry all right there

is a sound of spells exploding outside

the church doors like somebody's using

magic to break in through the seal the

doors at the front of the church so now

forces are coming in on that side and

you can see you here just fireballs

being blasted by one after another into

these doors and then it is getting

started so we'll do the adjutant's turn

and then I think that'll be the last

turn before the break

okay so Dias huh you having been exposed

to the sky and the creatures that dwell

there and learning very swiftly that it

was not to your liking you began to go

from awning to owning trying to protect

yourself and this system has this system

has worked quite well for a while and

then almost like

a black lightning strike immediately in

front of you as you are trying to make

your way around to the back there is a

woman before you a demonic creature

infinite in her capacity for cruelty you

can tell this in an instant

black wings tucked up behind and you can

see that she has in her hands a bow

do you suspect that she may have been

your enthusiast she hurls the bow to her

side

and then from nowhere tiny blubbering

servant sees it at in the air and

retreat into nothing she withdraws a

massive whip that appears to be made

from a stroke of lightning snaps it once

and then turns it on you say Jerry you

all hear the oh yeah right here who

isn't saving throw it to what I think

it's my spell save yes it is sixteen

that's that's quite hard uh-huh oh

he's doing great yeah she's doing great

I'm not doing great then see she hits

you all here the whip crack definitely

outside mm-hmm eight points even with

like a lighting super fast whip detect

it's still uncanny dodge it yeah exactly

so you're so you're able to but it's a

you your instinct is correct uh-huh and

then just at the end of the movement

just at the end of the movement it

catches the ankle and she pulls you down

to the ground she cracks it again so

does this sit the sanctuary effect lasts

for the duration with the spell right I

think it's once once they yes they over

comment they've over coming right I

think once they overcome it they've

overcome okay and so as though it might

be a what the spell still might be in

effect but not to her yeah exactly so as

I said and then as as you as you hit the

ground that that feeling of

security and safety that that haired the

head with it just an element of your

friend Strix you can feel it just

evaporate off of you as she approaches

so this is a separate attack though this

is a separate act okay so by the wording

of sanctuary it sounds like it would

require a second wisdom saving throw it

sounds like it's every attack or harmful

spell for the full minute okay nice did

not this did not work so if it doesn't

work she has to target someone else

there's no one arranged she can't and

she loses it huh okay that's fine oh so

she makes this last twenty yeah

the your servant erinyes has brought you

a boon we're talking about DMV minis

betrayal at Boulder's skate and play

Matt who boy so he so she was able to

break through the ability

what's your armor classic Ivan team so

good no it's so close no I'm saying

the her attack is so close and you you

think for sure it's going to catch you

and you're able to move just enough so

that you can feel it's searing along

your cheek and feel your hair raise up

Josh if you'd be so kind as to tip the

cauldron and Chris is like you know it's

really fun da the collar was

tipped by broken Sentinel who did a

hundred thousand bits as a donation holy

okay my idea I thought I thought that it

didn't happen like that's when I saw it

I was like oh well that can't possibly

be true thank you so much here's what

you bought the money behind exactly uh

yeah behind the the pit fiend who has

now stood up to his full height

he is taking in the scene of battle

identifying in his incredible in

select the precise order he will murder

every mortal in these two parties and

then the punishments he'll visit upon

them as he seizes their souls down to

the hills behind the palisade wall there

is a creature that the party can see if

they look behind him they can see it

looks like a massive serpent has

slithered over the top of the wall and

then the closer it gets you can see that

rising up at the fore of this serpent is

a eternally beautiful woman who carries

no less than six swords and you can see

that she is crawling slithering toward

the the pit fiend and when she gets

within about a hundred and twenty feet

she is no longer there but she is

instead right on the pit fiend and all

six swords are raised here's the break

we are going to come back after the

break and finish killing the c-team the

buffle crew hopefully you'll come back

for that it's gonna be like a couple of

minutes tops

tops we have a break bundle it's got

Neverwinter no foot it's got a cryptic

t-shirt

it's got wat SI dicen bag dandy beyond a

legendary bundle recall gathered thrown

that all bits for today's mega game have

a charitable purpose what is that

charitable purpose Chris Berg and it is

races this this wonderful wonderful

wonderful wonderful group of people who

are reuniting families torn asunder by

immigration policies bringing children

back to their parents after they've been

stolen away by the government and

detained they are fighting this fight

and we are helping them as best we can

indeed indeed absolutely yeah so with

that in mind breaks coming we're

tracking the bits we're gonna put them

to the right place we will see you

momentarily I'm gonna take it form you

then my son is very precious to me he's

a sweet boy reminds me of how my own

seed was obliterated within

within that royal uterus in which he was

carried and I now treasure him as

knowledge of my worthlessness but so

instead Mary offer a series of different

heirs perhaps to please you and

tantalize you hurry quickly my children

I will have a cavalcade of Sons for

these royal men she says you are an

idiot I'm already in process it can't be

stopped

I have produced the blow man out of my

busy life but I've bothered to get a

tail and it's just sort of cavorting

like this like 1998 website I can think

of it's a page counter

okay so dancing lights is the first time

I have raised 300 sons and daughters

agreed

hey there little buddy

this is all very confusing to you I know

how you gonna get to me it's really hard

which like a treat oh yeah you go buddy

that's for you

enjoy the doc

oh no I think oh he's fine yeah yeah

yeah Claire you got the diplomas on a

temporal it's not damaged yes I'm good

yeah then it was only like a three

minute break right see we're on brand we

that's exactly right just a CT where the

wind I mean we're the best boys we have

a we're gonna make it hurts yeah

Peavey's yeah we should make like custom

beam there's no we should do and then

when Jerry comes breaks so they don't

know how to oh my goodness

these are all suppose occasions oh yeah

when that second hundred when that

second right Holly thing you always came

in usually our houses

oh that's up up just like man

yeah glitch like they got broken no

thanks about this I said earlier I was

like oh this is gonna be high really

enough you were five tips we shouldn't

tabletop this too much by it's happen

they're all two levels higher than us

therefore stronger all my thoughts are

to them

yeah legit my play well also can I'm

losing track of exactly how many spells

in the boss they're like hmm like it's

perfect protector we didn't even extra

you've been bucks I know a Mayan tackles

our cousin dude I was thinking about

a muffin evylyn wait oh my god well

because you do it your damage output

I've seen it firsthand it's higher than

mine so everything sometimes sticks and

larges me and then that's really fun no

you'll be I'm saying like mega combos

all day yeah maybe that gives us super

strength and then get the crazy buff

sepia

okay well there's no there's something

fighting it for us yeah but the war is

about to find its way in here - all

right I said that for me tell me what to

do

Amy it's the cool play I always want to

kill everything I don't like living

things not murdered it's a treat I know

it's funny all right I always have to be

the voice of reason it's so odd I know

that's like that's walnuts yeah that's

the joke right that when I'm the moral

compass and you know that we're asked a

compel Dooley I thought about that

but then it's just like hey go murder me

let me make up oh yeah oh oh I don't

know is the other question because like

protection from good and evil will be

pretty pretty powerful here I'm

frightened possessed and anything that

tries to hit him and that's I think you

know it's disadvantage that's one of the

coolest command I've ever seen

well I tried in our game like

better because that was grains and then

a person this is salt

yeah teary yeah yes so Bundy I'm done

let me sit down you goof nope my gosh is

the only one who matters microphone

check

[Music]

oh hello I didn't see you there

this is Jared Kaler Kim's and this is my

Lowell and this is Milo and this is

Christopher Perkins game of the stars

pitch FINA Island and this is the

conclusion arc of waffles incorporated

ooh ooh so delicious two solid days of

D&D excitement culminating in the

annihilation every pz k TT p PK k Oh

Marilyn adjutants justice and the Meryl

if came out yes so the Marilyn is

looming behind the general is very much

really are you ready to for the very

first time on the screen to have me roll

dice against you yes right here it comes

okay I mean I just remember I said you

know thinking back all these great day

indeed times seven attacks all right

here we go it's in the tail and so 6/3

in kill obviously that's an incredible

Vanilla Ice track mm-hmm so AC nineteen

correct correct and your weapons

counters magic weapons all right through

it works the tails gonna do about Costa

yeah one hit two hits three hits four

hits five hits memory okay five all

right

so much damage yeah exactly so 5 times

13 so 65 5 whoo yeah so she just starts

carving up the general like a turkey no

exactly does every every sword like you

would think at some point these swords

would inconvenience one another but it's

it's its concept of space must be unlike

that which we know

I'm good I'll just make a mental note

that she's gonna activate after the

adjutant movie cthe RIS hmm there's some

devil on demon action playing out before

you and I'm looking at my my bag of

tricks and I got nothing a lot can't

trips like junk and where how where you

walnut I'm in a circle adjacent to you

focusing on my lightening spell okay

things land on the rooftop and sort of

skittering and scampering up there now

digging their claws into tiles okay cool

then like tiny beams of light beginning

to find their way through the tears yeah

that's good news yeah like that

we're outclassed I have a I have a

friend in high place haha oh no I'm

unfortunately still in service too

and I'm going to again return Lagasse

from his staff form to his serpent form

and and you can see instantly curls

around your hand the dagger he the

second is a waffle crew and other folks

what does the got to you look like it is

a dark purple snake-like thing but it

has a bifurcated head and many many many

eyes first travel warnings right and

some crystal horn in its tail it holds a

you on T dagger that you gave me in an

eight that's right and I'm going to pray

to this patron God that I'm an unwilling

servant of but when it suits me when

it's good for me we can work together

perhaps and I say oh trying to take the

sarcasm out of my voice oh great sang

Willis impressed am i by your capacity

to eat

just chomp there again on the mortal

plane there is great bounty for you to

harvest and strengthen yourself and I

need a win here buddy a real Jam but I

think you're gonna like what you see

you're gonna like there is nothing but

the continued scraping of talons on this

rapidly disintegrating country perish

sometimes again put on hold I'm on a red

right now let's see so if that speech

and that doesn't count for as the action

oh it counts as the yeah alright well I

was gonna say there's no one else I can

do relax my feelings i'm keiko with the

penalty from the evil eye oh it's

negative for right it's 4:15 and sorry

it's so what safe - thanks you oh that

is so that would be a 16 but with the

evil eye it becomes a 12 14 15 excellent

it's damaged yeah um till next sunrise

friend to next summer

yes yeah so that that's just there its

ear thing all right why don't you use

that power all the time yeah he doesn't

want to I've been I've been holding onto

it for there's locations I figured this

seemed like the time that's good

by the way van Rycke tan is standing

next to you in this salt ring and he

just says that is the most up

thing I've ever heard

that's really no it's okay let you try

it no I don't think I will way together

meeting all right and as he says that it

starts to get very very dark outside the

sunlight seems to disappear and turn

into this sort of Umbra loud and UDF

being outside can see an eclipse well

that's good the Sun is being blocked out

oh yeah there's a good car that's no

evylyn in this case you sense a sudden

diminishment in the power of this place

as the Sun is shrouded in the power of

the like yeah do not like yeah done are

so the pit fiend is now occupied with a

third party combatant yes

so I mean getting in the middle of that

it seems dangerous

Thanks we're fine for me it's fighting

yeah yeah I don't really arrange two

attacks that a viable here um I want to

ask I want to try to is there any

inference I can make her or can I even

ask the doctor like the creature that

attacked the pit fiend it's not a friend

of ours

it's the pit fiend eyes is just gonna

turn on us to do I know do I have any

sense if the pit fiend eyes you Merle is

gonna do yeah yeah you can make a make a

usually a red marrow religion check yeah

okay I know yeah you would you've

probably seen in texts and things

this sort of teacher before you've seen

a webinar okay yeah I can't see us that

that's 1/8 plus 1/8 plus a zero thinking

that it may be some sort of demonic

creature you think yet it's a threat to

anything yeah good all right you don't

remember what it's called or what it

does we have that other stuff I don't

know I so details Chris's point yeah we

are I feel out of depth I also have seen

evylyn in combat and you know wouldn't

openly say this but internal monologue

she was doing more damage than dinar

could so I want to try to out where is

she in relation to deny she she is

between you and the pit fiend because

she's right up in its girl okay am I

able to grab her and pull her into the

circle with me

assault circle you could try if you're

not happy with that you've been attempt

to resist his tug back into the circle

that would pull you out of melee combat

with him I don't think she wants to me

pulled out of me a comment well you know

it'll also probably kick the out of

her

that's true Oh would it get it it's not

it's not already engaged like it gets an

attack of opportunity even though it's

fighting something else um given the

nature the immensity of what it's

currently confronting it probably

wouldn't concern itself terribly with

evylyn it's you could probably pull her

waist right I can i is the distance far

enough then then I can run up to her

buffer and then bounce back in my full

circle in my little hidey hole yeah

that's my line I mean at the end of the

day looking out for number one

I want to get back in that saw from this

day forward well do i Tex believing

naturally exploited yeah oh yeah it's

gonna develop heart condition you know

I'll make any attack to rush up there

and just tap her yeah and what are you

trying to leave you her with protection

good and evil can it be like a little

paladin high-five okay

great man oh yeah yeah hey high five is

on brand yeah all right just for just

for the sake of why not I'd like each of

you to roll a 20-sided die to see if you

connect 18 haven't rung what elicit tell

them what they've won

Oh trail and baldur's gate hoodie never

weiner never weiner never whiner never

whiner hoody bulldoze guys Nova BMD

beyond legendary bundle going out of the

channel thank you so much fine high five

does it just protect you good people on

both of us both of you all right so they

have disadvantage when they're going

after you evylyn attack rolls on you and

then yeah and then you can't be well you

already couldn't be frightened but you

can't be charm possessed or frightened

cool cool paulten yes you're off so it's

it's pretty engaged with this horrible

demon creature yeah yeah does it look

like I'd be able to like just kind of

sneak in there and be able to touch it

and quick and then like kind of dip out

without Boop yeah just a little boo does

that seem like something I can do or

would you can try do it do I know if

that would be attack of opportunity

there's a pretty good chance all right

all right I'm gonna try and because also

using my Sikh heritage I'm going to

attempt to bestow curse which is a

wisdom saving throw and it will have

minus 4 on that against your like

hitting my double-time boom so that's a

save of 15 all right first thing comes

you touch him saving throw oh my yeah

look at these horrible what's kind of

safe is it wisdom is it there's some

saving throw I remind you is plus ten

year old of four yeah so again with more

minuses on top of his - what's he

allowed when these roles would have been

if there were screen there the curse

effect I have bestowed I'm going with

wall cursed the target must make a

wisdom saving throw at the start of each

of its turns if it fails its waste this

action doing nothing we've done - for

nada okay it's all working together

salary just like an attack of

opportunity against you okay the penalty

okay but first that's to make a wisdom

say yeah hmm at minus-4 okay it rolled

to 26 minus four is 22 so it does get to

attack you okay but it is minus four on

this attack and so with its big fiery

mace it rolled a 21 minus four is a

seventeen he can't get frightened oh

yeah I can't get friend and also he has

the or a protection oh he didn't make a

saving throw no yeah no disadvantage on

the attack there we go yeah here comes

the second role that's 21 minus four is

a seventeen even tries to mom arm in but

doesn't get it up yeah

all right so you take 15 points of

bludgeoning damage from the mace and 21

points of fire damage from the mace for

a total of 36 points of damage

cool okay I think this is a no-look

right yes

hey no look blind swing its just

instantly just like there's like no

difference the same second it's like

right whoever's like behind you just

Chris you just see this pair of legs go

flying it's just like a really quick you

just feel like and then a crash against

some pews and that is that come on go

with al evylyn yeah you saw this

backward swing take paltin and send them

across the church y'all right okay hold

on I get you go no do you think oh how

fun hey I'm just gonna sit and cry bit

okay maybe go see maverick time he could

help you

I'd rather die okay evylyn is going to

yet again she was readying a spell but

then all of this stuff happened we're

like all of a sudden she's protected

from evil good so she's like well sorta

flame again goes in for the attack I did

the faints you would have advantage I

would bandage remember it's gotten so

dark now your flame lights up actually

pretty brightly me sick so that's gonna

be a and your bless you to add in you

for yes okay Wow okay

awesome that's a twenty nine oh yes cool

that's good awesome then crank the juice

she's also gonna use divine smite cuz of

course yeah um light of Lysander

compelling so we're gonna do a punishing

blow his divine energy ripples through

this creatures flesh and black blood

flies out away from it the how much of

that was fire um would you say

six which was those were something like

ten or eleven

okay I'm gonna subtract that because it

is immune to fire okay my first attack

yeah keep it keep it moving okay she

smiles

winningly and says this one's for a

left-hander okay that's what you can do

to a teens no d-force yeah that's like

yeah it's a lot any burn another join

thing yeah I mean it's a dumping in

every you used one previously I used I

use a spell slot each time I see

starting to run out yes yeah I mean I'm

like that's good a time as I need to use

it much like so oh yeah okay so any time

is the right time

yeah and don't bother adding the fire

damage no you know oh I already did that

I'll just roll again do I start over

okay so man I rolled way worse that time

general is pleased ma'am 34 okay thank

you how's that still good mm-hm it's

still good all right this creature is

well and truly bloodied for this it's

it's looking like a bit of a mess turn

going down to the general Chris Perkins

yes Jerry

would you like a cauldron tip for the

general yes yes enjoy my friend alright

dark know these don't always have to be

bad know

so you've been hearing the skittering

across the rooftops of creatures landing

on the church they're tearing away at

something but you don't see much

evidence except again more bits of dust

falling and maybe not so much light

coming through but you do can you can

see through the roof and various points

but then you realize that's what you

shouldn't be paying attention to when

the doors to the church blow open blown

to smithereens and a bunch of tea flings

come swarming into the room and you

count nine of them you can see that they

are all wearing bucket hounds with their

horns sort of protruding out through the

middle of the helm and where you would

see normally eyes you don't see anything

but a glyph oh that's terrifying and

they're wearing black satyr black robes

like it looks like some sort of ancient

arcane ruin crescent-shaped with seven

smaller signs embedded in it well

goddamn

is that bad the same symbols appear on

your Crescent staff oh

they sort of gaze blindly around the

room and then in this mob with their

hands outstretched just pour towards

tricks we can untap the culture thank

you Oh general help he is confounded by

evil eyes and and bestowed curses he's

got a marelit demon he shouts up a

command and infernal for the adjutant to

call down reinforcements to take this

Merrill if off his case absolutely do

you mean that handle that after the

general yes

the gem

really really wants a piece of DF but at

this moment is going to go after the

Maryland so juicy yeah yes I'm ready all

right so four attacks more attacks

actually ACH she has got resistance to

or immunity to or dam okay exactly that

was cursed he has to do a business safe

before you can attack right right now me

that hey how's this gonna say so Alyssa

is ruined are we out of prizes or do we

have more prizes Jack Ponce party pack

for that's really good one

elder with me hex chest Dean maybe on

legendary bundle get you a straight

prizes on the way alright so she's out

he attacks with the bite and rolls a

whopping 26 hits all right you shall

take half damage from it so eleven mhm

and she's immune to the poison condition

so she's not worried about that business

she's loaded then he tears into her with

a claw or actually makes another wisdom

save fails it was not attacked with a

claw then swings a mace or tries to is

successful bashes her with a thirty two

to hit very good and it's a total of

thirty or the ship any fire resistance

fire manatee fire resistance yeah okay

so she takes ten points of fire and

fifteen points of bludgeoning okay and

then with a lash of his spined

tail first he makes it wisdom safe and

succeeds then he swings the tail around

and it's a twenty three only attack role

which is a hit and does 24 points of

bludgeoning damage it's like a beautiful

mind

yeah laughing this is a speed perfect

and the whole time he's watching DF more

than his wife oh yeah he doesn't even

need to any other lesser fiends you want

absolutely it is a did is at that point

as he delivers three savage crushing

blows on the mare lift that a flock of

these shrieking vulture men

descend actually they wouldn't because

they're demons

yeah that's true

but they might be oh I don't know wand

Devils that's true

or spined Devils Devils Devils pages we

drop me anything they drop down in a

cloud of massive bat like shapes but

none of them are able to keep purchase

she assumes a defensive posture that

involves the whirling of all six blades

in a region around he's an art maneuver

exactly

ancient and devilish Strix you see these

9t flings and I see my symbols yes those

are mine that's my magic I made it up I

say that to myself but that's mine

I guess oh where do I see Deus anywhere

no nowhere I know we went outside

you do know anyone outside okay um I am

going to miss you step away okay as far

as you - the fiend ah that's what did

you did your choice I mean yeah away

from the tea-things virtue closer to the

pit feet you got the rock you got the

hard place

yeah I I guess like I guess yeah I don't

even think about the pit bean I go

backwards and then I if I for my cuz I

was my bonus action for my action I

don't think I have any why don't you

have any more polymorphs so I am going

to misty step again outside outside okay

that's when you CDF okay in the presence

of an armored feather winged woman with

a metal horn helmet of lashing him with

a whip of lightning I scream at her okay

and then we drop to van Rycke teen who

immediately leaps out of his circle and

goes blade first into one of the

things well snapping the tiefling

through the neck rule and the tiefling

drops to the ground into the dirt

[Music]

sky is the best the salt yeah cool

so restrictions appeared outside yes

they eclipse so she is not under the

protection of any kind of awning or

rooftop right now rekt screamed at the

lady yeah

seeing that ideas like immediately like

stresses and hand out of her it's like

strict no too late

and so whip lady is still in front of

them mmm deeply profoundly so right and

by my understanding still seems like she

is on the side of the pit fiend correct

but or she is definitely trying to do as

much damage to you is a fossil being

she's definitely against you that's the

main thing that you know okay she's got

that whip okay yeah yeah restricts

tricks appeared there so deal with

gutter then actually one catch his

lunges in her with it engages fully into

her I love it

I'm glad you do tell me tell me what

happens next

okay yes d20 please tell me what happens

next

perhaps a 2008 plus total 17 gutter

skitters off of this hellish iron

breastplate

with a with a shower of sparks great and

while she laughs at me

I use my cutting action to disengage and

then move towards tricks okay so you

basically just like really quick it and

then in a moment yes you go right around

yeah alright very good

Rosie yeah so our boy here's bloodied

yes he's engaged with this mess so Rosie

[Laughter]

no this is this is Rosie's moment to

shine

uh so okay describe to me what this

Marilyn like it's a snake with a like a

curved neck that brings oh yeah you're

talking about it yeah yeah yeah Charlie

she has the upper system a orange she

when she's fully all centaurs are hot

she's fully up she's about eight feet

tall okay

hi told the nine Rosie would like to

climb her like a tree and use her as a

springboard to Aria tack she has many

limbs like a tree yeah I feel like I

could use her like a ladder and kind of

jump from limb to limb and then leap off

of the top of her head if anyone have

been doing the transient yeah if anyone

could do it it's Rosie yeah it's

probably too close to really get the

melee attacks on itself I'm what I need

from you yeah is acrobatics like how

like this is a dance like y'all ain't

never seen before

yeah me all right acrobat deuce i think

i'm plus 6 on acrobatics right yep okay

okay that's a 19 okay that's pretty good

it's quite good okay so this happens

yeah we're rolling per limb it happens

just through the process cuz we recall

that we're talking about fully six arms

yeah fully six hell forged blade got it

the fact that you only escaped with four

points of damage is to your credit yeah

all right just a nick here and there

yeah yeah that's exactly but absolutely

so we're talking about and it doesn't

even seem to notice you it is it and

this pit fiend are engaged in martial

combat on a completely epic scale hate

each other

no missing at each other like gibbering

in languages the other does not

understand the entire time right maybe

that's the problem

so absolutely so where are you jumping

off of this Maryland I think I would

want to get probably up to her shoulder

as as far as I could climb and then go

right for the face of this pit faint

yeah because Rosie lived a long fruitful

life and she's one way to go just sick

of it and do I saw an advantage on this

pit fiend yeah bless okay right same as

a beef fort isn't okay before to the

role and default rule okay that's not

gonna be great

that's gonna be yes five seven eleven

seventeen that does not hurt him okay

that's just one though yeah okay that's

fine that one probably went oh yes

that's gonna be a lot to take a twenty

seven or so and then the next one's

going to be a ten plus that's a sixteen

so only only one of my hits gets in and

it is my quarter staff which is going to

be good night woman that's only five

points

beautiful running up the demon whacking

him right on the nose yes demon parkour

you sort of make him go cross-eyed for a

second as you pull your staff away after

striking him right between the eyes and

he just sort of has to shake his head

and steady his eyeballs again I'm just

gonna now riding on the snarl its

shoulder and I look mad did you like

intimidate everything for she can yeah

does she want to say something to him

yeah she's out there perched on this

demon oh if someone like climbing and

was like get your together yeah I

guess this is a blood war between them

and I got nothing to do with it so what

would she look what she possibly say

that would be intimidating to a 15 she

would say I've lived a hundred and

twenty years and then I got some erase

cuz Chris Perkins D aged me and now I

think I'm like a knee I don't know

anymore

listen I've been on this planet a long

time but on this plane I've seen some

 and I ain't afraid of you at all I

don't know what I don't know what kind

of intimidation would happen there for

him would he would he feel bad that a

tiny grandma wasn't I

you see he sort of he can't quite

process it hey did that tiny little

thing it's like that's what's insulting

no she tried he's like you

telepathically says to you well I've

lived a thousand years huh and I look my

age yeah and I don't have to put up with

that talk from a mortal puny windbag

like you little lady

he's got penalties yeah he's got

penalties up the wazoo in the mean time

the members of the Skiz Excalibur Valle

pulled out ceremonial sacrifice daggers

and are trying to basically a twisty

kind with the bloodshed yes exactly the

cemeteries stick them to Van ricktum is

called Chris's Chris knife yeah Chris

okay so eight of these blades come at

him and you see him do this dance like a

man in his 40s using his thin silver

sword in one hand to knock daggers side

and his cane in the other and he just

whack whack whack whack whack whack

whack and then takes one in the back and

then after taking one in the back he

just sort of free adjusts his shoulder

blades you hear some of the cracking of

his spine and he turns around and says

is that all you've got

oh this guy's awesome - I was like Worf

he says Heinz I can feel the poison

coursing through my veins and

and they all seem a little bit taken

aback and then it is the adjutant's term

yes

so the adjutant just turns on her heel

and brings so it is so strict so you're

out here

yeah I'm Asterix and the other yeah

Streisand do throw together yeah you are

you just I'm like snuck around and it's

like hey yeah like mom arm yeah right

and you can see there are like ripples

around them like they're not meant to be

together run the to like them almost

like that that's that force you feel

like when you have two magnets right

yeah so this is what your fiendish eyes

real yeah exactly so as she she just she

takes all this into account and begins

to mentally imagine what she will do

with the glory she earns from destroying

the last lacasa oh that's quite good

[Music]

okay that's quite good humans for him

yeah oh wait yeah I back you up real

quick do I still have a thing she every

spell hey let's see we do with first one

okay I'm taking everything I can get

right now

no no no that's legit legit wisdom at 16

right 16 yeah yeah oh there you go not

good enough not good enough and quite

good so the second is sort of the first

attack she like audibly grunts as she

she turned on

yeah exactly you know why she can if she

history right over she turns at

districts incorrect cuz I did attacker

which ended the sanctuary spell oh yeah

lasting for a while yeah so it's 20

points uncanny dodge but that's the as

the second as the second blade strike

connects with you you just feel like a

stinging weight slipping into the wound

and starting to stretch it's cold

fingers throughout your side so the

first thing is death has another weight

on their shoulders well what I'm saying

is that death has taken an extra 14

points of poison so you are you are up

on this mirrorless shoulder rosy mm-hmm

and she continues to comport herself as

the ultimate immortal martial Paragon

that she is and so every time I have

plus night a hit and his AC is 1819

striking so no no yes yes I got that

when you've got the moon yeah yes okay

so - it's and then the damage from the

Marilyn strikes is no it's quite good

it's 30 points okay I mean she'll

probably whack Rosie with her tail yes I

was just gonna say and then she will she

will like up from behind herself she is

gonna bring her tail up into the air

loosen it a little bit and then snap it

like a whip against her shoulder okay

oof a doof Wow you'd you're lucky you're

lucky so a so yeah we had it's

right we're not done we're an

acquaintance

nine points yeah and then I need you to

make an escape DC 19 was that Frank's

strength or acrobatics yes however you

want to get out of here yeah I'll try

the acrobatics on 19 and square all

right so she snaps you off of her

shoulder huh and then in midair tries to

bring the tail around you like in a

corkscrew sprite like spring spiral and

you are able to slip out immediately

down to the ground

wonderful well that take you away Chris

it's not a fight I'm upset that the

Sangha list has not answered has not

said thank you servant for bringing me

these tasty goods it sounds like it's a

butthole guy

it's a knotted great god Slim Shady yeah

but I will I want to make a wicked mine

contact with Rosie and you're like down

here between these two demons yeah demon

a dental technically they're very vain

but I'm very small yes hello

it's not a great time what's up how are

you doing I call you back

no I need your input okay

I want the same rule is to come down and

and and and consume I need to get his

attention

okay I'm gonna throw one of the stars

but I want you to sign off okay she

looks she looks

this is demon in this devil the Eclipse

and then beyond them they get Eclipse

and then the thousands she says I guess

now's the time to do it

yeah I didn't hear my prayer but it

might know where this happens yeah all

right well maybe just don't hit me all

right

blessings to you okay thanks bye bye see

you later love you

so you so yes I will reach up to my

cloak right locked one of the stars from

it and I will fling it at the at the so

as you as your as you reach up you've

avoided it yes for a long time and so

there's a slight pause at that moment

even with thee even with the direct

authorization because you know that

there is some connection between the

stars even throw on your cloak is it for

the waffle family and the constellation

that is of so much value to Rosie and

her family it's something about this

cloak in that place are connected and in

that moment of pause you fall to the

ground

you now have zero hit points look there

is a voice in your mind very briefly

that says your life in trade so he

collapses face down in the salt eyes the

strange constellations of jewels in his

eyes blinking without any sense and it

is at that time that a spear of amethyst

crystal licks out of the sky apparently

from the eclipse itself and reaches down

and connects itself to the Marylyn

whether he was sucking the poppy

yeah that's what he wanted to do

okay he said there was feasts down dices

it grabs the top of the Marilyn and

twists and the top half of the Marilyn

is drawn flinging Lea into the stars

what does the bottom have to it's like a

it's lame a generic fire hose so I'm

just resting yeah finally well death

safe okay here we go

just resting he died doing what he loved

he's dying

yeah what do I do you roll a d20 and I

get a tenner higher just a flat roll

it's a good point

I think so that's our go the same rule

is one failure all right want to keep

track of that cuz after two more

failures you're dead okay

please don't calculus I'm not going

Chris he's the one that's making these

weird deals Chris is killing Katherine

yes I left

Brett's computer course see all this

transpire I immediately rush over to

Catherine's

and there's so much going on there

really is so much going on in this

moment I don't know whether to just like

keep working on this pic and I don't

have a sense of if I'm even doing any

good or bloody he's bloodied or if I

work on this he flings or if I help

Chris so what's sitting there talking

about how he's all our spells oh no no

so she will kneel down and say and say

you know say stand up and cast healing

word on him for tasty ate it's worth it

I mean that's all he deserves now how

does this will see function eyes flutter

open yeah yeah yeah you're stabilized

for your longer dyeing your hair do you

see anything me uh I say thank you sorry

yeah exactly

no just this this single it's got to go

he's no patron of mine

agreed oh do i oh so she said health in

heaven death word oh no you have death

word Oh what does that do you just would

have been dropped to one hit point but

this was like a weird supernatural yeah

let this occur yeah because I think you

can actually like

forego death warden so it probably was

almost really just read yeah

he's offering his life is sacrifice and

that one HP one that still would've

rushed over any oh yeah yeah okay yeah I

think I stand up I do stand up please

scruff dinar okay

fifteen is no longer fighting a demon

yeah RC is no longer in his face

what how did he react to you know his

combat and being ripped in half

freaked him at it off only for a split

second because his attention was always

on DF okay who is outside so now he's

outside right so you're basically

looking at these big widespread bat

wings and the creature they're attached

to turned away from you and the church

to confront DF outside okay and then

there's still the the T flings there are

eight people in the surrounding ban

Brickton and he's just carrying keeping

them away yeah I mean did I would have

thought like oh your symbols

you've got symbols they've got the same

symbols it's like walking in a barn

someone has the same sports yeah it's

like hey there's a bunch of other people

on a bunch of Oakland Raiders jerseys

but then like a bunch of people in

Oakland your jerseys got stabbed in the

neck which which your hell that worry

how are you I mean you took a big hit oh

you know I'm currently my body got

thrown so I'd like to think that since

my last turn I'm just kind of like

upside down embedded in a wall just like

thinking about my life choices plus he's

thinking I have exactly this many hit

points he's like huh feeling like a like

a twenty six right no no L don't mean is

that high or low is looking California

people can do feeling Minnesota all

right well can I get to him without

getting near this yeah well his face is

he's turned away can i REI so I can

skirt sternal absolutely skirt between

the demon and the teeth wings and all

the other business all right uh I will

try to get over there to any some health

okay

yeah and uh I'll get oh you see there's

some still some townspeople and their

cowered under a bench about three feet

away from where your healing paltin

right now okay so do your heal and I'd

say check this out subscribe to the

newsletter more where this came from

and yeah I'll lay on hands for what's

your max hitpoints I'm max is 62 all

right I'll give you 25 all right keep a

little bit in case I need you bring

something back so some of Halton goons

just disappear in the light and the

town's folk er yeah I'm haste it's also

very Miyagi ash when you doesn't okay I

like get up I'm like you were excellent

security and I thank you for your

services I'll see you to it that you get

a nice little bonus all right you

straighten your cloak paulten and it's

your turn like okay you crack your neck

whoa so how far how far is uh

mister mister pit what's it probably

about 20 feet away okay cool

easily within range so I'm like 20 feet

and I think I'm like I am minus 15 and I

take a roughly large just like step

forward I'm just like that's all I need

and uh you just kind of oh okay and I'm

gonna cast a fifth level thunder wave on

alright and that's a con see how I say

his best times he's - four am I

evylyn is there but palton can basically

hem her out

yeah it's he's determining the business

times if he can sort of catch the devil

on one side and avoid hitting evylyn

you're far enough away okay because you

went around him to climb up onto the the

other team I don't know where the fiend

drop you're good so oh my so he would

have rolled up 20-4 is a sixteen fifteen

okay so he will take half damage and is

not pushed yeah so 68 total 26 okay then

that's before the half that's after

after the half or sorry no nobody around

takes 13 which is an unlucky which sort

of an evil number a little bit Fran Fran

he is still standing after getting

buffeted by this sonic energy washing

over him getting the faith and he just

turns and hold her up like oh wait your

turn

and then it's evil ends turn cool so

everyone's alive seems good yeah awesome

flaming sword time going back no

advantage but bless okay cool so added

deform it oh yeah

how I've done all this divine smiting

how seems to be working yeah how wounded

do I think they are and how how much do

I think the radiance is helping me the

radiance is just pure damage that you're

throwing on top of everything else are

you doing so that the radiant energy is

not in any way being diminished

no and your your instruction always is

gonna connect the light of Lysander to

this radiant damage like this is gonna

be what they impress on you over and

over again okay um what I'm asking is

like do I think I'm gonna have to wail

on them for a really really long time or

my close to finishing them off you're

not sure all you know is that this

creature is like about half worn down

you feel like yeah dad snow left wing

tattered okay so she's like this has

gone on long enough

and she cast and your previous radiant

wound you can see have left permanent

scars on his body sick okay so yeah this

has gone on long enough can she like

with great calm gears up divine smite a

third-level okay so she's gonna it's

gonna take me a second hold on it's a

lot of math and have no orders gosh yeah

yeah

yeah so the Lord plus one because a

fiend 54 I liked I liked in that one was

a full-on overhead like you fly up you

crack him right over the skull with your

sword

there's an explosion of radiant energy

and he says telepathically well back to

the nine hells he just collapses at your

feet into a smoldering pile of black his

mace

climb-climb-climb lands on the ground

and its fire goes out no it's as big as

your house it's evil it's also just

horrible just checking I have a second

attack you have a second target you see

an armored woman with black feathered

wings confronting d/f

that's tricks and oh yeah I'm not

looking good that does not make even

happy are they within 30 feet away yeah

yeah it's right around the corner so she

after flicking the blood off she's like

all right coming at it would they

oops sorry that was an 11 I promise you

have a disadvantage

on your attack no watch you are under

the Eclipse Oh bless so that's only at

12 mmm what that sensation

that's right attack oh right sorry blow

up 20 oh yeah so mommy daddy's gonna

connect okay cool yeah again with the

divine smite at third level she's

feeling herself so and no fire the timer

she too is immune to fire okay cool uh

you like it there need to provide

average damage for evil ins that needs

to be in the Monster Manual that's three

ones okay 41 what was already dude

Lysander is a good guy an awesome God he

reigns with wisdom power and love did

you cropping we all grew up with Jesus

I'm sorry but that's gonna take me a

second to recover I'm stunned it means a

very specific phrase yeah exactly

so yeah you you are able to you are able

to find a place to place this attack

that has the effect you're looking for

even in even though this person is

clearly just a tower of black metal

you're able to you're able to slice into

the tender part of the word in here

mm-hmm right underneath thank ya Jesus

what just happened oh no it's okay she

also says something to the effect of

like don't hurt my friends sort of like

behind her you can hear an odd sort of

shuffle step on the street it's like too

soft too soft

sandals contact followed by a loud from

a stick and the voice says yes yes des

Liza that is sufficient and instead of

readying her weapon she kneels and as he

passes he pass her on the shoulder and

she descends

straight through the ground and the hole

that she leaves through through this can

be heard an eternity of wailing Souls

and the the man carefully steps around

the hole and continues continues walking

a bit until he reaches the pit fiend and

he looks down and he pokes the pit

fiends head a couple times with the

stick and said it says nice work I was

waiting for this to happen it took you a

while but we got there didn't we and

when he whirls in place the creature you

see before you is not the crazy old man

not the crazy old man but an

immaculately dressed sharp featured

gentleman with a Ruby rhod sort of

casting his eye on all of the

destruction around him and he says he is

he is out back around this church so he

can see you and he can see Strix and he

can see deaath and he says I'm sorry how

rude of me

you see if the the golden tarnish on the

shattered that when the steeple was

ripped off the great Bell the Golden

Bell is there you can see that it just

becomes blackened in his presence in

stir rust and then the lit below begins

to crumble and brittle slightly he says

you've heard of me Asmodeus no no no

wait when the name is spoken you see the

fiends in the sky overhead just explode

into pieces no none of this none of this

I have very sensitive ears they get

longer

now now I have machinations

I have schemes I have plans

on the fry material designs even so to

speak it seems like he's having a

conversation with himself does seem that

way says stress dear you can't be

together the relationship that you have

cannot exist it can't exist and have the

prime aterial exist also you knew it

perfectly well it's a relative or you

should have it's a very straightforward

proposition walk away walk away

I have intimate knowledge of the

familial contract that maintains this

peace I am not unreasonable for a god I

am open for business if any of you

clever mortals have a solution to this

problem I'm ready to hear it

but my patience has limits

I have several suggestions Strix

she's like shaky you go to another plane

now from Deus forever problem solved

we keep the prime material my schemes

maintain their momentum what your two

families cannot coexist they cannot be

one that's their problem it's not come

together you said you're familiar with

the contract in buying all the contracts

have words have by lights

to have terms contracts can be rewritten

and broken that's true no no no no no

broken I think not but I passed surely

there is always room within the language

for interpretation then consider this

negotiations I'm not leaving her then

you need to give me something better la

casa and Skiz --ax of those families

that is intriguing

what if they simply renounce what shape

would it take paladin

well we're known by our souls not by our

names and so why can't a soul become

part of a new family if they choose hmm

and who would take such Souls well

Theatre don't have families while

they're doing this just to make just to

like proof or point Strix does life

transference on DF and gives him I get

16 plus 16 plus double 16 at points and

see that's exactly the thing we're

talking about are you my dad no okay

unlikely though you are mother to many

Rosie be stinger or should I say

grandmother night no what we don't wait

be part of anyone's family as long as we

don't have to leave please we'd have our

own family already

thank nicly a family I don't care what

you say or what you call me or Weber's

inside me my entire life I have been DF

Woodrow and I will continue to be DF

Woodrow

not if the multiverse ends they could be

part of my family tell me more

well our rosy feasting your mother to

many as you mentioned indeed you have

done much work for me in the past either

by name or by not now you're thinking of

someone else for more at my table and

once you become a bee stinger your

previous family ties are cut usually net

is lonesome and Rick didn't come out and

throw three tiefling heads on the ground

just sees a guy what if we pledge

ourselves to a new family right now and

create our own that's not how families

or note ok martha aceptas either one

tell me more

when children become my responsibility I

take on their burdens I take on their

happinesses their tragedies those all

become a part of who I am and I think

that you could agree that I am equal to

the task of carrying this burden hmm I

do believe she has a point

mm-hmm well she's not weekly these other

babies as maybe now certainly the

question remains are they smart enough

to take this offer or do we need to fall

back to other plans we may have to go

with contingency plans this really is

their last shot well

death Woodrow Strix it appears we have

found a loophole one or both of you must

leave your Clemen the only way to do

that is for another to take you in and

this one has potential I can see many

sequences of outcomes the Skiz external

and there's a bunch of them I don't

matter

just let me I'll do it you're welcome

there's no moral or kapha apparently

please if it simplifies things you could

both join my family it may make things

weird I understand here mortals ever

well they say that's not theirs no they

think say no no but I really I thought

that was common real you're saying no

right that's that's what I'm gonna I'm

gonna talk to globe Bob Ulis when I get

down there he's good he gave me some bad

info in the meantime we can add we can

append this for the existing con oh of

course

but we'll need will need grandmother

night to kiss the rod to finalize it

well of course there are rules after all

you've got this Ruby tipped scepter sure

it's an immaculate piece so you think it

is also possibly the symbol of his

office and also a significant symbol of

his power

grandmary it's only a kiss and this is a

kiss is not a contract but it's very

nice you've done much much more Oh much

much less okay

and if Strix were to accept this deal

should be freed she would no longer be

of the Skiz exsist she would be of well

which means they wouldn't be able to

keep chasing after her or they wouldn't

have any reason to I just don't want to

leave and the multiverse could keep

spinning merrily oh all of my kids

almost all of my kids are on the

Material Plane so you are you would be

very safe today even just kind of like

tries to speak justice tricks and she's

like remember that is is there any power

of yours that comes from being skittish

and are you willing to give that up I

don't know is there I won't give up

anything to stay she smiles and she's

like my thoughts yeah probably something

bad will happen

just cuz this is just too easy a

negotiation yeah thank you super super

evil I know like being evil like not

only the best for everyone

that's not true I don't want the best

for everyone in the multiverse but for

everyone here consider me a friend

an ally oh that's bad that's terrible

news that is terrible news I came here

to help you as much as to help me wait

that's not what does this give you it

allows me to continue my plans you've

already heard these interruptions

okay so Strix B singer do you know your

paladin sent it to me alone bonkers

right now do you he extends the rod yes

alright Rosie

Rosi approaches the rod with reverence

and he turns a little you see the whole

labor form you start to hot and a little

bit of light shines off of the Ruby on

the tip of the rod

all right great beautifully then Rosie

makes eye contact with thousand Deus and

says this better not bite me in the ass

literally or figuratively you understand

of course understood all right she

kisses it you feel something you feel

this or something separation from a

piece of the cosmic multiverse that just

sort of it's not unpleasant oh it feels

like a an ageless a burden that has

weighed on you since you were a child

and I'm like an unconscious bird yeah

has just sort of been flicked off I was

scared

yeah some of your fear is just gone I

don't know what to say probably terrible

in its own way

yeah and even more than that despite the

entrails hanging on the walls and other

things in the name is chronic you gain a

sudden appreciation for just kind of the

beauty of the world that you never saw

before

yeah as a deer says see isn't this how

it should be people helping people

Oh God God do not like the look I've

Ralph like he's a business does then no

more business does that to a man it's

all good how this know this problem

appears to be completely gone so that

you know no contract worries oh

absolutely not Allah I'll have I'll have

my mother subscribe aside and no time

indeed it's a trifle no killers well the

mercy killers are the mercy killers

after all I can't go to sigil myself or

I would talk to them personally for you

you know how it is

I think maybe we made a bigger enemy

than Asmodeus

you know I was just saying that allow

yeah I'm not sure enemy you're

everyone's enemy you're the big big evil

bad super the biggest blood there is we

spend so much money on press and this is

all Town Criers for a while we had those

words we give and we give it's terrible

why am I not afraid because there's no

reason to be your world just got much

better wait who's one got worse oh

that's not important oh good I want to

take a moment to thank everyone for your

service this day we'll send somebody to

clean up the mess indeed I have every

faith that things are going to turn out

just fine Sonny yeah in fact yes at the

end of the game that's the end of the

offense tricks end by just holding each

other and crying yes yes absolutely

strikes ball hog dear she's not a frame

you know as the Sun basically as the as

the Eclipse is gone completely here in

the open part of this church in the

ruins of it Strix and Deus embrace yeah
