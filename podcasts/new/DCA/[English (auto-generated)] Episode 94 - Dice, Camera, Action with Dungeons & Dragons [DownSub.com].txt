hi I'm two dice camera action a D&D game

that's just alright we're all gonna cry

sometimes we roll dice and sometimes

those dice betrayus and and sometimes we

betray ourselves

I'm not blaming the controller this time

I'm Chris Berg and as a dungeon master

and I'm going to recap very quickly what

has happened thus far the waffle crew

left port nyan Xaro aboard a sloop

called the brazen Pegasus a very Swift

ship which headed into the Bay of Kult

the waffle crew used a explosive device

to blow up a dragon turtle and also send

a shockwave and a real wave washing over

port and ions ro in their wake as they

headed out into open sea they were beset

by a storm they encountered two storm

Giants perched on rocks that were

casting spells and mistook these storms

as a hostile threat and Strix and palt

encounter spelled their magic the

supporting the Giants attempt to quell

the storm and what didn't what ensued

was the series of mishaps shall we say

that ended with several characters in

the water being rescued by the Giants or

by their merfolk allies evylyn got a

nice merfolk of it so it wasn't all bad

and long story short everybody made it

back on board the ship which was only

very very superficially damaged however

the ship lost its captain and the first

mate a older man named Greg Redell took

command and so six days of the 30 days

voyage have passed it is now day 7 and

on day 7 Strix you feel something sort

of ruffle in your hat

stretch soulless like like throw the Hat

off really fast like it's on fire like

but it's not a fire by this time the

crew have basically ignored your started

doing all your tantrums fair yep fair

yeah so throat but then she'll like like

pick it up and just like stick her hand

in and find that there is a letter yes

well press acquisitions incorporated

font letter addressed to evylyn and so

she'll just pick it up and like first

shall look around to see if DF is there

so he doesn't see where is DF on day

seven it's it's a cloudy windy day great

question I would say if he's not inside

whatever cabin is there just real up

near the probably where the cabin is

kind of observing potentially trying to

learn anything he's seeing there or just

off in the distance you thought you

thought paying attention okay super say

he's hopping about that I think you may

find evylyn like laying on a deck which

is not too weird because you know she

loves to soak up the sunshine I imagine

there's probably some sunshine out at

sea but you it's like a rare sight to

see evil and she's kind of just like

flat on her back and she's like tossing

a javelin up into the air and catching

it right in front of her face a bunch of

times just like toss catch toss catch

and you you she looks deep in thought

what Gary her role for that during ideas

like pouting spells where he's just out

of it I'd like to think Paulding is

sitting across from just like throwing

pebbles at his face okay and I

definitely failed so one of the javelins

it probably does hit her in the yeah

okay yeah as you can see that she's

administering some lay on hands to her

face great

shuffle just shuffle up and I imagine to

just being at sea like she doesn't have

all of her stuff on she's only just

wearing like her under like just like

her under a robe dress thing social just

shop

openly handed sewer it's very very like

suspiciously like she'll just do it

it's from Onan dump

he wrote back yes kind of shuffle a

little bit after saying almond and tried

to whisper it but he's like this guy

gets back to his previous position just

about that brief moment I've been be

like she even looks like very intrigued

puts down the javelin sits up like kind

of like Huddle's up with strikes to read

it I assume mmhmm hystrix interested in

seeing it too oh yeah she's definitely

interested in seeing it she's just like

maybe you'll pay us he's my pen pal it's

not about money no I meant in pies so I

mean I do like to open it sort of

delicately or do you just kind of tear

it open she opens it very delicately

because it's like on fancy stationery

and everything there's like a little wax

seal that you have to kind of peel off

without plan it and she like exclaims

over every oh look how pretty

oh it's folded so nice oh then she opens

it up shall I read it yeah it says she

reads aloud dear evylyn please forgive

the rough hand and lesser leaf of this

missive I'm far from home and I have had

many letters to write such that my

stationery kit has found itself quite

depleted oh I don't either but it sounds

fancy

I received your note as regards the

incident at Port neurons are ooh with

some trepidation and my heart was set at

ease to learn that you and your

companions of course had escaped hole as

to your request but the aftermath be

looked into

or perhaps resolved I would consider it

my great pleasure to apply one of my

finest teams to this task team nyah

have you heard of team Maya how you say

no well okay I only know this team I I

don't think that's bad

I'm those aren't stancy - oh yeah we had

Christmas of them I know that I forgot

um anyway Tina I had aboard the Merry

Widow will she goes to the next page set

sail immediately though it may be some

time before they reach that distant

Shore you will receive word of what they

discover on our behalf and the hollow of

Strix is hat soon enough

oh he goes on do you find yourself in

Waterdeep often I would love to invite

you to our headquarters there Tamura in

her grace has allowed me to be her

conduit between this world and the next

and to assist her in the raising of the

dead but you are the first person I have

been honoured to return I find myself

very curious about you and the place

beyond and would love to discuss what

you may have seen there your colleagues

are welcome as well of course though

perhaps d/f may find me too loud I mean

perhaps des may find hidden rancor in

this missive I do not intensity he's

very nasty it just doesn't understand

him answer at your convenience of course

it may be that we were fated only to

meet the one would be a pity why

wouldn't he be maybe you guys just don't

understand him so he paltin you see evil

and do a little twirl with the with the

letter pressed up against her breast do

you like all them just like kind of

stops throwing the pills for a second

looks just like and then keeps throwing

I'd imagine the same time yeah also Kyle

looks over at the same time and then

just while this is going on Halton and

yet you can see that morale on the ship

is still pretty low after the loss of

captain Horta may and captain Redell

disappears from deck frequently and over

the course of the day you see he has

become increasingly drunk you haven't

seen him drinking on deck but every time

he disappears he comes back more red

phased and more tipsy oh is that a local

rep Alton that's fine right this is fine

that's how sailors work I was like I'm

gonna get to the bottom of this respond

like yeah okay yeah that sounds like a

good idea I'm gonna I'm gonna what was

his name again

captain Radel captain Radel I mean I

approached her down and be like sir may

I have a have a word yeah he turns to

you and you can see that he sort of has

to choke down to some vomit can't can't

help but notice that our our captain has

been disappearing and returning

significantly more inebriated are you

holding up okay I'm fine mmm I think I'm

gonna need to confiscate whatever it is

you're partaking it doesn't seem safe in

this situation and I think it's for the

best your hair my guest miss this is my

ship now I gave the orders you can make

an insight check

yeah doesn't count doesn't count

accounts okay not in my country that is

a 12 okay you can see that he's his

bluster is obviously the the drink

talking this is not this is out of

character for him that's as much as you

know he's usually pretty soft spoken and

easygoing okay can i and then he changes

his mind says okay come with me all

right

very good sir we're going and he kind of

looks up and around looks up around out

to the sea we're going down I'm just

like and you start stumbling toward the

stairs makes his way down the stairs

into the dark hollow depths of the ship

and he takes you into a small cabin that

he's been sleeping in you can see a

hammock and he pulls a wall panel off

and you can see he's got a secret stash

a small closet space full of all kinds

of things not just bottles of wine and

casks of ale but other things he's sort

of personally accumulated in his many

voyages and he hands you a half empty

wine bottle here it's the best jackpot

takes as like this will be kept safely

and distribute it to you when seen fit

we don't want you going too far or

relying on you keep this between you and

yourself done and he says sometimes I

lock up and sometimes they don't but

when I do here's the key yes sir

I will not let you down he's between you

and myself I mean you're safe

yes us ourselves in you absolutely okay

and then you can see he just sort of

falls into his hammock and falls asleep

after he does that I'm done holding it

together I just look at the secret door

I'm just like I just like tuck the key

away and lock it up and venture off okay

okay I think

evylyn is just like nagging at strix

like has one corner of her rove and it's

like he wants to know what I saw but I

don't remember anything should I tell

him that I don't remember anything does

that I lack I don't tell him that I'm do

you think he wants to hear from me even

if I don't remember is it just a

religion thing I think he's not really

interested in do you think he won't does

he actually want us to come as he just

being polite meanwhile meanwhile so

after palton falls him down and does all

of that at the same time death will

approach one of the crew members and say

to him is is this this normal just a

usual thing here you talk to one of the

senior crew members a man yeah aalayam

Jairus car and he tells you that this is

not normal at all I mean captain Redell

does drink but he's always been pretty

pretty responsible about it but

obviously he's not taking or Tamizh

death well they were really good friends

but also he tells you a lion tells you

that I Rudel is terrified of Lady Rosner

a lately but he says lady s fillet

Rosner she's the owner of the ship and

she and captain Orton a were longtime

friends and cohorts oh I thought the

captain was the owner of the ship no

lady lady Roger honor is a noble woman

who lives in water deep we have to tell

her Adele doesn't know how to tell her

says a lion

right and do you think he fears her

wrath or just hurting her or the the

Rajan ours they are a intimidating

family captain or ma was never

intimidated because of her friendship

with Eze valet but Radel never enjoyed

that confidence right so I guess this

whole ship is more of a a investment for

her yeah okay thank you Andy its what

kind of return to his post but okay

where he's been you see one of the other

crewmen overheard your conversation and

sort of scolds aalayam privately for

sharing matters of the ship with the

passengers and they get in they get into

a bit of a verbal sparring match a

symptom of the bad morale if the morale

was really bad could I maybe try and

like find some hardtack and like maybe

make some like something with it like a

pie hardtack pie yeah I don't know yeah

you can you can sort of dig around

through the stores okay and see what you

find when you do you see as you sort of

uncrate some of the crates that somebody

forgot or neglected to pump all the

seawater that spilled over the ship and

it's been sitting these crates have been

sitting in the seawater now for days and

a lot of the food supplies have gone

rotten and there's mold running rampant

through everything that upsets

strix very much you're not even sure the

crew has detected that this is a problem

you

means likely they won't have enough food

Thank You Barristan I agree great day 10

a Sal Westar a storm from the southwest

bears down on the brazen Pegasus as it

swoops around the peninsula of velum

continuing its northern journey you are

ahead of it at this point it is behind

you and you can see the crew is doing

its utmost to try to stay ahead of it

does it seem like we're succeeding at

that or yes for now it seems like it's

not gaining much on you at all once

tricks is gonna be on the side of the

ship with her staff turned into a

fishing pole trying to catch fish oh

great

in that case just make oh I mean no

magic fishing pole magic vision is it

magic fishing thing probably not this is

your staff turned into a fishing yeah

yeah okay in that case you are actually

able to catch a bunch of fish you catch

nothing you catch a nine fish holy crap

yeah it's awesome and they're just sort

of flopping around on the deck great um

I will somehow make a safe fire and cook

them for everyone okay when you pick up

one of the fish it says to you I am an

agent of elminster in the Forgotten

Realms continue to watch the streams for

more clues and remember leave no stone

unturned

hashtag no stone unturned and

and then a glyph materializes above the

fish and then the fish goes silent as as

soon as it goes silent can paltin just

like grab the fish and just like bite

its head off yes yes you do yes palton

is just gone gone gone by the way okay

3c Bend mm-hmm as the sailors okay I'm

assuming this fish wasn't really talking

as just me but I was the half of the

body back you notice over the rest of

you notice over the course of the the

three days of the past two that palton

and Captain Radel have kind of fallen

into this rhythm of supporting each

other's bad habit

sharing sharing this hidden trove of ale

and wine as they are this is like very

noticeable yeah all right there are

times when the captain's fine and he's

lucid enough to give orders and stuff

like that but then he sort of usually in

the mornings and the evenings he sinks

into this despair and then palton is

usually there riding on his shoulder or

arm and they're drinking together as

such even does not seem to like the

captain very much kind of scales on him

yeah so you use your magic to cook up

some fire there Strix since there's not

really a stove on board yeah yeah and

you start to skillet fish with you're

turning your fishing pole into a frying

pan right exactly and so I'll cook the

fish and then bring one to bring a whole

fish to halt it and without but mostly

without words just because they're so

upset know what to say so she's just

gonna give them food she doesn't know

how to fix anything Paulding takes the

fish he's just like oh you have this

fire under control that's good Partin

I'm happy for her he looks like trying

to comfort her and she goes below deck

that is a compliment I don't see the

problem here soft you see soft cloud

tears floating above alone this one

problem that's pretty up doctor

even runs after Strix to try to calm her

down and leaves death and walking

together okay he responded yet he's like

the cool thing about that though is they

didn't ask so you have yourself a lovely

day and he just passes out you're such

an sometimes just like no

arguing yeah

DF you are now alone with the crew on

the deck of the ship

the winds billowing the sail where's the

captain at this point you can see that

he is asleep behind the wheel

oh my god sort of he's sort of hanging

on it and kind of exactly how he should

be to keep the ship steady DF this

didn't seem like any of the rest of the

crew even sees this right now they're

perfectly aware okay but he's the

captain so they can't tell him anything

and D ethyl just say something look oh

well just kind of like i lovely

addressed the entire crew to saying you

guys you don't see you as a problem

right and none of your doing anything

they all kind of turn away and go back

to tightening their ropes and Wow

alright deaath we'll go over there and

then if he's the captain's like passed

out drunk he is currently passed out his

weight just sagging on the wheel alright

DF let Scott take them and just kind of

lift up in and then death will

just kind of like hesitantly put his

hands on the wheels like alright you did

this before and just be like alright I'm

not great at this but it's better than

nothing I could just

Skyler see you tonight justjust take us

[Music]

[Laughter]

just avoid that train yeah so he says

just just take us North by Northwest

we'll be fine all right I'll do that

just I need your help well I'm doing the

best I can and then Diaz will just kind

of like awkwardly trying to take the

wheel just like hold it steady as much

as possible like I said if someone says

oh that's right that's the direction

then he's just like good it's good news

very like just kind of anxious of kind

of screwing up or just making sure like

he's holding it tight and keeping the

ship on course yeah okay when you go

down below deck evylyn look for Strix

Strix where are you hiding in gaseous

form like under the stairs closet yeah I

think under the stairs sounds about

right and she definitely just looks like

she's crying because she's still in

gaseous for him I'd say she would have

materialized she only does it for

dramatic effect

Evelyn sits down cross-legged in front

of her and doesn't even touch her like

usually you know even when super touchy

but she's like she's really trying to

comfort its tricks so she sits down and

she's like I'm really sorry that was I

was really mean you didn't deserve that

she kind of like looks up at evylyn with

like tears at her as if she's like I did

deserve it doesn't it's my fault that

everyone hates me and she's just like

crying go hunting on the ground

she she's she like tries to reach Shiki

even by nature keeps like reaching out

to touch her and then being like oh no

that's not what she wants so she's like

no you I I don't hate you you hear a

clump clump clump coming down the stairs

and you see a shadow sort of cast upon

you and then a figure comes around the

bottom of the stairs and it is Simon oh

and he just holds out your frying pans

tricks like he's giving it back to you

Oh Simon doesn't hate you either Simon

you're not mad at Strix are you no see

usually usually you dart me after this

day twelve what a hug do you want a hug

from salmon Strix you want a little

Simon huh

it's away day twelve DF make a charisma

check just flower charisma yeah okay

I'll give you advantage thirteen okay on

day 12 two days have passed since you

took the wheel the crew is starting to

defer to you captain da heck you've

you've persuaded them that you're

probably best equipped to to stay on the

wheel you seem to be a natural at it and

they will they seem much more upfront

with you and they talk to you and they

sort of guide you tell you things that

you need to know about you know the

course the ship is on things like that

you've left Belen behind you and you're

heading north by northwest up the sword

coast you will pass by you'll pass by

continue your northward journey on this

day hi Minsk okay

so I guess during this like deaath still

doesn't and they'll periodically relieve

you though also okay cool yeah yeah EF

does not having enough nautical training

to be able to properly command people by

any means yeah or really make informed

decisions by any kind but they they at

this point they see you like a member of

the crew and they treat you as such and

actually their morale has

improved slightly sweet Strix has been

catching fish too hopefully that helps

that morale yeah totally and least for

now after after this is day two of

eating fish if death is a death is

outside a lot holding the wheel he'll

like you have a shirt off a lot and then

because he's doing so much work he's

probably getting real ripped - yeah

[Music]

lagdi it's like like steering and stuff

like alton today just like kind of like

stumbles out a sees the all this morale

he's just like it's all it's a big round

of applause for new captain moody ass

we're all counting on him right good I'm

like trying to get everyone to be like

yeah but that's mutiny says Redell

standing behind you and then as soon as

I hear that I just like duck out Rudel

staggers around and sort of says where

is this war this Cod who would call

himself captain we lost Dana for a

second she's out back I'm sure yeah just

pretend she's staying with Anders yeah

the crew is like nobody's know you're

the captain your ears

yeah it's like well we're still captain

and we're just trying to help out make

sure we get home that seems to satisfy

him

great no one has actually called me

captain right no okay cool yep

at one point those tricks will

definitely make some kind of like

captain style hat out of things you can

find I'm like like presented 2d it's

like all proud of her softly it looks

like one of those paper boats do me and

green it says captain Oh what she gives

that to D if he'll actually Beach guy

like oh this is cute and you'll actually

like take it and kind of like wear it a

little bit you realize that that the

wind easily sort of catches it so maybe

I'm not a strap to it yeah you had a

chinstrap now okay that actually gives

the crew a much-needed laugh hey not at

your expense yet but that there's yeah

yeah yeah his debt still like steering

right now on and off yeah okay

I like I'm gonna approach him like while

he's behind the wheel if he currently is

yes I just like cos stumble over I put a

hand on shoulder I'm like look I know

what I said the Strix was mean and oh

you and me we don't get along that well

all right carry on doesn't know what

that does have a response for that it's

because it wasn't anything strikes is

gonna be scared of paulsen now by the

way every time she sees palton she's

like she like walks away like she's

gonna do something wrong or she's just

making his life harder he's like walking

by her and like starts to take notice

and like like looks strikes is just like

this is a fun new element and the

Simon's just standing there shaking his

head you can see that a lot of the fish

is is being eaten by waffles so she

never seems to get bored of the fish

days I don't think we'd give her a live

one just like that around oh absolutely

and she can kick that around the deck

and chase it around and she throws it up

in the air and toss it around she she

makes a whole big game out of it and

again it's also lightens the mood day 17

captain Radel has basically almost

poisoned himself on the amount of

alcohol he drinks and suddenly stops Wow

like he just can't take it anymore he

turned him he turned green the night

before and looked like he might not make

it through the night when the morning of

the 17th on the 17th day comes you can

see he can't even look at a wine got a

wine bottle let alone drink from it a

man after my own heart I don't know how

you can do it you'd be surprised how

much pain can help that poor landlubber

I don't see don't you start loving me I

barely even know you but I do feel like

we've become very close through this

whole thing I'm more clear-headed today

than I was yesterday and I not sure

you're right well we can change that and

he just like tries to hand him one OK he

just turns away and and just spews over

the edge of the ship captain party fell

over here great it's like I'm fishing

grouse that night

d/f captain Oradell comes over to you

and thanks you for stepping up and

helping the crew out in this difficult

time and he also says he's very grateful

that strikes also was able to counteract

the problem with the the poisoned food

stores yeah of course

yeah Strix yeah you're welcome just

trying to help out I was wondering if

you could help me in one other way

I'll try I'm not very very good this

whole thing but I'm listening

this doesn't have anything to do with

the ship per se well it does have

everything to do with the ship actually

the owner of the ship is a woman named

as valet Rosner she lives in water deep

event Oh whoo what captain Quartermaine

was her friend and I fear that news of

Ottomans loss is going to be greeted

poorly I would ask that you speak to

lady Rosner on my behalf and relay my

condolences in the hopes that perhaps

she can see that this was beyond our

abilities to prevent I can face a storm

i can face a frakkin I can face a Sahu

again

assault but water Davian Nobles they are

an entirely different monster yeah tell

me about it on behalf of you and honor

of your entire crew this is yeah I can

absolutely talk to her for you

this is the very least that we could do

you see a great burden sort of lifted

off him

and he he just sort of grabs you by the

shoulders and smiles warmly through his

salt big bushy salt-and-pepper moustache

and beard

you see crooked yellow teeth smiling for

the first time you've ever met him and

then he goes off and starts barking

orders like everything's fine now can

you guys hear me yes yep okay well

welcome back my entire place just lost

Internet so here yeah all right

so in while you were gone

we're on day 17 now Anna the crew of

fish but they don't let it on because

they don't they know Strix is kind of

like a fragile vase and I don't want to

send her back down under the stairs for

like the 13th time oh yeah she's been

going down there all the time there's

probably like a tear-stained but every

time they see her fishing off one off

the port side or the starboard side you

can just see it in their eyes that they

another another fish dinner is just

gonna kill them they'll eat it cuz you

know they got nothing else right now

but yeah I think as far as like what

Evelyn's been up to she's she's been way

more distant than usual she's doing a

lot of that javelin passing and thinking

to herself but if she runs into Strix

she's like it's been real nice that

you're providing fish for everyone I

think they really like it

stories like that one likes what I do

but it's fine at least it's keeping

everyone alive why are you so mean to

yourself I ruin everything I don't think

that's true you died Simon died

everyone's died palton is mad DF is

broken or bad or whatever seems fine

since he's you know

since I got the Hat the crews talking to

him got that promotion she's like maybe

the Hat did help I'll just make you more

hats I don't think that I don't think

that they're mad because of you though

nope also definitely is well what do you

think he's mad because he doesn't

understand what's going on

and I guess honestly I don't either I

don't understand anything I don't

understand why we do any of this why do

what you do it I don't know she's just

like looking around like like there

should be something like that would make

sense like right in front she's like I

don't know there should be something

here but it doesn't make any sense I

know what you mean I feel like I don't

know I have this weird feeling like I I

know what I'm supposed to do and what's

right and yet there's like a whole

nother voice inside me that is saying

something different and I don't know

where it came from it's like when I came

back to life I was two people do you

ever feel like that

she strikes is so just like overwhelmed

by what she's saying she's like like and

she looks at evil and she goes I don't

even know if I'm one person let alone

two people and she just walks away

it doesn't reveal very sad being left

alone uh-huh it does occur to you all of

you over this long journey that since

the death curse lifted you've it's

dawned on you multiple times over this

voyage that you know the smell of the

fresh air and the the sort of health and

Hale hearty feelings you feel is kind of

knew you'd suffered under the death

curse for so long it was sort of tearing

you away physically now you seem to be

kind of back to your normal selves DF

you've been you know on a steady fish

diet and working out tremendously on

this ship so you feel pretty good

compared to the last several weeks

months yeah physically physically anyway

yeah day twenty you hear one of the crew

members shout flotsam

I don't know that means you can see he's

pointing off the starboard side of the

ship where you can see what appears to

be wreckage floating in the water ahead

and Diaz just like avoid that we're

avoiding that avoid - okay you sort of

Bank toward port coming alongside the

wreckage and well looks through or to

Mays spyglass to see if there's anything

of consequence yeah

actually as we're kind of going on it

almost in a uncharacteristic moment for

DF his entire time he actually kind of

gives an order and ask the crew to slow

down and check the wreckage trying to

get tried to examine exactly what

happened here if they were like attacked

or just shipwrecked or whatever yeah and

potentially see if there's any remaining

useful supplies is their well-being

captain does it does it look like

there's anywhere to like stand on the

wreckage or is it just like pieces you

kind of look out and it's a it's a

little bit foggy so it's hard to tell

but if you were to like say borrow

captain Rodell spyglass you could

probably get a better sense I would like

to just be like here I got this and if I

may sleep it sure and just take a look

yeah he doesn't protest as you look out

you can see that there is there are some

floating crates a floating barrel and

pieces of scattered timber all around

you could certainly appear a topic rate

or a barrel it would be unsteady I might

try I'm just be like alright let's see

what's down there I don't want a

dimension door over Bance

he disappears from the deck of the ship

through a magical go away parity saving

for upon arrival does that call over

Strix and evylyn okay seventeen

all right you appear on top of a crate

and you Bob there and you managed to

stay it sinks a little bit under your

weight and there's some sloshing of

water over your hands and feet and knees

but you are on

kneeling on this crate now standing amid

the wreckage make a perception check who

19 through the mist you can see that the

crates don't look like that they're

necessarily they they look like that

they've been sealed with pitch so

they're probably not flooded and the

barrels likewise and there's obviously

they're obviously light enough to float

on the water but you also see what

appears to be half of a jolly boat a

rowboat likely you'd find on a ship that

they use for getting to shore but it's

only like the half the front half of it

so it's floating and there's something

in it and it appears you can hear

snoring and you can see big boots

sticking up at the broken off end like

the weight of this creature is keeping

the broken off section up high enough

that this half of a ship can basically

float how far is that half of the ship

sort of drifting in the fog about 30

feet away from you okay I want to kind

of doing lazy circles as the current

sort of comes up and down underneath

well I want to so I can't run so I'm

only like seeing boots I'm not seeing

like correct in it yeah you the the

sides of that jolly-boat are high enough

and the what whoever it is a sleeping in

there and prone you can't see who it is

until you get closer to the ship is they

based on the size of the boots which are

like a size 22 mm-hmm this is not a

small person okay Johnny largeman over

here all right is there like a plank or

something I could grab and like maybe

like row my way over yes

cool the rest of you see palton fish out

a plank and start to rode towards

something in the fog the ship at this

point has sort of slowed and done

exactly what DF wanted

I had called over Strix and evylyn yeah

they're there that drink all that so by

the time they get over there

death will turn to them and just like

Strix evylyn go over there sorry what

Canyon

evylyn do you think do you think you

could go over there and see if there's a

can you check the supplies maybe there's

something useful do you think it'd be a

good idea to get some hi captain

and then he'll turn this trick to be

like Strix can you uh she's making his

face ball time Strix it would be helpful

you would really help me out if you

could uh maybe you could see what

happened to the ship like see if there's

like magic or monsters or something do

you think you could figure that out

and so like adjust his little hat

[Laughter]

alright so even when you fly out with

your wings and stresses off on her broom

by which time palton you have rode your

way over to this thing and you see what

is asleep in the boat is a wearing sort

of a wrinkled uniform with shiny black

boots a hippopotamus man ah he's ever

would stand if where he's standing he'd

probably be about seven and a half eight

feet tall probably broad and his uniform

if you'd call it that is all sort of

wrinkled from having been in the salt

water and wet and everything but it's

mostly it's a little it looks a little

bit damp but dry right it looks like

it's drying out and he is sleeping

soundly you can see that his hands are

so big that they could pretty much just

sort of cover your whole head

and I'm assuming I've never seen

anything like this before you can see on

his uniform he's got some medals pinned

to it can I can I do like a history or I

guess it would be and I don't know a

planar check guess this thing isn't from

here what would that be history that

would be make a Arcana gosh make it

harder make an arc on a check okay

that's I yeah Isis arcane 24 okay and

palton you see tricks go over her head

on her broom leaving a cloud of smoke

behind her she looks down upon the

figure in the boat evil and you are over

there as well fluttering above crates

and barrels sorry you're muted Anna do I

see anything of interest uh with you see

the crates the barrels you don't know

what's in them because they're sealed I

pick one okay that looks like it might

be interesting okay and I assume I can't

like how heavy is it can I carry it

you've got a strength of eighteen right

yeah but I'm burning right you probably

can't but you could drag it I'm just

gonna push it through the water like a

little motorboat all right yeah when you

get it close to the ship they're able to

basically line it in and haul it up

she's just doing like a little story now

yeah whatever that's what does the boat

called that pushes stuff it's not a

tugboat at the barge she's a little

barge just pushing everything alright

yeah so she pushes all the stuff that

looks like it might have contents that

could be valuable or whatever which is

basically like five crates and three

barrels worth of stuff strix you believe

that the creature in the boat is a gif

gif F ah a mercenary hippo folk who are

known to pop up in all kinds of crazy

places alright so I definitely would

have see

sigil at some point probably yes

probably more than one there but rich

and Surfrider's

evil but you've never seen one here in

this world and you never really

associated tremendously with them but

you've heard that they basically are as

true mercenaries sort of in it for the

money and don't have any particular

morals or ethos beyond that so he could

have been hired by someone potentially

yes all right before I like wake them up

I just like look up mr. a some guy

that's weird

well first she's still scared he when

she goes and then she goes oh it's a

it's a gift it's a babe they're hippo

people they dive I would like to look to

the hippo to see if he's woken up okay a

seagull lens on the hippos head oh she's

still asleep

yep I'm just like I just like point at

him I'm just like I cannot if I could I

would like to polymorph this hippo folk

into something that we can carry back to

the show all right so what do you want

to try to polymorph it into uh just you

know maybe just cuz since it's on a ship

and I don't really want it to get away

I'll just say another baby chick okay oh

and the DC is sixteen okay

the spell washes over him but does not

seem to transform him and he wakes up

I see I'm just like hi the sea gull

takes off of course when he tries to sit

up and he says whoa what is going on

here we we've noticed that you were

shipwrecked

and we are here to help which is why

we've already started taking your stuff

onto the boat because we are going to

help I capital has to me capital a

rescue got it

sorts but not to by us madam Oh fear not

Oh we'll be set right I just need to get

back to my fleet just wait wait wait no

no no no

palms gonna couldn't be like um sir we

really do need this information because

we were sent by a party that we also

cannot dispel but we need to see if this

is said same party and I would like to

try and persuade him that we might be

working for

the same people oh sure oh that's an at

20 he says you'll have to talk a little

louder son but and when you do he says

well my fleet has been hired charged to

ensure the safety of this world that is

what we do from threats beyond distant

places the far realm what what I look to

rest of the party I might want that what

you will where were you going he says we

were coursing through the tears of salu

name when our ship was struck you see

our helmsman knocked unconscious

whereupon without the wizard our ship

was caught in the gravitational pull of

the planet and dropped here I I'm sorry

I'm trying to follow we're all just like

the math lady games

what what's a gravitational pull ah

that's a fine question out of my area of

expertise I know one when I feel one did

you send a far realm

yes my mother listens all that nastiness

what about the hell's not the hell's

right or any of those hmm no well at

least we don't deal with those yes we'll

turn to the rest of the crew for a

moment it's big question do you guys

know where we are right now does any of

this sound familiar to any of you

well the tiers of saloon a are the

glittering lights that you see sometimes

in the night sky the Stars yeah yep nose

just wants to make sure that's yeah you

know there wasn't like a double meaning

is a

oh the Stars oh okay he's from the stars

guys he's from the Stars okay okay you

can't just be from the stars where is

this shine pitted water deep splendid do

they have the buses there are people

that are blunderbusses Wow

do they have wonder buses I'm not sure

you've been there for a while how many

times did you drink a blunderbuss that's

a drink right is that a drink no no it's

what do you go firearms do their

firearms you must be a wizard

are you the helmsman of this vessel

wizard like right is like just race

there's the firearms I like just like

kind of push Simon behind me Strix will

remember that the crew will tell him

that they're about ten days out and he's

like walks how what I cannot hear a word

you're saying

he said what'd he say he said we're

about ten days out ah splendid

well I am absolutely famished whatever

you have is good enough

I'll make yourself as useful as possible

don't mind me I'll hand them like half a

bottle of wine it's like this is um this

is a primary he should ignore as you

goes past you and he's just staring down

the thing says My gods this is the

dirtiest deck I've ever seen who's in

charge here pointed yet no Redell sort

of steps in and says that they haven't

had a chance to wash down the deck and

there's been some fish flopping around

on it but don't concern yourself with

that they'll take care of it

yeah and I'll bear poop and you see

Redell tries to take lure the big hippo

man to some place where he can't damage

anything wonderful hey are we we could

do this right I'll be able to take him

on and still be okay on supplies and

stuff what are you thinking those crates

it that evil I found if you want to

finally sort of unpack the crates you

can see that one of the crates contains

a bunch of pouches full of little iron

balls another of the the other four

crates contain one contains bottles of

wine packed in sawdust

oh no one tries to hide this from calton

and the other three contain food that

you never the likes of which you have

never seen weird sort of alien mosses

strips of meat from unknown beasts and

whatnot

so you've got these weird ball bearing

things you've got a line and you've got

three things of meat and other

non-perishable food the barrels you see

[Music]

two of them contain one of them contains

oil one of them contains pitch and one

of them contains water Oh water so we

got water and abundant food this food

strict strict so well rummage around in

there and taste things and yeah when you

do your you're treated to tastes that

you've never experienced oh I'd like

four different pieces in my room later

no Mike it'll work oh all that this is

awesome

well okay look thank you guys did it

don't say yeah imagine imagine how much

more we didn't have to feed a giant

hippo person - well technically is his

stuff I mean we found it so did you

happen to see a floating hearing horn by

chance mm-hmm I feel like it could

really help him and us mostly us

I don't know strix is good at making

things maybe she can make him one all

right pixel set off to

maybe like using like fish bones or

something or like scrimshaw to like find

some way to like maybe fish skin maybe

she can make dry some fish skin out in

the Sun and make a horn we're sort of

wrap it around a frame a bone for

something yeah you could absolutely do

that day 23 the horn is done a pod of

whales swims by the ship as you are

coursing north by northwest Ward water

deep and they they pass by without any

issue and it's actually it's one of the

first clear sunny days that you've seen

but it's crisper and cooler now you seem

to be traveling far enough north that

you've left well left the tropical

temperatures behind and it's becoming

much much colder so when you're up on

deck and the wind it's actually quite

bracing I would puts his shirt back on

I'd like yeah while he's putting a shirt

on to make a perception check 17 okay

what do you guys want to do if anything

on day 23 you're about seven days out

from arriving at water deep according to

the crew members uh we're just hanging

out right like nothing in particular is

going on right at this point in time

warning Tintin it upon himself to

appoint himself first officer and I Todd

you can see that he is enforcing the

captain's commands making sure

everything is shipshape and and

span and all the business all the rest

of it the crew is sort of half

intimidated by the hippo man and half

they find just hilarious so anytime

death like sheepishly says something

Wharton it's like you're the man

any chance Pauling guess he like tries

to sneak up on hippo man just like like

examine him okay just like hey I'm

asleep hey it's so weird he said are you

he says I am a gift

you know what now he says I am a gift I

mean that's pretty high praise for

yourself but alright then

and he says you have magic hahaha

can you press my uniform if the money's

right buddy I can press whatever you

want

I have no currency upon me and he sort

of taps tricks at one point then says I

beg your pardon sweet lady but my

uniform is out of sorts and I have no

means to press it I was wondering if you

could whip up a little spell and set

things right yeah I'll I'll

prestidigitation his uniform alright

when you do it's just all beautiful

clean press and he says a thousand thank

yous this is fabulous

that's funny because she did that and

she just looks like a mess like

everything on her is just like

disheveled she's like hey you're welcome

are you somehow impervious to your own

magic and she's like her hands on fire

and she's like maybe I am I think even

has been looking for a chance like when

death is just hanging out captaining or

something to go just spend some time

with him I imagine he's kind of like you

know if he's the captain he has all

these official duties so he's not just

like hanging out as much so she brought

if he does he steer the ship very

occasionally yeah yeah it's very much a

case of fake it till you make it he's

like kind of steering oh oh yeah just

like uh she comes in like just like

perches on the railing by where he's

steering and she's like hey captain

evylyn how you doing uh gifts what kind

of holding the wheel she's like I'm

oh good look just looking ahead yeah we

haven't gotten to talk very much lately

cuz you've been so busy with you know

like your new important job and

everything and it's not I'm not I'm just

trying just trying to help but yeah

you're right we haven't you're doing a

good job think you were kind of born to

the whole leadership thing uh dia does

not respond are we are we okay he'll

look over at her and be like yeah yeah I

mean we're fine right you're fine

yeah I just I know things got really

weird when we were leaving port nines ro

and I'm I don't know I didn't feel good

about how I acted yeah I could see what

you mean I I was I was scared I I didn't

want you to leave I'm sorry I was rough

about it I don't know I don't know I

probably shouldn't have left either way

but I shouldn't have been like I was

about it yes all right it was a it was a

distressing time for a lot of us and I I

I could I could see the I knew how you

felt I absolutely know how you felt I

mean if do you cuz could you tell me how

you felt I have no idea you just you

wanted to help right you land on the one

hand I know I always know what's right I

know people need help I go help that's

my whole reason for existence I knew

that was what I was supposed to do but

then there's this other side of me that

I don't even recognize that saying no

there's there's more I don't know I'm so

confused all the time lately it's so

well you're right you should want to

help people I always wanted to help

people but I that's why I understand why

you were so torn because I wanted to go

back and help too and fix anything that

I that may have happened I don't

understand why you're so confused right

now are you evil in what what do you

want I mean I know the answer to that

question what is all I want is to serve

Lysander and by the way evylyn you also

suddenly remember his arrests asking you

the same question like in heaven I

remember you don't remember the cotton

you just suddenly as soon as he says

those words those exact same words you

have just the splinter of a memory a

flash of this woman this old woman

saying me asking you the exact same

thing in a serene landscape you don't

remember I think that probably kind of

like hits are in the gut like I think

she kind of hooked you know and then she

looks even more completely lost and kind

of like shakes her head and she's like

ever since I came back it's like there's

two people in my head and one of them

knows who I'm supposed to be and what

I'm supposed to want and then the other

one keeps questioning it and won't shut

up all the time and I feel like there's

something I should know or some I don't

know and I know I know what I was

supposed to do which is go back and I

didn't because I don't know I guess I'm

not as strong as I was anyway I'm sorry

I came to ask how you were

evylyn if I ever hear you ever say that

you are not strong I will punch you so

hard my hand will break yeah I don't

know how else to tell you this you were

the strongest person that I know that's

why I look to you that's why I know that

whenever things are rough

whenever I'm whenever I don't know what

to do that's why I look to you that's

why that's why you're here isn't it I

mean I don't know if that's maybe

selfish thinking but you're here to help

guide us to help guide me I want to

believe that I that I want to believe

that what Paulding said is true

which is that maybe I have a purpose I

didn't understand that's more about this

family than it is about helping every

single person I come in contact with but

isn't it possible that I'm just looking

for excuses

and isn't it possible that I'm strong

till the second he says something that I

can use as an excuse idea that actually

let go of the wheel for a moment and

approach over to eland and kind of get

close to her an opportunity paulten the

wheel kind of walk up to her like hands

on his hips

kind of looking down almost looking for

an answer and just I can't tell you what

to feel or what to want but you know you

know it's not wrong to want things

I mean you've you've told me that before

and I haven't forgotten that and I think

it's

I think you should know it's okay to

want things to what other people want

but what people want you to do what you

feel you should do sometimes what is it

that you want what does all this mean to

you and once you find that take it and

really hold on to it it's something that

I learned a long time ago but what if

what I want means I don't do my duty or

people get hurt d/f left out of a long

sigh yeah sometimes people get hurt even

though you don't want them to how do you

figure all this stuff out I don't always

know what to say

yeah it kind of starts backing up to get

back to the wheel and grab holding it

and he's just like I don't maybe it's

okay just to not huh sometimes it's

better to live without a plan well what

about you though I'm you didn't look so

good back then are you feeling better

now I'm fine

yeah uh gift looks over it Oh we'll look

whatever it's kind of like I have to be

yeah if you don't have to be anything

we're here for you just as much as you

are for us it's unfair not to let us be

uh yeah looks down at the wheel and

looks back straight ahead and just like

I'm steering the ship I'm getting us

home that's what I need to do if you

like down in the ship you can hear just

like yeah it's tricks you uh

you are rather taken with some of the

the dry meat that you've got out of the

crate Warrington tells you at one point

that it is

basically space lampreys fun yeah

and yeah they sometimes attach

themselves to the hulls of ships and so

they're pretty easy pickings and they're

so tasty

paltin you're yes you're on deck

Simon those points to something when you

sort of track his finger make a

perception check

I'll give you advantage because he's

trying to point out to you 19 he's

pointing at a ship that is to stern not

close like out toward the horizon but it

is on the same course as you so like

right as I'll say like right as evylyn

and deaths a conversation and they just

got here those that was lovely guys that

was a good dialogue I am

there's just authors bonds and there's

you just always listening to everything

all the time or less I'm in it for the

character development but that's the

issues though and I'm gonna point out

just like so yeah I don't know maybe

more friendos we can just invite who

knows how far away is this ship it's

very not away okay not it need to see

you need to see it through a spyglass

okay beautiful like finding whatever

crew member whatever I usually has the

equivalent of a crow's nest just be like

yeah there's no crow's nest on this ship

right right it's a smaller one so I

figured you guys like you're basically

on the stern the high stern of the ship

yeah whatever like room numbers name is

he'll he'll call out and be like do you

look at that what is that yeah

Skyler will grab the spyglass he's got

the youngest eyes on the deck on the

ship when he looks he says it he tells

you it's a sloop which is the same kind

of ship as yours a very swift single

sale squared sail ship and built for

speed and to her

pirates mostly but also used for cargo

and he tells you it's flying two flags

one is the flag of the city of zaspar

which is a city on the velum peninsula

which sort of explains why they're kind

of coming from the same direction

did you swing around the Pitts Peninsula

the second flag is gold with a black

winged snake

hard bass okay at this point DF cunning

castaway will say as a head of forest is

it faster than us Redell takes a look

through the spyglass and says that if

they're smart and they can they can ride

the current and catch the wind they

should be able to stay out of it that

ship is not inherently faster than the

brazen Pegasus unless it's got some

magic he doesn't know about maybe it

doesn't though alright whenever we need

to we need to keep going past that don't

let it catch us we don't need to we

don't need to intervene with any of that

just keep moving you're worried about a

ship that's small thanks it's no bigger

than this one Maurine 10 it's not the

ship itself but those standing upon it

do they have any cousins it's probably

several none that will be good for us

I'm really used against us we need to go

there's a lack of weapons on the ship is

what he says nevertheless something must

be done only if they catch us I'm just

like you're right get your ass over

there and you got this we believe in you

you're the strongest most noble lover

you you got this we have as a obvious

but I'm not going to swim that distance

that is buffoonery of the highest

magnitude sir

good words warden you seem to be pretty

good about this and know exactly what

they do if you could look around check

the ship stores or whatever other

supplies we have if it seems like

they're gonna get close maybe you can

come up with a plan to fend them off

excellent thinking ding-dong I shall be

downstairs write that down you didn't

why don't you come help me hmm oh I I

have a standing obligation I've got some

and then he as he saw me he just slowly

turns invisible and descends down the

stairs you can see that he has a hard

time getting down in the ship but he

does it because he likes the suggestion

and you can hear him get stuck at

various points down below hard time just

like by sighs just sheer his size and

and breadth the staircase is not wide

enough for him to navigate down easily

you can actually hear the sound of the

stairs sort of creak deeply as he steps

upon them with his big giant hippo feet

but he does sort of slam around down

there for a while complaining that they

really are no weapons of any kind and

saying that aboard his ship they had six

cannons in the great bombard we have

firearms reports districts yes

day 24 that ship has not gained

measurably but it is clearly following

your same path oh I like just am it I'm

at this point I just like I'm used to it

I look off the back of the ship I'm just

like thrown way back yeah is it still

about a same amount of distances of when

we first saw it pretty much yes okay and

it looks like it's just sort of keeping

that distance the waters have been kind

of

choppy but not there's an you there are

no storms in sight day 27 that ship is

still pursuing at a distance there's

about three days out you project from

water deep at this point you're still

way out into the sea traveling on a

North by Northwest course but you're

closing your just just close enough to

kind of see the coast what is the the

how far is this ship from us roughly

many many thousands of yards over a mile

away

noted

so the second flag that he described did

it kind of trigger a memory where it

sound like I might've been like as

interim flag or yes it is as you catch

sight of the flag periodically you can

see it's definitely the sign of the

centaurum okay cool great can I explain

to a great man that these are bad

Wizards ah yes I know the ilk oh so bad

Wizards bad do you have anything on you

that can stop bad Wizards

he says wizardry is not really a gift

thing you'll see we have no aptitude for

magic that is why we rely on freelance

majors and wizards to come to control

our ships tell me something I have not

yet found a helm on here is this ship

incapable of space travel if you're

talking about going up there and she

points this guy's goes we're not going

up there yes I shall see you after see

about procuring one and what a deep if

the city is of a measure oh I don't

think you're gonna like it

well I'm gonna love it I'm going to like

it excellent oh yeah chef set the bar

high get ready for it get ready for a

great place you got it's gonna go

swimmingly or spacing ly question again

if you were being pursued in such a way

points to the ship how what would you do

as a experienced space faring

hey I would have someone go over there

and conduct surveillance a recompence

mission thank you thank you smart such

spacefaring in whatever Halton you're

the best to do this excuse me I'll go

over there and set the ship on fire and

everything will go terribly wrong and

I'll get captured and D I'll have an

aneurysm and evil and we'll fall apart

again

Longo's no problem I'll just fly over

there on my manda away it's way too far

for dementia Oh what and you can fly on

it while you're invisible I don't know

how to use that thing

it's just it's yours plate and go can I

do this

you'd have to attune to it take like ten

minutes right yeah so is it just like is

it ten minutes of like learning to ride

a bike I'm just like this yeah you

basically have to hold on to it for ten

minutes while the magic becomes part of

you and so that you can command it to do

the things that Strix has been able to

do even aside to the earth is like has

she ever let anyone ride her broom

before sorry praising my count looks out

red even from moments like yeah he says

like oh god no not ever

that's a big deal right I I thinks I

think so you can almost hear like a

twang of a envy or jealousy and yes

voice so am i yes so your tune yeah okay

Astrix is like trying to trying to tell

balton that she's sorry and that she

trusts him I'm sorry that we all try to

kill ourselves

all the time that's not smart but it's

because we all care very much about each

other and I'm sorry that I was a bad

friend and I care about all of you and

that's why I'm handing him my only

precious treasure to go the poems like

hovering it any processes this he's like

I'm still not totally over it but this

is pretty cool

so we're going in the right direction

he's like alright any so if I cast

invisibility on myself that the broom

will be invisible too right yes yes it

well okay cool

so I cast invisibility and Paul is just

like all right ten points Gryffindor

let's go

okay there is a big explosion a bomb as

black smoke surrounds you and you launch

off the back of the ship make an

intelligence check palton Oh 18 okay the

magic about fifteen feet after you take

off into the air the magic of the broom

cuts out and you sort of fall like five

feet but then suddenly you kind of

regain control over it again and you

don't hit the water you stop short of

that and continue to launch yourself

forward so just like she planned it but

you see it's actually kind of bad it the

magic that went into making it you think

was not entirely great and so it is hard

to control it sort of veers to the left

on its own and you have to constantly

kind of fight it to get it straightened

out and every time it backfires there's

this you say all right well this is this

is great this is way less fun that are

invisible the black smoke trail that

you're leaving behind you is not just

looks back I feel like that you're just

just talking themselves and so it's like

I feel like there's like 10 steps that

we kind of screw

glossed over hi well here we are back on

the deck you see Simon just sort of

standing on the stern kind of looking

out toward the smoke trail as it gets

farther away

he just doesn't maybe say hundred eighty

degree turn to look at the rest of the

crew and just gives you this sort of a

SAG shouldered look like he's been

abandoned old nose like a slo-mo turn

he's just like watching him gone she's

like maybe I should have just

polymorphed him into a seagull feel

special I do feel special alright palton

as you come toward the ship you can see

that it has what looked to be like a

dozen people on deck there is a sort of

a dark-skinned woman in gleaming gold

armor who's at the wheel and the crew

are all kind of dressed in black

otherwise black leathers with capes and

you can see the flag is clearly

santarém the Zaza spur city flag is also

there you note that the ship is called

the sea serpent and everybody on deck

appears to be pretty well armed but like

your ship it's not bearing any heavy

armaments like ballistas or catapults or

anything and for the most part everybody

looks kind of like warrior your Rogi but

today they do see your smoke trail

whipping through the air and I'd like

you to make a perception check to see if

you notice anything peculiar we don't

appreciate being described as Rogi well

that's a thing well everything looks

great here that's a 5 ok

yeah so your accountant crew you're

looking at anything that may be

troublesome you see that the captain has

something that looks like a snake coiled

around her wrists and she's got the

wheel

and she's not the only one there are

actually what appeared to be some flying

snakes kind of flittering around the

deck amid the crew but they're all

watching you and yeah and then that's

when crossbow bolt or sorry not crossbow

arrows come flying up in your general

direction and they have disadvantage two

arrows are launched about you all right

one of them whips past you doesn't even

come close really the other one world a

22 on the attack role that's what the

disadvantage hold on let me check yes

that hits wrong base no that's very nice

so that will be 22 points of damage as a

crossbow bolt Pierce's you and I would

like you to make a dexterity saving

through 21 all right you are not knocked

off the broom you sort of but you sort

of do a spin on the broom a a corkscrew

okay just call out and maybe just be

like well it's it's like I'm not I'm not

your enemy it's okay I came to deliver a

message

I would like to persuade them not to

shoot me out of the air all right make a

charisma persuasion truck a disadvantage

okay that's good so the first one is 25

oh no the second ones of 15 okay oh all

right you can see are you here the

captain

bark and order and the the creature that

was shooting at you lowers his bow you

guys he's got a big-ass bow and that

figure is a leather-clad half-orc who

must be at least six and a half seven

feet tall big burly grey skin tuscan

humanoid but he does lower his weapon

command okay um it's like okay I guess

I'm gonna wrong now oh here I come

that would like to very gracefully okay

since you've never done this before I

will just have you make a dexterity

check is also an option 18 okay you'll

and just leave and come back to this

ship

are you lending near the captain's wheel

on the back of the ship toward the front

or in the middle where most of the crew

are do I have an idea of where would be

the least threatening place to land

probably near the captain since it's

really just her and the half work okay

I'm gonna land in just like kind of land

like okay and you're not invisible

anymore right

no okay when you land she will say to

you and you can see that she's wearing a

turban uh-huh and about gold chain armor

over her apparel and the thing she's got

coiled around her her forearm is a

winged snake a black winged snake and a

sort of watching and hissing at you

menacingly and she says you are not what

I expected I expected the other the

witch woman yeah well you know life

happens you know you start you start

studying other than that that's a few

holds up and says my name is Katherine

taschlin ephyra what is yours boy can

they call me any like looks around it's

like 10 and she says what do you want of

us well

okay so before I actually like talk to

her what so what is it that I like know

about do I know anything about like the

flag and all that just to like I mean

you know that the centaurum is an

organization that's spread throughout

the world you've had some encounters

with them it's possible they were trying

to kill you and evil in back in Port

lions are Oh mm-hmm but otherwise of

that there they've got business

interests apart from assassinating

people mm-hmm it's like we uh we

couldn't have helped but take note that

we were on the same course indeed we

tried to keep a respectful distance that

is very respectful that's why we didn't

want to make assumptions on our way to

Waterdeep to deliver a cargo hmm well

it's not my place to ask what the cargo

is I was simply sent by my very not

threatening not a problem

not in possession of anything of any

interest whatsoever crew to just verify

that we just happen to be going to the

same place and we want no trouble of

course I wish you and your crew the

safest voyages do I trust this no okay

palms just like just like so he's like

we're gonna have some problems aren't we

she says she just nods and actually so

does the half work at the same time

before everything you know goes to a

shitstorm is there a scenario where I

get back to my ship without too much

issue

they look at each other and hey do you

need help getting back to your ship I

don't think I've ever liked to question

less I think I I could fare my own it's

less about needing the help and more of

the UH we can deliver you back to your

ship it feels like there's an asterisk

after that the the half-orc sort of

looks at the Catherine and she just she

just Pat's him on the chest and she says

it is customary for ships to respect

each other's place on the sea and I

don't mean any trouble you can leave if

you like it won't stop you

it's like the only polite thing to do

before I agree to this seeing is how I

feel like that's very much not how it

would go down our space hippos of any

interest to you she she looks at she

gives you a befuddled look I don't know

what you're asking

dude so no no no on the space okay we

don't need any space hippos ah

well me or do we that's unfortunate okay

well it's been lovely it was a pleasure

to meet you and your lovely crew I'm

going feel free to return at any time

this looks around like and be sure to

tell your friends and fellow crew that

they'll always be welcome aboard my ship

well that's very nice of you you know I

may you extend us the same courtesy if

the time comes you know what people have

their their perceptions on you but you

know what bye and I just want to try and

fly away okay

you leave in a big big cloud of smoke

that just sort of engulfs the captain

and the half work for a second and he

calls masterfully done all right and you

soar back to your friends I'll and I'll

and I'm like okay

so you know you just sort of land with

this kind of slide across the deck and

then expertly sort of pull the broom out

from between your legs as you stop I'm

gonna seize the bolt that was shot and

oh yeah there's that and the first thing

he says like oh my god what happened are

you okay say oh yeah well I we got off

on the wrong foot okay so here's the

thing I met them they were very lovely

they said we're welcome on their ship

they hope that we're welcome on theirs

and they mean us no disrespect and there

was a hell of a lot of nonverbal

communication going on I'm starting to

think that this is probably gonna be an

issue I don't know what that means no

maybe maybe they're just nice maybe

we're wrong

oh hey would you consider their posture

threatening oh my god I consider that

whole he looks like he looks at the hole

in his shoulder all right a little bit I

also like hand the broom back yeah thank

you by the way you still you've got the

bolt that was shot into your arm and

it's gotta be like this long oh well

he'll paulten also as like I'm handing

the broom back as she takes it I don't I

don't it I don't initially let go

there's like some resistance yeah I'm

sorry about your mandolin taking care of

each other and I forgive you for hurting

my feelings I'm sorry I set everything

on fire and then she takes the broom

away make sure it's still like intact

she's like scratch on it right here yes

scratch was there

those there the whole time I'll not

happen death will check with both

Warrington and the crew to see if there

is any kind of wave they can do to

disrupt their pursuers now that was like

direct engagements but I don't think

they like depth charges or anything like

that but just like something something

they can use to like kind of block their

path a little bit so they have to I

don't know Redell will tell you that or

to may knew some sly magic that often

came in handy for for ting pirates but

she is of course not present they don't

really have anything on the open water

but all they can do is essentially

continue one course and since the other

ship knows where we're going anyway it's

yeah I just wanted to buy us some time

so you don't both make a port at the

same time they will try to just get as

much out of the sails as they can if

Redell will say if any of your

spellcasters know like gusts of wind

spells or anything like that that may be

of use yes turns to Paul to miss tricks

and even guys I might be able to help

but it might be a little dangerous what

if I cast a fireball in the air behind

the sails the explosion will cause the

sails to fill up with wind from the fire

and will go faster that sounds like

science to me now straight can shape the

fire around creatures you're not so good

at shaping it around ropes and rigging

it would be pretty far away this doesn't

seem like a good idea I'm just throwing

things out there so let's talk just like

yeah definitely this ship needs more

explosions for sure I can't cast haste

on a ship can I know yeah there's really

not much the crew can do other than

maintain their course and get as much

out of the ship as they can what do we

know about poor at water deep like we've

all time they're funny you should ask

day 30

you see it the water Waterdeep sits

right on the coast its Bay is enclosed

by walls essentially there's water deep

on the shore sort of sloping down toward

the water and then there are some

islands out in the harbor that the walls

of the city extend out on to they're

built up onto these islands creating a

completely walled in Harbor except for

some gates through which ships can pass

these openings between the wall and you

know that in times of war they can bring

up giant chains out of the water to

basically block those openings off but

they are open most of the time and there

are towers regularly spaced along the

walls with like lighthouse fixtures on

some of them and so it's a highly

defensible location in times of war the

harbor itself has is divided into the

Great Harbor which makes up most of the

harbor and what's called the water deeps

naval Harbor which is a smaller portion

off section of the walled Harbor the

city itself rises up on to high ground

very quickly and you see castles towers

buildings and other things the most

striking feature of Waterdeep of course

is the mountain mount water deep rises

from the corner of the land and there is

a on one of the Spurs of the mountain a

great castle many spires many flags atop

it it's by far the easiest thing to spot

I'm curious if we know like if someone

from what Paulson told us we get the

impression that maybe they're just gonna

follow us and then once we get to water

deep there might be trouble I'm assuming

it's kind of what we're understanding so

knowing that we spent a lot of time in

water tea do we know that the the harbor

might be a safe place or are we gonna

have to like like would they stand for

that kind of shenanigan water deeps laws

are incredibly strict violence in the

open is almost sure

to get you into serious serious trouble

water deep is well defended by a city

guard it has which is the army they men

the walls as well as protect against

external threats mostly but they also

have the city watch which is a heavily

garrison police force in the city which

strictly upholds the many laws that

discourage any kinds of violence

whatsoever and on top of that Waterdeep

has the Griffin cavalry which is their

aerial attack force of Griffin riding

knights and they have the watchful order

of mages and protectors Wizards of

Waterdeep who basically swoop in and

help the army deal with any serious

threats so Waterdeep is extremely safe

only a fool would engage in an open

conflict in the city look if we can stay

safe on the open sea which it seems like

we can we just get to water deep we let

the guards know there's some real

suspicious following us and then we'll

be fine yeah I think you're right I

don't think they're foolish enough to

actually attack us never mind that then

they'll be lurking in the shadows the

entire time we're in water deep but ok I

don't know as the as your vessel glides

between the great walls into the harbor

you are struck by their immensity you're

also struck by the size of the harbor

itself you've seen it of course probably

not from this vantage point Drix is like

staring like yes there is a forest of

masts and a deluge of colored sails as

we kind of get closer detail actually it

kinda like call for Strix back Strix

come here look what and as the G like

approaches up to them Hills like look

back towards where they're going speck

look we're finally home this isn't this

isn't home what there's no this isn't

home no where I've been is home there's

only there's no there's no where I've

been that's home but the only place that

feels like home is just wherever you are

and she just like looks back at the

sails and looks out and just kind of

just shivers like a little bird the

affection kind of just takes a moment

actually don't really have like a good

response and just kind of looks back at

Waterdeep and actually like look back at

the wheel looks back at Strix back in

water deep and actually kind of like

looks down at her hand

swallows to himself and then just stays

on the ship going forward palms gonna

walk up walk up the D play hand on

shoulder be like you're doing its son

here you're gonna destroy everything if

evil had ever heard that whole

conversation I think she's just

fluttering off in the distance if the

cameras watching them behind them you

see this blurred form of evil and just

kicking in the air alright that seems

like a great place to stop so next

session will pick up in Waterdeep our

next session will not be next Tuesday

because a bunch of us are flying down to

LA to prepare for this stream of many

eyes where the ice camera action will

have not one but two game be kicking off

DC a games at the big event in LA the

first time that we will all be there

yes and you know maybe a special guest

will show up and drop in on the waffle

crew hijinks in addition I also need to

mention that after the stream of many

eyes we will be off for the the week

dead tired after the event particularly

Anna who's hosting my heart skipped a

beat when you before you said tired yeah
