hi everybody and welcome to hentai con

sorry we were just talking about

conventions so it's it's it's gonna be a

busy episode so I'm just gonna jump

right in and say hello Christina welcome

to our show thank you for joining us

it's gonna be marvelous and so as you

know and as we've talked about we

recently ran a contest with D&D beyond

to find prospects potential new members

for Strix is Chickenfoot coven so we

will be announced that we we got all the

entries in we judge them all we've got

three winners and we will announce them

at the end of this show so stay tuned

for that bit of business without further

ado previously in dice camera action the

characters encountered a harper agent

and adventurer named artist Cimber who

had in his possession or had acquired

from a three-headed frost giant a

magical ring of great power an elven

artifact called the ring of winter and

he had it in his possession because the

ring was evil and he felt he was the

only one who could really keep it out of

Evil's hands and not be consumed by it

the characters eventually parted company

with him under circumstances which I

won't belabor but were reunited when

they found him in the jungle amidst the

wreck of a crashed airship and they

fought the waffle crew and our December

artist sim bird died

I think Paul - Paul Tanish them off and

then took the ring of winter off

artist's hand and put it on and thus

began a

gradual descent into evil paulten mode

which culminated with the waffle crew

actually turning against paltin to try

to divest him of the ring the ring was

against so much as just wealthy well yes

they went to save him from the ring yeah

and managed to succeed paltin was

separated from the ring the ring

disappeared from the waffle crews

clutches taken away by an elf named

Miranda and the waffle crew returned to

their normal life as it were and carried

on their adventures with the ring of

winter and our December behind them but

before he died our December uh turd the

immortal words a Lassonde avenge me

interesting recap the waffle crew is in

water deep now they've just returned

from the santa thar's lair which they

destroyed using a vast quantity of smoke

powder they saved three barrels with the

help of their gift friend Warrington

Munt who is now made his residence

inside waffle house along with three

orphans an owl bear a puppet boy and a

albino beholder kin a grapefruit

grapefruit sized white to beholder with

four that'll stop it I socks that has

been following Strix around yes in fact

Strix you're you're in you're in the

some time is past and we can we can back

up for some stuff as well but let's

assume that you have a you have a period

of tranquility coming to you that is

owed to you at this point in time wow

that sure would be nice wouldn't it yes

I'll Coria stone marrow has been working

with the guilds to get the Waffle House

repaired to get a new cone put on the

blasted turret top of the place the

interior being refurbished floors being

replaced ceilings being replaced walls

being replaced a counter being put in

where strict spies can be laid you know

splayed out for feel like while they

were fixing the turret strikes light

just openly said like yeah so I'm in

Captain kit and that kid in there yes

and while this is going on Strix you're

probably like baking pie so that you

have something to display eventually

when you open up your bakery so you're

working feverishly in the kitchen you're

getting ingredients from different

guilds coming in to you and all coria's

making sure that's all paid for she's

basically like managing your finances at

this point and keeping everything in a

ledger that she carries around with her

and while this is going on you're you're

like breaking eggs and stirring them up

in a pot and then making pies out of

ingredients flour chickens yes you got

flour all over you you're just white

with flour occasionally I'll be the

little beholder we'll look at what

you're cooking and just sort of drool

into it and you'll be good so while the

waffle house is being rebuilt and things

are normal in so far as you know you

have an al bear running around kids

running around and all that other

business going on what else is happening

to you guys deaath acquired Gnarls book

yes does anyone in the party speak

elvish I do oh you do yeah cool yeah

yeah oh I do too except not not

happening today on my end so go for it

yeah I guess like you know I had to take

a second language in paladin school

along the celestial alright well great

so during these times off death will

work with evylyn to try to translate

that book

and learn as much as you could about the

previous is anitha's dealings okay I

love books what you're able to discern

right away is that NarL was probably

with this Anitha for about a year and

kept detailed notes various individuals

that thes Anitha would meet there's also

a description of an altercation between

Zanna thar and lady Lera

silver hand which you found particularly

intriguing that being that at some point

the Zanna thar did something you're not

exactly sure what and lady lair all

silver hands single-handedly fought her

way into the lair cornered this Anitha

told him off causing this Anitha to hide

from her so as he would not actually

face her

he was basically talking to her through

a wall and then she went off and the

zennith are sort of got kind of several

of the things he was pursuing in the

city kind of went away after that he's

been he's tried to keep a low profile

thereafter you're also able to get out

of the book that there's many dealings

chronicled between this Anitha and the

centaurum so many in fact that is going

to take you a few days to digest it all

but suffice to say it is a complete

chronicle of the negotiations by thes

Anitha and the Santarem to merge their

two organizations together into one big

sort of shadow Empire and then the

subsequent falling a part of those

negotiations when the zennith are

accused the santarem of stealing the

stone of goal or a powerful item from

his lair something that thes ents

feverishly furbish they denied right and

then there were half-hearted attempts to

basically take out zennith our agents in

the city thereafter so while that's

going on so how long has it been since

basically in the last session like a

couple days yeah yeah okay

so pretty much in this time like Alton's

just been locked away in his room just

like only sneaking out to like find well

we are we totally out of wine stellar

did we restock at some point so it's the

wine is starting to show up the vendor

the Brewers vintners distillers guild

has been delivering crates of wine to

you and I'll Coria just like she's doing

with all the other things is basically

tracking the expenses and covering the

costs today so basically every few hours

he'll just like kind of yeah make his

way down grab more and then just walk

back up yes and just this in a side DF

remember you've got a whole bunch of

money out of the zenith arse layer yep

that you've got packed away yeah okay

but anyway Paul yes yeah pretty much

nothing not saying anything just like

just like yeah not not doing great I

think even keeps trying to like check on

him and and she's starting to get

worried because usually he snaps out of

a mood sooner than this especially if he

gets wine but she's noticing that he's

not yeah so at some point I think she

takes him aside or like meets him at the

bar and it's like maybe maybe maybe you

don't need more wine maybe you're fine

just dead-eyed and then just still goes

to his room she's like why are you so

upset still what's bothering you

so his mumblings are still pretty much

kind of uh on par with how they have

been ever since statue evil and just

shattered he's just like lunatic talking

to himself he's just like yeah I'll just

die he'll die she's like look at me I'm

alive I'm fine nothing happened to me

why are you still so upset I'm not dead

she's dead she's dead cuz of me

whoo well yeah she like very sombrely

just looks up he says not you well see

ya I'm not good see we're making

progress this is good don't you feel

better now

she still is who tricks is fine

yes look it's real sweet that you care

that much about us as friends but we're

fine and I don't know what you're still

holding on to but believe look see we're

fine

it's Sandra I don't who she feels his

head are you I don't really I don't

think we know is Sandra you didn't she

kind of like leans back and she's like

oh you do you want to talk about it

he takes a bailed she was my wife

and like everyone else she's dead

because of me I'm sure that I'm sure

that can't be true you were married

was yeah it's a little long time ago way

before I met any of you what happened

well we had been married for I give us

two years I don't know that that whole

times a big blur and I was I was doing

what I did I was out playing a play

another gig I was called to I shouldn't

have we didn't need the money we were

doing okay you're doing fun but I still

went for it say why would I say no to

say no to some extra cash right who

wouldn't and I don't know who I pissed

off but apparently was the wrong guy

we're girl I don't assume came back

guard was there people were huddled

around my house and there's there's

so much blood and I should have

been there but I wasn't as always evylyn

just reaches out to like touch his arm

[Music]

but then kind of takes her hand back and

she's like I know it wasn't your fault

so it's my fault every time I could do

something but no I don't what do you

mean you pissed off somebody that that

doesn't sound logical I don't know man

you're mean you play the shady places I

did you you make some enemies but they

it's weird they'd they couldn't they

couldn't figure out what happened they

just found her they don't know who did

it and I couldn't do anything about it

just it wouldn't tell me anything

oh sorry I must be excruciating to see

death again after something like that

and you must never want to love again

it's not a matter of want any time I try

to gone it's all gone so I figure the

best thing I can do about anything I

care about is keep it at arm's length

well I guess we're here at the end of

the arm whenever you're ready

he just kind of drops his head just

sitting there sulking he tries to give

him a hug like timidly thank you

well that's going on you can hear a

couple of rooms over just the kids

stomping around bouncing around yelling

screaming completely oblivious to you

know adult issues does he accept the

hugs he doesn't deny it he just kind of

sits there in a ball just huddled up on

the ground palms just kind of yeah

that definitely I feels that feels a

little better I think thank you that I I

guess I just needed to skip that out

there and uh I just thought maybe it

would explain some things yeah better

talk about anything I'm here I like to

listen I'm just not one to like pry you

know

oh no of Cour of course yeah yeah um so

good talk

as usual yeah I left something on the by

me washed out of the room just like head

down embarrassed okay yeah you walk you

walk out of the room

I assume evil and you follow uh I think

she lets him go yeah if he's like

obviously trying to disengage she's like

oh yeah yeah you hear that you hear

familiar what's become a familiar sound

which is Warrington months slamming his

head into a rafter letting out a small

expletive as he tries to accommodate

himself in this building that's really

not built for a person of his size

anyway as you make your way carry on as

it were evil and you're downstairs you

see the kids have have sort of migrated

down there and at a table you can see

the young boy martim Trek is there and

he's got like a top hat and he's trying

to do a magic trick to amuse the other

kids actually he's using he's using

Simon's hat is Jingle Bell hat he's

trying to perform a trick with a magic

wand but every time before he can get

the incantation out Juniper keeps

wanting to pop out of the Hat and sort

of scamper off and so they he keeps no

no tuna

at the end get back in the Hat but it

strikes you as interesting because Simon

and Martin seem to be associating with

each other and the way that kids do and

not in really this is the first time

you've seen them together since their

traumatic ordeal even sees this and like

she's walking and you would normally

expect her to be like Oh children

pleasant engage and she like Pat's them

both rigidly on the head she's like melt

on children and she's just like on a

beeline she's looking for deer okay what

you find you find him at some point she

pulls him aside and she's like yeah what

do you have a second that I could talk

to you for a second what were they

currently doing do I have a second

whatever you want to be doing it's

probably something super important

required a lot of thought and planning

and processing and spread oak Oriole

quarry I told you how you might be able

to invest some money maybe and you're

like looking at papers yeah and he puts

all these papers and pens down and just

goes yeah you bought of course anything

you need it's no big deal or anything

just kind of you know like thinking

about Paulson was married I'm sorry yeah

he was married before talking laundry

and she died what he was married

although I was married he was married I

never knew that

[Laughter]

of course it's fine it means not like I

have any personal reaction other than

just concern for our friends but I just

knew that I know that information now

and I thought maybe you would also like

to know that information I guess I mean

it does explain some things and maybe

it'll should I like should I do anything

different

have I been like I died in front of him

all the time oh that's not your fault

maybe it's hurting him like how dare you

[Laughter]

like everytime that's something that

happens he gets like this and we know

that it's not like yeah of course I'm

not nothing similar to wise level or

anything but it seems like upsetting him

you know one none of us ever wants to

die it's not something we plan yeah

that's not something you can blame

yourself for and of course it's going to

hurt it's going to hurt all of us no one

wants to see that I wrote all of you all

the time huh no not no sorry it's not

like that I didn't mean it like that

you're you're a constant sunshine in

their life and I think he needs that

more than anything and if he was married

before I mean all right whatever

yes uh sunshine totally that's yes it's

all fine it's all fine it starts to rain

outside

like really really heavy heavy heavy

spring rain just downpour all of a

sudden make sure she's fine

thanks yeah sure no problem

she goes the keepers okay as she leaves

yes it kind of looks damn themself and

just like I blew that one it also cursed

you that the name Sondra sounds vaguely

familiar to me no no she's just like hey

how are you feeling facedown her pie has

collapsed yeah yes just like she's just

depressed it should because she's gotten

all these nice things it's like

everything's been fixed the place is all

wonderful and clean and and you know

every there's all these like these

hopeful things happening she's just

having like a crisis that she could

never have her own happiness and she

could never have her own kitchen and she

could never have her friends around her

so she's just crying eventually wouldn't

even like it keeps trying to be like

everything's fine isn't it great you see

that it's like the laughs that turns

into a cry where she's like she just

lays down next to strikes face down and

they're both just laying face down in

this pile of clothes together

no no strict strict will hug her sticks

isn't gonna leave her crying a lot

one of the unseen servants right one of

the unseen servants also just sort of

floats over a hankie gonna like I can

Nestle her into her robes like a mother

hen

just like the robes are the wings and

she'll just cry into her like golden

curly hair just like in the corner and

she's just like I

you hear boom boom it sounds like the

heaviest knock on the front door you've

ever heard what come in Warrington

echoes throughout the entire house

strike so misty step to the front door

okay you're at the front door it's

closed and it's raining you can hear the

rain on the other side of the door

outside and by now evening has fallen

The Sun has set and it's still pouring

rain Venus strikes is like since this is

her now she thinks it's her pie shop

she's just like I know it's raining

we've got warm pies and it's gonna be a

great place for you to sit in between to

open the door wendy is approaching the

door at the same time with when you

throw open the door and you look out you

can see the coming night outside the the

hard rain pouring down and pitter an off

the cobblestones and you strict you look

out and you don't see anybody there's

nobody at the door but then you both see

some movement down on the floor in the

doorway and you see a severed hand all

sort of black and desiccated you've seen

this hand before this is handy why and

you can see this nasty desiccated hand

just like thing from the Addams Family

sort of scuttles in and doesn't look

around but you get the sense that it is

kind of getting its bearings and it just

sort of goes underneath your robe Strix

over toward UDA that just tries to

scuttle around you like it's looking for

someone how did you find us how do you

hit the door so hard yeah that doesn't

you don't know how that tiny hand which

is just like an old

in hand ya could have made such a

thunderous boom that sounds like magic

do I need our Canon check to see if

that's magic go ahead okay that seems

like it might be magic that's an 11 yeah

okay someone's got magic outside and so

I'm gonna go look yeah all right I'll

let Alton notes it's for him if I die

don't come get me

still walk outside okay so Strix is

standing out in the night rain looking

around for any sign of who or what may

have made this thunderous boom at the

door if not the hand you look out Strix

and as the water is pouring off the brim

of your hat you're kind of looking at

the house and it does look much nicer

now that it's the windows have been put

back in and there's you know a little

almost like dog house shed for Lance

your mule alright and the towers not

letting all the rains seep into your

house which is good but as you look

around because of all the rain there's

not much activity here on troll skull

alley it's all pretty quiet except for

what sounds like thunder coming in off

the coast and you can see the there are

lamp lights on your neighbors buildings

your lamps outside have not been lit so

your place looks except for the light

coming from the inside rather dark and

foreboding

can i fire both the lamps to turn them

on that would probably just break the

glass and probably damage the lamps more

than just like everything I touch breaks

yeah alright is there any can I like

look around there's any rain aim like

falling off in a weird pattern maybe

someone's invisible in the rain you

don't see anything like that okay mom I

just yell up

if there's anyone out here being spoke

be please just tell us now because

really it's just easier if you just kill

us at this point because we're just so

tired you hear what are your neighbors

say every night

really

[Laughter]

which alright paltin you are reunited

with hand room when he scampers over to

you crawling across the floor on his

fingertips you see that he is slightly

different from when we last saw him

other than the fact he was still a dead

old hand but there are bumps on his hand

that suggests old scars that weren't

there before and they have almost glyph

like or sigil like patterns to the

scarring I'm just like buddy what I like

I like hold up a fist to see if this

bumps nice bumps you boom oh my god what

happened like what what wait what

happened what do you do you can't talk

you cannot um okay I I don't recognize

the the markings do I you can make an

Arcana check okay that's really not good

yep oh but 22 that's really good so you

think that somebody has probably not him

andrew itself but somebody has

ensorcelled Oren spelled Han drew with

protective abjuration magic like he's

been he's been magic DUP basically I'm

just like holding him like do you have

new tricks the other thing that your

Arcana check is able to do is you think

that you've seen markings like this

before in the Raven Queen's palace I

remember that and just like immediately

drop them I'm like oh right that's right

oh oh he tries to just sort of crawl

back up next to you okay

Oh Oh

[Laughter]

can he write probably can I try

yeah you can sort of try to hand him a

pen and he can try to write it's like

yeah it'll sort of scratch out on I

don't know what you're just a piece of

paper I guess you're having them right

yeah sure he just writes out hi okay um

probably on the back of a very important

piece of paper from Diaz oh yeah

probably just one a just like this

doesn't look impaired his bedroom who do

you think's been managing everything

like a corner of his bedroom

it's like waffle crew income tax that's

not important write it on this I'm just

like um what are you why are you here it

writes hi yeah basically don't know good

okay

did did you go back to the Raven Queen

yes question mark did she send you to

kill me no question mark so many sort of

scratches earth question mark complicit

exhalation point like so are we cool yes

all right this is an ominous at all

sweet

welcome back bud gives you a thumbs up

and the night passes into the wee hours

of the morning the rain continues then

by early morning after a fierce

thunderstorm I go out there and make

sure the chickens stay dry oh yeah that

too you can bring them into the kitchen

actually in the rain yes when you're out

there and you're moving crates of

chickens back in to the kitchen there is

there is a fierce bolt of lightning that

sort of strikes one of the sort of the

iron spires on a nearby building kind of

lights up a you know one Street over and

there's a sense Strix that this storm

it's it's kind of ferocity and it the

way it sort of bears down on you there's

a hint of the unnatural to it like

almost like you sense it's a harbinger

okay so I like it like seven chickens Oh

master I hold them all like this like

come on guys and there's like they're

all under my arms and I'm just like the

storms back

magic please close the doors yep and

that the kids asked you if it would be

okay if they slept over at Martins house

tonight Martin's parents been no okay

they'll they'll sleep here then and

they'll mark Martin they'll let Martin

go before the it gets yeah they don't

want they don't want to go back there

they may they make them work what I'm

sleeping Martin's house it's fine

where's Martin who are these kids we'll

invite Martin's parents over for dinner

and oh my god a nice talk and then if

things go well and they're responsible

people then you can go spend the night

there

okay or excited I mean if you guys think

that Simon can babysit then they can go

yes Simon can maybe say he literally

like stuns people Simon do you want

Kelly responsible for all the other

children who not see you soon

he loved Simon don't you like having a

cool job see letting go

Paulson there you can orcas magic bad

things are going to happen it's called

it Obon that happens all the time

omen omen did you write a letter when he

even last palton he's just like Andrews

back

ominous storm kids want to go yeah I

feel like the kids probably shouldn't be

here right now don't know why all right

well maybe take waffles as well we well

I mean the waffles can hit hard and that

looks at evylyn and she basically signs

like we're grown-up enough to take care

of ourselves like very like yeah sassy

marching Martin will also say that he

doubts his parents will let him bring

the albear into the house squigglies

just like I'll stay if there's a fight

I'm ready

he's like Amy's arrow at like everything

not yet I think Jenks is just too ready

to like busy like hiding the pies stop

stop when that SAS is evil and she looks

at the earth like oh I'm not unknown

stairs here fine have fun at Martin's

Quigley's like oh alright so the kids

disappear from the scene and you don't

see them

ever again no I'm just a guy so when the

morning comes you are all awakened by

the sounds of distant horns and you've

heard you've probably heard the horns

like these a few times since you've been

in the city there used to sort of

marshal city guards oh but you were you

sort of heard one and then another one

and then another one other one other one

and the sheer number of horns has you

concerned these are not these are not

close either there there's some distance

off maybe that has nothing to do with us

and someone else will take care of it

maybe it's fine and these homes are like

completely separate than ones that like

all the Gripen cavalry or anything yes I

was gonna make everyone breakfast but

now there's a crisis so I guess I'll

just go take care of that if anyone else

would like to make breakfast though just

don't don't bother all a quick guy I'm

sure you'd be great at making breakfast

yet she's just like jumps out the window

on her way home all right

when you go out the window your broom

backfires and leaves a big cloud of

smoke hanging I think it's the neighbor

who yelled at me you soar up into the

morning sky and everything is wet and

there are puddles of water everywhere in

the city that you can see but what

strikes you right away is that there is

a huge force of city guards threading

through the city toward the eastern

walls and when you get high above the

city and look out in that direction now

- east of Waterdeep is not so the sea is

to the west to the east is basically

rolling farmland and there's actually a

small village outside of Waterdeep to

the east surrounded by farmland it's

called under cliff

the village wonder cliff and so lots of

farms and dotted woods as far as you can

see well there's something going on out

near the village of under cliff because

there are some odd fires and smoke and

what looks like an army an army yes do I

recognize the colors from any sort of

part of the sort of coast you'd have to

get much closer I don't want to get

closer to an army ok I will just go

ahead and zoom back to the house and

sort of just like as you as you wheel

around back to the house you can see

that the cities Griffin cavalry is

currently marshalling and flying in wing

formations out toward a village of under

cliff are they close enough to where I

can zoom up to one you'd have to get

you'd have to go across about half the

city to get to them but you could

intercept them on their way heading

eastward alright and there's there's

about there's about 50 of them ok I'm

gonna do that I'm gonna zoom up to them

and I feel like one of the one of the

helmed Knights it's hard to tell just

looking at them at a glance because they

got big lances and they've got sort of

gold and white gleaming armor one of

them stares back at you through the

slits in his or her helm and says clear

off inquiring minds want to know

there is the night will tell you there

is a large army of elves what appeared

to be wild elves and they have brought a

forest with them aha the forest is

attacking the village is there anyone in

charge or anyone that looks like a

general or something that probably

someone

my group of friends have pissed off all

you can see that one of the gryphon

riding Knights has a sort of a billowing

red cape that might suggest someone of a

higher station maybe a captain or a

colonel but there are sort of at the

lead of this Vanguard yeah so I'm like

hi I'm Strix I've made a lot of mistakes

with my friend and can you tell me if if

there's like who these these dolls are

this woman just sort of shakes her head

and says are you with the watchful order

I sure AM all we know is that elves are

attacking the village in force with the

aid of creatures called trance as well

as other woodland creatures we don't

know why and we have no other

information all right Thank You captain

and she like salutes like totally wrong

she's just like all right while Strix is

gone what are the rest of you doing

I guess attempting to make breakfast

okay there are these there are these

chickens around yeah I'm sure I pick up

on a few things around being around

Strix enough that's good as you're

working the unseen servants are helping

you out by basically bringing things to

you in the order in which you would need

them oh good

death alone in the kitchen to the unseen

servant says Fiona asks I did this

figured it out on my own even comes and

sits with him while he makes it and just

kind of watches sitting up the little

table in the corner yeah okay waffles

will probably be on hand too as is

customary to see what falls on the floor

and all that yeah

Oh your honor your Article II D Ethel

turn to evil inch like this look done to

you even knows nothing and so she's like

yeah great for this I feel like you

should roll for this

oh yeah and paltin what do you have two

palms been in his room trying to like I

guess figure out what's different about

the hand at this point yeah so yeah

definitely looks like it has been an

assault or so insource old and but other

than that it's behaving just like it was

behaving one last you had it okay

oh god on the way back I Rick's is

flying her broom and she's like that's

really weird and she like you see this

flashback of the hand and this flashback

of Miranda saying my people made this

the flashback to the elves and she's

like alright a Lassonde how would you

how do you envision your entrance I

entered around a Tyrannosaurus Rex is

back excellent oh alright okay okay

though after so most of you are still in

the Waffle House Strix make a perception

check okay what you don't what what you

don't see is a small cadre of robed

individuals seamlessly waking there

making their way through the quiet water

deep streets as the guards have all sort

of rushed off to the east you don't see

them throw off their cover revealing

their armor and whatnot you don't see

them summon their dinosaur mounts and

you don't see them Stampede toward the

Waffle House what am i I'm just like

looking at it like a pie shop like four

streets over going is that a car yeah I

mean you're you're obviously distracted

by the the waves of guards going

basically being called to duty to the

eastern wall you're obviously you're

also probably seeing what look like

wizards taking to the air with flying

spells yeah there's there's lots going

on to distract you look at their outfits

and I'm like

somehow somehow you do not see the

Tyrannosaurus and those of you in the

kitchen here and you see the drink in

front of you evil in Jurassic Park style

just sort of make ripples the chickens

run before everyone else notices yeah

yeah alright Strix roll initiative

[Laughter]

alright you get ambushed in the air you

don't know they they're moving so fast

and just like bolts fired from crossbows

they come at you you see two armored

figures on pterodactyls they're

pterodactyls have sort of armor razor

like beaks cool and they have rainbow

feathers right and they the riders hurl

gleaming gold javelins at you one of

them rolls a 17 one of the rolls a 22

what's the range of your hellish rebuke

because they aren't I'm trying to do it

right they're attacking me yeah it's

very it's very very rude when I'm

checking

[Music]

that had done but 16 so yes yes and they

have 16 so the one that you target

succeeds so it will take half damage

from your hella tribute you by the way

took a total of 20 points of damage from

the two javelins okay okay all right

[Music]

I will tell us forget the appropriate

time Roya damage and all a Sunday your

Tyrannosaurus Rex is standing outside of

the Waffle House oh oh good got it from

the top your stretch stream again well

no but nobody would because there's too

much horn activity going on doing it

okay a Lassonde yes you seem to have

caught them by surprise Wow no one's

surprised about that

well it does take some preparation to

plan the proper vengeance so so I am

going to scream out from the top of my

Tyrannosaurus send me the one

responsible for the death of our

December this voice echoes through troll

skull alley

so I hear it you do there's an

unfamiliar voice Paul I'm just kind of

looks up because ku1 here's out

yeah deaath allah immediately puts down

all his cooking things carefully turned

off the stove first and then he's

probably wearing Strix is apron in like

oh my god and then goes for his uh

equipment very quickly okay but

breakfast is gonna get cold so we'll do

our bodies and listen to handle this oh

ho good line

alright so two figures March out of this

old gothic mance one of them is a human

in an apron youngish fella and the other

is are you in your armor evylyn yeah

one is in her gleaming gold armor her

curly locks catching the morning light

you don't just see what appears to be a

regal woman astride a Tyrannosaurus Rex

you see a second woman a little ways

past her in a dusky robe her face hidden

in shadow on the back of a triceratops

hello welcome to caroico alley in the

Waffle House I'm evil and more thing and

this is did woodrow at your service

do I look like I'm here for pleasantries

I repeat do I look like I am here for

pleasantries asked a question and it has

a very simple answer no you're not here

for pleasantries who is responsible for

the death of our artists Simba

and I want you to know that when I asked

this question I know the answer so be

very direct and very very concise paltin

walks out this point goes okay now

listen let's say let's let this this

helicopter pass really quick now let's

say someone here was who are we speaking

to my name is Alice Santa our December

was my husband

and someone took him away from me and an

immortal life has a long time to spend

alone is a long time bandar-e it kind of

puts his hand up at Paulding almost a

kind of signal like don't talk for just

a moment I'm gonna try something India

at Alice and I would say no one man or

person otherwise was that fault the for

the death of our December well anything

that claimed his life was that of the

ring of winter to which he van Leeuw

attempted to keep under control but

eventually claimed him as well

it could be argued see it doesn't feel

great so you're looking for the one took

his life am i correct correct yes okay

considering that's exactly what I just

said right I know I'm definitely not

stalling I hear more warhorns off toward

the east constricts try to get back with

javelins and her at this point yeah so

the gentleman sort of fall out of you

after after piercing your flesh you you

propel yourself toward troll skull alley

realizing that your broom matches the

speed of their mounts so you can kind of

try to keep ahead of them if all you do

is move okay I move all right so leave a

big smoke trail behind you as you race

back and you can see now a Tyrannosaurus

Rex with a rider a triceratops with a

rider outside of the waffle house and

not a not a garden sight humble down in

front of everyone like they're trying to

kill us that lady looks mean

yeah you made it cool so Paulding

carries on he kind of like looks off to

the side he goes holy 25 charisma

okay here's I can I can I can see that

congratulations um okay so I know the

answer so that was me

what do I have my assumptions sure but

I'll give the benefit of a doubt what is

it you seek by being here grovel grovel

you're gonna need to succeed on a wisdom

saving throw or the ground there we go

14 that is not cool beat the save DC but

did you count the erroneous for evil and

being present Oh No yeah plus five

yeah so that would be when I say 1444 90

good so 19 I like to headcanon that that

that looks like palton starting to like

almost kneel on the ground and even was

like no she smacks him yeah he's like oh

yeah I know I don't know hot what is the

DC Kristina for Alice ondas what's her

spell DC hold on one second

okay she's got a pretty much DC so LTC

21 there we go she's so you feel a

compulsion to grovel before her tones

like okay okay okay and how does he

grovel yeah palms like setting aside a

he's like you know I feel like with with

that DC this was kind of setup this is

rigged but you know what it's fine could

I tell that she was casting that it

seemed to just be a word coming out of

her mouth but given the reaction you're

almost certain that they're the spell

did transpire and is now over I didn't

have time to come first olive Lin also

has commands so she probably recognized

that too right it's just a it literally

just triggers off on verbal so by the

time you by the time it's happened it's

happened it's there's no you know

there's no gestures but yes you like

decided to grovel yeah this this this

seems like something that evil and has

the ability to do as well she glares

she's like you know it doesn't mean

anything if you tell them to do it

flee to me yeah oh no I don't succeed

against the 21 that a fear that sucks

and you see evens face just get confused

as she kind of like rises into the air

and just leaves okay I don't like this

I'm gonna bat hell polymorph or stupid

dinosaur

all right let's wait here group Alton's

grubbles pongos i I'm sorry

and I assume you've come for justice and

I assume that's my life he'll one for

his correct yes

yes so so I kill your husband you kill

me and that's what justice balance

what's coming to me I want the ring back

I don't have that where is it I don't

know that I want that ring and I want

your life that zoom:1 can't happen we

out the other as well so find a remedy

to this look I don't know where the ring

is

I don't know who took it I'd like to

cast on a truth okay let's uh since

you're casting a spell and it has

components to it let's roll initiative

just so we know the order of operations

for everyone

how big

truth and how close is do so I believe

I'll double check this on the truth is

pretty squirrelly about that zona Trixie

feet okay yeah so it's a so it's sixty

feet out but it's a 15 foot radius

sphere so if it's basically centered on

paltin it'll get all of you except

evylyn okay so Holly what was your role

nineteen okay

nineteen evylyn evylyn eighteen thank

you

Halton twenty look at all these great

roles all signed up fifteen all right

and role for a few other folks here the

the to pterodactyl riders are sort of

circling over your neighborhood

observing what's happening but they

don't lend a Lassonde casts zone of

truth is anybody trying to counter spell

or do anything I only counter spell when

it hurts okay

zone of truth effect ground zero on

palton goes off all the Sun did you want

to do anything outside of your attack

action are you just gonna wait at this

point I'm just gonna wait it out okay

then that goes off in kind of the

surprise round so now at the top of the

initiative order it is Paul tans turn so

I like recognize dona truth from it

being cast on me a couple times right

yeah this has got a slightly different

flavor because it was sort of learned in

a different way in a different place but

yeah you recognize it

okay say I tell her like you can think

I'm lying but I don't know where it is

paulten goes wait right Chris I never I

didn't realize where it is true yes you

did not you did not learn what else it

was taken off you while you were

basically in suspended time enemy

so you could not even perceive who took

it hmm so uh he he says to her yes you

know I'm a lot like you counsel hmm all

this justice Sendas and this vengeance

it's fun I've I've lost a lot of people

I've loved and like you I did everything

I could to go after them make sure they

were held responsible one of them I

didn't get to actually see fall two of

them got away but the rest got I damn

sure took action like you did to make

sure that they suffered and they were

held accountable you want to know what I

can tell you from that you're gonna tell

me obviously I am very perceptive it

doesn't do anything the pain of the loss

the morning it doesn't it doesn't go

away but what does grow stronger anger

so that hatred it just stays

with you ma'am he just like like puts

this little bug way he's like I have I

have this thing just let me go through

it uh-huh yes people who killed my my

son they're gone is he even still like

in range at least visible she's probably

visible yeah

my points they're the ones who've killed

her over and over and over again gone

and I let one get away and you know what

I don't know if that was the right call

but yeah I know

I have regret if I saw him I would I'd

put him out of his misery same with

seeing what the ones who killed my wife

but I can tell you that this is the kind

of path you want to go down you're gonna

turn into something nasty something

heinous and you'll get to a point where

you look in the mirror and you're just

like I don't even know who the that

is so it's that really that really the

kind of person you are do you think I

amassed an army of over 5,000 to be

stopped by a speech and some victim

noises yes seriously okay all right fine

so be it

and he he just kind of puts his head

down he goes make it quick all right

it is now Diaz turn how's that Sona

truth working for your body hate it

that's the truth uh after like palton

base of the egg puts his head down yeah

also kind of steps forward and just says

look you clearly want to wring more than

anything else we're telling you we don't

know

where it is it was taken from us that

thing is evil

it ruins people it almost ruined paltin

is what took the life of artists we're

trying to we did everything we could to

help to get it out of here that's and

we're telling you like we don't know

where it is and killing paltin will just

make it that much harder for you to even

find it it's not even in this same plane

of existence what's shadow bout

thank you Strix the robed woman on the

triceratops says that one's mine

for aha don't do anything else the

eighth on your turn I would say probably

not I don't want to make any kind of

aggressive move here because this

doesn't look like a battle we could win

on account of their dinosaurs so I guess

it's just more yeah I guess it'll be

like more ready in action he'll like

step in and defend should one of them

attack first he's not going to go after

anyone right now okay Strix I don't like

that me and lady but she's just gonna

like

she's going let's go look it at Paulson

and say yes oh woe is being a P Shall

Perish and then she just like feels like

this never ever bring the dead back to

life paltin picks up on the Sark house

just like Jesus I'm offering up my

 life here have some respects

tricks for you and then you should leave

as it happens know very well there let's

make it quick and new talking and I'll

kill you all

why do you so mean

years of practice what made you mean why

do you mean do you want to pie why don't

you come in for a pie you don't need to

do this I'm so tired

does all this make you whatever body one

are you dating take a knee

sherry I'm serious I just you look like

a candy blood you put all over the place

or something like there's a nun Janelle

be like why are we doing this like we

can get the ring back we know who has

these weirdos it's still faces I'm sorry

I'm sorry what was that

so you just said you'd know who they

were you know who the people that took

the ring is said that he did not know I

like who

he probably doesn't remember her name

just give him a break he drinks like all

day Paul is just like what the hell are

you talking about he's in the zone of

truth he can't lie I just say it so I

just don't attack us we found our house

blown up 75 I really just want you to go

away I'm trying to make a place where I

make these pies and make everyone happy

and I feel like everyone hates me

and I having such a bad time and I just

want to have a nice time and I know

magic and you know I doesn't even matter

you certainly don't know where it is we

have an idea who possibly could have it

but there's no real good way to get over

there and for the record she makes an

incredible pie thank you at least

someone cares are you gonna go make me a

pie are you gonna stand here and keep

saying things I don't care to hear I

will make you a pie you just say please

because it's rude to just ask for things

yes yep all right well no we're

boundaries this what just plate at that

point I throw a javelin in her general

direction I just wanted to be quiet so a

dagger sticks in between the

cobblestones next well you know what you

know what now you're now you're getting

boysenberry and then she runs inside

pawns like we actually agree on

something boysenberry is just terrible

that's true it's overrated I don't

understand it I mean of all berries

boysenberries is one of the weakest

[Music]

poison please you don't talking about

you you probably don't just have any

lying on because I took some from that

mushroom place well then that you have

yep

okay so you said you pull that off the

shelf and unplug it and Oh

yeah that's good meanwhile nyle Endre on

her triceratops turns to you Alessandra

and says L rain is not going to be happy

about this news about the ring I

understand that we have an agreement and

I am going to uphold my end but you know

the reason I'm here I would not have

risked everything to come here I'm with

you to the end it made it be sooner than

we think I'm ready it is your turn I'm

sorry no evilman's turn my mistake

evylyn you out of 18 so you had fled

yeah that I believe that effect ends

yeah like she went out she was just

trying to grapple a Lassonde and take

her like take her with like here's also

I was sitting on the t-rex it just

stopped since you since you pretty much

used all your movement last round to get

away it'll take all your movement to get

back so yeah you can attempt to grapple

her if you want I just want to grab her

off the t-rex okay all a Sunday you see

that sure her coming for you

specifically off it here you just wants

to yeah okay go ahead and now this is

since your grappling rather than

attacking this is treated using the

grappling rules which for you I believe

is going to be a strength check let me

just make sure down easy

okay so you can grapple so make a

strength athletics check contested by

all the Sun does strength athletics

check or a dexterity acrobatics check

but I think Allison is probably gonna be

long ago strength

Oh asunder what's your strength

athletics check let's see 32 okay so you

attempt to grapple her and then you just

sort of feel this supernatural thrust

and like a feather you are just pushed

away like it's you almost felt like you

are grappling something impossibly

strong I'm just sorry that we killed

them we didn't mean to we tried to stop

the ring and we couldn't and I'm sorry

that your husband did okay what am I

going to do it you're sorry sorry I

shouldn't be laughing this is the sad

this group of adventurers she's yeah

despite my laughter the I'm sure

Evelyn's tears are absolutely 100%

sincere okay right yeah now it is a

Lassonde and company alisande your

retinue will only act after you do so

what would you like to do Strix has gone

back into their house to make some sort

of pie that could take an hour tie them

up

all right the Nylund ray command my my

Landry will snap her fingers and

immediately vines burst up between the

cobblestones and try to wrap around DF

and paltin mmm so I need dexterity

saving throws from you two gentlemen as

all right after she says tie them up

he's just like yeah it was probably a

better choice 18:19 okay

as these grasping vines try to entwine

around the both of you you slip you both

slip out of them dodge away hop away hop

to the side all that it takes and

different ones try to grab you from

different directions and try to snag

your arms your legs your feet your

ankles your neck but every one of those

that tries to latch onto you you finagle

your way out of and neither of you are

and wrapped by it the two on the or one

of the ones on the back of the

pterodactyl pulls out a whip and tries

to flash it around

evylyn so evil in he's got to make a

grapple with the whip you can make your

strength athletics check - or dexterity

acrobatics to avoid being grabbed okay

so without even looking this blip comes

right around your neck and you're just

wasted backwards toward him and then his

buddy

pulls out his whip and also while you're

held there it sort of lashes it around

your waist so they're both holding you

with their whips and you're just did the

air with these two whips coiled around

the top they turn to you

everything hurts what you feel right now

is hella everything inside me feels with

him god I loved him help me find the

ring and I will let you live do you want

a hug you've got this we're not there

yet

Alton's gonna turn to her say I get lost

I told you I get it so and then he kind

of he kind of like goes blank for a

minute and then Strix is still in the

kitchen right yes okay straik see here

Paulding he's just like are you sure you

know where the ring is

I'm just Hyrum you don't see him I don't

remember anything that's why I said that

it wasn't like no it's fine

name just all them back out there goes

we'll do everything we can to find it if

that's what will make it right also

sorry in advance and they just like

disappears and they just kind of watched

out the front door he's like that's a

safety precaution but we'll still help

find the ring so what the rest of you

see is palton just sort of

banished and then paltin comes out of

the house like you've seen the mists

you've seen the mislead spell be used

before but this is the first time it's

really sort of it's like she's watching

Game of Thrones and there was just like

a even if it's like super taken aback by

this it's like death will still address

Olly Sandow though and says we agree

with you that the ring should be found

it's not something that should just be

let loose out without out there in the

world or whatever but if you don't mind

me asking what is it that you want it

for more than just a keepsake door it's

not exactly easy to gather five thousand

wild elves and an army I've made a deal

and I've offered the ring to someone in

return for helping me with my vengeance

which I'm sorry you guys are just too

pathetic to kill the woman the woman on

the Triceratops is says they are they

really really are

Wow glad you guys can please understand

that we're nothing I do I really do that

was never our intent to lose the ring in

the first place we understand its power

we understand its corruption and we want

nothing more from than that ring to be

safely locked away or destroyed the ring

is an elven artifact they want it

returned to them that's where it should

be

right it's already cost too much

how long is this pie gonna take I'd say

like 30 minutes pass if you guys just

standing there awkwardly yeah when

you're in there so you all hear a door

on the balcony this would be the second

floor front-facing balcony off of

waffles den basically get thrown open

and a Lassonde you see this big hippo

man with a keg over his head I don't

know and he says be gone this is my

house and I won't let you destroy it and

bones like just full disclosure he's

he's he's he's borderline squatting this

is our house not his I just make a

single command of drop he drops the keg

and it explodes right at his feet you

just see this huge blast consume the

front of the house and what you don't

know what happens to Warrington he just

sort of blasts backward in through the

wreckage of the house shrapnel from the

shattered balcony flies everywhere and

the facade of the house just comes

tumbling down I would like I would like

DF and paltin to make dexterity saving

throws as the front of the house falls

down on top of you you know in the grand

scheme of things destroying your house

is almost as much fun taking you're used

to that 21 yep

close to that six okay paulten you are

you are caught in the collapse and

buried in rubble it's like coming down

he's looking at this building falling

I'm like yeah it seems about right

against the whips being like no right

okay so Paul second freezer now paltin

is buried completely under the rubble

and takes 47 points of damage

you guys this cloud erupts sound of

thunderous tricks of the house falling

down I know that sounds like everything

in the kitchen shakes and some stuff

falls off the counters yeah and like I

feel like she looks at the pie and it's

like done like like roof beds or am i

buried under like tons and tons of

rubble or is it buried under rubble

there is no sign of you underneath the

wrecked facade of the house and you can

see into interior chambers specifically

[Music]

the you can see into the clearly into

the tap room into the common room the

hall and part of waffles den is

completely now open on one side the

turret which was right adjacent to the

balcony also took the brunt of some

punishment and you just kind of hear it

sort of crack-tip and lean forward over

the street all this stuff comes crashing

down and the dust settles you just hear

[Laughter]

yes when you come out you see the front

of the house is now lying down on the

street in piles I'm so I just like I'm

just gonna walk up like just like this

with the pie I'm just like saundra the

dinosaurs sniffs it the Tyrannosaurus

Rex

not yours it's not poisoned I promised I

was gonna poison it but then you didn't

kill us so you know just zona truth just

being honest

is it blueberry no it's cherry Thanks

life is hard for everyone and we're all

struggling make everything better

it does smell remarkably good straik

says that in pulse like even the coils

on the the webs loosened so that you're

no longer bound she rushes to the pile

where she thinks Melton might be in

surprise

yeah yeah it's a big pile I would say

sorry about your house but lettuce you

know you seem really distraught I mean

why don't you all come in and we can

just have a nice chat I mean for what's

left of the house like we have tables

and what we did we can talk to right

I'll get the ring back

I'm all right good know what dude Wow I

can't believe you're all right who is

Warrington oh man we could tell you so

many stories perhaps over a warm pie cut

to everybody clustered in the kitchen

since the tap rooms in rekt again I'm no

longer buried right yeah you you get

excised avenged eventually by evil and

and pulled it she pull once she finds

some sign of you like an arm she just

starts pulling you up with her

phenomenal strength cool see no and yes

lady like a power something you see like

it why is she like a god what's her deal

are you asking or you just trying to

divine that by looking at her mm-hmm I'm

kind of divining it by looking at her

but also talking out loud because I have

no filter so she she is a she is an

armored goddess on a Tyrannosaurus Rex

so you can see worked into the design of

her of Alice andhe's armor and

the armor of her bodyguards on the

pterodactyls are maze-like patterns and

symbols that you've seen before

suggesting Tao alright you worship

it's Alice sanda sorry Alice you can

also hurt you may also refer to her as

lady Rhea Burton says the woman on the

triceratops these are too many fancy

titles welcome to the chicken poi coffin

aka the Waffle House aka a pile of

rubble mm-hmm

again yeah some some papers sort of

float down and they're all like des

papers just I'm sure DF informs her and

all the other murderers where the winter

oh sorry are you planning to stay on

your quote/unquote high horse your

Tyrannosaurus Rex are you going - what's

your no I've did this mountain areum

all right still on the high horse though

right oh absolutely

all right dee Ethel try to regale as

much information as you can with

everything that they've been through and

everything that's around here along with

trying to discuss with alisande any

possibilities or information they could

exchange back and forth on how they

could even attempt off in to find the

ring of winter or where to start looking

or how to get there because it's in a

different plane of existence as far as

we know this is gonna be a very

collaborative effort if we want to make

this happen

alessandra meals and begins to pray and

she summons uptown alright you have seen

images of ab tau represented in statues

in child and what is me I met him didn't

I you met him in a fashion in a dream

what you think is a dream maybe in a

maze that that individual steps before

you out of nothing looks momentarily

disoriented and kind of disapproving of

the surroundings but then you see a

smile a faint smile cross his face when

he realized he's in the company of an

old friend and where I was amazed you

remember those dreams you guys never

talked about those he learned he took

see he looks at you Alyce andhe and says

warmly with with an undercurrent of you

wouldn't say frustration but maybe bad

timing

that I was having such a good day and

about you he'll take you up he'll take

you up by the hand a Lassonde so that

you're not kneeling and he embraces you

warmly it's good to see you friend it's

been a very rough day milord I'm so

sorry to hear that are you at peace no

what can I do to help

we seek the ring of winter that was

formerly worn I see mortals and their

playthings

it never ends Holland's just kind of

like yeah I was really scary we're kind

of having a moment don't need the

running commentary and he says oh is

that cherry pie it's actually really

good like I don't like her but her pie

is delicious he sort of looks at you and

mm-hmm man so he'll try a piece of the

pie he'll cut it with the knife

he'll plop it down on the plate some of

it sort of lands on the floor and then

he just has a sort of awkward moment

like no I'm not picking that up and then

he just sort of sweeps it with his

sandaled foot underneath a table so that

nobody steps on it and then he'll put it

down on the table sit in the chair and

start eating it and confirm that it is

indeed a very good pie like it's too

close to him and it's just like she's

like really happy that he likes it and

he'll put a hand he'll put his hand on

yours el-assad and he says I want

nothing more than peace in your life and

if I can guide you in that direction

through this crazy maze in which we all

find ourselves then I will yes but you

do realize you do have to deal with the

matter outside of this city there's a

war being waged on these people now

yes he's I see you know artists was very

much like them you remember right he was

as much trouble as any adventurer I've

ever met

I don't I warned you adventurers I got

it over my head it's it's a lot I could

it hurts I didn't know what to do and

now I've got an army and a dinosaur I

don't know how to stop it now follow

your heart and try to be kind and things

will work out you know in a way artists

is still with us and will always be with

you

and he would wanted he would want to

know that the the ring is in safe hands

he was obsessed about that silly thing

do you think it forced him to be yes

you're right

I'm sorry I destroyed your house that

attacked you Oh

dad don't worry about it yeah you you

can summon powers that's pretty like

thank you for not killing us that's a

that's that's really scary thank you my

pie

yes gestures to like the house like this

is just stuff stuff you can be build

Alton's gonna walk up to her be like

like I said we all suffer loss we lose

loved ones some of us don't summon

armies and wage wars on cities and

destroy things some of us just get real

sad but you know what everyone copes in

their own way I cry every night she

cries every night so what about you

paladin what about me I don't think I

like your tone a lot she pretend she's

happy when she's not yeah cows like

relate and relate I don't like really as

an command yeah let's commiserate on all

of our misery I just you know thought I

really knew a lot about who I was and

I'm finding out that maybe I don't

that's why I'm grateful for up to-- he

shows me the way and every maze has dead

ends

that's just life it's like racist raise

our hands

OOP doubt you do you make them mazes in

signal just a question yeah definitely

the time to ask that I just know I've

saw him in a dream that no one else has

talked about I'm just saying yeah

definitely definitely the time to talk

about he says oh no those have been

around long before I came into existence

all right well I just wanted to make

sure that I was amazed and I would like

to hear about everyone else's dreams I'm

just saying that's it I think we're all

sad that's off I'm not sad I'm I'm

totally fine

uh-huh you're if you're don't of truther

again

now that I don't think it's necessary

everyone deserves their secrets some

more than others I guess poignant Lee

looks at D yes refuses to make eye

contact OOP towel look a little stand-up

he'll put the plate on the sink and the

the cutlery back in the sink and then

he'll turn to Alessandra and says I'm

sure I can be more of assistance to you

if there's is there anything I can do

while I'm here I mean is in the right

direction well why don't you deal with

why don't you tell your friend your elf

friend to hold off on burning the city

to the ground until the ring can be

properly located I forgot about the

burning part yeah oops

all fire and it sounds like it sounds

like you have the workings of a plan -

maybe track down the whereabouts of the

ring before this is all over so that's

good that's good and in the meantime

I'll just clean up a little bit around

here and be on my way and I think that

you all together

you can all be better people by yeah and

then I think he disappears well those

are just sounds like you need to deal

with that look if we happen to get ahold

of this ring or find it should we get a

hold of you or what was your friend's

name the elf if we ever meet them maybe

we can let them know about the ring rain

elray Elrond Elrond got it so if we

happen to know anything or hear anything

we can let the right people know DF and

actually all of you can make a just make

an intelligence history checked it's a

hard check but there's an outside chance

you may have heard of al rain before

history yeah history more like crushed

it 11 great and okay check it six okay

yeah you've never heard that dude before

right

okay well if we ever meter C&L raised

especially rain el rain with especially

with anything that has to do with the

ring of winter can let them know or even

better we'll try out it you know this is

clearly a far more personal matter for

you and I understand that I need to go

and see about 5,000 elves about a

burning city right please don't mention

I've already done enough damage

I appreciate the pie or just say that it

was done by acquisitions incorporated as

you as you leave Alice on does two

bodyguards the pterodactyl writers

they're still waiting outside sort of

guarding the outside of the house to

make sure nobody intervenes but the the

druid woman in the robe Nylund ray she

is with you Alessandra she seems a

little unsatisfied with the outcome but

she's not going to do anything or say

anything you just read it in her eyes

like man we just came 3,000 miles

but she turns to the rest of you and

says lady Rhea Burton is immortal it

would behoove you to remember that we're

not going to let this slide some more

PI's make it better

what helped to appeal to my better

judgment speak more applies just me just

make as many pies then still says we'll

be back don't doubt that for a moment

seems to be a theme this season and

that's where we'll stop and all of us
