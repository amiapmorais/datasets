[Music]

oh yeah hey how's it going know what

you've been up to Oh crying all weekend

Chris has been playing with dolls

[Music]

this is my yarn you want e.d she might

come into play before we get this show

on the road let us just say that Nate

had an emergency come up last minute he

might be able to join us

but he and I did exchange a number of

messages so I know exactly what's on

Calkins mind and I will try to portray

him as accurately as oh that's so nice

he wants to save the party and express

it and I love for all of them take off

that ring God exactly like what I think

Nate would do with Politan that's pretty

much what he said yeah okay all right

previously the party ventured into the

vein of the night serpent den dark and

shortly after they arrived were beset by

scores of you want II then things kind

of went downhill from there when Strix

was shot full of arrows and knocked into

a pool of blood that had transformed

into the face of the lady of pain and

ended up in the mazes an extra

dimensional prison where the lady of

pain banishes those who do not deserve

to exist in the multiverse shortly

thereafter

evylyn was swallowed by a giant den dar

the night serpents statue and went

tumbling down its gullet ending up in a

tomb

a dark and forlorn tomb by herself where

she saw the bodies of her three

companions and their souls rising up out

of them only to get sucked away into the

soul monger and she knew she knew that

the only hope for those souls would be

to get to the soul monger and shatter it

thus freeing them not long thereafter

d/f got spirited away to a winter water

deep where he saw an evil future version

of paltin under this way or in league

with the rain of winter the entire city

engulfed in snow and he also noticed

that he had angel wings that had been

torn off his body and he met Strix who

was picking through garbage in an alley

but it turned out not to be Strix it

turned out to be a host of cranium rats

wearing Strix his garb and all that the

rats had to say was we are many you are

one before they disbanded and fled des

presence

wondering where Strix was that's when a

door in the alley opened and a dark

serpentine form assured him inside and

it turned out to be one of these a you

auntie woman with the lower body of a

servant who beckoned him into the

darkness saying that if he wanted to

save his friends he would have to become

one of them paltin meanwhile tried to

distinguish himself in the battle by

using his icy fist to hammer on the gong

but all that did was drop a bunch of

portcullises sealing off the room almost

denying Miranda her escape from the

chamber that Miranda was able to with

Paulson's help get past the portcullises

and escape the fame with two of her

vegetate me army buddies and dragon bait

and waffles and Simon Miranda as you

leave as you lead the party away from

the feign back down into the dark

tunnels you eventually make it back to

the room where this these sort of

bloated zombies were milling around all

these sort of alchemical experiments and

you see the murdered body of a you want

II who was killed by that syringe that

you injected him with you also see an

open door leading back out into some

caves but as you spill out the zombies

don't seem to pay any mind there's sort

of ambling about the room oblivious to

their surroundings for the most part but

you can see paltin does not slow down he

just sort of angrily kind of paces

across the room heading toward the exit

with my babies yeah you got your veggie

babies and dragon baits got the baby

Triceratops under one arm and waffles

sort of by the caller with the other

hand just sort of ushering her along

she's still sort of dragging her heels a

little bit this giant al bear wanting to

go back the other way

so it's a bit of a fight but you head

out through the door into a damp cave

which if you remember it has a tunnel

leading out to the surface with the city

but then there's another sort of opening

in the side of the cave that seems to

lead deeper into the darkness and it's

flooded with water and there are a

couple boats on the shore of this sort

of flooded cavern paltin gives the boats

a glance thinking to himself for a

moment but then decides no it's time to

leave what do you do I think I'm gonna I

think Miranda would go with paltin okay

there's no way that she would be able to

go through this temple on her own

Humanite yeah and I had forgot to

mention she was recently after using her

spell to blast a you wan tee back into a

teleportation arch later she saw this

halfling figure whom she remembered as

one of her travel for one of her

adventuring companions

Typho but he had been turned into a

snake-like creature thoughts of him

still raced through your mind now as you

get farther and farther away from the

you aunty feign you can't imagine what

he must have undergone to become the

creature he is now and there's still

serie that's right yes and your other

missing companion you don't know where

she's gone but as you follow paltin out

of the tunnel you emerge about a hundred

feet later back out into the tropical

ruined city of Oh Moo everything is sort

of blanketed in a thin layer of white

ash which is no longer falling from the

sky and you can hear the rush of a river

pouring through the city nearby you can

see the palace its crumbling walls

looming up above behind you and paltin

just sort of takes in the air and stares

up at the ceiling and sort of holds up

his hand with the ring of winter and

just sort of clenches it into a fist

[Music]

finger into a sign really hard he turns

around when he he feels the pain and

he's got his little puppet Simon beside

him and Simon sort of furrows his brow

and stares at you with a scowl and

paulten says well they're all dead mmm

no you don't know that you don't know

that they're dead guess that's what I

get for being a nice guy okay you don't

know that they're dead that seems like a

very far leap there are no bodies

they're not dead and tell there are

bodies and he says I hate this

place

well don't give up on your friends so

easily I think that I think that we

should rest do you want to rest for a

minute he looks around and says yeah

okay yeah okay I'm going to with my two

veget pygmies just sort of hunched over

and scout out a good place for us to set

up our glow main court and I'm gonna

cast loading court to have a little

bubble around us can I fit everyone in

that yeah yeah okay okay and describe

for me what you see as sort of being in

this bubble inside the bubble it's very

sparse but there's it's sort of like a

shimmery wall sort of like an actual

soap bubble where you can see out but

it's hard to see in it looks like maybe

a mirage on the outside but inside

there's like plusher carpet of grass it

grows thicker in here so it's softer

when you sit down and it's nicer and

it's shaded too so it's cool it's not as

hot as it is outside okay

paltin will come into your glowing cord

and he'll sit down and you can see he's

not so much looking at the the the ring

of winter now but the ring on his other

hand which is a protective band and he

seems to be staring at it deeply so do

you know much about the elven ring that

you're wearing he tears his eyes away

from that from the ring he's looking at

and back at the ring of winter and he

says no what do you know about it a

little too much I think you know it was

abandoned by my people they can't really

uh I don't think anyone knew how to

destroy it it was sent away but it was

sent away for a reason I don't think I

don't think it's safe I think it might

be hurting it what do you mean I think

that there's something trapped in it I

don't know what I really I don't know

too much about it I know that it's

dangerous and I think that you should be

very careful you're just saying that

because you want it for yourself no I

don't want it I will not take that I

love symmetrical items and I will do

pretty much anything for a magical am

but that artifact is not no it's not

good it's not if I were you but I'm not

you

and with that he just sort of stares

into the ring of winter and as he does

you can see there's sort of this icy

blue fire kind of playing around the

corners of his eyes you feel drawn to it

don't you know that's cool

oh yeah you can just take it off and

you'd feel fine yeah but I don't feel

like it sure okay keep it on as long as

you want but um and he looks around at

the rest of the group Simon and dragon

bait and waffles and your veggie pygmies

and he said so I guess this is this is

it now all right this is us this is this

is all that's left at the waffle crew I

don't I don't know Alton I don't think

your friends are dead I really I really

um well I couldn't help him I tried I

even hit the gong nothing happened

Walton I really don't think the gong was

something that did but listen don't give

up on your friends that easily they're

your friends right don't you care about

them I do where did you doing anywhere

well everything everything dies I guess

except me I'll live forever sure that's

not weird okay Strix as you are hanging

out in the mazes with your butt with

your buddy OOP Tao it was a sort of

short short portly man with a talisman

and amulet from would circular shape yes

shaped like a maze just make a

perception check for me all right

eleven okay

oh that's good I love the okay you

you're just sort of staring off

wondering what to do next do you want to

say or do anything at this point in time

yeah so after where I left off

she's gonna walk up to the puppets and I

first first she's gonna save - don't

move - OOP - cuz she wants that maze cuz

she's like passed spaz tricks wanted

that and I wanted don't go anywhere

but she's gonna walk up to the puppets

and she's just like she's like thanks

for a second that she's gonna give up

again because she thinks she's trapped

but she's just angry just like really

angry like and this isn't a normal

emotion for her like she doesn't usually

like understand like really like rage

but she's like angry

he's like trembling before she even

realized that yeah she's just like

shaking like like and it maybe if

there's like some kind of like

irrational like foul metochi thing or

something where it's like kind of fire

coming off of her so she just like like

carefully picks up the puppet

he puts uh she puts evylyn and Paulson

both on her shoulders

okay palton kind of falls off as soon as

Paulson falls off she's just like you

damn drunken shot and she's clearly like

got a routine with these puppets like

she's done this before and she just

picks up a little da puppet and just

like holds it next just like this and

just looks at OOP towel and says we're

going to get out of here

little puppet evylyn kind of pats or

cheek lovingly thank you that's right

okay before and it's weirding me out but

this one really hard to so like all

right yeah so his stuffing is bulging a

little bit yeah okay

when you turn back to Utah you can see

that Luke Tao has risen to his feet he

was sitting on a log before and is

looking out toward the jungle and he

says oh not again and it's only then you

were so sort of oblivious in your anger

that you did not hear the heavy

crunching of gigantic footfalls coming

toward you and you hear breaking tree

limbs and there's this moment before it

appears where you know or it suddenly

use the memory comes back to you of what

it is and as the trees split open coming

at you is a giant

Hut on chicken feet oh oh no oh no no I

would like its roll initiative her like

little fire that was above her just goes

actually shaking de 1818 the mobile KFC

Strix you can see that there is a

crooked chimney that comes out at the

top of this thing that's billowing black

smoke ah and you don't see any doors in

its sides but it's basically a hexagonal

six-sided hut perched on top of these

chicken legs and what do you do as its

toward you and it's about 30-40 feet

tall yeah and say she's good she's gonna

stand her ground this the mazes don't

work like normal places and she does

know this so she's just gonna stand

there and kind of look at and say if

you're in there I didn't do anything all

right

OOP Tao will run away he does her yeah

with all of his sort of big burly

flabbiness he just runs past you leaving

you to face the hut alone she's not

gonna run yeah she just looks at him she

goes you're a power what kind of power

are you what I told you a thousand times

I am NOT a power I am a shopkeeper well

your shop probably sucks yes and he says

if you don't run your hut is going to

kill us

no I'm not running and she like slams

our staff into the ground and there's

fire coming from the table all right

Diaz puppet on top of her witch hat so

it's just like sitting on the brim okay

the hut comes over to you and brings one

of its a big chicken feet up to stomp

you flat can I do how much rebuke you

can as a reaction after it damages you

all right if it hits you see where they

roll I rolled a 16 total yes it's okay

yeah so you feel the crushing weight of

your Hut or Baba Yaga's hut or somebody

saw stomping down on you with its big

chicken foot evylyn you're staring at a

control panel this device standing

between you and your friends mm-hmm it's

in this stone room with these pipes sort

of sticking out of the walls and little

bits of gray goo seeping out of the

pipes there are some weird diagrams on

the walls and you see a gold lever a red

dial a blue dial a red button and a blue

button and for the first time in a long

time you wish you wish you didn't have

to deal with this kind of thing this

isn't something you can kill or smite

yeah so I imagine you know even scum

like Terminator charging down the hall

to this point yes and she's got the egg

bomb yes in her in her hand and I

imagine she gets to that control panel

and she kind of just charges up to it

and she's got the egg and she's like

and she kind of like takes him deep

breaths and she looks at the wall and

she's kind of frantically like looking

at these symbols and she's she's looking

at the egg and she's looking at the

control panel and she kind of like

heavily just like leans on it and stares

down and kind of like takes a deep

breath she sets the egg down on the

floor and she just takes like four steps

back and she sits down cross-legged if

she can sit cross-legged I'm not even

sure if she can anymore she approximates

sitting cross-legged yes she could do

that she kind of just like tries to take

what would be a deep breath as she

breathes she's still like you can tell

her heart's just racing and she just her

hands are clenched and she just wants to

like smash things she's trying so hard

and she starts humming and she goes hmm

[Music]

and she's trying really hard just to

calm down and at this point Chris you

decide how this goes but what I imagine

she's doing she still has inspiration

from when she and strix

sang that song together and so what

she's doing is she's trying to sing that

song to herself to just like calm

herself down and get to a heightened

state of understanding and then once she

kind of finds that that silence she

prays and she says Lysander it's me

evylyn your servant I I don't know what

to do and I I don't know why you you

blessed me with these people but their

souls are in danger and I know you don't

want them to go to evil but I don't know

how to stop it

so if you could just help I I'm nothing

without you I have no strength I have no

understanding and I know that only with

your help will I have any idea with

those symbols on the wall

mean so please bless your servant help

me save them

Wamba what do you say to her okay

so I want to do a performance I want to

do it connect come to a performance I

want it I wanted I want to try answer

back to her as her God like this is God

I do that what do you say I say I say

Evelyn you are so good and great and I

wanted to tell you something the word of

of your god I don't have any dice Holly

didn't give me any so and the fact that

he mispronounced her name she goes from

like peaceful Zen cross-legged praying

to like eyes of doom staring up at

wherever that voice came from when you

look you can see that one bot is in the

room with you he is he has basically

stepped out from behind the control

panel and is standing next to it and

next to the egg and it's him and he's

trying to make this booming voice but

he's just in the room with you I dive

tackle him over the egg I do not want

him to touch that I try to I try to

block every but I go like this alright I

rip his arm off have the two of you rule

initiatives oh I don't see them I don't

know where they was gonna say there's

definitely some dice in that house I got

a six okay I hate you Ross just kidding

I love you

oh did you

zero Chris I did not oh okay sorry God

here I come Tyson l8 okay well you are

actually the first to act when you see

the look in those eyes left the

determination the paladin's resolved you

fear for your little your little life so

just to describe your surroundings you

are in this room with slimy pipes

sticking out of the walls and there is a

what a mechanical console that you've

got your back to with some dials buttons

and a lever on it but then there is this

black egg about a foot tall made of

metal and it's got on one side a little

window through which you can see blue

light spilling out brightly and on the

other side it's got what appears to be a

clock with a little with a little hand

one one hand on it and behind evil and

you can see what appears to be an open

doorway into another chamber beyond and

you can see coming toward the two of you

in the darkness of that room are what

appear to be several giant forearmed

gargoyles hmm they are converging on

your location but you don't care I spit

in Anna's face Evelyn's face yeah oh and

in everyone's face all right so one buzz

attack is basically a Colucci

after you're in your direction evylyn so

great with that out of the way yeah you

don't even feel it it just sort of hits

your or whatever and keep trawling

trophies

yeah smash you you come out of what you

want to make a grapple check yeah cuz my

main goal is just don't let him touch

the egg okay in that case go ahead and

make your strength athletics check and

Ross you can make a dexterity acrobatics

check to contest her all right

ten sixteen yeah ah

evylyn sketchy yes can I just oh yeah I

say at least buy me dinner first do I

don't get to do anything other than

grappling right that is your action yeah

so you can do a bonus action or take the

rest of your movements but as you grab

him and you look over your shoulder you

too can see that those four or four

armed guard whales that followed you

down the pit have gained on you and are

closing on your location there is a

doorway between you and them I shake

wumba roughly I say what do you know

about this console I don't know I hold

his little face up to it and I say which

button one boy you look at the console

and you see a blue dial dial turning

left or right do both rapidly you know

those diagrams on the wall Anna yeah

there's a little light on yeah yeah well

as soon as he turns the dial and

direction that light changes to another

one of the diagrams and behind you that

open doorway disappears as the room that

the gargoyles in revolves changes

position so now you and Wamba are sealed

off in this room by the rotating chamber

behind you are they sorry you're gonna

describe more buttons are there more

buttons oh my god is your grappled as

soon as you touch that thing I pull you

away by

yeah I'm you're under action one that

you're only able to tinker with one of

them so you used just want to know where

to run my forearm across next right

which Chris which indicator light is on

now that would be indicator light number

two and so the door with the gargoyles

has closed that's correct the room that

the gargoyles is in seems to have

revolved so that there's no longer an

access to you do I see mmm

do I see a door in front of me now you

see no exits of any kind oh good

okay yeah oh that's worrisome yeah

you're welcome

you are cut off I so just for the people

at home who maybe haven't seen this

diagram there are little symbols one of

them is a star one of them is kind of

too squiggly lines like like a tilde two

till these next to each other that's the

one that my we originally were facing so

if you're standing at the console and

you were looking ahead

perhaps if it's oriented correctly that

would be what's in front of you evylyn

thinks that might have something to do

with the Jets of slime so she's really

worried that now now that we're in

indicator 2 that might be opening

something with Jets of slime she's

really not into slime the other symbol

is the one that seemingly was the door

that the gargoyles were coming through

had like a two circles with a line over

it symbol and then in the the COG to the

right there's a circle like a chain-link

looking thing almost and then a

something that looks like a mustache so

even is just desperately trying to

figure out what those symbols mean

because she basically understands that

this console controls rotating rooms

that have certain doors between each

other and she needs to figure out which

symbol means so longer so that she can

get to that right as she is pulling

Lamba away from the console she the

Roomba hi

you is making a terrible ruckus as it

turns but it does eventually come to a

stop so that you're just looking at a

bare wall where the opening used to be

but the revolutions have stopped okay

and at this point I need to flip over to

D F so before we do anything from here

Chris we just heard from Nate and he is

now available to rejoin us if that's

okay

oh very good absolutely all right I will

let him know ya miss some good and

now we know how sad he is yes excellent

so the overlay will be messed up on the

stream and things so forgive that but

you know I love all our players here

right all right okay

all right so if you want to go to the

next turn I'm the worst human Elton's

only kind of dead

all right cool I guess I guess I can

just leave again carry on I'll bring you

up to speed momentarily Nate on where

pollens at yeah but right now DF you are

on a it feels like a Devon kind of

you've been sort of ushered to it and

you just sort of sprawled on it and it

seems to be made

bass licks and you feel your body and

face being caressed by three you want he

women one of whom is the one who say one

of whom is the one fen fossa who's been

talking to you you can also hear about

the room just the sound of snakes

rattling and hissing and she says bras

me see does not deserve his meant you

shall replace him what makes you think I

have an ancient soul

she says can't you sense it no no I've

only ever been me so much more ra's me

she can sense it he fears it and that's

one of us you will use your power over

her what to free your friends as all you

need all you want is this soul and

you'll help me save them I want you to

leave

you know more than you let on snake

no there's nothing I wouldn't do to help

them I know they would never forgive me

which is why I will not give up many

part of myself to you but you must know

they will die no they won't

not ever not well I still draw breath

and like whatever stone thing they have

like he's like starts forcing yeah okay

yeah you pull yourself off of it and

away from them and you can see that they

don't they're not grabbing you in any

sense so you have no trouble getting to

your feet all right so then soon as I

get to my feet I will still stand quite

firm in just a very stern face go and

we'll continue to address I'm saying

replacing brass and EC is not enough we

will destroy Roz Nietzsche you want a

leader you've got one get me back to my

friends help me help them and we will

get rid of Roz nisi make a persuasion

check come on

I have some points in it 18 okay they

will or offend also well come up to you

and she will sort of grab your face with

her hands gently and just sort of cup

your chin in her palms

she just sort of strokes the sides of

your face very gently and says this

would be so much prettier with scale

that gif will like cost swat away her

hands and then she what do you do that

she says but how can I resist yeah

there's a ended attitude or you didn't

see one in the darkness but almost on

cue when she says that the door seems to

sort of illuminate itself so so holding

onto Strix as Rose gave to me that takes

a single step towards of stops and I

looks back at her do I believe her make

an inside check ten you can't tell it's

dark you know her face is masked in

shadow is there is any other exit or

entrance out of this rumors are just

that one door it appears to be the only

door you see is the one that is

illuminated before you there's nothing

with your human eyes that you can see in

the darkness beyond that all right so we

without much more to go on like yeah is

a it's a very like a quick hastened

walked towards that door yeah and then

try to open it up okay when you get to

the door it opens on its own before you

and from the shadows the fan thathe says

we can't help you you must face and as

the door opens you see another room

beyond and this room is lit by

flickering torches you can see that in

the middle of the rectangular room is an

altar like slab of stone

there's blood coursing off of it

spilling out of the body of a dead

figure laid out on top of it

appears to be a tea fling and then as

you come into the room you can see that

or on the on the sides are other slabs

of stone and there are figures in the

dimness lying on those as well but

they're not bleeding out the figure on

the altar is not only blinging out but

the blood is pooling or into troughs

around the base of the altar and being

funneled out of the room through holes

in the wall but the figure the thing

that's most alarming to you is you see

in this room the figure of Rossi see

this man a serpent a flaming blade his

face and arms wrapped in bandages but

through it you can see on his forehead a

blue triangle and he slithers toward you

what do you do so what place will have

it with me ever since I got here am I

still like have completely like

everything I was wearing all that all

right so then deer-like takes off his

pack and like drops it to the ground

that's its full way just plunk down and

then he'll like drops tricks his robes

and hat on top of that and then pull out

gutter and then just full-on sprint just

right Adam all right you can feel gutter

wake up in your hand it's been asleep

for a long time and yes your sword is

awake and hungry for blood paltin yeah

you are out back out in the city of omen

having left the Fane of the night

serpent behind realizing your friends

were gone

there wasn't much reason to stay you've

still got Miranda and dragon bait Simon

and all the animals with you okay

you are basically sitting in this

temperature controlled almost fade like

sylvan space that Miranda has created

with her elven magic it's similar to

your waffle hut in many respects and

that is sort of creating a protective

domed area and you have been lamenting

the loss of your friends contemplating

your future you know that eh you'll live

forever because you have the ring of

winter be you've got one of the

protective rings that protects you from

the degenerative death curse and you're

not in any danger of losing any more

body parts or anything oh I have that

ring to okay you do so you're pretty

okay personally but now you're thinking

you know it might be time to contemplate

Paul toons future with no waffle crew

you're also highly suspicious that

Miranda wants that reign of winter but I

assume that she has assured you she has

no interest in that evil item oh I I

assume everyone wants it

it's pretty rad I mean who wouldn't want

it yeah so you're saying you're staring

around and the only thing you can smell

is dragon baits sense of failure Oh

so do I have so I just think they're

gone

do I think they're dead or they were all

either eaten by zdenda or the night

serpent

consumed by a pool of blood or spirited

away to some dark Debbie plane this was

after you slammed the gong and all the

propolis has dropped around you and

things looked pretty bleak so huh

yeah figure something out usually

there's someone else did you know well

Miranda is sitting across from you and

Miranda I mentioned last week that your

wounds that you had sustained from the

wanti arrows they're no longer present

but you still feel the damage you just

think that those those arrows may not

have been real it was all psychic damage

that you were taking and paltin you can

see that Miranda even though you saw her

get shot with multiple arrows she

doesn't seem to have any wounds visible

oh so you also have have healing powers

that's that's good to know

I mean I don't know how physical these

arrows were you know I mean it seems

weird but if you have healing properties

that's good because I might be in need

of a new crew so currently you know

scouting candidates you know doing

interviews it's really in the baby

stages right now but you know there's a

there's a there's a big hole and it it

hurts

so yeah just just a burn it out there no

pressure just no putting out feelers

good to know actually I'm pretty sure

most of my crew is dead too I know one

of them is a you want tea you remember

the the rogue I was yelling at you about

that's Typho and then the zerah zerah

died earlier the zero got eaten by a

t-rex Alton just like cuts robbed it's

like oh I don't know if two characters

can have that similar backstories that

might not work out for like the balance

we'll be in touch though well me okay

sure and then I go back to internal

sobbing okay okay Strix yes I'm here all

right

you wake up sometime later you are lying

in the ground with a giant chicken foot

imprint on top of you

but the hut is gone sorry my computer

got turned off now it's back I don't

know okay did you catch what I just said

no okay you were wake up having been you

don't know how long you were out okay

you wake up in basically a giant chicken

footprint great I'm flat on your back

alright no indication of where the hut

is no indication of where the hut is no

no and all you hear are sort of jungle

insects and birds and things are my

puppets okay yeah there was sort of kind

of pressed into the mud around you

except for Paul tonight you packed away

oh I'm sorry

the evil and one is particularly dirty

evil and sold press wait should she just

made its Foreman she's like she can do

magic right she she tries to do

prestidigitation and if it works she's

just like yeah okay okay

where's OOP Tao

you don't see him it's the worst power

no wonder he disappeared alright I will

take stock of my area and see where the

chicken hunt went you can easily follow

the tracks of the chicken house all

right I will do that make a make a

perception check to see if you'd notice

anything else all right 15 the chicken

Hut has done a fair amount of damage as

it's crashed through the jungle makes it

very very easy to follow and you notice

hooked on a tree about 30 yards from

where you were mashed into the ground is

OOP Taos talisman oh that's what I

wanted anyway he's useless fake pass

tricks wanted me to have this

look your evil and I'll hold evylyn up

so that she can grab it because I'm

pretending she's flying with all right

yes

all right so okay I'll look at this

talisman be like all right Future Passed

maybe not real Strix let's see if you

were barmy or not when you look at the

talisman you see that carved into the

wood are is this maze this this maze

made out of curved walls make a inside

check all right uh-huh

five okay do something there's something

about the maze that's weird but you

can't put your finger on it alright um

oh you know what after this I'm gonna

use my inspiration and roll again okay

excellent it's fairly coming out it's

coming out twenty episodes later fifteen

okay with that roll you know yes very

good use of inspiration as you as you're

sort of tracing through the maze just

learn with your mind you see it's got a

center and ask of all these raideen

passages many of them ending in dead

ends but there is no exit alright which

is their exit to the maze there's nuts

so Trix is mine she's going to assume

that that means a portal

well it's certainly symbolic of where

she's finding herself now alright in a

place with no X's is there right is

there anything else on this thing you

check it both sides no but you're also

reminded of something that you were told

import and ions are about OOP Tao and

that his he will grant favor upon one

who can trace their path through the

maze that's right he's the god of mazes

even though he sucks so tricks is gonna

like shake it a little bit and just like

maybe like lick it just to be sure okay

she's gonna follow them in splinter

she's gonna follow the maze going she's

tracking the maze like

pinger with her tongue or what with her

tongue her way through the maze again

she's confounded by the problem that

there's no exit like he add the edge of

the circle the talisman has is just

solid all the way around there's no can

she make way out

how would she like to do that I'm going

to take the scissors by my belt and just

wherever I think I am in the maze mm-hmm

if I can find like an exit I'm just

gonna damage so you start to couch into

the loser's and as you do the air in

front starts to slice open creating this

jagged gash in into some other dimension

and the gash kind of like it flaps like

it's been torn whoa yeah I mean can i I

don't want to just jump in just from

experience so she's just gonna be like

huh just stick her head in okay when you

stick your head in you see D F okay he

literally just runs right past you board

out yeah just make a perception check

okay

[Music]

[Laughter]

so dear you do not notice her before you

lock swords with rosin easy okay

well now that now that Ana so I'd like

let's see jarred roll initiative oh

right

much better thank you okay

and she's yelling like the puppets are

flying off of her she's like great Ross

what do you do

you are in the clutches of this radiant

paladin radiant

okay so can I just like II you can try

to slip through her grasp as an action

with a dexterity acrobatics check if you

want you just kind of make your bones

like all liquidy and just kind of yeah I

like first I get like just do what I can

to get myself a little jittery okay so

should I roll to like get out yes and

evil in you can try to hold on to him

with an athletics check oh it's not good

rolling good today six okay you slip out

of her grasp

okay five holes in the ground don't you

have like bonuses or anything it's a six

for sure I I haven't well I don't have

like wait hold on oh my character she

[Music]

well because I thought I didn't have it

anymore I thought I threw it out when I

thought I'd died we did - don't worry

yeah so you have Dexter you should have

dexterity acrobatics as a skill maybe

Dex is uh or if you don't have the skill

yeah sis plus three correct no I don't

have it no I don't I don't know what's

your what's your dexterity bonus it says

plus three so add that to your role okay

so nine okay dang it yes you slip out of

her grasp what do you do would be

movement that you have left your base

you're basically trapped in this room

with her but there are like pipe holes

up near the ceiling and there's

console there's this big egg on the

ground you can't do any actions okay I

reason with their way I'm confused

you're confused just I can help you more

if I'm not crushed and I kind of step

back please don't kill me I'm done

that's my plea okay yep

then next up is Evelyn so he says that

to me and then I kind of like is he

still

where is he in relation to the egg oh

this is a fairly confined room so but he

is close to you because he just sort of

slipped away he took a few paces back

and started to flag it wave his hands at

you he's probably like three feet away

from you three feet away from the

console and about five or six feet away

from the egg is he between me and the

egg you're sort of in a triangle okay so

he says that and I just kind of like

pump-faked him a little bit just get out

of my way do I flinch that's what I

wonder why should I roll you let's do a

roll fair flinch say I was that sense

fair for it just does that and then like

all she wants to do is just kind of pick

the egg back up and put it in her bag

to like get that safe and then she says

why on earth would I trust you of all

people because I'm all the people you

got she just kind of like rolls her eyes

and since he doesn't seem to be a threat

she turns her attention back to this

console and puzzle yeah that she just

prayed for understanding about and she's

kind of like did you hear me I tried to

do the voice again no she just like

kicks a rock at him okay

at this point in time you do hear

something both of you it's this like

something scraping in a tight confined

space and you can hear it coming toward

the mouth of one of the pipes

in the ceiling this sort of and then

there is this blurt as something comes

out of one of the pipes and lands on the

floor and it is a second one by okay

this surely is Eve ladies nightmare we

got two turns now sees this happen she

doesn't move she just looks at it like

this nineteen okay all right just you

know that emoji with flat eyes and a

flat mouths just yes Roz nice he comes

at you as you launch yourself propel

yourself at him he swings his sword his

flaming sword at you okay so he rolled a

sixteen i definitely dodged out of the

way okay and with his second cool flip

with his second swing he rolled a

twenty-one okay that one way okay come

on Katie dodge it right

so you taste eight damage plus eight

points of fire damage for a total of

sixteen which you've been reduced to

eight okay and then with this then with

his third attack third attack he rolled

a twenty not natural twenty just a total

twenty reared that one misses

and it does five slashing damage and

eight fire damage for a total of 13 okay

got it

still standing I am great then it is

your turn

all right so hurt a little bit more than

I was anticipating won't lie so after

like COD dodging after the first one

using on Kenny dodge to tries to just

other and like he got last

kinda like reeling back in the pain Diaz

looks back up at him but there's a

little horn by his mouth and he just

blows on it right into brass and you

sees fist okay remind me what's the

saving trip for that um I want to say it

was Constitution yep don't have my diem

guide on me I will check guys figured

you see I think it's 15 do 15 yes okay

so you blast him yep and he failed his

save so I thought I got Grande pass you

ran past her so you did yes so as you as

you blast the horn Strix is yelling

attitude that you can't hear her alright

how many how many DX's was it again 5 to

6 is 5 to 6 yeah great oh that's pretty

good that's pretty good

22 22 right and yeah this washes over

him I need you to roll percentile dice

to see if your horn explodes okay please

nose blow d ya wouldn't want anything

worse to happen already

I'm good eighty okay huh

that was scary though I was skirt yeah

I'm always scared all right

next step is Holly nah you stick your

head in you can see that you're staring

in a room there is a dead body on a

altar that's bleeding out and it's blood

is being funneled out of the room you

can also see that DF is locked in mortal

combat with Rodney C and his flaming

sword I'm gonna throw up a little first

okay up as a free action yeah um guide

he can't that Sky's got a big sword he

can't uh uh okay

hmm hmm I need more I need more thinking

time what is what is the distance this

room how big is this room

this room is about thirty feet across

and about 20 feet wide

okay so it's pretty big uh oh my god

okay I'm so scared right now

uh can I just like scream at I'm just

gonna scream I'm just gonna scream be

like polymorphous like all right and

he's got to make a saving throw ah okay

he rolled a natural 20 on his safe Oh

balls

so your spell plays around Rose neesee a

little bit magical lights blah blah blah

and I still have I still have a phone I

can still miss you step yes okay uh wait

um no because you cast a spell it's too

high level okay but I did scream yes and

and DF you heard her no problem

and yes Strix has half in and half out

of this rent in space yeah I'm guessing

I kind of when I saw him she threw up

little bit and came out of it okay so

now she's flopped out onto the floor

okay and she's like stop and you can

tell she tried to cast polymorph which

is like just to save any situation but

it didn't work

okay paltin and miranda what do you want

to do after you've rested in this

gleaming blade how how much how am I

feeling how am i doing like up in up in

the old noggin you're wondering miranda

has tried to tell you that you shouldn't

necessarily think that your friends are

dead uh-huh that they may still be out

there you didn't actually see them you

don't get torn to pieces or anything

right now

now having reflected a little bit you're

wondering if what she's saying has any

merit that maybe they are still there

and you abandoned them great so I'll ask

like so do we have a say like a plan of

action or is this like is this like the

new home or something uh no too small to

be a home nothing else to do so okay I

guess we could go back see I'm sure

they're fine so I can I can pass without

graces sure why not cheer let's get down

to the boats so plan going forward don't

don't do anything stupid

hmm I never do I know that's not quite

true

we don't read into another gun as you're

talking you can see that dragon bait is

gone an awful little ways and he's just

kind of planted his sword into the soft

ashen ground and is looks like he's

meditating or praying to his God or

something it seems to be a ritual that

he does but he's being very quiet about

it

but he hears you talking and then a

Pyxis sort of walks over to you and you

can see he smells like wood smoke do I

remember what that means you can make a

insight check wisdom insight check just

this wisdom if you don't have the

insight skill which I don't well that's

a 19 okay you recall that that's his

sort of scent of piety and devotion of

commitment to his faith of a belief in a

higher power and whatnot and he looks at

you and then he picks up a little

dinosaur and he sort of takes waffles by

the collar

he takes waffles by the collar and walks

off we're just a way do I do I have like

an inkling of what he's thinking Roy

yeah based on what he's doing you think

that he is he believes it's important

for the waffle crews sanity to make sure

that these animals are not placed in

harm's way and he is going to task

himself to guarding them until your safe

return so I thought I see that I'm just

like mommy and I spend celery to run

after them yeah yeah I'm gonna keep

potato celery with the boot to be

okay yes so dragon bait sees this budget

paid me with a boot on his head

following him a few paces behind and

doesn't seem bothered by it in fact it

kind of slows down his face a little bit

to let celery catch up and then they go

marching off together

my buddy hope I see you again soon

you see potato look at you like you

gotta be kidding me right you

let him live and you're gonna take me to

my death that's me I need one thing I

can trust and it's just this clump of

mosques that's alive alright the clump

of moss will hug you tightly and not let

go okay and you descend back down into

the swampy tunnel that takes you to a

cavern that has an opening through the

dungeon and a watery passage through a

wide cavern with boats on the shore you

want to go back toward the temple or do

you want to take the boats I'm going to

look to palton but I'm gonna say it

seems like we blocked ourselves off of

any kind of escape in the temple we

might want to take well I just I don't

know how to open that fellows and tie

foes in there and he's really good at

hiding and also stabbing he's really

good at stabbing and the stabby guy is

in the the not boat way that's correct

he's in the temple way boat sound good

let's take a boat first

I'll cast pretty sick pass without trees

okay so you quietly climb into a boat

and you think that one person can

basically man the oars or you can each

grab an oar but is probably easier if

one person does it okay I'm let it's

like alright cool I just now that yeah

paulten the thing you note as you make

your way as you start to make your way

down this waterway into this cave is

that it's very very dark

your human eyes don't normally let you

see Miranda seems to have no trouble

seeing where she's going you need a

light hmm

I mean I'd produce flame but I also

think that's dangerous in a wooden boat

hmm like I assume that if you see

something that wants to try and kill us

you'll let me know right

all right so Paul seems to sit in the

complete dark it is kind of like it's

not a nice cruise right now that's right

swish of the oars there's darkness and

dripping water all around you

and you trust that Miranda is taking you

to a happy happy place uh-huh okay

Miranda you are the only one that sees a

reptilian head rise up out of the water

and it's big this head its teeth its

mouth wide enough that it could probably

swallow a person whole and it comes up

it comes up very quietly at first and

then you just hear sort of the water

running off its scales and it's frill

but then when it opens its mouth that

kind of makes a sound do I know if it

has seen us is it like coming for us

yeah it is surfaced right beside the

boat and is now looming over you do I

hear this so yes you do you hear this

sound of this thing but you can't see

what it is

no I'm gonna just like point very slowly

in the direction and then I just I just

heard it yeah you can't see it I heard

like a general direction yes okay

Miranda as that is happening a second

head comes up over the side of the boat

than a third head and a fourth head and

finally a fifth head mistake oh my god

[Laughter]

do I have do I have any idea if there's

anywhere I can walk that is not this

water is and or is it just like nothing

total blackness absolute blackness you

see nothing but blackness cool are there

six heads now

there are five total five oh okay that's

much better

and that will bring us to oh I have a I

have a quote

yeah so let's say the hut were to spawn

on something moving would the hut move

that's a very good question

consult the holy text panic okay it's

Ana mobile dome oh so there's that so it

would be placed and then you would like

drift out of it and then I would end

cool okay I'm I just like so I'm aware

there's all these heads you know that

there is big creatures looming above you

there's water like dripping from their

teeth onto your face you just sense

there they're all butts surrounding you

now and obviously Miranda is very upset

the boat starts to wobble a bit as she

starts to fuss with the oars and prepare

herself for what could be a horrible

horrible experience and cool yeah so

next up is one ba this is this is this

is one but two by the way oh one but

number two alright so I'm in a room

there's no way out is a bunch of buttons

right there is a console with some

buttons on it I run out at night no I

was the one thing I accomplished my

stairs in your pack you don't see that I

was gonna smash buttons so you climb up

onto the console you can smash I was I

was technically blocking that because I

was addressing the console so I feel

like I would get some sort of attack

block of opportunity against what I just

want to smack him off the console I just

wanted to not touch

you can arming him but like hard mom our

stop shop pair I likes mom smack nope

nope do I have to roll against sir or do

I just let me just check something here

all right it is an action to shove not a

reaction so unless you don't so no you

can't actually shove him but you can

attack him Wow oh I mean I just hit him

basically but I'm looking at the flavor

of being a mom smell oh sure okay go

ahead and make an attack roll I'm gonna

hit him like with the flat of tree bein

like a fly so that's gonna be 17 what's

your AC your armor class Ross Schiff 16

so that hits if you just if you don't

want to do any real damage to him you

can just say it deals no damage it's

just a special you know an effect where

you can roll damage I don't really mind

damaging him okay I'm not trying to kill

him or anything

this isn't because you're basically

using it as a club but to did nothing to

you only one but one did neither of

these one bizarre the one that much is

clear that one is waffle waffle spill

roll your damage will treat it as

bludgeoning 20 okay so you take a wallop

from her just against the wall a

backhand with the the thing that won't

actually stop you from hitting a button

lady what I thought he turns into a log

though the whole point was to keep him

from hitting a button

because you're not technically shoving

him you can only do that as an action on

your turn

well gee but pick a you you've got two

buttons a red one and a beggin

Ross

oh sorry what oh really we'll pick red

okay a wall of irons drops down in the

doorway but nothing else happens there

was no doorway no there's the door was

cut off but in the freight built into

the frame is a dropping iron wall that

comes down so now you're double sealed

in this room gotcha

you close the blast doors you close the

blast doors that's all that happens

that's one bus action so next step is

yeah I have done nothing it's your turn

next

okay so I like I've seen tricks at this

point yes you do see strikes I'm very

confused by that but I turn my attention

back towards rest nisi how is he looking

because he took a big ol blast to the

face he's looking pretty good he's

looking kind of death though oh great

okay so conversation won't be possible

whoops all right yeah I'm just gonna

keep blasting this horn into them yeah

I'll give like another blast like that

let the force kind of hit him okay does

it push him away at all just do the

damage it just does the damage

okay washes over him go ahead and oh

he's gonna take full damage again

pretty good what'ii

okay and then roll for your horn your

solid ice and use different percentile

dice since I already used up the good

ones on that last roll 81 okay you're

good and then and I catch Strix is like

behind me how close she's like ten feet

away

okay but I'm going to use a cutting

action to disengage okay and and use

that to kinda like tumble my way back

towards first I see yeah okay so you're

gonna go like behind stricture next to

her next to her okay yeah alright you

are beside her you can see she's

clutching this disc in her hand that has

a maze carved into it as she screams at

you yeah so knock on table next to her

like gunner in one hand horn and the

other but like attention still like on

rosin easy mm-hmm all right

evylyn yeah you're up so I just swatted

him away from the console so evil ins

attention since she got here she's all

she's trying to do is figure out what

this means and find the soul monger so

did she get any any answer and he divine

inspiration does she have any

understanding of what she's looking at

no okay well thanks Lysander she knows

that the blue dial rotated when when one

boat used the the blue dial yeah he just

was clicking it back and forth right he

didn't it didn't end did it end on one

side though it's it did stop at number

two no I mean like the dial is it in a

position now no it sort of rests back to

its normal position okay

so even thinks that the blue dial

rotates clockwise so far the red button

closes the blast doors and the double

Tildy / alchemical symbol for water ish

thing turns on Wamba birthing tubes so

she does not want one but birthing tubes

she does not want to go back where the

gargoyles were so she is going to turn

she's gonna turn the blue dial okay wait

wait

yeah this is so hard uh it's on two

right now right ah that's correct

she's gonna try to turn it to one so

she's gonna turn the blue dial then past

the I passed the iron door that's

dropped down you hear the rooms revolve

okay but you can't see the room revolt

because of the iron wall well I'm trying

to turn the indicator light to one oh I

see yes that you can do okay you turn it

to one great do I see a door appear no

great do I notice anything else about

the room changing at all you do not i

push can i push another button

oh sure what would you push the blue

button was the Wando button wasn't it oh

no we didn't hit a button for them you

didn't hit a button for the wamba it

just happened

the one that just happened hmm um yeah

does the blue button open the blast

doors does it I'm gonna try the blue

button okay

when you press the blue button you hear

a sound you know like when you turn on a

PA system

there's no wrapping up that comes on and

Strix and DF you hear it - what

and paltin and miranda echoing in the

cave you hear the sound of this sort of

PA coming on break for lunch

evylyn talks you hear her voice echoing

wherever you are

yeah can I tell what direction it's

coming from no it's it's it's just

echoing up and down the cavern do I

notice the dude does it also echo into

the room like I can hear that my voice

is being projected there is a sense that

yes you can hear that it's being

projected hello everybody hears this you

hear one buzz yeah is that one yeah hey

guys I'm like even de I even does not

know that this guy's going anywhere else

she's like who asked it who knows you no

one knows and then you actually hear -

one buzz start - chitter oh sorry the

other one um hi I'm new here be quiet

I'm trying to solve the rear I'm trying

to find us so longer Shh

um we all hear this yes

DF will shout back evil and you don't

hear him dang it

can I hit a red button

have I hit too many buttons yes but all

that you hit a red yes I hit the red

button okay

oh wait that's the red button drop the

wall yeah

drop the blast doors while the iron wall

is down pushing the red button has no

effect uh I bet it's the star lever to

reset it everything well we'll have to

tune in next turn totally cause letter

levers levers by the way Birds Strix

[Applause]

well she's just gonna stare at rows DC

and then back to D I imagine even

completely oblivious of this is also

just kind of humming and puttering to

herself so you guys are just hearing

even like really hard and then also does

she is he's still covered in blood yeah

is is so is like this whole that whole

thing with the wings still there oh

you're talking about okay you do not see

wings on D F okay so she doesn't need to

panic about blue line like the like I

had like the blood on my back it was

coming from it is that that blood on my

back still there yes okay

so he's kind of covered in blood he

could have easily gotten that some other

one right so good no no questions yet

but she just likes lambs death were to

do it would like just does that that's

what she does if anybody's listening

Lysander's really good and rolls her

eyes okay Fulton and Miranda okay so we

haven't entered any kind of combat her

initiative right you are technically in

initiative Oh are we oh I'm more or less

with these new friend OHS that's right

oh okay right now you're effectively

blind you can't see them but you can

hear them and there you can feel them

kind of bumping up against your small

little boat so I can't so there's no

light I can't see them I know they're

around even if I wanted to run there's

nowhere I could go correct where there's

water on both sides so my poems also

saying this out loud it's like asides

nowhere to go

God knows what's there can't see like

okay oh well at least I don't have to

make a decision since there's only one

option I'm gonna I'm gonna very very

much like a badass take out the Sun

sword and like not just regular light

saber style but like the kylo Ren like

really aggressive like hard yeah

suddenly the room is lit up and you see

five heads of a Hydra all around you Hey

hail Hydra good day to die let's go if

you want oh absolutely

all right

what would be the bonus for this since I

rarely use it oh it has finesse that's a

thing yes you get to add your dexterity

modifier to bits

yeah it's better yes maybe the same for

you of strength or dexterity either way

yeah oh yeah well with it so it's your

dexterity bonus and your efficiency

bonus which is plus okay so that would

be viral 214 so it's plus three and your

dexterity bonus on top of that Oh

in 19 I'm sorry your +4 so 2000 20

okay so that is going to hit the Hydra

roll your damage which I have 1d8

written down that sound right well it is

just a normal long so for all intents

and purposes and it does more damage

against undead oh the weapon is also +2

to hit so you actually roll the 22 and

you get the +2 on your damage so it's 1d

8 + 2 + but your dexterity bonus cool

the 1d 8 + 6 screw it

so that is a total of 8 okay you Lance

into one of the heads and this blood and

gore starts to seep out from its neck

whoa

alright Miranda what do you do when

palton lights things up and starts

carving into the hijack do I have any

idea if dominate these two it affects

Hydra you do not believe that it is a

beast you think it is a horrible

horrible monstrosity nice very different

great I'm gonna cry a little bit I think

do if I can find it insect cloud insect

cloud alright um no am I gonna be able

to get whoo it's a 20-foot radius can I

get two heads is no matter just one you

can get all of the heads in that

excellent I'm gonna do that um well it

also can I make it thick enough that it

will be hard for them to see through the

cloud um yes you think so okay I want to

do that alright very good

okay just makan it's a con save okay

[Applause]

we lost Chris everyone's fine everyone

live you're done no Ross you cannot be

[Laughter]

home there's no no one back into the

deaf until one head comes back up and

leaves a deep oceans of sea thank you

slice his head off yeah there's not 25

wamba's okay yeah that's great 108 it

was amazing 19 okay so yes that seems

that so all these heads seem to be

attached to the same creatures it takes

the 19 points and it starts to choke and

and not like this cloud in the least and

it kind of recoils from you eat my flies

yes the Flies are going on its eyeballs

ah yes

does Simon get to shoot one oh yeah you

can shoot a dart d20 yeah cool oh well

well Simon welcome to the waffle crew

Inc

and good boy

listening but as the flies start to

gnash this creature you can see that it

is withdrawing from your boat good job

Simon you did it all right and let's see

it takes an action to row the boat so

yeah you guys are just kind of spinning

in the water right now as the as the

wake of the Hydra is pushing you away

from it and Ross we come to one by

number one one we're number one

all right so I'm gonna turn to Eevee

whatever her name is

listen okay we've known each other for a

long time we go way back

I'll help you out if we just let's

figure out this button situation

together also I died so we're just kind

of skipping over that I am assuming I'm

some sort of figment of your imagination

which I'm taking his flattery so thank

you

it was kind of staring at him with her

arms folded like he's obviously leaving

her places to like be baited or

interject but she's just like

mechanically blinking at him okay okay

cool well you're just making this

awkward so together let's let's figure

out these buttons what have you figured

out tell me what do we know what do we

know if you let me work we'll be fine

okay I mean I could help

I got thing I got button prison fingers

I don't need your help I have perfectly

good hands and yours are small and evil

well that's just that's just rude is

that another button on the other side of

the wall though I own I do a perception

check to see if I find anything else

that hasn't been seen yet and as you do

a third one but comes out finally on the

ground okay all right all the thing

six okay you do not spot anything else

except third one but who needs to roll

initiative by my dad okay

oh my god twelve okay thank you

and it is do not history um it is Roz

neesey's term res nice EE will come at

you

DF uh huh

alright his first attack is going to be

a seventeen okay set hit yeah okay not

used to hearing even and one book

bickering he does thirteen points of

slashing damage and seven points of fire

damage for a total of twenty okay you

gonna try to dodge that it wouldn't

matter okay

Oh see you down I am death warded down

to one yeah okay right there and she's

still standing there like hit me with a

second attack he will hit DF again no

okay he's gonna roll at twenty two and

that it will take you down no matter

what damage he does so he stabs you he's

bounced off by the death Ward but then

he spins around the flaming blade and

cuts you down then with his third attack

he is going to constrict strix so let's

see and I can do a reaction yes strike

SeaWorld's a fifteen on his constrict

roll that's racy it's 14 okay then he

constricts you for 10 damage alright but

can I do my hellish rebuke finally no

it's a totally in attack you can totally

do it but you haven't hit points left

yeah okay I mean I woke up in the mazes

yeah

yeah I'm okay okay so you can do your

reaction so you are grappled by it as

it's crushing you and then you have a

schrab you Kim that's right and that's

um and I can cast that as a higher level

if I really want to mmm so is a 2d ten

fire but 1d ten more for each level

above first and I would like to cast

that at a fifth level and I would like

to just scream at him and just try and

burn him so bad okay this is a major

rebuke yes whoa I how does that look

coming out of Strix his face oh it's

actually probably pretty awesome

no she's just like especially after she

sees deaath fall down she's just like

screaming I am just like fire everywhere

and like that fire before when she was

angry she's like getting all of her

anger out from being trapped in the

mazes at this snake just like all at

once so she's like on fire screaming

yeah yeah sick I would even say like

it's just like fire like coming out of

her eyes

yeah so this is what is it 5d ten yeah

okay so that's it was 2d ten 2d ten and

then at fifth level and then it gets 1d

ten for every level okay so it is five

right or is it six it's six

okay so that was nine ten to three five

seven and ten yeah 46 okay thank you yes

and it looks really awesome yes

so as the flames erupt around him is

bandages burn away even see his leprous

skin also burn away quite badly and he

has still got you in his coils that

looks very badly bloodied don't care all

right and that's essentially the end of

his turn so

yes you can try to stabilize yeah I mean

I gotta do something here big money big

money big money

oh don't don't Anna don't our 18 okay

that's one success okay yeah that's good

evylyn yes well I'm sorry I missed one

but two one but two goes between great

heights me one but two so guys I was

thinking it was nice to meet you want

the three hi that was me being the other

woman okay so anyway Scott we got a lot

of us I think what we need to do is

let's get on each other's shoulders and

just figure it out the old Goblin way

give them the old go one two three you

know how it is so I gathered my goblin

brought self clones together so don't

they just back yes

one thing battery goblins do really well

as they stack up on top of each other

like little goblin totem poles they just

hop one on top of the other also can I

just say when jumbo is around yeah can I

just say that boat behind you sick we

got some love in the chat for the boat

let's have such a cloud anyway yes

beautiful um anyway so stack we're

sacked what do we do now what's the plan

well that's up to you since that was

only basically kind of a move action for

you to rally your friends you still have

an action mmm okay action stack is not

an action I guess wow that's cool um so

we're pretty tall now where am i up to

on on TV brand or whatever so evil and

flies so she's you know she's only maybe

four feet tall but she can look taller

by virtue of her height of her over five

feet tall she's so she's not flying I

was standing at the console okay so with

you stacked up you're about six feet

tall oh look o top dog height is very

important to a goblin yeah absolutely

not just just just for reference

the middle one is the one that took the

hit and then the top one is Wamba - the

bottom one it's one by one okay so one

three - yeah okay yeah okay so we're in

a Wamba totem yeah I walk over to her

and I put my my top arm weight sorry

that's a different one but which one by

a minor I'm one bit to the top okay just

make sure it gets confusing because

we're like working is like one character

now right yes yeah okay all right so I

over I lean my I lean it lean against

there and just say you know looks like

you could use some help here with these

buttons and levers

even ones just like rolling her eyes oh

well she's also she's doing that thing

that you do when like someone touches

you that you really don't want to touch

you and you're trying to kind of like

just trying to slap him off yeah like

the drunk guy at the bar like a please

don't but one boy am i right that you're

not taking any action per se you're

happy to basically lord over your height

at the moment I Spit on her we all spill

in her oh my god I feel like I should

get like a reaction to that I said I

said that that was for hurting one but

to me wait which one's the injured one

am i the injured one I forgot what about

you I imagine these blows are actually

saying this is any real action spinner

I'm gonna give you a reaction what do

you want to do sick I punch Wamba which

one three one two one but one right in

the face the middle one just like hmm I

try to push him out of the middle of the

stack it is out looking you're just yes

to the side yes they're leaning you know

to is leaning on me and I'm just looking

at the console trying to garden trying

to think and they're like blah blah blah

I need lynZ just poop like without even

taking her attention off alright nice

it's like a plus it's just my melee

attack with your strength nice Frank's

just your strength bonus just my

strength so that's a 20 oh yeah so the

stack just sort of topples off to the

side and I go and then I go back to what

I was doing everybody by the way in the

PA here is the big screaming and

throwing fire yes all right and so

that's that's one buzz legacy would have

been fine if you hadn't spit on her okay

the Hydra dives back down into the water

to escape the insects which then leaves

palton and Myranda in their boat lit up

by the Sun sword and I just like start

pumping the rose and just go as fast as

I can that horas yes yes I just want to

get the heck out of there

so fast this boat go really fast Miranda

wants it to just bust reserves and you

make their way along and you can see

that there is a shoreline coming up on

your left Miranda as the cavern begins

to narrow and you can basically Beach

the ship and run out into it immediately

right now and you come bolting into a

room actually you come to a what appears

to be a portcullis that has dropped and

there's a hallway beyond and down that

hallway you can hear sounds of Strix

screaming okay that sounds right you're

gonna grab it do you have to mention

door yeah yep yep yep yep

okay how so

the the boat has been beached how much

how like wide is this Beach area ten

feet ten feet yeah okay

would I be able to use the ring of

winter to like freeze a good amount of

water near us

oh sure that would be your action yes

okay cool I'm gonna do that I'm just be

like just in case it wants to try and

hang you basically cone of cold the

water and it just sort of ices over all

around the boat very satisfying cool

yeah all right then Miranda start

shaking you and shouting about dimension

book yep yep I got it good waters that

you should learn to fly it's really

useful one by one you're up you're lying

in a pile with two other wamba's one by

three smelly foot is sticking in your

face oh my god you're muted Roz so I do

this like Three Stooges thing like get

off me you bozos and I stand up you know

just I just myself off I just like

brewed your leg you are rude you're

still is mean and cranky and rusty and

rude as you've ever been

you guys take rusty rusty you heard me

excuse me

rusty old robot are you taking any

actions or just scolding her

are there any rocks in the room no okay

I pick up the other one but I throw the

one but the one police helmets injured

the one that has the least health okay

yes you pick up the injured Wamba and

throw it at its an improvised weapon so

just make a d20 argue that being thrown

at evylyn would hurt the woman more than

it would hurt evylyn probably yes evil

um but just sort of bounces off of a

balloons armor

splashes down onto the floor in front of

her look what you did chill out that's

crying all right oh yeah

praise Allah fan very busy did you CH

are you telling that to the little one

yeah that one that just got thrown at

you yeah is he crying crying it made her

sad oh okay all right

and she looks mean meanly at one but one

and point to him and said look what you

did you should be ashamed of yourself

okay and then don't woman that just fell

on the ground cries and like puts his

arm around like it's like arms around

your leg like like it's a little toddler

she Pat's it while she's still

considering the console okay and well

and while you are considering the

console wumba let's see one but three is

still in the pile right one by three in

the pile can see sort of peeking out at

the top of Evelyn's backpack that black

egg no I secured it I know you did

all right and this is not his turn no it

is ra's niecy's Rosnay see is still

constricting u s-- tricks you are going

to take I'm very mad still you're gonna

take ten points of damage as you were

crushed okay and then he's going to bite

you okay

and he's naked advantage so he rose at

twenty five that's gonna hit and he's

gonna do five piercing damage plus seven

poison damage 412 that's it

all right so you go limp in his coils

and then it is DS turn you've got

another dead safe

yeah hmm you skip my turn

nice trick that's with the save save us

you skip number five too

strict's you get to go first bless you

I'd like to first misty step away good

all right yeah I would like to get as

far away as I can read con man I would

like to firebomb to out of him okay

go ahead and drop your fireball and I

believe that I don't have enough sorcery

points because I did that for the

seventh level hellish rebukes there just

has to be regular fireball very good so

all right so 24 Wow okay he takes it all

yeah she's just like okay and you reduce

him to a blackened snakey skeleton his

sword clatters to the ground and goes

out is he dead he appears to be crispy

dead she's like she's gonna run straight

to D F and just be like please wake up

please wake up please she's just like

shaky and she'll cast um I have the

thing the the thing for keeping keeping

on dead people non dead the cleric spell

everything there's good action welcome

what kind of what kind of action is it I

don't know it's probably action yeah you

can okay so you're making him alright oh

I was gonna say you can't you can't miss

these stuff is bonus action and cast the

spell higher than first level but

doesn't matter if you can detonate the

fireball even if you were in his coil so

yes he is mighty dead you are in his

coils and you just sort of blow him away

yeah

you to ashes and burnt skulls and bones

yeah and they just sort of clatter

around the room and then we come

- one of the Wombles Oh Oh which one

the 100 on the leg whatever the 1i

biggest one it's very important to keep

okay all right you know what I agree I

agree

is one okay so no leg wa was no like leg

Wamba was the one that is that you're

comforting was the one you punched which

is to cuz the second one tried to get up

on the console and you punched that one

right I thought too was on top and she

punched the middle one which was one too

look the matter of the fact one but does

it is really the game is my specialty

and it's working great okay so I am the

one bud that is on her leg sure and I'm

just gonna be like look up and go they

were mean of me she's just absent

mindedly patting his head like yes Shh I

yes pray to pray till Evander for

comfort she's looking at the console

just trying to focus and then that one

but does he turns and he he he prays

crazy still endure and the other one was

just screaming and Golan what do you do

when the praying of the gobbling fills

your heart she she was like this was the

most absent-minded evangelism she's ever

done and it worked

[Laughter]

this gets our attention and she kneels

down

bless this your newest newest child is

me what the hell is happening over there

even the lowest of us are blessed by

your Holy Light wait Lois that's mean

and I make a perception

[Laughter]

[Music]

okay what would you like to do anything

else are you done

is this my turn still yeah um no sister

oh my oh um no just keep keep referring

to that life and our you know how it is

baby all right now it's your turn evil

laugh and are the the prayer that I did

with him I'm assuming was a free action

cuz it's basically talking okay so she

she finishes the prayer and she kind of

like squeezes him and she says walk

steadily on the path to the light now go

proselytize to your brothers and I'm

gonna get back to the console

shoes them off back toward the other one

buzz and no he's like more all right

sorry okay I pull I take a deep breath

and I pull the star lever alright

the floor falls away and you and all

three wamba's go tumbling down into

darkness all right and you see as you

pull the lever it rips out of the

console and you're still holding it when

you fall and it's like this little

golden wand shining in your hand as you

fall down into the blackness and then

suddenly evylyn lands in the room with

Strix yeah like she just fell through

the ceiling

I'm here to know there are no Lisa found

Christ before it lands like just just

holding this star and looking around and

there's like bits of ad black ash sort

of settling around the room after the

fireball just went off and everything

smells pretty funky and then a few

seconds later coming through

a secret door in one wall is Miranda and

paltin oh cool with a very unconscious

death on the floor yeah it's just like

like holding him up and just like

hugging yes you can absolutely even I'm

kind of in shock because I thought

everyone was dead

yeah thought that one Bob was all that

dark that was a pretty big twist about

Miranda how much healing do you I guess

how much healing you want to dish out

I'm gonna do it at that first level okay

eight eight are you I also madness

straits is also like a little bit on

fire a little weight yeah

ten okay ten yeah if you are conscious

with ten hit points Miranda as you pick

yourself up from healing DF you look

over on the altar and you see your dead

adventuring companion um I want to pick

up the sword by the way I want Rosie's

card and then I'm going to grab a sword

and then your then your then your you

know your you look over at the sword and

you yes you see her bled out corpse and

then you look back at the sword and

realize she didn't die for nothing

okay they're all gone sir all of my

friends

[Music]

she's gonna sort of collect the body and

hug it and then sort of lay it down

awkwardly and go okay I don't have

anything else to look for in here uh my

friends are good let's kill this so

longer thing is it a thing I don't

really know let's let's destroy it it it

killed all of my friends evylyn has

slowly like quietly walked over and is

like this close to Strix

it's looking at her really like intently

like studying her as though evylyn can't

be seen because she's still holding

together she thinks is unconscious by

the way it's just like why even even

ones like you are you are dead are you

am i it was a dream there was a it was

barmy there was a maze oh there was I

found out some really bad things she

looks down and like drops D as you

look really bad

evylyn just as soon as this kind of

comes clear that this actually is tricks

cuz when she hears her scream like that

she knows the districts she just like

grabs her in a big hug and grabs TF up

and she's just trying to grab as many of

them as she can and just like hug all of

them including Miranda she's like are

you an angel person

thud Chris I do you want to point out

that we are over I know I know okay uh

DF being cautious at this point and

Strix screams that I guess

oh she's yeah she's she starts like

mouthing off about all these things that

she learned you know universes get in

and I don't know what's happening any
