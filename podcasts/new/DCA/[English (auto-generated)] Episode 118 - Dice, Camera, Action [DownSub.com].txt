hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action it means it may seem like we are

Hollie list today but in fact Hollie

will hopefully be joining us shortly

she's she's taking a pigeon air flight

back to Seattle and it's running a

little bit late so previously indice

camera action our adventurers cornered

father Luke Sun bright in his office in

the spires of the morning the temple of

Lysander in water deep and thereupon as

he imbibed some of his wine the priests

keeled over dead and burst into flames

fearing that deaath would be pinned for

the crime the waffle crew made some

hasty attempts to gather their wits

ultimately however death was taken into

custody and brought to trial

swiftly water deep justice is Swift

justice but he was not found guilty of

the crime of murdering the priest

instead he was found guilty of the crime

of stealing a bottle of wine a crime

which he did not commit but which he

basically fessed up to to cover for his

good friend paltin who with evylyn tried

to intercede on Dee's behalf at the

trial to no avail Strix tried as well

going as far as to barge into the black

staffs Tower to try to convince the

black staff to take a step in D s

direction the black staff instead went

to omen drawn who did nothing least he's

consistent yes so when we last left

paltin he was getting drunk at a bar

when we last left

evylyn she was at home at the Waffle

House basically languishing while the

kids and waffles

and others were gallivanting around

oblivious to deaths predicament Strix

went off in rat form to try to

infiltrate castle water deep slipped

down into the dungeons and hook up with

DF who is now trapped in a dark cell

having received a visit from a dark

stranger forget anything that sounds

like everything alright

oh and also the very successful launch

of SEPA and SEPA there's no such thing

no such thing

it's a pet Palo palton with a law

practice is an entirely different show

that's better call Paul making covens

yes coven absolutely absolutely

oh ha a la Kevin evylyn you can see that

things are in a bit of disarray you

haven't had any visitors to the bakery

so it's just the kids running around and

doing their thing as you kind of look

longingly out a dirty window toward the

front of the waffle crew you see two

horses come into view both bedecked in

beautiful not Armour but basically they

just got sort of these draped I don't

even know what they're called can't

remember what they're called Flags

almost mm-hmm with the symbol of

Lysander displayed prominently on them

you can see also one of the horse riders

is a young man holding a banner with the

golden symbol of Lysander at the top on

the other horse dismounting is a cloaked

figure

and what you can make of her is that she

has dark charcoal skin and white hair

shaved almost down to the scalp

evylyn is like she sees this I assume

out a window yeah and she's like oh like

the way like a kid seeing like the

ice-cream man yeah or like a parade or

something like that she's like oh you

mean you just runs out she doesn't even

know whether they're stopping to see her

or anything but she just does that thing

like you would like mine ice cream man's

coming and you just run out okay so you

trip over some toys and stuff on your

hair you fly over some toys and stuff on

your way to the door you realize that

the the place behind you is in somewhat

disarray the bakery is a little out of

sorts at this moment but you're kind of

you know I mean yeah he's not thinking

about whether or not they're coming in

she's like horses are like when

someone's obsessed with like sport cars

and like loves to talk about the nuts is

about horses absolutely like horses she

comes from a horse town cool-looking

lady riding the horse and like let the

under livery all over the place

she's not really thinking about the

house she'll just shut the door behind

her yeah run out to the curb like oh

when you run out you can see that the

woman hands the reins of her horse to

the other rider who stays mounted on his

and then she begins making her way

toward you and you can see right away

that there is something unusual about

her well first of all she's a drow

second of all her eyes are sort of milky

white they don't seem to have any pupils

do they look like Strix is somewhat yes

make an insight check

well 10 okay the way she carries herself

suggests someone of great bearing and

import do I think that this might be the

person that sister in in Cynthia told me

about yeah it seems highly unlikely that

you would just run into another drought

here in the city it must be to last in

ad Aragon who's who's also wearing low

pay under clothing and yeah and all that

exactly yes she's got her her actual

she's just wearing traveling gear not

nothing particularly fancy it's almost a

pedestrian but she does have the symbol

of with ander around her neck what would

be the appropriate like etiquette

greeting for someone of her station for

a paladin you could simply refer to her

as priestess or priest

oh I see what you're saying so yes you

would if she is if she's the person you

think she is her station is higher than

yours in the clergy so if not bow at the

very least just sort of a nod of the

head so I think even like sees that

she's approaching and she's like like

smoothing her like clothes and like kind

of trying to arrange her hair kind of

like very excited alright she comes over

to you and

her gaze doesn't shift off of the

building ahead of you but she speaks to

you and says I am looking for evil in my

vein she even like tries to get in her

gaze like hi I'm Eva Mar same very

pleased to meet you priestess

I'm so honored assuming your to last

Thea and Aragon is that right Palestine

elastin to last him till Aston yeah

that's a hard name Chris it sure is -

less than a Darragh on the priestess of

what banner she says a pleasure to meet

you my name is tal Aston and Aragon

can we go inside hmm how about yes just

would you excuse me one moment

of course even like like very calmly

walks in the door then shuts it behind

her and he was like mom's gonna be home

at five minutes

piling toys into a pile and shoving them

in a closet and like signing - not

frantically like clean up that and like

yelling at squiggly like stop licking

that picking up you know just like

frantically trying to clean up at least

like the common space day one Celestin

sorta you see her kind of peering

through or not peering through a window

just sort of standing on the porch out

front kind of staying in the shade and

kind of out of sight but you can see

that there are other people in troll

skali who have sort of stopped because

the horses are so majestic in their

display is so majestic and they don't

see a drow on your doorstep every day so

I think even just kind of like and like

the door again while she's like kicking

another toy out of the way and yes

please

the end and she comes in and she sort of

makes her way into the room you see

despite the fact that despite her

disability she seems to move around

tables and chairs as if she knows where

they are

mm I'm very pleased to meet you I am so

surprised that you have presumably just

arrived in town and you've come to visit

hear me now I'm sure you for you she

holds up a couple fingers and just says

and she sort of turns her head toward

the display of pies and pastries it kind

of makes her way over there a little bit

and says to you as she walks over there

to inspect the wares I have already been

to the temple and I'm aware of a

situation there ah the situation there's

a few situations that I could think of

but I'm wondering exactly which

situation you might be talking about the

death of father son bite yeah that was

one of her scenes maybe you were talking

about it I have spoken to sister incense

yeah she's told me about your and your

friends roles in the recent events there

which were just that we happened to be

there not that we had anything to do

with the death just to be clear wouldn't

want to get off on the wrong foot if you

ask different people they say different

things but I I believe you and she sort

of leans in and you see her taken the

smell of the pastries may I offer you

some pie or baked goods of any kind even

one realizes she doesn't know the name

of any of the things she says it is all

very suspicious of course not you I mean

regarding me arriving as I did now after

father's and brights death you see

father son bright died from Sun death

poison and this was mere days before his

drow adversary arrived in the city

hmm Betty I mean I never would have

thought of that as suspicious but anyway

I am responsible oh well are are you we

believe the real murderer is trying to

discredit us both Father Son bright and

I well that makes sense to me you seem

very nice

what do you know about father Honda uh

doesn't even even know of him cuz she's

never met him

I guess she would have known what DF

told her yeah uh I only know that he

seems very unfriendly and suspicious he

claims to be a descendant of the great

adventurer Explorer Randall morn whose

lineage is said to have died out years

ago

so doesn't you gonna know that adventure

and make a history check man I just got

these new Dyson they're not good so far

eight nope

he says but she says almost registering

your lack of awareness of who this is

she says he is a very present figure in

the d√°il lands near to where I came from

and on many occasions even fought my

people hmm well what would that mean if

he was a descendant

well first we should establish whether

he is or not know a man who a lie about

who he is will lie about almost

everything yeah I suppose that's true

perhaps while I'm settling in you and

your friends could investigate the

matter surely there are records

somewhere in this city I'm not as

familiar with all that Waterdeep has to

offer

yeah I love records I know exactly where

I could find records I assume there's

like a library where even used to go to

study yeah absolutely

she loves books so she's probably very

excited about this mm-hmm

and I think she takes out like a little

piece of paper and a pencil and she's

like what exactly could I look up for

you his lineage and where he came from I

assumed maybe some information about

what was his name the adventurer Morin

Randall lon Randall yeah okay um and she

just writes all this down and she's like

I would I would be honored your

priestess Ness to help you with that

is there anything else we could do for

you she says according to sister incense

you you raised some funds to preserve

the orphanage and I'm grateful for that

you also expressed to her your wish to

see father son brights brought back from

the dead

well of course I will take care of that

thank you that would just really be a

load off my mind thank you and then

father son bride can return to a small

little temple in dagger fruit and I can

take over the spires of the morning as

priestess arrest intended yeah I think

that'll make him pretty upset but maybe

it's for the best

it is quite likely that his followers

his most ardent ones anyway terrified to

support him now but he has fallen when

he returns he will be seen as weak

particularly if it is I who bring him

back from the dead hmm do you know

anything about why he was on this this

I'm an artwork hick and why he wanted to

change everything at the temple the

heresy of the three faiths son is always

with us it is part of our faith some

believe it to be imminent this return I

believe otherwise you may not know much

about me but I was not always a follower

of lavender I was in league with some of

the worst people you can imagine and it

wasn't until I came to the surface and

saw the Sun that I was struck in all by

its beauty

that's a real pretty story the Thunder

said he would redeem me the price being

my site was it worth it absolutely I

thought so I think I'll take this one

oh let me wrap that up for you even

fines like some you know parchment or

something and makes a pretty little

package and puts a little bow on it she

makes it very nice and then gives the

tour and please enjoy it anytime please

come visit if you need just a break from

temple life I know can be crazy over

there and you know I love making friends

if we could be friends we don't have to

be friends I mean if you wanted he turns

to you and takes the little bag that you

you put it in and she says in the days

ahead it will be most how do you say it

would be good to know that that we can

work together to make a struggle temple

of offender here in the city I will be

judged for what I am more than who I am

and your support would be would take us

a long way toward ensuring that the

temple remains a peaceful place I know

what it's like to be judged for you

for who you are and if there's anything

I can do I will do it

am i uh am i I'm at the house right you

sort of walk in the door right now okay

pause and look who's here

it's priestess tang and I wish I could

actually remove that name and Aragon so

last name is ID Aragon and Aragon yeah

okay and she loves Lysander and I love

Lysander and Xander's the greatest and

her friends now and I gave her a pastry

and she said she might come by sometime

maybe and uh this is Paulson Croesus

falls in bow hello there's an awkward

silence

I was like well okay then he like as he

what like when he walked through the

door he was uh just like holding a lute

leg over and then he just like goes into

the the pastries and just like grabs a

pie and there's like alright see you

later and then just like starts walking

out he's also wearing his uh his nice

purple coat from party yeah where are

you going

oh I've been I've been out playing kind

of you've been playing yeah kind of

there's that fee to pay even after DF

serves the time so I figured go out and

make money like to try and do that which

I totally didn't get from fanart but

that's what you're wondering even looks

at ID that priestess whose name is a

black hole like mind and oh he's a

musician have you ever heard him play

he's quite amazing and maybe oh would

you want to go to his show together if

you need to relax maybe just you know in

your off time we could go and um he's

are you still on the drunken dying tour

I mean not that to her we need a new

ones the sunshiney tour he's on the

sunshiny tour oh this is uh this is for

a charity it's called it's called cepa's

Wish Foundation because my wish is that

did not be in jail businessman

jack-of-all-trades

like just trying to diversify that

portfolio man so anyway precess

priestess of aragon turns to you and

says sort of ignoring Paulding turns to

you and says I'm going to reserve the

temple and make preparations for the

Resurrection ritual thank you for the

pastry it was a pleasure to see you here

it was my pleasure please come by

anytime and I'll come visit the temple

soon and you let me know if there's not

anything at all I can do

of course paltin you see this blinded

woman with a short buzzcut walk past you

doesn't even technology Schiele isn't

like she seemed nice even's like cool

she's so nice if she likes what the

Android she did someone it was crazy I'm

an author stuff and she's gonna bring

father son right back to life and then

none of this will be a problem anymore

and then uh you know it'll be great

what what

wasn't she cool did you see her hair can

we like back up a little bit you said

bring Sun bright back to life why

because he was murdered

well he was also kind of a dick well I

mean you're kind of a dick but I'm still

like you on the town surprise to you is

it you know just because just cuz it's

true doesn't mean it doesn't hurt I'm

sorry I didn't mean to hurt your

feelings I've just been kind of on edge

lately and you know father-son bat

raised me and I didn't that's very nice

of him and he did a great job but I

don't know about that but he did well

either way whatever he was then I'm

assuming it's different than what he I'd

say is now was now evil and Paul's

talking but the horses outside are

making noises

okay cool I'm gonna go I'm all be out

performing you know do you need me to

come help with like promoting and like

managing the lists and stuff like we did

on your last door yeah sure why not

we need money so oh uh maybe I'll go

make sure waffles can babysit she goes

an ass waffles to falafels can babysit

and Simon and squidly

No solutely I've told you a million

times you can't babysit that's going to

leave like licking a jar he's like why

you are being babysat Simon & Waffles

you listen to what they say no shooting

them oh yeah speaking of which I found

this she takes out the gun she doesn't

know what a gun I don't know just put it

back where you found it sounds like oh

good job finding I'll meet you out in

town told them just dips everyone goes

with him okay so the two of you leave

the house - an owl bear and a wooden

puppet and you know as we do as you do

yeah you just dispense with whole idea

of babysitters that there's been real

babysitters at this point if they go out

when the horses are still at the end of

the street evylyn does that thing where

she's like describing the cool things

about the horses that no one except

horse people would understand she's like

oh did you see this and this and did you

see how they their gait was like this

and their liver it was like this and

she's just like pointing out all that

stuff - Paulson who I assume does not

care at all yeah you would have you

would have all this information evil and

partly because you come from AM fail and

AM fail the town north of Waterdeep is

like a horse heaven its horses are

raised there there's ranches all over

the place so yeah it's like uh-huh yes

babe those are horses very good where

are you guys going after leaving the

Waffle House my soup Alton steering this

wagon yeah

probably where I think there would be to

the best of my knowledge a good

combination of lots of people but also

with money the spring market spring

market it is all right are you just

gonna set up somewhere yet I mean it's

gonna be like playing and putting out a

hat thing okay looks like busking more

than it's like a show I mean

performances are pretty sick so it'll

become a show

okay yeah even like as soon as he picks

a spot it's walking around the like

courtyard or wherever they're at letting

people know that the show's gonna start

in ten minutes and it's gonna be one of

the finest ever seen and you should make

sure that you tell all your friends and

be sure to stay here in the courtyard

because the paltin SEPA is about to play

I'm sure you've heard of them cue like

walks by and whiskers like make sure you

mention SEPA and step below and also the

cepa's Wish Foundation if the show is to

benefit the cepa's Wish Foundation and

is sponsored by SEPA and septa at law

wait what very good yes and so make a

charisma performance check and Evelyn

make a charisma persuasion check these

guys suck not the guys 2940

okay well the performance more than

makes up for just anything else I mean

29 GS okay you're you're the best show

in the city right now okay particularly

when you break out your third hand and

start playing with like the extra ham

bill like it's it's hand rue but like to

make it less creepy just like I threw a

glove on him so he's enjoying so they're

like Lulu it's a cool trick yeah exactly

all right so Paul Tain's music regales

crowds as they meander through the

crowded Spring Market providing them

with much welcomed entertainment and

relief from the hustle and bustle and

pretty soon evil and you find yourself

just sort of crowded out by just a large

crowd of people who are completely

entranced by this stellar performer I'm

crowded like I like end up in the back

kinda yeah you're sort of pushed off

just by the the sheer volume of people

that he's attracted evil ins like trying

to get his attention like I up because

she was like getting like pushed back

and she's like are you and I assume that

he doesn't even notice performing so she

she starts kind of like

pouting in the back all right and paltin

you see a few innkeepers and tavern

keepers who are moving among the crowd

will like throw little wooden cards into

your hat so to speak

basically contact information as if you

know if you're looking for jobs at their

places or putting on shows at their

places and and they try to entreat you

to make time to speak to them at some

point in your busy future cool will do

while this is going on Strix welcome

Holly hello I'm sorry all my I just got

home from a trip and all my animals I'm

making every noise that they do that's

fine that's totally fine you are in rat

form yeah hey skulking up the side of

Mount water deep to get to a castle

perched on its eastern spur under which

you think death has been incarcerated

cool this sounds like I'm being dumb

well you get up to the castle and you

realize oh my god this is an actual real

castle it's like yeah it is a it is a

mighty fortification with sturdy walls

and and whatnot now being a rat

you could try to maybe crawl up a wall

climb in through a narrow slit and kind

of make your way down from there or your

other option is to maybe look for

something at ground level well I could

probably have a pretty good sense of

smell right yeah so I could probably

like smell where they took him maybe not

that great sense of smell but you could

certainly smell like for instance if

there was a like a pipe or a culvert or

something with water coming out or

something like that you could probably

pick up on that pretty quick sense of

kitchens or whatever but make a just

make a perception check for me okay they

left all my dice downstairs so we get

the dice roller hold on okay this is

where I am right now okay

back to you oh wait now I got it I got

it as clicking okay sixteen okay

sorry feathers is just the worst pitch

that's only go so you find you can

either like I said you can either try to

climb up a wall and go in over the wall

or through a narrow slit or you did find

what appears to be a pipe that's big

enough around that could fit three of

you if you really wanted to and there's

some there's some fluid water spilling

out of it okay um that's gross but I

guess I'll go in you start to pad your

way up through the water to this pipe

yeah like get to the pipe I like look at

my witch hat and like I'm like take it

off okay it's right one too many feet

like one too many times which hat it

goes poof one at this when you take it

off and then you head up you follow this

pipe all the way to its end and you can

you know that you're heading to a

kitchen long before you get there

because you the smells coming to you and

this kitchen must be fairly deep within

the castle you can see it's got a low

ceiling braced by thick stone arches

there is a hearth their staff bustling

around the place is full of clutter and

whatnot and they seem to be making meals

not nothing fancy doesn't smell like

anything fancy all right well I'm

concerned that it's a kitchen

considering that I'm a rat in a kitchen

so I'm going to do my best to not be

seen okay and just get out of the

kitchen as quickly as possible

Oh question yeah horray I turn into a

rat I was holding up high does that mean

it's now part of my rat yes good you

thought you sort of absorb your gear

into its new exactly okay yes please

with advantage because you're tiny oh

thank god thirteen and okay

first one was one okay nobody seems to

be paying much attention to you you can

skull

through the kitchen through a pantry out

into a hall along a hall where you see a

guard just standing in front of a door

and then a staircase leading up and down

a spiral staircase I'm guessing he's

gonna be down so I'm gonna try and go

down okay as you attempted to navigate

the castle I'm not gonna go room by room

hallway by hallway just make a survival

check to sort of keep your bearings okay

so I'm proficient in survival oh great

so that's 19 great you you do feel like

you're making your way down along what

you believed to be a path to the dungeon

and you were rewarded when you were

proven correct okay yeah but it just

comes out as like squeak yep and you can

see it's it's dreary down here there are

lamps oil lamps that illuminate at

regular intervals they're sort of lamp

smoke oily smoke air stench about the

place as well as the smell of sweat and

whatnot you can see cell doors cell

blocks there are hundreds of cells down

here ah alright and as you try to follow

your nose to pinpoint where death is it

leads you deeper and deeper and deeper

into this compound and you actually pass

by a couple guards on the way okay who

don't the guards out here you don't get

the impression that they really care

about rats too much all right that's

cool that's good that makes me feel less

afraid I'll just continue trying to find

him death you're out in the Sun this is

your your one hour a day out in the

courtyard of Castle Waterdeep and you're

just letting the Sun come down over the

walls upon you

you see tall spires this is like a

almost like a fairy tale castle in a lot

of ways but sort of a a dark grey color

hardly romantic but at the top of the

various spires you see long banners and

flags catching the spring breeze and you

smell the air the salt

the salty maritime air and there are

there are other prisoners out here but

there was kind of separated from you

yeah I can't dimension when interacting

with them very much no and there are

guards watching from all the walls above

you and you can actually see crossbows

their pointy tips peering out through

arrow slits yeah during the hour I

really don't think yes does so a whole

lot aside from sit there and just enjoy

his brief time outside the air the Sun

while also getting a nostalgic feeling

that he hates Strix you find DSL but you

can't get in it how come cuz it's sealed

up tight

what cuz it's a cell yeah but like

there's like book no cartoon bars I

don't know nope it is it it is an iron

door set into a stone frame and it's

flush there's like there's like two

steps leading down to the iron door and

then it's pretty much flush with the

stone well if he and he's not in there

you can smell him okay um alright well

I'll just turn back into myself and just

like like hey are you in there you're

sort of crouched in the alcove of the

door just whispering under that door

yeah and if I if I don't get a response

I'll just turn into a cloud and I'll go

through whatever hole I could find okay

as a cloud you can make your way through

the door into a dark cell that is at

present empty although you see some kind

of untouched food on a plate on a small

little stool

okay well I'm unhappy that it's

untouched so I note that and I'm like

mm-hmm

but I'll just hang out in there is a

cloud and just wait I guess kind of like

towards the ceiling so that no one sees

me obviously

okay at the end of your our death

you are escorted back to your cell and

locked inside its tricks you see the

guards to deliver him in and close the

door behind them and seal him inside

this dark chamber you can't imagine how

he feels in that moment I mean he didn't

eat his food so clearly not well as soon

as des is like put back inside he

basically just really dropped down to

his knees and then his hands and just

crawls back to the corner that's just

heartbreaking so strikes is just going

to like float down and just not

immediately like turn back into herself

but kind of like just wave as a cloud

maybe and see if she she just want to

scare him as the whole she's like he's

already acting very scared he's probably

like face down or like in his hands or

something look around or see anything

all right um by the way does the pie

still continue with me as a cloud yeah

it's still absorbed here whatever for me

right now okay these are all if these

are important yeah so she'll just I

guess she'll just turn back into herself

and just kind of like not say anything

but just sort of set a set the pie like

in front of him just not to scare him

okay yeah if you become instantly aware

that Strix is present because that pie

is a familiar owner you know even though

you can't see in the dark

yeah that's shocking I need me to shock

you yeah I guess do you think the dark

is just like tricks what are you doing

here it's fine I was a cloud and but you

shouldn't have to be tortured like this

no you can't be here right now if they

can't find you you have to go get out of

here it's fine no it's not strict you

have to go

it's the stop Shh making scared noises

is gonna get more people's attention

brought you a pie please eat it and

don't starve she just she just doesn't

say anything and just sits down next to

him it just gives him a hug and she's

like I'm not gonna leave you here this

is terrible and it's not your fault it

was Paulson's fault

it's no one's fault it's okay I'll be

okay just know you can't stay in here if

they catch you they'll throw you and

what to you crease tricks leave I'm not

going to leave yet

it's like chill just fine if you don't

want me to leave

I'll find a better solution she's turns

back into a rat and just like sits on

his knee and crosses a little rat it has

a hat on again yeah EF just doesn't let

up and just continue to say just please

you'll be safer

you'll go I'll feel better if you're

just safe she's just she just shakes her

hand gestures towards the pie like she's

not gonna leave until like he eats

something she's like with her right

hands

so when Wendy Rosen is Sal did I take

all his stuff yeah they would have they

would have taken anything that would

have potentially been a danger to

himself okay so what they probably

wouldn't take is something that clearly

has no intrinsic value and clearly has

or seems to have no dangerous edge to it

like you might have your little necklace

okay you would not have your keys right

I guess seeing little pouty restricts

gifts will kind of reach out to the pie

and for the first time first time he

actually just eats the pie Oh

[Laughter]

yeah yeah shall distil this like rat on

his shoulder and just kind of likes like

like sit there and just like make sure

he eats a little bit yeah which he does

and maybe after like lingering moments

because he doesn't actually want to be

alone but just knows him safer for her

to not be there he'll just again tell

her that you know he couldn't live with

himself if she gets caught too and she

had cheese to go

yeah she'll she doesn't want to torture

him obviously because she knows he's

really worried but she's gonna nod her

little rat head but before she goes

she'll turn back into herself again and

take up a pie pan okay oh that she

absorbs it again and she pulls the

feather out of her hair and hands it to

him and says you're not alone you'll

never be alone and then she turns into a

clown

do you just feel now that the one which

he takes her I assume she had some sort

of light a candle or something that you

could see it actually have a

face-to-face conversation nothing too

bright of course probably your land well

like maybe her lantern dim dim dimmed

really low after she after she leaves

you're back in the dark again you still

have that feather to sort of feel yeah

and he'll take the feather and keep it

on his person or okay stop it you know

like a shirt or something so that it

isn't seen and then she just leaves as a

cloud she's like why didn't I do this

the first time like why do I go as a rat

whatever so are you trying to be like a

creepy misty cloud on the ground kind of

deal II uh yeah I think I'll just creepy

misty cloud on the ground and just kind

of like find as many cracks as I can and

just like just like ooze out of the

building okay

evylyn as you're sort of standing behind

the crowd you a voice says wow he's he's

actually pretty good

and I know he's the best wait hi hello

it's Todd

you you can see that he's there he's got

some there are some other guards and

they're just kind of very casually just

keeping an eye on things in the market

as they do but he saw the crowd

gathering came over and said you know

saw you here and thought he should just

say hi that's odd how are you pretty

good

looks like your friends gonna be busy

for I'll run it just grabbed a bite to

eat over at a stall do I see this make a

perception check even has been like

having Felton and he hasn't been paying

any attention as soon as Todd shows 22

yes so as you're playing you can see

through the thicket of the curt of the

people crowd off to one off on one

corner Todd and his stupid shiny armor

has come up and is talking to evylyn in

his stupid voice it was like as soon as

he asked her like do you want to grab a

bite to eat she's kind of like well I

was I was watching the show and you can

see her like believing okay so as if I

can as I'm performing I'm gonna cast

vicious mockery just like really really

low end and just just sending stuff it's

like she's not into you dude never seen

anyone get friend-zoned harder just just

walk away now man walk away with your

dignity is your to do damage with this

spell I prefer not to be like one okay

just a little just just a little like

emotional sting okay that's not terribly

vicious mockery mm-hmm it's more it's

more like somewhat hostile okay so he's

got to make a saving throw mm-hmm

so what's your save DC 17 okay okay so

for an instant evil and you see Todd

looks sort of momentarily distracted

he's like trying to figure out like

there's some and he seems hurt

crestfallen all of a sudden this

translates to even as him being hurt

that she didn't agree to go grab a bite

with him

right away oh no I didn't mean that I

didn't want you yeah but yeah I have

time for a bye he won't be done as I set

for a little while and yeah let's I'm

sorry I didn't mean to be rude I

that's the end of the first day all

right

so pulp you just stop pack everything up

throw everything in a bag and then start

to march through the crowd people are

clapping thank you thank you thank you

and and they want us like shake your

hand and there's like padding on the

show and then you find yourself just

sort of mobbed

comfortingly like yes there's there's a

group of young boys and girls who are

just screaming thank you thank you

hugging on your cloak and like excuse me

you sort of draw Todd over toward the

stall that he was pointing at where

oh yeah

[Laughter]

hill-hill Todd will sort of back away

and he kind of stumbles a bit like I

catch it but catches his feet kind of

does a little spin around gives you a

smile

evylyn and then sort of gets back on his

balance and walks over to his friends

isn't he nice falton you don't trust him

you should hire them for security on the

next leg of your tour yeah we we I don't

know I feel like we're more than capable

of our own security I don't know

you're like cloaks ripped again

no it's not okay you didn't get mobbed

again no it's fine it's it's it's it's

an easy fix

okay well great I mean you're right I am

pretty capable of security I mean like

if you want me to do security I can do

that or you know promotion or anything

yeah yeah for sure for sure definitely

always always always a big help so uh

what did have we have we done how much

have we raised for uh I just I just I

just rolled that so in mixed coinage

coppers are nibs shards dragons you

netted a total of 21 gold pieces which

is actually pretty astonishing 21 gold

all right and uh well how much was that

fee again 500 ah yes

500 okay so now on your way right it's

only like boy and how long do we have

it's a ten day he's in prison for a ten

day right okay so so with that

performance and we need okay so oh my

god this is going to take a lot of we

need to make a bigger show yeah they've

never been in Waterdeep we need facts we

need we need opening acts we um we need

wizards to make like cool lights and

stuff mmm that does sound good

do we know anyone that knows magic

strikes hello that's that's that's what

I was getting at yeah at great idea

Strix striction they are lighting

designer right oh yeah it's good okay so

we got our T arrow technics God yeah yep

she's she's she's definitely somewhere

obses

she is very she's very crucial to the to

the show not not our show like our

existence as a show the show we're

talking about like performing even

though this all is a show

um so she's definitely alive well this

has happened somebody comes up asked for

faultless autograph he just sort of

absolutely saw those oh right that is

100 gold maybe that much but guess what

guess what I was thinking I I know who

could help us make the biggest show ever

in water deep yes whoo Oh men

oh and Ron he would help us and he knows

everybody and he has like this big

business and everything I'm sure he has

a venue we could use he'd probably let

us use it for free we really just got to

figure out who else could help us with

this show like it's just beyond me I

don't man but we could find some people

or I'm sure if we put out like flyers or

like there's probably like a billboard

or like a community board or something

Holly are Strix have you received any

missives of late Oh from from omen yes

no he hasn't written back since evylyn

wrote him that note about palton and her

being invited to his mom's barn yeah

yeah I feel like I feel like he's tired

of our

so you what you escaped from the castle

Strix in gaseous form and then where do

you go I'll just just go back down to

the street and take a normal route home

okay great yeah probably just on my

broom as I normal I probably have a

route that I take like just around the

city like on my broom was way be like

hello when you get home the kids are

just out of control and you can see that

they tell you some people came by but

the kids weren't sure the bakery was

actually open so they kind of scared him

off okay am i good job you keep scaring

everyone unless I tell you not to scare

them and she'll just start getting the

house in order making sure waffles with

idli it's literally a man certainly may

have pretended that one of them was a

Hobgoblin and actually shot him

well Facebook based on the story your

mistress is like you know as I've said

before just don't aim for anything

important and people count as important

mm-hmm yeah people count is important

but theater okay just give them a good

scare as night falls D F the door T or

cell opens light spills upon you and

you're not you you're you're sort of

struck by it and it actually feels like

it's battering you you're so

unaccustomed to it from hours of

darkness but then the figure sort of

shines it away from you and just puts

the lantern on the floor and you could

see as she sets it down

she is cloaked in green hood drawn up

silver hair flowing out from underneath

the hood down to the floor and beyond

she's got extraordinarily long silver

hair pale slim hands okay not someone I

recognize at all no and she comes over

to you and there is something about her

that suggests even though she looks like

to be of a human woman maybe in her 40s

early 50s she's very well kept very well

preserved and there is a there's

something in her eyes that tells you she

is much much much much older yeah and

okay

she says this doesn't seem right for one

who has defended our city against the

depredations of a crime lord

my name is Laurel silver hand I'm the

open Lord of water demon i albany diaz

can really respond right now to again

madden imagines like caught in the

corner yes yeah just just paying

attention she notices that you're in

this state and she just sort of leans

and a little bit crutches down and says

I'm gonna help you consider it a

repayment for all that you've done

yes just kind of looked back at her more

confused suspicious at the same time but

also like also desperate okay and just

kind of like gives like little quick

like nods as a like acknowledgement okay

paulten Evelyn you returned home as

evening falls Strix is back you've had

she's making a sign to that just says

welcome home DF like a little pennant

from like the top of the of the like in

room and she's like currently like just

like putting little like party favors

like hanging every little strings and

stuff Aldens like looking over the the

cards that were given to them to kind of

like maybe assess which of these places

might be like the highest-paying okay

this could be this is why these places

could work yeah it could be better rates

yeah you know the city well enough to

and you know the place is well enough to

know which ones are the ones they are

going to earn you the most money mm-hm

and you could also see that one of the

cards is actually a card belonging to a

noble family

the make sure I get the right one here

did you do the growl hoods and so you

don't know what that's about

okay Rowand yzma it might be the winner

yep do I know about them you do well so

you know that growl hund is a noble

family in water deep they have a villa

not too far from where you live actually

so troll skull alley is between Dells

Orange Street and Ser Doon Street in the

North Ward if you were to travel east

along either of those two streets you

would eventually come to growl and villa

about two blocks just two blocks from

where you are maybe we could have a big

like house party show there and go

charge of cover oh yeah that's a good

idea yeah Stu let's uh we should talk to

them ASAP Warrington Mont comes barging

in

oh good and you see I've had tremendous

luck of late look at this any unwraps on

top of the piece is something really

hard on top of the glass case where the

pies are stored and easy unwraps it and

you see paltin it looks like a giant

version of your gund only much longer

and much heavier looks like it must

weigh about 50 pounds why is it every

time

Warrington shows back up is like whoa

look at this Warrington what is is that

some sort of oh I've had it commissioned

of course

built by hand to customs specifications

ah what do you think of this Pippin

um bitter the must what yeah that looks

dangerous as all hell

what is it please take it off the PI's

this my dear is a rifle you shoot things

with it shoot and you just you just had

it commissioned yes I told the artisan

what I wanted and he crafted it for me

it's taken on a week but err it's done

what about well it's just like why is it

so easy to get guns around here Jesus I

had to trade in some old medals I feel

rather bad about that but it's worth it

so don't you think yep and he holds it

he poses that looks really nice yeah

palton goes up next to him and like

poses with him pulled for everyone else

in the room to become the third angel on

the other leg finds herself doing this

and can't figure out why my camera is

like slightly off-center so it looks

like there needs to be a third to

balance Strix is just slowly pushing the

container pies away like only one thing

left to do now what's that well test it

of course house why not what does it do

I will take it out of the city here as I

understand it these things are illegal

mmm they're illegal yeah you had it

commissioned it seems really backwards I

don't think that this is a healthy place

for kids one of us is in jail and now

there's a gun again who guns who guns

how do you guys seem to know what these

things are and I have never seen one

before

oh well it's the magic shooty thing I

doesn't matter Warrington has explained

them to us I'm gonna give it a bit of a

Polish and then I'll head out in the

morning good night good night Warrington

please don't shoot it in the house also

two pi in your room do you have a room I

think you sleep in the basement good

good night good night Warrington have a

wonderful night sleep well have fun as

he walks away it's like she needs to get

he needs to be out of this house he's

crazy he's a danger he is he's a hippo

he is it that day and I don't have a

problem with that I'm get me wrong but

you know one of those things do right

but he scares the crap out of me why

he's not so I'm more scared about the

whole like I don't know like you know

planar like like you know mind flayer

like war I don't I'm more worried about

that like guns are guys were like you

know he's he could lure a bunch of nasty

things here right so all the more reason

that he has to go it's fine he's in the

basement standard to me okay are you

looking for conflict at this point just

like is ignoring them and I'm like hey

can you like help me a hang up this

other part of the banner and it just

says like please don't go to jail again

oh sorry like we're both helping but

we're still like arguing there's like

little characters that like strikes is

drawn of death just like trying to look

like they're happy but they all look

really sad there's a knock on the door

and when you crack it open when one of

you cracks it open and maybe one of the

kids does maybe Jax goes that the door

throws it open there is a courier do you

want pie and the questions do your job

and the courier hands Jenks a bundle of

morning glories and a note ah addressed

to evylyn from Todd hi guys this person

didn't want thanks tries to give the

courier pie does he take it

the courier will take the pie okay

thanks Lee thank you Strix is like now

they're supposed to pay for them and

he'll bring the morning glories over to

evil and be like here you go always evil

in

even take something like huh I don't

think anyone's ever sent me flowers

before they could be poisoned better

check them take them they take some it's

like like analyzing them are they pretty

are they poison I make a nature check oh

I will I will make the heck out of this

nature check well that's an out one

likely they're definitely poisoned I can

feel it better better dispose of them

ASAP

it's okay

Warrington has a gun I think that'll

handle this what

look you can't he can't be trusted he

can't he's a God is okay when someone

brings evil and flowers I didn't say

it's okay I'm just saying he's gonna go

test it out he'll need a target you're

so on edge lately like nobody can do

anything right I'm going through a lot

okay it's like dropping the flowers in a

trash can and stomping them down I'm

really stressed out right now

my friends in jail and it's my fault but

I wasn't able to take responsibility I'm

trying to raise money for her but know

when you're lying

freaking okay make an intelligence check

everybody who's inside the building

everybody you can even make one for the

kids if you like hmm 13:9 what didn't

that roll this roll the flat died for

her six okay squidly we're all day not

one okay I I rolled for waffles great

keen but she will never be able to tell

any strix got 16 and Jenks got 15 okay

Strix you know as partners going off

about money and paying for debts freedom

you know that DF is was basically in

charge of the party's funds and

had a sizable sum of gems from the Zanna

thar's lair great tuck dainty no

somewhere here perhaps or maybe he put

them somewhere else but you don't know

what he did with them but you know that

you're actually quite well off all right

I'm not gonna sell them okay cool I

think it's great that Paulson is taking

and the teeth would be proud she's back

for a second and she'll just let go and

try and see if she can find any of the

gems like in places she knows that D of

hides things like maybe she's seen him

do it before I don't know maybe he told

her what do you tell her no it's like I

made a pie out of these gems it doesn't

tell anyone any of that yeah you're

gonna go on a hunt she's gonna go on a

hunt and search around of what she knows

about deaath and where he's gonna hide

things okay it doesn't it doesn't bear

any fruit for the rest of the night and

then you kind of get tired of looking

and decided well we gotta go to bed

tomorrow all right

I'm disappointed okay

on the fright of how well do you hide

things I do I find skin of the oh no the

Strad door is already gone that's right

yeah yeah at least I find like a nail

back there that's weird even like is

aghast that Paulson just like stomped

her flowers but does she does she

believe him that they were poisoned

that's entirely up to you I guess she

thinks it's a possibility but she's like

could you have at least let me check

those before you stomp them sorry thank

you

she opens the note what does the note

say no could be poison sorry of it thank

you I'm down

it says thank you for the smile thank

you for the smile wow what a trihard

jeez what do you mean nothing

he's just that I don't know man like

he's trying hard to be nice he does seem

to be trying real hard to be nice I like

that I think I don't trust it there's

there's something more of this I'm kind

of code for something why do you think

that I think I think I think he's trying

to have us murdered I think to death I

think I need a drink

I'm gonna go leave about it okay bye

okay like not not to his room he like

goes out the front door as soon as you

throw up in the front door DLE standing

there

[Laughter]

okay all right that's definitely not DF

something's up yeah the Strix is like

stomping down the stairs and she's like

what I got decorated keep it to her

clothes strods back it's shot what is

wrong with you people and fight huh she

moves falton out of the way no great

yeah and she's like how did you get out

when she opens the door after Paul dead

shot it on them Diaz just giving this

face her back what happened come in come

in yeah yeah if that is your real name

oh how do we know run up and give them a

hug to be like walking backwards is it

earlier it's earlier than you were

supposed to be back right do you like

hugs restricts too and just says yes

yeah I'm home early

well that's good we decorated

palton walks up to him and just like

glares I'm like right in his face

and then just kind of like sniffs him a

little it's like behind his ears like

[Music]

yep it's him trust me I know don't ask

why I know that you need anything are

you hungry do you need food are you okay

she's just like immediately starts like

asking like if he needs anything tell us

what happened do you look over at Rick's

and we'll say yeah yeah maybe some pie

would be good I sit down she like pushes

him towards a chair

yeah he'll go and sit and he'll just

tell everyone that someone came to me

and paid for the bail and got me out

they said they wanted to help who was it

I'm not I'm not sure I didn't I didn't

even get a name do you have like I'm

like I'm like another group of friends

are you

are you adventuring behind our backs no

not doing so just is it the pancake gang

I know it the only stipulation is I

won't get my stuff back and till the end

of the sentence so for now I'm just in

my clothes wait you won't get your stuff

back right that's weird

even like Russell's around and she's

like I have a couple extra like you want

a short sword how about a crossbow do

you want the dagger maybe a javelin

she's like host Rick's is gonna bring

him some tea and some pie and just sit

it down next to him so that he can eat

this might not be the time to bring it

up but I'm actually concerned about the

health of this house all we eat are pies

there's no there's no way we're getting

proper nourished

there's vegetables at mum what's

nutrition good point yeah I guess do you

think it's just kind of looking a bit

forlorn

maybe a little thin in the face and just

trying to eat pie what did what did the

person I do you think you'll ever see

that person again do you know why they

let you out I don't I don't know we

don't know it was hard to get a good

read I don't really fully understand but

I bet something from me it was an angel

of Lysander because the theatre didn't

want you to suffer for something that

you didn't do meaningful look at paltin

because Lysander loves us all and wants

us to be happy I don't think it's an

angel

[Laughter]

angels can look like all sorts of things

the Angels have money I suppose they

could if they wanted to huh hey I guess

I bet it was a blessing of Allah thandor

yeah you know what probably was evil or

someone who wants something all right

or I think that's the case too maybe it

was uh someone disguised as someone who

we know from the past you want something

I don't didn't recognize them or maybe

it's someone we from the past that we do

know that was disguised as someone that

we don't know maybe someone we don't

know that is someone we do know from a

past life disguise I don't I lost it

it's alright Strix will press did you

take the decorations down and be like

okay I tried well thank you strikes I

appreciate that

alright you looked lovely thank you

speaking of someone wanting something uh

dear Phil Stan interns turned Walton go

you owe me

this feels like an interesting

conversation there's not much of

conversation here to have just you're

welcome you owe me so we haven't

confirmed but I'm assuming this is about

you serving out that sentence for the

line that I stole yeah and that was

after I had asked you to do that right

oh I didn't that's right

so if I was going to volunteer to do

that not even volunteer I was gonna fess

up and you I I was completely ignored

and then you hopped in for it

why would I owe you oh I'm sorry I did

something nice for you I didn't want you

to do this you show a little gratitude

no none of us wanted you to go to jail

yeah yeah I was gonna go I don't want to

go to jail anyone anyone to go to jail I

would have rather have gone i man I can

hold my own in jail dude like at least

do something something nice for you

you've done a lot of nice stuff I think

what palton is trying to say that he

once said to me was that sometimes it's

harder for your friends to watch you

suffer than for you to just let your

friends suffer for their own

consequences aka yes strikes is like

cleaning the table now so hard that

there's just like a hole in it just like

we're finish she's just like no it's

fine I agree no one we suffer from

watching you suffer does that make sense

digging in the table yeah sure it makes

sense I don't care and I'm gonna hold

you to this we need a while that I did

something for you um you want you want

me to

you for doing something stupid that was

stupid for keeping you out of jail

you're welcome and rain okay really

appreciate it

yeah it'll pick up his pies like I'm

gonna go for the night wait what no he

walks up the stairs is this even is that

should I go poke him to make sure that's

really Deus I'll be right back there's a

big tree there's a big boom on the floor

underneath you down in front I'm sorry

did I what did I do something like just

like I tried to I tried to help him and

then I tried to fess up and I tried to

serve that sentence and then I tried to

go out and work days and nights palton

it's not your fault he's something's

wrong with him I don't know what's wrong

with him but it's not your fault

he shouldn't me he shouldn't have taken

the blame he should have let you go

because jail that messes him up and he

should have let you go because you would

have been fine and just spent the whole

time thinking about whatever you think

about I don't want to think about that

so yeah I do fine in jail it's like I've

done it before it's not a big deal you

know you go there you go before well I'm

gonna go check on dear I'll be right

back which which time what I mean with

all of the times look I mean it was like

it was really minor things who was

mainly you know I don't know when you

when you've played some of the freaking

div' holes that I played then you

sometimes you need you do some stuff

that people would call illegal you know

like starting fights or you know Strix

this conversation becomes more distant

as you make your way up into the house

and find the acid or closed she's gonna

knock

yes what's wrong with you I'm just it's

been a long day and I'm just I'm on edge

of this can I make sure that you're not

a magic copy of you and or someone who's

not you and come in for a minute and

maybe do some tests you were just very

angry and AH you know it's just you

didn't even finish your pie you took it

with them yeah okay good yeah you're

writing your pie dad I guess when she

says ideas it kind of opens the door and

just like oh just walks in like kind of

stomping and you also noticed that some

of your stuff has been overturned just

like oh sorry I was looking for money so

that we could get you out of jail you're

very good at hiding it oh thank you but

you're trying to okay what's going on

why what number one you shouldn't have

taken that fall for Paulson he would

have done it and he would have been fine

in jail it terrifies you what am I

supposed to do just not help him no

you're supposed to you don't hear us

check canonically I don't hear you but

yes he's supposed to take the fall for

his own actions not you every time you

sacrifice yourself it hurts us imagine

if I did that imagine if I went to jail

how would you feel for you how would you

feel devastated exactly

so I risked myself to bring you up high

just so that you would be okay because

it's you personally should never have to

be in a cage we know that you're scared

and we don't know why you won't tell me

is he will talk about it but there's no

reason why you should suffer like that

you should have let Paulson do it and he

wanted to do it because he cares about

you I don't know that's right it is

right I don't think he does yes he does

that's something that really struggled

with and I guess now I just accept he

cares about you he would take that he he

he would have taken that fall for you

it's not it wasn't yours to take you

took his power away it wasn't yours well

maybe for once was good someone took his

power away that I agree with because he

has too many guns DF is trying to like

reset his room that was really rifled

through then after a moment

it just says did you find any money no

all right good but I know we have some

and we just want to get you out of jail

and you know I don't even use money yeah

I know but you just have to you can't

keep sacrificing yourself you can't

restrict your notice he looks really

tired I'll let you I'll let you go but

just just know that you're not alone and

she'll just like walk out the door and

just kind of just kind of like angrily

like closes the door I think she's like

pissed

leaving DF actually reaches out and

grabs her hand she screams but she's

still holding just like he'll get killed

killed like after grab her hand he'll

actually kind of step closer to her and

they'll say maybe you're right Strix and

I appreciate that and it turns out when

you're in a jail cell you have a lot of

time to think and I've just been

thinking a lot and I just

I need you to know that I really I need

you here and he'll like polar and for a

hug yeah so chill hug it back and you

know as she says I don't want you to go

away again I need you here yeah and do

you put take one of his hands and

actually slide it up and put it on one

of her cheeks and as he like kind of

pulls away for a little bit and just

stares into her eyes she's like blushing

which like I don't feel like on strikes

just looks like I don't know like like

darker maybe but she's just like like

she's like but she like you've never

seen her blush before but she's

definitely blushing

keep that hand hairs in just whisper

they need you and then slides his hand

back down holds her hand with both hands

and then let her leave yeah she's just

like she doesn't really

she's like it doesn't know what to do

she's gonna I'm just like like still

holding his handle let's go and just

kind of like just backs up like this

like out the door like and she's like

sweating and YouTube she immediately

goes to evil and she's like when she

walks back down paltin is like finishing

his story he's just like and that's how

the third time I went to jail that's how

I became TV I see there that's how the

system works are you okay even like

checks are over for wounds now you guys

is fine she's just like sweating

flustered curse you're a curse come lay

down

evylyn takes her to a room she's like I

think

gonna throw up even gets her bucket what

happened did you like eat something bad

did you let the pies go bad again

oh no that was last time I fear what

this time I don't know why I'm gonna

throw up because I don't know what

happened I was just like I was talking

to D if then he got really close to me

and then put his hand on my face and now

it is and it's like I'm just I can't

deal with it right now and I'm just very

scared and it's just I think I'm

overheating I think I'm gonna throw up

Oh Bolton was gonna sneak out it is okay

where's ballsy where spot we're going

out like out of the building out yep oh

yes could you remove curse on Strix

please you're you're cursed

yes I'm cursed can't you see something's

wrong with my face Ellen's try remove

the curse Oh

remove curse got it spell you know

mm-hmm he like uh I'm assuming Strix is

probably like hunched up right now about

it unless she I mean probably she's

probably lost all form of a human and

it's just like she's just probably like

throwing plates at a wall yeah she

started like breaking pie plates see I

think he like bends down and like puts

his hands on her shoulders is just like

stop it like takes off running into the

kitchen huh okay well I'll it's fine

thank you for trying out Paulding it's

fine where you going he's just like I'm

gonna do a run does anyone want anything

while I'm out maybe no grocery shop or

you need eggs or you know like anything

to remove

curses I don't know strikes do we need

any pie ingredients all you hear is

maybe okay well I'll see ya you taking

anything or anyone I will take Simon

with me okay Simon and paltin leave it

even goes to the kitchen to ask for Girl

Talk details about this face touching

she heard about you can't you don't see

Strix but you definitely hear her

breathing heavily in her panic cupboard

where the spore does paltin go he goes

to find some wine

alright so his his his specific wine of

choice his usual stop to write to shop

so you walk down dells Orange Street

heading west you cross the high road

which at night is not very busy and then

across copper Street and shields Street

and a bunch of other streets making your

way through the sea Ward you cross the

sea Ward and make it to the West Gate

which you can see the West Gate is the

only gate of the city that looks out

over the sea and beyond the West Gate

there really isn't anything except an

expanse of mud flats that does not make

for ideal beachfront property and this

thick sort of grasping sucking mud isn't

terribly problematic for one of your

height to navigate and typically when

you've come out this way Simon has kind

of written on your shoulders and you

begin to make your way through the gate

while many of the guards are asleep are

not paying attention and head out across

the mud flats under a starry sky and you

can hear the crashing of the waves

against the rocks as you cross the

sucking mud until you get to a series of

rocky outcroppings near the northwest

tip of the city you're outside the walls

City at this point basically just

staring into the dark see but you know

this route by heart having traversed it

many times and you climb onto a tall

jagged rocky outcropping and begin to

lower Simon down into the water are all

right go get him son all right and he

disappears beneath the briny depths near

where you can see the spars of an old

ship poking up lodged against the rocks

you can also see what appears to be a

piece of mast coming up above the

high-water line and Simon goes down

below and swims down into this wreck and

begins to navigate as only a small

figure of his design Ken swimming and

paddling through this sunken wreck and

some sharks down there seemed to pay him

little heed as he swims down digs

through some nets and things and cracks

open a familiar chest and pulls out one

two three you can carry in his little

satchel three bottles of wine and then

he packs them away and swims back up

never having had to take a breath mm-hmm

when he surfaces you pull him up onto

the rocks and he hands you the bottles

of wine from the sunken wreck what a

father-son activity there it is there it

is good job son that's good stuff mm-hmm

yep he gives you a thumbs up all right

son let's bring this home this was

shopping all right day two everybody

wakes up in the morning strix you're

sort of puffy faced like crying yep

you wake up and do your usual morning

habits as though nothing happened now

that Dee's home the family has been

reunited stir she's avoiding DFO because

now she doesn't know what to say yep

she keeps looking like a glance like huh

what's what's what's important on your

days docket evylyn will probably need to

talk to death that you can do casually

if he if he deigns to show himself i

assumed yet you're just trying to get

back into your routine

yeah he's he also doesn't have his

equipment there something's probably

it's probably down in the the main

bakery yeah area to work the shop i

guess great when anyone sees him in the

morning she's like good morning dear how

are you if this looks up betty lenses

I'm fine you know that thing a long time

ago that we talked about that I've been

keeping us horrible painful secret for

so long you remember that thing that you

told me yes just looks at earth yeah

just such an interesting time to think

about that right now

considering that strict seems ill

somehow it's almost as though someone

had touched her face like I just had a

lot of my mind I just maybe it was time

I show her how much she means to me

[Laughter]

that's an interesting idea

why are you guys whispering up there

nothing just hope he has a wonderful

first day free from jail she just like

Chuck's him on the back and she's like

you think that he's cursed

yes I do

Oh No I don't know why she's looking at

death for more clues as to what she's

supposed to say Oh cursed with hunger to

eat this delicious pie ah that sense of

humor that you always have you guys are

being super weird and I don't care for

it don't make this weird

just come on I wasn't gonna make it you

know just like yo nice you know done

okay okay fine nice just what's the

business been doing well

yesterday's public partners the morning

greets you you are a little bit

concerned as you and Simon were

returning to home with your stash that a

couple of the guards may be starting to

pay a little too much attention to your

is it Todd forays they want my wine

probably gonna find it and steal it well

that's a problem for tonight um any way

deal with that later

um I'm gonna talk to e Boleyn okay she's

like hey we should go to the Grauman's

place oh we still get to do the show it

is that not is he was bailed out but is

the fine paid did he say the fine was

paid I think he did yeah yeah yeah yeah

I mean we could still see the show I

you want to play even for no reason I

always like it when you play okay sure

let's let's still head over there see if

over her curse tricks uh-huh uh remember

designer was no well a lighting designer

is someone who makes really pretty

lights and magic at a concert uh-huh and

that's what you're gonna be for Pelton's

next show you know magic and you're good

at it this sounds like you're just

trying to get me to do work to make

Paulson look fancier yes but then it

makes more money for everyone that's

true and then if more of us go to jail

we can all bail each other out more yeah

putting on your fancy clothes no I'm

just leaving on my normal course it's

fine we're gonna go play the have you

heard of the grounds

responsibility really you raised money

right hopefully the show goes well - oh

thanks aren't we all going together uh

we can all going together

family trip I was gonna stay behind run

the shop I feel a little naked alright

yeah any other time we do this like

freaking demons and crap shows up we

went to a chair con once and still had

to fight stuff oh right chair con not my

favorite panels for chair con this year

I forgot all right so you're gonna head

out without death yes death will stay in

mind the shop as you guys make your way

down the sunny Street you can see after

a couple blocks house growl hunt looming

before you it is it is a two-story

mansion on the corner of a lot there is

a wall attached to the mansion and a

detached carriage house this wall

encloses the private property or the

private estate of the Grauman's it's a

tall 12 foot high stone barrier

with iron gates set into one side of it

and even see some Ivy creeping up from

the inside of the wall you can see some

trees rising up above the height of the

wall

these trees growing on the inside of the

growl hunt compound and so so the

entrance is on Horn Street as I said it

is an iron gate when you approach it it

doesn't seem to be guarded and it

doesn't seem to have any lock on it do i

as as even a surveying the property does

she see anywhere that looks like it

would be like a dope setting for the

performance oh well the house itself if

it's if it's if it holds to the grandeur

that it's outside promises it probably

has like a conservatory or a ballroom

inside it it's genuinely huge it the

carriage house is also quite massive

and as you creek open the gates they

just sort of squeal loudly on rusty

time-worn hinges you can see the growl

hund name worked into the wrought iron

of the top of the gate and there is a

path that leads up to the main doors of

the house and a path that veers around

the house to the carriage house tucked

behind it and I said there's all sorts

of trees growing here and they're sort

of and everything is sort of in the

early spring so a lot of the trees still

don't have all their leaves

looks well it looks well-tended this is

nice

I wish DF could have seen it why they

were so sad

let's see some trees he's had a long

week you just got out of jail that's

true

fired so what kind of lights do you want

Paulson do you want like exploding

lights or like pretty lights er uh we

can probably determine that once we

assess what the actual venue will be so

if they want us to do an outdoor thing

we could probably do a big show if it's

like an indoor thing we might not want

to kill anyone so why don't we knock the

door and see what we can come up with

evil knocks on the door as you make our

way over to the door and knock on it to

evylyn strix and palton you sort of hear

a raking sound or something like that

and then you see a figure over in the

trees basically clearing weeds out with

a garden rake and it is a an old human

male groundskeeper and you can see there

are two big dogs with him one of them is

sort of lounging on the grass the other

one is sort of sniffing around in the

bushes but these are Mastiffs they're

really big and as the knock happens it

sort of gets his attention he shoots a

darting glare over at you and there is

kind of a look to him that's a little

unsavory you don't like the way he's

looking at you just kind of like yeah

yeah he turns away and goes back to work

actually no he he stayed he just sort of

stops working and sort of leans on the

rake and just sort of stares and the

door opens and a servant in house growl

hund livery with ruffled sleeves and a

ruffled neck shirt opens the door looks

out with pale face and she said or he

says yes may I ask who's who's coming

who's now King what is your purpose here

kind of turns to evil and just like TM

hello I'm here representing a

enterprises

this is paulsen SEPA who you know as you

left your card for him and we were here

to inquire after what kind of

performance you might be interested in

takes out the card he looks at the card

oh my goodness well yes come on in I

will see if lord and lady growl Holmes

can attend to you hmm

sisters like leaning on our staff just

like looking at my hair right you are

these things is not like the other it's

true enough you are led into a Great

Hall and you can see iron chandeliers

hanging from the dark mahogany ceiling

and you can see lining the wood paneled

walls or tapestries there also some

cabinets with accoutrement that the

family has collected over the years and

wants to put on display for all of their

guests to see as soon as they arrive

there is also a fireplace dominating one

wall with a black marble mantelpiece

above which has mounted a framed family

portrait that depicts what you assume to

be Lord and Lady growl hunt lady growlin

looks tall statuesque dark hair done up

beautifully Lord growl hunt is shorter

stockier and they seem to have three

young children and a family dog oh it's

just like oh that's nice we should do

that at the house yeah we should do that

too

okay we should okay and one of the

children it's a lot like young enough

that the lady is garland is cradling it

in the picture and you're ushered into

the room and the servant just says goes

up a flight of stairs and tells you

he'll be back momentarily with one or

both of Lord and Lady ground even

important are like collecting house

inspo hmm yeah meanwhile I'm just like

looking for like evil because as

far as I'm concerned like everyone is

evil with this book

okay as you are standing there guards

pour out of all of the doors around you

and you can see they're all wearing the

house livery and then you see striding

among them are several individuals men

and women dressed in black leather armor

with snake tattoos on their body and

flying snakes coiled around their arms

and you hear a voice detached like it's

just sort of floating in empty space and

it's a woman's voice and it says kill

them all

homes just like right six minutes left

in the show of course is gonna ask can I

cast my spell of recall what's that

Michael my spell of recall my word of

recall we shall see next week when we

return once we once we roll initiative

well what do you know like solely in a

fancy house it's like snow I'm guessing

you weren't interested in the show yes

change this is mine wants to go to the

noble noble house manner just like

handing pies like taking little he's

just like what a nice days like

breathing in the air it goes back inside

meanwhile like we're being killed by

snake people it's fine announcement

today or dia senses go off here's go

something's wrong all right what's it

now that's yeah I'm really excited about

this one so excuse me so excited if you

little booth you will be able if you so

of reference to something that we hope
