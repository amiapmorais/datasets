hello welcome to an all-new episode of

dice camera action

[Laughter]

yeah and and Nate's Internet's a little

spotty so if he freezes on us it's

that's why yay yeah but previously

indice camera action

DF went to prison for the crime of theft

a place where he does not like does not

like and while incarcerated there during

his first day he was met by a figure

claiming to be lair all silver hand open

Lord of Waterdeep meanwhile paltin tried

to earn some money to bail his buddy out

doing so successfully on the streets of

the market and upon returning to the

Waffle House not too long thereafter the

crew discovered that deaath had been

released but seemed to be a little out

of sorts and down from his experience DF

took Paul Tain's earnings after after

talking him into doing so and then

palton evylyn and Strix embarked on a

visit to houses growl hunt after paltin

had received a card saying that the

nobles were interested in buying his

services as a super talented musician

and in so doing walked into an ambush

oops set for them by the Zen Terran at

the very end of the session

evylyn Strix and paltin were in the sort

of the central ground-floor foyer hall

of house a growl hunt a vast empty

chamber only now does it appear that the

furnishings most of them have been

removed to create ample space for what

is sure to be a vicious and bloody

battle as streams of house growling

guards accompanied by house bars

harem thugs poured in around them and a

female voice detached disembodied said

in the hollow echoes of the chamber kill

them all d/f yeah they're all silver

hand has crouched down beside you in

your darkened cell and you're all sort

of up in a ball covered up as you were

not really aware of what she's doing but

you did hear a voice say that she was

going to help you and she does say poor

boy and her silvery hair seems to come

alive and it sort of waves on its own

and a strand that reaches out and

touches you okay

now do you remember that time after your

visit to night stone and your brush with

the blood war when you went off to

basically go fishing

yeah along the river outside of the city

just to kind of clear your head and get

away from it all yeah that's where you

are now I'm at that River you're at that

River

you got your fishing pole in hand and

you are fishing and it's a beautiful

morning it's really really early the

whippoorwills can be heard in the

surrounding hills and you see little

fish leaping up out of the river and

beside you is lady lair all silver hand

her long silver hair flowing gently do I

have memories of everything this far yes

okay it's almost as if you have been

transported or it's almost like you're

dreaming of being back here but she is

with you in the dream I guess I'll just

look over to her and just ask is this

now

yes I thought I would take you to a

place where you were happy and at peace

and weren't surrounded by darkness yeah

I mean there's no bars here she looks

around certainly not she says I talked

with magistrate level stone about

relocating you or mitigating

circumstances that might reduce your

sentence to nil and he was surprisingly

obstinate I'd almost go as far as to say

he was holding some sort of grudge yeah

anyway I hate to go over his head but I

will what why because you've done good

things for this city and I feel that

should be rewarded not punished and I

also think that there's more going on

here than meets the eye then how do how

do you know about all of this

after the incident that occurred at the

spires of the morning I became involved

the matter of the bomb threat the theft

all of that crossed my desk I had my

agents do some investigation and that

led me to you and your friends oh well

thank you this is nice but did you just

make sure that they're okay I'll do what

I can in the meantime while you're

waiting for me to release you from here

I think you'll be happier here than you

will be in the cell yeah yeah okay

so he'll sorry so I'm still I'm still

there yes but I'm here okay

I understand would you rather be

somewhere else

I know this is fine you know not too far

away from here thousands of years ago

was the seat of one of the greatest

dwarven kingdoms ever to plant its feet

in the world and thousands of years

before that this place where we are now

was the heart of an ancient elven

kingdom called ill-afford

now I've lived for a thousand years but

I am too young to have memories of those

times but you can still sort of feel

that elven magic here I can see why this

place holds meaning for you

I guess so I hadn't thought of it that

way

when you're older you'll start to think

about such things

and then you turn and she's gone

aha

and you hear something very very distant

it sounds like a door closing like a

metal door but it's like just the the

faintest echo of the whisper of the

closing of the door almost as if it's

barely an echo not really in this mic in

my current existence right huh okay

and then suddenly there's a tugging on

your line you've caught something oh hey

finally plura oh yes you are in the

Waffle House yes I am things have gone

much better than expected you did not

expect things to go quite this fast

after you dropped the card in Paul tooms

hat cool and they decided to sort of

pack up and go chasing after that dream

right away leaving you free to pretty

much carry out the rest of your mission

unimpeded the hitman the hippo man is

gone he took us new toy and went off to

test-fire it somewhere great the little

puppet man went off with his his buddy

palton leaving the children here alone

with you Lirio

excellent oh and you know so you've been

reading des mind for weeks now but you

know surprisingly he was either very

adept he seemed very adept at

compartmentalizing any information

having to do with the money

right but that do knowledge tricks

didn't find it and she did try to look

for it India this room so perhaps

there's something I missed there mm-hmm

das room is near the top of the house

it's actually at the top floor of the

house across from an attic and

so you can make your way up there while

you do the children seem to be busy

visiting themselves with a game of

hide-and-seek as they are want to do and

it's okay it's a big rambling structure

so occasionally you hear them shouting

and then running off now but you also

know that whenever it comes to

squigglies turn if he doesn't find

anybody within like the first 30 seconds

he basically gives up goes to the

kitchen and makes himself a snack and

basically he's his friends hidden in

various parts of the house until it

finally dawns on them that he stopped

playing perfect so they'll be distracted

for quite some time yeah

so I guess there's you go okay up yeah

I'm gonna go up to the dance room okay

you go up to do this room and you start

to dig around you can make a insight

check if you wish yep in order to sort

of gather where death is most likely to

have put the money that the waffle is

that +32 it okay so even when disguised

as death certainly acts exactly like

death in a lot of ways natural ones okay

so you're here you're just starting to

look around looking at all the obvious

places I'm so mad

and you hear creaking floorboards in the

hall outside someone soft-footed has

come up the stairs and you turn around

and it's paltin but no a quick scan of

his mind reveals it is not palton it is

morphe Oh disguised as palton great uh I

was looking ahead and say well glad you

hear but it turns out this was so easy

you weren't even needed

so you got the treasure then ah not part

not quite on that part I know that they

haven't found it in our best place to

look is somewhere in here oh then you

still need me

yes yeah now I know we can read each

other's minds I can read your mind you

can read my mind so there are no secrets

between us let's just say that you may

lead this gang one day and I want to be

your right-hand man mm-hmm

so whatever I can do - and then he he

sort of looks to his side in the hall

and then he sort of does this he palmed

in the house just like just just before

we're getting ambushed just like

gesturing and he said then he turns to

you and says well what do we have here

what's he pointing at when you start

appear out into the hall you see at the

end of the hall across from the stairs

between the two doors the one leading to

your room and the one leading to the

attic storage area there is an old cedar

chest there and it's quite large and

cumbersome with rusty old handles and it

was in the house when you first arrived

Doppel paulten goes over opens the lid

and you see a chubby little boy hidden

inside its Jenks is he a doppelganger -

or display him

all as played by Holly Holly when you

look okay so you were hiding in the

chests expecting squidly to find you at

some point

trying not to be heard when you thought

you heard him coming up the stairs when

the chest is opened you see palton

staring at you and do you hear DF not

too far away yeah I immediately look up

at him and I'm like you don't usually

find me paltin turns to you or sorry

morphia turns to you flurry oh and says

human children are so

you're looking right there gross

although you know this one's almost big

enough to imitate weight said he's like

listening and he's just like does paltin

smell like wine no you're not pausing uh

you you see that you're shutting down

when you pull the wand out he snatches

it throws it away

grab grabs your doll no your albear doll

no and holds it up and says you're too

short you're something bounding up and

down and whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

whoa whoa enough of that yelling crap he

pulls out a knife sticks it in the

albear tears that open drops all the

sawdust out of it until it's just a rag

in front of you as tears well up in your

eyes and says well treasures not in here

I don't like this let's still think our

best option is somewhere within deaths

room knowing him and you probably keep

it close they did say clearly state that

he had the money and then if we run out

of time it wouldn't be hard to install

one ourselves in jinxes place while the

others return he hands you the empty

sack that used to be your stuff Alber

and says here's your stupid bird he

grabs him and be like he's like but when

they get back they're gonna kill you he

leans in really close and says they're

not coming

[Laughter]

I'm gonna punch it I'm gonna punch him

in the junk oh go ahead everything you

2000 here go make a tooth d20 roll 13 oh

okay let's see how that fares yeah I got

like some bags on marbles I'm ready to

throw the Florida oh my gosh can we turn

this into the kids do home alone episode

alright you attempt but he blocks you he

sees it coming he just sort of grabs you

by the wrist really hard and he he

actually sort of sticks a knife into

your cheek a little bit I'm really

scared I'm just like shaking it's okay I

think just put me back in the truck I

won't make a noise please Murphy looks

over to you pluriel waiting for orders

Laurie OH will step forward and Scott

kneel down look at jinkx straight in the

eyes just and just ask shanks do you

know where teeth keeps his jewels and

then as soon as II ask that starts

prodding his mind well he might he might

cuz he they the kids have spent a

tremendous amount of time in the house

themselves while we leave them yeah

exactly

they are curious little bastards they

are very much so so just them since this

is probably just a raw chance that he

knows Holly just roll a 20-sided die for

me

the higher you roll the more likely he

knows a to ok never sounded so happy ok

so there's a lot of blubbering and then

it becomes dry though sure you can but

you have to make a now you have to make

a saving throw okay well I'm gonna I'm

gonna lie and try and say it's um

I'm gonna say it's

it's uh I don't want them to hurt

waffles but I feel like waffles might be

able to defend herself because she's so

big so I'm gonna say it's hidden

somewhere and waffles room okay now

first of all make a deception wrong they

said just a d20 room opposed by your

insight check Florio okay so I got a 13

again jinx likes 13s apparently I also

got 13 okay let's roll again tide goes

the runner oh really

I got a to 13 once more okay and also

[Music]

also

yeah you don't need to make senator

against that no I got a - okay I'm just

I'm just crying but weird strikes and

he's just like yelling he's yelling for

likes tricks and 440th and paltin he's

like please come home we're in trouble

I don't think he knows so just he

doesn't he doesn't know that they're not

no no he doesn't

that's too bad whoever he could still

prove useful check his each other so

someone can become Jencks and install

himself here as an additional mole that

would help us in tremendously all right

back in the chest tubby oh and if you

say anything next thing you know this

chest is gonna be hotter than you could

possibly imagine

Wow I'm warning you though that I know

magic he goes first you don't club all

right and then more Pheo makes his way

downstairs muttering to himself man this

place is a lot bigger than I remember

just keep looking I'll keep searching up

here okay at house growl hund

hmm yes

there are four Santarem thugs in black

leather armor and why do you look

excited jarred like don't eat me smile

and there are 12 there are 12 armed

guards with swords drawn wearing the

house growl hund livery if you are a

character who is present in the

situation please roll initiative now mmm

this is some weird kind of party I'm in

6 6 for evil

12:12

four-pole got a three and three alright

refresh my memory some of you are

unarmored correct like you came here

under the pretense of meeting Nobles for

a performance I don't think I don't

think I ever said I specifically wasn't

okay okay

I'm just I'm just I honestly don't

remember so I I'm just curious as to

what was agreed upon last week so being

that as it may you are then wearing your

armor

evylyn I think even's natural state is

usually all armored and weapon does she

can also get away with it because she's

a representative paladin of the temple

of love and ER mm-hmm and palton wears

leather armor which is not very you know

weird is that style is it protection who

knows who knows exactly fun all right

but you're all caught off guard in this

moment as the guards and thugs swarm you

so really quick like right before the

swarm happens like palton is like

getting ready and then he just kind of

like disappears for like two seconds uh

you are surprised so you can't yet well

he disappears and then he comes back and

is just like what just happened if this

is a mislead thing it can't happen yet

it is not a mislead okay I don't know oh

right yes yes thank you okay so yes your

character did get sort of whooped away

for a split second the rest of you just

see probably like a little flicker I'm

okay we're here we're here got is there

it is I'm there's no there's no spirit

guides there's no singing right wait I'm

back how much wine have you had and

Simon who was with you like may have had

your hand for a second and then you went

away and he like lost his grip on you

in that speech just fragment of a second

moment of confusion for him before you

return okay I'll address that later

that was real that was weird okay anyway

sorry there's a like a crossover thing

that happened really quick all right

let's fight great all right so the the

first thing that happens is the flying

snakes that are coiled around the arms

of the sent armed thugs uncoil and fly

over and begin at costing Strix God

destroy me so they are attempting to

bite you

what is your armor class tricks it is

currently all right oh no it's very it's

currently eleven okay okay

all hasn't aged arm wrap all four are

able to successfully bite you and with

the poison damage added in each of them

does a total of eight damage so that's

32 points of damage cool as you are

beset by black flying snakes

then the Zent thugs will let's see there

are four of them two of them will come

after you Strix oh I see one of them

hits with a mace for five mites ablution

a damage the other one your able to

block almost reflexively with your staff

oh and I bet it looks cool mm-hmm the

other two thugs go over and accost

paltin what's your armor class currently

paltin forty no cos perk is second it

looks like it's actually fourteen very

good yeah literally this week everyone

can see that your left

no my armor class isn't really 40 what a

twist

yeah all right they'll come over and

bludgeon you with their maces each of

them will hit you for five for a total

of ten bludgeoning damage it's like ow

cool ow tight all right

then the house growl hunt guards come at

you did you do and there are four on

each of you so paltin two of the guards

hit you and you take five points of

damage from each of them so another ten

cool and what's great is with the new

extension I can watch my character die

in real time as he's getting hit he's

just like yeah that extension is pretty

cool ow oh I can see how bad it hurts ow

the other eight actually are going to

surround evil and so evil and you've got

guards literally all around you at this

point bring it on boy what's your armor

class 14 that makes it so easy so one

two you are hit three times and critted

once so that would mean 1525 points of

damage total he as you are hacked with

swords while blocking several of them

with your emoji shield or or your weapon

whatever you have an D or your bracers

actually since you probably don't have a

weapon drawn yet you're probably just

some deflecting blades with your bracers

while taking cuts under your guard all

right so they have all swarmed you so

just to recap

palton has two thugs and four guards on

him Strix has two thugs and four snakes

on her and evylyn has eight guards

really not happy about the snakes yep

and there we are

and then it is Paul toons turn

cool so so you said there's four guards

and two thugs

yes I mean cool so I'm gonna look to the

guards and be like like before you do

that you should know that after this job

the thugs are gonna turn on you guys and

take you guys out to you should you

should probably defend yourselves

against them more than us

I'm gonna cast mass suggestion okay I

made a mistake I D&D beyond it

incorrectly my armor class is actually

17 okay you don't have ThreatCon it just

for poker sure I've noted it but thank

you okay so they've got a mix so I got

six saving throws in other words mm-hmm

okay and the DC is 17 okay now your

suggestion was really to the guards that

the thugs were gonna betray them yeah so

it's kind of whatever like guards I can

see maybe not just a four on me just

obviously okay well you can get up to

all of them so oh I would like to do up

to all of them I will make saving throws

for all of them great okay

tracking nightmare okay you will you

sort of get a sense that two of the

guards fighting you are under the effect

of the spell as they begin to evaluate

their life choices right before your

eyes

mm-hmm you see that another big money

oak and other four guards on evylyn are

suffering the same effect okay okay all

right so you've got half of them okay

half of the twelfth cool and do you have

any bonus actions or anything inspiring

yes I do as a matter of fact um I'm

going to let's see well I'm gonna I'm

gonna try I'm gonna have some Bartok

inspiration for Strix if she decides to

fireball okay well that won't

necessarily effect a fireball cuz oh

wait I'm saving throw JK I will

absolutely not do that that was a test

good call yeah I'm gonna sing abling a

little tune okay great

she loves it great at this point in time

Simon opens up his mouth shoots a dart

into the neck of one of those interim

thugs who falls over unconscious yes

this is why this is one of the ones

fighting you paltin sweet at the same

moment hand-drew leaps off your back and

launches itself on the face of the other

Zent armed thug and starts tearing his

face off and you hear screams of panic

as the thug starts running off trying to

pull this hand off his face that's

currently gouging out his eyes as well

good it's good boys good boys they're

all good boys all right next up evil and

you are battle ready you are so ready to

go

but then

while paltin is singing to you a figure

emerges from the shadowy corners of the

room comes over and attempts to

assassinate paltin with a sword to the

back and you recognize this figure as

Herstal flaxen the Zent you caught

outside of chair Khan and the Zent you

let go in the zenith ARS lair she uses

her protection fighting style to yell no

and try to like jump on him as a

reaction but that just imposes

disadvantage on the attack okay then he

has it's a straight role then he hasn't

either advantage and or disadvantage do

I notice this yell you notice her

yelling you absolutely do can I then see

this person tried to assassinate me

u-turn and by virtue of the fact that he

did not have advantage against you that

evylyn sort of negated that and he

rolled a two you see him coming and you

you deny him this chance to be rid of

you you fool you you get out of the way

now he does have a second attack but he

has lost the element of surprise and he

will make that now and rolls a natural

one a okay now it is evil ins turn so it

turns out I think I actually have 18

armor class okay I'm I I'm doing this

live we're doing it live but there we go

anyway I want to go after this mmm I

guess no I'm surrounded so I just have

to I'm I'm just taking out freaking

flaming sword I don't even have a lot of

room so I just put it straight up and

ignite it and I'm like let's get lit and

she just starts spinning and trying this

too much make your attacks

it looks like Austin specifically to see

if you will react to using the word lit

turns like a

mmm-hmm strikes coveted snakes it's just

like this needs to stop

I rolled an 18 first for my first attack

18 a hit and I do oh that's not great

damage what only seven damage no okay

there's also inspiration which will help

your attack rolls oh right

JK future reference I just get to add a

d-10 right

do you ten plus your strength to

whatever attack role I want yeah just

once right no further inspiration yeah

yeah oh oh sorry yeah it's just the d-10

to an attacker Omiya or saving theremin

Oh or sculpture this this attack is a

sixteen that is a hit alright this time

she's like trying to put a little more

oomph into it so that's a 11 okay oh

don't I get to automatically add oh yeah

I automatically add divine smite just

one d8 now up so what did I just say you

said 11 okay so now it's 15 okay that a

previous one should have been plus 2 so

your so let me clear up are you

attacking one guard twice or two guards

each once one guard twice I assume that

I I imagine that she's doing this like

ah and she hit that guy alright with the

two hits you take that guard down ha he

is out dead murdered by flaming sword

alright the first kill of the battle oh

my gosh man I'm making so many D&D

mistakes today I have a bad player today

because someone just pointed out that

the the is the flaming sword one hand or

two-handed because it's a great sword

right artists to edit so I can't use my

shield so my armor class is an 18 it's

16

so your armor classes 16 no shield also

yeah okay and you are rolling to d6 for

the great sword right on your damage yes

okay I just rolled very poorly

yeah no worries the D&D is the game and

sometimes it's hard so everyone can play

D&D and everyone makes mistakes tralala

Lala Strix yes you're up

time to leave are you attempting a spell

I am attempting my word of recall spell

as soon as I see ten Pavilion guards and

now they're dying and things are bad I

was gonna do it before but I rolled

really bad so I must've been panicked

for like the first minute of the fight

well now you can really panic because it

is counter spelled oh okay maybe I

shouldn't have said that at the end of

the episode last week cool so I started

like casted I counter spell a counter

spell yes but in this case since you

don't know where it's coming from I'm

gonna say no so I look around and after

that with my hands level right and I'm

like well yes

now you can because upon casting the

counter spell another person in the room

becomes visible standing in a corner

outside of the battle sort of presiding

watching over the battle is a robed

figure human you guess the cowl of the

robe is up so it's sort of hard to see

all the facial features but it is a man

of pale countenance young by the looks

of it and wet at one point one of his

arms ends at the elbow and attached to

the severed limb is a mechanical arm

with a mechanical hand so that hand is

raised having just cast that spell okay

um this guy's scary right I'm like this

I'm like this person has mechanical hand

and usually if you're a wizard and your

robe is covering your eyes so that your

face is dark it means that you're scary

yes he looks pretty darn scary okay um

all right so I panic and that's my turn

okay we're at the end of the - at the

end of the count DF or sorry Jared I'm

gonna have you roll for pluriel so that

we can have him act during the

initiative even though he's in an

entirely different place

okay so just just like an initiative

roll yeah okay with dexterity six six

all right back up at the top of the

initiative the snakes again a costs

tricks all right it's been it's been fun

tricks with her AC 11 tried to escape

yep counterspell by uh all right well

two of them actually surprisingly miss

with a one and A two yeah one of them

hits and one of them actually crits you

so you take a total of the crit will do

sixteen the extra hit will do eight for

a total of 24 okay well I'm done I'm

down to zero okay strictest falls as

snakes feed on her soft key flesh no

alright well look at that wizard guy as

I'm getting bitten by snakes though and

I'm just like coming back yeah one of it

is now the thugs turn one of the thugs

will pick up Strix is staff fine yeah

the other ones the other one will start

dragging Strix away

all right the two other thugs are busy

one is fighting Hendrik he's going to

try to tear Hendra off his face and

succeeds throwing the hand down onto the

floor and screaming oh what's that oh my

god is that a severed hand nobody told

me there were severed hands for this

mission told me there would be severed

hands and he's done the other side oh

yeah there's like 10 more dude the other

thugs gonna try to wake up and does not

alright

okay the guards of which there is one

less six of them sort of look at the

guards so look at the thugs warily like

they're expecting a betrayal at any

moment and basically to go just take the

did that the dodge action so they do

nothing okay

all right the other five guards attack

evylyn in a fury ah-hoo now we have

established as an armor class of sixteen

two additional fire damage D sixes

thank you chat great okay

it wouldn't have mattered because you

would have killed that guy for that

guard anyway so you are hit twice for a

total of ten out

the other three you're able to block and

parry that smarts

alright not using his reaction this

round but actually acting on his turn

mansion is going to cast a spell on evil

and can I counter spell now yes you can

call the spell is power word kill what

so I don't think you can counter spell

that hi I'm sorry well you hang on

according to counter spell if the

creature is casting a spell a third

level or lower it fails and has no

effect so this is not their level or

lower so if it's fourth level or higher

it's an ability check oh okay so I'm

gonna 5th level level counter well but

before that does even get a saving throw

versus this it hasn't happened yet right

he would have to counter spell before

she could saving through right okay so

if you're using a higher level slot the

interrupted spell has no effect if it's

level is less than or equal to the level

of the spell slot you used so your your

fifth level you can heighten it but that

has no effect so use a fifth level slot

you still have to make a roll okay and

it is an ability check using your spell

casting ability which is charisma so

it's a charisma check okay do 22 swear

to God how does yelling about

jack-of-all-trades which I don't know

what that means does it mean something

to you Nate what's I don't reach okay

so with a 22 that would allow you to

basically counter spell a spell of 12th

level or lower so you are successful no

you don't even need

the decent of all trades is you can add

half your proficiency bonus to any

ability check so didn't need it but

thanks that would have applied alright

so you are successful in counter

spelling at your first ninth level spell

evil ones like thanks yeah and then then

you just see this wizard clench his

metal fist in a tight tight ball and

shake it all right next up is paltin

cool so yeah so those those uh those

thugs are like dragging her out one thug

is dragging around the other one is

freaking out okay cool um let me just go

ahead and read up on this really quick

oh okay cool I'm gonna try and banish

him alright get him to flip out of there

alright so the one dragging Strix away

not the one holding her staff right no

both actually he's holding the staff no

thank you

I see you stabbed them just like no no

leave okay so in order to target an

additional creature you'll have to cast

it at fifth level yep okay then they get

to make two charisma saving throws see

you just seventeen all right the one

dragging Strix disappears the one

carrying the staff remains well mom's

gone so Strix is sort of being heaved up

a little bit by the shoulders and then

when he disappears she collapses on the

ground on the ground alright so one of

the thugs has been banished and will

remain out of combat for as long as you

concentrate up to a minute right yep

great

that's a concentration spell for you

and I think Nate might've froze or he's

just being Barry Nate's Internet has

scrapped out and he will rejoin us

shortly but he got to finish his turn

and that's what's important and now we

come to DF or I should say flurry oh oh

yes stop it yeah

so more than anything else I'm still

looking for that thing which I would

still believe to be India this room as

yes we were discerned to be the most

responsible and trusted of the members

so the question I have for Jared is is

it in fact India's room did I have it

I was on the impression that lady

Escalade had it yeah yeah out of just

spectrum internet yeah but and are we

talking about the the thing or the goal

or the the gems and such uh the gems are

in dears room yeah okay the thing yes

doesn't actually have but right Lori

olds main goal so we're still looking in

there for that yes okay so make an

investigation or yeah make an

investigation check or intelligence I

guess for you

yeah just no bonus yeah 17 you find the

money hmm but you don't find the other

thing okay it doesn't find the other

thing but for the sake of role-playing

and story purposes how how thorough did

pluriel search this room would you say

I'd say pretty thoroughly he he opened

everything he checked the floorboards he

checked the the fireplace he looked for

false okay

doors and walls and under pictures and

things so he did not find a thing he did

not but what he did find yes was a small

lockbox that was carefully stashed away

however even though has a keyhole there

seemed to be no key for it and it seems

to be just big enough that maybe you

could hold on to something so if plaw

rio is unable to open it

he'll just take it with them and find

someone that can yep he also knows that

it is it's not uncommon for thieves to

hide their things outside of windows and

as you kind of throw open the window

just to look around make sure there's

nothing kind of lurking out there you do

see there's a tower attached to this

structure they haven't searched yet

either so that might be another

possibility

another thing upstairs okay and it looks

sort of freshly rebuilt which is also

suspicious hmm indeed okay well got

plenty of money yep I got this sizeable

box I'll do us later but we'll do one

let's check up and there to be sure yeah

okay

so is that your plan now to leave the

room go downstairs and find an entrance

to the tower actually you know you know

where the entrance is it's in Paul

Tain's room

oh well then right below you okay well

then y'all head that way

okay you walk out of deaths room to the

top of the stairs and are surprised

maybe even a touch worried that at the

bottom of the staircase staring back at

you is a growling owl bear good boy good

good boy is this like the only way

there's like yeah get down around so the

upper floor of the the level that you're

on is this hallway and then a room to

one side and a room to the other there's

DFS room which has two windows and the

attic storage room which has four DS

room is closest to the tower as you

contemplate your options and there's no

other exit out of this hall besides the

doors to the rooms as you contemplate

this action the albear begins to creep

up the stairs looking evermore fierce

and big pluriel is DF it's like stepping

back but still trying to like pretend

like he's not panicking right now just

like good good boy you're know you're

not supposed to come up here and as Jax

you can hear all this from inside the

chest that you're okay I'm just like I

was like girl you know I'm like

pretending I'm casting like I don't know

like some buff spell on her like I'll

protect you from that window where I saw

the tower did it look like I could use

that to potentially like climb down and

escape or make my way down yeah

potentially absolutely okay yeah so

considering that with my bag still on my

belt he's just gonna be like good boy

good boy and then I quickly darts back

slam the door okay and imagine like much

like a cat this usually make a sudden

movement like that's when walls starts

charging

right now you hear it's claws digging

into the wood as the albear comes up and

Jenks you hear this sound you haven't

heard before the ferocity of a humongous

beast that your imagination just starts

to go wild and you creeks open the chest

a little bit just to see waffles clamor

up to the top of the stairs missing by a

hair

the the ability to sort of prevent the

door from closing all the way and then

heaving her bulk up against it and

you're not sure that door is gonna be

long for this world

oh I'm just like boys just like you

through the cattle Laurie owes me just

like goddammit more fuel

yeah then plural will be to just go to

that window and look above receive like

maybe yeah get your topper see if you

like climb down to a lower window yeah

probably the best easiest way to get to

the tower would either be to skirt

around the the corner and drop down and

then clamour up the outside of the tower

or climb up them to the roof of the

building you're on and then leap from

that roof to the tower roof and go from

there all right well I don't think

Laurie oh is not it gonna be the best

climber in the world no he feels more

comfortable climbing down yeah doing

something death would do make an

athletic speck yeah he'll try to climb

down I rolled a five you fall alright

yeah so you fall from the fourth floor

past the third floor past oh you hit the

you'll hit the balcony on the second

floor oh so okay so that's gonna be a

couple d6 fall damage though right yeah

it's gonna be like 2d six fall damage so

let me give you that right now

all right so you take eight points of

damage as you crash onto the balcony

below the median hit points in the

Monster Manual oh sure

please if that's all right yeah working

as intended

great alright and we'll come back to you

it is Anna's turn evylyn yeah Jamie ah

Evelyn's gonna run for it's gonna run

for Strix to lay on hands and I know

that'll provoke an attack of opportunity

but she doesn't care several only two

hits you so you take ten points of

damage from the attacks of opportunity

as you rush over to Strix you think that

can hurt me

yeah I rushed over to Strix and I lay on

hands for for tea or tea OOP Wow I

imagine strict sets up like a lot mr. X

it wasn't a dream you're still here okay

and then I'm like wait there's still

snakes you have any other bonus actions

or anything no no all right then we

actually come to you Strix alright first

things first is I see the guy with my

staff and I'm like hmm and I turn it

into a cauldron yeah he's sort of

holding it like this when suddenly he

has to like hold it up here his arm just

goes yeah I'm just like shake my hand

and it just kind of it just kind of

rolls about three feet away from him and

does one of those weird never-ending

plate spins

that made everyone feel really awkward

because now everyone alright um actually

you know what I don't want a fireball

everyone I want to do my spectral

chickens okay that I'm going to cast

spectral chickens at fifth level okay

the wizard is going to try to counter

spell that he has to make another roll

well I'm gonna yell Pike off at him at

the same time very loudly your spectral

chickens are dispelled before they can

materialize its mad okay can I like I

like quick and spell like polymorph on

this

sure okay I'm just so mad I was like

yeah he's already used his reaction so

he can't counter tell you again I'm

gonna quick and spell polymorph on him

all right what's the same thread magic

tactics you bait out the counter spell

then use a better spell that's true

that's true

sixteen all right and it's a wisdom 9

all right I yell he turns into a chicken

[Laughter]

mechanical foot or wing please say yes

of course yes sir

perfect yeah all right okay so that is a

concentration spell for you and last up

to one hour if you like I would like

okay so that's Strix done I guess you

could stand using yeah move yeah Austin

I was from the crown throwing chickens

but actually you could stand walk over

and at least grab the handle of the

cauldron yeah I'll do that all you know

I'll dramatically crawl just okay sure

then grab the side of it and just be

like take them kill the vivillon okay

the wizard has taken

very dramatic doing this indeed all

right we have concluded this initiative

order then and we're back at the top the

wizard hmm is going to try to cast the

spell as a chicken oh that's true he is

a chicken so the question is what to eat

what can you do

while he's a chicken let's see he can

farm he can go

lay an egg Peck one moment please give a

hug you could run around like his head

is cut off ah I think he's gone I think

he's got something across the road

oh my god oh no yeah that's got somatic

components he can you can't but he is

looking for a spell he's racking his

brain now for all the spells he's got

prepared to see which ones might be

simply somatic I just imagined like his

little chicken eyebrows is going like

concentrating really hard

I mean you know I mean actually cheating

in with the somatic because you can't

make gestures with wings

so yeah that's they're like very rigid

specific gestures right yeah it's just a

fun all right so he just hops around

frustrated okay I'm watching this and

just laughing really hard because just

watch it I'm watching him use his wings

try and like trying to talk when it's

amazing all right

guards and thugs

hoo boy 1 thug is gone one thug is

unconscious two thugs are left Strix

you're prone so they'll attack you cool

thugs like advantage one even with

advantage missed you the other one hits

you Strix okay four five all right ow

I'm on the ground evylyn you are

accosted by guards on Mass

one two three of them hits you for a

total of 15 okay that's actually kind of

starting to hurt

oh I forgot the are assassin friend last

round our assassin friend is going to

come after you paltin didn't you hear

nate now he's still working things up oh

say so he's not coming after Paul the

assassin is also going to attack Strix

realizing that if he can take Strix down

her concentration will break so he's got

advantage because he's got allies next

to him Strix he's making two attacks

against you okay the first one world a

natural one and missed the second one

second one hits you with a mighty 13 so

he is making a sneak attack against you

no he's not a black bear no he's not a

giant frog no he's not a swarm of bats

he could be he wishes I never know okay

so here comes the damage oh I need you

to make a constitution saving throw

against his poisoned blade okay I'm

gonna go ahead and use my my fancy

what's it called my fancy sorcerer thing

for my not not empowered healing but the

are nowhere to go a favored by the gods

thing so that I can not die got it

that'd be great yeah the awesome um hold

on I'm trying to find it what do I get

again Oh class features there it is

where is it why can't I find it oh here

it is 2d for that's it that's it so I

roll to d4 and then add it to my outcome

which

a nine awesome it won't be a nine maybe

you'll be more than a nine which would

be great you need more than a nine I

sure do okay so it's a fourteen that

sadly is not enough well so poisoned

blade courses through you including the

poison you take 44 points of damage

cool I'm just holding on to my collar

and just get stabbed pretty much did you

did you roll the save for that yeah

did you add five I did not add five my

close enough to you yeah cuz I just

healed

okay yeah it's a 19 that is actually

enough so instead of two instead of

taking 44 points of damage you take 32

points I have three points you have

eight though cuz you healed up to 35 but

I healed you for 40 when I got took

another five from ya someone else yeah

all right so that is the bad guys and we

are with Paulton if palton is with us i

don't know them i can eat here yeah cool

cool are you definitely not are you on

your phone no I'm on my laptop okay

which is now hot spotting from my phone

this is technology so so while the

current situation is Strix Herstal

flocks in just tried to kill Strix with

a poisoned blade but thankfully Evelyn's

intervention she has she is clinging to

life and her cauldron as it turns out

hooray there are thugs and guards

everywhere

guards highly suspicious of the thugs at

this moment and you're up the wizard oh

by the way the wizard was turned into a

chicken by string oh cool is he still a

chicken yes he's so chicken but Strix is

is very badly injured attempting to keep

him a chicken right now

okay so what what's immediately on me so

at the moment nothing

Oh what's in within a 15 foot cube of me

just asking so within a 15 foot cube of

you is Strix and Herstal flaxen the

assassin and two thugs and probably all

actually everybody everybody except the

wizard okay

so because you can project the cube out

away from you right so I'm gonna

I guess all uh this isn't this isn't

looking good right my gist is just like

alright better blow up about it oh

this is a nice house though that's fair

all right thunder wave kaboom you're

hitting literally everybody I mean I

prefer not to hit my friends well if

you'd like to get your friends out of

the blast that's a whole different tale

in that case you can probably clip the

assassin alone or clip three of the

guards fighting evil in I will clip the

three guards okay

Satan throws for all of them mmm-hmm so

this will be at the fourth level okay

give me some damages I will give you the

damages oh so yeah that's one right so

that's four five d8

normally it's to d8 right and so you add

dive so each level so five D 5 D 8 cool

alright so cool

come on 15 ow

okay two of the guards go flying away

from evil and blast me backwards and

head over head-over-heels by the thunder

wave which everybody can hear loud and

clear those guards do not survive the

third guard made his saving throw is

still alive but is bloodied and did not

get blown off his feet hmm no but there

are far fewer guards on evil and now

cool would you like to do anything else

move or you happy where you are um I'm

gonna I'm gonna you know just keep

reading the room okay

Simon is going to try to take out

another thug with a dark yeah use all

right he is successful the thug fails to

save and falls over unconscious cool

Andrew okay oh yeah he's fine

in fact the thug the thug that is

startled by andrew is so terrified of

death like actually severed hands is his

childhood fear and see how that worked

out he's like crawling up on the

mantelpiece to get away from this thing

and andrew is just haunting him Andrews

never had so much fun fun before yes

cool all right and yeah and so that's it

for those guys which brings us to DF aka

pluriel toppled the earth okay so I just

fell down yeah you'll and I'm really

 hard on this wooden balcony yeah

looking up at the window that you just

fell out of and wondering how you could

possibly still be a lot like dammit

slowly get up just okay there is a door

off this balcony as well as windows and

your if you go through the door you

think you get to the tower pretty

quickly yeah I don't want to climb down

anymore so we try to get through these

doors okay well it can be very trusting

because the doors unlocked

okay

so you walk in and you realize that this

long room that you're in is actually the

den of the albear or the door across

from this one is hanging open and you

can see toys half torn apart not upon

scattered about the room as well as a

big pile of hay which the elder has made

into a bed all right I'm on my way

toward that other door I'm gonna likes

quick scooped up one of these toys oh

yeah okay you scooped up a toy you head

to the door you climb you go to the

through the common room into the hallway

up the stairs and can hear farther

farther up in the house of the albear

doing its work to try to get through the

door yeah and I'm gonna try to like

stealth my way to Paul tooms bedroom to

get to that terrific NAT you've you've

given up on squiddly ever finding you

and you suspect probably he's down in

the kitchen making a sandwich when you

come out of your hiding place in the

guest room where you where you sleep you

open the door you see death creeping up

the stairs she she signs to him like she

tries to get his attention

d/f you see out of the corner of your

eye this little girl in the doorway

below you trying to get your attention

and you know it's her just look over to

her and I go Shh I'm looking for jinx

I'm playing to she's like oh you're

playing hide-and-seek

at this point pluriel realizes he does

not know sign language at all she looks

at him like so he just kind like help me

find Jencks why are you not saying it

and thieves can't

I thought that was a thing I think he

somewhere upstairs I'm gonna go check

Paul tans room man it's like is he under

a spell like she starts following him

curiously two tries okay if she can do

that she skulks behind him as she's done

many times yeah he goes up to Paul

Tain's door interestingly not locked

walks in and you can peer through the

doorway he seems to be going toward the

tower door looking for jinx do I

are we we're not walking past that chest

we're jinx is in right no that's that's

one level up okay and that's and you

don't hear waffles the albear bashing at

the door right above your head I don't

feel the vibration through the house

because that would cause no it's too big

a house uh I I guess I mean that has a

lot of faith in Diaz so unless there's

something like a very I guess she'll

here's what she'll do

so she's following you around and he's

still like ignoring her and still not

talking to her so she's gonna like again

try to get his attention and then be

like should I do something wrong in some

in sign language he looks very bad uh do

I see you're actually doing the sign

language yes and you also see more Pheo

coming up behind her

and Vic he doesn't have a weapon out but

he looks like he might try to grab her

and he's clearly aware of the raging

albear I'm going to pluriel look down at

NAT and then try to quick prod her mind

to figure out what the heck she's trying

to do okay you pick out symbols that

mean things out of her mind that's not

helpful it means that you can understand

how she's communicating with you okay

and use like she's expecting she's

expecting a response with certain signs

you now know what that response is and

what those signs are okay I try my best

to impersonate that whatever response

she wants okay make a deception check

against Nats insight which is just a

flat d20 roll for you Anna Oh eleven

eight you it up

I think what the way that that comes

across I'm assuming is like it's like

hearing deer speak but with a really

heavy accent she's the sign he's got set

he's also got the signs sort of

backwards he's like talking backwards in

sign language Nate sees her not sees

this and she's like and then she just

turns in grunts you've turned and run

right into paltin who just grabs you

almost protecting almost preventing you

from falling can she try to fight the

grapple sure Ken make a d20 roll nine

you're successful she stomps on his foot

just run okay you bolt out the door and

more Pheo starts cursing and says - if

that L bear comes down here we're gonna

need something to trade NAT is going

straight for the out bear you don't know

where the al bear is well ball to her

den is where she was going oh okay so

that would be so from where you are that

would be down the stairs you just came

hmmm pluriel we'll just look at more

feel in just be like

grabber do not let her warn the others

and then he'll like dart his way up to

the turret running out of time

alright NAT you become acutely aware

that you're being chased down the stairs

she starts like she takes out her sword

and starts like banging on the wall as

she runs which I think I'm I'm imagining

would be her like panic sound that she

used to do for the adventurers like if

things are going crazy she just starts

making a huge racket with this wooden

sword yeah

now you if waffles is in the den you're

probably like you're two doors away from

being there so you'll be able to get

there with up with a burst of speed

there's also between you and there the

spiral staircase leading down to the tap

room which puts you within stone's throw

of where you assume squigly must be not

is specifically thinking that these are

like some sort of intruders or that

deaath and Politan are under some sort

of messed up like mind-control spell

she's specifically going for waffles as

like the battle goes then you run into

waffles den and you don't find her there

so she immediately turns tail and tries

to run downstairs then okay that is

going to require another attempt to

escape from Doppel paulten as he tries

to grab you going down the spiral

staircase six he grabs you she's squirms

God he starts to drag you back

patting him with the wooden sword go you

know ow ow he says you don't hear him

but he winces under the flat of the

blade but doesn't let you go smoothly

and jinx don't hear the alarm sound what

as Matt still had that real dagger

alright that brings us to evylyn evylyn

will go for she was standing over Strix

and just healed her so whoever

most menacing districts is who evil ins

gonna stab savvy all right which will be

a 22 to hit a 22 is a hit and that'll be

a 19 Wow you kill that guard ah rethink

your life for the line of next two

seconds before it's called second attack

that one oh that's an at 20 oh my gosh

okay I haven't ruled one of those a long

time so that's double dice right yep

double alter all right then I just I

know that's the eight

33 all right you you just cut this

garden half with your flaming great

sword and his his halves fall down to

the floor

smoldering horrifying all the other

guards in the room at the the brutality

of it I imagine that this is because

last time when even got hit and she took

those 15 she was like okay this is this

has been quite enough and she goes into

like playing around alright Strix you

see a guard cut in two by the flaming

sword what do you do it's time to leave

I would like to cast my recall spell to

get us back to the house okay there is

nobody to stop you no that's so at this

point in time I need to know exactly

where you are teleporting you and your

friends to in the Waffle House um where

would she go we they we always go to the

same place where the runes are drawn

which is in the the panic room or the

storage room next to Strix his bedroom

got it the one that the kids have been

using is a bedchamber yeah exactly so

they've been sleeping in there but on

the ground like probably underneath a

bunch of hay and other stuff are the

runes that she's drawn I'm guessing what

I probably look like your staffers okay

BAM evylyn paulten Strix you appear in

this room on the second floor of the

Waffle House that you appeared in before

I'm holding on to my staff by the way

you know immediately you hear the sound

of Nats tapping sword her alarm sound

and it is only it is almost right

outside in the hall and up the stairs

right outside this room so that was

Strix astern Strix do you want to move

at all

I'm gonna turn my staff into my regular

staff not in the colony

actually no I'm gonna turn it into the

the pie pan because I'm ready to like it

hit some peeps on your face alright

alright and that's it all right we're

here waffles as well yes you would also

hear farther up in the house the sound

of a

or splintering apart and kids how many

times have I told you not to shot

waffles up German Strix is like if

that's the alarm

Jenks you hear that voice coming up the

stairs oh my gosh jinkx is gonna push

the little the chest open and run

towards Elin just make a beckoning Toni

roll for me okay seven okay you get a

little flustered and kind of half

stumble down the stairs as you go and

you can you skin your skin your knee at

one point but now you can now you can

hit now the rest of you can sort of hear

Jenks stumble and cry my kimi e

revealing my kitty he's like England

evil and falsity there evil in India

squib a you're sitting at the bar

downstairs

eating your sandwich my god what's going

on no there you know you don't see him

oh he's by himself he's he's the only

one on the ground floor right now I've

just been hearing this yeah next is new

squid lethal like like this whole time

you've just been sitting there eating a

sandwich well this is actually the first

time he's heard anything okay so like

duty calls and picks up his actually

question so so I get the sense that

there is some trouble afoot and we did

speak earlier that the kids are curious

little bastards who have been like

perusing around and learning the

whereabouts of stuff I would squigly

know where Warrington month gun is no so

Warrington took his big new firearm for

a test fire out of the city so he's gone

with that so I do not have access to God

but he does not have guns in the house

where there's children he does know that

in the attic storage room there are two

kegs of something the

oh man refers to as smoke powder I'm

gonna do something with that okay so you

you sort of put the crusts of your

sandwich on the plate you just leave it

there for somebody else to clean up and

then you run up the spiral staircase to

the common room as pretty much the rest

of your action this round and you've got

okay you got a couple floors left to go

this is gonna be great

all right uh paltin you're up so I hear

the I hear Nats like alarm system going

off so I'm gonna I'm gonna head out the

door and see what's going on you see you

dragging that up to the top of the

staircase above you Oh gun and they say

which one do I shoot I thought that he

like he sees up can we can we both stop

and point and do you like the spider-man

meme yes both of us play I'm gonna I'm

gonna try shooting okay this is very I

mean I'm assuming he's like dragging her

right it's not like hearing oh yeah

clearly unwillingly dragging her by the

scruff basically I'd be easy to just aim

high

easy as someone who's never shot a gun

before so make a ranged attack just add

your dexterity bonus you're not perfect

shot it okay

do not get rid of God Dex just add your

Dex

yeah 18 all right that hits him evylyn

has never heard a gun golf before and

still no one has explained what a gun is

well you see in this you see in the

doorway Paul did launch this thing

there's a big cacao coming from the end

of this thing and the big smoke cloud

and golfing him but what I think what

happens is when she hears that even like

who is rarely scared

like falls to the ground like laughs it

is a little shocking

Alton's let me know that the first time

you got to shoot that gun at someone was

himself

[Music]

alright Jerry

yes violence hurts ourselves yeah almost

as much as it hurts we roll a d-10 for

the damage and add your dexterity okay

that's 13 all right that that deals him

a grievous wound and causes him to let

go of the girl I'm sorry it had to come

to this and we're gonna ask what

happened I have a thing that's what

happened let's see I assume your word of

recall took hand Rou as well as Simon

yeah yeah yeah they will come out and

when Simon looks up and sees Doppel

paulten his mouth just sort of hangs

open like Simon no it's it's me it's not

me it's me it's he's he's these two bit

don't don't

he doesn't know who to trust all of a

sudden I'll shoot so he just sort of

stands dumbfounded hand rue who has no

eyes knows the real palton from the fake

Paulding a and we'll just crawl back up

on top of you and give you a thumbs up

for a firearm that was that was good job

all right next up is our plaw Ryo you

hear the gunshot from up in the tower

I've hung around the sense long enough

to know what that is yes and yeah oh

well sounds like got something more of

you has to handle I have a job to do

mm-hmm no I keep making my way up to the

turret and searching around in there you

get up to the turret and you start

searching around you can see that the

place was recently refinished inside and

not a lot has been done to it other than

to sort of get the paneling on the walls

and the wall fixtures and whatnot so

there's actually not a lot of junk up

here

sift through at the moment most of

islets alliterated a few you know

blackened things that for some reason

they decided to hang on hang on to but a

thorough search of the area yields

nothing ok so there's like there's

nothing in here that it's like this is

worthless

yeah damn it and now you're trapped at

the top of this tower yeah well more if

you understands when it got into I'll

try to get out the tower and then see if

I can't just like find some sort of

escape through the rooftops yeah

absolutely there is there are windows in

the turret peak you can force one of

those open there they're a little sticky

but you go outside and now wow your your

super high up again and okay you can try

to climb out the window and clamour up

to the pointy

witch's cone hat of the tower but make a

strength athletics check to do so

alright it's fine

Mulligan that's another five you fall

ten for the record okay you take fifteen

points of damage

okay as you crash down tumble off the

second-story roof of the tower and hit

the cobblestone ground outside the

building escaped actually you know the

panic rooms on the other side of the

house so still alive though the nobody

would actually from their current

position see him fall so when you hit

the ground

my plan was blows but you have the money

yep it's all safely stored away in my

back

you can and and that is yeah you stand

up and limp away with whatever movement

I have left just right okay

are we still an initiative we are okay

so I want a flashback to DF briefly the

real DF okay if Lehr all silver hand

were to come to you back in your safe

space by the river and say that she has

secured to release and has your will

return with to you immediately your

weapons and belongings

would you given a chance join the Lord's

Alliance

she says the Lord's Alliance is a

confederacy of Free Cities Waterdeep

included that band together to help each

other in times of great and urgent need

we also share intelligence with one

another to combat common enemies your

role in the organization would be like a

field agent you wouldn't have a whole

lot to do actually but it would give you

you would carry the rank of captain in

the city watch and could leverage that

in any business you have to do in the

city henceforth

would that interest you that is an honor

in Smith it's someone like me it doesn't

really get things like that I mean I I

would I would absolutely there's nothing

more than to help but I also have I also

have so many personal obligations

she says this shouldn't interfere in any

way with your personal obligations and

if it does you've been always resign if

then yes she hands you something and you

can see that it is a shiny badge a

golden bat it's hard to see the light so

bright but a golden badge with the

Waterdeep insignia on it

she says this is your badge of office

keep it with you show it to the city

watch if ever you find yourself in need

captain Woodrow I I will thank you I

don't I don't know how to repay you

you already have you killed the Sabbath

our congratulations that helped me a

great deal

oh you're welcome

and if you want to know how I know that

we had a spy in the design of our guild

he told me everything I needed to know

does he pretend to be a Minotaur no this

one pretends to be a dwarven trap Smith

his beholder his beholder I believe

resides with you now he sure does yes

charming creature that we're keeping him

safe he's has been taken care of I could

promise you that and you can let him

know that the same I will and he'll be

gratified thank you cut - Laurie Oh

limping away from the Waffle House

coming around the corner

d/f free free from prison and fully

armed spider-man meme has DFC Laurie oh

you have just seen each other for the

first time okay initiative against

myself well you should probably roll

initiative now and we'll record that we

are already no pluriel initiative oh and

he just went oh so this is a Kiev

initiative this is a deaath initiative

yes back baby 22 all right we'll get to

him momentarily Strix uh-huh what do you

do well we're I'm still in the panic

room you are that gun has just been

fired right outside the door paulten is

standing there in a cloud and I can see

the Paulson clone all right I know you'd

have to go out into that you'd have to

go out the room to see it okay just saw

me run out and shoot someone

yes yeah all they know it could have

been that

because that's what the sound was coming

from okay well I'm just I'm just gonna

I'm gonna misty step outside the room

that's when you see at the top of the

staircase in the hall that you just

entered another paltin standing wounded

by a blast and nat running away from him

down the stairs okay well i'm she she

was dropped but she wasn't running away

okay

standing next to him on the stairs

alright I'm done with this so I'm going

to I'm gonna polymorph him as well okay

um

because I want to capture him got it i I

want to know like who like who this

person is like this is you're old enough

you rolled in that 20 on his saving

throw so he's able to resist that spell

so I just think that Paltz encounter

spelled him and I'm like why'd you do

that do what I just I just shot him and

now I just like making the confused face

of like which one is real just like

Simon you can see that the other palton

kind of moves away from NAT a little bit

toward Paul Tain's bedroom on the floor

that he's on so that puts him out of

view of just about everybody except you

paltin and you NAT and as he makes his

way to Paul tunes door there is a crash

as the window next to him shatters and

an arrow hits him basically in the chest

and it is the biggest arrow you

have ever seen it's like twice or three

times the size of a normal arrow that

has just struck him through and so he's

going to take a ton of damage holy

 it's a boy

alright and he stands there with this

honking big arrow in there now

grievously bloodied and wounded but

still alive

and what stuff and then looks through

the broken window really and next up is

DF cool well I see myself and no that's

not me

yeah I've just immediately gutter out

and like dash forward after them okay

you can close the distance you're about

30 feet away yeah I'm not using my

cutting action - this is like super fast

it mean they just like start attacking

me mm-hmm

alright you can also see that the other

you has your box uh he wouldn't actually

see that since it stashed away in his oh

right never mind yes you're right yes

yes never like grab that yep so I've

been around the block of seeing a few

doppelganger CSU simulacrum you would

also you would see his his satchel bag

that he's carrying yep and then yep

alright

cutter slash go ahead first is myself

and you've been tracking your damage so

I'll let you just attack yourself yeah

don't worry guys still deaath roll the

one Oh No so alright so that's it

alright cool nice paltin and squiggly so

I did I see him so I saw him get shot

with the giant air yes has not been

skipped if Waltons going yeah she was

skipped you want to do something yeah go

ahead

so as separate from now on after this

she'll act on evil ends turn okay um

as soon as she was dropped she is like

enraged you know she's just like fully

focused and raged and she pulls that

little dagger out from somewhere where

she had it tucked in her belt

but probably under her tunic because she

knew the Eveland wouldn't let her keep

it but deaath gave it to her so she just

flips it around and she's just trying

like almost unthinking cuz she was so

scared you know she's being like dragged

by the scruff so she just whips it out

and tries to stab the guy okay well who

sees not take out this actual dagger

he's like what the yeah and

actually because he retreated a little

bit to Paul Tain's bedroom and that

actually has to go after him with the

dagger so even more what the to

somebody'd hand a gun yeah and you

rarely hear on that like vocalize but

she's actually vocalizing like a laugh

just make a d20 roll 10 okay that does

not hit him he's able to block you hear

scream sort of and tips him off actually

he turns around confronts you and just

sort of knocks your arm away and he

still got this big-ass arrow sticking

out of him too so he's he's kind of

looking like a mess I don't think I

don't think NAT has seen much like an

arrow like that sticking out of someone

though I think she thinks that she's

seen a lot of action but she actually

hasn't so when she sees that she kind of

like she's and then she's kind of like

like real blood you know this is all

very very real and you realize just how

dangerous he must be to still be

standing after taking this humongous

bolt mm-hmm and so anyway palton and

squidly in either order so squiggly is

on his way up - yeah he could actually

run past paltin at this point so pom

just shot someone and it like mess them

up and like big fake paltin goes and

gets shot by a giant arrow yep and then

nat goes running off with a knife yeah

quickly like runs by paula is just like

be are we gonna get the cake what is

happening he bounced up the stairs up

snarky he comes around the corner of the

next flight of stairs bangs into jinx

and just keeps hopping past him

no sorry paulten what do you do so yes

okay I'm sure that's gonna be fine

whatever he is doing I'm gonna go over

to not paulten right and hmm how so how

far is he from the window five feet cops

five feet yeah which floor are we on you

are currently on the third floor facing

the front of the house and he's looking

pretty messed up yeah he's looking

pretty messed up repeat can try to kick

him out the window

yes that would be a shove action so you

have to make a strength athletics check

against his strength athletics okay

let's do it all right go ahead ooh

okay 19 okay you push him out the window

Wow I screamed this is Waffle House and

then all right out he goes he goes

flying out the broken window

conveniently broken and he just falls

down one floor landing on the second

floor balcony below you know there's a

balcony can't look out and see how he's

doing

I got it actually do me a favor and roll

a d6 that's the damage he took - okay

he is lying on the balcony alive he just

looks up and says ow

hmm buddy I forgot we added a balcony

there don't go anywhere I'll if anything

come back up I'll redo it it looks very

good from your point of view yeah okay

evylyn and matt even just goes running

after nat after she sees this tiny child

with a tiny dagger yeah running up the

stairs you can

flutter up to her and you see paltin

looking out the broken window down to

his alter ego so she sees that is fine

and I guess she'll just throw out the

window toward this dude okay when you

fly out the window make a perception

check fourteen out on the street north

of the house

you also see two deaths oh no there's

two do us a yell back at Bolton does

that change your actions in any way are

you still gonna go after Doppel palton

uh I see that he looks pretty

incapacitated right

he does look extremely hurt and lying

prone on the balcony all it's like but

which one's the real Hokage I still

don't know what that means

the other one of the DS looks pretty

hurt too

even's gonna gag continue toward the

debts okay can she reach them on this

turtle boy yeah essentially she can

reach them with her second move

so she lands right between them okay

booth what's something only death would

know uh what's the secret that I'm not

supposed to tell

sigh I'm trying to figure out how it

would play both these carrots at the

same time as you say that and it hurts

so idea if it probably say something

like no shut up rasp loriel would wait a

moment and try to read their minds yes

where you learn exactly what's in the

foremost of evil ins mind which poro

says you're supposed not telling you

what that I love Strix even hears that

and then looks it and she's like I don't

know I don't know I feel like the the

the death shut up is more genuinely Diaz

that I don't know make an inside check

leave it to chance

inside 1414 I roll Orioles deception

yeah

still rolling like a champ today

everyone that's after his bonuses 11

your instincts are probably correct the

real death would just tell you to shut

up and would be too embarrassed to say

so she she turns to like put which ones

really hurt flurry oh right yeah yeah so

she turns with death on her back and

then it's kind of like okay what's going

on

and she's like menacing the other guy

okay she's let's bring that to death

what's going on uh pluriel

will say I was just coming back from

errands and then this fake dia start

attacking me I'm already super hurt help

errands were you dealing at this point

in time Anna evil and realizes that only

one of them is carrying gutter the other

one isn't all um

sushi and only and only one of them has

well that's not true they both have that

go she says look I know you're not the

real deal and it's been a really long

day so how about you just come clean

about everything that's going on and

then we'll negotiate the terms of your

surrender and possible release otherwise

though I this swords already bloody I

might as well keep using it real Deus

behind you says like wait why is your

sword bloody and don't worry about it

why persuade him to to basically stand

down Queen okay make a persuasion check

and I'm rolling pretty bad except for

that one that 20 still 14 though so

under the circumstances pluriel your

chance to seemed of getting away from

two of them is pretty slight in your

wounded condition surrender may be your

best hope and you know based on

experience reading their minds that they

can be easily manipulated and if he

reads even if you read the Egan's mind

though he can watch her cutting that guy

in half in slow motion so as a

doppelganger when you change forms

do you just have like a backlog in their

minds that they can truly change - or do

they need like see someone no they can

just change into something else if

they've experienced if they've been in

have for him before okay poriyal will

then change into some noble that he's

our he's already used he's still wearing

the same clothes he's in but he has

changed so in reveals himself and then

plural will say I am sorry for the

deception

my name is Magnus and I've only seek to

assist you bald I was afraid that there

have been altercations at your home

after you had left so I made sure to

keep everything safe the children were

there they're okay as is your pet al

bear he is fine too and

Laurie Oh help me I do not know that

voice oh don't leave me here all my

cleans out the window emplace it's like

is that you it's here I look good that's

that's a fake paltin screaming there

right yeah just like that's him right

that's it yeah

evylyn pulls out her manacles and she's

like last chance like as in saying like

surrender to me basically flurry oh

let's say yes of course I can grit

easily show you that I mean no harm then

he puts his hands up to be manacled all

right click click okay then it is drinks

and Strix bee stingers turn Jencks you

pick up your wand as you get to the

bottom of the staircase it was thrown

away from you as you recall okay but

you're able to recover it and you have

it and you run down into the chaos that

is palton standing by a broken window

not standing not too far away shouting

out in the street and the smell of smoke

powder in the air Oh No yeah jinx jinx

ah he's just looking for the adults he's

just like where'd everyone go

does he does he find them we find CC

Strix and he sees palton but he's

obviously wary of paltin because his

last encounter with paltin did not go

well right so he'll just run behind

he'll run behind Strix like behind her

robes and be likes drinks you have to

use your magic against them they're bad

and what districts do Strix is just like

I think I still have three hit points so

I'm not in very good shape right now

so what do I say Who am I saying evil

paulsen you you can go to the window or

paulten is standing lookout and see evil

paltin shouting okay I'm gonna go to the

window and just like I see him shouting

I don't even know I don't care this is

just terrible

so I'm just going to cast a can trip

which I haven't cast before called

sacred flame okay vacation can trip and

yeah so I'm just gonna drop some green

fire just down on top of them on top

okay

evil paltin looks up and just sees a

streak of green fire raining down upon

him and says really me is it a saving

thrower as an attack role it is a

dexterity saving bro

okay then sixteen alright he rolled a 13

total so you're gonna hit there you go

okay oh great I only did seven damage

well that rain of green sacred flame is

enough to kill him yay Oh palton so a

little thrown off by like staring down

and watching him disable ganger appear

as he dies yes after when he expires you

can see that his former verts to this

sort of gray genderless bulbous eyed

alien humanoid just like gross ones like

just we're gonna we're gonna need

another stare at the episode after this

December to share any of those I look

forward seeing a lot of that stuff oh

and lots of people have asked whether

not yet super limited quality quantities

only at PacSun pluged sorry but thank

you for asking

stopping by and grabbing something try

to do a day one Oh probably disappear

that was what I was supposed to announce

is when we will all four of us will be

available when you buy merch so it's a

meet-and-greet and merch and we will

tweet the times but right now and this

is possibly a soft schedule right now we

right if there are no more announcements

the only thing we have to resolve is

does squidly blow up the house as a Nate

what did you want him to do don't look

okay yeah squiggly would probably find

the barrel this by the way is the scene

that happens after the credits roll yeah

yep does does he know what the barrels

do or how they work or he's just like

these barrels are a thing there he knows

that the smoke powder excites the hippo

man to no end and that he stuffs vast

quantities of it down his guns when he

down his gun when he wants to you know

make it explode loud okay he in an

attempt to try and like show it to the

rest of the house to be like will this

help I think he would just like try a

roll of barrel just down the stairs

so the rest of you down on the lower

floor here this would you come tumbling

down and as it comes down the stairs it

hits a wall bangs off a wall does a

little turn comes down some other stairs

90 degrees from the direction it was

going before and basically rolls right

up to NAT like to imagine everyone is
