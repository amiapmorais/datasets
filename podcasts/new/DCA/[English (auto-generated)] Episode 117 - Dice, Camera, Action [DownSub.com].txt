and we're here this is nice camera

action with all the people that you see

these are gaming professionals and we

are gonna play some dandies we're over

100 episodes and now Chris yes try don't

forget to try this at home kids

so when last we left the waffle crew

they were in the spires of the morning

confronting father Luke son bright about

his recent behavior and his efforts to

turn this temple of Lysander into a

temple of the Sun God ominous or when

over wine the father expired and burst

into flames where it was discovered that

he had been poisoned by a rare drought

oxen known as son death and as the

waffle crew or three of them anyway

struggled to conceal the evidence of

this crime

evylyn was out side basically making

good with some of the lesser priests

giving them money that she had raised to

make sure that the orphanage within the

temple was preserved am I forgetting

anything significant the poison was a

drought poison it sure was

halten was teaching Andrew how to use a

gun yeah well yes that that too a little

little side adventure with you know

severed hands using firearms oh yes for

mural slash correct another priest a

traveling priest had come to the temple

to help father son bright kind of get it

onto the onto this new course this

father Andrew cor Merrill also a Kay

father mourn and the party met him

briefly before he took his leave moments

before the death of his fellow priest at

the end of the last week's session while

they were outside of father son brights

office

d/f caught sight of an individual

leaving the temple a half-elf with sort

of a punk hairstyle who gave him a wave

and then turned invisible or teleported

away not clear which it is only a mere

minutes after that after the

disappearance of this individual that

the city watch shows up in force and it

quickly becomes apparent that the force

is led by a human captain named Tulum

Baja guar and that the city watch has

come here because they received a report

not an hour ago that there would be an

attempt on the life of a of the high

priest of the temple and so before

anyone can really sort of leave the

building or vacate the premises fifty

members of the City Guard pour in and

arrest everybody uh-oh everybody ready

now can I just like I guess escape we

weren't supposed to escape never mind we

weren't supposed to run when you say

everybody define let's see any basically

anybody who may or may not have

information or who basically put the

entire building on lockdown and then

they start separating people away and

trying to find out where the where the

what's going on they pour in behind you

to find out where to see if the high

priest needs any protection and quickly

find of course his smoking body weight

we have a sense of why they were

summoned you can ask well I'm so glad

you're here we were just about to call

you

how did you know you're so on top of

things all that you are told by one of

the counts

Stables is that the city watch received

a a missive and it indicated that an

assassination attempt would be made on

the high priest's life within the hour

oh well I guess you're a little late

it was all set perfectly yeah did

hand-drew get get handcuffed

yeah the slap the irons on hand rue for

all the good that'll do and it's then

quickly became apparent that the last

person to see the high priest alive is

is the primary suspect and all the

various under priests and whatnot who

saw the father leave the main temple

with deaath point to him I stay at D

aside as like a trusted authority figure

in the church and try to like just every

time suspicion is put on him I explained

that I've been with him I have already

questioned him he told me everything

about this poison I show them the bottle

and I just make it really clear that

he's not a suspect if I can okay I also

continue to reiterate the fact to anyone

that will listen that if we bring him

back to life with a true resurrection

that it will be fine and we can just ask

him and I'm sure that whatever power he

worships we'll be happy to explain that

or whatever these people do even also

agrees with that she's like of course

we're gonna true resurrect him I assume

that everybody understood that that

would be the correct course of action

captain hardwire says do you have a true

resurrection no ma'am

okay well then we'll get back to you

babe I'm like also backing up evylyn on

this is just like plus I mean as I'm

pointing to D F just like I mean look at

him like this man can barely hold a

dagger on his own like do you really

think

he's capable of murdering someone so

high up in the church

yeah he'll hold up her level detector

and go no I think he's pretty good at

this I'm kidding like the level detector

but I like that he's just like that that

only tells you how long he's been going

around it doesn't make him good it just

tells you how many daggers he's thrown

it doesn't right anyway they're gonna

basically they're holding out they're

holding everybody here until a

magistrate comes once word is sent that

they were too late members of the city

watch are dispatched to summon the

magistrate and until then people in the

temple are just sort of gossiping

they're crying in some cases priests and

acolytes distraught he'll be back in

just a second anyone have a true

resurrection I'm sure there's one lying

around in the storage even losers going

around asking everyone where the true

resurrections are nobody has the true

resurrection says one of the priests

except a father son bright may have been

able to resurrect people but they don't

know because he never they know he was

fairly new to the church and had never

had cause to do it uh-uh uh-huh

are we tired get worried like actually

but he does have he did have raised dead

for sure because he had enough I am NOT

two strikes from besides Paul never he's

still going on it's like come on like

look at him like every time he takes a

step he's at risk of breaking his shins

he's so feeble

he needs a sandwich does anyone have a

sandwich of the morning Lord just

watching this this like this like unfold

just rolling your eyes like okay

eventually eventually a magistrate shows

up and it is a very sort of old wizened

dwarf in a black robe you can see that

his his black robe contrasts very nicely

we

his long white beard and the the bushy

white hair growing in Tufts above his

ears although most of his head is bald

except for a little dollop of hair near

the top of his head and he confers with

the various city watchmen he takes he

has his scribe who is a young woman take

notes about what they found in the high

priests chamber then he sort of turns

his steely gray eyes toward death and

the guards come over and arrest him not

the killer I thought that we made that

real clear death is very like like does

not resist or fight back at all almost

like he's conceding or just all are

already defeated okay absolutely like

already approaching go to arrest him

they will march him away no no no and

impose guards between you and him can I

just like follow him as rats yeah you

can turn into a pile of rats and sort of

wend your way through the crowd okay

feet out the door and try to follow

they're like you shall not pass and

cheese like rats well I try to do it

where they're not looking so they don't

know it's me right I assume she sort of

goes off and then turns into rats and

then scuttles after them yeah exactly

evylyn is just kind of like just a gasp

at what's happening captain hardware

will come up to her and say say that

until this matter is reconciled I assume

that you have some means in this temple

to cast a gentle well that won't work

she says it means to basically stow the

remains or would you rather we have him

taken from the premises well he's about

to be resurrected I don't understand why

no one's working on this ID you're just

gonna leave him dead for the time being

until such time as someone can bring him

back I suppose if they deigned to

I don't suppose other temples would care

to but maybe they will if you can't well

I guess it should fall to me to take

care of his remains so I will do I know

where like a crypt or like you know you

know where you could basically put the

remains where they'd be safe yeah all

right even's kind of like the temple has

a morgue basically yeah so I think

what's starting to happen is this is

starting to sink in and you see even

kind of getting like her eyes are

starting to get wide that she kind of

realizes what actually happened because

father son bright was basically a father

figure to her because he made her and

she lived there from a very young age so

the fact that he's actually this like

charred pile of remains is starting to

seep its way in and she goes and starts

to kind of like try to figure out how to

contain these remains but is kind of

having a tough time conceptualizing what

name with them when she's when her when

that starts to dawn on her eventually

sister and sin sia comes over to you and

says I know this is deeply troubling and

that you and father sunbright have a

past together but we are expecting the

arrival any day now to last in AD Eragon

and I do believe she could probably

bring him back from the dead if she so

chooses oh good okay just a temporary

thing then I love smoking flashes just a

holding position and totally not gross

and weird and totally not father-son

right and I'll just just yeah I'll just

dissociate from that completely okay

before it before debts hauled off to far

away there's guards like blocking us

right yes okay I want to try and

persuade them be excuse me I'm the boy's

lawyer I really need to talk to him

before he's taken anywhere boy the boy

go ahead go ahead make a deception check

Oh deception okay

so that is a let's see 31 so you have

your solicitors documents excuse me now

is not the time for splitting hairs and

formalities my client is about to be

hauled off wrongfully and you are doing

a disservice to this city and you are

supporting injustice to this system

while in it you just just that a

curiosity says one of the guards why

were you with your client in the temple

to help him atone for the crimes he's

already served time again already served

his time for at this point of lieutenant

comes over sort of interested in this

mounting conversation and he's just sort

of nods and stroking his beard yeah yeah

this is all good information and he says

so what where is your where is your

practice sir so it's still kind of in

startup we don't have like a physical

location it's just sort of where I I

have means of contact so it's wherever

I'm needed my practice is where the

people need me well you can come along

with us and after we get him processed

you can speak to him

and they'll serve this sort of gently

kind of take you know put their hands on

your shoulders and back and usher you

along with them again don't you don't

need to touch I can I can walk I'm good

okay so Paulson will follow within that

with another group of guards also turn

into one rat okay like a bunch so it's

way less conspicuous and kind of just

like either jump on paltin or Diaz

shoulder whoever she is right that would

be conspicuous I mean a rat on

somebody's shoulder is not something

never mind she'll just stay on the

ground okay like a rat jumps on Paul and

he's just like ah okay am i close enough

to so like is there still like a

separation between me and EF yeah damn

how many guards are there you've now got

your own retinue of four guards and des

got a retinue of eight guards hmm and it

looks like they're just taking him from

the temple on foot somewhere there's no

like paddy wagon or anything okay so how

many freaking I had a thing for this I

swear so if I'm not mistaken mass

suggestion works on up to 12

does it not supposed to do bad things to

them illegal spells up to 12 creatures

can be affected by am a suggestion why

would it be illegal to use a spell that

completely shaved people to your will I

just castile it's nothing crazy it's

just like uh excuse me can you you guys

can stick around just can you give me

two minutes with the boy we just need to

talk about what he can and cannot see

all right this is a this is easily done

with a drop of sweet oil in a verbal

come

opponent but a bing bada boom saving

throws he all right

each target so 12 targets must make

saving throws and all this before all

fail hopefully where are we go

oops that's a d12 okay and what's the DC

there Talton 17 and there we go

so you cast the spell and then your

words are you know you just want to just

give us a couple minutes alone guys is

that them hmm

they suggest then like within wit didn't

seem right okay like they can see that's

fine

all right they all comply thank you

gentlemen

this is yep killing second alright so I

got this far what do you got what you

obviously have a plan because you just

complied with being arrested for a

murder that you did not commit so I'm

assuming there's more to this than a

little all I could do is tell

the truth

date doesn't understand no but like how

will you persuade them that the truth is

real because they won't believe you I I

don't know all right well speaking as

your lawyer all right this is terrible I

I think it would be best that until you

were actually being threatened with

execution you should probably just stay

quiet and yeah

that us we'll figure something out okay

so just just stall don't don't tell them

what they want to hear but also hold off

on the truth mainly because it will

sound like a lie but but no I mean I'm

not a liar yeah I know you're I know I

know you're not a liar but the thing is

they don't and I feel like they're

probably half expecting you to say oh I

didn't kill him and they're gonna be

like ok we'll we'll kill you and find

out or something I don't know just it's

just like just like hold tight mmm um

just you know if they bring you in and

you know there's a there's a bigger

fella in the cell to just like be really

nice to him but not too nice you know I

mean unless you want to make a really

good friend like that's that's fine just

just what do you need what do you need

you're probably creeping over at this

point can overhear this conversation

yeah I've been listening to it debating

on whether how to bite palton mm-hmm

I see her and I'm just like I'm you said

many rats not one rat so much to me it's

just before I don't think I don't think

I have this one's got a little witch hat

yeah this one has a tiny which had well

most Rick's would probably like that

I don't though the rat facepalms

it's like look we're gonna figure this

out I do think that we should have

listened to me because now you're being

arrested again but what what what what

do you need what can we do what's

something from the outside that you need

any like smokes or something that you

need us to bring in like just be

observant be perceptive listen and look

at everyone around you around what is

this a suspect we know it's not me and

the only other thing I could need is

just don't do

you think foolish that we'll get any of

you in the same situation as me okay

looks at all the guards waiting okay

well I'll be okay I'm telling you man

you're making it way harder for you to

become Hokage but I still believe in ya

I still know what that means that's fine

I look to the guards like alright we're

good alright they will again take you

both to what is what you ultimately

believe is a courthouse there is one

actually not too very far only a couple

blocks away from the spires of the

morning and they march you into this

Grand Castle Ward edifice made of stone

paltin you are taken upstairs so they

can record your information about who

you are and what your business is and

they will take ya downstairs to the jail

the way you say it's a jail yes olan

jail so it is in the basement of this

courthouse there you're assured through

a door there's a waiting area you sort

of pass through that you pass by a

staircase leading upstairs and then

you're taken to a cellblock and in that

cell block are a number of iron doors

that basically behind which are stone

cells and one of the doors is opened you

can see that the door itself is solid

iron it's got a small window with bars

in it and a plate over it that can be

opened and closed from the outside

and so you are marched into a cell that

is yours and yours alone

it's ten feet deep and five feet wide

okay as soon as the earth has put into

that cell okay

they locked up behind um he basically

has an immediate mental breakdown falls

to his knees hands shaking like just

touching the walls around them and then

like really retracting him back into his

body and just shaking and sobbing strix

ratifies followed if they haven't

stepped on her so you're trying to

follow him into the cell yeah make a

stealth check what I'm already at do I

get retinol I don't get rap bonus well

as a rat oh yeah do I get any innate

stealth yeah I'm just looking rap friend

rat friend nope no innate stealth okay

well that's a non lemon okay so they

realize that that a rat has crept into

their cellar and they try to kill you I

have a witch hat that's true you are a

rat in a witch hat that is a little

suspicious let me just make our insight

check here okay a one of the okay one of

the guards actually seeing your little

witch hat says oh oh yeah hey Gary don't

don't don't Gary don't Gary don't attack

the rat hang on hey rat can you talk

freakin Gary freaking look I look I look

back and I'm like yeah it's a rat killer

turn back into myself okay

my friend who's your friend uh my friend

EF he's in there he's looks really sad I

just want to make sure he was okay oh

wait you're one of the people from the

temple what no I mean no I know I don't

believe in Lysander I was never I'm not

a temple person were you trying to break

him out of jail no I was just trying to

give him snacks I didn't want him to go

hungry make a persuasion check this is

100% the truth by the way oh yeah that's

nice persuasion not deception okay

that's 18 oh wait no it's more hold on

18 oh no what is 18 I'm sorry yeah 18

yeah show her out Gary okay you're

you're sort of pushed out into the

street by my city guardsmen gary who

then locks the cell the outside door

behind him and sits just before she's

leaving she's like don't worry I'll

bring you some pies in a min it's fine

please don't cry

d/f cries yeah do I do I see streaks

getting escorted like out the window is

that in view you're upstairs standing by

a desk with a clerk who's taking down

your name your office information and

and and whatnot make a perception check

okay as I'm telling us just like yeah

that's Fault in SEPA of step and SEPA

law practice mm-hmm hey you said

perception yes cool 9 yeah you don't see

or hear strix through the window of the

office that's impressive because she's

loud yes yes okay and then they tell you

to sit in the waiting area and the time

will be arranged for you to speak to

your client fantastic

and then then begins the next two of the

worst hours of Paul Tain's life ever oh

my god where he's just sitting in a

waiting room talking and people are just

talking to him meanwhile at the temple

Anna Evelyn has and the other priests

have made sure

that all the information that needs to

get out about father-son bright is

disseminated that the father's remains

are put in the morgue behind lock and

key where they can be safeguarded until

they can be raised efforts will be made

to send priests out to other affiliated

good aligned temples to see if anyone

there has a true resurrection to bring

him back to life

great that sounds wonderful even says a

little like blessing actually kind of

closes up father-son Bright's remains in

word there's a there's a captain of the

guard who wants to talk to you says

sister incense iya oh great I'll tell

him that death was not the murder and he

should get him out of jail let's go

you are met by a human woman dressed in

the captain's uniform you can see that

she's got a helm talked under her arm as

she's talking to some underlings and

sending them off and then she turns to

you abruptly looks you up and down and

says what can you tell me about the

theft that occurred here about a week

ago two weeks ago ah it was a statue was

that the report oh that statue well it

was not so much a theft as it was a

failed theft that turned into kind of a

kidnapping and vandalism I would say and

this was perpetrated by and she leans in

to one of the constables and then she

looks back to you I'm sorry it was

perpetrated by whom those thanoth are XA

and ya she says and

have there any any other incidents here

at the temple involving the zenith or

the guild well there was the thing where

they put some sort of explosives all up

under the temple but that was never

clear whether they did that or just said

they did that and it was somehow

involved in the theft because they

wanted to get everybody out so you

believe that they were responsible for

the false bomb threat yeah well we have

some reason to believe that they might

be involved in this assassination oh why

because of the nature of the information

we received that brought us here what

was it like was it written like a like a

beholder would write it I'll beholder

how do be holders right a beholder yeah

like the zanaffar

as an authority holder well yeah listen

come on captain Mary I thought that I

mean I thought that was common knowledge

interesting she says and are you going

to remain at the temple well I was about

to go find the suspect y'all took away

because he's the wrong guy

well magistrate level stone is now

overseeing the case your friend his fate

is in his hands now well I guess I'll

have to talk to him cuz I don't know why

you take something away without even

trying to zone and truth him I thought

that was pretty standard practice she

says magic can be used to ascertain

truth and a neutral party will be

responsible for such magic should

magistrate level stone demon necessary

it is it is the magistrate's discretion

and where is magistrate level zone now

he presides over a court house near here

about two blocks away even takes like

directions there and she's like well

thank you very much I appreciate that if

there's anything else I can tell you

about that

terrorists start robbery kidnapping

vandalism you know it was all bad but

I'm happy to help but I don't think you

need to worry about that Zanna thar cuz

we demolished him she nods there's

something in her bearing that suggests

that while she's taking all in

information she's passing no real

judgement over its truth or lack thereof

you think she's just basically doing her

job she has no personal investment in

this thank you for your service

and she will leave with her cadre as so

evil and are you gonna head to the

courthouse then yeah then you see paltin

city in the waiting-room stretch like

slowly going that yes oh okay good my

partner is here of SEPA and SEPA law we

we start a law firm by the way my she

will be able to also assist in the

matter at hand as we are mister woodrose

attorneys isn't that right well I don't

know I mean coming from the church how

would I know truth when I heard it you

like who looks at her and then looks at

the people talking she's up she's very

shaken up over the events that

transpired much much weaker stomach

toward death of course she's but I can

you can rest assured she is very good at

what she does right I am very good at

what I do yes great so so I'm glad that

you're handling all these administrative

tasks I'll just get to talking to the

client by now Strix so you would have

been outside probably pouting on a curb

somewhere okay Paul's like biting his

lips with the paperwork yeah you so evil

then there is a desk with a clerk behind

it that you can approach and talk to you

personally

she goes up to the clerk and is like hi

I'm uh I'm Yvonne maher zain duly

appointed paladin of the morning Lord

come here from the spires to speak to

prisoner da Woodruff yes she writes her

name down and she asks you some

follow-up questions about your

affiliation with the temple and any

other affiliations you might have she

asks you if you know that young man

seated over there pointing to politics

yes who is also requested to see this

same yes but that's fine he can handle

what he's handling not I'll go in on

both of our behalf she takes her name

down and then hands you a slip of paper

and says have a seat a seat why okay

well while I'm waiting I'd also like to

talk to magistrate level stone stone oh

oh she writes something down the other

paper and she says well have a seat and

I will see when he is available next is

there anything I could do to try and see

him just a smidge Superman I'm kinda in

a big hurry persuade okay go ahead oh my

god I'm pretty sure I've heard you talk

to like Amazon on the phone like that

you have heard that 17 she says well

maybe I can catch him before he gets too

involved in his current business just

have a seat I'll be back engines roar

I'm and she's like thank you so much

I'll do what I can even goes and sits a

chair away from politics just like this

big portly dwarf comes over and sits

between you he's just kind of like

leaning over in like talking pass the

puts his arms up and this like wave of

Bo just sort of washes over the area

just like all right look I'm sorry for

what I said about the whole church thing

but our friend our clients life is at

stake here and now it's not really the

time to be said to be playing this petty

game and I could both could really

really work together on this and it

would go really well just a man set a

Maxis a croc comes in sits across from

you he doesn't go to that he sees that

nobody's at the desk right now it's just

sort of kind of takes off his gloves and

puts them away just tucks them in his

jacket looks around sits down across

from you and then becomes sort of

instantly aware of the tension between

you two he's just he's just that he's

just sort of a mustachioed man with a

brown bowler hat and sort of a shoddy

looking cake even smiles graciously at

him the way that you do when you like

welcome someone new to a waiting room

yes exactly

yeah well turns and just he'll tip his

hat he'll tip his hat to you because

you're a beautiful wonderful looking

what wonderful spirited person he can

tell right away Paul just gives like a

little like look I'm saying that if you

go in to talk to whoever it is you said

we both should go in there you're saying

you want to come with yes

that's literally what I'm saying I mean

are you sure you want to hang out with

someone like me from the church

it's like I find my cave find my cave

buy my cave I mean my cave if I'm in my

happy cave the dwarfs like yes I like

caves outside of guys building to shake

well the chicken you know make a clap of

sort of eruption of the the broom as it

backfires can certainly be heard

throughout the waiting room okay that's

what she's gonna do boom so you guys

will hear that outside except deep

wallet followed by a slowly going away

scream wait was strikes here I don't

think so I didn't see her where strikes

going she's going to the black staff

tower again okay she's gonna go there

and knock on the door okay she's gonna

say as a fellow magic user like bang

bang waiting help my friend is been

falsely accused of murder and we're

trying to help this city and help all

the people in here we kill the zenith

are now and everything is going bad and

we need help

the raven knocker just stares back at

you and actually you see its eyes move

like a little bit with sort of a compute

a confused doesn't know what to do kind

of stare isn't there anybody in this

stupid city that does good figs I yell

extremely loud and proud of is that

anyone here nice and kind will help

people when they need it the door opens

to black staff tower and you see a

figure standing behind that door and

just sort of you see this dark staff

come out hook you around the neck and

pull you in and then the door slams shut

well that's what you get when you're

persistent kids I apply for a job and I

was accepted DF you can hear just

occasionally guard footfalls moving

through the cell block through the

tiniest of cracks underneath your door

the the other cells are sort of spaced

apart and have large walls of Earth and

stone between them so you can't hear if

there's any other prisoners trapped with

you but other than that sliver of light

coming in around the door there's really

no light whatsoever in your cell at the

moment sure isn't

the window to your cell door opens and a

guard peers in and just says the

magistrate is moving your case up you'll

be you'll be out of here in an hour okay

do you require any water so so Diaz is

basically in the complete back of his

cell mm-hmm just like hunched up into a

ball yeah there's like a little square

of light on his feet basically yeah

so it's like so when he asked for water

you see like do you ask you like a

really quick rush like nod all right

the hatch will close evylyn the clerk

comes out leans in and whispers to you

the magistrate will see you privately

now thank you so much up privately or

can I bring my partner he's a silent

partner she looks at him meaningfully

make another persuasion check because

the the clerk was under the impression

you were going alone when he ate oh yes

yes if you like that should be fine and

he'll this she will usher you into the

magistrate's office which is down a hall

when you enter the office you can see

Virant our level stone this dwarf in a

black robe behind a desk writing and you

can also see the scribe but she doesn't

wait she doesn't stick around long she

goes into a small side room and she

takes some signed papers let the

magistrate has just signed you can see

that there is a guard standing in each

of the far corners of the room

impassively

watching as

enter what would be the proper like

etiquette for approaching a magistrate

for a paladin so generally speaking the

black robes as they are known are they

they vary wildly some of them are pretty

informal others very much formal if you

wanted to be cautious with with one of

these guys then you could refer to them

as simply magistrate or judge she she

approaches and curtsies yep

magistrate thank you for seeing me on

such short notice I appreciate it I've

just come from the temple where

unfortunately things are quite a bit

confused you have my friend death would

row in your jail and he is wrongfully

accused I know that you'll you know be

willing to put him under his own of

truth and see that he's telling the

truth and and let him go right away I

just figured I should tell you myself

and palton you're just keeping silent

like yes what my partner here said our

client has been taken in wrongfully and

that is very very alarming the

magistrate says in looking at the body

it appears that it had been just

disturbed just as in mentally the crime

scene had been altered well I assume

that when he saw what happened he

probably tried to put out the fire that

was coming from inside the person I see

that was that was that was the purpose

of covering him with the raga I mean

that's what I would do right because who

in their right mind would think that

hiding a body under a rug would be a

good idea if I saw somebody burning I

would try to smother the flames mm-hmm

exactly for extinguishing purposes and

none other there also appears

have been a missing bottle of wine not

accounted for was that taken

well we have no knowledge on this but it

can be the one that he drank that made

him turn on fire that was poison no

there was another one we saw that bottle

even looks at Paulson like seriously

it's like silent partner if if a zone of

truth were to be cast here in the

present company of you and My gods

would I then we had that alas attained

what became of said bottle of wine sir a

life was taken when you're concerned

over a bottle of wine he's very thorough

and good at his job

well I can see when I'm not needed yes I

am well and truly aware that this is not

necessarily clear-cut case however I

have enough evidence now to bring this

to trial and so I wash out this will be

dealt with before nightfall I promise

you I can cast his own truth on death

right now you can go see that he's

telling the truth that would not be

proper as you have a relationship with

him and you are his friend well why are

you bringing him to trial if you know

that he is telling the truth he says

because this is not the first criminal

incident that he has been involved with

to my knowledge what

what do you mean well this has no direct

bearing on the case it has been brought

to my attention that he is guilty of the

crime of the murder of many Dwarfs the

unleashing of the fire primordial mogera

the Don Titan which is wrought havoc

across the North lolis past several

months

you must haven't confused us someone

else dear don't ever do something like

that

it has already been confirmed moreover I

have a witness in custody who will

testify that he is the leader of a

criminal organization operating within

the confines of this city a criminal

organization do I look like a criminal

because I'm part of his organization he

looks at the guards and says take her

into custody put her in the jail cell

excuse me

the two guards will try to remove you by

force you are a terrible magistrate you

don't listen at all I have doubts about

your mental acuity hampering justice is

a fine of 200 gold and hardly but for a

tenday I'm not hitting justice can i

already persuade him by like saying a

whole bunch of legal and Paladini

mumbo-jumbo sure make good at

disadvantage disadvantage it's a dirty

20 okay he says I admire your spirit

young lady you're a good friend your

criminal underboss and he says I don't

want to make this any worse feel that

necessary and I appreciate all that you

do for the city at your church so if you

leave now and do not disgrace yourself

any further I will make sure that these

charges do not stand against you

thank you for your time I very much

appreciated she's looking out importance

like just in the waiting room that night

doesn't even look up Oh bad call brother

she walks up okay

she storms off he's like I guess we were

due for a character re-roll at some

point even as you barge out of the

building you bang shoulders with

somebody coming in in a moment you sort

of turned to face each other I'd like

you to make a perception check nine okay

it's it's just sort of a frumpy short

man with sort of badly parted hair and

mustache and beard with a valise and he

drops his release and picks it up and

apologizes to you profusely oh no my I'm

sorry I was very clumsy I should have

been watching I'm going my apologies and

he goes inside strides past palton

palton you see him introduce himself to

the clerk as front a burn Ecker

solicitor

and name is taken down and then he he's

asked to sit and he he sits a little

ways down from you and just sort of

opens his beliefs and shuffles around

some papers he also mentions that he is

representing ought steel toes must be

somebody else who's imprisoned here

hmm and you are now you are now alone

with the smelly dwarf this friend

emmenecker dude and the guy in the

bowler hat ah

a fellow practicer of the law fantastic

[Laughter]

how do you do my fellow lawyer he looks

at you and says he sort of looks at you

and eyes narrow a little bit like he's

trying to figure out if he knows you you

know from various circles or private

clubs or whatnot and then he says I I'm

uh I'm doing good very good

you Oh got a you know just here on

behalf of my client as well

gotta in a little bit of a little bit of

a pickle you know how that goes mm-hmm

yeah so uh what's yours in for I may ask

um no you may not

my of course that information is

privileged sir like of course that was a

test I was making sure you knew the the

proper etiquette of sharing price hello

her clients uh stuff the dwarf turns to

you and says will you represent me

what'd you do I punched a guy did he

deserve it oh yes it was with

justification we should talk well I'll

catch up to you later okay all right the

another clerk comes out or the clerk

leaves and returns and then takes mr.

ever Necker downstairs to meet his

client

and he turns to you and he says I wish

you and your client well yeah likewise

good sir it was a pleasure

yep Strickland Oaks her head in the

waiting room like are you coming or not

oh yeah pollen gets up he's like you'll

accept the dwarf yep he's just like when

you get a chance you you just look up

SEPA and sepahan law okay he makes a

mental note of that and nods gratitude

and that's it

alright strix you are in the black staff

tower and you are talking to a woman in

a housecoat okay that looks like it's

seen a fair amount of use but it's it's

a she's not badly dressed she's just you

caught her at an awkward time and you

can see that she is dark of skin dark

hair to her shoulders very curly and she

has got a big tall black staff in her

hand with a hook at the top the staff

sort of naturally kind of bulges near

its tip and then there's sort of like

almost like it's got like it almost like

a beak all right and I met vajra in cult

is this for sure this is her yes okay as

sure as you know thing as you adjust

your new surroundings

you see it is her and she's screaming in

the street is not the answer to your

problems I just I look at her and I say

that's fair that's a fair assessment

thank you

next time I will softly scream in the

streets this is a big Tower it took me a

while to get downstairs WoW is there

stairs all the way up I want to see no

there's not stairs all the way up why

why why are you here said something

about your friend is in trouble my

friend my so this is is this the drunk

no no it's not the drunk one so my

friend T is not the holier-than-thou one

no it's not that one it's it's the other

one

but the Rogi looking one with the stabby

knives and maybe maybe not like just I

don't know he's got problems oh yeah no

I like him yeah okay

he has been falsely accused of the

murder of father son right what towel

yeah we work okay you catch her up on

all the latest news and what she what's

now you're basically in her study today

I'm sitting in a padded chair across

from her as you finish your story all

right I annoyed her all the way I'm just

like wow there's not stairs I just keep

pointing out things about and like lore

about black staff tower that I have like

red and like handouts like me like an

unseen servant will bring a drink to you

and she says would you like a sedative

in that no those don't work well with me

because if I'm sedated I might die this

is it's just an herbal tonic it's not

gonna kill you uh she she she just

thinks well if the black staff tells me

maybe it'll make me a black staff okay

okay and you get something stronger and

then she says okay well your friend is

in the hands of the judicial system so

why don't we see how that plays out

maybe this will work to his advantage

and he'll just get off the hook okay

what that's not how it works what do you

get he's also really scared of cages so

he's probably curled into a ball right

now I'm crying and that makes me sad

well that is that it is sad and that

shouldn't be happening cuz it's not his

fault like we've done good for this city

we killed the zenith are we we we've

done we've we've saved children we've

saved owl bears we just like maybe

fireball too many things but you know

it's just it's fine well the way that

the mass Lords have set up our

government they basically have these

individuals these magistrates who uphold

the law but have a great deal of

autonomy about how they enforce it and

they are trusted water davian's

judicious in their application of the

code legal and so if a if a magistrate

were

corrupt he or she would not last long in

this system that is true that's that's

good to know do you do you think that if

the time comes and if they do say that

he did it falsely is there can you lend

your word that he's a good person and I

he's innocent

I don't know him so no what if I give

you a snack I won't eat it and it will

still be now but she says don't worry

I'm sure that you know Strix is tearing

up and holding the snack okay just like

she says who is who is the magistrate do

you know he's a dwarf mm-hmm I don't

remember his name

okay that's all right that's all right

but do you present I don't think he has

a really good reputation with dwarves

house he'll hold on feathers is

attacking my cat we'll get back to Strix

in a moment yeah

Evelyn and palton your outside mmm I

swear to God I swear to God my bird

attacks my cat he's so crazy

that is crazy Paul Paul Denis Boleyn

were with you now hmm

I guess evylyn is trying to figure out I

I thought I heard Strix out here you

thought you heard that too right yeah or

Strix like noises definitely high

probability you know there was a rap in

a witch hat that I had never seen before

come to think of it cuz I think is I've

seen her be many rats without witch hats

I've never seen one with I would say

that probably a witch hat on a rat is a

pretty good indicator this tricks

husband involved

there's a good probability aside from

that though can't really say I see any

reason she let me could have been her

well what should we do now well so the

app is going to trial right justice

anymore

right well I mean we are the boys

lawyers so if he's going to trial he

needs representation does he not do you

actually know how to lawyer I know how

to talk to people I don't think that's

all you need to be a lawyer pretty sure

that's all there is to being a lawyer

that's like saying all you need to be a

pal is to hit stuff which is absolutely

not the case

oh you saw even started to be like eggs

yeah mm-hmm

think no no no cuz paladin's have have

many jobs mm-hmm lawyers only job is to

get someone to believe something yeah I

can do that so we can try to represent

him in court or wait to see how they try

him or break him out which I feel like

will cause real reason to get arrested

even quotes like hmm all right lawyer

boy what is order two of the water

Davian penal code I'll follow that with

this why is order two of the Penal Code

and he tries not to laugh

are you are you swirling an imaginary

glass of wine right no I'm I am I am

illustrating my thoughts

I hate that you're convincing what you

are mmm

that strickland 13%

oh I was gonna say Strix the the black

staff says look if I or you or any

member of the watchful order of mages

and protectors tries to meddle in the

case of a magistrate that's going to

undermine the entire government system I

understand that and I mention that I'm

from sigil and the government system

scares me a little bit well that

explains a lot and to with with the way

thing things are just set up differently

here all right is there any way we can

at least like request that because of

his mental state he not be kept in a

cage so what what is the nature of this

this fear of small dark places I have no

idea he hasn't told us because he

doesn't like to communicate but I feel

like it's very detrimental to his health

well then I suppose I would recommend

that you go to the courthouse and just

tell the clerk's there that your friend

has claustrophobia oh all right and

perhaps they can arrange to have him

kept in another place this is what your

the black staff cuz you're real smart

coming up with these great solutions to

crushing scary trauma the squeezy rats

ask for what do you want can we be

friends Vajra you see you're the worst

pregnant pause yeah she just sort of she

just sort of stairs then she sort of

gets lost in a painting on a wall for a

second and then and the painting sort of

winks back to her like a like cupcake

exactly

and she says in time we might be good

friends

ah that's good enough for me I'm gonna

go ask them to see if the it's

claustrophobia can put them in some

place that's less terrible and then

we'll just listen to the law because the

black staff told me to okay good luck

and she'll see you out no Strix we'll

just use it we'll find a window with

their broom hope you like

good bye new friend I see thank you

then what happens is you crash into a

window that just refuses to open and

then I fall on the ground and she has to

leave me out yes

okay then I'm like goodbye a new friend

and the door closed that you turn and

the door is like already shut behind you

Ravens just like glaring yes ok well

then I will post haste go to the

magistrate and I don't care if anyone's

in line or whatever I go in just like

yelling and I'm like oh wow ok so you

head back deaath your cell door opens

again the water is brought to you you

hear a conversation with the guards

outside who a couple of them seemed

genuinely concerned about you and your

present mental state but then it fades

and you're kind of left in the dark with

your class of water alright

[Music]

yeah I've educated like take strings

from it never you can to help you know

when you get real sad and crying it that

we're like lump in your throat so using

best try to like clear the lump yeah and

then you hear a whisper under your door

and it says hey do you know you're gonna

die in a prison somewhere

okay cool niggath goes from like hunched

up like this yeah and then just kind of

like falls forward like kind of like

pressing his head down to like the

inside of his elbows if you think this

is a dark cramped so this is say it

again I could hear you what he says if

you think this cell is dark and cramped

wait do you see the ones under CASL

water deep great through through through

like a very distressed teary voice yeah

whole like how look at the door and just

say who's there who's saying that you

hear nothing and then the shadow sort of

under the door leaves

yeah as he's leaving again you can look

a perception check or to see if you can

ascertain anything familiar about the

hushed voice it was obviously somebody

speaking in a lower voice than they're

accustomed to I got a good roll six you

recognize the voices belonging to the

Zent assassin or still flock 'some just

someone I hadn't met previously yeah he

was you met him at chair con you

detained him outside his coach as he was

attempting to free dad you

also saw him briefly in the Zanna thar's

lair before you allowed him to flee fool

me once shame on me oh wait twice show

me you fool me three times

I could hanged not too long after he

leaves the door opens and a couple

guards come in to help you out and

they're very gentle with you actually

and that's good because yeah if is like

really really fragile and malleable

right yeah and as they lead you out Todd

shows up and says he'll take you up to

the courtroom oh good really your face

yeah and he the other guards are they

don't he's basically gonna take full

custody of you the other guards are

slightly concerned but Todd says oh no

it's all right this has been this has

been cleared by the magistrate and then

once he hi yeah and then once he as he

leads you upstairs you can see Todd is

in his typical way sort of unassuming

he's not manhandling you or anything

he's just kind of staying a pace and a

half behind you and sort of directing

you on where to go and then half way up

the stairs he says so what kind of stuff

does evylyn like i like manic cold or in

yeah you've got you've got shackles on

right behind your back okay so I'm

feeling great

so as he's walking he assets just kind

of stop turns back toward the place and

then kiss keeps walking like he's trying

to give him a face like right now dude

[Laughter]

yeah he says you know I I don't I don't

know why I asked that I just couldn't

think of a better time

gif says Dias actually say even when

likes righteous people the truth justice

she likes what is right she likes those

that are good and haven't I haven't ever

done bad things yeah but like what's her

favorite flower

it's Morning Glory

also shut up okay

he leads you into the courtroom you can

see that there is the magistrates bench

up front there is a bench facing it

where Todd takes you and just sort of

parks you behind it and you're just

basically standing in this pulpit facing

the magistrate who isn't present yet but

whose arrival Oh seems imminent behind

you your back is to them our benches

like pews where people can sit witnesses

or whatever can just sit and watch

what's transpiring at the moment the

only person is sitting in the back pew

and it's a sort of an unassuming

mustachioed man with a bowler hat okay

and then the old dwarf is brought out

under escort and sits behind his chair

and he looks up and he says I thought

you had solicitors representing you did

they he says find the clerk see if

they're in the waiting room drinks is in

the waiting room isn't she yeah we are

also just outside like we never win

anywhere from just having a frickin girl

right outside yeah well they're not

checking outside figuring if we should

still try to represent I like the idea

that evil and paltin just quarrel their

way through these trial

[Laughter]

oh wait the magistrate says well

let's get on with it well so the clerk

comes out Strix just looks around the

waiting room it sees you but doesn't see

what they're looking for and then turns

around does he hear me yeah like

stalking on being like we need to get my

friend did the better sell so he doesn't

want to die uh yeah they might overhear

that and the clerk will say DF are you

talking about it's like whips our head

around to where like her hat like half

flies on she's like yes are you family

ah complicated let's just say yes well

let's just say the truth

are you we choose our family so yes the

the clerk make a percept make a

persuasion check

well his trial has just started trial I

I'm gonna yell I yell that really loud

so hopefully evil and impulse in here

that no they won't we roll perception no

you can't hear anything that goes on in

the courthouse when the doors closed

it's completely sealed I got all 11 good

okay she says I have a seat

I don't want to hurt it have a seat I'm

not going to sit I'm going to go to his

trial oh no you're not

why not because because of this what

because of what do you do

like because I look like a trash person

like what's happening nights it's not my

fault the clerk says to the to one of

the guards this woman is clearly crazy

take her out

oh no no I'm not sure I'm een actually

that's I am crazy but it's for a good

reason but Kimmy I just sit in the trial

because I I i she just starts crying the

clerk says no I don't think so

take her out no please don't take me so

palton and evylyn you see two guards

basically pulling strix out by her feet

while she's like grabbing door frames

and clawing across the floor and then

they just sort of push her out and like

they used their boot to press her face

out the door it's it's clear she's just

mad so yeah

phone's me like don't say anything don't

say anything I'm gonna like ask the

guards escorting and be like well what's

happening here they just say that she

came into the courtroom and started

ranting and raving and not following the

clerk's instructions so maybe she's you

know strict strict looks at politics

like dance trial is starting right now

they won't let the end it's like oh the

trial starting well isn't that just

fantastically played out otherwise we

would have missed it for we are the day

let's just let's just go in you just

leave strikes that's like getting a boot

just like strikes me be like whatever it

is that troubles you fair woman which

was like I'm really sorry

their way and easier so love whatever it

makes the motion for like and that opens

up a pouch in her cloak oh okay well

be like oh yes I must go home to my

dumpster okay ones pocket alright so

then you go back and scoop her up as

paltin goes into the building and yeah

then I call up Alton okay yes and you

sort of I'm just gonna try to attend the

trial okay

d/f magistrates sits before you looks at

his paperwork then gives you sort of a

steely gaze and he says do you it ro you

are trouble with a capital T and he says

you were the last to be seen in the

company of father son bright that you

claim not to have committed the deed

yourself do you know who did if not you

it was not me

nor do I know exactly who I can only

provide you what I do know and is much

knowledge and observations as I can to

help you ascertain the true culprit am I

in there yet

not yet go on well before I entered the

room with father son bright another man

had was also in the room and left so

that's also someone that you should

possibly consider this is any rifle sir

some papers

father Andrew Camaro Carmel Camaro

whatever that's that's right he was in

there when I he was in that room as

father son body and I entered

and after brief pleasantries he exited

the room that was the last person to be

a son without other son right before me

he reported that there weren't that

pleasantries were wasn't the word he

used i pleasantries was I suppose a

misnomer there in exchange of words I

would like you to speak truthfully to me

and not lie I wasn't but Andrew Andrew

Corr Merrill and I certainly didn't get

on get off on the right foot there was a

lot of tension between us he spoke of

the tension between you and father son

right

he is also correct well you seemed to

have a lot of tension in your life is

there anyone with whom you deal with

that you don't have tension yes plenty

thank you

well that's proof all I need thank you

and next question are you aware of a man

named oh sorry a dwarf named art steel

toes I don't think I don't think I do

ah so that is a no you can make an

insight check if you like yeah yo super

hi thank you you dimly recall chosen

you're a good draw friend mmm maybe

throwing that name out at one point

while you are down in MS an authority

can't exactly recall under what

circumstances but it's not an unfamiliar

name to you it's just not something

somebody that you know and okay no well

so I recall the name but I've never

actually met him bring in the witness

please and one of the guards leaves and

returns with a man who looks like a

solicitor kind of a little unkempt

frumpy fellow who you recognized as the

solicitor for one pernicious harp hell

mm-hmm same one representing her and

accompanying him is a disheveled little

dwarf

simpleton with a beholder beanie on Oh

sort of clutching the beanie in his

hands actually do as he enters and the

the magistrate puts on his spectacles

and looks at this wretched little dwarf

fellow and says how are you ought steel

toes oh yeah I might steal toes and you

were in the service of the zenith on

there

told me a long time yeah and can you

point to the zenith are in this

courtroom and art points to you

DF ah he says Anitha he runs everything

there oh yeah

Alton still begging just can't please

get in here and represent my client yes

but you cut to seeing of palton evil and

moving forcefully down a corridor does

not mean just like determinately down

down to get fight trying to figure out

we're like oh yes one door nope that's

the clerk's office open up another door

nope that's a records room on your way

to every every single door he like goes

into he preemptively just like barges in

goes object nope not this one can it be

one of these and the zennith who was

responsible you say for the theft of

property at the same temple where father

sunbright was murdered only weeks later

oh yeah I guess so yeah he was after

statue yes I'm aware

you're anything just say as at that

point in time paltin voice I object

this courthouse is much larger on the

inside that is fantastic architecture

I'm very sorry I'm late I am the boy's

representative I am his attorney

Alton SEPA of SEPA and SEPA at law why'd

that happens you start to glow paltin

hmm recognize this globe okay

go ahead and make an insight check okay

huh interesting

okay um this is this is an odd thing

that has never happened to me before

okay

[Music]

evylyn is like there's a sort of a

stunned silence and you can see that

ever Necker just kind of looks at palton

solicitor - solicitor and then just sort

of casts his eyes down to the floor well

the globe is real and I'm here to

represent my client yet Woodrow would

someone like to fill me in even just

like as he barged in with objection your

honor even came in behind him but just

did the like against the wall like like

trying to be out of the frame just

sidled away yeah she's just trying to be

like in a corner somewhere unobtrusively

like not interfering not doing anything

just watching like I apologize for

disturbing the court I will take a seat

and

carry on I have one question left for

you dear

are you the zenith or pollen just like

[Music]

gets response with the zenith are no

longer exists

but you are the head of this

organization I'm the head of nothing

Your Honor if I may object have a seat

young man strix bytes paulten Your Honor

I have a very valid question on the

question you have presented to my client

who I represent you are not what you

claim to be and therefore have no right

to ask questions of me

I am absolutely his lawyer paltin is

actually totally convinced himself he is

his real interest no I am his I will

just answer the question if that's all

right I was deep within the Senate our

lair on my own business trying to

protect our lives of others and within

that I confronted the Santa Thor himself

a beholder living within the sewers of

water keep as many more have before I

slayed that beholder

from there I then placed through with

allies a series of powder kegs to

destroy the zenithal air bringing it all

collapsing down it no longer exists

are you done

dear fool go on to say you also

mentioned the vandalism and theft within

the temple itself that was the same

beholder that I had slain before the one

that had and this happened before I went

down into there this was just briefly

before and he kidnapped or tried to

kidnap a friend of mine and no wasn't

gonna stand for it so I went after him I

know that the zanaffar is the head of

this criminal organization which is why

I slew him I I that could provide

further evidence I have a ledger of all

of his dealings a ledger yes and you

will provide it to this court I can it's

not on my person but I'm able to it was

a ledger belonging to a sort of

accountant by the name of Norrell he

says we will see this ledger at your

earliest convenience

certainly one more thing there was a

theft in the temple of a bottle of wine

do you know anything about it

yes is the thief present in this room

yes

and who is it who stole this bottle of

wine like there is no need for fingers

to be pointed before I know who took the

bottle of wine deaath boys to himself

I'd literally just said no pointing

fingers excuse me sir excuse me sir uh

okay then he says I believe that you are

not responsible for the death of father

Luke sunbright and I have concluded and

despite your many escapades in the city

against the Santa thar and others you

have not in any way hindered justice I

put aside my own prejudices in this

matter for as a dwarf I am colored by

the fact that you have committed an

atrocity against my people who it you

cannot be forgiven but that is neither

here nor there and not my place to judge

as that did not occur within the walls

of this great city however on the matter

of theft I hereby charge you with said

crime and you are to suffer the

following punishment forthwith in

accordance with the code legal you shall

be imprisoned for a tenday in the

dungeons of Castle water deep and paid

damages equal to the value of the stolen

goods which I hereby valued at 500 gold

pieces and he hammers its tricks just

like turned back into herself out of

evil into pocket and be like pawn

who else would steal why Anna remove the

prisoner he will be taken to the castle

forthwith and released in 10 days

payment can be made to the clerk within

a month

that is all and the old dwarf wakes up

and leaves

can we never bring in things or

something all right deaath is marched

away by Todd and a couple other guards

in Lublin run up to the magistrate

before he leaves guards his protection

detail impose themselves between you but

distribute that's not how it works

[Laughter]

so like everyone's already left the room

now there yet people are vacating

quickly you can see the lawyer and odd

steel toes are assured out by guards as

well can I ask the guards or the clerk

at the desk or something if she can

visit death in the cells are there

visits allowed in courtroom jails but no

visits allowed in Castle water Tina but

I tell them that he's claustrophobic and

he might hurt himself in the cell they

don't care

I look at Paulson and I'm like why did

you do that take the wine no why didn't

you say it was you did you did you not

literally watch me try to do that

I was literally literally and everyone

else in chat I was literally trying to

do that I was shut up before I got to

finish my sentence she doesn't even talk

to it she just leaves she's pleased well

you're like the last three in the

courtroom how so

and she doesn't she doesn't come home

okay where does she go she's sleeping

black staff tower Oh on the ground okay

crying very good very good all right d/f

you are born away you're put in the back

of a paddy wagon to take from the castle

Ward up the side of Mount Waterdeep to

the spur upon which Castle Waterdeep is

perched okay

see y'all in ten days tricks is gonna

try and sneak in how Oh probably a rat

okay - the witch hat okay

there's probably a ton of rats down

there yeah probably

absolutely okay so she's gonna go after

after sulking outside of black staff

tower for some time and vajra doesn't

answer her like Roger probably just like

throws some like like water on her hat

or something no you don't get any

response from vajra okay

you're not even clear that she's home

and the captain agua of the City Watch

will be responsible for delivering death

safely to the castle palton and Evelyn

you see Strix has stormed off and

disappeared what do you guys do where

are we wherever your room yeah still the

court room are there abouts

evylyn is just kind of looking at palton

like trying to understand what just

happened did did you actually steal the

wine all Mia's leaves when you leave the

glow around you dissipates wonder what

that was evil and you are now alone in

the room I think she sits down and has a

cry okay a lot has happened too even

today in Pauls I'm just her and walked

out her friend death is going to jail

her father figure is dead

she's banned from participating in legal

proceedings she just sits down on one of

the like hard benches with her head in

her hands and has a little cartoon cry

okay and then once she has completely

cried herself out show

fly home and no one will be there so

she'll probably cry again and then buck

up and pretend she wasn't crying so that

she can interact with waffles and the

kids and tell them everything is fine

and everyone will be home soon okay yeah

so you go back home and of course

waffles and and and the kids have no

idea of what's gone what's transpired at

all so they're having what's to them a

fairly ordinary hyperactive day so when

you walk in you find their spirits

uplifting if nothing else crabby old

Albie is still hiding out in the kitchen

but everybody else having a good time he

doesn't like when Strix isn't home right

and so you guys you sort of gathered

them around and kind of take comfort in

their their purity I was gonna say if

they're playing a game or something I'm

like oh don't mind me

everyone will be home soon just keep

playing and she just sits and kind of

like wistfully watches their innocent

play okay palton where you wandering off

to bar

all right hander will pour you a drink

oh this is so sad dizzy pour my drink

whilst also holding I'm just like just

like drunk rambling hand raised like man

you get me yeah okay I try to try again

my friend na jale try to not having go

to jail for some I did it's like the

plot doesn't even let me do the right

thing anymore man I feel like I feel

like I'm being pigeon-holed into the

least likable character and you know

maybe I got over that arc it's hard it's

hard for your character to develop I

mean you know I mean it's hard to come

back from trying to kill all your

friends but to be fair you know like I

didn't really want to do that I just

I did and then I'm just I'm gonna do all

these cool things and I've got like

pages of really uplifting monologues I

didn't get to use so I know man what do

you think antic holds up a gun

[Laughter]

alright a the black staff you don't know

none of you know this but the reason the

black staff is not at her tower is

because she is meeting privately with

one of the one of the mass Lords of

Waterdeep whom she knows oh that being a

certain moment run and you gonna borrow

that gun for a moment and she she

discusses with him in confidence this

conversation that she had with Strix

about DF fate and how he's likely to

spend the rest of his life in jail and

she says but you know a mass Lord can

overturn the verdict of any magistrate

in the city and so you know if if if

this party of adventurers is to be

successful in this city we probably

shouldn't have the law bear down on them

quite so mightily maybe maybe you could

write a letter and have this thing

thrown out and so she basically advises

him such and actually gives him a letter

that she's drafted he puts it in a

drawer serve all my sentence he looks at

it he reads it folds it and puts it in a

drawer why can I see that so well in my

mind his face

alright deaath your your your whisperer

was not lying when he said that the cell

would be far worse than the one you were

just in Castle water deep is built upon

a much older structure called Nemours

hold not much of which on the surface

remains it was a titanic wooden fort

built by NIMH or a warlord who kind of

was based here before there was even a

city but now the castle stands in its

place and the castle itself was quite

old but the dungeons underneath it are

ancient by comparison and crumbling

rundown

sagging wet rat infested water flooded

hellhole quite quite a difference from

the clean swept albeit dark and cramped

cell that you were in the smells here

are is is something you will probably

never forget as you are sealed away in

this tomb this rotting waterlogged pit

and probably in the same state or worse

than you were in before

yeah probably near catatonic yes now

you're a human and there's no light here

so you can't see but you become very

aware very quickly that you're not in

the cell alone

good great I'm glad like there's another

physical presence there's another

physical presence in the cell it's just

not aware of correct and even as your

eyes begin to adjust to the darkness in

in a few min in the mere minutes that

you've been here it's still too hard to

actually see the figure and the air but

you just sense on some Rogi level that

you are in this cell with another person

cool now DSS said and on high alert yes

and the voice a voice comes out of the

darkness and says

I would like it very much if you how do

you say did not involve yourself any

further with lady Rosner and her quest

for the Dragons do you think you could

perhaps find other distractions in this

beautiful city other things to occupy

your time

I don't want to repeat of what we have

just seen you know it's very distracting

who are you my name is Joel axel beret

and the gold is mine

do we understand each other

I don't get me wrong I like you I like

all of you even though you killed some

of my best men that is a tragedy that's

what brings us together

really at least caught my attention made

me realize that you are very dangerous

when you're given free rein that ends

today

dear father say

the

well what do you don't know

I'm not sure des would respond

necessarily

there is a hand on your shoulder Thanks

it's very delicate gentle not a crushing

grip and says you will come out of this

much stronger than you were before you

don't have to fear this place and do not

fear the darkness we all suffer the

things we fear but there are real fears

and then there are the ones we create

ourselves this place is the latter be

strong my friend

and when you're out who knows I may come

to your place for a drink and one of

those tasty pies

[Laughter]

ESO just respond with you know nothing

of my suffering maybe but I know who

murdered father Luke's son bright duh

for the first first time DF kind of like

snaps out of it and no actually you kind

of comes to attention

I had it turns back over his shoulder

just peering through the darkness as

much as possible just take me through

like the body motion showing that he's

very much paying attention a voice come

so close to your ear you can feel his

lips brushing against your skin all

right or maybe it's the illusion of that

you feel it he says

and then you sense that the presence is

gone

yeah

okay so even after he's gone yes just

kind of thoughts will taunt him out loud

but more off to himself and just be like

and just say something along the lines

of see what you want relax all we've got

your gun that's where we'll stop hmm why

is Jarl axle so supportive I was very

mixed mixed feelings there it's like the

whole episode I was hearing the Perry

Mason theme song in my head no one else

in the world would recognize it we

should never be crime people we

shouldn't be most things that's true I

don't know man law practice will palton

start up his law firm I never understand

what Halton is all about we'll strip

will Strix ever make it into the bowels

of Castle water deep to reunite with

their friend these questions and Marv
