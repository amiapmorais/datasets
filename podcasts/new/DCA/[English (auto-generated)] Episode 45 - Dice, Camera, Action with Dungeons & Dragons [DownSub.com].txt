Oh

[Laughter]

hi everybody and welcome to the latest

episode of dice camera action

you might hear Ana's crickets in the

background oh and I see a cute little

dog sheep yeah she's so ferocious

yeah very oh so sweet

final episode was last weekend so

previously um in our show the waffle

crew was sent by the Dwarven King horn

off to find out what the fire Giants are

up to under iron slag or in iron slag I

should say the King's advisor Azon bran

spire of Clan bronze fire sent an

armored dwarf bodyguard named crack

along with the waffle crew to accompany

them on their recon mission crack

disappeared up in the yak-yak folk

village leaving behind his black armor

of invulnerability which then evylyn

took to wearing and is wearing presently

within iron slag palton became separated

from the others by a wall of stone cast

by an earth genie called a dowel this

Dao claimed to be on a mission to

retrieve an iron golem from the depths

of iron slag and believing paulten to be

some sort of Gollum whisperer dragooned

him into accompanying him to deactivate

the fire giant override on the iron

golem this override causes the Golem to

obey fire Giants above all others paltin

couldn't do it and discovered a glyph on

the inside of the golem indicating or

suggesting that it was built by the

dwarves of the bronze fire clan

this discovery um put palton and the DAO

at odds and paltin cast a thunder wave

in the Dow's face and then ran off to

the door but before I could get there

got cabal

song by the iron golem which is

currently under the douse command

meanwhile technical term Kabong yes

exactly

meanwhile the awful the watch the waffle

crew had set off a forge wide alarm and

after doing so evil and managed to save

the life of the dwarf prisoner who was

contained inside Duke zalto's giant iron

Maul the head of which is built like a

cage after freeing this dwarf evylyn the

dwarf DF and Strix fled to a chamber

with these giant water collecting

cisterns in them and there became pinned

between Luke salto now covered head to

toe in molten iron and his wife the

Duchess brim scarda carrying a big

cauldron in one hand and wearing a cloak

or dress made out of black dragon hide

and wings so let's pick up their ooh

let's yes the Paulding to start their No

so Strix you had Strix you had drunk a

potion that increases your strength to

that of a frost giant alright and and

you were going to attempt to push I do

fall toes Maul out of the way he's using

it to block the doors I am what you came

through I wanted to make him I want to

make him stumble if I could sort of by

knocking his weight yes I see okay so I

would like you to make a strength at

Lennox check against the Dukes well good

thing I have a potion right yeah with

your strength bonus at your strength

bonus is now plus six oh wow huh

so nineteen okay uh uh so you push hard

on his hammer and successfully knock him

off kilter but of course he sort of

falls back in toward the door because

that's where his

that's where the weight was that's

that's fine so he is knocked off his

feet and flex a molten iron just sort of

splash everywhere onto the floor onto

the door onto the walls but none of you

get seriously hit by it and so he goes

down with a large crash because he's

wearing a pretty heavy iron armor uh and

um you you're his wife is um just at a

point where she can see him topple over

but isn't quite sure what happened

exactly can I quickly misty step back to

everyone else that's a bonus action so

yes you could okay okay so um DF what do

you do when Duke zalto topples and hits

the floor amazing question so those

doors are still closed yeah yeah and

then opposite direction from those

dwarves is fire giant - Queen correct

where there are water cisterns yeah

we're and I am currently chillin with

the dwarf it work uh

evylyn uh art now most of us still

invisible or um so I'm not anymore

Strix is not invisible you are um evylyn

was she invisible too at one point I

guess she hasn't attacked anybody yet so

the door was not correct yes so

everybody but everybody but Strix in the

dwarf are I think invisible and you this

may be totally off as my invulnerability

worn off for my armor though I can still

get batted around and I'm yeah yeah okay

cool yeah yeah it's only been like two

minutes since you activated that so you

got like eight minutes feels

turn it off feels like it's been a

couple years yeah I've certainly felt

like I've aged that much so DF uh what's

more you're invisible what we like to do

I don't know nothing is it as a viable

answer to that questions oh he's he

stumbled but he's not like not prone or

anything

he is effectively prone at this point in

time Oh probably not for long and he has

his way okay you know what

I trust Evelyn to be on her own so I'm

going to stealth away and just just

lease kin to like some other positioning

okay just this so stopping invisible let

me use my myself to try to get to

basically the opposite side of them okay

so up against the doors but on the other

side of it yeah okay

sacred idea all right that that uses I

mean you can get there easily with your

movement right um and you just hang okay

uh

palton you are in another room The Dukes

war room uh you regain consciousness

you're kind of slumped up against the

wall and the thing that wakes you up is

a loud clanging sound just a banging

against iron and it's very loud it seems

to shake the floor around you and when

you look up that genie guy is sort of

hunkered down in front of you um just

kind of poking you a little bit to see

if you're not dead

okay and then next you you can see the

iron golem is standing with one iron

hand on the iron door to the room and

occasionally there's another banging

sound and he just sort of gets knocked a

little bit by it but he's holding the

door closed with one hand and the the

genie the DAO says to you

[Laughter]

as I am glad you're alive and me too

this is I am sorry that I had to do that

um it is not the way I planned things to

go but your thunder wave seems to have

sounded an alarm and now we are trapped

in here at least for now

oh this belongs to you and he holds up

one of your teeth say and you feel

around in your mouth it's like oh no

Jenna front water is in my molar it's

like it's like one of the top ones just

behind your eye tooth okay so that's not

that's not the moneymaker sauce all

right yeah yeah - one - Chris yeah and

he says I believe there are fire Giants

trying to get into the room here so the

I'm counting on you disable the fire

giant override on the column now let's

put a pin in that

so why he says because then you will

live and will be able to get out of here

and back to sit on the light bar and I

golem belongs I am sure you had figured

out by now that this golem was made by

the bronze fire clan who cement their

ancient alliance would be fire giants in

the old wars clearly they do not want

anyone to know that that's what happened

and so we have to get this out of here

so really the the question is you may

die yes but how long do you want to live

all right you present me with it with an

interesting spot to be in

so how long how long till those fire

Giants get in he says I can hear maybe

one two of them out there now but if

more show up I can I can't say we'll be

able to keep them from coming in and

what do you think they're gonna do when

they get in here I suspect they will try

to kill you I of course have an escape

plan for myself but I'd rather take the

golem with me I do not like failure

that's what we didn't have an escape

plan hmm

dose he says but I can offer some

protection for you okay I'm listening he

says I brought something with me that

could serve you well and I will give it

to you as a sign of good faith oh yeah

faith

yep that's something we I have in this

relationship for sure he says that dis

our chasm

I know sarcasm no turn no and he says

please please my friend let me let me

show you one least act of generosity AG

did Anna

disappear she was having some problems

we'll be right back okay uh all right he

clicks his fingers and I'll deal with

the consequences in a moment normally

would go to evil in this point in time

but let's skip over her for the time

being and go to the fire Giants uh so

Duke zalto um he's not exactly sure what

happened uh oh and there's Anna their

seamless nailed it you saw nothing all

right

okay yeah I can hear you there's a

little bit of it sounds like I said to

your laptop's internal like this ah

gotcha sounds like a dial-up modem how

about now is that better yes yes okay

yes so evylyn um your fluttering

invisible I guess over the fire giant

Duke okay and then suddenly the armor

you're wearing disappears but and palton

the black armor appears on you what oh

cool great awesome perfect cool he was

naked no I better undergarments but yes

your arm the Dow snaps his fingers and

the armor disappears from one place and

reappears on you balton so now you're

like encased in this black plate armor

do I recognize it

yeah it is the armor that once belonged

to crack dragons for the dwarf bodyguard

of house bronze fire that accompanied

you and mysteriously disappeared did I

know that I even had it er yes okay so

obviously laughs saw it being worn by

her all right I don't know where it went

right it just correct her to just

disappear it just disappeared off your

body leaving you Armour less I desired

oh man

winter giveth let the under take it away

what is so nonchalant about this and it

is actually your turn evylyn uh as soon

as the armor disappears it is returned

did anything happen with my teammates

that I should be aware of last couple

minutes

no DF and is invisible and see you're

not exactly sure where he is and Strix

move back toward the dwarf after she

pushed down dukes although I think I um

I'm just gonna try to like make a

distraction away from my friends so I do

I see anything I could throw or anything

like that uh there's nothing in the

hallway that you're in and when you look

into the room with the cistern you can

see that there are some old like rotting

barrels sort of in the corners of the

room you could theoretically fly over

into the room pick up one of those rowdy

barrels and throw that yeah that's what

I'm gonna do okay

I'm not attacking at that point right

I'm just making noise if you're not

throwing it at a creature you're just

right causing a disturbance it's not

going to break the spell that's what I

want to do okay so you fly in you pick

up one of these barrels and you hurl it

against a wall or whatever and I really

enjoy that because even really likes

breaking things okay uh so you get that

that the Duke is a little distracted

trying to get himself back up to his

feet which he's about to do but your

noise certainly distracts the Duchess

when she sees the barrel fly through the

air and hit a wall she's obviously very

confused about where that came from

and then when you're done that the Duke

gets to his feet uh

heaves his hammer up into the air

actually looks down at the only two

enemies that he can see which is Strix

and the dwarf and now Strix you just

displayed magical ability to teleport

yourself correct of course I did

all right I know magic

alright so the Duke is going to take a

swing at you with the mall great nothing

like the mall of I don't know fire gods

just a flat me into the wall yeah Casey

just just sort of gives like this

croquet swing okay and rolls at 26 on

the attack roll it is gonna hit

definitely yeah alright and then let me

remember how few hit points I have left

uh he does 34 yeah I don't have that

dang it

uh and as he hits you um you guys

excited because that'd be pretty funny

and he's doing bludgeoning damage with

this and you can tell DF and evylyn just

by the way he landed the blow that he

wasn't trying to bash tricks his brains

out but knock her unconscious hmm so she

falls to the ground but isn't like

mulched I could have been though yes

that's it

okay guys for me a big sweep of the

hammer and she's down he then takes a

second attack and tries to make it on

the dwarf and he crits the dwarf oh god

he's gonna be mold is a bad day and uh

the dwarf goes down okay just remember

someone had to save him yeah yeah and so

uh that's for all all the enemies that

zalto can see are now lying unconscious

on the floor and his wife turns to him

and says there must be more of them

invisible ones in the room and at this

point in time as she said at the end of

last session she shouted back to the

kitchen to get the flower you see two

goblins sort of stumbled forth into the

room evylyn and they've got big flower

bags

and you'll remember that last week when

you were playing juniper the goblins had

gone into the storeroom some flower out

of the room now you can see they're

bringing the flower bags over to the

Duchess and she tells her husband that

she has a way to find invisible

intruders by baking a delicious egg with

it uh crap yep and it is uh now Strix

astern Tech near the dwarfs turn he's

unconscious he doesn't need to make

death saves Strix is unconscious she

doesn't need to make that yeh idea

you're up alright uh no one is plan to

what you know we have everything fine

we have no escape it's exactly what we

wanted to happen it's just not talking

if I don't take my turn long enough yeah

we'll have to take some sort of isn't

like a class when the teachers gonna

call on you and you're just like not

looking at the teacher the teacher knows

that you're doing that so you get called

on they'll move on eventually I didn't

do my homework

Oh God all right so with Strix being

knocked unconscious uh des immediate

reaction would be to get over to her

okay uh and then trying to try to try to

lift her up or get her out of there

right yeah

by doing this where he's like - where

you going to try to lift her - as you

got big closed doors behind you giant

sized doors behind you and then there's

the sister in room with the Duchess in

it yet hasn't thought that far ahead

okay you just got to the pick her up

part is just instinctually get to his

down Ally and there it's oh I don't know

the question in my mind is are you

actually picking her up because you know

that will look weird yes where

huh-uh say guy grant I grabs her and

then uh that doesn't even know he

doesn't even know just uh tries tries to

get back to the door and see if maybe

they can fit underneath it or maybe in

press against it by himself or pick up

her arm and press against it maybe

that'll work that's physics so you are

trying to move her yes okay so Strix

apparently unconscious sort of picks

yourself up all of that I kind of

dragged herself across our five day

superstitious if they are the whole time

I'm going no and they're more

intelligent than you think Oh God all

right um

excellent so while DF does that uh Paul

turns up but he's out of the room so

evylyn uh we're back to you I I see this

happening right cuz I yeah

I've been keeping an eye on them so I

definitely know exactly what's going on

and I see these goblins with flower and

I just I'm trying to make as much ruckus

as I can to convince and that the

invisible people in the room are not

over there so I'm grabbing a barrel and

throwing it again but like close to the

goblins to tempt them to try to throw

flour at these barrels instead about my

friends okay

essentially trying to disorient them as

to where to place the flower and I'm

making like I'm all like land and do a

few footsteps and then fly away you know

like I'm just I'm trying to do as much

distraction sauce yep alright um palton

I will back to you okay so I'm in this

armor you are in this armor these fire

Giants are trying to get in

yep so and the DAO says and you know

that you can't you've tried to disable

the the override but you don't even know

where it is

now you did see in the chest cavity of

the golem some other part

struts and pointy bits and things like

that

um but you have no idea what they do

okay um so paulten is not the best

note-taker mm-hmm and a little

scatterbrained it might be a little hazy

on the lore of everything going on so if

I have this right that gone was made by

the the tribe and that's bad yeah so the

bronze the bronze fire clan which is one

of the one of the many clans of citilab

are apparently built this golem and if

the Dow the Dow assumed that you had

divined this information already because

he thinks you're brilliant all right

that didn't mean often say that is that

is suited that uh that you and sorry sir

he sort of filled in the gaps for you a

little bit and told you that at some

point in the past the bronze fires gave

this golem to the Giants which is odd

because dwarves and giants hate each

other okay means the bronze pyres had

formed this alliance with Giants and it

appears they don't want anyone to know

which is why the goal which is why the

bronze fires opposed the idea of you

coming here in the first place and

subsequently why they didn't want the

golem to be found here school they just

get back to us and then we'll fill you

in but given your present situation

unless unless you can shut off the golem

override one of two things will probably

happen the fire Giants will break in

take control of the golem and do damage

to you bodily or as opposed to mentally

or mostly probably those two maybe all

of them yeah or uh or two um the Dow

does something to you

but the Dow says he does have an escape

plan he's for himself I don't even know

how to override it

correct do I you thought I was looking

when I was looking in there did I see a

pretty sure way to shut it off no cool

um you weren't able to make heads or

tails out of it um okay so I'm going to

I'm going to tell them

okay all right I have an idea

shot in the dark but I'm going to try it

and I think it's gonna work out for us

mainly mean us um so is it thunder wave

boilers though

how big a big is the the golem the gong

stands up about ten feet tall a little

bit taller than the genie okay okay okay

yeah he says once we gain control of the

golem we can use it to fight our way out

and the Giants were very little they can

do to it it's almost impervious to magic

interesting all right so I'm going to

try it but I want to make sure that just

in case something goes wrong during the

process that I can go uninterrupted that

makes sense right

nothing will go wrong I believe in you

my friend okay cool so I'm going to go

next to the giant okay and I'm good now

you say when you say the giant the the

the the gall okay and I'm going to cast

Lee omens tiny Hut around both of us cuz

he'll say it right

10-foot radius yeah okay cool

so now I'm in here with him and now I

just live here forever

is there good wedding and now we have a

sitcom yeah so now you are encased you

in the golem are now inside the the

immobile dome of force that springs up

around you and lasts for up to eight

hours cool just a guy in a golem in the

omens hot did you do

there's your sitcom okay yeah when you

do that the genie says uh Kisan can

still pass through it says I fail to see

how this helps me it helped it helps me

help you go on that was the whole state

there's for this this is a multi-step

process that was step one board more up

to okay so so I can access inside him

right uh yeah so you you're the golem

still sort of has an open chest cavity

compartment okay

and like I'm poking around do I see

anything of interest um yeah you can see

in the cavity most of the cavity is

dominated by this built-in brazier that

has a flame erupting from it and the

genie mentioned to you previously that

this is a fire spirit and that basically

animates the golem and all around it you

can see prongs and other protrusions

inside the chest cavity the Golem is

powered by magic more so than being a

clockwork creation so you don't see like

piles of gears or stuff but there are

sort of odd struts prongs um and um

bolts and things and symbols you see

arcane symbols um here there and

everywhere okay so I'm going to reach in

there I'm going to thunder wave them

from the inside

oh oh so like have the thunder wave

resonate inside the golem you mean oh

yeah a-all right so you cast a thunder

wave spell another loud spell made all

the louder as the sound resonates inside

the golem that's great

what did you compare that sound - Chris

oh gosh like firecracker in a trash can

yeah that's probably a good analogy I

like that one

cool okay um ed when I look over I'm

like don't worry part of plan no cause

for concern

all right so now the Golem what I do if

I D twenty there it is the golem has

magic resistance so it has advantage on

saving throws against all spells good to

know now all right now this is a

constitution saving throw all right

so a roll damage for your thunder wave

okay 2d uh yeah right all right cool

eight okay uh The Golem takes a little

bit of that as its as it sort of

reverberates from within um did I unfix

it yeah you're not sure what's he doing

we'll find out on his turn he was

supposed to be the new Simon who's

supposed to be the chosen one

all right yes so we will see what the

golem does on its turn and then it is

so we did Ebola already Strix is

unconscious as usual nothing to see here

it's the Giants turn okay so Duke zalto

can tell that somebody has picked Strix

up and is trying to move her he is going

to smack that invisible something but

disadvantage because he can't see DF ah

look at that so uh his first swing is a

total of 15 ha sucks hits the ground

beside you his second one is 13 sucks

harder and it's clear to him that he

didn't hit flesh or bones with either of

those two swings and that and you hear

the the Dutchess a patient's husband and

she takes one of the flower bags and

comes striding over toward you and him

DF and just starts casting it about

uncanny dodge she's going to spread it

in a 15-foot cube uh basically over

Strix so a form of DFS you take shape a

white cloudy ghostly dusty form the same

oh it's like you're a ghost again yeah

all of it lands in Dee's hair and on his

shoulders and then bits of his gear so

he sort of got piles of powdered flour

woo him and uh your footsteps and drag

marks are also visible at this point in

time I'll clear my eyes and then brush

it off his tricks his face oh yeah she's

still dirty it doesn't make it their

friends yeah okay she just keeps trying

like what the heck yeah that's it's your

turn

good both the Duchess and the Duke are

now glaring down at you Strix is just

caked in like flower robes just like oh

you know i yeah i'm right go on alright

um so III have no real clear means of

escape at this very moment correct

okay uh I'll try to blow Missy Wow Chris

my diplomacy diplomacy okay guys like

are you saying anything to them uh uh

are you just like uh I'll say something

my bad

give them like a a you're not here a

their fiery rage filled eyes literally

fiery staring down at me covered in

flour yes

so what I'll make the movements to go

anywhere or do anything that could be

seen as threatening and just shout back

at them um hold on it'll be it'll be uh

the doctor says choose your next words

wisely

you scared him so bad

SD have wet himself it all depends on

you good flower got your tongue yes

alone Rapala dies for any and all ruckus

it is not our desire it's not what you

think we are not enemies we're not here

to fight we're not here to kill uh just

give us a moment to explain make a

persuasion check that's not good

ate that wetting yourself really hurts

you there the Duke in the bed Chester

sort of look at each other look back at

you astonished more than anything okay

uh the my locks dog made it ate chat

okay one more isn't gonna help uh the DA

the Dow palton sort of presses himself

up against the dome and says what are

you doing that is you're going to get

yourself killed

ah but I might not uh alright and then

it is the Dow isn't going to do anything

else except uh actually take some steps

back away from the dome I don't like

that

he seems he seems genuinely worried for

you and then the golem looks at you and

flame sort of burns in its eyes were

none burned before hmm

so I did something yes and you see a

part of the helm where it would have it

doesn't have a mouth but a section of

the helm sort of peels back or withdraws

creating an orifice below its eyes and

out of that orifice billows poisonous

gas Oh for crying out loud so I need you

to make a constitution saving throw it's

all in the tens okay big money I an

accountant a guy and go on 19 okay you

take 22 poison damage as opposed to the

45 oh no ice no 19 nice yeah you made it

you succeeded did we wander into a place

that's too high level for us yeah yeah

yes ah hey what are PGs don't give you

proper directions with the broom didn't

say I had to be that tall to enter uh

yes so um I believe you're at zero hit

points again again yeah there's a

pattern now hmm welcome to the club I'm

sure we're balls hanging out somewhere

mmm all right so and you're not constant

you don't have to concentrate on the

spell either so you're stuck in there in

your Leland's tiny Hut yeah you'll see

me you'll feel all right everything's

fine

important question is the mood lighting

still on when you're passed out

where does it just turn red it is a

blinking red oh you just Dutch Davin

yourself inside that Hut that's fair

okay the DF you see the doors that you

had been closed behind you in Duke zalto

are suddenly pulled open yeah behind you

c6 fire Giants well with a seventh fire

giant about half the size standing

between them like surrounded by them

probably take on a little fire

giant and you can see as soon as the

doors open and this fire giant force

arrives that the Duke and the Duchess

just sort of look down at you and smile

okay and make strikes wave like the

little the little fire giant says mom

dad is everything okay oh it's the

babies oh it's a kid fire giant yeah

totally okay well an adolescent this is

the same fire giant by the way he was

hanging the dwarf over the furnace by

his ankles sessions ago this is the chat

sometimes says things that are just so

on the nose bad faith 90 he says I'm so

concerned about everything yeah and the

Duchess will um glower down at you and

say we should make slaves of all of them

and lost Holly Holly I'm sure and the

Duke says I want to know who sent them

was it the dwarfs

were you sent by the dwarves I say no it

was I that the Duchess will look over at

her husband again and say it says I'll

take care of that one and then um it is

let's see uh we are back to Paul tins

turn soap Alton I need you to make a

death save for me that's a d20 roll hmm

okay so big money big money

sixteen oh hang on hanging on before you

do that this is very important

hang on does his armor make him

invulnerable since it was activated when

he got it

I got a check the Tumen rules because

it's it may still be attuned to you at

the moment no actually the attunement

was broken when it left you so but he

would have had to react thick indeed

aw shucks yeah Holly's internet died so

she'll be back in just a little bit okay

no everything's dying right now

yeah us Internet everything there - that

or she just found the most um white way

to see sound I'm done done yeah yeah

yeah unfortunately you haven't attune to

the armor yet so yes one deaf safe

please be plenty now well that was a it

was a 16 okay that's one success get two

more you get two more of those you won't

bleed out or choke to death on poisonous

fumes as funny as it would be to die

from poisonous fumes that are gone

farted out inside a hut I I think maybe

that's not the glorious death the

pulsing deserves probably if there's

anywhere I want to go it's in the hut

I'm surrounded by my mood lighting yeah

we asked it you and your turn is up you

can see that the Duchess has set her

sights on finding you

so game mechanics question there's no

such thing as like a called shot in

fifth edition' right like I couldn't I

couldn't specifically for example use

light fall to just try to like sever the

jugular vein of one of the Giants by

surprise on the visible so just quick

slit a throat yeah just like invisible

I'll just like doink okay as easy as it

sounds

it's just that's so like slitting the

throat of a human with the toothpick

yeah

now if she were immobilized or

restrained in some way and you were able

to or she was unconscious you could coup

de gras her and essentially do auto crit

we just kind of like that but she's not

in that state

oh she she isn't but maybe she could be

if I were to cast nature's wrath on her

but there are also six other Giants and

the situation is very confusing

next to Diaz yeah yeah so stress tricks

there too yes and another question I

assume I know the answer to this one but

if I were to say like fly around like

tapping Giants heads or like dropping

little pebbles on them since I'm not

trying to hurt them I'm just trying to

poke them with that count as an attack

or not okay I thought that was what we

would say I think that I really want to

fight the Giants but I really don't I

know how Jarrod is looking at me right

now so I have zero armor on yes that is

true

um okay so ah stand down I am going to

quietly get near they've stopped

throwing the flower right well she used

up one bag um you think she might be

getting going for the second one but I

was like I was like oh over here me

flying in the air over here

so NDS over here so I'm gonna like just

quietly try to go flutter above him yeah

okay but not touch the flower I'm not

blowing you flower around my little

winged boots I'm not stepping in it

being careful

Oh Holly's back I can't hear you have to

get your microphone setup Polly but we

see you at the Rayleigh's yes all right

so you're going to try to quietly

flutter over just make a stealth check

for me oh I'm giving these purple dice

another chance they better not piss on

me

yes okay yeah I'm 14 okay um switch

sides in the room when you when you

flutter over uh toward strix and Paul or

hystrix and DF you're pretty sure they

haven't hindered down your location cool

that's good and that's did you want to

do anything else just hang for now uh

casting a protective spell would also

take away my invisibility and repel any

spell would end your in this movie okay

then I do nothing else okay Strix is

still unconscious at the moment DF you

can now actually know it's the Giants

turn Luke zalto is going to try to

grapple you yeah

so make a strength athletics check right

now Adam I have advantage yeah why uh

for I am determined

[Music]

that's this fine

athletics yeah this is the fire giant

yes bring it on

Oh b11 okay done uh he will pick you up

okay in one of his mailed

gauntleted hands can I drop Strix before

he does that sure all right

bump and there we are again please let

me do a fire there than us both getting

crushed there and he says tell your

fellow spies to reveal themselves or

I'll crush you inside do I believe them

oh go ahead and make a check okay yeah

that's pretty good inside nineteen no

standing uh you believe him completely

huh I believe him completely whose turn

is it now someone else uh so that was

yes that was his turn the Duchess grabs

the other big sack of flour and she's in

the cistern room and you can see a bunch

of goblins or she's pulled a bunch of

goblins out of the kitchen and as having

them sort of scurry around with rolling

pins and things just sort of waving them

around in the air to try to see if they

hit or locate anything um and she's just

standing there waiting to hurl the bag

of flour out at anything she perceives

or senses might be invisible nearby

she's taking no other action at the

moment um and but she does say to no one

in particular it was my husband says or

this will end badly for you all started

badly it's already bad yeah they're done

and uh yeah if you're up at last the and

the prior giant Duke says to you again

it the toy

ARC's send you and this time you're like

two feet from his face right um okay uh

one thing at a time so I'll I'll shout

out to say uh evil and stand down so

that said she knows not to charge me

more ruckus Kaitlyn has her axe out and

who says that she's like and then I'll

turn back to two zolto this one's got me

alright yeah Duke um I'll tell him

we simply lost our pets and they're

somewhere in here that's so true it's

true if they roll an inside check they

will 100% believe him the Duke says that

is the dumbest thing I've heard we've

done Dumber things okay which I could do

anything else DF because you could try

to slip out of his grasp if you want

although that might annoy him yeah

there's nowhere to go and one this high

autumns good grateful ankle or something

and just prevent myself until I start

stick by the animal thing because it's

true it is true that is the truth

alright it is at that precise moment

that there is a Titanic

followed by what sounds like something

big sort of collapsing and breaking

apart a thunderous sound echoes through

the entire Forge all of the fire Giants

are like heads turning everywhere run

run away distracted and uh you can see

the Duke and the Duchess look at each

other in surprise and alarm and the Duke

is you see him bear his teeth at you and

he says this has been a distraction I

don't even know what's going on I'm just

as strong as you one turns to all the

other fire Giants and he says get today

Assembly Hall now they they beat feet i

I as soon as I can I don't know whenever

my turn is that I'm I'm fluttering in

the air and I reach down a finger to

silently lay lay hands on strix really

quick all right and all of the Giants

immediately come pouring into the hall

and into the cistern room to move past

the Duchess toward the kitchen away from

the foundry you can see that the bucket

chain has also stopped you can't hear

its noise anymore it's ambient echoes

throughout the entire complex that that

huge crashing noise was big enough to

stop everything

are we still in initiative yes we are

and so that's des turn it is now the

Dow's turn oh he's worried about palton

oh what's he gonna do what's he gonna do

um I know what he can do all right

halten you are dying not anymore you are

stabilized okay so you don't have to

make that saves anymore

neat yes I'd lead better than the rest

of us um hanging at one HP for like

three sessions it's cool okay so what

the dow does no one knows the iron golem

blah blah blah the fire Giants are

beating feet and uh paltin is currently

unconscious so even your up I I'm doing

my sneaky lay on hands which I guess

probably counts as a spell so nope oh ha

ha ha at once uh yeah so I just lay on

hands for five because I'm trying to

case tricks you are conscious yeah 5 hit

points and I just yell time to run she's

like covered in flowers like what is

this let's gross

okay ready let's go ow lay on heads for

you is a bonus gosh I should know this

okay the damn game I reckon you know in

before tweets of like and I should

really learn this game I never play

paladin's I there we go okay so um as an

action so that's an action for you okay

so I'm done

yes okay um and so next up is Strix oh

great because the game you look up and

you see Duke salto looming above you a

bunch of fire giant storming past you uh

the son by the way Duke's also son is

not going with the others he's standing

now next to his dad sure and uh he's

still you know about ten feet

also he's a big kid but so strix you've

got a young fire giant and fire giant do

pluming above you the Duke has DF in his

gauntlet at hand

oh come on strict saves us all Oh what

my fireball yeah oh great um well first

I'd like to cry right good does that

count as a bonus action or for me I

guess you know it's always a bonus

action it's a hardened iron a molten

iron that are sort of coming off of the

Duke now in sort of cast-off bits that

are kind of piling up around you strix

great always the fire great uh my god I

know like don't have anything help

anyone right now oh and you're covered

with flour so it's like yeah really

gross I mean she's used to that she

knows Mike doesn't like she still

doesn't enjoy it um well we're just I

don't know what to do everything's got

Darryl I didn't hear the noise though I

was unconscious correct

so they're all Reynold it was time to

run actually there's public there's

probably some residual noises things

sort of platter and roll from Tom James

Great Hall so you are aware that

something big has just happened

elsewhere okay well what what has

politan done so evil and did tell Strix

to run so she'll just be like okay just

like take off so there are two possible

directions one is you can take off where

the fire Giants are running which is

past the Dutchess toward the kitchen or

you can go back the way they came which

is in the molten iron pan we go back

there a places fan so you're you're

running with the fire Giants yes okay on

the wall this just flower-covered T

plague all smoky trail yeah the dusty

trail following the fire Giants

okay yeah that's right and she's just

gonna yell sorry idea so you stand up

that's happy move you move another 15

feet and then another 30 feet that gets

you well into the cistern room where you

can see bunches of goblins wandering

around with rolling pins and sticks and

brooms just sort of swinging them around

pell-mell but they're getting absolutely

cleared out of the way by the fire

Giants barreling through so if you stay

in the fire Giants wake you won't have

to worry about running into goblins

great yeah it's just like it's like I'm

following an ambulance on the freeway

yes exactly and you do sort of get your

you're about ten feet away from the

Duchess at this point you can see that

she's got a great sort of pillar of

orange hair spiraling up over the top of

her head and she wears a great black

cape made out of dragons wings and she

wears a black scale dress she's also got

a big cauldron in her hand and she sees

you running faster regester like pike

off just keep running okay that's good

to know

all right the fire Giants turns um Duke

zalto yeah we'll take you and shove you

into his Maul into the cage and the head

of his Moll okay and then the cage door

will snap shut oh yeah it seems to as

soon as it closes seems to lock

automatically okay so and then once you

are locked in his Maul he goes storming

after the other fire Giants toward the

Assembly Hall so DF is actually

accompanying you Strix but not in the

manner you expected oh boy well she's at

least like Oh got a friend the Duchess

will try to mash you with a cauldron

straight now as you told her to half off

well I feel good about doing that so

she rolled a 21-2 hit with the cauldron

I mean of course she gets like only 5

hit points no yes

so she just flattens you well basically

she just takes the cauldron and drops it

on you as your run past is this like a

cloud of flour yes a lot of flour you

are unconscious

once again oh damn it ah well good thing

I saved lots of lay on hands points

bring you back again alright uh then DF

your turn okay um so is there any kind

of like actual locking mechanism or

anything that would be so the locking

mechanism is contained within the you

you saw actually that the Duke had some

sort of release catch on the handle when

he was shaking the dwarf out okay um to

cause it to open you think that same

mechanism is now closed again so he can

unlock it by holding on to the haft

there doesn't seem to be a lock on the

cage itself but from where I am where I

can see them just there doesn't seem to

be a way for me to manipulate or act

there's nothing to manipulate as far as

you can tell but that doesn't stop you

from trying to use these tools to try to

Jimmy it open you might be able to get

at Mehcad hidden mechanisms right that's

that's not as mostly wondering okay yeah

so like the moment he's been here like

in this cage small yeah uh you me they

gets like starts getting like panicked

breathing in like yeah like starts kind

of losing control on themselves come

right the moment she's inside this cage

yeah in bars yeah um yeah it doesn't

like this so almost like with trembling

hands and fondling like he'll look at

whatever the locker mechanism with his

Steve's tools just try to do something

okay go ahead you have disadvantage to

try to unlock this thing from inside

uh hold on I got math uh 23 oh wait this

consider a pick Locker just slightly on

track

oh this is just the dexterity check

that's just a theory

yeah so not side of hands no sleight of

hand all right

then very different this will be a 50k

you do - oh my gosh

all right so that does not unlock it but

there's nothing stopping you for trying

again okay uh all right so you're sort

of knocked around a little bit as he's

walking and I and the mall is moving um

it makes it even harder to pick this

thing you realize right and you're being

jostled about now uh that's it for DF

halton you awake once more surprised not

that again yes you are currently not

inside your Lea omens hot um you can see

that the dow is looking down on you

again any sense I am surprised you're

not dead Sam he says I don't know what

you were trying to do but iron golems

are not that easy to destroy say oh I

wasn't trying to destroy it there was

like a thing and I thought like a like a

spark or the like trip I don't know man

it made more sense in Richard less sense

I don't know how you doing man

he says we really need to get the

override deactivated okay but I don't

know if the golem will let you anywhere

near it I'll make sure you see it on the

other side of the room now you can see

that there's a hole in the floor inside

your leo

hot okay um hmm so this thing is not too

happy with me huh no it's probably fine

like okay I'm I'm just gonna ask Dao

like so I you have any ideas uh he he

takes a look them at your everything

that's happened and he says I cannot

leave without a golem we must take it

with us he says but I'm afraid that will

attack you so I will have to shut it

down and I will attempt to carry it out

hmm okay that works for me he says uh

but I if we don't have it to fight for

us then I will have to have my armor

back to protect myself

oh this armor

yes I don't know you're kind of a big

dude he says the armor will resize to

fit its wearer

oh I more meant I'm much squishier than

you he says I can shrink you down and

put you inside the golem I don't know I

don't like that and I don't I don't know

how I feel about that oh I'm sorry you

said you had a better plan

go on are you gonna fight these guys are

you just gonna kind of book it out of

here he says I'm going to activate the

power of the armor that will render me

temporarily immune to their attacks okay

then are you going to fight them or are

you gonna try and just get straight out

I am going to try to get out as quickly

as possible and fight anyone who comes

in my way so this shrinking plan will he

still be mad at me

yes but I'm going to put you inside him

so he can't hurt you

that doesn't sound like it okay well

great plan that's awesome

I am on board I guess get wot Bolton he

will he will cast the spell on you and

he says do not try to resist and he will

cast reduce on you and shrink you down

to basically half proportions so you're

like a three-foot-tall your assignment

sized palta my tiny voice at all hey and

then he will snap his fingers and the

armor will disappear off of you and

appear on him and then he says oh

that's really good someone has already

activated the power of the armor oopsies

says it is not as effective as it could

be but I guess I will have to do any

picks you up goes over to the golem and

shoves you inside well and then the

hatch of the chest cavity sort of closes

around you paltin and you are stuff

inside the chest of the golem with the

burning flame oh my god I'm good like

I'm not claustrophobic and all the wait

I'm completely claustrophobic

all these arcane glyphs around you and

pokey bits sticking in your side and can

I cast sleep on myself and just hope I

sleep halten thing to do totally could

do that sure you have it doesn't you

automatically succeed because no matter

what you roll it will be more than one

hit point okay alright just gonna

pretend none of this is happening Mike

I'm safe I bearings how did you live

this long I don't know small ttan any of

us live this long

alright evylyn yeah uh so Duke zalto has

left his wife to find any more invisible

people umm Strix has run off DF isn't is

trapped in the duke's hammer what would

you like to do uh do i see the

mechanisms that could open the hammer

and let DF out uh

you know it's built into the haft of the

weapon but you can't really get at it

while the duke is holding it that's

unfortunate

yes it is

what yes Strix is laid out on oh yeah I

forgot with a cauldron to sort of

rolling on its side off of her so even

uh looks over at at D at that is about

to be like huh

and then notice this Turkson is like

beer at their lineup Lysander coming up

go over and lay on hands on her again

five five in points all right uh let's

see

next step is Strix your conscious again

when you look up you see the Duchess

looking down upon you I saw her big lady

take off running again alright uh let's

see she's close enough to you but she

could attempt an opportunity attack by

you just disengaging Missy sab okay

BAM and then you run off okay yes so

Strix disappears peers thirty feet

elsewhere and then runs off um the

Duchess not being a twit uh will take

her last pile of her last sack of flour

and spread it around where Strix was of

course laid on me big right on top of

your head you're just raining raining

and flower now evil isn't completely

revealed unlike the latter Lysander

shines she didn't expect to see a tiny

little person with flappy little wings

on boots hello I'm just playing in the

flower but I'm still invisible right so

I'm just like haha right she can see

your outline uh and then uh with her

last with her action she will attempt to

grab you good luck this is you have to

make an apple a strength olynyk's check

I like strength yes you do against hers

surely a tiny creature such as Jesus no

strength whatsoever

oh I hate these guys I was like oh I'm

not superstitious I don't actually have

sets of dice that actually are terrible

this side is actually terrible I'm never

using it again uh the Duchess will send

uh she will call out to her son who's

run off with her dad his dad calls him

salt Ember tells his all timber to go

get his sister there's so many you just

can't stop making another little fire

Jay it's getting all over the place and

uh she will bring you even though you're

invisible she can kind of see parts of

you because you're in flower now she'll

haul you up to her face and she says I

add some flour in her face you'll regret

that she says I am the Duchess of I am

slacking and I'm a paladin I love

Mahender not much longer your breath

stinks you might want to get that

checked out oh she is absolutely livid

at the sound of that you can see here

I'm just trying to help she add very

close up you can see that she wears a

crystal flask around her neck like a

pendant and the flask has a liquid sort

of bubbling around inside of it

and you can see she also has on her

other side some sort of rod or something

you're not sure what it is but it seems

to be made of painted gold and it's

quite large and long I say look look

look look look

lack like Tia said I'm sorry we're just

a band of dum-dums lost our little pets

and we just came in here looking for

them and now you guys think we're some

sort of agents of bad and I don't know I

just worshipped the gods Lysander and I

just want to spread his light everywhere

there's anything we can do to make it up

to you and I just like try to like like

what is that called

vomit yeah I try to filibuster this with

charisma like I did try to be like I try

to overwhelm her with my ability to just

like blah blah blah Alessandra blah blah

blah pets blah blah blah friends blah

blah blah all right when she takes you

into the kitchen you can see since most

of the goblins have vacated the only

other occupants you see other than the

retreating fire Giants are two ogres

wearing bloody aprons oh they're just

sort of standing in a corner waiting to

be commanded uh and the Duchess doesn't

pay them any mind you can also see what

looked like little imps made of smoke

playing in the hearth the kitchens large

hearth

how are those your kids they're real

cute do you have any pictures what are

their names

I'd love to meet them your other kids

seemed real nice look great today and

how old are they what do they like to do

what are their hobby quiet be quiet

I'll be quiet anyway thank you so much

for having us in your lovely house we

really uh would like to leave now though

it's off past my bedtime

all right ass boy okay so um annum innum

ennum where were we uh the iron golem

blah blah blah paltin is asleep doo doo

doo doo da ah so where has Zelda brought

me okay

good question so you've gone through the

kitchen exited through a couple doors

and then you turn right into a vast

chamber it's got what looks like a big

adamantine furnace it was this ginormous

flask shaped furnace between two cable

towers that support the bucket chain

overhead there are great pillars that

support the ceiling and iron gantries

clinging to the walls high above across

or hanging from the gantry's by cranes

you can see what appeared to be parts of

some enormous construct including a

pulsating adamantine heart about 20 feet

or sorry about 10 feet in diameter

and it seems to be illuminating this

large assembly hall you can also see

hanging from another crane what appears

to be a ginormous sword about 70 feet

long but what is attracting all eyes is

in the middle of this great assembly

hall some monstrous like possibly a

hundred foot tall construct has fallen

over having been released from its

chains and tumbled to the floor and is

sort of lying in pieces scattered upon

the floor behind that on the far side of

the room barely illuminated by the heart

you can see what appears to be a

gigantic set of doors and DF those can

only be the doors to the outside I did

it I have successfully recons mrs.

complete and as the fire Giants boil

into this room looking around for what

caused this Colossus to fall over

they're not seeing anything immediately

but you can see below you nuke salto

picks up something off the floor and

it's a ball made of iron bands it fits

in his hand almost like a toy and you

can see there's a charred skeleton

inside of it and he looks at it then

throws it over his shoulder Honka Honka

Honka Honka hung and he turns to the one

of the Giants and says where is gnar

Thorens Erebor where are my hounds I

don't know man he had nothing to do with

that um I would like to use this time

whilst he's distracted to once again

attempt an escape out of this mall ok so

give that another go here mass searching

13 uh

that doesn't work no no that's an action

uh you can see that he takes them all

and what's it sets it down headfirst so

the stick of them all is sticking

straight up over your head and you're

you know banged about dim as you land

but now you're basically on the floor in

the mall he's basically let you go

because he is thanks to me he's now sort

of looking at some of the fall and

wreckage and here his dog goes he's

looking for his dog goes okay uh while

that happens uh actually that was des

turn so Strix I'm great still human you

have fault you're basically following

the fire Giants into the assembly area

all right while I'm running I'm going to

alter myself and use alter self into a

goblin oh okay so I want to look like

one of the one of the cook goblins the

apron and everything alright um and

that's an action right yes that is just

a sprig Euler spell action yes right and

okay so you've changed your appearance

you are now a so it says you can't

appear as a creature of a different size

than you um sometimes I just I small so

be a big goblin okay okay all right

all for my age got it alright

you're an oversized goblin yep okay and

do you want to do anything else uh if I

see and put the hammer down or DFS I'll

just keep running that way you'll just

like hold some flour and just be like

I'm just trying to help like hop trying

to catch those catch those criminals

all right um one of the fire Giants sees

you and just not did not the Duke but

one of the other one sees you and says

get out I'll just be like well there

could be in Schrader's he pulls up his

sword get up they're invisible do you

want the odds of those scatter as I'm

running over the guy by yeah he's

starting to chase you out now

you're pretty sure goblins aren't

allowed in here sorry

Oh looking I'll stall come back okay uh

the Duchess even she has you um she

pulls a cauldron out of the fire and

says we have guests coming I have no

time for this and she drowns you in it I

do I can I easily so uh on her turn she

basically just immerses you into the

boiling hot stew that she's preparing ah

now I'm gonna let you try to make a

strength saving throw to sort of grab

the edges so you can't be pushed in to

the broth instead when she's saying that

kind I'm misty snap out of her hand it's

not your turn

technically yet so hang it okay fine I

need you to first make the stretcher

yeah I do I just not reason cuz you

always use it and I have floppy boots uh

strength saving thirty you son

yeah fourteen all right

yes she actually oh this is weird um

there's gonna be odd because the timing

um misty stuff is a bonus section not a

reaction so this is right yeah so she

takes you she dunks you in the boiling

hot water you take five points of fire

damage

as you are immersed and you are now

being held in the boiling broth now your

turn is going to come around soon but

while you're in the broth you can't see

because a you're in the cauldron and the

broth is opaque and

when you cast misty step you know that

you only you can only teleport to a

space that you can see right so I have

to like fight my head above yes so you

have to try to use your move to escape

Oh kitty in the background uh to escape

from her grasp right which you can use

either strength or dexterity strength

epileptics or dexterity acrobatics and I

can't like see just outside her fist in

the stew no okay just checking

yep nice cauldron is pretty big here in

your tiny yeah I'm gonna do string okay

well you might succeed she rolled badly

I got a 13 alright you are successful

you managed to squirm out of her grip

and surface in the ball by the way

because you started your turn in the

cauldron you take another five hit

points of damage okay

I think in my head I look like you know

that scene in The Little Mermaid where

she pops above water in your hair like

blue but actually what I look like is

like covered and stuff and but as soon

as I open my eyes I go and just like 30

feet up in the air okay away alright I

start trying to fly toward my friends as

much as I can right so I when you do

that she is momentarily confused she's

exactly sure where you are but she

tracks you pretty quickly because seeing

a weirdly flying creature is not that

hard

covered in stew and - - dripping and the

ogres are pointing the door um

[Music]

and she's like how all right um so Strix

as you are chased out uh or dafuc Strix

get chased earth you see a weird looking

goblin get chased out of it something

area and yeah because it looks kinda

like Strix you're able to figure out

pretty quickly her I can tell the

districts yes okay

it's a Strix Ian goblin alright she's so

smart

yeah uh and the you can hear the Duke

bellowing you can hear the Giants

picking through the wreckage trying to

find out what happened you also hear the

Duke calling out the names of the sounds

alright so this is it's my turn then yep

alright so well now that I'm on the

ground I'm gonna try and do so is the

best time to get out of this cage so I'm

like we'll try to do that okay make a

check alright still a disadvantage

nope regular nope yeah Oh natural 20

cruel market alright finally some luck

at you cause the doors on both sides of

the hammer to spring open alright no I -

okay I was like kind of stumble out a

little bit I'm like ah no for like

staring down just stone like hyper

fighting a little bit and then just like

just a brief moment I click myself and

then like it's finally like a snap back

up and I come back to action um I'm

really finding like the closest thing to

whatever it is to stealth or hide behind

district' see me do all this uh yes

right good then she'll see where I'm

going to go so whatever is in your bar

that I can really hide behind so if you

want to stay on this level you could

hide behind one of the support create

one of the support towers for the bucket

chain or you could climb up into it and

try to hide higher up like nearer to the

bucket chain the other option is on this

floor you can hide behind the big flask

like adamantine Forge that dominates one

end of the room it's about 55 60 feet

cross and about 60 feet tall I'm so

easily easy to hide behind right but you

said the bucket chain itself is no

longer moving it's it's not operational

currently it's just hanging it's just

static alright I'm just going to try to

hide behind one of these support our Sun

uh okay

there doesn't seem to the only way up to

what appears to be the iron gantries is

a stearic is a giant sized staircase on

the far side of the room you're pretty

sure you can't get there anytime soon is

it similar to the one that we use to get

to the lower level

yes invisible okay yeah that's probably

not okay idea and then back you strix is

near the doors to the assembly area I'm

heading back toward the kitchen those

are open you could also hide technically

behind one of those doors if you wanted

uh I'm gonna I'm gonna make my way over

to stress okay all right so Strix d/f

has returned in battle action mode you

two were together uh and it's your turn

what would you like to do yeah um okay

we didn't fight evil indeed fine Bolton

we did yeah yes we do believe I'm still

strong enough to push the door open

excellent so we need to open the door

first only assume hold this summary Oh

Strix I forgot something

make a Arcana check for me oh my god I'm

nineteen um this maybe this this is just

worth noting it doesn't change anything

but when you were in the room in the

assembly area among the things you saw

hanging from the cranes was the APRA

mentioned Hart right this pulsating

magical 10-foot diameter looks like a

human heart but of enormous scale and

obviously fashioned for a construct of

enormous size yeah well your if Chris

wants us to interact with that heart I

mention it because it's clearly a very

powerful magical device right yeah and

with your roll you believe that that

without back

piece that construct will never work

oh that's important so in its high up it

could be like no not down yeah

it's hanging it's hanging fifty feet

above the floor by an iron crane mounted

to a gantry cool I'll relay their dream

oh you like that idea and um yeah I mean

technically if we find evil and she

could get it down what's the the the

thing that's supporting the heart up the

whole thing itself is made of iron yeah

so on one of the iron gantry's there's a

crane protruding from it with a big

chain hanging from it and the heart is

hanging from the chain by a mechanism

essentially a locking mechanism mm a

locking mechanism huh yeah so it could

be unlocked theoretically yes all right

you don't have any way of getting me up

there do you I do have a way of getting

you up there I can turn you into a cloud

and you can get up there and then I can

tell then I you give me a signal and I

will uncloudy you like wave a cloud hand

from on top of the heart uh not bad you

can get down

you're nimble yeah it's getting away

part it's gonna be tough one for now

while you do that I'll go up with the

door right why Bell evylyn in Bolton we

don't have much time they'll catch up to

us

this big noise just happened it'll be

fine all right like all he said that's

palton and evil and his I don't know

she's she was invisible it wouldn't even

see her anyway we didn't see her get

covered with flowers so we when you fly

you fly into view you emerge from the

kitchen into the hallway beyond and you

see goblins tricks and DF below you and

she got a snack awesome my gosh she is

what's up friends you see evil is just

dripping great good to see you I miss

you when are you okay I'm gonna send you

up there dance just do it and evylyn I'm

gonna yell captured if he falls evil and

you know the Duchess is coming after you

okay we've got

ah but I also go toward that heart and

I'm like this might be our leverage guys

okay I'm hovering up there where death

is going to be I'm also holding my act

like I won't be able that you won't be

able to get that far this round how come

you can get toward it about half the

distance okay okay

all right do you want me to cloud you do

you um I'm clouded I move slow yeah uh

you do ten feet around that's that's

pretty slow that's dead slow yeah yeah

Strix DFU here um from the hallway that

somewhere deeper down the hallway that

you've entered there's like a there's a

way to the kitchen right to your left

right there there's the kitchen but then

the hallway goes off toward the right

into darkness you hear some sort of

magical popping sound and then the sound

of iron footsteps coming toward you oh

geez

everything is awful alright yeah even

you know coming over like I I feel like

I trust her more to do this successfully

than I will I'll point over that heart

using information gained from Strix like

putting out that heart

evylyn break it her eyes just turn into

little stars hmm

hard as you can uh breaks it up starts

playing yeah Strix you get to that door

you get it open I'm gonna go find

Paulding at the crash singing as you say

that she's already ten feet ahead of you

running like yes that's like a command

order you like strict as you Ori

okay so DF you're running where uh like

the stuff that I kind of fell down made

this loud sound yeah I believe paltin is

over there so I'm gonna start like

sneaking my way over to that area to

find out him take a stealth check for me

dawn

evylyn you fly up to the heart and

you're like in a holding pattern

Strix you're going me to smash it okay

yeah okay so what did you roll on your

stealth 21 okay and Strix where did you

run to uh I'm going to run towards the

door and I'm still in goblin form so I'm

still gonna pretend to be like who I'm

good I'm looking for bad guys haha okay

so you're just hanging out by the the

doors that you came through is that

right right now but I'm trying to run

towards the front door Oh like a cross

okay yeah um even even though that fire

giant school did you last time well do I

see him Mike do I see like out like a

picture up here after EFD thought he

chased you out he sort of went back to

help with searching for the dogs yeah oh

yeah I'm definitely I'm just gonna I'm

just gonna coal I'll have you make a

stealth check as well oh wow oh gosh

well my role the one okay can we just do

something right for once

alright just now are you silly evylyn uh

you can are you gonna use light fall on

me so what's the what's the lay of the

land the duchess is like right behind me

right yeah so you can see that she

something must have delayed her because

she is not she hasn't currently shown up

you would have expected to see her by

now okay so there's no impending danger

to my friends they're just making a

break for the exit right that is correct

all the other fire Giants are distracted

looking through the rubble of the car

lot of the Colossus of the Fallen

Colossus so I I was kind of looking back

to the Duchess like ready to kind of but

make it reception make a perception

check to see if you notice her or

anything else it's a one okay that's a

one this doesn't mean our old me a

couple ones

do we all right rubble Wisel decide it's

not fair this one was wrong the way they

died but anyway so I kind of like look

behind me over my shoulder cuz I was

excited to to you know taunt the Duchess

basically but then I kind of like and

then I go into slow-mo and I do a like

massive spinning light fall strike and

in the in the middle of the slow-mo

there's like a hair flip and like a

little

blonde curls covered in stew flip like

dew off of them and just won't connect

with it and also I got attack role okay

does it do that animating or like red

the hair flip like the background some

because like pink and flowery and here

you're kind of boom you're trying to hit

the heart itself right a big pulsating

heart - yeah I I would hit the chains to

make it fall and break but evil ins just

gonna just right for the global Center

yeah all right and my attack role gives

me a 19 all right

you hit the heart and when you do there

is a reverberation through your weapon

and light fall explodes oh and you're

left holding like just the charred kid

bit of the handle you actually have

never heard evil and scream before but

it is a blood-curdling unnatural scream

he and she is so shocked she kind of

begins to like she just falls back in

his motionless in the air staring at

this heart okay Strix make a perception

check 14 okay and DF make a perception

check you of course all of you see the

destruction address of the acts 18 okay

DF you can see where a giant is

currently sort of peeling back rubble a

tiny baby owl bear hiding in the shadows

of of the wreckage just hoping not to be

seen but you see the next piece that the

giant about the liftoff will completely

expose her Oh app Alton you are jostled

awake when your sleep spell wears off oh

uh and uh I'm gonna have you make a

comment check for mirror and

intelligence Arcana check or just

intelligence if you don't have our conic

but I think you do ah I don't know you

don't know you're just okay so thirteen

okay you do know by the way

no you're contained in here that's high

enough to know how you would open up the

compartment if you ever wanted to get

out but you can feel that the the the

golem is like jogging you're like inside

like cool and then it sort of comes to a

kind of skidding stop you here and just

sort your face like being slammed up

against a panel shuttle does you want to

do anything now that you're awake are

you just gonna hang out in here it's

warm in here so uh it is very hot in

here you are just sweating buckets cuz

the flame is with you oh I so can I like

look out at all no you don't open up the

chest cavity to even look out I don't

like anything that's going on out there

no you hear a horrible shriek like an

unearthly sound almost and you think

it's evil and it's like ah that's

probably bad yeah it's like it's it's

the sound you'd expect her to make in

the instant before she was cloven and -

just like I should check on that should
