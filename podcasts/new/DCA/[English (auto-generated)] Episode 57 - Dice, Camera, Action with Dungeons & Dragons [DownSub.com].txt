hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action that's good to be back back we're

back in burrow via when last we left the

waffle crew they got dragged unwillingly

back into the dark realm of burrow via

by stroll ttan or rather Paul Tain's

shadow possessed by a fragment of

strawed and in just before the wedding

was about to unfold and paltin was to

give his wedding vows things went awry

when murti Kirti AKA morton canaan and a

bunch of burro vien mob and his market a

bunch of others crashed the wedding then

everything went to hell and palton took

out the sun sword and jammed it into the

shadow of the shadow of Stratton

obliterating it casting away the last

remnant of straw from the domain forever

and somehow for some reason the waffle

crew got shunted back in time to a time

specifically when Castle Ravenloft is

kinda new and there is another wedding

about to transpire this one between

Tatiana and Sergei strods brother this

is the very wedding that straud

destroyed that set burro via on its dark

path the waffle crew was originally

divided Strix and DF got a chance to

talk to Tatiana and paltin and even got

to meet Dutchess Dorf Nia delays Nia a

guest of the wedding who brought for

Sergei and Tatiana a rather unusual gift

which palton and evil and decided they

were going to unwrap and when they did

they discovered simon AKA murder bot yes

lost their time and this puppet

proceeded to shoot poison darts into Tok

his neck in a twice foiled attempt to

kill her she would have died had evylyn

not been on hand to cast revivify as a

matter of fact that's it right Strix saw

strods desk in his study cards left

behind by a young vez Thani woman named

Katarina who may in fact be Madame Ava

from a different age several of those

cards indicated or suggested waffle crew

and in the middle of those four cards

representing members of the waffle crew

who was a fifth card called the healer

no idea what that means but Strix did

not see and deaath later discovered

three cards that had been cast down on

to the floor those cards are the tempter

and the marionette and the executioner

and at the end of last week's session

there was a thought that these cards

might in some way refer to the Duchess

and your little your son your murderous

little son her twice he's a good boy

he's just confused and one final detail

paltin came into possession of a cool

new musical mandolin which appears to

have great magic inside it and he got

that off of an individual who looked

somewhat like him perhaps an ancestor of

some kind named yes / both yes / and

Catarina and were nowhere to be seen at

the end of last week's session we're

gonna jump a little bit ahead tonight

and say you guys are at or you guys can

decide if you want to be here or not but

we are at the time of day now where

Strada and his brother are back at the

castle and dinner has been laid out and

strawed is serving as host to this

dinner and paltin whom the staff has

been led to believe is the Bard of

Buress is going to perform at this

dinner don't laugh now the rest of you

at various times been mistaken for

members of both the Duchess's staff and

the House staff so first let's talk

about the dinner is this something you

guys would want to participate in or you

going to try to avoid it evylyn

definitely is still just pretending to

be like oh I think we don't want to

separate and also I have to make Sergei

a man again because right now he's a

mouse that's right

yes when Sergey and Tatiana came up to

the study looking for some private time

you interrupted them you filled their

heads with crazy thoughts yet actually

showed Tatiana the tome of straud

written in the future in strods hand in

human blood that told of all the

horrible horrible things he did at the

wedding and thereafter and then yes

u-turns Sergei into a mouse so also just

thinking if we fix things will the

writing in the book disappear like Back

to the Future

mm-hmm who knows so what do you want to

do with Sergei I didn't mean to keep him

a mouse I just want him to know that I

know magic okay

I've imagined even as a mouse he was

able to understand the things that were

saying at the time so even he knows

what's up with straw and everything yeah

from the dinner yeah I think das would

not want to be played how long - least a

nearby

palton yeah should something go awry

he's at least nearby them and I will

definitely also cast deaf ward again on

Sergei so on Sergei and I believe if I

have enough

what level is it one is new for me does

it require concentration I don't know

actually

so that's a new one so that's word nope

it does not so yes you can cast as often

you like on the many people as you like

as long as you have the songs to do it

alright I am going to cast that on

Tatiana and Sergei I think I did it on

time down again last time do they both

have that yes so you've cast that spell

now three times in the past five minutes

yes and that will last well through the

dinner okay well now that you have

shared this information with Tatiana and

Sergei the first thing that you realize

is that they're aghast and horrified and

I'd like you all to make insight checks

I've been yelling too much 6 ok ok so

three of you think that yeah you you

scared them real good

d/f you can tell that based on the

insight is that the two of them are

probably going to go to the dinner but

there it's clear in your mind that there

have serious thoughts about their their

life span here in the castle even what

the benefit of Strix is Magic you you

sense a flight instinct kicking in yeah

you think that they might bolt if given

an opportunity to do so great go be free

when not that we're not we're not bound

by the promises that they've made to be

at the dinner and all that kind of stuff

it would be hard for them to slip away

under daylight oh they can't leave at

night

[Laughter]

all right so those of you who are not

paltin how would you how so that you

know or you find out that the dinner is

going to be held downstairs in the large

dining room with the pipe organ on the

ground floor not too far from the main

foyer and the entrance to the castle and

it's a dead end room with a big table

lots of chairs you know straw it's going

to be there the bride and the groom are

going to be there potentially other

guests likely a guard or two as well as

servants going in and out there's going

to be a corner where the musician the

the bard

can perform near the pipe organ and how

do you guys want to you don't have seats

at the table let me put it that way

right oh well we were already mistaken

earlier for other servants yeah you were

mistaken for other servants either of

the Duchess who's visiting and brought

her own entourage and/or servants of the

castle but that's that's confusion among

really I mean rah-rah Hadean thought you

were with the Duchess other castle

servants thought you were with the

Duchess but the Duchess is going to be

at the dinner do know from experience

evylyn and paltin that the Duchess does

not look servants in the I know so many

so I I would believe it best death would

basically kind of keep up this rod if

for another reason that uh Tatyana

believes him to be so if he keeps this

up he can kind of a little bit okay so

whatever in that case tasks he can do to

fake it if you're about are you going to

then tell Tatiana that you're going to

be there

yep okay so in that place she will

conspire with you to get you some

servant uniforms yeah conspire okay

great so awesome now you can't just wear

those over armor because you jerks can

definitely wear it over her garbage

though

yeah but not over your mathy but big

black moth-eaten robe oh that's true

okay so can I at least make the leather

armor itself and this hand over my okay

so I won't be having the leather armor

on so I will lose okay but yeah

everything if you all need me to hold

something for you I got a free

compartment right here so water milk in

it but that's all cleaned up yeah well

like okay so if there's a bard as the

bard like get some extra wristbands or

something like that no no you do some

investigating the only thing you're able

to you're you're you're entitled to is a

small pouch of coins but you don't think

anybody would protest if you had a small

animated dancing sidekick dressed just

like a gesture or a paladin alright but

again I need to point out the Duchess is

going to be at the dinner and Simon is

her present to the unwed couple time

indeed

wait Simon's here right yeah like do you

have any disguises he'll look around the

room no study that you're into see if

there's anything he like points to a

tapestry and then he points to like a

fireplace it'll go over to the fireplace

and he'll take handfuls of soot

and just know like paint like a

jack-o'-lantern like face and then he

looks at you like he's completely

different actually I asked Strix I'm

like you're real good with making stuff

can you make that curtain into a nice

little cloak for searches just like have

you not seen that he put his spooky face

on he's adorable

[Laughter]

I history is repeating itself alright

now we know there might have been that

yeah great it's all our fault

so take the tapestry down Tyus and try

and just like fashion him some sort of

little outfit with it okay yeah you have

a few hours to kill to do that cool

awesome it can also make him with like

some old hair or something from my robe

make him like a little wig - oh can you

make matching one that we could be like

a a mother-son act just doesn't say

anything as soon as I heard all right so

yeah so you can just have a wig that

sort of pulls over his jester's cap sort

of a big poofy thing looks likes tricks

his hair yeah perfect

actually touch I could probably give him

a big she's got a couple of wigs that

were given to her as gift she could give

him one of those like a big blond curly

lock wig yeah all right so just Strix in

terms of your costume making skills just

make a let's call it a wisdom check

alright I got a 10 ok that's perfect you

fan you fashioned a perfectly

serviceable

costume all right great doesn't look

like it's gonna fall off or do anything

weird cool

I'm so glad just keep making eyes at

death while I'm doing it like no evil

then are you gonna go as one of the

servants you're gonna go as a sort of a

dancer for The Bard

yeah I'm definitely the backup dancer

slash promoter

part of part of Marez ballyhoo also I

decided I'm not going to dress up as a

servant I'm just gonna be a cloud oh

okay I'm just gonna be a little a little

cloud of mist drifting around the floor

okay special effects when I dance you

could like whirl around and stuff sure

Joubert see the special effects that

will be my role also she just doesn't

want to give away her staff room or any

poisonous plants that she could put in

people's food Evelyn's all like she can

like hold the instruments she can be

like the cool animated like instrument

stand this is no just I know you got a

fog machine laser lightshow wait I do

have a laser light show I say no don't I

can use a at least minor illusion or

prestidigitation gonna make some

sparkles if you guys want you can you

blend your drift globes you could rig

with it yes no that's mine all right

well I will yeah sure I'll use minor

illusion or to give I guess like to give

evil in some like anime sparkles and

called some anime sparkles or something

all right

so the Chamberlain raha Dean will usher

you downstairs

Paul Timmy only rest we still you could

while while the costuming is being made

and stuff you can take a short rest oh

so you do that yeah you can spend your

hit dice to gain back hit points and I

would love to do all right yeah still

and as the healers I suggest that you

all do that too yeah

the Chamberlain will lead you down

without saying a word other than to

follow them again Paul Finn you're a

little unnerved because every time you

see Rahad and you expect to hear the

screams of a thousand souls around him

I just keep like leaning amorously no no

nothing huh is there something wrong no

you know you keep saying a scream of a

thousand voices about how many people

are coming to his wedding give or take

oh you know a few hundred okay nor even

no reasons all right you're led down

into the big room now the last time you

were here paulten the pipe organ that

dominated the back wall of the banquet

hall was kind of a ghastly thing it it

had sort of a combination of these

cherubs carved into its sides but then

the actual pipes of the organ kind of

had a demonic cast now those pipes look

completely different and the entire

thing has sort of an angelic quality and

it's all shiny and new no cobwebs or

dust here the table has all been set

there are servants running around

frantically raha joints to a corner for

you to stand in and then rolls his eyes

at your entourage as you and they walk

past and then he goes off to deal with

other matters so while you're just

setting up and you've got a stool to sit

on to you can tune your instrument or

whatever and you're your two marionettes

are standing next to you and Strix is a

cloud around your feet

I'm gonna be awesome now Strix when you

start casting your other spells you

can't do that as a cloud right right now

I can't you have to stand behind paltin

and right yeah I'm I'm sure I can do

that mm-hmm yes so as you as the day

wears on in DFU sort of meld into the

throng of servants moving back and forth

getting things ready and then people

start to move into the into the banquet

hall to sit down and one of the first to

show up is the Duchess and you can CDF

as you're crossing a hall with a plate

of biscuits that the Duchess is speaking

to one of the castle guards it is the

same it looks like the same man who was

on horseback with Strada and Sergei when

they arrived at the castle but he's got

his helm off now tucked under one arm

and the manner in which they are

speaking to each other

suggests intimate familiarity and this

is not rowdy this is not raha Dean this

is a this is a castle guard captain

talking to a guest the Duchess am I able

to I would like to attempt to fake some

kind of service duties to get your shot

of that sure just make a stealth check

to lose yourself in the room there are

pillars and things you can stand behind

as well so you have I'm gonna say of

advantage all right as you stand in

eavesdrop on the conversation what you

learn is that the man's name is Leo he's

he's tall about 6-3 long black hair a

black mustache and goatee he the Duchess

is his mother

and she is saying that she will she has

made arrangements with the servants to

leave the present in the room for the

bride and groom to discover later but if

things go wrong

he and his loyal guards need to step in

and take them out got it all right and

she says in in no uncertain terms this

wedding this marriage cannot be allowed

to survive okay okay

and then she he leans in so she can kiss

him on the cheek she kisses him on the

other cheek and then Pat Summitt's boy

Pat's him on the cheek on the shoulders

and tells him he's always been a good

boy and based on I make an inside check

for me again it's a natural one okay

you can't you can't get a good read on

Leo he doesn't talk much you don't know

what his feelings are toward his mother

or his loyal whether this is even an

issue of loyalty for him you get no read

really on him whatsoever he strikes you

as a veteran soldier who is seen more

than his share of bloodshed under strods

command there's just sort of a hard edge

to him that's a little hard to really

for you to grok all right

and they they split up the Duchess goes

to their to the banquet hall and when

she enters the room a servant is there

waiting for her to direct her to one end

of the table so she gets an end seat

with her back to the doors leading out

of the banquet hall which means she will

be directly across from straud who will

be at the opposite end his chair is

being brought in now and set at the end

of the table you can see it's far

grander than anything else here as you

move back and forth d/f and as the as

the band is getting set the doors open

and strawed enters raha Dean following

him to his chair and then not too long

thereafter the bride and groom enter

they are led by different servants the

bride by two women and the groom by two

men and they are ushered to their seats

on each side of straud so they're

sitting at one end to the three of them

and then the Duchess is sitting at the

far end by herself all of the other

chairs are empty

hmm all right is the is the band set up

or set it it is set up okay

so Paul them didn't even know them were

up there yep alright and you see the

Duchess periodically casts a glance

toward them because they're kind of

making a noise and they're obviously

drawing there's something about them

that attracts the eye I don't know what

but she does not seem to recognize Simon

good is there wine in the vicinity there

is copious amounts of wine on the table

fantastic and the servants are are

filling up the the big wine glasses of

all of the guests that have arrived so

far the Duchess asks the Chamberlain

where are the other guests and the

Chamberlain says none were invited rude

and then she said then she says well I

was invited and rah-rah Hadean says

actually you weren't and then he leaves

we all over here this yes everybody here

in the room can hear this and you see

the Duchess she gets all uptight and she

puts her chest out a bit and sort of

under her breath says why never but you

can see clearly and you know her well

enough that she invited herself

MIBs midship I heard them like but raha

Deena's having none of it and he lacks

the DS has all the decorum of a soldier

who

you know has never never really trucked

with parties of any kind so when you are

now all of you in the servants who come

and go are basically in the room alone

with strong the Duchess and the bride

and the groom and yes because Sergey and

Tatiana are now scared to death of

strong thanks to you they're sitting in

silence staring at each other and just

drinking copious amounts of wine and

their attendants can sense the

awkwardness and strawed is kind of

slumped back in his chair on cloud under

the table sure

yeah just under the table make a stealth

check for me great oh that's not bad

17 yeah you're able to drift under the

table that anybody even noticing great

so she's gonna use her her mage hand to

take one of her like poisonous plants

and try and just like drop it into

strawed soup she's also gonna try and

like make eyes hopefully it like able

and impulse and like start playing like

wait actually she'll wait until they

start playing if I start playing and

like once they start their music

realizing there's some discomfort

strawed will just sort of snap his

fingers into palton oh

[Laughter]

he does it again gives you an angry

glare I will start playing the my fancy

new mandolin all right it plays

beautifully it it doesn't require any

tuning or anything

perfect evylyn is supposed to be like

dancing and stuff but she gets so

excited by this that she's just staring

at positive like meanwhile Simon's like

actually just just before she's gonna

just before she's gonna put it into

strods she's gonna like mash it up a

little bit I'm just like getting it all

like squished poisonin all right

so make another stealth check Holly for

your range hand to do this

surreptitiously do I do I say like she's

doing she's up to something yeah would I

be able to like seamlessly while I'm

playing give her a Bartok inspiration

you sure can take a roll and a d12

like working it into free bird that's so

nice yeah and to free bird oh man this

is a terrible idea

I'm sorry Strix is so dumb she can't

really help great maybe it'll kill

Strada and all our problems will be

solved yeah it works it worked last time

okay so that's 11 plus 11

so okay very good yeah mccannon do you

have make an inside job okay all right

so after she does that at some point

about a minute later after while

everybody's listening to the music being

played in the hall Estrada picks up the

bowl dumps it on the floor and puts it

back on the table

damnit but doesn't say or do anything

else he just doesn't like soup that's

all and then some service some servants

come in and they start to wipe up the

floor and one of them peeks under the

table sees you there and she just stares

like she's never seen a devil woman

under a table before as she's staring

actually staring it's fine I'm just

gonna use a oh wait what do I hit oh

darn it's too late screaming really

scream alright so cloud strikes comes

out from underneath the table oh my god

the clouds continues under a door so no

lady yeah there's one set of door

there's a double door that leads out of

the banquet hall out into the grand

foyer it's the only exit you're aware of

okay I'll just go

can I go wherever raha Dean came from

yes that's where you went okay perfect

okay

as you skirt off in that direction and

actually by this time everybody is

watching you as you drift out things are

going so well play louder and the door

you can slip right underneath the doors

Strix and leave the room okay and I get

to the other side yes you are now beside

the doors that's when you notice that

raha Dean and some servants are waiting

out in the hall you can send that the

servants are carrying things one two of

them have what appears to be an iron

odd okay with a tapestry wrapped around

it and two more have what appeared to be

a big something on wheels were covered

with a drape which you think is some

sort of picture because of its shape

it's big rectangular shape Oh

and so when you drift out in your cloud

form raha Dean and the servants look at

you and raha Dean just puts his hands on

his on his hand on his scimitar cool can

I just go like this and just go run away

to distract him yes I mean sort of drift

up a staircase and disappear yes perfect

yes he will follow you

great okay aha missed that part of

history up here I go

the Duchess meanwhile in the room looks

across the table at sat and says she's

not one of mine and gets no response

from strata they'll grab right at the

groom this whole time dear this is my

servant outfit off to sidecar like hands

in front of them just alright stride

again snaps his fingers a servant goes

to open the doors and in comes the four

servants carrying the things and then he

says two he holds his hands out to

Tatiana and Sergei takes them both by

the hands tight grip around each and

says I have but a gift for each of you a

wedding present

and then he gestures to the servants and

they put the metal the iron rod onto a

set of hooks and then with ropes hoist

them up the wall and as they do the

tapestry comes unfurled and throught

says

for you my brother the memory of our

father and you see on the tapestry an

image of soldiers charging across a

battlefield on horses led by a general

on a big big black stallion with a

visored helm on shaped like a wolf a

wolf's head and he's holding out a sword

a blazing sword with a radiant blade you

actually paltin has seen this tapestry

before when he was led up out of the

dungeons but it was much older mafi and

decrepit and hanging in a back staircase

completely in a non prominent position

oh and yes this is the sense of okay

yeah and paltin when you saw this

tapestry before raha Dean told you that

this was a depiction of the wolf King

King bear off von czarevitch cool yes

and Sergey yeah sorry even is very

uncomfortable with straw touching both

Sergei both of them because this is what

we were trying to prevent so she's still

kind of dancing and she starts doing

little sides like like not even looking

at them just robot staring ahead just

trying to get as close as possible to

prevent any sudden death got it okay

when Sergei looks at the tapestry you

can see a look of you know goes as far

as to say fear but discomfort here is a

young man who like his older brother

never had to go to war and given his

sort of stronger ties to the church

there's there's something about this

image that causes him some distress or

just makes him uncomfortable

can I tell why that might be consider

you can make an insight check yeah okay

17 you think that Sergey is a man of

peace a servant of the morning Lord

preserver of life that maybe he never

really saw never really understood his

father who was a conqueror a butcher a

very vicious tyrant of a man perhaps in

his eyes and that his that his brother

is giving this to him as a wedding gift

is meant to tell him this is who we are

and this is who we have to be and that

doesn't sit well with Sergey okay on the

other side of the room the two servants

role in what you assumed to be the large

framed portrait of whatever and as the

sheet is pulled away on strods command

you see it is a portrait of Tatiana the

same one that in futures told will grace

the mantle above the fireplace in strods

study and he says to her never can an

artist capture your beauty but this one

tried his best before the end yeah and

you can see the implied thing there is

that the artist did not survive and he

says kind of like looking at death and

paltin like like are we gonna do this

like are we gonna and Tatiana looks at

her image which is far larger than even

she is I mean the painting is taller

than she is and it's its ornate wooden

frame that it sits in it's stunningly

beautiful and it's sort of captured her

captures her in a almost doll-like way

there's no life really staring back at

her through those eyes

Astrix lost all Hadean yet so strictly

there are plenty of places where a

gaseous person can sort of slip away yes

you think you've called him great

she wants to go because I'm sure did you

tell her that there were soldiers trying

to kill Sarah Gannon Tatiana mmm did I

have time to no no you didn't okay

all right well then she's just gonna

make her way back to the dining room

because she just wanted to lose Rama

Dean and get him do not go in there

but she's going to not ideally she would

just de cloud outside and just like or D

cloud above the table and just kind of

like sit on her broom

oh so mom so you're gonna make your way

back to the banquet hall first thing

right yeah

probably by different route right

exactly hopefully a blaster I'll make a

perception check okay to see how well

you make your way through the castle bad

I got a 16 all right the castle isn't

nearly as perplexing to you as it has

been in the past

let's get lost quite so much as you're

making your way back down by another

route you sort of pass what you believe

to be the throne hall and you head down

a foyer and then to the grand staircase

leading down to the the ground-floor

Hall you do also see you you look like

you'll have to pass by or wait for him

to pass by you that blond-haired did you

see him yes you did you saw you saw up

Alton's yes yeah you see him making his

way downstairs by himself and you can

see that since last you saw him he is

donned riding clothes and it's got a

cloak on with sort of a high collar and

is making his way downstairs and trying

to be quiet about it you see him stop at

one point and watch two servants leave

before he heads down into

main hall perfect I'm gonna go ahead an

unclouded and then if I can use alter

self to turn into raha Dean okay does he

have a Swedish accent just making

probably all right do you say anything

when you appear because he is originally

yes to see you there

well momentarily shocked yes you do that

okay

he knows that raha Dean is very soft on

his feet so yeah so I'll just looking at

me like where are you going yes / make a

deception jack my god oh I'm pretty good

at this hold on 21 okay oh very

convincing no oh great I was look at him

really maybe like I don't believe you he

says and he kind of gets real nervous

and you can tell he's not a great liar

but and then he said and then suddenly

it's like something somebody told him

once if he ever found himself in danger

he should do this he's suddenly very

boldly steps toward you and says I am

avestan II your Lord and Master he would

never harm us nor can you go about your

wedding business I have business of my

own

it's just gonna bake break character and

be like okay this logic isn't working so

you shocked again hi I know magic I

don't really want to waste this spell

though so I'm just gonna stay as raha

Dean right now hi my name is strict it's

like cigar hand out to shake his hand

he'll take your hand okay I know this is

weird but I'll still like pull out

stinky and be like this is my rat see

I'm I'm not as katarina told me about

you oh thank you oh good I don't really

don't know waste the spell I have a plan

for it but where are you going really

sorry to scare you haha he says I'm

going to the carriage house it's outside

is it to help people he says maybe

because the Duchess is bad stron is bad

we've been just from the army is bad

it's all bad can we just like your

another sword who can help us I just if

you leave maybe early are you leaving to

get more help

he says I'm preparing a coach I just

assumed nobody knew about it I blah I

mean oh but we need help you need to

help us I tried to poison straw it

didn't work he spit it out he's he's

probably already a vampire he says it's

not my job to worry about strong but I

do want to make sure that the bride and

groom don't get hurt by him that's it

that's what I want in that's what I

wanted to hear you go about your

business then can I Amy says he says can

you keep a secret

I the best that I can

he says they came to me they fear for

their lives so I'm going to get them out

of here if you take them out of here

they will die dark places bad he says

that is not what Katharina tells me

there will be safest with me she said

that was their only hope she saw it in

the cards

Strix that's like think about this for a

second she's like holding up her hands

like oh okay great you keep doing that

I'll keep a secret

I'm gonna go pretend to be this scary

crazy face upstairs and try and get the

Dutchess distracted and strong if Ryan

finds out what you're doing he will kill

you he already tried so doesn't really

matter he takes a swig of wine you

remind me of my friend paltin I'm good

and then he leaves okay everything all

right this is fine everything's fine

everything is fine and then she'll walk

up to the doors all right well I'm gonna

flip back to the other room for a second

here that's good

Tatiana leans into straw and says thank

you it's beautiful and then sort of

settles back into her chair and fingers

sort of plate runs her finger across the

the base of her wine glass it's clear

based on body language this is a very

uncomfortable situation what I was kind

of casting looks at palton India did

either of you guys give any indication

of anything that you guys wanted to do

nope all of death is really doing is

just trying to stay nearby talk to Jana

and Sergei so if some reason they leave

he will feign servant duties to be like

I will assist you or whatever

strawed will turn to you palton and say

stop it's like

and strawed turns to his turn to the

bride and groom and says I have one more

gift for you if one just keeps dancing

and there's that awkward moment like

that the bride and the groom actually

think that this is the moment he reaches

down to his sword and takes it off and

lays it across his chair the arms of his

chair and then with a bit of a flourish

steps behind the chair and grows over to

the pipe organ and begin sits himself

down in front of it cracks his knuckles

and begins to play is it nice it's a

song you've never heard before

and you can tell as it unfolds that it

is simply elegantly amazingly beautiful

to see a monster such as him this

butcher general this shadow of his

father performed something so

breathtakingly full of love is

disconcerting this is this is something

that you think he wrote for his bride

even like stops dancing despite herself

and it's just kind of like overcome yeah

it's it just melts that little tin heart

of yours everyone paying attention to

this organ playing right now yes

Paulding is like drunk sobbing at it Oh

how long is drawed sword would you say

it's it's a good size it's like four and

a half feet long oh no okay and you can

see he's he is totally engulfed in the

music in this moment you can see tears

begin to well in Tatiana's eyes but

Sergei you see him his brow sort of

furrow a bit alright so quick glance

around

is there anything nearby that say has a

decent amount of width but it's a give

or take four and a half feet tall

there's like standing candlesticks

around the room of varying heights some

near the walls that are about that tall

great deus leaps forward and tries to

swipe the sword while everyone is like

paying attention to the music he's just

lean forward just so since the pipe

organ is right behind sort of behind

struts chair truss rod chair is

basically between the dining table and

the pipe organ you will be moving into

the view of the others oh damn okay

they're mine I thought I was off to the

side no yeah I don't want the Duchess

seeing this now if you wanted to really

get it there is a way to do it and you'd

have to pull ass tricks you have to

somehow basically slink under the table

and then come up under the table and

pull it down underneath Strix would do

this I'm in alright so to prevent the

Duchess from seeing it you kind of have

to go under her chair throw through her

legs

down the length of the table and then up

into strods chair but yeah I move over

to checker to bring to see if she needs

it and then I see she's fine I'm like

okay it disappeared behind her chair

walk around behind I'm just alright make

a stealth check okay I'm gonna give you

advantage because they are and wrapped

by strods performance okay you do it so

effortlessly even though even the

servants don't even they don't even

knowing you're gone

right all right and you Fleet Feet

underneath this big table you get to the

end to strods chair where you can see

the sword laid across the arms and you

pull it and down and nobody sees you yep

and then I guess just crawl back out

from where I came in and then wait by

the door

that's tricks left I'm just gonna be

staying there like sorkin behind my back

elegantly as we all would appreciate

this make another stealth check with

advantage to slip back out the way you

came including underneath the Duchess's

skirts with your big sword

you got the sword you slip back out you

pass right underneath the Duchess's

dress she doesn't even notice you might

just feel something but you know it

might just be the the music the vapors

davis and you you hide to one side of

the double doors just as they just as

Strix come seeping out to be underneath

them she is now back in the room oh but

all right Strix you can see paltin is no

longer playing

evylyn is no longer dancing and

everybody is looking at strawed who's

playing the pipe organ he's got his back

to the room is back to you you see no

sign of death

I'm not gonna do anything I'm just gonna

wait for this to play or wait for a wait

for I won't see you I I think DF is

probably doing something sneaky so I

don't want to do anything until I see

him and two things have changed since

you were here last is there's a big

tapestry hanging on one wall in the

portrait of arena is free standing up

against another wall the tapestries

there yes can I turn back solid behind

it yes a little bump okay I want to set

it on fire all right so Strix is gonna

go behind the tapestry and when she

appears just these little sort of black

feet stick out underneath the base of

the tapestry and this bulge where Strix

is whilst the music is playing and while

you watch the tapestry begins to smoke

and then a part of it just bursts into

flames creating this hole in the middle

that begins to sort of burn its way out

revealing Strix when they fire breaks

out everybody roll initiative Strad

stops playing Strix 17 death seven

evylyn 15 paltin six

Oh ru raha D nurse tricks I think she

she clouded back in two strikes to get

through the door yeah all right okay as

the tapestry goes up the first thing

that happens is the double doors to the

room open and raha Dean strides in with

sword in hand immediately looks about

the room sees use tricks and strides

over toward you sword raised cool

alright he moves with the grace you'd

expect of an elf I had but he used his

action to throw open the doors so when

he gets up to you he just stands in

front of you threatening to hack you

down and that's all that he can do on

his turn I'm pretty scared Strix

succeeded Strix you're next in the

initiative order alright I would like to

get on my broom and take off alright and

just go what okay also I would like to

yell at a at Sergei and Tatiana or at

least like oh man I need to tell them to

just to run to - yes fur don't know how

to do that hmm

I don't really want to alert everyone

else there so maybe I'll stay quiet for

a second okay but you don't up on your

broom yes and how are you going to oh

the ceiling

okay the feeling is quite high here so

yes you fly up to the ceiling just up Oh

question before I go again would minor

illusion be able to write something in

the air yeah okay cool and that's not oh

I could still do that I think if you

have it if you can do it as a bonus

action

because you've disengaged from raha

Dean's right that's me that was your

action yeah I don't think I can do it as

bonus action we're good to know

yep all right that's next up is straud

straud will a a turn to face raha Dean

and he says looking at the burnt

tapestry flames up the wall

yeah actually finding something far

worse to do

he tells raha Dean take the bride and

groom to safety and then he'll move over

to his chair and see that his sword is

gone then you hear a secret cthe um on

the chair and another sword comes up

through the armrest and he draws it

is that sword at least nowhere near as

nice looking as the one I stole no you

stole his nice sword is just a stock in

in hidden enthroned sword an ACME sword

yes so he draws the sword sees palton

and evylyn to his side and but he will

take it and he will level it across the

table at the Duchess yes yeah and he

says your treachery is revealed and she

just goes absolutely white great we did

it I mean and he says I didn't think you

had the guts like but as usual

you are an embarrassment yeah all right

and that is all he's going to do is

basically point his sword at the Duchess

which brings us to

evylyn i just take a defensive stance in

front of like not an obviously defensive

stance but I'm just kind of putting

myself in front of the couple okay well

you can choose one or the other because

they're on opposite sides of a table you

think the one probably most least likely

to be able to defend herself as Tatiana

okay so I'm just like c-3po over there

like nothing nothing control a lot okay

d/f you're next okay has Rolla Dean made

any kind of move to get Sarah Gadon and

uh no not yet okay but he came in

through like these large double doors

and the doors are thrown open yep great

and they lead out to the main foyer on

the ground floor of the castle all right

I'm gonna run out that way with Straub's

sword I'm like holding in such a way

where were I like when I turn to leave I

just like still use my body to hold to

hide the sword from from strawed or

whatever all right so you go out into

the hall alright and then you can see

that all is unlike you've seen

throughout the day strangely quiet right

now there are candle lights candelabras

flickering here and they are casting

shadows and pillars and the stairs

leading up stairs and things like that

and suits of armor and the alcoves but

nobody running around okay so so straw

sword is considered considered a

longsword basic yes okay man I'll have a

good way of getting rid of this right

now ones like

is a gimme hands now you there like for

instance there are alcoves with suits of

armor in it that are quite dark you

could probably watch the sword in the

back of one of those and unless

somebody's not looking there they

probably even like inside you could drop

it inside essentially pull back the head

and drop the sword inside clang clang

and then close it up again yeah I want

to do that okay

that's what you can put it inside one of

the random suits of armor so kinda like

goes down one of the legs got it alright

and then I'm going to run off to the

kitchen area or something similar or

just come back with like a bucket of

water to help the fire okay so you're

gonna go take off into the servants

areas where you believe they are okay so

DF disappears from view momentarily

next up Sergey reaches a handout to

Tatiana reaches both hands to China from

across the table and she takes him by

the hand he pulls her over the table to

him away from you evylyn and they make

their way toward the exit together yes

so bride and groom are bucking it

they're getting out of the room as fast

as possible can I continue to stay and

like defense like yeah yeah you're small

enough you can sort of move under the

table with Tatiana because that's all

you were doing on your turn and stay

stay with them yes yes and you you get

the impression that because they know

that you're on their side that you're

not the Duchess's assassins they're kind

of in on something that straud is not

yet aware of so they're trying to get

out of the scene as quickly as possible

did I have any insight from hearing what

Strad said as to like his relationship

to the Duchess's plans like from what he

said I I assume that he does or does not

have a make an insight check

sixteen you believe based on everything

that's are inspired and how straw has

behaved up to this point is that at some

point he was tipped off to the fact that

the Duchess was act that he spurned her

that she sort of invited herself to the

wedding she kind of landed on the

castles doorstep with her entourage with

a made up of excuse why she was here and

so by as a gracious host he felt

compelled to keep her let her hang out

and be present and as much as noan says

she is but he you figured that he knew

that something was up that she was

planning something all alone but didn't

necessarily know what and who the

players were but the whole you know

dumping the soup thing the sort of

botched the ham handed assassination

attempt on him followed by this you know

display has only cemented in his mind

that this is a desperate act on her part

like he didn't you don't think he

actually believed she would go through

with it like she didn't have the guts to

threaten him or his family in his house

and there's this mixture of anger and

delight that she has exposed herself so

ineptly

[Laughter]

but he already wished no none okay in

fact you don't think based on his

reaction so far there was even a glimmer

of that interesting okay thank you

you're welcome

so that's them which takes us to paltin

[Music]

so are you still crying things have

escalated

[Laughter]

nothing new so so what's so what's

everyone else doing right now

Sega bride and groom are fleeing the

room you don't know where deaaath is he

slipped out artfully and sorry evylyn is

following the bride and groom out Strix

is floating up near the ceiling of the

room on her broom after setting the

tapestry ablaze the tapestry of strods

father I might have it was the Duchess

and what's what's Simon up to right now

Simon is by your side he hasn't gone yet

but he will momentarily be like alright

alright son we have to go come with me

okay so you're just gonna hurry him out

of the room yeah down by the hand take

your man with another hair eyes yeah

alright you're this okay as you do Simon

is sort of pointing at the bride Simon

no no sort of look up at you while

you're running with him can I can i he's

suggestion and be like no okay cool now

he looks like spooky old Simon alright

he fails his wisdom save so what would

you like to suggest he do instead like

Simon it's not killing people and just

come with me okay he'll do is come with

you okay alright you're able since

you're only really since you moved in

cast the spell you're about ten feet

away from the double doors because you

were in the corner so you don't get all

the way to the doors but you're almost

right up to the bridon

and even so you're sort of all in the

clump

alright the Duchess as Simon goes past

sort of does a double take like she's

suddenly recognized that he is her gift

that her assassin is being led out of

the room

just don't look at her just just just

keep walking she puts her eyes back on

straw and throws herself down on the

floor at his actually she climbs up onto

the table this big woman and just lies

prostrate on the table and begs straw

forgiveness she says it was my tray to

her son he convinced me to betray you he

thinks you're a mad tyrant I disagreed

with him fought with him I argued with

him constantly he made me do it he made

me do it

her ass so hard and then we're back up

at the top with raha Dean he got orders

to protect the bride and groom so

despite Strix flying up there and

annoying him to no end he's going to yep

he is going to take with scimitar in

hand follow paltin and Simon and evylyn

and Tiana and Sergey and he's very very

he's faster than all of you on the

ground so he actually sweeps through you

all to the doorway make sure that the

entryway is safe for the bride and groom

and that's when I need des to make a

stealth check still 16 okay when he sees

you something about you here eh he knows

he knows that you are not part of the

castle staff he knows that you're with

the Duchess's group and immediately

suspect you of being an assassin

so he does not stop he comes over to you

and hacks at you with a scimitar are we

we're not close to each other right he

what he blew past you I mean me and yet

you're you can't cdf the the Dumbledore

you don't have entangled him right now

so when rotten springs upon you he

slashes you once but you get out of the

way he rolled a natural one yeah he just

hits the the the lid off the the helm

right off the suit of armor behind you

yeah his second swing is a sixteen you

have no armor on right it's out my armor

that will hit me alright

he deals you a biting wound that does 12

points of slashing damage points of

slashing damage and then he swings

around a third time oh crap there's a

paying fifteen on his attack roll

fifteen is just nothing okay and he does

ten points of slashing damage which you

can't touch all right party next up is

Strix Strix oh good everybody seems to

be leaving the room except you the

Dutchess and strawed it's East I look

like he believes her and she's like good

some I saw and blah blah blah make an

inside check oh I got a natural twenty

oh you don't think either of them

believe that's a b-tree great good

awesome okay I'm just gonna let that

play out are you gonna stay in the room

um no I'm gonna follow my party I wanted

to make sure that make sure that the

brining room get out safe all right

when you zoom down on your broom the

doors are tall enough that you can fly

over the heads of everybody right out

into the Great Hall where you see raha

Dean attacking DF oh good okay great so

I just

flew over yeah you just blew over

everybody's head great oh man I really I

want to save my really good stuff just

for later cuz I'm scared but I can

definitely do oh that's not gonna work

either oh man

there's so many things I could do mm-hmm

can I do actually I've never done this

one before but I wanted to do

careful spell count cold okay

selecting the regime okay make a

dexterity saving throw for him what you

saved you see again it's 16 okay here

old abysmally he takes the full Bravo oh

oh man and I haven't used this one yet

so it's my fancy spell so I need to find

my dice for it you're blasting baddies

yeah oh all right Koen of cold blasts

him from above okay and I'd like to make

the ground I see too if that works well

just the Colonel Cole just does cold

damage no just wind yeah ice and wind it

doesn't really create a slick for that

you need sleet storm oh that's a

different one okay yeah all right you're

casting it as a favour level spell yes

it's eight d eight oh Jesus all right

Wow

well Strix is taking care of that

business there's nobody in the room left

among you with straud oh that's not true

evylyn and paltin are still technically

in the room straud will move to the end

of the table and just pull the Duchess

off onto their floor onto the floor and

throw him at his feet nice

and then he says you will live long

enough to see your son once more I was

45 points of damage

holy smokes oh all right

raha Dena's engulfed with cold and after

getting just blasted from the back you

can see him tense up and he's got ice on

his head and shoulders and on his

scimitar and then he just goes and the

ice breaks off and he shakes it off

horribly horribly sort of blistered and

frostbitten by this cold it's still

alive I was hoping he was gonna shatter

I'm about one of those and he just looks

up over his shoulder and bares his teeth

at you strikes so Strada is done just

waiting evylyn you and the bride and

groom are sort of moving as a mob now

all time I mean Simon there near you and

you are yeah

raha Dean's out in the hall and strods

behind you now you're still in the room

you're still in the room ten feet from

the door it's super boring but I'm just

gonna keep guarding that's what Yana

alright great and if something comes in

their way I'll let you know and you can

you can act accordingly then next up is

DF okay you can hear a mob coming out of

the room now people are exiting they

haven't quite emerged yet though alright

well I've also got raha Dean yes stay on

her down I mean he's got blasted by cold

yes I don't know how well this is going

to work so I'm just going to get his

attention

and just explain to him or just like

almost kind of command on really just we

are not your targets keep them away from

the Duchess's I'm Leo one of the

guardsmen it conspire to take them out

do not return to their quarters you must

trust us on this okay make a persuasion

check

against his insight 18 okay he you can

tell right off the bat he kind of gives

a strange look like that's doesn't sound

right but he he does seem to hold back

in an instant

okay but it looks like just based on his

countenance he's waiting for some kind

of confirmation from somebody he's not

just gonna take you at your word yeah

so to prove like further prove that I am

NOT trying to like fight him I'm going

to disengage okay and then make my way

back towards the doors or the group okay

yeah when you get over to the doors you

can see they're all sort of coming to

you yes yeah I don't attack him at all

just try to explain things is it your

goal to just kind of move with them as

they come out yeah rather than just let

them blow past you okay right great

pretty much since you're acting on the

same turn as Sergei and same initiative

Candice Sergei and Tatiana I'm going to

say you can just sort of join them and

evylyn as well and when Sergei comes out

into the hall he could hear you plain as

day he says it's true they don't know

our enemies yeah look at this change in

history sorry all right

and then he only neck done instinct I

understand us raha Dean will allow them

and you and evylyn if she wants to pass

he'll get out of your way I turned to

death and I'm like I don't think Strad

is evil I think he's beautiful knee

wrote a beautiful song and maybe if we

show him the top you know then maybe he

won't be bad

until this is sorted we can't trust any

of them okay but maybe later we could

try to save stroud soul maybe sure maybe

okay we'll do it later

all right thanks coming down attic I

dramatically remove my servant robes in

a single arm

yes all right

naked underneath camera is low to the

ground looking upside look quite absurd

guards burst through into the entry hall

all dressed in the livery of castle and

borough via and immediately come on

raha dee in the Chamberlain points

toward the dining hall and says arrest

the Duchess and they will head off in

that direction and he says arrest all

right yeah you guys are actually doing

it

alright hold on we got 40 minutes Trix

are you done are you done blasting raha

Dean well the scalp will give you one

more glare and prestidigitation the like

dirt on the ice often you sweep the ice

off his shoulders and from his hair and

but that doesn't seem to change his

countenance his evil evil village

staring up at you all to stay up here

then yeah he kind of looks at you know

you brush the snow off of him bet with

your spell but oh yeah

he's not gonna forgive you for the 45

points of damage no sir

alright I'm gonna assume you guys are

kind of acting as a kind of mob now

since you're all together what would you

like to do as a group you see Sergei and

Tatiana are angling to go deeper into

the foyer away from the banquet hall Oh

Strix can now communicate yes

tell her friends that there's a that

there's a carriage waiting with yes fur

yeah and guards are blowing past you but

they're not listening to you or anything

they're following orders

all right do we know where the where the

carriage is positioned Tatiana says she

knows okay

well then yeah let's just let's move as

a group that way okay staying closer

together to protect her until they get

them into this care as you can get them

the F out of here where they can go

elope all right when make perception

checks everybody good after the after

the content of guards has barreled

through on their way completely change

people's ability to understand what's

going on it's good I got 14 okay 19 okay

I got a six mirin is set makeup yeah

pulling and pulling his wig off all

right this week are Strix and evylyn you

notice as you make your way from the

grand foyer out toward the front

entrance of the castle you have to leave

the castle in fact to go outside in the

courtyard around the castle to get to

the gate to the epic coach-house at

least that's what Tatiana says that's

when raha Dean who you've left back

deeper in the hall and he's gesturing to

the guards he takes a sudden active

interest in you again when he sees that

you're actually leaving the castle and

as the guards blow past him toward his

master he still with sword in hand

leaves them to their task and follows

you

[Laughter]

you talk to him once go talk to him

again I could go on but yeah Sergei and

Tatiana at this point are making haste

to get to the coast boopie for me

oh and Anna yeah evylyn with your 20 you

notice something else what at the top

there's a wide set of stairs off the

grand entry then go up to strods throne

hall and other places upstairs there is

a figure at the top of the staircase

watching all of this transpire with your

perception check you recognize her as

the young vez tani woman the drawing the

cards woman who called herself Catarina

great she's at the top of the stairs

watching you leave the castle if you

want to come to we're leaving oh no she

knows everything she doesn't say

anything she's just this shadow at the

top of the stairs come on your friends

are your friends have already run out

even you know it's the last one now

trying to she's not coming okay all

right but you follow your friends out

then yes okay you guys are all outside

now you can hear there's a wind blowing

night has fallen and the wind sort of

howls through the courtyard tearing at

your cloaks and coats and robes and

whatnot and the young couple make their

way to the coach out front of the coach

carriage house you can see a big black

carriage pulled by two big black horses

and there is a coachman at the reins

ready to go he's got a hood on so you

can't really see his features terribly

much but there's a little bit of blond

hair kind of poking through he's got his

cowl up pretty high his collar

and he leaps down opens the door for the

bride and allows the bride and groom to

enter I look that's your great-great

great-great-great-great- something

granddad isn't he nice then he takes

another swig of the wine flask and looks

at the rest of you and through his

collar and hood you can hear him say I

will take them as far away from the

castle as I can

I may need a distraction oh we can do

that we can be very distracting when you

pull himself back up onto the carriage

and you says do any of you wish to join

you may not escape alive I hope you

understand the sacrifice you've made

yeah that didn't dawn on me until we

actually left we didn't have an escape

plan how do we get she says this on her

flying broom also his waffles there as

well now dude I'm gonna say that that's

a very good question I'm gonna say she

was we didn't actually mention waffles

it's funny that she just came right now

I assume she's part of your retinue like

right she she was at the you know at the

foot of Paul tunes he was performing and

it's also dancing I'm stomping out of a

bush somewhere do that I personally

think it's very important for us to go

back and talk to non-evil Strada and try

to save his immortal soul that's

probably the best way to escape from

this place anyway in the light of

Lysander with his holy will he knows

with all wisdom it's also while you say

that the carriage leaves and Tatiana

it's just sort of waves at you through

window

please Alton the driver will throw you a

wineskin I forget who's in there already

[Laughter]

raha raha Dean comes into view he's

followed you out to the coach-house the

it looks like yes / does not attempt to

even go around him he tries to run Raja

Wow alright my comforting calls and I'm

like I'm sorry we interrupted your song

raha Dean rolled a 1 on his dexterity

saving throw strides horses and carriage

just completely run him over he is he

just is absolutely flattened into the

cobbles and after he just gets after his

dust elf gets completely run over by the

carriages up over top of him and

continues its way out toward a gatehouse

and disappears from view

you see rahat in just lying his corpse

or just lying still on me Alden finest

hilarious and then he gets up Oh sort of

staggers to his feet but you can see he

can barely walk

like he looks like he's kind of broken

in a couple places it just kind of snaps

himself together and he's bleeding like

half his face is torn off and you just

see it's completely red and bleeding

down the front of him a big part of his

scalp has been ripped out by the horse's

hooves

he picked no he

alive he's a living soldier God and he

looks down and he picks up his sword and

it's bent like how and he just throws it

down onto the ground and disgust do we

get a sense of this being some sort of

supernatural clicking things no you just

think he's a total badass just

took another fifty five points of damage

and if he's still not alive hundred

points yeah he's taken a total of 93

sorry a 98 points of damage at that

point weaponless he no longer advances

toward you instead he goes limping after

the coach he has no job actually

catching up yeah need medical attention

I'm just like throwing rocks at him you

felt him like the rocks yeah well his

Simon can't really throw a while so he

just sort of like Chuck's it like that

and it goes like ten feet tell Simon to

shoot him with the dart so he can go

peacefully

oh is that what we're doing he's gonna

keep chasing the carriage wait he's

crazy

real quickly like

jogging backwards like he's coming this

way and I'm kind of like just like

saying hi you know I'm like hey I don't

think you're gonna catch the couch but

if you want to hear about your future

and how you can be good instead of evil

I'd love to share the mighty light of

love and early pushes you down you see

you see as he rounded the corner of the

castle he has no intention of chasing

after the coach but he is going back

toward the entrance of the castle

probably to report distraught Jon's back

up to the party it's like come on time

to talk to Straub let's go saving

immortal soul you were that's this isn't

gonna work it will work levander has

blessed us and has sent us here for a

reason

you do it yourself let the other is the

light in all of us my my hands still

make sure yep let's say hinder let that

hand exist I don't think so of course

it's a helping hand

it's a helping hand all right what are

you guys doing now I can't I I'm scared

I don't know okay you're gonna you're

gonna lead the way there you go and

they're gonna stay with your friends I

am leaving the way but like come on

she's doing off so when you re-enter the

castle I'm not entering without them I'm

like but you're at the you at the

entrance though right waiting for your

friends I make a perception check Oh

five all right uh you see there rah rah

ha Dina's gone back in the castle blood

dripping on the floor as he goes inside

no no he's with you but he's not

stopping for your friends he's not

waiting for your friends to catch up I

thought he was lower than me I thought I

was just leaving him behind

oh I see what you're saying okay yeah

yes all right well he has definitely

headed your way then okay and whilst you

are waiting for him

you're five doesn't reveal much other

than estrade is in the foyer now looking

back in your direction they're safe you

see that woman who is at the top of the

stairs before Katarina has descended and

is approaching him what she's saying is

something she's saying something to him

but you can't hear what it is because

you're only world of five catches up to

you evil and death what had chased after

evil and she's probably up when you do

something stupid all right Circle fly-in

you're all at the entrance then raha

Dean is there with you by virtue of the

fact is moving quite slowly and Simon is

with palton and the hand is with palton

and waffles is galloping behind you all

the one thing we are so honored to have

been of help

strawed comes toward you Lord oh you

still you see he still got that sword

that he got out of his throne and broom

just like floats up as he gets cold yeah

he walks out toward you raha Dean tells

him that Tatiana and Sergei have fled

and you can actually see the coach

rolling across the through the gatehouse

across the great drawbridge into the

mountains

estrade barely even listens to raha Dean

just moves right past him and moves

right through you all or tries do you

give him license to pass

yes but I follow do it go night not

trying to okay straw blows through all

of you as he stands outside he lets out

a loud whistle and you hear galloping

hooves approaching no you see coming

around the other corner of the castle a

great black stallion are you interested

he goes he goes out to confront it now

he's going to just grab it as it rushes

past now is a quick thing is my is my

mandolin attuned to me yes

can I use levitate on the horse levitate

is only on you I think you can you can

make it levitate but I think it has to

be one creature object of your choice

that you can see rises vertically yes

you can an unwilling creature gets a

constitution saving through maybe don't

make it fly this only helps the timeline

so what's your what's your save DC there

palton that's a great question 15 all

right no whole persons tricks horse just

what a 14 on the die but I don't know

what its bonus is she's after them can

one of us try to talk to him while he's

doing this I'm trying to tell him about

the levander getting on the horse yes

you begin to play and cast a spell and

the horse is not affected by that spell

cool stretch stands in front of them

again Prentiss Tron yes he'll stab you

[Applause]

wait she's in my oral protection yes

so disadvantage course stabbed some

 all right so with disadvantage

he rolled an 18 dead

yes of course he hits me okay

better than the 25 can I freaking can I

tell Simon asleep duck the horse I'm

sure it'll make its attacker momentarily

all right

so Strix you feel the bite of the sword

through your body which does eight

points of damage but then but then you

feel something else

coursing through the blade some

something dreadful and unnatural and you

take another 24 points of necrotic

damage on the chair sort can this is not

the sword remember I hid the good sword

yeah yeah it was a good sort it would be

even more dangerous maybe death yes and

you sense that this this extra damage

you took it did not come from the sword

at all oh it came from him and at that

point Simon will step up sort of get up

in front of the horse open his mouth and

fire a dart hitting the horse all right

the horse roll 76 for me

Nathan oh did you you didn't specify

what kind of Dart did you you just said

shoot the horse he said sleep

I said you sleep okay in that case never

mind I'll just make a saving throw for

the horse all right

the horse is hit by the dart it lets out

a cry of pain but does not fall asleep

so I realize we're in a sort of

initiative order yes we should rubbish

it oh man can you can DF Act or yeah you

can all take your a cue so Strix acted

and Pelton acted what would you like to

do after I mean here's another way to

stop him but I'm stabbed almost with

like begrudgingly no was with like great

pain to himself

dear unchi

the gutter and goes up behind straud and

sneak attacks them all right yes I just

wanted to save this so save me I'm sad

she is dead

21 all right

you hit roll your damage and remember

gutter gives you an extra 2d6 on top of

your other decent sissies yep how many

is that that's a total of well seven

from sneak attack and one for the

short-sword look raha Dean just got run

over by a carriage and he's fine so I

think there's only two ones so it's not

too bad

[Music]

9:34 all right you stabbed Stroud right

between his shoulders in the back

spilling royal blood upon the

cobblestones before Castle Ravenloft yes

that causes straw to rear up a bit in

pain but it's not the first time he's

felt such a grievous wound in his many

years on the battlefield you actually

feel the blade bite into scar tissue

hardened wounds and he will turn his

gaze upon you and there is a glare in

his eyes you have never seen in a man or

monster before and that's where we'll

stop for tonight yes so before we part

this is terrible what is that what is

that horse this is the horse's bow

cephalus strods prized steed he is he is

something to be reckoned with I have

learned as we will find out next week

this is no mere mortal horse and he is a

horse of many many battles but before we

take our leave just I wanted to share

with you the final exchange in this

timeline between Katarina

and strawed oh yeah the words you did

not hear but I want the audience to hear

oh he said to him the gods have taken

her from you they mock you to which he

replied what do these powers you speak

of offer me and she said they can defeat

time they can make you immortal in ways

that wars cannot they exist only to

serve you my master tempter marionette

executioner next week's episode of

Daisuke alright any any announcements

you guys want to make before we have the

showdown with straud terrible no I just

want to go hide forever

it was terrible left and I'm stabbed

welcome to rip our feed and put your own

commentary over the top of it whatever

insight about being a host and also

learning from tons of cool people who

will be doing the same thing that is a

hard-ass skill let me tell you having

watching you do it you make it look so

easy but it's not

it's one it's like our first attempt at

ever doing something like this so it's

definitely a pilot and we're definitely

looking for lots of feedback and leeway

of judgment so so yeah oh and on

high schoolers who build robots in
