welcome to dice camera action and a D&D

show and this is our 100 and first

episode or first yes we got through 100

episodes last weekend when the waffle

crew and the C team joined forces to

save the multiverse it's all downhill

from here folks

no it's been saved it's fine yeah it's

all good

it was so it was so magical it was a

magical experience and thank you

everybody who was able to watch it and

we had a lot of fun

certainly so we are or down one Jared

and 1df today Jared is traveling so but

but the adventure continues now a

question for you guys no I don't want to

die

no girl good good second question for

you guys is you're gonna leave Knights

stone and make your way make the journey

northward back to Waterdeep and you'll

pass many sites and small little

villages on the way you'll even go

you'll even pass dagger furred at one

point and then cross a bridge over a

river to make your way to the grand city

of Waterdeep that journey happens along

well patrolled Road and there's really

no danger to it but I did want to ask

you if there's any business or things

that you want to do on the trip back to

Waterdeep and one of the other questions

I have for you is are you allowing van

Rycke Dhin to tag along

right right before right before we leave

so we get like a minute lead I just like

I just want to try to banish him okay

it's more than god yeah in a in a blast

of oily smoke

van Rycke tonicity r--'s banished to

some nether realm that paltin has

sent him to allowing me effect plenty of

time to get out of sight and on your way

before he returns a banished word or

anything like what does he what does he

do when he banishes somebody he just

like holds out a hand it's just like

[Laughter]

cool I would like to have a heartfelt

goodbye with Rosie be stinger and thank

her for her kind acceptance into her

family before I leave and then um

also are there just like okay like how

much of this was an illusion and how

much of this was like actually real like

oh they're demon guts all over the

ground so the demon guts sort of turned

into a bouldering stinky mass puddle of

occur over time so none of the actual

entrails are preserved what's left is

just little puddles of a stinky goo was

there anything off of that pit fiend

that like we could take it does have

this immensely heavy case of Ivan I was

five hundred calendar days that had left

behind that's that was still smoldering

and evylyn doesn't like the cast of it

it's just it it is offensive

well that's party night stone now

bye-bye

but you leave nice stone behind the

people of night stone will let you take

a cart and a mule that you can basically

ride your way back to town with a mule

mule yes what is its name they tell you

that its name is Henrik but you can name

it anything you want because it doesn't

seem to respond to Henrik I cast speak

with animals and ask it what its name is

all right let me why is important what

are the important questions yeah it is

important I'm going to roll this

randomly Holly I didn't know he didn't

know he was presenting us with a new

pathway with

when you get on a flight do you not ask

for like all of the attendant

it's names yeah I was the pilot you're

just like I just want to know well yeah

if they're gonna serve you you should

know them on a first name basis at least

the Mules name is Lance Lance Lance as

in Lance Bass of NSYNC then Lance a long

weapon that you poke people with yes

okay as soon as you cast speak with

animals and straights just looks that

even less like why did you never do that

for waffles or stork or juniper why are

you doing it on this mule because

waffles it's not an animal and I can't

do it and I tried the forestry and

juniper doesn't ever talk cuz all she

does is eat and sleep and we have a very

good understanding of each other I guess

some waffles is an animal I guess I

forgot about that technically true and I

two waffles at that point I'm like and I

don't need to have a special language to

speak do you do a baby that's right I

like go to the back of the wagon okay I

tell Lance that you said hello nice to

me

so Lance trucks on and you're riding in

the cart and the carts not comfortable

but you pack some hay in there to kind

of soften the ride waffles were just

sort of gamble behind you

cheerily Simon will probably be riding

shotgun with whoever is controlling

Lance it's usually Strix so that's even

makes less sense well yeah even when I

talk to Lance

Bryan all right uh yeah just for just

for flavor like we're riding bones just

like man I'm hungry I haven't eaten in a

bit and he he like kind of looks around

and I'd like to imagine this scene

there's like there's a widescreen bars

of top and bottom and he just kind of

reaches over one and I'm just like pull

something out of the audience know just

like pulls up a D&D mug nice tricks this

late that's what's that prestidigitation

I'm just gonna assume that it was yeah

sure never sign that mugged

or or that strange symbol or icon on it

it's not cool though very draconic nice

branding I'd be careful it looks like it

could hold poison no it is so far yeah

it is it is springtime so the weather is

actually quite pleasant on the wind

coming off the coast you enjoy the good

weather all the way back to the city

when you get to the city gate of

Waterdeep you can see that there's a bit

of a line to get in and I'm gonna say

just randomly that it is a round mid

afternoon the Sun is sort of passing in

and out of thick clouds coming in over

the ocean and when the clouds shine upon

you you're warm and when they don't

you're kind of cold

except for Simon who doesn't care about

such things and you're waiting in line

you finally get up to the guards and you

can see that there are some guards that

just sort of stand off to the side and

they sort of look through sheets of

paper and casts glances up at you almost

like they're looking for specific people

who might be trying to slip into the

city while others are kind of using

poles and swords and things just to poke

through the straw in your cart to make

sure that you're not hiding any

contraband and you clearly aren't so

strikes like hides a couple of mushrooms

showing a hole in the road like in her

robes like she fully expects them to ask

you know what that contraband have you

gathered in the roadside and are you

carrying illicit mushrooms into the city

and they don't okay and when they

realize carrying anything that really

that they can tax you because you are in

a wagon they do charge you a copper

piece dude are you sure well actually

the glowing radiance of evylyn and the

the symbol of Lysander prominently

displayed on most of her gear allows

them to forgo any such payment they're

just delighted that you've returned to

their City and days of your sunshine

warm their hearts evermore

bless your hearts may the morning Lord

shine upon what is Diaz doing this whole

time is he just like brooding and I I

assume he's kind of brooding he's

probably still wrangling with this idea

that you are now part of the Beast

singer clan and what that means and

isn't acting happy she's like it's all

happy you're happy and is it all really

over like he's wrestling with many many

issues occasionally he politely chimes

up in like to engage in conversations so

he doesn't come across as a complete

douche or anything but no I mad indeed

so like deep and broody thoughts Paul's

just look at him is just like eating a

corn take lunch like throwing at him

every time it does tricks picks it off

of the floor and eats it yep and it's

been a multi day journey so periodically

you did stop for the night and palton

put up the waffle hut and you kind of

camped out in there and and didn't

experience any trials or tribulations so

it has been several days of paltin just

kind of tossing little corn fences at ya

so by the time you guys trundle into the

city make your way through the trades

Ward up into the North Ward DF is very

very happy to hurry upstairs unpack his

things grab a backpack and then kind of

leave on errands he tells you where he's

going he says he's going to probably go

spend some alone time fish which he

hasn't done in a long long time and then

he's gonna maybe catch up with the city

watch about what happened in the matter

dealing with the garbage monsters just

to see if he can get some closure for

you on that regard and you don't want

any company just being all along sorta

he politely says he'd prefer he's got

some things he needs to think about and

he'd prefer to do it alone yeah as he

leaves it's just like Oh have fun make

sure not to mate that's it right in any

danger and if you do just you know

scream or something but like she's so

nonchalant about him leaving and it's

like right I'm it's weird it's alarming

of the way in a way it's it's alarming

in itself and she just like goes back

upstairs and I just imagine just

standing there like just staring at her

back

just going back meanwhile evylyn and

Talton have walked into the tap room and

are looking around at me alright charred

walls yeah the other thing you notice is

that there was a slip

somebody slid a piece of paper under the

front door and it kind of got maybe

blown into a corner somewhere but you'd

you do find it and it's a notice from

the city watch asking the owners of this

establishment to report to a watch post

for deposition yeah deposition yeah

obviously expressing it the note

suggests although it doesn't say so

implicitly that the city watch is

obviously aware of something bad that

happened and they want you to report on

it

oh well I love giving depositions but I

can't because I wasn't here fair enough

and as you look around yes you see that

the the tap room is sort of a blasted

blackened ruin the bar is badly damaged

there's a hole in the ceiling above

through which you can see what used to

be the common room and the windows have

cracks and holes in them where the glass

got blown out so neither of you were

here and this is your first time seeing

it and strix is like yes like even

looking around like my Instagram paltin

you can see that the the arms on your

straw chair are singed black oh now is

it like tasteful it looks like it's been

kind of antique so Paul Mike walks in he

sees like the blown out ceiling and like

the the chariot and he's like strix

there's also like a metal a thin spindly

metal leg or like ankle with a foot on

the seat of the chair just lying there

clearly a piece of some creature that

got blown to bits

yeah long story short it was the mercy

killers before you know he solved that

problem right and they brought some mod

roms who explode am i sorry mana drowns

like he cuts her off yeah and just like

you don't have to lie to me I just want

to say I see what you were going for and

I think we're going in a good direction

I like the high ceilings that's a that's

a good move it probably could have been

a cleaner maybe less you know fire use

there's like tools yeah you know you

could have done that but I I think I

think we can I think we can work with

this yeah you're pretty sure to that it

probably easier to replace the windows

then clean the ones you had so

yeah like Chris said it's yeah so yeah

this I think this I think this can work

I'm seeing it in my head yeah it's like

hearing this and kind of like trying to

see what he's saying about this being a

good direction and like it's like yeah

we got we have the high ceilings now we

can put a couple like you know just a

couple of support beams cuz you know

it's very not safe but it's time it

looks like you could also put in an

internal staircase cuz currently I have

to kind of walk around the back of the

house to get upstairs Wow like thinking

I'm thinking spiral stairs ah even here

spiral staircase and she's like oh yes

right now when this is all happening

like strictly okay and just like leaves

and palton and evil one can talk about

decorating and so she just goes back up

to person and Diaz the room yeah and

when she does that she uh she sees like

her stuff on the floor like just in the

corner and just like where she sleeps

it's just like a floor sleep and she

kind of like looks at it and like looks

at the room and the bed and I'm sure

there's nothing in here that DF is put

in here I'm sure it's just like totally

empty other than like I don't know like

a a like lockpick and yeah she just kind

of looks and she's like I don't know why

I sleep on the floor why do I sleep on

the floor and so she'll just go and

gather up her stuff and she's gonna try

and find her own room okay you can take

you can take the empty room on the same

level that waffles done yeah so she just

goes up to the dead and finds her own

room and I'm sure there's a bed in there

too yep and she just kind of like sets

her stuff up she actually takes a couple

of things off her robes and sets them

like on the windowsill and like there's

actually a really nice slender wardrobe

in this room too that you didn't notice

cuz when you open the just to look in

the door kind of blocked the view of it

as you sort of look around the room you

see it's standing by the door it's this

tall thin a beautifully carved wooden

thing with these sort of silts and other

kind of elemental creatures worked into

the design Oh neat can I

open it is there anything in it some

hangers and and there's a sort of a

standing back mirror they're kind of

resting at the back of the Wardrobe

which come here which can actually be

pulled out yeah oh I'll pull it out yeah

okay

and I'll just put it somewhere in the

room and also I don't know if Preston

ization or works this way but I want to

like make the walls in the room like

black or dark green or something

okay there is sort of pili old wallpaper

here that probably should be stripped

off and then replaced with something

before you start to color everything

okay well I think about that later and

I'm like and then uh she'll also go down

to the library and if there's any like

weird occult look she'll bring him up to

a room and just set him up no books per

se just empty shelves and bookends and

other but ya know disappointing but note

notes to herself to get books yep

but yeah she just kind of makes it her

own space with whatever she has like

just and she's just kind of sits there

like and looks at it and then just goes

back downstairs okay I think when you

come back downstairs

evylyn has like a full drafting paper

out and she's like drawing exactly

Politan is like pointing to things and

like telling her what what they should

build we both have hard hats and I

imagine paulten houses which stream up

and he's like streaming the

home-improvement like we're now an HDTV

stream kinda I don't know but so evylyn

is taking all these notes and she has

like a pile of notes and she's like I

have to go get stuff for this right now

okay you do that okay stay yeah that's a

good idea see have any more inspiration

hits you just jump around Oh what are we

doing theme-wise are we doing a theme oh

love themes what kind of theme I don't

know let's see there's tap room down

here common room up there it's like

maybe a sentence C maybe you know

Lysander I am away now he is like wait I

I think I think I have an idea

hold that thought I'm very happy on your

way I'm getting inspiration okay I think

I have something

uh-huh it's a surprise can't rush it

yeah you like your like heat glances

over at the straw chair he's just like

yeah I think I have an idea

do I need to pick anything else up I

mean I'm gonna get the timber and the

nails and all the stuff anything

anything in red oh yeah whatever you say

okay cool so evil and evil and bustles

out the door to go get supplies cuz

she's gonna look build a spiral

staircase by herself right now okay the

moment districts grabs that modren arm

and shuffles that quickly back up to a

room in the back down okay she takes a

bunch of those and she brings it back up

to room it's a project for later evylyn

make a wisdom check my pleasure Chris

Parkinson that is sixteen okay um as you

head off our flutter flutter flutter

flutter flutter you you notice that uh

well just to get this out of the way

Lance the mule and the wagon are still

kind of just parked out in front of the

place I take Lance with me okay so you

you steer Lance around you're at the

reins Lance is very good to you he just

sort of leads you wherever you want to

go and then it occurs to you as you exit

Trull skull alley on to del zoom street

that you know who's really good at

building things

Magnus Burnside so at some point you may

before you proceed down this path too

far and build a spiral staircase you may

want to find him consult with him about

how to do that and perhaps solicit his

help in this regard if he in Waterdeep

he said that he was hanging around he

had some other stuff to attend to but he

is not is easily within the realm of

contact if you like to use a sending

spell or you can send a missive off to

the plinth and it will be delivered to

him the plinth is like this central

location where mail can be sent and then

disseminated yes that's what she'll do

she'll go send him a message

alright we're gonna send we're gonna

send the landlord's our

our renovation it also cursed you that

Magnus you might have to talk him

through the whole blowing up the taproom

thing she she was like super happy like

dude - I'm gonna go fix the house and

then it occurred to her that this wasn't

actually her house and then this

actually was a major innovation so she

makes a copy of the blueprints and stuff

holds it all up nice put some little

kiss marks on it a little message to

Magnus and it's it's like half just like

niceties like oh yeah we miss you here's

what's been going on everyone's good DF

misses you both and then like also we're

thinking about a spiral carrot staircase

from the top room to the common room

what do you think here's my blueprint

yes you think that confronted with the

logic of having an internal staircase

off the taproom it you you can't imagine

him saying no I invite him to come help

with the Renault in a special guest

episode they'll be like why didn't it

have this all the time I mean anyway

you're you're fairly confident that

you've made a strong case and the kiss

marks you think we'll put it over the

top snow so I sign it your battle buddy

evylyn right palton what are you doing

after Evelyn's shuttled off with Lance

and Strix has told you about her room um

so he's just he's still like playing

stuff he's like okay yeah so we clean

out that hole and it'll be a good we can

do that we can have like lots of red

curtains okay he's like red and and say

wait right hold on hold on it's like

it's like okay I was like I was really

trying to figure out how to connect this

to Simon I just remembered Simon so I

mad where's Simon

he's wandered off somewhere drinks is at

the bar luckily he Lincoln is about to

go look for Simon and then he just sees

strict sitting at the bar he's like and

the bars in bad shape just one of the

legs of the chair she's sitting on just

like what direction should the plot go

right now

Barr's closer to the bar you both notice

for the first time tucked behind the

splintered wreckage of the bar are for

presence wasn't presence yes i left in

their presence you can see that there is

a tall kind of wreck flat rectangle

present and you can see that it's got

gold and white and pink wrapping paper

with a bow and it's addressed to evylyn

I don't like this you can see that there

is a sort of resting on a shelf next to

that is a small little square box

dressed or sort of in smoky grey

newspaper wrapped up with a tag with

Stricker's name on it then next to that

is a purple and red beautifully kind of

varnished old wooden box with a bow kind

of wrapped around it and that you can

see carved into the box our little sort

of musical notes and this one's

addressed to palton huh and then the

last one you can see is sort of a long

slightly bigger than a shoebox box that

is kind of wrapped up in purple and

green paper with a kind of a rope with a

sort of a complex knot on top and

there's a little card tucked under it

that says di o are we getting post

episode 100 DM presents mm-hmm yep Strix

did you let someone in and three oh good

I'm very concerned

and bombs or poison or anything because

we don't get presents

halten we don't get presents actually

Strix you're not as concerned as you

think you are you you you sense that

these are not malevolent okay that's why

weirds me out a little bit but as I feel

the wave of calm washed over me

palms already opening here it's just

like yeah all right you pop yours open

paltin you can see that within this

carved wooden box is a beautiful folded

cloak garment go on and Strix your eye

open mine I open mine now that I feel

better and suddenly my anxiety has

washed away by my newfound composure and

I I undo it

okay when you see your item and Paul

toons item you're pretty sure they're

both magical and yours Strix appears to

be this beautiful little spice pouch oh

so that's fun a beautiful cloak and a

beautiful spice pouch what colors they

look like I'll leave the details up to

you guys what's what's the spice pouch I

immediately open it and like stick my

hand in it it appears to be empty as you

stick your hand in it but you sense that

there's more to this spice pouch than

meets the eye and perhaps if you were to

cast like an identify spell or something

on it you'd be able to ascertain what it

does can i Arcana check it I'll let you

do that alright go ahead

o-22 given enough time you kind of check

this thing out you know for 10-15

minutes and then you realize that it is

a huge handy spice pouch common wondrous

item that appears that appears empty but

has ten charges while holding the pouch

you can use an action to expend one of

its charges speak the name of any non

magical food seasoning such as salt

pepper

Safran cilantro whatever and remove a

pinch of the desired seasoning from the

pouch and the pinch is enough to season

a single meal the pouch will regain one

be six plus four of its expended charges

each day at dawn oh so I can just make

everything taste good that's right no I

love it I just like I do it like a

couple times and I'm just like I just

like

pause and it comes back to cinnamon

[Laughter]

holding what's yours what's yours doing

a look at it I'm gonna look at it Jimmy

I got it can you look at it oh of course

that's 24 okay you believe his is a

common wondrous item called a cloak of

billowing while wearing this cloak you

can use a bonus action to make it billow

dramatically Chuck called that by the

way immediately do it do it do it do it

strings like jumping up and down do it

[Laughter]

[Applause]

Wow and he's like ah that's cool okay um

what else

oh he starts opening - you make a

dexterity check try to undo the knot

okay let's see here he's just like

struggling with it like this knot is

literally the most complicated rocket

science like it's just like I knew it

but knots impenetrable no one can undo

this knot it wasn't meant to be open he

just like throws the box

because it was an out one by the way

well no one's getting it anyway that

nots like magic or something are you

gonna open it evil ends we just gonna

let her open it now she'll be back soon

[Laughter]

well strikes is gonna take the present

and just like shuffle it up Cydia saw

room and put it on his bed okay and then

come back and be like there it's not

yours there when you go upstairs paltin

the trapdoor leading down to the

basement opens and nasca the dwarf

climbs out coming up the stairs from the

cellar Alton looks at him just kind of

gives him like a high and he looks

around he says I didn't do it oppresses

oh he's looking at the devastation oh

that I was thinking more in the presents

oh no this is uh this is a renovation

where it's a work it's a work in

progress he looks around skeptically

yeah you see see this is why this is why

we're doing this cuz you see you see

what is but we see what could be he says

where is evylyn oh I missed you so much

yeah why are you live here please leave

see yeah that's that's a that's a really

good question better question what are

know about the zenith our guild and I

want to help you know protect you from

them because they're terrible how many

episodes have we been over that orc you

happen to evil in Psych

he's like I'm if I may I would like to

roll a little persuasion check ok yeah

ok before I actually say anything also

at this point Strix is going to be

drinking at the bar very

uncharacteristically apart ok just alone

at the bar drinking ass unseen services

bring her more wine and so all the wine

bottles got destroyed but there is some

there's like a half keg of ale

oh that's fine good whatever that was a

19 okay and what are you attempting to

[Music]

he turns to leave and makes his way to

the door gets halfway there and kind of

looks over his shoulder at Strix when

you don't say anything he keeps march

like at least like three giant like

tankards of ale in at this point and

she's looking around at the but chairs

and she's like puppet come here it's

funny come here hold on hold on

and like as he's leaving like bombs

about to close the door he's just like I

hope that wasn't important and just shot

he stands out on the stoop I'm not sure

what to do for like an hour I'm gonna

chorus tricks I'm like what and she she

animates one of the one of them it's

like broken chairs so it's just like a

like a walking like monster and she's

like the pauses you could do that too

you should do it we should make a fight

come on

trashed at this point she's like falling

off fight like her witch hands off like

her cloaca dog like her robes are just

like half off like just whatever stopped

on she's like just you've never seen her

getting drunk before like you've never

seen this happen she's a little tipsy

sure horrible like lists back and forth

Janet sir are you drunk right now I

don't know baby

what is that is that what this is just

like does it feel like everything's a

lot easier yeah and she just like makes

the chair run around Yap Alton she's

like she's like stage 3 drunk just like

new Strix is awesome let's go and he

like just chugs whatever is nearby he's

like all right

let's go and he animates his chair so he

drinks like two big gulps of spoiled

milk like immediately throws it up and I

would like to actually grab alcohol okay

I was like a little bit left in the

bottom of strict TSA's mugs so you just

sort of grab that ending gammon did you

say you animate your chair like the

straw chair mm-hmm oh you drinks tricks

and the districtís drinks like no that

there's more there's more right I don't

know so you've each animated a chair yup

yeah okay then what do you do we're

gonna make a fight chair fight cheer

fight okay Wow all right

so strix your chair it's a little bit

battered and blackened I'm gonna treat

it as a small object so it has 25 hit

points oh oh we're actually fighting the

chairs

well you said chair fighting right so

it's got 25 hit points in an armored

claw well you can just if you look at

the spell and I mean just look at your

stats for small okay all right paltin

your chair is a medium chair Oh No

so it's easier to hit but has more hit

points and it's not quite as accurate

but deals more damage so this is

actually gonna be an interesting we both

say chair fight and that we take stances

and their next all right so each of you

roll initiative for your chair dirts

tricks it's plus two on the rolling for

Colton that's plus one okay eighteen I

got a 13 okay Paul there goes first

so plow your plus five to hit with your

chair okay and you go you got to hit a

16 okay

uh well that was a 17 okay so you do now

you do 2d six plus one point six plus 1

okay so straw share punches black and

chair for 1000 part of the back flies

off your chair Strix but your chair

retaliates its +6 to hit oh man my

chairs so ready 13 I did it I rolled it

to its turn super anime pawns like it

appears your chair has not trained hard

at this point can even open the front

door in return so let's let's just break

off the chair combat for a second evylyn

as you make your way to delivering the

message you see Nazca stand or walking

walking down the steps away from the

house a little thundercloud of anger

over his head his shoulders

sagging his lip lower lip sticking out

far too far too low and he sees you and

looks up and and suddenly senses a turn

in turn in nos misfortune is imminent

and he stands there as you cart come by

with your cart and Lance Walton threw me

out out of wire and I was looking after

the place while you were gone you were

you were house-sitting more like under

house-sitting why because I was worried

somebody might you know vandalize him

and steal your things

oh that's so nice it's totally an

invasion of privacy but still nice

invasion of what privacy it's I don't

know a thing

but you see you doesn't even register

feet we certainly have enough room you

he he actually has some trouble timing

up because he got one hand and then a

crossbow hand so he like tries to pull

himself up on the cart how do you shower

and it shower he tries to pull himself

on the card I'll make an athletics check

for him after some struggle he does

succeed he finally gets up into the back

of the cart great so she continues home

okay and then you barge in the door with

nasca a few paces behind you and you see

chair fight so even sees this instantly

clean off of um nice and like they don't

have eyes but you can feel the eye

contact as it's going down yes chair

rectum has one last tremble before it is

completely splintered into irretrievable

pieces it was a valiant effort but you

have much more training to do because

there's only one champ and now we go to

the winner for our winners interview

strap on chair of it she positions it so

it looks like the chair but Politan is

right next to her on chair of it you

have emerged victorious in the most

important chair fight competition of the

entire year

- what do you attribute your success

often like well you know behind every

champ there's tricks from the ground is

the chair alright well so I give minds

like well behind every great fighter

there is always an even

coach and I couldn't have done it

without and then like I just like push

the chair out of the way it was me it

was me the whole time

Nazca is like looking through a broken

window and just shaking his head like he

doesn't understand what's going on

stretch points to the evil ed Wheaton

you got a present from a mysterious

stranger

he was like perfect she hands the which

stream officer yeah you see this big box

behind the bar sort of a slender it's

either you know a mirror a TV or

something in that shape but anyway

should I open it now it's beautifully

wrapped yeah do it thank our sponsors

and close down the stream please oh yo

yeah thank you so much you want to give

a shout out to uh - uh hold on I have

something I don't know some sums of wine

wineries thank you for yeah the stream

and oh yeah thank you for the bits we

appreciate it

it's like Oh omens here okay anyway yeah

thought approve turn off the stream I'm

gonna open my present I don't want them

to see what it is okay there's there's

gonna be spoilers so we got a cutter

here thanks for thanks for tuning in fam

y'all make sure dab on the haters and

you just closes it out all right all

right even opens her present and she

does it in that really annoying super

delicate way with someone where

someone's like trying to save all the

paper yeah okay yeah so 15 minutes later

she is sort of undone one end of it and

is now proceeding to get the whatever it

is without damaging the paper so she

need to sort of slide it off this

perfect little soft box of wrapped up

paper put it off to the side and now

she's just looking at a plain box really

that you can just actually it's more

it's like a little mini crate so that

you can crack

open and when you do you see that there

is a beautiful gold-plated shield inside

it a shield

indeed and the front of it is shaped in

the likeness of a face what kind of face

a human face it looks like great it

looks like your face

[Laughter]

they're like rays of light protruding

from the face strikes you bought me this

no I don't buy anyone anything I find it

on the ground you found this on the

ground no she's like on the ground at

this point man like I think I'm gonna

throw up

there's like boiled milk barf already

bye bye banging he was been skirting

around that which is like where did the

presents come from I don't know but I

think it's magic is that one magic do

you want me to look I don't really want

to look at yours actually you can figure

it out it's why why don't you want to

look at it it's got a face on it well it

looks like my face do you hate my face I

roll the one I don't know what it is I'm

sorry all right evylyn takes a look at

it okay in sight nope I you can't you

can't without any kind of magical spell

like a can I can i what it is can I like

Arkana check it even though I have no

proficiency or religion check it no fine

well cool I guess this gold shield was

my face on it is here now I can check it

again tomorrow when I must drunk okay

you guys don't have any idea where these

came from doesn't that bother you at all

came from the bar like the bark things

maybe it was the obscene service Oh

servants you shouldn't have I don't

think we're on good terms of thing

considering we blew up half the house

yeah you haven't seen any sign of the

unseen servants down here in the tap

room well yeah they're unseen right

they weren't pouring the drinks nope oh

oh I did serve myself I thought that was

weird

we should probably find out what's up

with that

Magnus might not like us blowing up the

unseen servants in this house Alden like

looks around it's like if you guys are

okay don't say it don't do anything see

they're fine I have a room now oh you do

I may have gave myself a room evil and I

it's not the floor oh that's so nice

did you put up stuff in it did you

decorate it I kind of right now there's

just pieces with dead madra do you want

help no are you sure I don't want no no

no are you sure no okay she looks at

Paulding she's like you already have too

much work with the taproom why would I

ever have to give you that much more

work evil oh oh the tap

oh she opens the door again to where she

left all the lumber and nos she's like

oh hey I'm Nazca he needs a place to

stay he said he wants to live in the

basement he brings the lumber in and

just sort of drops it on the floor and

he says he stands next to evil and and

just kind of what just kind of gives

this yellow toothy smile at paltin and

then Wendy villain looks his way he

turns serious again it Paulding look Sam

is just like he's like thinking he looks

it's like even you got the memo you got

my oh that's so good I'm I'm glad we

didn't even need to talk about yes

you're totally right he looks at Nazca

it's like that is correct we were

looking out to rent out our basement so

um the yeah exactly the rent is uh how

much was our rent on this place ten

golden one ten twenty gold a month uh

when you called 20 gold yes it's a very

look at this beautiful place also 400

you don't even do we are in serious

offense at that

it's like he said crapple they said damn

hole Dan Paul um I don't think it's a

hole or damn it isn't literally in a

hole I think we're doing I'm at warning

facial what a hole is I'll bet you do

now we're doing some renovations where

we're fixing this place up also they're

putting in so much stuff in the area

they're like making this like I want

like an arts district type thing you

know so like property that is gonna so

like if you don't get our rent now man

you might as well just like you know

move somewhere else cuz it's gonna be

it's gonna be cray all the all the hip

all my money is down in the zennith our

guild headquarters well it's like it

that works out perfectly because you

were just on your way there too so just

grab it while you're there I can't go

back there

no attitude you cannot so yeah they'll

kill me if I go there alone it's like

look I just used my once extreme

trademark phrase on you and if you put

that to wear something really upset I

don't think you realize how big of a

deal that is we're getting shirts made

maybe and you should probably get on

that buddy yeah look I don't really deal

with the money for us but I feel like if

Paulson suggested that it's probably

fair mm-hmm it's a really nice

neighborhood that's not fair at all 20

gold for a month I mean no 20 gold every

month I'm I will go and I will find a

place in the sewers to live until I get

the money to afford this place or

someplace nicer so and dude like even

the sewer rents gonna go up you don't

even know man this place is gonna be

bumpin got a hot tip got a friend in and

uh but you see a space that just settled

into a scowl at you palton just the side

this vengeful hateful stare okay that's

fantastic thank you sir anyway you have

a great day okay good luck with

everything and I'm gonna have to leave

now he can hang out no I don't wanna I

don't want to stay with him he doesn't

like me clearly and doesn't appreciate

all of the help that I've rendered

paltin

is it true when you say help define help

he says back at the place with all the

chairs when I could have killed you and

I didn't and I helped you I shot two

goblins who I didn't like anyway but

still they're dead

kudos me yeah do you know how to do um

construction yeah yeah and then he says

he's about to say you know I'm a dwarf

of course and then it kind of looks down

and his his no chopped off hand with the

crossbow mounted to it and he's like not

so much no ok there's a very very that

you know what I'm open to it we just

need to do a quick interview as a

potential tenant and we'll consider

dropping the rate there's just a quick

thing an interview yeah just super quick

it'll literally take five seconds we can

do it right here right now just to see

if you qualify stow it and he takes out

he just takes out a gold coin just holds

it up and goes take it oh you rolled a

natural 20 look that was rude but we

have a strict no shooting roommates

policy yeah your time to leave he shoots

you for 32 points of their okay even

gets real mad and as you buckle under

that the coin drops rolls over to his

boot and he picks it up oh I I I banish

him you're like gasping for air why and

she disappears okay you you sort of

you're like on three one

yeah okay heel oh yeah that's that's

good better it's really good okay nice

how much healing you giving all of it 32

all right

she's just like a little scar remains is

it cold does it look cool I'm unique let

me see with your shirt off it will

because like rate and reduce stomach so

Oh sick okay I guess it's like ah good

great cool so um I'm gonna suggest we

interview maybe a couple other potential

tenants i I just get a weird vibe from

that guy you know with him shooting me I

am I think he is a poor misguided soul

and he deserves our help and

understanding and compassion however I

do think that when behavior reaches a

certain threshold one has the right to

protect themselves so like shooting me

right so yes I agree maybe he's not the

best roommate he shot me I know I'm real

sorry I brought I wouldn't I I was

giving him a proper unbiased interview

and the man shot me I mean maybe you're

interviewing I mean like you see as you

guys are to see Strix on the floor and

she's holding your tail and like you've

never even seen her acknowledged that

she has a tail at all and she's holding

your town she's going to you guys know I

have a tail is it like the moving yeah

yeah what that was I thought that was

like an accessor I thought you got like

I thought you got that from chair con or

something no mine and she's like

Sistrunk holding your Cheerilee isn't

that fun oh by the way vivillon new

Strix gets drunk I like new Strix do you

want to touch it it's kind of gross

looking though really colds are teyla

no I'm gonna take a huge pass on

perception checks it looks like we can

all get drunk yes gone it'll be fun and

I'm fun too

oh no you look City Glen just like

[Laughter]

have a ate perception okay that's all 12

okay paulten you still haven't seen

Simon how weird I just remembered I

still haven't seen Simon well I will be

right back and I'm gonna I want it I

want to head up okay see if I can find

him yeah yes

sorry sir she's gonna drunkenly follow

okay oh you know like when your drunk

friend just like yeah and when strix

goes up the stairs drunk she like stomps

them really hard they're both going

evylyn we'll go to okay so the whole

group of you are going okay everyone be

quiet you can leave your shield

downstairs evilly yeah you do know that

Nausicaa is going to come back in about

30 seconds to the same spot yeah I'll

hold up well no he's gonna be in the

house and that's not okay um let's wait

a few seconds for him to come back and

then we politely kick him out with our

feet literally through the door okay so

he comes back it cut to him and getting

thrown out of the house with like three

sets of boots

[Laughter]

we'll call you slam slam the door yep

okay now going upstairs into Paul Tain's

room you can see that the door to the

turret is open and as you peer inside

you can hear noises up at the top of the

turret so you climb up the ladder to the

upper floor of the uppermost floor of

the turret and then you can see that

there is a hatch in the roof of the Cup

in the bottom of the cone of the turret

so there's like the turret has its own

little attic under the sloped walls of

its cone and that's where you can hear

somebody scraping about are these are

these scraping noises Simon like yes

I'm going to I'm going to go invisible

okay

oh it's wait it's still like a door I'd

have to open it well it is actually it's

like a panel like an attic panel that

you can just sort of slide away and

slide it back into place and there are

little rungs in the wall that you can

climb up to reach that panel okay so as

soon as invisible drunks trick stumbles

and it go at that point the noise up up

and the turret stops yeah I want to I

want to try to like just immediately get

in there okay when you clamor up you can

see that there is some very very old

clutter up here and there's lots of dust

and like there's a couple dead rats and

things that have died that died a long

time ago you can see some moisture has

crept in and mold kind of encrusts the

insides of the turret top which probably

needs to be replaced at some point

alright and another project here but

there is a there is in sort of in one

end of this tiny octagonal space is a

chest that looks like it has been used

open and closed recently because all the

webs and stuff have been cleared away

from it more than that

you can see that there are holes that

have been drilled into its curved top

and the drill the hand drill is actually

lying on the floor nearby just discarded

along with coils of wood do I see Simon

in here make a perception check eleven

yeah no not at first glance and he

doesn't you can't hear breathing of

course cuz he doesn't breathe hmm but

you know he's probably here somewhere

there's other junk there's other junk in

the room so you could probably just

rifle through until to see what's there

drinks floats up through the hatch on

your broom with the two of you up here

it's now quite crowded and and paltin is

you rummage through stuff you can see

underneath an old drop cloth

Simon is just

hold up there like a ball like just

hiding and then he looks up at you Simon

a smile I want to just like pick him up

and just like kind of just like just

like his lap sitting on my arm okay it's

like you turned it uh yeah when you turn

your foot kind of steps on something and

it's a plate and you can see that

there's some old food like crumbs around

the plate just like Simon I'm going to

ask you a question

knowing full well what the answer is

have you been eating food up here he

looks at you and nods yes it's in I've

been eating food with your mouth and

your digestive system you're telling me

that's what you did he sort of rotates

his head towards strix and then back to

you and it's like don't look at her look

at me no he nods okay his face it takes

his sort of downcast so he's kind of

nodding with his chin toward his chest

since trixie the chest with the holes in

it yo yeah well he was kind of like turn

to the chest and be like is there

something in there we should know about

a little strix turns and directs and

it's gonna go look at the chest holes

the way folks her head up and what's

going on it's just full also full rats

I'm also gonna walk over to chest to be

like I'm going to look in there I'm

gonna be very disappointed if you're

lying again Strix is you peer in with

your ratty dark vision you can you can

hear breathing and you can see

a shape cramped up in here all sort of

it's hard to make out details because

you're looking very closely at it and

it's filling up part of the chest that

you're in but make a perception check

strikes before paulten throws the chest

open

is that a disadvantage er no okay that

was an at twenty with that role and your

scent and your sight and all that you're

pretty sure there's a kid locked in this

job oh no you see the rats just like

scattered

yeah they scatter away they climb off

the lid as paltin kind of throws it open

and palton yeah you see that there is a

bound and gagged 11 year old boy oh I'm

so glad that idiot isn't here in this

town and look in I see this just like

Simon you can see he's nothing he's

turned his head around and is just kind

of looking at a wall now look no matter

what it is you're into I accept you and

the kid is alive by the way and is now

looking up at you palton with just

plaintive eyes evylyn goes to deal with

the child while Paul's in discipline

Simon even goes to like unbind and help

the child okay as you tear the the the

bonds off of him and remove his gag he

throws his arms around you evil and she

holds him but waits for paltin to finish

what he said to Simon she's like just

like just look it's like look the boy

says okay we we accept you for who you

are and whatever it is you're into but

the the tying stuff I feel like you're a

bit young for that okay it looks like

the notes' done and she's off the as

your rats have climbed off the chest

nurse or scuttling around you can see

stuffed behind the chest are some pieces

of paper and some pieces of charcoal or

chalk all right well I will coalesce

back into myself to read those

okay all the rats combined and assume

they're Strix like form and as you put

reach in and you start to pull papers

out behind them you can see that they

are very very crude drawings of what

appeared to be well they're really bad

drawings but make a perception check of

Strix

I'm very sober now by the way that's

only a 10 that's enough

they clearly seem to be drawings of

Simon but they look like they look

different from him a deliberate effort

to not look like shall we say a puppet

Oh Oh Simon doesn't want to be a puppet

he wants to be a person that's why he

put the person in that in the chest is

that right Simon strikes like looks over

at Simon he's not off Oh Simon halted

you have to tell him that he's just he's

like good looking everywhere except at

you palton Oh palton pölten Simon I'm

sorry I had a moment there um Simon look

at me look at me

eyes up sort of looks at you he turns

his head just around so you can kind of

look at you with one eye why do you

think you need to be anything but

yourself P mmm he doesn't really have an

answer he just sort of shrugs and hangs

his head you don't need to do that we

love you as you are also what the hell

did you actually plan to do he doesn't

really respond he's just sort of like

shrugging his shoulders that's better

than being held it the way he is we're

yes were you studying this child or were

you trying to take over this child's

body

left hand for one right hand for two he

sort of gives a shrug like he's not

exactly sure were you trying to do magic

Simon even this listen he's from one of

the worst places that we've ever been

next to when we just we met literally

the evil of all evils in a place that

was raining blood so cute we just have

this conversation about Nazca where

sometimes your circumstances make you

more likely to behave poorly but that

doesn't mean that certain things are

okay and I'm sure that his father will

discipline him for kidnapping a literal

child nice guys not living with us

evylyn just kind of glares and takes the

child down to the kitchen okay

yeah Strix is gonna follow up she's like

Simon needs to tie his problem needs to

deal with this this isn't my kid

she'll try and find some real food for

the kid so evylyn and Strix is you're

both in the kitchen with him you've sort

of got this young boy on a stool sitting

at the table in the middle of the

kitchen and strix you're bringing him

stuff and evil and you're you're kind of

sitting next to him and being comforting

he tells you that his name is martin

trek he lives in North Ward and he

misses his family very much I'm sure you

do will take you there first thing you

want just eat something and and it's

very clear to you guys too that the

unseen servants in the kitchen are still

there because they will take things away

and move things around they were not

damaged can you tell us what happened

how you ended up in that attic I was I

was I was playing with the puppet and

with with some of the other kids and he

well we went off together when the other

kids went home and we played for a while

and then he he brought me here and we he

showed me all around and we went up into

the turret and next thing I know I was

stuck inside how long have you been up

there I'm not sure David well he brought

her you'd

milk even takes a deep breath because

the gravity of this is sinking in on her

and she realizes she's going to

literally have to go to a family and

apologize for her son having kidnapped

their son and take him back

you think it's actually worse than that

evylyn kidnapping is a major crime in

Waterdeep the punishments are severe

well does

oh wait am i am i down there with them

well you're you're you're currently

upstairs you had a loan time with Simon

to discipline him okay or whatever

Paulin like notices even Li was just

like oh so when he's bad he's my son

okay that's fair hmm you just like like

it's like hmm son I just I want you to

know I'm I'm not mad I'm just drunk

I don't know how to deal with this right

now but you are going to go to your

mother

and she's going to tell you where we go

here so you go you go to her you promise

me you'll go to her yeah okay wait I'm

gonna I'm going down there too

we'll both go never mind let's go okay

so we're you just so he follows you I

guess that's the plan okay you head back

and you hear them down in the kitchen

paltin you head that way you it's not

until you get to the doorway of the

kitchen and you realize the look of

horror on the young boy's face that

you've just brought his kidnap her back

in the room with him I'm like holding

his hand I'm just like yeah it's like

you see me free and you can see the boy

he's just like petrified all of a sudden

and tries to get away even hug him like

lets him kind of Nestle

to her neck and she's like listen we

have to get this kid out of here and and

below this over before DeMuth gets back

he can't find out that there was a kid

in a cage of this house everyone's gonna

find out he's he can't find out we have

to go to Kandahar I'll stand trial this

is a major offense wait wait he's gonna

what now almost certainly he wouldn't

stand trial he would be destroyed he's

gonna have to stand trial like a normal

human person if we can prove that he has

a sold and he can stand trial like a

normal human person well that's what

we'd have to do how does it work with

juveniles in Waterdeep would it be his

parents well it was so the the crime

itself carries very stiff sentences

anywhere from imprisonment and hard

labor to depending on the individual in

this case if unless Martin's like the

son of a nobleman or something chances

are wouldn't be death it would be some

sort of fine paid to the family as well

as imprisonment flogging and potentially

hard labor however this is a construct

the magistrate may interpret that may

instead say the construct is the

property of the kidnapper or kidnappers

and so they would be put on trial and

the construct would be destroyed evylyn

explains all of this Waterdeep law to

Halton Strix so if you could not prove

that the construct acted autonomously

you would be put on trial which honestly

is probably better if we don't want

Simon to be destroyed so you or I or

somebody here is up for trial for

kidnapping hmm kids you want to be an

apprentice and no magic even looks at

him like that

how does that sound okay the kid is

horrified because he's not saying

anything

you just assess you evil and very

quietly in your ear I want to go home I

know you do I'm gonna take you home

right now hold on hold on wait wait no

idea no idea I have an idea Simon looks

at paltin confused we can there's got to

be a spell that we can just wipe his

memory and he'll send it back home we're

not gonna wipe his memory we'll just

hang them out and then it'll be fine

maybe for his own good you can't you

said Simon to it or while we discussed

this please I mean you go to your room

and you stay there and you wait ah there

please mister it's like all strikes goes

up to Paulson is like Paulson just use

you suggested on the kit that doesn't

work Simon relief lately as the kid

relax

yes I'm gonna take you home right away

we're just figuring out how to talk to

your parents about this because of

course we will take responsibility for

our child's actions and then at least

you won't remember being in a cage if we

find some way to you know get inside

check evylyn this is not a hard one I

mean it's not hard to read a kid 13 you

see doubts in Martin's mind that that

thing could possibly be your son well it

is a little complicated we have to take

him home there's nothing we can do what

evylyn you have to do it because you are

a pal and er if I do it I'm literally

going to look like a forest hag they

kidnapped a child with them I am aware

of what I look like and I know what's

gonna happen and I just like or just a

side thought

and I like Bend I like cover the kids

here it's like you see one of the unseen

servants drops a jug evylyn slap dalton

across the face I deserved that

that's careful she looks at him like she

has never seen him before and walks out

of the room he's like okay oh wait you

took the kid yeah she's going to

take him to his parents right now that's

apparently I'm dealing with this alone

though strict strict skin shadow which

kids shadow her but she's not gonna go

up to the parents door because she again

she looks like she's going to eat the

child like yeah even the leaves is just

like good dad kids aren't that weird in

this campaign are they I guess I'm just

dealing with this all by myself

as you walk out of the kitchen into the

tack room you see that the front door is

hanging open that's good uh front doors

hanging open

yep and it's still sort of swinging like

it just got thrown open and left open

it's kind of swinging shut slowly do I

see anyone else in the tap room no hey

guys the doors open I'm gonna go get

home oh yeah fine oh I'll go with some

weekend hey there's I don't know there's

a lot of people there's a lot of things

going on in this house I just kind of

accepted do I see anyone around do I

notice anything okay uh no way is Simon

where Simon you sent him to his room

your room oh that's not what I asked

can I check scientists see if Simon went

to his room he did not

okay should I get on my broom and I'm

like I'm gonna find him I'm gonna use a

can I use a locate creature yes you can

cool oh if you do that if you do that

constricts will hand you her broom and

say you go find him

if he's still in a thousand feet of you

you'll be able to know where he is in

the direction he's moving come on he's

not that fast

no he's loud yellow legs yeah so you

cast the spell you concentrate he is

clearly moving away from the manor

running away as fast as he can he's out

in the city now and he's only maybe like

a hundred and twenty feet away by the

time you well you have to get misspell

let me just see how long a stall that

takes to cast and then that will

determine how far away is he'll still be

within range and all likelihood no you

can cast it as an action so yeah so he's

he's you know maybe a hundred and twenty

feet away and moving what appears to be

his full speed away from the house okay

oh I'll take the broom all right and hop

on it this is the this is the whole

parent like driving around them so

you're gonna like saddle up outside yeah

I'll saddle up outside okay when you do

there's a big puff of smoke

you take to the air some people notice

you do this now people in Waterdeep tend

to be pretty nonplussed about things so

mostly they just look to see what's

going on and as you rock it up in the

air and follow the spell you can see

Simon sort of running out an alley and

into the street and into the path of an

incoming coach can I try and swoop down

and grab him

you sure can so

you barrel down a big trail of smoke

behind you through under this sort of

overpass and then come at him from

behind to grab him out of the path of

these charging horses and he stops and

stands in front of the horses as they

barrel toward him and I would like you

to make a roll and this will be any

strength athletics check you grab him

and out of the way mere seconds before

he is pulverized under horse hooves and

now I'd like you to make a dexterity

saving throw seventeen you also avoid

crashing into the wall of a building as

you suddenly go vertical ah your feet

literally dance across dances across the

facade of the building as you see but it

just like you haven't you like ascends

up and I just like kind of float bridges

notice the thing this this is a very

unstable ride with Simon on it because

it technically doesn't support two

creatures mm-hmm oh yeah you still

hardly I'll just land wherever I can

nearby sure there's a roof it is cool I

just land on the roof holding I'm just

like what why did you do that what what

are you doing you can't can't just run

off like that

you you you scared me so bad and you

almost died again god I hate that that's

a phrase that I use so often um

he's shaking his head I just like I just

like pull him in and hug him just like

don't do that again

he doesn't reciprocate he just sort of

hangs there while you have him

please don't do that again it's like

holding him from me please sigh man he's

like he's like looking down the rooftop

looks back to you like kind of scoot him

farther away okay yeah you get a sense

that he's like measuring the rooftop to

see if maybe I might kill him let's go

home okay he just sulks but you do get

him back evylyn yeah as soon as he

leaves to go find Simon I leave with

Strix if she's coming to go take the kid

home

well Strix is debating on whether or not

to clean up the Attic just so that Dina

doesn't see it I'm still asked evil and

like should we do this look he didn't go

into the Attic enough times to find out

there was a kid there so I doubt they'll

be wanting to go into that right now and

by the way he's gonna find out anyway so

up to you I mean I know what it's like

to clean for catharsis so if you just

need to clean something then go ahead

but I'm different evidence I don't know

that's that's a very good question in

your mind even if the kid were to go to

court and report what happened to him

almost certainly the authorities would

want to see the scene of the crime

I think you should leave it exactly how

it is and I'm gonna go take this kid

home and you're welcome to come with me

or you should go help fault and find

Simon I won't come with you alright they

don't let them see me cuz I know how

that goes are the two of you going on

foot are you taking lance in then Lance

okay I tell I don't tell Lance the whole

story though cuz he's new and I don't

want him to judge us right you can see

that Martin is strangely kind of

fascinated by Lance like he

there's something maybe the kid just

likes animals you're not sure but before

he actually gets in the wagon he does

kind of walk up to the mule and kind of

put his hand up on the Mules nose and

and Lance is very patiently just sort of

sniffing is actually licks the kids hand

and the kid a smile crosses Martin's

face for the first time that you've seen

you like you like lamps

I think Lance likes you too mm-hmm you

guys can be friends he smiles so gloomy

like I need juniper Oh she gives you

juniper yeah likes animals so just like

look here's a little mouse her name's

Jennifer do you want a holder he looks

and says oh that's really cute

guy see ya he doesn't pet he pets her

very gently he seems to be really really

kind with critters he likes animals hi

Jennifer

ah um so Martin who's your family he

tells you that his family lives about a

block and a half to the east they have a

nice house but it's it's small he says

that he's got a mother and a father he

tells you their names you've never heard

of them before and you probably won't

remember them a day from now but he also

says they live with their aunt and he

has an older sister who is a bit of a

jerk and I don't I don't like recognize

their family name or anything like that

no you don't they don't strike you as

anybody important but he tells you that

his father leaves town occasionally he

is a a caravan master well we gotta go

tell your parents what happened you can

hang out with juniper you can hold her

while we go there yeah he sits in the

back of the wagon with juniper in his

hand I'm talking to her okay and you can

see the ride there it's like nothing

happened

he has being out in the wagon which he

likes being in a safe place all these

things the small mouse the the Merc mule

it's almost like you know this is

there's no indication this kid has

suffered any stress in this moment

because he's so comfortable that's good

yeah all right I take I take him to his

house all right you can see it's a it's

a tidy modest estate with not much of a

yard

there are sown old stone steps leading

up to the front doors and then there's

these sort of iron wrought prongs that

come off on each side of the door that

have lanterns hanging from them and you

can see there's a nameplate on the door

indicating that it is a residence and

the family name is imprinted upon it I

knock on the door and I hope I hold

marked him in front of me like my hands

on his little shoulders an older woman

you'd say too old to be his mother

probably his aunt comes to the door and

you can see she's got a pipe and she's

smoking it

and she opens and she says your mother

has been looking for you where have you

been you haven't been down by the docks

again have you she'll be furious and

Martin kinda looks up at you and goes no

I was just staying over with a friend

you were you yeah I mean and and this is

this is his mother evylyn and she just

wanted to make sure I got back safe what

what does even I can even roll a

religion check sure others like well you

got there that's out of my domain

well basically she's trying to decide

whether like every child has the

autonomy to decide how they want to deal

with their family or whether the truth

she should tell the parents

so this is she is looking to the

teachings of Lysander to figure out what

her conscience should do yes given the

circumstances you can make a religion

check fifteen okay this is highly

irregular under normal circumstances

your faith would advocate for honesty

but plain honesty is never you shouldn't

just consider that the blind one

solution to all of life's problems

because people are much more complicated

than that you also think that this just

could be Providence that you know you

that this child has responded so well to

you and trust you so implicitly that he

doesn't want to see you put in any

jeopardy and so he's kind of

surprisingly mature for a kid his age

but he seems to be willing to let

bygones be bygones so that you don't you

don't have to go to prison a kid can I

also roll insight on like he seems kind

of scared of this person going tonight

yeah can I get insight on basically like

usually his realization yeah also at

this point Strix is sitting in the wagon

or the mule and just looking like this

like sad image of morovia just like on

the wagon just like looking back and

there's like one cloud in the sky - and

it's just shining its shadow down the

corner yeah like she's just like can we

just not have this happen like she was

talking to herself

people are walking by on the sidewalk

and hearing you're talking to herself -

so and they just give her sad looks

yeah I just she's just staring at this

happening okay I got nineteen insight uh

Martin sort of rolled his eyes when he

realized his aunt came to the door and

your assessment of the relationship is

he's got a happy home life he's given a

fair amount of autonomy there's no

indication of abuse in both in either

and he either in his personality or in

his physical form before you and you

think that he's just the impression is

he wishes his aunt would find her own

damn place to live

all right well so having taken a moment

and kind of like giving him a meaningful

look kind of winked at him okay and then

she's like we had a great time

but I knew that his family would miss

him so of course I brought him home but

you know Martin you are welcome to come

play with juniper or Lance or you know

any of us any time and you see him look

at you and he he still got juniper in

his hand and he says I'll take really

good care of her I promise well you need

to understand about juniper she has

their beliefs she eats a lot she sleeps

a lot and she does nothing other than

eat and sleep and enjoy herself

you could you could come by tomorrow and

give me a list and I swear I'll follow

it I'll follow it more closely than

anything I've ever followed before she

won't misses she won't miss a meal

I promise evylyn even gets down next to

juniper and looks at her and she says

juniper do you care at all where you

live the mouse is just about six just

sort of hanging out in his hand and it's

sort of half sleeping sleeping in his

hand just sort of opens a little red eye

and looks at you and just sort of

Juniper I knew that you were brought

back to life for a reason

and I knew that we knew each other for a

reason and it looks like this child who

needs love and a companion is the Reed I

think this is meant to be she kind of

scratches her behind the ear that also

makes it way easier for us to wrap up

this very inconvenient plot point a

little paltin rubbing off on here I'm

just like where he is just like senses

something's like what happened yeah I

think even says that man she's like what

so since juniper seems happy and it

makes the kids so happy even like kind

of just melts and she kind of wipes a

little too

but she's like this will be a good place

for her looks like home for sure I mean

she has been riding around inside

Ethan's breastplate and like almost

getting killed consistently for like a

year

so you know anyone can feed her and let

her sleep so that'll be good she'll be

safer here

so she says yes of course I'm kind of

like waves happily to him and says come

by anytime and bring juniper to say how

I will and he runs into the house even

uh the the aunt just sort of lets out a

puff of smoke and closes the door Wow

evylyn kind of like looks a tiny bit

like she looks hard but crestfallen you

know just like well that well Trix is

like all right when when's the court

date there won't be any court never has

to find out I would say that we should

tell him but he has been keeping a lot

from us yeah we can't I just do you see

how sad he is all the time now that I

like feel weird

I noticed that he's really sad all the

time yeah maybe we should do something

nice for him not telling him about a kid

in a cage is probably number one that's

true sometimes it's okay to not be a

hundred percent honest I mean it's not

like lying so much is just protecting I

don't know that feels a little morally

and yeah great but I have had a lot of

decisions made already today and I think

we should just go home let's go just

like well by the way I saw you gave him

juniper to the kid I'm actually pretty

thankful for that we have way too many

parents you return back to your waffle

house Simon paltin have returned

evylyn looks relieved but sad like she's

putting on a brave face yes yeah Paulson

you used you read in this situation

something terrible has happened what

happened evil inhale all of all the

blood

is rushed from her face oh my god

they're gonna they're gonna put deaath

on trial

no no they I just it was actually I mean

it's it's really hard to say I let him

keep juniper you're like who the is

to wait I I know who juniper is right I

have to say it's like I know he's

periodically evil and like feeds him

feeds her little morsels of food yeah

it's like what yeah why cause he wanted

he was attached to her I don't know so

you so you you gave your pet to the to

the kid yeah oh my god Toy Story 3 does

well played

I knew I couldn't trust that kid at

least like you know he just told them he

was playing with Simon and so that

part's fine yeah but now he's got

leverage and that's never that's never

good especially in a kid marriage I'm

sorry in advance that business whips

tricks is doing you here a really a

large explosion

she cast fireball into the turret oh

holy

[Laughter]

alright so there's this blast yes I'm

gonna run up bits of turret rained down

into the alley and the street around the

building and you now have this ruthless

tower smoldering on the edge of your

estate constricts it's all turns and

she's gonna look at Paul's gonna be like

he's facing your roof down don't let him

out of your sight

it wasn't a fixer-upper when we got here

now it's gone

evidence is gone the cage is gone

everything's gone Wow okay out on the

street these little burning pieces of

paper of Simon is a little boy sort of

fall down in flames even even looks at

all this and then looks at the bar and

she's like how do you do this can I

would she get the bottle how do you know

evylyn when you go to the bar you see

that there is something sticking in it

that wasn't there before and it is a

knife oh good

and under that knife pinned to the bar

is a piece of paper mm-hmm

because you know what I haven't dealt

with enough today I'm really excited to

find out what this is

this paper stuck with a knife to my bar

look at it and it says well first of all

there's a symbol on it that looks like a

circle with ten spokes radiating out

from it equidistantly and above that

simple

symbol are written the words I have your

like an armored combat chair that would
