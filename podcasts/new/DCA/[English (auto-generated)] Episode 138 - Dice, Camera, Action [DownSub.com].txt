hi everybody and welcome to our

sub-optimal list episode ever well it

was a good show Thanks yes that's it

mm-hmm yep

sorry that was a substandard

introduction it's not Kate's fault but

you can blame Kate look I believe in

Chris's own power of punished or his

power to punish us flag all right

previously in dice camera action Strad

Vaughn Sarah vets was abducted and as

the whole thing was quick to point out

this will not stand and the waffle crew

set out to recover the chair

particularly after realizing that the

waffle kids had gone off on their own

adventure to try to retrieve it all

paths led to well it was all downhill

from there literally as the party went

down from their high hole to the docks

and used spells to track the kids to a

submarine mounted on the underside of

Joel axles flagship the eye catcher

there was a bit of a moment with jarl

axle and paltin and then they had a bit

of a row before paltin left to join

evylyn row yeah to join evylyn in the

bowels of the ship after dealing with

some ship spiders they made their way

down into Jarl Axl's boudoir and well

evylyn just totally ravaged the place

you mean she used her powers as a

representative of the city to conduct a

search thorough and bestia no yes

chopped all up relax those furnitures up

into little teeny-weeny bits and they

discovered a hatch in the floor lead

down to the submarine while that was

going on Strix and deaath assumed sealed

form becoming SEAL team Strix they

headed out to sea had a brief encounter

with a dragon that ate a shark that was

haunting them before they dove down

below peered through window of the

submarine and then misty stepped inside

where they proceeded to free the

children from their bonds and Strix and

squidly had a very touching moment when

squit Ren Strix said it was ok for

squiddly to think of her his mom only if

he's quiet for an if he's quiet right

forever so you are on the upper deck of

this two decks submarine

evylyn and palton are out in the hall

Strix and DF are in one of the cabins

having just freed Jenks and Simon from

their ropes there is a bridge at one end

of the hall where Strix you went

actually at the very end of the last

episode now that I remember yeah I went

onto the bridge onto the flying deck

looked down below to see some gnomes at

a console and a pair of drow and yeah

you told them what did you tell them I

told them we were pirates

we were pirates and no one move right no

one moved were pirates goes together

pirates yes and I have to roll

initiative for them to see how they

where they land ok but I was using an

intimidation check so right I was

planning to dating them ok you can make

that intimidation check ok

um that's 94 okay

wait 25 actually the they do seem very

taken aback by you you were like the

last creature they were expecting to

scream at them from the flying deck

ah and they kind of give each other a

quizzical luck it looks like they might

have thought about attacking you in that

moment

but you'd gave them pause and although

they draw their hand crossbows and load

them they do not immediately seem to be

turning them against you you also really

startled the two gnomes one of whom was

sitting at these controls at the front

of the sub at the front of the bridge

and another one was sort of embedded

underneath the console with feet

sticking out that one sort of comes

rolling out wide-eyed and looks up at

you and the other one turns and has got

big goggles on and looks up at you as

well and they look genuine I was

terrified oh yeah those two I'm just

like no you know you're good we need we

need you to write to fly the ship you

you two and I point at The Drowsy oh you

go upstairs you go you leave and yeah

Wow okay

that's your action to intimidate paltin

you're in the hallway yeah strict sort

of went past you to go up to the bridge

the other direction of the hallway when

you look back you hear the door that you

had closed the airlock door open with a

minka thunk and the wheel turning and a

figure stepped onto the submarine from

the airlock that is familiar to you and

it is the clockwork swordsman that I met

up in Jarl Axel's

moving very very quietly except for this

soft whirring noise that you hear it's

internal gears you surmise and it now

stands at the opposite end of the hall

would I consider its its posture

inviting yeah as it steps into the hall

and it sees you standing there it draws

its rapier and does a little flash a

flourish cutting the air and pointing it

at you I look to them I'm just like hey

before we do that quick question you

know your challenge rating offhand like

I can't really get a read on yeah but it

is your turn okay it does not respond to

you and you're not sure it has the

capacity to okay great well I'm gonna go

ahead oh I'm so scared of this thing I'm

just I'm gonna try and like talk to her

first to be like look this was a

complete misunderstanding

we were abiding by the rules and we were

told we're allowed down here so we're

just trying to go about our business and

leave okay if you like you can make a

persuasion check I would god I would

love to okay seventeen

okay it kind of takes a couple takes one

step back assumes a very upright posture

and just sort of taps its sword down so

its point touches the floor and it just

sort of strikes a pose and then seems to

 its head up and consider the words

I would also like to convey what I said

to everyone else here certainly

everybody can hear you having this

conversation isn't that right everyone

and that brings us to evylyn your muted

sorry about stepping away was are we we

were in like the driving area the bridge

right restricts was you're actually in

the hallway behind her between some

cabins and I'm with paltin yeah and you

see this clockwork swordsman has just

come through the same access hatch that

you guys did at the far end of the hall

the opposite end of this hall from the

bridge great okay and evylyn is just

finished searching Jarl Axl's room and

she's on official paladin business now

so she says yes of course we have

permission to be down here this is

official City business when she walks

toward the just turns on her heel and

walks away toward the bridge bridge yeah

okay then you can get there and look

down into the bridge to see two gnomes

two Dark Elves and a lot of flashing

blinking lights consoles and things and

I see Strix down there Strix is on the

same level you are which is this deck

that comes out over the bridge it's

called a flying deck because it's sort

of held up by pillars and is one level

above the rest of the bridge but it is

inside the larger bridge room and this

flying deck that you're on has two

chairs both swivel chairs that are

mounted to the deck you can see what

looks like a periscope

above one of them and there's a railing

that looks down on to the rest of the

deck and there are two ladders behind

these chairs that drop down to the lower

deck where the drow and the gnomes are

does this look like it's where like a

captain might sit yeah captain and a

first officer

evylyn brings tricks with her like hello

I am your interim captain

evylyn maher zain I will be taking

control of this vessel it's time to

depart please take your stations

we're pirates no more pilots we're

absolutely not pirates we have oh I mean

what either way this vessel is and we

are taking it to the appropriate ease

for inspection I don't think either way

is gonna work with the drow Death what

do you do you're in the cabin with the

kids right and that's a great question

I guess I'll just kind of take a moment

and just tell the kids to stay here and

be safe then I'll go into the hall and

find palton okay you step out into the

hall leaving the kids in the room

together yeah and paltin is standing

there talking down a clockwork swordsman

yeah I was looking at my previous notes

and I wrote down oh there's a mechanical

swordsman and I was like that's weird

why did I write that down oh whatever

and here we are here we are now it's it

is roughly 30 feet away from you

I'm actually closer to about 1 5 10 15

about 20 feet away from you at the other

end of the hall from the bridge all

right yeah I guess there's close one

you're closer to evil in Strix than you

are to it right now yeah I wanted to

find paltin he's right there he's it

right out in the hall with you yeah and

just ask him

alton i still trying to get the chair

dude they like the chair alright i

can reanimate whatever chair i just want

to get the kids i want to get out of

here i don't want to die and i thinks

the scariest thing I've ever seen okay

okay I just just wanted to make sure I

know it's important to you fine we'll

find another chair it's fine it's a prop

okay I guess I'll go to the bridge and

also act important okay so three of you

are up on the flying bridge now I'm

still tween us all our persuasion is

pretty high we're pirates

I guess it's it's sad beard the other

pirate again pirates don't even have a

beard that's why it's sad

do you still have an action you see that

these although they were a little

intimidated at first the Strix is

pronouncement was enough to kind of

strike momentary fear in them when you

come out on the deck you see that fear

is mostly past at this point what see

that she bought she bought around but

these are Dark Elves these these guys

are nasty boogeyman mind yeah I guess do

that

do they look equipped at all yeah you

can see that they're wearing studded

leather armor they've got buckler

shields that have this sort of web-like

motif strapped to one of their arms and

in the other they're holding hand

crossbows they've also got shiny short

swords strapped to their belts okay

oh I don't want to start a fight in here

because it's a small awkward sub I think

bad but I guess I'll I guess it'll use

the rest of my actions to basically

approach one of the Dark Elves

okay and just kind of like get up next

to them not like going up there to

attack Rome or anything just kind of get

up so they're on the level below you

yeah yeah you'll have to basically slide

down the ladder and land on the main

deck but you at least look like you can

absolutely get up to them bases get up

next to them so that they're you know if

they try to take out their crossbow to

shoot I'm like they're to react

okay well they've already got the

crossbows out okay well if they try to

point the crossbows to shoot there okay

just if they have more pressing matters

all right at which point the gnome and

the chair sort of says right and the

other one says this is dangerous

there's no need for there to be a fight

we're just taking this vessel to the

proper authorities everyone man your

stations stay calm no need for fighting

you know we're not pirates anymore I

guess no need for fighting no mutt need

for fight ago Strix what do you do all

right well no no one listened to me DF

is now down on the main deck no no wanna

listen to me I'm very upset it I thought

we were pirates one day for everyone

welcome to my world so I'm just

gonna try and polymorph those two dark

girls with the twin spell pop I'm Lloyd

polygons and so they both have to make

yeah so they're trying to beat 17 now I

think I'm 17 oh yeah

okay and what are you attempting to turn

them into

I guess we're underwater that doesn't

really matter I don't know

mice let's say mice you cast the spell

you can see that it looks like they're

getting ready to draw their swords to

leave but before they can draw their

swords to confront DF they both turn

into mice yeah I said now none of that

there doesn't have to be any fighting no

none of that

I'll just let him go don't pick them up

evil and they're not pets one of the one

of the gnomes

well actually the one in the chair will

hop out and go over to one of the mice

and start chasing it around okay no

don't touch that please just leave it

alone sir or ma'am I don't know I

haven't just what no don't hurt the mice

the gnome will stop when you say that

okay just leave them alone but we need

you to run this ship because we need to

pull it off away no one okay okay yeah

good thank you

um here have a snack and I'll hand them

yeah he'll share it with his friend

all right good that's I feel like my

round is over

all right the gnome will then say and

there's another growl on the ship oh

great we're all right oh well good thing

that first defense officer paltin is on

the case okay that's a real ship thing

first defence officer I'm sure of it

who is the captain that was me I told

you I'm captain Marth Aine acting

captain marthy the gnome says

your orders to decouple from this ship

and proceed to the proper authorities

okay well the Nome will sit back in the

chair the other noon will quickly

scuttle under the console again and

mutter something about attaching some

wires but he immediately starts to since

it's their turn move some levers and

controls and the all of you are sort of

jarred as the vehicle moves and there

there is also a decoupling noise from

somewhere on the roof of the vessel

paltin you're out in the hallway yeah as

the vessel begins to move

there is a gushing sound of water and

then it immediately comes pouring into

the hallway through the open door that

the mechanical man is standing in front

of I thought we closed that oh yeah he

lifted he left the door open

yeah so so this is always on this ship

that knows how it works

left the door he knows connects that you

didn't even have a time to close it and

you can see the water start to pour

through there's no there's these I'm

just gonna say these gnomes that drive

this ship don't have any kind of like

check system to make sure that it's like

ready to go nope and well you didn't

give the specific order yeah well I mean

captain evylyn doesn't congestus i'm

just wouldn't be like when I say leave I

mean comic-con

blood this just just let me dress

yeah any mechanical man as the water

crashes into the hallway just kind of

stands there and just sort of tries to

brace itself as the water is gushing in

around it so I'm in this hall that's

filling with water

is this the entryway to like where

everyone else is is that like is that

open so they're all in the bridge which

is behind you the water is eventually

going to flow in that direction you can

see that right now the r8 is gushing in

it could flood the entire submarine in a

matter of rounds can perfect good oh

wait it's not my turn and it is now your

turn okay um can I animate object the

door shut hey only if you come up with a

good name for it or the door it's a

medium-sized object I'm fine I'm just

saying Dorothy

[Laughter]

okay

that was good yeah well that's a good

question it's a construct

if it lacks legs or other appendages it

instead has a flying speed Oh Alice I

gotta help this is attached if the

object is securely attached to a surface

such as a chain bolted to a wall speed

is zero so yeah you can definitely try

to command it to close now here's the

thing this is a medium object its

strength is 10 it has to make a strength

check to try to close against the tide

that it's up against so roll a d20 and

the strength is 10 add nothing to it

okay

that was on the side inspire your door

alright cool so big no okay so your

weak-ass door is not able to close

itself because of the force of the water

at least not without help well do I have

movement you do can I get the hell out

of that hall you have a couple options

one you can leap into one of the cabins

to either side of you both have open

doors one has all four kids in it and

one is empty and you think that these

doors might be airtight

or you could head to the bridge which

has no door leading to it and be with

your friends okay and by now the water

is already coursing past your feet sweet

so I'm gonna go to the bridge okay and

do ice do I see evylyn yeah she's on the

flying deck that you now find yourself

standing on she's got a door open you

strung go close now the water is pouring

over Paul tans feet over strix his feet

and over the flying deck onto the floor

of the bridge it looks at her crew and

goes I'm very disappointed in you and

then runs the water poured in before I

got there right yeah yes I was like hey

but you are definitely moving and all of

you who are except evylyn who has just

retreated back down the hall to try to

close this stupid door the rest of you

can see the gleaming of some metallic

scales out through one of the big

circular windows on the bridge no but

like what if we didn't look like a big

dragon swimming by

can I have to press my face against the

window and try and wave it it you're too

fond the flying deck you can't reach the

window can I'm misty step to the window

you could but you'd have to be on the

lower level

Oh otherwise you'd fall can I cast run

from Dragon there good good it's fine

there nice one of the one of the the

gnome who's gotten her head underneath

the console says please focus on making

this vessel safe

please can you maybe like you're not

there even oh did I already move yeah

and it's actually your attorney now so

if you want to get up to the door and

try to close it that's fine the problem

yes is that there is a clockwork

swordsman standing next to the door I'm

wondering if the clockwork swordsman

also wants the door closed you don't

know well I'm gonna assume that he has

some sort of like self-preservation

instinct and I'm gonna try to as I'm

running toward the door yell help me get

this door closed and just try to recruit

him as I go toward the door you can go

ahead and make a persuasion check would

that be my action no because I want my

action to be closing yeah that's fair

okay so no persuasion check if you close

the door and it wants to take an

opportunity attack against you at Ken

that's fine okay it does stop that you

can idiot so it attempts to pierce you

with its rep here and it's gonna roll it

21 known its attack role I don't think I

think that that hit okay yeah then it

does 15 points of piercing damage to you

sticking through your armor into your

flesh as you attempt to close the door

look I know being a construct can be

hard sometimes but that doesn't give you

an excuse to try to kill us all so

please help me shut this door or you

will die along with all of us in this

watery prison all right there is so much

water coming through the ie the entire

Bay that this is this is gonna be a

tricky thing for you evylyn but go ahead

you're super strong give it a go the

door is trying to help me though because

it's animated door is animated and it

does want to close itself so you are

being aided by it we always get these

weird snoring oh noes Oh neat

the granite die don't lie okay so you

give it a good old thing and then you

are sort of shocked shocked when you

become sort of pinned between the wall

and the door just embrace the flood and

by now there is just this massive

waterfall coming up over the flying deck

and falling onto the bridge below do I

see her fail miserably every sign points

to yes I am so upset Boulton just like

falls into this despair like all the all

the hope leaves his face you just like

embrace the flood just let the waters of

faith fill your no wait

wouldn't I have advantage because the

door was trying to aid me yeah oh you

get another roll come on okay what's my

strength I mm-hmm

that's gonna be actually a 23 Chris

Perkins oh so we got a glimpse into an

alternate universe but in this one 20:23

is pretty good but it's not enough

what to think to the bottom of the ocean

that is alright

it is the clockwork swordsman's turn

evil in it will attack you three times

so dumb we're all gonna die she doesn't

say this anna says this alright it

Pierce's you three times successfully

the first attack does

14 the second attack does 16 so that's

30 and the third attack does 12 so a

total of 42 points of damage I don't

feel so good

what is the strength modifier of the

ocean

yeah well the funny thing is it'll

become easier once the ship is flooded

yeah exactly we just let it happen we

get what we want yeah so there's about a

foot of water on the main deck now there

are two little mice swimming around in

it good there is a gnome who is

operating on a console underwater

practically and the other one is seating

in his chair and actually he'll raise

his chair up a few inches for the crank

and then we come to Dee a stern

I mean I mean now hope Evelyn had made

the order that ever that the people

driving should try to like make make us

seaworthy so whether that's like surface

right away or whatever she made it clear

that that's was what she wanted to do if

that helps you try to like lead them to

do anything yeah waters pouring in if we

can get to this surface so that our

water hole is no longer below of water

that would at least stop that for a

little bit

mm-hmm you can tell we're really worthy

of captaining this ship because we're

talking about our water well hey this is

gonna ask what's a torpedo oh the the

gnome the gnome will tell you that it

exactly what it is that is it is a

guided missile armed with smoke powder

it just for a moment yeah it's just like

that but yeah he'll just be like yeah

you heard the captain

get us to the surface away from the

monster dragon scales underwater and the

the vehicle you can feel start to go up

it's just like pointing oh wow yep

you're pointing around your singing

blinking lights yeah he also see a map

on this deck on the one wall like one of

those you know like emergency exit maps

on buildings and things I quickly study

this map alright very good

and then

Strix and deaath you see a hatch on the

lower level that you're on open up this

is a hatch leading from the bridge to

the mess hall and the third drought

comes out there is this one appears to

be dressed as a wizard and immediately

casts a spell like counter spell alright

go ahead and make your check because

this is a fifth level spell wait wait

hold on hold on last time I did this it

didn't need to be done maybe they're

getting rid of the water yeah maybe yeah

maybe someone has some self-preservation

instinct in this battle hopefully yeah

maybe they're getting rid of what can I

tell what spell they're casting or that

you can do with an Arcana okay all right

I'm gonna do that first that's a 12 you

don't know okay I'm not gonna counter

spell them yet I'm just gonna let them

do it all right I'm not gonna waste that

slot in case they might be

self-preservation preserving us I'm

learning because last time I messed up

real bad and I did this it is in this

case it is you find out that it is not a

friendly spell it is a cloud kill a

demon a cloud of poisonous yellow green

fog fills the entire bridge

self-preservation that's the opposite I

need you and dia and actually paltin as

well because he's on the flying deck of

the bridge to make constitution saving

throws the gnomes do as well as do the

mice I just says Perkins calm down okay

well I didn't know so Constitution

saving throws for everybody but II

believe okay that would be 11:14 okay

also 14 right yes 14 okay that's not

enough so you are all you're all choking

on Aizen vapors cool hold on

yeah 19 used my fancy dice my divine

dice so that I wanted okay so you're

gonna take half damage and okay so

that's right so that will be 30 points

of damage for DF and paltin neat and 15

points of poison damage for you Strix he

and the cloud is still there the two

mice turned back into Dark Elves because

they took enough damage to turn them

back and the gnomes are dead and start

floating on the water

[Laughter]

alright oh I have to just try something

here odd or even before the last gnome

died he sort of pulled on a crank and

the submarine just starts to go down

okay it's not reverse controls he pulls

on it goes up I just rolled randomly so

you feel the submarines start to go down

and the cloud is still there

that's his turn Strix you start your

turn in the cloud I need you to make

another saving through about 12 okay you

take some more damage okay

you take 33 points of death poison go

alright hold on

so a total of 48 cool okay um I would

like to dispel this okay go ahead and

make a dispel check yeah

wait as my staff well how do I do that

hold on so it's a for you it will be

dc-10 plus the spells level okay your

spell ability okay so the spell level is

a third level currently but I can cast

it at higher level if I feel so inclined

the spell saw using a fourth level or

higher you automatically end the effects

of a spell

equal to or less than the level of the

spell slot you used so you can use a

fifth level spell slot yeah I sure would

like to do that okay to get rid of that

default actually this is from the staff

you said yeah isn't it folks it's not

based on well all right I'm not sure but

I think I had just been using them as

normal spells but it could be that

they're fixed I'm not sure I've just

been treating them as normals oh you use

your spell casting ability so yeah so

you can do that oh but I know it's yeah

so go ahead and roll a you can't

increase the level of this spell okay

from the staff so just use your spell

casting ability 10 plus or sorry it's an

ability check so for you that would be

charisma

it so just ten plus my charisma modifier

that's it so it's 15 okay so yeah so

it's 15 okay you dispel the cloud don't

thank God all right okay all right right

I mean they're there whatever can I do

him any kind of movement to like run up

to the console and because the vehicle

is now sort of going down all the water

is tumbling toward that part of the ship

so the console is actually underwater by

the time you get to it you'll have to go

down into the water to operate it okay

I'm gonna go do that all right

make an Arcana check to operate this

vehicle you watch the gnome do it for

all of 10 seconds I sure did but he was

really annoying so okay never mind I

don't do it today it rolled that what

there was a 20 and then it just tumbled

onto it - okay roll a d20 for me just

tell me what you get a 16 okay you can't

hear it terribly well because you're

underwater but you can hear it sort of

but a very loud clack song goes off

throughout the entire ship

uh-huh

you think you might have turned that on

but you're not sure how to turn it off

okay oh okay well alright I'm just

pushing buttons underwater just holy

neighbours pushing buttons you thought

maybe pulling that won't work but then

you didn't seem to do anything right

away so you pushed another button and

yeah and then you don't remember what

you did that's it for you we are oh the

two Dark Elves who are now no longer

mice DF all right they are going to swim

over to you and actually no they're

going to one of them will come over to

you the other one will go over to Strix

the one that comes over to you pulls out

a short sword and tries to stab you

twice

with a DF he ruled a 23 on the first

attack in a natural one on the second

the one misses right the 23 does five

points of normal damage I'm gonna say

the poison he had applied to his blade

has been washed off by the water so it

just does five points of damage and it's

at attack I barely uncanny dodged it all

right Strix you are also one of them

tries to stab you while you're operating

the controls or also 14 to hit something

I just like kick him like stop you take

six points of damage right devoted

protectors man yes I did break all their

lost statues you yeah and then okay so

next up is Pauling okay or these lot of

water yeah it's so so so it's filling up

and these drow are still just like on

the whole stab yeah they're basically

swimming through the swing through the

water and stabbing your friends to death

are those two as well as the construct

like are they like within hearing range

of me yes from the lifejacket from the

flying deck it you have really good

acoustics up here you could be heard

extremely well cool I'm just gonna be

like dudes look I know you want to do

the stab stab and the killer kill but

holy

this thing's filling up so we're all

gonna die regardless so if you dumbass

want to die with us I'm down with that

because I probably mind less than you do

but i really suggest you spend this time

trying to figure out how we don't drown

and if you want we get up there then we

can fight does that sound good

did you want to sort of try to make a

persuasion check is that your goal

actually I'm gonna make that math

suggestion just to be like hey if you

don't want to die then maybe like save

it all right the drow have advantaged

because their fate ancestry charm spells

well it's a DC 20 the two Dark Elves

that you can see suddenly think it's a

good idea to stop attacking your friends

yeah thank you if you know how to bring

this thing up you do that and then we

can go back the stabby stab okay evylyn

Oh before I get there squiggly you and

your friends are in this cabin water is

starting to pour into it over the lip of

the doorway and there's just chaos in

the hall outside the water is coming

through so forcefully into the hall that

if you think you were to step out into

the hall you'd be swept away and who's

all in here with me everybody all the

kids okay swilley's about to like

suggest some be like huh and then the

flashback in his memory comes back of

strakes saying if you don't say anything

for the rest of this trip you can call

me Mom yeah oh by the way there is

something in this room that may or may

not interest you oh boy I had mentioned

it previously but in a closet there is

what appears to be a diving suit now it

is sized for somebody much bigger than

you but it looks to be like an airtight

suit with a big sort of Bell helmet I'm

gonna try to whisper

so that jerks can't hear me guys

everyone I have a plan NAT signs I can't

hear you but does signing count is

speaking squiggly goes

good job say okay we're gonna pile into

that suit all three all of us for all

four Oh

I'll be okay I'll navigate no no no I

would be the head but it was my idea but

you you can already see Jenks climbing

through the like that but flap like in

Stallman like half a leg now I just like

looking at the water rushing in she's

like fine fine fine

you're the head whatever yes so Jenks is

one like Simon it okay sounds all right

cool can we squeeze into this thing

we'll find out all right all right

so the kid is that the what all the kids

are basically gonna try to do now is try

to squeeze into this one-man diving

swimming like so if it's for I'm so he

would be a leg leg torso head sorry like

it'll just be like fly I think that

Jenks won't fit in a leg so I think

Jenks will have to be the torso like

yeah you're right

Ferdinand what a bit about her leg

anyway all right so it's Simon NAT then

Jenks torso then squarely on Jenks

theoretically okay

I'll roll for Simon each of you just

roll a d20 this is a group check so half

of you need to succeed it 18 for net got

a nine nine it all kind of falls apart

when you first try it and now you're

lying in the piece and among the pieces

of the diving center you're not able to

pull it off this round

all right as the water starts to barrel

in because none of you decide none of

you actually decided to close the door

soon that not succeeded and she's just

standing there and one of the legs like

I thought the door was closed and now

because wait so because Walton was out

in the hall he was and maybe I misheard

but I thought you'd like generators when

DF left the room what the kids in it he

didn't close the door behind him he left

the door open

ok so then it was not an issue then

though the - the - what I assume we're

airtight doors wasn't that wasn't one of

them

the the door to the cabin is open so all

the water that's flooding into the hall

will eventually flood into the cabin as

well ok

but hey once the kids get in their

diving suit they won't care squeal it's

like I swear this is a good idea

mm-hmm ok palton you had your turn

evylyn uh still more water gushing in

can she can yell down the hallway and

people can hear right yes Strix do you

have that ability to just blink us all

home she can't hear you because she's

underwater and you didn't know that so

you can get no response and I hear that

though yes

can I gosh out back Elin there's too

many of us that's that sucks yeah I

think we can uh okay right it's eight

okay here's here's my plan Chris Perkins

alright ready yeah Evelyn can cast

nature's wrath for spectral vines to

reach up and pull a creature and hold

them okay

can she cast nature's wrath to try to

grab the door and pull it shut while she

pulls on it and the door pulls so

they're all pulling together she could

but since aiding basically just gives

you advantage regardless it doesn't

matter if the second if the spell is

helping you or not the door is already

helping you

hmm so the spell would only give me

advantage then you don't get double

advantage isn't yeah it wouldn't like be

another effect that I was casting cuz

it's like a spell effect right

oh that's peppy okay

Oh does your animate object spell end

Nate when you cast the suggestion

because that's also concentration right

maybe it isn't a suggestion

duration is 24 hours okay then you're

fine

you can still concentrate on the other

spell how does the size of my emoji

shield compare to the size of this hatch

I mean they're not a perfect match but

they're probably I mean your shields not

tiny the hatch is probably about 5 feet

high and about 3 feet wide Yvonne's just

like going through everything she has to

try to figure out something

because if if an 18 didn't get it last

time she doesn't think she's gonna get

it I guess she's just gonna

I guess she's just gonna try again okay

she rolls with advantage well 17 well so

22 all right

not enough again the door the the the

water coming through is too strong too

much force then of course you hear the

kids they all sort of it sounds like

they all fell down at once

[Music]

DF you can see that the the two drow

that are swimming in the water attacking

you in Strix have broken off

clearly and spelled by Paul tunes magic

the wizard is not and continues to be a

threat cool I'm underwater what do you

do man this wizard is an I don't

think he would just attack us with

reckless abandon unless he had his own

escape plan or something so he's

probably ready to teleport out of here

or something stupid like that but also

attacking him just seems like not the

best used to my time well there's far

worse things happening boy oh man

oh yeah I guess I'm just gonna I'm gonna

go and attack that wizard because I got

a if he keeps casting spells and craft

making things worse while the West was

trying to fix the situation those it get

worse okay go ahead you can get up to

him all right

and I'm pretty sure that I'm close

enough so you get like the backstab

bonus right all right no no he's at the

other okay he's at they you're at the

console he's at the other end of the

bridge okay

I know evylyn knows this but how many

how many people can strike support eight

didn't just attack 416 using a gutter 16

yeah on a two minute the the wizard

throws up a field spell to block that ah

yeah and this whole time gift will still

just kind of try attempt to argue just

like you idiot stop we're all gonna

drown wizard says not me

cool okay okay okay

if why are there too many of us there's

only four kids and four in the party in

that I think that's eight how does it

work

just checking trying to close the star

but just you know wanting to make sure I

understand what's going on do you have

any more actions or anything together

you done I don't have any more actions

now all right the wizard will go next he

is going to set he's in a line with you

and Strix he is going to lightning bolt

you both so I need you both to make a

dexterity saving throw neat I know in

third edition

there's like a opportunity attack

against people who spell cast next to

you is that not in fifth edition I don't

know if you make a ranged attack you

have disadvantage when creatures are in

melee with you oh I could yeah I could

counter spell him yeah I could counter

spell him if he's gonna do this I'm

gonna counter spell him okay what level

are you casting the spell I am going to

cast it let's see

fifth level okay you dispel his magic

suck it I say is I alright so his little

lightning bolt fizzles out many curses

yeah okay that's you wash your mouth out

you'd meaning huh Strix what do you do

um okay she counter spells that yeah

look at him and say she's gonna make

sure that you'll go down with us being

scary that's right well we were pirates

and if we'd stayed pirates this wouldn't

have happened

oh here's the it's just like wait so we

are going down so quickly I also say I

can't do word of recall unless we're all

next to each

with invites a fool as we can move we

can be but I okay but if we can get

within five feet I there's eight of us

so we can go we can leave

we have the legs so we can get to evil

and we can leave I'm like saying this

but I'm also looking at that wizard like

I don't want him here so also if someone

pulls a lever that made us go down you

should probably push it the other way

and make there's too many things to do

now I'm panicking it's your turn though

I don't like just I want this wizard to

stop the wizard needs to stop he

promised he clearly thinks but he screws

or you know you can kill the wizard and

we can drown and that'll be a cool way

to go out we have this great advice of

let's leave before we Trek on um okay so

I'm going to go ahead and really quickly

you hear another gnome voice come

through what sounds like a intercom and

I can't help but notice that we're going

down please make us go up you have to

operate the controls at the console to

make the vehicle go up well tell me how

controls are on the bottom that she says

there are two levers on the left hand

side the right lever and the left lever

on the left hand side pull the right

lever on the left hand side okay I hear

this as a voice from the gods above so

that we don't die

or kill ourselves

Thank You gnome god

what's your name like Don told grim

might remember gone there's a name for

them gnome God

I think about this for a second and then

I dive under water and pull the laughs

okay when you try to pull the lever you

can see that it's become jammed it

doesn't move and you can actually see

little sparks coming off of it hmm no

that was just a red herring

okay well I'm back up and I'm like never

mind about time let's go and I'm just

kidding that first time actually first

I'm going to water correct gaseous form

but it act just like water as a surface

which means if you turn someone into a

cloud under water doesn't that mean they

would just float to the surface

yeah probably this is a horrifying idea

like like the little fizzy and a pop

yeah okay so I'm just gonna look over to

Deif and turn him into a cloud know what

you're gonna you can choose not to be

turned into a cloud it's okay if you

want it's voluntary do you the second

time in one day an involuntary polymorph

sorry I'm sorry what what if we all just

death are you and will are you a willing

gas cloud there's a plan it's fine

God within 5 feet as a cloud if it would

make you raise up what I would like

would it still like allowed me to like

give you the cracks or anything of the

submarine or is it so airtight well they

Center he's not terribly airtight right

now but it's fine

he's the actual submarine itself does

not have

that you could slip through as a gasps

okay it's it's fine it's fine if I see

his face in it well it's too horrifying

I won't do it

I'm just gonna be like I'm gonna miss

you step over to evil like just get over

there as fast as we can we're gonna

leave you can't see her because you're

on the lower level I'm gonna run to evil

and very quickly okay all right don't

get hit by the wizard just leave all

right okay so you're gonna head up I'm

gonna head up towards head up towards

evylyn okay on your turn you can climb

the ladder to get up to the flying neck

with paltin that's as close as you can

get and and you and Paul Turner sort of

clinging to the that the chairs on the

flying deck um all right so I get up to

the top

quick and spell a pass wall underneath

the wizard on the ground okay let's see

as quick as I can to dump them into a

hole and then turn it off okay right

when the opening appears any creature

objects a floor within range yeah and it

can be up to 20 feet deep so that's good

it doesn't work both ways

well there's a there's a lower debt so

he's like he would just be dumped into

the lower deck I just wanna get him

praise on a lower deck either into the

bowels of the submarine or into the

ocean yeah both are acceptable all right

all right I'm gonna have him make a

pitch there any saving throw what's your

spell save DC miss tricks 17 okay he is

able to leap out of the way when it

forms

nice guy so he's got a pretty good

dexterity yeah so he gets out of the way

but you have created another hole and

since this vehicle is not pressurized

currently water suddenly erupts out of

the hole engulfing EDF and the wizard

and the rest of the bridge it's okay the

ocean represents all of our sins from

four seasons

this is our Redemption this is how we

are forgiven I thought it was I thought

it was gonna be like in how we are

forgiven this is like that you know that

80s movie the one where they like talk

to the aliens I'm just in underwater and

then the underwater is like pressurized

and there's like a pool these is where

we die the vehicle suddenly hits

something you're not sure what but I

need you all to make dexterity saving

throws also um maybe this jarring if I'm

pulling on the door right when we hit

something would make it go kaboom no but

nice try yep like none of that Patrick

Roth has a here make sense to

me how did y'all do on your dexterity

saving throws 16 16 is good yeah 15 is

good 15 18 all right you're all able to

grab on to something

pillars chairs whatever to keep them

from being thrown and taking any damage

nice and the Dark Elves likewise are

able to brace themselves all three of

them you probably just hear the kids go

WOW tumble tumble tumble and there is a

loud sort of after you hit it you hit it

with such force that it almost stops the

vehicle for a second and then the

vehicle tilts toward the port and you're

all sort of heaved to one side and so

whatever it hit was pretty darn sturdy

as I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure we

just hit the gates to the afterlife

they're not they're not gates it depends

on who you're it's the end is you're

holding on this dead known just sort of

floats past you in the water he's

probably in the land of I don't know

what that gnome got is in gone floating

by is just like we will join you soon my

friend because the ship is listed to one

side one of the windows is now

completely flooded in under water and

actually the part of the flying deck

that you're on palton is mere inches

above the water you know I have to be

serious if I'm saying we don't have time

to talk about religion and then all the

water starts to gush down over your head

paltin that that seems about right

this is this is the Chris Perkins

baptism the two the two Dark Elves that

you have cast suggestion spells on are

still following your instructions you

see that they're going over to the

console one of them is fighting with a

liver

the other one is activating some other

things and you can hear mechanisms in

the vehicle doing things but you're not

exactly sure what they're doing but you

can make a I'll let you make an insight

check if you want

Paul yeah

15 and yeah I'll let you make a check to

didn't say you said yeah right

I don't like talk to them just like

their efforts aren't Darfur not this

will all be in vain

well DF is still trying so I got 19 okay

do you think that they might be trying

to flush the water out of the ship one

of them is hey what is doing this sorry

the two Dark Elves who are trying to

gain control of the console the ones who

have been charmed by paltin one of them

seems to be trying to get the broken

lever to work the other one seems to be

trying to flush the water so we can

actually actually take this thing I'll

just shout there seems to be a build

system and they're trying to do it is

there any way that didn't I just spell

the hole or is the hole still there

that's the hole has not been dispelled

okay so there will still be more water

coming in and plus the door is still

open

despite evils Herculean efforts and

strict stop that can't she closed the

door she can close though the past one I

can't I have to close the pass wall yeah

yeah and she can do that on her next

turn it is that was the drowns turn the

kids can try again

to get into their diving suit everybody

roll D 20s Simon I'll roll for him

Simon's good yeah you got a six sixteen

now rolled a seven this time yeah 18

that does it that's that's enough

successes you're all able to climb into

this suit and which is good because more

more water is coming in you zip it up

tight you make sure the helmet is secure

on your head there squiggly and you can

sort of look out through the circular

window your friends can't see

they're stuck in the depths of the suit

underneath you now do they count as

I got eyes on everything we're fine so

you'll have to kind of direct them to

move forward at this point the legs

which would be NAT and Simon just make

another d20 rule yeah and this is a

group checks only one of us to succeed I

got us three so I even got a five so

they they start to walk and then they

can't stop and they say kept speeding up

and speeding up speeding up and you see

the bulkhead coming but you can't get

them to stop and you just bang your head

right into it and then you all fall

backward and we're still in this

important well and then you get caught

up in the water swell and you slide out

into the hall great oh oh my god do they

slide past even no they go the other way

because the ship is angled down they go

toward the bridge so they come over the

waterfall into the bridge kids are

coming and they fall tossed you into the

bridge water and just start to float

around in this diving suit Oh

according to plan all right and then you

start to just sort of sink to the bottom

window mmm so now you're under the water

on the bridge looking out this big

window into the harbor and you can see

squiggly what looks like a shimmering

reptilian dragon swimming around in the

in the briny depths oh that that's

enough for me guys halten what do you do

when you see the kids and their diving

suit just sort of sink to the bottom of

the bridge

ha they seem okay

or they seemed okay okay is you don't

know how much ever they have I I

definitely know it was them oh you saw

squigglies face briefly as he was having

a good time yeah all right and there was

something malformed about the the shape

the configuration of the suit to suggest

that there were probably four kids

inside it so like Ennis alright cool so

did anyone else see that the kids are

coming there at the bottom I had I don't

think there's much I can do about that

squidly you can also see what appears to

be a shipwreck that maybe you just

collided with oh there be treasure in

there now just to be clear only the kids

can hear each other in the diving suit

nothing they say can be heard outside of

the diving suit that's what I say yep

there be treasure Simon Says

I don't think we should be worried about

the treasure right now okay so now we

need to figure out how to swim so legs

move a lot not can't hear right or see

true she's kind of like default she's

just trying to find peace within herself

and and then jinxes torso yeah hey Jane

sturdy okay now I can't hear so I need

you to just shake that around a lot all

right and then and then Simon you you

did tell with your legs

yeah I guess let's see does not have

she has her necklace with her she just

doesn't have it on does she have room to

like pull it out of her pocket and put

it on or is she helped you could do that

okay

so she'll put it on be like okay what

okay so you need to kick butt but

instead of your leg it's your whole body

that starts flopping this diving suit

sort of starts to kind of flop around

and spin around arms just kind of like

floppy arms I think it's working well

that's going on evylyn the the clockwork

command is going to try to stab you

three more times one is a Miss one is a

hit and one is a Miss so only 1 hit this

round no that's going to deal 13 points

of damage

okay okay is it my turn

oh no it's his turn he just finished so

it's your turn now there's so much

underwater there's so much water in the

passageway you can actually feel some of

the pressure off the door really yeah

and the the clockwork man is mostly

underwater at this point not that he

seems to be bothered by it in any way

evylyn was gonna ditch but if she feels

like there's a chance she'll try it

again

okay the door is still animated uh yeah

almost still with advantage yeah if the

door is still animated could it make

more attempts to close theoretically it

does have its own turn but it really

hasn't got much of a hope at this point

cuz its strength is not very great true

I just need an at 25 priori world it's

miles total mm with advantage mm-hmm

okay

yeah you thought the door was easier but

nope guess not

it's still proving impossible to close

that's unfortunate

Evelyn's like starting to cry with

frustration she's had a very hard day

and she was she was holding it together

and being very professional but this

door

she's like locked in a compelled duel

with this door it's like the doors even

on your side and you and she's like

gotta be planted against like either

side of the like hole and she's just

yanking on she's like why can't it just

be easy robust why can't you just be

nice for him what if you think you're

having a bad day

cut to jarl Axl good on the aft castle

of his ship looking down into the water

at these bubbles coming up and slowly

getting farther away from the ship and

that gives even some small feeling and

all he tells his crew is I think I may

have underestimated them this is going

to be we got him we totally meant to

sink this thing to the bottom of the

ocean all right

and it is now DF turn oh boy there's

still a wizard that who is opposing you

the other drought did not seem to be

opposing you

still pretty upset about this wizard

he's pretty upset about you

I think everyone's pretty upset at this

point how many super super Trixie things

that can do right now so I think it

might just still be trying to fight this

wizard off okay yeah

is it Strix nearby or he never engaged

with strict so this is still just

regular attack yeah all right no she's

now above you

yeah she's I believe on the floating she

climbed up onto the flying deck above

you right yep I'll stay here and I'll

just keep busy because we're gonna need

some magic to get out of here and I

can't do that okay dude whatever you

gonna do 23 he is going to attempt to

use a shield but you breach it yeah

they're all your damage damage okay he

takes that staying where you are just

keeping him checked as it were I think I

think so yeah okay he goes next he is

going to

he casts a darkness spell engulfing the

entire bridge in complete impenetrable

darkness that encompasses D F Strix

paltin the kids the drow counterspell go

ahead

oh actually you don't even have to roll

you automatically succeed eat we're not

thank you thank you all right very good

I like to imagine that was a little like

hand wave like a Jedi eat good thank you

Paul the water is already gonna be dark

enough it yep okay so that's his turn

next is Strix okay yeah I also read the

word of recall it's only five willing

creatures so we all can't leave sorry

so the kids count as one no I'm not I

didn't I'm not going to try and convince

Chris of that I am going to use

telekinesis on that stupid door and

close it okay what about the hole in the

hole oh yeah sorry forgot about the hole

yeah I'm gonna get I gotta spell that

hole first I'm gonna do spell I'm gonna

be like whoops then just fell back or

just can I just like turn it off like

I'm just

I don't know me thank can it lasts for

one hour it's not concentration

concentration Troy I have to just spell

it yeah well that's you have to

disability run spell cool that's fine

I'm a big dummy someone gave me a big

wizard staff that makes me even more

becoming okay do you want to code this

spell it yes please

okay I will just tell my own spell

on the ground okay and then the staff to

do it I will use my staff to do it okay

so you roll this is the waffle karate

okay charisma check adding your charisma

bonus so yeah so that's could dispel it

yep so it's a charisma check so do i

roll and then add my charisma d20 and

add your charisma okay I didn't just

spell my alright while this is going on

by the way water is just starting now

it's completely - absolutely pour over

your strike so people you're crying and

your tears are just being washed away by

a torrent of water falling on top of

your head your your your witch's hat

gets ripped off and starts to float away

[Laughter]

cuz that's just how this session is

going turns out when you're drowning no

one can see you cry true enough the dark

yeah you could do that as a move if you

want to leave the bridge and just jump

back down and swim out to your hat all

right well that's going on one of the

Dark Elves is crawling underneath the

console to try to figure out how to

release this lever while the other ones

tugging on it I'm gonna see if they

succeed working together actually they

do they're able to get the lever down

and you feel the ship start to change

direction thank goodness our enemies are

worthwhile that's the idea it's like

we're not capable but maybe they are

there's enough swishing around here kids

that you are sort of getting kind of

bounced and buffeted around in this suit

you're underwater on the bridge what did

the four of you want to do in your

diving suit apart from the the kicking

and the random flailing

all right yeah I think I think we're on

the right track I think if we carry on

as planned we will eventually see your

jinx go didn't you see the dragon it was

a nice dragon maybe I'll help us I'm not

sure how you would actually know that in

game

didn't you see if you told us I I said I

that was treasure treasure and I also

said never mind I don't know that okay

anyway resume resume flop okay much

flopping is going on do we do we get any

kind of check for the flop what where

would you like to be scribbling not at

the bottom of this up okay so we I saw

most of the party in the hall hazard

yeah okay I want to try and get back up

there okay so you're telling them to

flop up upward all right

everybody can make a check who's inside

even Jenks who's the torso even squidly

20 excellent Simon's helping 15 so the

arms are doing really well great not got

an eight okay so the only one who is not

contributing to the greater success of

the team right now is Annette but the

others are able to to compensate and you

are able to kick up to the surface

quickly so that your head is bobbing

above the water and you can see paltin

just absolutely drenched clinging to a

swivel chair on the flying deck god that

had to have looked so weird and Paulding

there looking back at squiggly through

his eye his porthole squiggly like

squeezes an arm up in front like palms

just uh-huh it's pollens turning all

right cool can I animate object the suit

it is technically it is an object so yes

you would have to cease your

actually since you can do two

medium-sized objects I will let you

animate that in addition to the door

cool

I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna try and

have it it's a ladder up to us right

yeah most of the ladder is submerged but

there's still a little bit above it I

love that the suits like flopping around

in the animates it it's like very very

pleased and so then like the kids inside

just lose all control and they this just

like moving that's a little creepy for

that in control of their own vessel yeah

a team we've been compromised we've been

compromised they got in a hack the

mainframe

now squiggly you would have seen palton

cast a spell you don't you couldn't have

heard him but you would have seen him JK

I'm pretty sure it's cool and what do

you want the suit to do just climb up

onto the flying deck with you pollen

yeah just to get everyone together so we

can run out alright well you and the

kids are now together no way I'm gonna

give the suit a little high-five nice

the suit little high-five you back

evylyn oh my god the man the clockwork

man rolled two natural 20s on you and

missed with his third attack is this

getting actually concerning like I

actually might go down to this so that

will be 26 points of damage on one

attack what is evil and constantly get

like chain crit I'm checking what I have

I think you think keeping track of it

right

okay I'm down then okay

okay so when you fall the water

immediately just washes you down toward

the bridge and paltin as you're

high-fiving the suit of armor you see a

very bloody bleeding evylyn just course

past you and go over and into the the

the big pool of water that's now the

main deck of the ship or the main bridge

of the ship and she's clearly dying and

turns out drowning because she's wearing

armor so she sinks right to the bottom

like turn to the kids like alright kids

today we're gonna learn about what a TPK

is now and squigglies like I mean the

suit can swim it Ken alright so that's

that okay

next up is evylyn you have a death save

that point here we go 18 okay that is

one success you know I also have to read

drowning

I like how this is the episode that

Chris Perkins was extremely excited for

it's not exactly playing out as I

thought it would Thanks dice dice dice

not nice 183 sorry this role comes up so

infrequently okay you are choking

because you are not breathing like us

you are technically breathing but you're

breathing water what is your

constitution modifier six okay you do

not know you're already at zero and

dying oh okay

well okay you take an automatic death

save failure okay okay next is death

cool I have an idea slash plan Strix is

underwater getting our hats no doggy

paddling or doggy paddling so you can

hear you can hear Strix can hear you

and paltin can hear you alright the

positive Dee still have to mention door

yep alright Strix user word of recall

get the kids at evil and out of here huh

palton you and I we're gonna we're

getting out of here and we're gonna swim

for the surface as hard as we can okay

aren't you really far down yeah I could

technically I could technically uh no I

can't

well you need to listen watch but if you

of both you die yep yep yeah we know if

we die yeah really mad we don't have

time for this that's the plan

all right well I will stomp down to the

hills and pick all of you back up if

that happens yep that's what you do and

we will be waiting for you because

you've done secretly bad oh my god plan

point out that even was yelling about

the kids and how they were safe in a

diving suit they are safe in a diving

suit well we don't know how much air

that thing has I'm actually another

mission rules level Chris yeah would an

animated suit be technically a willing

creature and if they were to say we were

recalled we'd be just a suit or it'll be

the suit with everyone inside of it how

weird is that I already have the answer

to that but I'm not necessarily going to

share it with you I'm not talking about

that I'm saying that the suit is walking

around and swimming and has water

tightness so it can't run out of breath

on the way to the surface it's true so

I'm just I'm totally metagaming as

someone who is not there in character to

say that maybe the kid should swim no

I've thought of that but we've well

deism it is your turn

yeah all right they're like isn't a way

to get them out there okay I guess that

gates open huh

there's a hole in the bottom of the

submarine currently oh yeah yeah yeah

I am going to attempt to swim down to

evylyn okay you're back to the surface

okay god that's not it's not great not

easy for you but you are determined and

are able to pull her up to the surface

yeah it's it's like it's like Mouse like

barely yeah but I'm just trying to like

keep her out of drowning yeah that

you're able to do automatically yeah so

with that it's hystrix you could

teleport yourself the kids and even all

out of here paltin you can dimension

door out we can swim up I can have you

moon splinter to miss you step out and

also a big look tide of water goes over

your head the F as you're spelling out

your plan also at dimension door I can

just take you with me also that that's a

plan

yeah do you need to speak to the cast

dimension door it has a verbal component

yeah all right now Ryan's we can't do

that underwater to do a quick underwater

teleport I could do it like out a window

yeah yeah okay but yeah you can if you

can and actually you can do verbal

components underwater it's just at least

get out of the out of the sub into the

water find the direction of the surface

because I don't even know at this point

mm-hm and use that to potentially to

mentioned or both of us further up and

out yep good got it

way ahead of you let's go alright so you

pass it over to get your hat

oh so I get my hat you get your hat

that's not I mean that's fine but that's

fine just be careful there's dangers out

there yep get them out

no okay it's not my turn it is now your

turn all right so we have evylyn the

kids are floating around can I only

grabbed the floaty arm of the suit so

the arm is not floating around anymore

the kids are up on the flying deck

holding on with paltin okay okay

why don't take the kids out of the suit

and

one of you get in the suit I don't know

if we'll have time for that

okay fine all right fine fine everyone's

everyone's fine it's fine the ship by

the way is moving up now hmm should we

just wait it's moving up but still

filling with water

yes yeah no we ain't waiting yeah

there's still dirt there still drowning

right now my next round it will be full

of water all right let's do it

thank them all right but they can just

walk home they're in the suit I point to

the suit okay fine

okay no one no one's okay fine it's not

about reasoning it's about prezi babies

take them we got last word a recall on

the kids

evylyn myself recall is yourself in a

pot I know everything yeah six yeah

myself

evylyn you end up to five yep all right

so you get over now evylyn is not too

far away because deaath is swimming

right next to you with her the kids are

not within 5 feet so you'll have to

bring evylyn over to them Strix okay

I'll just drag her over then okay

DF will pass her off to you you swim

over to the kids the kids can't doesn't

look like they can hear inside that

thing

squiggly doesn't seem to be paying you

any attention right

open the but clapping reaching Armin

yeah I just yeah I'll open the Bott flap

it suddenly fills with you know just

it's a bit of water down there yeah I'm

just like really okay bang everyone out

of the suit but my queen says what what

about Paul Dawson's decided to swim yep

we're good what it's fine I can

deathlord you way to death Ward them all

deaf board them that's four rounds of

spells all right we're leaving

XR rain I just don't say anything to

Simon and I just like grab him and we

leave okay you and Evelyn NAT Jenks and

squidly all appear damn it Simon he

wasn't willing god damn it in your safe

room and then I say I'm swimming I'll be

fine Simon Says beside Simon pops out

through the butt and says

that's let's let's let's leave together

I mean you precious idiot it's all right

Paulding get him out of here you can go

with you through the door right yeah

will can your it is how Paul Tain's turn

okay so you you so you're taking it up

evens gone yeah there that's right

okay sorry myself okay yeah you got a

splinter

alright cool yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna

grab Simon mm and what's what's the

nearest way to like get out the nearest

way to get out is through a hole in the

bottom of the ship that seems to have

been magically made by Strix is spell

okay

would I be able to in my turn grab some

and swim down to that and then once I

get out dimension door straight up you

could do that okay

I'm gonna grab them you're gonna leave

the diving suit I don't have enough time

to get in the diving suit right we're

just we're just gonna swim our way down

I'm right I'm not wrong right I wouldn't

have enough time to get in the suit and

no you don't think you're gonna oh you

get in the suit this round you'd have to

take a couple of rounds to do it so you

grab Simon you swim down to the hole you

get through the hole you are now outside

of the ship in the dark cold water and

you want to dimension door up mm-hmm

just make a let's call it an

intelligence check to see if you know

which way up is wouldn't I just like

float you know it seems easy but it

never is cool

sixteen you're good all right all right

and you can dimension door hundreds of

feet right so yeah I think it's 500 feet

so how high would you like to depend how

far which likes a dimension door is it

like pitch-black out oh yeah it's

actually like really dark there's no way

there's no way if it's that dark it

could be because you can see hundreds of

feet into water

okay we're gonna we're gonna risk the

biskits we're gonna go 500 feet up 500

feet plot-twists rushing water

well there's like I can't be that's

great I love it it's crazy

absolutely diagonally doesn't does it

wouldn't palton have some sense of how

deep this water was well he well no not

really he hasn't spent many time and

deep water Bay certainly not in the bay

this far down in the bay so 500 feet it

is Simon hold you tightly as you Banff

straight up and you are now 400 feet up

in the air how is how can we not one

hundred feet it's this water is just

dark it's murky and not clean it's it's

like dirty dirty water man freakin water

deeps gotta figure out it I'm gonna say

because I agree with Chad on this one

and they're spamming it like crazy

they're saying dimension doors to a

place you can visualize is that true oh

that's true that's actually a good point

because if paltin can visualize the

surface you should be able to go to the

surface yeah all by that because I know

that following 400 feet into water is a

big ol square any place that you can see

one that you can visualize or one that

you can describe by stating distance and

direction so

you can't describe this one by distance

and direction necessarily or by

direction you can but you can visualize

the surface I visualize the surface all

right yes you appear on the surface man

as funny as that other timeline would

have been it's like funny until you fall

and realize that water is solid when you

fall that far

I mean pencil dive yeah you wouldn't

have fallen next is so you're on the

surface you see the eye catcher some

distance away with a bunch of crew

members aboard staring at off in your

general direction and you hear

do you speak elvish perchance I damn

well might and do ok then you hear an

Elvish voice a familiar voice that you

hate basically order crewmembers to

fetch you and you see what looked like

two figures leap off the ship onto

surfboards made of waves oh that's so

cool and next up is evylyn you get a

death save my keen eye stabilizer she's

right here I'll tell your turn I guess

you're not drowning what about the kids

oh yeah you're not drowning anymore so

yeah I still would roll it yes yeah this

is just in case your role in natural one

which would be bad 15 okay uh okay and D

F you're still in the ship right yeah

the mechanical man surfaces out of the

water and attacks you three times

19 how do we forget about it

23 and 25 well I think you're gonna I'm

kind of dodge at least one of these I'm

going to use my blade mastery to go into

from to go into a parry stance to give

myself +1 armor class until the next

turn deflecting the first attack great

I'm done candy dodged the other ones

right okay so the second attack will do

a total of 12 points do you want to is

that the one you're on Kenny dodging

okay the other one does 18 yes oh nine

oh so you take total of 21 yep got it

still alive yes I am alright what do you

do I'm gonna try to swim to that diving

suit okay you can get trapped and then

now if you're going to are you gonna use

a disengage at some point cuz you will

provoke if you start to use an action I

will not disengage I'll take the

provoked okay opportunity detect from

robot man he rolls in 19 on the die so

that's definitely gonna hit you that's

gonna be a total of 14 points of damage

still up though yep you get to the back

- okay so I get to the diving suit mhm

can I use my cunning action fast hands

to attempt to Don the suit yes so I do

that to Don the suit you are now in the

suit completely zip cool and then I'll

take moon splinter and use that to try

to Missy step out of the ship into the

water you can see through the window on

the bridge so you can really see a place

on the outside of the bridge that you

can get to and that's exactly what you

do you appear in the water in the suit

floating there

and it's weird and yeah and the and

because the submarine is still kind of

moving on a kind of lazy upward

trajectory you immediately start to pull

away from it

great yeah minimal starts women for the

surface okay well it turns out this

thing is more like a walking on the

ground kind of like walking on the

bottom of the ocean kind of suit it's

not the most dexterous so you're like

flailing your big yeah it's hard weird

exactly you're trying to get up and

you're having a lot of trouble getting

up I need you to make a strength check

okay well I'm not drowning no you're not

so there's that and actually the air in

here even though the kids have been

sucking on it for a while seems fresh

good like maybe there's some kind of

magic to the suit that replenishes its

air supply oh that's good that was

afraid of to have to suck down a bunch

of kid here well you know one of them

did pee we probably burp or and oh yeah

strength check yeah I just a flat 15

okay yeah you're able to make your way

up slowly and then there is a big

creature that comes up underneath you

d/f you sort of sense its presence

momentarily before it sort of comes upon

you in these big metallic wings start to

envelop you and it it tries to grab you

with a claw oh okay all right

it it it hauls you up to the surface

and right as it breaks the surface lets

you go yes so you can it just helps you

get up to the the top of the water and

then it sort of leaps up into the air

and then dives back into the water again

did you maybe go break a submarine

paltin Simon you see DF a little

distance away sort of floating on the

surface near you there they're sending

sending surfers to get us some booths

yeah you know more worries you gotta

keep getting out of here yeah well what

are you oh yeah you can proof okay cool

all right what do you want to do next

paltin do I see it sure that isn't the

the ship yeah it's some distance away

but actually that it's closer away from

the city toward where you had your beach

party the the beach with the retaining

wall on the other side of the bay is

closer and that's like kind of and and

you said that's like away from the ship

yeah okay how far is that hmm like a

couple dimension doors away what an

interesting way to describe said

distance well then I will use one of

said dimension doors toward there BAM

all right did how like how fast were

those were that were they like coming

after it was like they're they have they

have a speed of 60 on these things oh so

it's not like Oh loud they come and it's

like I can I can get away yeah pretty

easy yeah so yes but by you just sort of

jumping magically you're more than able

to keep your distance away DF you're

sort of floundering around in this suit

you see these two humanoids coming at

you on these wave surfboards yeah what

do you do well would I be able to really

quick as a bonus action like whistle a

little tune for DF to help him in

whatever he's about to do you can't hear

you what if I like just sing really loud

benefit from okay so I'm gonna start

swimming towards the coast well using

the misty step dagger to kinda like

assists ya try to get a little bit and

that lets you misty step is 30 feet

right yeah

okay so you can swim about 15 and then

you can go another 30 it's 4:45 and then

you can - for another 15 so about 60

total yeah they're with their move of 60

they're going 120 all out so they're

gonna catch up to you but as you look

back you see as they're coming toward

you this dragonwing come up out of the

water like a shark's fin and just slam

into them both and use it basically just

bitch-slapped them both into the water

alright alright just sort of disappears

under the waves again a slap soap Alton

you're on you're on the sandy beach

sitting there with Simon Wendy a this

sort of comes waiting I put the water in

this ridiculous suit can we go yeah I'm

sorry about your chair it's fine

it's all fine all right everything's

fine let's go home all right

Strix you can tend to evil in to get her

back to consciousness no problem there

while you're doing that you realize

you're still down one albear Oh

goddammit and that's where we'll stop

[Laughter]

you guys can stop for on the way back

through the harbor it'll be fine

pick up waffles on your way home okay

nothing actually got more sudden

suspicions that perhaps this dragon has

a certain vendetta against a dural axel

swimming around his oceans causing yeah

call it causing a bit of a ruckus yeah

he will well we ruined his nice thing so

oops we sunk your submarine sorry you

also ruined in his room which I'm sure

made him even more mad yes he hasn't

found out about that yet alright oops

did my official search ruin all of the

lovely things that you had so we'll be

back next week with an all-new episode

of dice camera action

what'll happen who knows but until then

does anybody have any announcements they

want to share y'all just coming back

from shows and whatnot so yeah i'm i

need to entomb myself in my bed

we talked about I was gonna say I'm

excited to announce that for the next

month I'm not doing I think the

next like waffle crew event is the

descent we're gonna be at the descent

which you all probably saw the

announcement for and I am happy to be

hosting and we'll be there what's up

thank you for doing that

oh yeah my pleasure so look first there

in mid-may about a month from now after

this

yeah this is gonna be doing other stuff

that's not announced yet but I'm very

excited so keep an eye out for that read

it there's still a lot of cool stuff

going on there especially in Kaikohe has

been doing a lot of really really good

comics especially from the episode oh my

gosh yeah at Bolton so be sure to go on

by is that subreddit check it out it

just recently hit seven thousand

followers on that subreddit which is a

lot and I think that's super cool so be

sure to join everyone cool I have to say

that did not play out at all how I

expected and it so I didn't expect

either I I thought I didn't think the

door would be that big of an

insurmountable problem I thought my band

is by the end of the episode I fully

expected you guys to have your own

submarine I it's still there it's still

there I just like I like salad write

something nice and we messed it up so

fast it up yeah I shut the door and if

the robot hadn't stabbed me that last

time I probably could have shut the door

yeah cuz the DC would drop to 20 by then

mm-hmm I'm also it has a build system

and I could shut the door now that it's

all completely actually if Strix hadn't

caused the double flooding they probably

would have been able to pump it out as

fast as it was coming in but they

couldn't I didn't realize that I would

have to dispel my own spell just gonna

turn it off and just be like oh it's off

nope because a fixed duration it has to

be dispelled right it makes sense though

it makes sense first Rix's character

that she has the super-powerful staff

with these spells that she doesn't know

how to use right and it's just doing

left and right and it's just like oh I

don't know what wait what whoops the

cautionary tale just like opening

opening this hole or water floods in and

we're just like all right now close it I

don't I don't know my hat's floating

away

all right well that's it for this week

folks thanks for tuning in and until we

return take care of yourselves and take

care of each other and we'll see you

next week
