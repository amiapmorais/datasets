everybody to dice camera action a D&D

show where too much fun they shed tears

and hit points yes and feelings and

feelings I'm Chris Burke as your DM but

Before we jump into today's game I have

I I want Holly to talk a little bit

about a super special thing happening

right now

yay so uh as you all know well maybe you

don't know now you're gonna learn that

Strix is going to be in the game

Idol champions of the Forgotten Realms

gray and it's super super exciting

because she's got a bunch of super cool

abilities all like stuff from the game

and like I oh my god like I worked with

them on getting her just like perfect

and they did such a good job I can't

tell you how excited I am so I'm gonna

read all the little things I'm supposed

to say Sirk's will be a character in

Idol champions right to unlock Strix

you'll need to play a game on PC in a

new event that starts next week you can

play Strix until then sign up for the

official ill champions newsletter IO

Champions Cup just stay updated and I

have to tell you it's it's gonna be

great like she she cries she throws

things max its she's gonna be the most

suboptimal champion that you can't live

without array excellent thank you oh hey

that's very exciting

all right fertilized in your souls yep

all right now let's time time to cry

yeah before we cry Before we jump into

things I thought it would be actually a

good occasion for us just to talk a

little bit about things that our

characters can do things that our

characters have on their person kind of

as a reminder to you guys of all the

cool things that your character might

possess or can do but also as a reminder

to the fans of all the different things

that your characters are capable of

because it's very easy as we play over

the years over the months and years to

forget about things that our characters

have and this would be a good we're

getting so called out right now

that we have evil things he's given us

just well yeah I didn't study I didn't

do my homework well in the case of

paltin we know he doesn't have his hand

anymore he doesn't house anymore but he

has his mandolin hmm and you know all

the fun things that the kenneth mandolin

can do mate yes I do mind the fans I I I

definitely have it memorized and I'm not

going through my email because that's

where you can use it to cast the fly

spell the invisibility spell levitate

and protection from evil and good on top

of that you can also cure wounds with

the new mandolin you can dispel magic

and you can cast protection from energy

against lightning everyone knows that

very easy good bill remind us yep any

other cool stuff that pom says yes you

did he has super magical light blade and

he doesn't have the ring of winter um

that was recently lost that made me sad

yeah I also have bagpipes flavor yep

totally flavor I have theirs he's been

doing a lot of stuff that he doesn't do

in a long time it's been a complicated

few weeks what are what are some of them

what are some of the things that some of

the other characters have yeah he does

oh yeah I use that once it worked I'm

like all right just ended on a high note

yep he's also got a disguise kit and two

costumes that we don't know what those

costumes are of one could be I don't

know a gorilla costume and the other

could be a party clown for all I know

yeah it's true yeah and if and when it

becomes necessary you can decide what

those are you don't have to settle on

them now you know you can just suddenly

say hey Chris I have a pterodactyl

costume oh I'd like to put it on now

hold on other one be a Chris Perkins

cause there's no such person in this

campaign in the same cinematic universe

as the acquisition think and I saw Chris

Perkins in that game it's true did you

really though oh man

yeah it's not metagaming all right Anna

tell us a little about evylyn and her

cool things well she has a broken axe

called light fall in shards actually no

she doesn't has it yeah yeah um she has

a magical axe called tree bane and she

also has a flaming sword that she has

dubbed the heart of Spinelli which

actually has another name but she

doesn't remember it um she has the holy

symbol of Raven kind which does some

stuff to vampires oh yes which I have

written down but it's like it can hold

them and it can also something do

something to a vampire spawn I don't

know maybe hold vampires basically is

the main thing yeah um she's also a

construct

so she's immune to disease and elemental

things like cold or poison she has she

received like a boon from Lysander and I

I have fluff interpreted that as there's

like a holy oil that kind of runs

through her construct veins that gives

her extra Constitution and she has all

sorts of auras because she's a paladin

and she has a little mouse pet that is

basically just napping and being fat all

the time right

which we assume is being fed regularly

to but we don't often talk about it No

she's nesting inside evylyn chest cavity

somewhere she probably just gets hungry

gets let in districts as robes there's

probably a little pet there's probably a

little pedal and evilest um ik which you

can just press and a piece of cheese

pops out uh-huh she's always like

restocking like one of those bear cages

on lost lost reference Christmas yeah

all right DF yes

what's on you well he has a short sword

a Baxter being called gutter which he

can also place mr kukiz and do to summon

shemekka Arcana law from the city of

signal for terrible things and to regret

every time he also has caltrops I'll

rope what else does he have here know

him what can he do he does have seeds

gloves of thievery which assists in his

picking of locks he also has the horn of

blasting right now yeah and then as very

evident born a future exploding yeah and

as evident by both physically and

metaphorically

he will never fly and I do also I also

did obtain a padlock way long ago in

burrow via which I never used out of

pure fear speaking of never used

evylyn you've got a four leaf clover

pressed between the pages I'd of a book

of manners and etiquette don't you I

gave that districts matrix chopped it up

but just no actual luck I forgot I also

have five candles okay I have manacles

by the way those candles will say

they're like one day oh wow no I feel

like they sorry you know it has manacles

the hell ruin force bomb with the keys

stuck in it that's probably I am

currently down to including key in the

bomb

not including kina bond I have three

keys left and Strix as well

evylyn also has a ton of weapons that

she just carries around javelins and

miscellaneous she has only two javelins

left she also has a short sword a hand

crossbow and oh no the great sword is

hard yeah that's it I guess Strix you've

got a very you got too many things we

could spend the whole show naming all

the crazy crap that you have but let's

hit the highlights okay so you want the

magical stuff whatever okay yeah I got a

lot of stuff empty the robes yeah

there's first before most you got your

staff that can become a great many

things the staff can become a a bunch of

different things I can tell you guys

what it can become really quick just so

of all that you have an Al bear and a

little puppet man yeah and what will

happen to the Triceratops

he used to with dragon bait oh that's

right God thank God yeah with dragon

bait and we've been in here for a month

cheer - dragon bait so good babysitter

it's fine yeah hmm all right

previously in dice camera action the

adventurers the waffle crew reunited

when the ring of winter disappeared

restoring paltin to his senses and

bringing the family back together

the characters then boarded the shadow

Kai's old wagon which was pulled by an

ogre zombie named meat hook and

proceeded to head overland to toward

death Strix was basically assuring the

zombie toward a place where she thought

there might be a shadow crossing back

into the real world the shadow crossings

are known to crop up in battlefields and

place where many many people have died

or are buried as in graveyards meathook

led the waffle crew over a cliff

plummeting to its death and nearly

taking evil and with it but her

fortitude yep she she had enough hit

points to survive the 100-foot fall off

the cliff everybody else was able to

bail out of the coach before it went

over and the waffle crew discovered that

this beach

that there on the edge of the sea is

littered with shipwrecks and the bones

of thousands of dead and the cliffs are

sort of a bone white color it was around

that time when out of the air came the

Raven Queen in her various

manifestations and she took back the

skull chalice and the severed hand aka

hand drew back with her but in exchange

for taking these things back in telling

paltin that his fate had been stolen

from him

she left the waffle crew with a parting

gift and as you all gazed and looked

upon Simon you see that he sort of had a

Rankin and bass style claymation

stop-motion mouth where his old hinged

mouth used to be he's still a puppet but

now he's got an animated mouth that

makes me more upset there was some

confusion online about whether he's

actually a boy or he stole a puppet he's

actually still a puppet but he's got a

real-life mouth mouth two guys and she's

not a real girl yeah just so you know

and everything is terrible and he says

oh well I can talk I have a moist oh my

stars

I can tell jokes and he starts to dance

and parade around on the edge of the

cliff oh I've got a voice like wait a

minute Big Bird stole my darts oh no oh

it's okay success starts like

[Applause]

hyperventilates okay ID Strix everything

will be fine aunt and Auntie all right

that's really what it's a name what do

you call everyone else Simon

oka the earth now Papa Paul did mama

Evelyn couples I got a good one

why was strix late for the waffle crew

family reunion boom over swept what does

a clock do when it's hungry

it goes back for seconds get it goes

back over seconds we should have killed

him how do you make a cloud price family

despite having the first temporary

they're going this isn't real what did

the shoe say to the pants sub britches

rate at palton and she goes this is your

problem

walks away no way you go here at these

tricks

how did why did the Scarecrow get a

prize quickly she's running spacing

after you

no really why did the skirt will get a

prize cuz it was outstanding in its

field so they're chasing each other

around now Talton just sees this he's

like alright so what's next

a puppet I'll never get tired alright

that's good to keep in mind

so where to yes where we still need to

leave waffle starts chasing Simon who's

chasing after Strix oh when he says

strict she'll stop yes dad did you sense

anything about a portal or any way out

of here isn't there supposed to be

something nearby yes you sent something

directly kind of sort of below you in

there's a cave or something yeah yeah

why don't we send chuckles down there to

go check it I have so much to ask him

can't we just sit down and talk for

awhile

I wouldn't know everything about how he

feels and what he thinks I I'm going I

would love to hear it I'm gonna ask him

Simon I'm gonna ask you one question

what is it papa Paulding are you ready

to go yes all right cool all I needed to

know where are we going guys yeah we

should go towards wherever this sense

thing is also I want Strix to make sure

that deaath has the ring so he doesn't

lose any more hitpoints oh right I think

you mentioned that last week yeah yeah

so yeah coughs up a little bit yeah I

think like 24 or something yeah give him

a blanket and the rig and be like hey

stop dying that's right he's got the

blanket around that's right yes thank

you

yeah yeah looks like packs it

occasionally like please stop oh yeah so

I guess we'll go hey mama

evylyn yeah yes yes you can call me that

you know where winter palton keeps his

gold winter papa

I I can't say I do in snow banks

snow banks you're such a funny little

child thank you I just eat right she

tries to pinch his cheeks but she hands

oh yeah it's like she's like this is

gonna be so fun let's just chitchat the

whole time we go where we go let's go

okay so many jokes to tell now you see

Strix just like tank go into our robes

and take like to like mothballs just

shove it just like smash them in there

and she's just like everything's better

yeah

now you just hear all right as you make

your way around the cliffs and you're

flying to get a better view it is very

foggy here but through gaps in the fog

you can see that from the rocky shore

the pebbled Shore there is a staircase

that was looks like it was carved long

long long time ago it's all eroded and

worn that sort of goes up the cliff face

to what appears to be a hole about 30

feet 70 feet from the top of the cliff

and about 30 feet from the shore and it

looks like a tunnel at first glance and

if you don't fly you would have to scale

the cliffs down 70 feet to reach this

tunnel that's how precarious our Sun

cliffs they are they're sort of like

it's white limestone with lots of hand

holds but sometimes the hand holds are

spaced oddly apart or far away so it's

still a sheer treacherous drop you could

do it without climbing gear it would

just require a strength athletics check

strikes can polymorph d if again have

you talked about polymorpha came into

some sort of eagle I believe yeah yeah

okay oh yeah that's right then the Raven

Queen showed up right yeah okay so

you're gonna use another polymorph spell

to turn him back

to a bird so the DF can fly down to the

tunnel with the rest of you or how does

that solve the waffles Simon

I would also like to request I'd not be

the first person who goes into a spooky

cave if you think caught more blood

would uh would Simon not be able to ride

with me on the mandolin yeah your

meddlin your flies bol only works on a

single creature so no the two of them

good cause the Mendelian just to sit

there and go can I carry him um

technically let me check the winged

boots description

could you use levitate to float him down

you could I'll be job we should levitate

waffles we shouldn't levitates lemon

yeah two of us could probably carry

Simon but but waffles we can't carry

okay yes you of my character sheet and

items I also realize I have 50 feet of

hempen rope if we need to lower him down

you're strong enough I can just

dimension doram down that's all yes

all right and actually you could do you

could do both waffles and Simon because

two creatures can go through a dimension

door right oh no it's you plus one

creature never mind all right I think I

also have to mention oh yeah I have to

mention door too

so I can take so you're both gonna use a

dimension door to send to your

companions down got it yes all right so

you all are now standing in front of

this tunnel which is 30 feet above the

water level set carved into the white

limestone rock and you can see that the

tunnel is vaguely hexagonal if you took

a just a perfect hexagon and you sort of

stretched it vertically that's sort of

the shape that the tunnel meso kind of

boughs and out in the walls and it goes

back Strix with your dark vision you see

it goes into the rock about 60 feet and

then hits an intersection and this

tunnel is about ten feet wide

all right you can also see that there

are carvings in the rock and they look

quite old

in that night in the tunnel walls I mean

I would like to religion check those

okay go ahead and make a check that's 12

okay I would like to religion check like

I was trying to show you up okay go

ahead sixteen all right so with your

roll evylyn and looking peering in to

the tunnel you can see that the bottom

parts of the walls are the sorry the top

angled parts of the walls seem to be

like a procession of robed figures

making their way inward and it looks

like some sort of priestly procession

they're carrying candlesticks and other

things in these images and then you can

see the lower half of the wall which

sort of has a more pebbled texture to it

has a similar procession but they're all

skeletons and these two processions are

making their way inward and the

religious significance you read by

looking at the various other iconography

and things is that this is or was the

lair of some sort of death cult oh oh

it's no big deal it's just people who

wanted to die together yay I really

don't want to fight musti's right now I

really hate anything well don't you

think the portals in here isn't that why

we're going in here yeah you sense

anything Strix can't I sense anything no

I think it's fine we're all here

together Simon can talk he can come up

cheerful with lots of little jokes why

don't we send paulsen in invisible first

uh-huh you can become invisible

go and check for us how do I know

something can't sense me I'll go with

you okay all I'm saying is that DF and I

are not really in the shape to fight

anything is what I yes that's fair

Diaz takes his blanket and just kind of

Simon Says I don't know if we should go

in there it looks pretty dangerous what

do you know that's real nice of you to

be concerned about your family Simon

will be okay

so I was like a king's quest NPC so a

weird sensation overcomes you paltin as

you gaze down the tunnel there's almost

like there's knowledge it almost seems

to distort a little bit in front of you

and then you hear or now you don't hear

it you just sort of sense the presence

of the ring of winter like it's been

brought here oh

okay I'm gonna so as soon as he feels

that he's just like paulten gives like a

you got like flashback face he just kind

of alright sounds good and he just goes

invisible and starts going in okay now

since you don't have a light source what

are you going to use to see once you get

deeper in the tunnel evil and shining

personality well as discussed earlier I

do have five candles yes and if you hold

an invisible candle wallets lit no one

can see the candle always see is the

light emanating off of it yeah cool see

you just like this moving sphere of

light making its way down the passageway

see this was not all for naught the

candle get away that was the whole point

yes I also have just discovered I have a

lantern and now I have four candles yes

and I lit one so the rest of you are

standing back just watching as this

light goes down the tunnel and as it

does you can see it lights up more of

the walls and everything is very very

old and dusty in here and damp and you

can see paltin that there's like salt

crunching under your feet where it's

come off the the sea and just sort of

settled in here make a perception check

as you advance

18 very good three cool you can see that

with an eighteen two things one

underneath the salt and dirt on the

floor

it looks like the floor is covered with

tiles many of them are just slate gray

but there are actually what looked like

what looked like to be colored tiles

that form paths down the corridor and

you haven't been following them so far

you've just started to notice them as

the salt begins to peter out that there

are colored paths that wind across the

floor almost like snakes and they're

made out of gold colored tiles so

there's like a golden snaky path

there's a red snaky path and there is a

purple snaky path and they sort of

overlap and crisscross their way down

the tunnel you also notice about ten

feet ahead now there is a gash in the

roof of the tunnel it looks like some

tremor or something must have caused the

the earth to separate creating a fissure

across the roof sort of a deeper darker

opening where the worked stone has split

and created a gash a deep gash in the

roof ahead the tunnel goes past that

okay do these these pads on the floor

seem like like do they look like they're

just aesthetic like they're just design

or does it seem like there's it might be

linked up to something if it's a design

it's an interesting one the the paths

seem to sort of go their own way down

the passageway you would venture to

guess that they do have a purpose maybe

one or the other is meant to be followed

you're not sure

huh did we hear paltin go huh

oh yeah like guys there's like snaky

paths and I don't know which one to do

and I'm scared

snakes what I hate snakes

you know me how far ahead did Pulteney

Kneedler oh how closely paltin did you

expect to be evilly how me yeah are you

staying back with the others are you

following him no I was with him okay so

as you look around and paltin notes the

paths on the floor the gold snaky paths

the red sneaky paths in the purple snaky

paths you can make a religion check to

see if there's a religious significance

I guess and there and the rest of you

were about like 20 feet behind them

waiting at the entrance oh wow so you

barely went in yeah yeah go huh like I

can and there's no monsters like I'll

shuffle in and just like I sure do you

and is blanket just like a religion 12

okay you're not sure if they have any

brothers a significance at all and you

can hear your friends shuffling in

behind you I can do a religion check to

let's see if I can nope nope I don't

know why was this ami fired from its job

why he's upset right now I'm trying to

take his mind off this why he wanted to

raise get it Ruiz may have that magic or

religion need not know what these pal

details are made up perhaps someone who

is a dungeon delver could figure oh so

DF will shoulder himself to the front of

the

I just and then the brilliant light of

paltin scandal gaze down the climate is

telling his joke to you just declares

this to like to draw him out and then

goes forward yeah some snacks to like

good job little guy huh so I guess

within the tiles itself I'm looking for

anything that seems to show if perhaps

one of these was used more often than

others or if anything could potentially

be dangerous or lead to traps or

whatever okay so I guess just and it's

investigating it precepting him yep

which one would you say let's make it a

perception perception great sixteen okay

you believe studying these that the

golden trail is has been used over time

more than the red or the purple trail it

definitely shows signs of more scuffing

more of the little tiles that make it up

having chipped away from having been

stepped on and crunched underfoot more

often than the others the red trail is

almost with the exception of the

elements that have taken hold probably

the least traveled of the three if

travels at all huh

it's how its tiles are fairly intact if

not completely so I really this

information to everybody even you like

that I was sold if this has been a way

in and out of whatever this cursed realm

if people are going in and out

frequently perhaps the gold trail might

lead us to wherever however we just need

to get out of here now before we do that

maybe let's consider that that one is

the most traveled because that was the

most common guess

all right fair just to throw a wrench in

our logic really quick can I use divine

sense to see if any of the past seems

evil to me or if any like and place

certainly let me just check something

can I lick them all and see if one of

them tastes different

mmm so until the end of our next turn

evylyn you know the location I'm a

celestial fiend or Undead within 60 feet

of you uh you know the type blah blah

blah you're not picking up anything even

districts you start licking the tiles

they taste different

they taste salty any paths we take

together will be the rat one all right

let's definitely not the case oh we

should all stick together what a good

boy Thank You Simon let us never be

separated again that's for voting so do

we still want to go gold or joy itself

shuffle away even when you walk first

cuz you're less you're not a mess okay

watch out anyone who's evil now take you

down we're coming on the gold path right

now alright unless that's wrong so evil

and you don't have dark vision so you

can't get too far ahead of your

sputtering candle flame oh I'll make my

staff the lantern behind her all right

so you've got a flaming sword now we've

got the green light of Strix is Lantern

and we've got Paul tunes little candle

burning in this passageway alright yeah

evylyn and you start to hit four with

your burning sword using it to sort of

light to the Golden Path is that what

you're trying to follow that path yeah

it looks super cool like a like cool

warrior torch alright

evylyn is leading death is literally

like one step behind her just on high

alert

okay cueing his

hunter thing you come to the point

behind me if anything comes yeah oh I am

you come to the point in this ten-foot

wide hallway evylyn that the gash in the

ceiling is almost above you and you can

see little bits of earth have fallen

from it

oh and sort of piled up onto the floor

to the point where you can't see any of

the paths anymore

they're all covered with the debris it's

a mess in here

this is just unacceptable how much dirt

is it like could I weep it away at all

it would take a it would take a few

minutes but you can basically brush or

push it aside if you want to I can also

use my prestidigitation tune it would

take you take you probably a few whiffs

like quite a bit of prestidigitation to

get it all out of the way but you could

essentially the the thing is is you can

kind of push it here and push it there

to clear the path there's if you just

push it further down the tunnel that's

not gonna help cuz just gonna bury oh

yes you do with my broom yes you can I

mean so do you want it you want to go up

there and start sweeping all right

everybody make perception checks or 26-7

okay DF you are the only one who is I

have to roll for Simon so I was like

watch out yeah if you are not surprised

when tentacles descend from the gash in

the ceiling and attempt to wrap around

Strix and her broom everybody everybody

can roll initiative DF you're gonna get

to go in the initial round I got a dirty

20 I got six this guy sucks it's going

back in the bag

alright so dirty 24 Strix six from evil

in death my initiatives 1010 and palton

yeah that's not one oh okay

so the first thing to ask is the

creature and it will make dua dragon act

before no it surprised you're neither

you nor it or surprise so you to that

are acting and it gets higher than you

cool so it attempts to wrap a tentacle a

Barbet tentacle around Strix and rolls a

twenty total on the attack role would

that count as an attack where I could

use it a hellish review you could but

you are surprised so you can't use

reactions then I pedal myself yes

alright so as this tentacle this Barbet

tentacle wraps around you it pulls you

off your feet and up into the gash you

take eight points of bludgeoning damage

as it tightens around you and constricts

you and you are currently grappled by it

and as you are pulled up inside this

gash you can see that it looks like just

this brown milky mass stuck to the roof

of this gash with all these tentacles

coming out of its body and at the front

of its brown mass you see a almost like

a spiders mouth looking back and it's

it's big it's about the size of a like a

lion or a tiger or something plus

tentacles but clearly a total aberration

it doesn't belong in this world or any

other

and then it will use another tentacle to

try to snatch up evylyn and rolls a not

a natural 20 but a dirty 20 on its okay

you two are wrapped up in a tentacle and

you take 14 bludgeoning damage as you

are pulled up into the hole so palton

and DF you see da tha's sorry Strix and

evylyn just off their feet and pulled up

in the hole and in a flurry of tentacles

and then finally the creature is going

to make a bite attack

against Strix strictly now within 5 feet

of Strix in the center you are she gets

its disadvantage ok the creature okay in

that case since I forgot about that it's

actually gonna attack you instead evylyn

great its it'll go for the most

tantalizing target and you're putting

out the aura so there you go no I'm

putting out the aura

you said you blow people senseless and

ER

yeah consents the tasty tasty let the

ender goodness so because you are

grappled it has advantage on its bite

and it's going to roll a 17 on the bite

my armor class is 17 then that is a hit

great oh that was not a lot of dice I

just emptying my door just ending the

dice bag you take 29 points of damage

from the bite oh okay I'm actually

getting the point where I have to add

you that I am going to die I'm gonna die

alright so you hear the crunching of

teeth against metal up in that dark hole

this was a bad idea

polymer comin we have no time for I told

you so's

I'm sorry and next up is DF how high up

is Strix she is right now about 10 feet

off the floor up in the hole okay I

would like to use my movement action so

basically as soon as she's like like

grabbed and thrown up oh yeah DF tosses

off the blanket runs to one of the

cavern walls yeah runs up it and like

springs off of it towards tricks and as

he's like leaping off it's like attack

from the sheath of gutter at the

tentacle that's currently grabbed her

great yeah since this since the holes

are sort of bowed the way they are you

have no trouble using the wall as a

launching pad for your attack go ahead

and remember because Strix is an ally

you have an advantage

your attack role great because I would

also like to use my feat of human

determination to give myself advantage

honest attack role okay

Alton sees all this like ah yeah all

right

many nice okay so yeah don't think he's

gonna kill it but you know alright let's

take a lot of math so in one second it's

double on the sneak attack damage isn't

it is that correct yes correct

Chris Perkins says disappointed don't

sound so excited I like to imagine the

moment where he throws off the blanket

just being super oh oh my god that's the

highest I've ever rolled okay 58 holy

holy Sh yeah yeah - this thing and as a

after taking such a monumental amount of

damage as a reflex its tentacle just

sort of fling missus tricks out and

Strix you sort of land on the floor

she's just like she's a staring like did

that just happen and then did like three

points superhero lands for Nexus tricks

alright was like hero landing as a

legendary action at the end of DS turn

the creature and evylyn teleport away

not be dealing with right now

michaei it's basically of a single

action they can use generally once per

combat Klaus has them so evylyn you find

yourself transported into a sort of

rough hewn rocky chimney with the

creature still coiled around you but

your friends sound much farther away the

rest of you see the creature and evil

and disappear and then from somewhere

even higher up than they were before you

can hear evil ends gasps of surprise and

the creatures gnashing teeth so it just

went straight up it look it sounds like

it disappeared and is now much higher

than it used to be that gash must go up

quite far oh okay so it's so like within

the same poly more or less it's it's not

in the hallway it is now in the chimney

and it was hiding in great alright okay

and that was at the end of DFS action so

now we're back at regular initiative and

Strix you're the first one to go alright

well I already have my broom ready yes

but is it far

fireball probably will reach it honestly

true but you can't you can't see evil

and to shape it around her damn it oh

that's the worst

all right then I will so misty step is a

bonus action correct so I'm gonna I

don't have that many okay she'll just

like look at Diaa to be like thanks for

saving me but I'm gonna go save evil it

now hahahaha just get on her broom

after where she thinks that just enough

to where like like she can see evil in

like to where the creature used to be

I have my flaming sword so it's a good

beacon yeah when you go up 30 feet into

the chimney just make a dexterity saving

throw for me okay you Scrabble to find

purchase I'm on my broom oh that's right

you're sat on your broom but you had to

actually use a action to activate the

broom right no I had X I was sweeping

okay all right so yes you're up on your

broom in the chimney and and 30 feet

above you you see the flickering orange

light of what must be the sort of

Spinelli okay perfect

and then I will cast a I like to cast

fireball okay at fifth level okay wrap

it around evylyn so that she doesn't get

hurt

all right thank you I don't know find

out yeah so evil in a fireball detonates

all around you and fills this chimney

with flame you hear the creature scream

come on Strix and he's gonna make a

saving through I'm actually gonna give

him a penalty on a save cuz he's in a

tight confined space 52 yes Dan you too

alright

yeah so the creature is badly badly

scorched evil and you see all of its

flesh start to burn away many of its

tentacles become sort of blackened

shriveled husks as it screams it still

seems to be thrashing and alive Strix

there is a whooshing sound and then this

green fire comes pouring down the

chimney over you make a dexterity saving

throw with disadvantage since you didn't

dome it yourself from the blast that's a

six okay so you take half damage of that

oh it doesn't matter I'm are I'm too I'm

done I just fall out okay and the blast

continues down spills out to the ground

and fills the tunnel below

d/f halten and simon also have to make

dexterity saving throws I just killed us

all it's too far away

waffles is right at the end of the blast

a dirty point okay so you're gonna take

half damage 22 so and you're gonna take

you have a vision I have a vision so I'm

going to take zero and paltin you take

26 points of fire damage sick with with

my evasion can I use my reaction to

catch strix his falling body yeah you

see this black sort of tumbling mass

come down the chimney

clattering with the the broom and just

make a dexterity acrobatics check okay I

actually know this should actually be a

strength check because you are this is

just dead weight falling on top of you

flat fifteen okay you're good okay you

do manage to catch her after taking no

damage from her blast oh I forgot to

make a saving throw for Simon does he

have any jokes about dying oh dear God

okay hmm yeah yes Simon's like and then

the blast comes down engulfing you

engulfing him and as you turn and look

at Simon he's just like this blackened

charred wooden figure that just ignites

with flight flame and falls down burning

laughing that's that's a panic laughs oh

that was that restricts his turn at the

end of strix astern the Bahama tha's

going to use another legendary action to

make a bite attack on evylyn y'all told

me it was only one for bow it's gonna

hit you it's like three points and like

it has like a regeneration system you'll

learn about it as a DM to worry about I

love learning about D and D D fu or

sorry evylyn you take another 28 points

of piercing damage I need to check how

many 28 28

no there was always the runaway option I

have unconscious oh okay so you two will

fall no you're in the grip of the

creature never mind

so it still got you I don't think you

guys have ever seen construct evil and

unconscious before no so she just is

like a limp robot rag doll alright

thanks Tim not good yeah so what what

the rest of you cleaning out death why I

would like you to make the pay dexterity

saving throw okay got it buddy

16 okay you here t-take tong ting tong

tong tong and then you see the sort of

Spinelli come tumbling down the chimney

and almost slash you in half but you get

out of the way and it just lands on the

ground with the clatter clatter clatter

clatter and it's just smoldering the

light I'm moving your ex tricks the

light has gone out

Chris Perkins

is paltin subconscious are you okay

buddy hanging in there

I believe Poland's down to single digit

hit points has paltin did paltin see the

sore yeah you saw the sort of Spinelli

and heard it clattered down into the

tunnel

so between the sword and the the the

unconscious son he's kind of doing the

Jim Carrey like so I was just lying

there on his back on fire

next next actually lying

so next action belongs to the creature

the creature is going to bite evylyn it

has advantage as it gnaws on her always

because she's yeah

evylyn you take you have suffered two

failed death saves and emotionally deal

with this

next up yeah this is this is very

strange for this game oh I can think of

all these fun conversations I'm gonna

have with all the characters me in this

game dead yeah the session started with

jokes

alright and then the rest of you hear

this rending noise and you hear clink

clink clink oh you don't think I and

peace all kinds of pieces of evylyn

begin to rain down the chimney and spill

around DF and Strix when you say pieces

are we talking Linz or just like little

metal chunks it's it sort of starts with

just nuts and bolts and torn off pieces

of armor and then an arm and then a leg

with a boot and then her torso and then

her head comes clattering down and just

rolls over to Paul tins feet oh no it's

it's it's okay he's probably used it as

an improvised weapon no it slipped no no

this is far this is fine if I ever feel

the need to do something then I'll do it

Simon's turn he gets to make a death

save okay he's just sort of stops

twitching and he's just on fire DF what

do you do the pole cannot get a turn I

guess gone yet he rolled a one on his

initiative we got past the we just got

past the surprise around and now we're

into the regular around where the order

initiative was strix than the creature

then Simon then DF then evil and then

Paul can I follow yeah

Simon still actually on fire he is on

fire

okay these are like just kind of

smoldering at this point okay granted

take the blanket that I was wearing and

use it to run over to Simon and use that

to put out okay whatever flame is yeah

it's so damp that you've pretty much to

smother him right away

yeah and just use that to put put out

the fire yeah uh and probably nice

tricks to put out a fire and after that

then I'm going to actually so I'll use

my sword like the blanket on him is that

considered like a I use an object yeah

okay so using like rogue fast hands like

I just toss it on there a cutting action

- to return back to Strix okay Amelie

tried to see if she needs to be

stabilized or whatever yeah they can do

to help her okay you can make a medicine

check to stabilize her okay do I have

that it's right no it's just if you

don't have it it's wisdom yeah great

great I rolled a one okay yeah you chop

off her head up yeah so that does not

stabilize her so she's continuing to

know to die and that's your action evil

as the creature sort of rips your party

Barton you don't even feel that really

it's just you know damage as far as

you're concerned but then you feel the

sudden separation of your soul from your

body and the soul is sort of drawn

through darkness into what looks like

the yawning mouth of a giant devil face

and as it descends down into that mouth

and sort of sinks into that abyss

suddenly you rise up or rather

materialize on what appears to be a

stone rooftop in a place you've never

seen before so let me paint you a

picture as you look around it appears

that there are many of these rooftops a

series of towers spread out in a kind of

greyish abyss with large space between

the towers and as you sort of look out

over the battlements of this tower roof

that you're standing on

toward those other towers you can see

there are lower down on the towers

struts or arches that connect all these

towers to each other but they are so

tall and so slender and they seem to go

down farther than you can possibly see

that there's just something very alien

about this place and the towers there is

a wind that seems to blow grit through

the air which also sort of obscures your

view of some of the farther away towers

and when you kind of look down there is

a reddish glow from below deep deep

below possibly where these towers meet

earth somewhere far below the next thing

you notice is over your head is a

gigantic swirling black vortex a huge

Maelstrom with black stormy clouds all

around it and that vortex seems to

funnel upward almost like a black

twister like you see in those videos of

twisters going through Kansas or

Oklahoma and that twister becomes almost

like this umbilical like shape that goes

off and attaches to some sort of big

black amorphous moon in the sky and you

look at that moon very closely and it

has limbs or something attached to it

but it's impossibly huge so the towers

the vortex swirling in the sky overhead

it is then that you notice that you are

not alone that there are other beings on

this rooftop and like you they are

spectral you appear to be a ghost of

yourself hovering on this rooftop and

you are looking at the spectral bodies

and visages of others on this rooftop

with you

does even know enough about the soul

monger to assume that that might be the

god baby you would safely say yes does

she recognize anyone else on this roof

make a perception check no please with

ander 14 so you notice that a few of the

three of the figures look familiar to

them you don't think you've seen them up

close but you saw them from a distance

one is a sort of scrawny scrappy looking

tiefling man and the other is a gnome in

a vest and the third is and is an elven

woman they appear to be the ghosts of

the acquisitions Inc battle balloon crew

who perished during that attack by Klaus

among the unrecognizable figures you see

is what appears to be an old woman

wearing the symbol of Lysander around

her neck and she appears to be

comforting a young boy who has a hard

time seems who seems almost leaning on

her even though they're both ghosts do I

recognize the young boy at all no you've

never seen him before and when you

arrive sort of all eyes kind of turn to

you because you're the new arrival

the gnome says I know you you did from

Omo you can see by the way you're

wearing your little winged boots but

they're just ghostly and sort of holding

you up over the the rooftop

is she a robot or human she Oh

that's a good question she is human uh

where are we the old woman says oh my

dear I think we're dead I just thought

for sure that I had one more death safe

yeah the bed I didn't tell you that the

bhajana had two other attacks that it

made as it ripped you apart I guess I'm

just processing what happened but that

seems to be an aberration that is evil

and against everything we stand for and

the latter Philander are you guys

waiting to destroy it's the tiefling

says no we're waiting for it to eat us

damn it mm-hmm I remember you always

were the realistic one um I don't want

to be eaten so I'm gonna try to destroy

it the the tiefling sort of just can't

help but laugh and then that elf just

smacks him on the back of the head back

of the neck I introduced myself to the

lady with the levander symbol okay and

the elf starts chastising the tiefling

and says don't make anybody more

miserable than they already are not in

your last moment of life

and when you go over to the old woman

I'm gonna let you make another

perception check when you're close to

her she lacks detail because she's sort

of a fuzzy ghost sort of colorless and

spectral but seventeen you actually do

recognize her or you believe you have

seen her but not in a long long time

possibly when you were a child and first

sort of tempted to join the clergy so

she is a legend in the Church of

Lysander her name is czar s just one

name she she is has long been a champion

of the church who took the faith to some

of the darkest corners of faerun and

educated people about Lysander then came

back to water deep and headed up the

church there for a while for a good

number of years you you can't believe

that this is her I'm even I'm even

Avalon how big my fate at your service I

miss she just stares at her like this

how did you end up here

ah well first there was a vampire and

then a doll and then you couldn't

destroy the doll and there was a ring

but not my ringing there were my souls

in in two rings but then there was a

different ring I'm sorry you're losing

me yeah by a tentacle thing you were you

were attacked by a femme was it a

vampire uh not this time this time I

just got bit by a tentacle thing oh she

says I'm so sorry I was something I

could do do you know straud he's the

worst

I've heard that name I know that there I

don't like him absolu imeem I don't know

if you have time I look we can you hear

a sound up ahead like sort of the air

being sucked out and then you see what

looks like a black orb come out of the

Maelstrom overhead and as it descends

you see it's got eyes in it and it

sprouts four tentacles even tries to

grab for her axe there's nothing there

she's just like grabbing for all of the

weapons no none of them are there

nothing's there oh they're coming back

the creature that's devouring our souls

is hungry it sends these entities to

grab hold of us and take us up into the

vortex isn't there something we can do

the morning Lord wouldn't want us to be

sucked into a evil vortex I have offered

many prayers to the morning Lord since

my arrival I have received no guidance

and no reply well you know where one or

more gathered in his name he will surely

hear so let's let's hold hands and she

tries to grab everyone's hands let's all

hold hands together and we'll lift our

praises to the morning Lord and I'm sure

he will answer you see some folks try to

sort of extend hands and their hands

sort of pass through each other there's

nothing really for them to hold on to

try so they just kind of try but

everybody seems amenable even him nerd

the tiefling recalcitrant soul that he

is does sort of mosey on over and become

part of the circle and there's a there's

like 13 of you up here all told you sort

of got the boy by the hand and the boys

got his other hand sort of with the

priestess at roughly that time another

ghost appears on this rooftop and it

appears to be the ghost of an orc

ah welcome stranger join us in prayer as

we lift our petitions to the morning

Lord he sort of reaches for something

and nothing's there I don't have my

weapons either it's real frustrating

isn't it

paltin you stare at the decapitated head

of evil and clearly deprived of life

Paulding just like drops to his knees

okay and just like picks it up it was

just like staring at it as you just sort

of roll it over like one of its eyes

pops open okay you see this the sparkle

in the eye is gone it's just right now

like those baby dolls worry if you tilt

it back guys that's exactly what I was

thinking are we still in initiative

yeah all right here by the way the

creature just roaring in pain high high

up in the darkness of that chimney that

roar at least tells you it's not getting

close all right

balm just sets it down it looks up and

it's just gonna hop on the mandolin and

then just fly straight up there all

right Alton disappears up the chimney

let's see the fly spell I believe you

can move 60 feet let me check that we're

all gonna die

yeah you can fly a sixty feet up the

chimney which gets so do you still have

your little candle so you can see sure

yeah you probably don't want to be

totally blind in the dark with this

thing yeah okay so your candle when you

get within like five feet of it just

like the movie alien where the alien

does in Tom Skerritt that moment where

Tom Skerritt turns and it's right there

in his face just sort of blended in with

the surrounding that's like the

experience you have you just sort of

come around this rocky chimney and boom

there it is in your light staring back

at you with a gaping spider Maw and a

whole bunch of burnt tentacles it looks

really bad off but very very angry and

all that would take it up and I think I

can do so

hopping on your mandolin and using it to

cast a fly would be an action and then

moving would be your movement you could

do a bonus action or something with a

bonus action might and might just end up

being some flare so it's just like right

in my face

yeah I'm just like a good day to die

buddy see who it's gonna be

and Paul tunes voice sort of echoes down

let's see

that's paltin strikes you have a death

save come on I'm hoping Oh nineteen one

success hooray alright good the creature

hmm

well it was denied its lunch and it

couldn't eat couldn't eat Evelyn Evelyn

all right uh hmm but it is really hurt

all right

it will attempt to attack paltin with a

tentacle rolls a17 cool all right this

is gonna hit it does

eight points of bludgeoning damage as it

wraps its tentacle around you right

after I say let's find out who it is

here Ashley I'm just like well guess

it's me and okay you here

Colton set I guess it's me

next is oh then it will make a bite

attack against balton Oh neat

all right it's definitely gonna hit you

so palton you have two failed death

saves as a result of the bite attack

okay no way Chris was I still invisible

were you invisible after getting hit by

a fireball Oh what do you still be

invisible but he's carrying the moon's

right true okay but you know what I'm

gonna I'm gonna say he's got

disadvantage on the attack role not the

matter so he can always hit you try to

hit you with a second tentacle actually

if you are still invisible which nothing

has dispelled it actually oh don't you

cast the fly from the mandolin so that's

fine so if you're still concentrating on

visibily spell it actually missed you

with both of its tentacles

okay guess it's not yet so little retcon

you're still alive okay okay

and thank you God

yeah very good and it is now Simon's

turn he's not doing anything

d/f what do you do huh

I keep trying to stabilize Strix to

admit that things like way up there

right like yeah it's at least 50 60 feet

up in the in the in the chimney oh my

god and Strix is still dying

what kind of action is it to stabilize

its in action okay yeah I at this point

its death is just set to complete

trembling and can can't barely like

actually think through actions right now

and he's just trying to stabilize Strix

okay another medicine check okay or

wisdom just wisdom 13 you stabilize her

she's no longer need to make that face

okay see I can do that I can do that and

so even though it's like way up there do

it would do I have a sense of where it

is or not a Celtic I could see it nope

okay great and that's mostly because the

chimney isn't perfectly smooth that sort

of ragged and jagged so you you don't

have a direct line of sight to it yeah

alright awesome cool yeah it's gonna is

there so we got stopped by this thing

what's directly forward if a ton I

wanted to continue down the path if he

was there if you were to continue down

the path and right now you're just using

Strix Lantern to see it goes for 30 more

feet and then appears to branch to the

left and right like it hits a

t-intersection

I hate it I'm just gonna stay there

restricts okay evylyn you you stand in a

circle your ghostly hands reaching out

for one another you can see more of

those black orbs have come out and

they're sort of heading off to other

towers where you can see tiny ghostly

figures on those rooftops as well and

the one coming down toward you as it

extrudes along tentacles reaches down

and grabs

the tea fling you see you see that as it

wraps its brother it's black tentacles

around him nur the tentacles become

spectral as well and they just coil

around his ghost rip him out of the

circle and bear him up into the sky he's

screaming I hope you choke on me does my

any of my auras work here no you don't

sense the presence of any auras can I

try to weep for him and grab him you do

have your flying boots yeah you can you

leap up at him and you just pass right

through him

as he is born away okay ah let us pray

she grabs her hands you return back down

to the the rest of you you can see both

the elf and the gnome are just kind of

looking up their faces long and drawn

and just the horror of watching their

friend torn away from them has not yet

sunk in then you see Hitler go up into

the black even has just like laser focus

cuz she literally cannot do anything so

she's just like she grabs RS his hand

from where she left the circle and she

boughs her head she's like Xander you

set me on a quest I haven't finished it

yet and I do not think it's your will

for me to be swallowed by a black god

baby that is evil please help us and

she'd shake star s and she's like you're

better at this than me please go

you can see as she looks toward you I do

sense something strange about you

something different than all the other

ghosts I've seen since I arrived yes and

then she starts murmuring a prayer even

though she knows there's no light that

shines in this place there's no Sun to

see or worship she does believe that

levander is watching over you all and

then after she sort of mumbles this

prayer in her old woman voice she turns

to you and she says I feel there is hope

there's always hope

and then the Thunder speaks to me of

parables and the worm in the Apple the

Apple that's what he told you just now

he says you are the worm in the Apple I

have no water in the Apple

that's not good no I I'm not sure it

doesn't sound nice

oh I mean I know a thing about some

worms that are in a place but I don't

have one of those I wonder if that's

what he's talking about I know some

pretty gross evil worms that are gonna

if you're the worm then this is the

Apple oh oh oh I see

evylyn kind of takes a shuddering breath

and she like closes the circle of hands

and she says made a lot of Lysander

shine upon you and bless you

and then she I don't believe in young

gods that's okay just turn your face to

the light and all will be revealed and

she she like gives a very deep like

thankful about Tsar s and then she goes

to throw herself in front of one of the

tentacle blob things okay paulten you

are snared yeah

by candlelight in front of this creature

okay back here sorry back back here um

okay blind rage shot up to them amen

well visibility doesn't matter now so

trying to think what do they do what do

I do

that's the best thing you could blast

them or stab ya think of all the things

that we talked about at the start of the

episode no poems more like going through

okay it's just like what do I say what's

what's my line

like he goes up and he's about to say

something or he goes I had oh well

and I'm gonna just cast a thunder wave

like right on a metric level okay he has

to make a constitution saving through

that's our rage der wave mm-hm

alright he would fail that safe but he's

going to use his legendary resistance to

succeed instead cool great so whole

thing I believe you did half damage okay

it won't push him away I I didn't think

he had much place to go yeah so uh okay

so I'm just gonna use a generator can I

save us some time

that would be 31 so half of that okay

so 15 all right

he is blasted by those ripples of sonic

energy that tear through its body you

see its flesh peel away and you

obliterate it oh yeah you did exactly

one more point of damage than you needed

to kill it

all right so DF they're the this sort of

horrid crap starts raining down the

chimney it's not paltin it seems to be

after mentioned the creature okay all

right paltin you still have some

movement left if you want to use it just

gonna float my way back down okay

and palton sinks back down the shaft and

he's sort of covered with gore and he's

got like it very few hit points left

yeah just gonna like make my way back to

his candles still lit my candle still a

very important I'm gonna go back to who

to the to the evil in the head okay all

right that will complete your movement

and Strix is stable the bhajana is no

more yes are we still an initiative uh

for the purposes of a narrative yes

since okay sure I'll switch back and

forth between you and evilly

yeah this just kind of felt like

basically and they're like cradling

unconscious tricks in seas paulten this

kind of slowly felt down and I imagine

she's almost kind of lands like it's his

back turns towards ya

as he's felting like you should look at

evil in hell think dear

yes Kant doesn't know what to say and

can't say anything but keeps looking

down the hallway of where they were

going and is yeah just just wait for

Alton okay

yep Alton's down Pontins by a villains

head right now okay and then evylyn you

fly away from the circle zur s says up

to you everything will be alright

know that you're loved I know thank you

and she just says a prayer to quietly to

herself as she goes all right Gander

bless my soul and use it for your holy

purpose save my friends and let their

souls find rest or let them stay alive

and do your holy purpose and let them

 and she's just on and on and on as

she just hurdles toward alright yeah you

see that one of these spheres with the

tentacles has in its clutches a a

middle-aged woman sort of pale and thin

and she's crying and screaming and

railing against it but is unable to

escape from its grasp

clearly plucked her from another one of

the towers I tried to and as you as you

look around you also see like there's

like eight or ten of them all with

spirits of people in their clutches

heading back up into the male

from I was trying to go for one that was

like maybe about to grab somebody and

like shove myself in instead okay

when you fly over to one and interpose

yourself I would like you to make a

charisma can I make a persuasion yes

sweet take me instead

NAT twenty Jesus okay it was when it

wraps its tentacles when it wraps his

tentacles around you

yeah this is like one of those is it a

happy not 20 or yeah wait as it wraps

its tentacles around you you feel like

these tentacles are just made of pure

negative energy like these creatures

exist wholly within the negative energy

realm and it it burns its or tears at

the very fabric of your spirit it takes

everything that you have just this even

holier cohesion together as a soul as it

wraps itself around you and flies toward

the black swirling vortex and the

twister and the umbilical leading to the

horrible horrible abomination I think

she screams out in pain okay and yeah

you are drawn up into the vortex make a

perception check okay you can see as you

are drawn up toward the vortex as you

look back down below the towers it is an

entire city of towers that seem to

almost have no bottom these sort of

descend and descended to send it descend

with sort of arches connecting them

almost forming the stone web beneath

them you see what looks like a fiery

Maelstrom like a burning lava pit or

something some gigantic burning lava sea

but it shimmers and it's sort of covered

with all kinds of smoke and blowing ash

the other thing you notice is all that

grit you saw blowing in the wind are

actually like skin flakes

that are sort of caught up in this thing

but what you notice with your natural 20

is that the towers some of them you can

see are shuttering and crumbling at the

bottom and one of the towers sort of

collapses and sinks with a dull Rumble

into the fiery abyss breaking breaking

all the sort of stone bridges and arches

that connect it to its nearest neighbors

as it goes down this isn't something

that like is a natural occurrence here

this is something that's like starting

to happen yes she smiles through the

pain alright paltin so he sends the head

back down and just kneels next to it and

he kind of puts his head down and goes

levander you punk I swear to God

if you don't give her back I will find

you and I don't know what I'll do

you're like a god supposedly I don't

know that's kind of hard to tip but

regardless I will find you and I will

give you such a scolding and then I

would all come back with a better plan

next time hallowed be thy name

by the light of something God you think

I wouldn't I would know how this goes by

now its gg

and then he stands up and he's like I've

done all I can do okay so she's not dead

guys it's fine she's she's not dead she

it's it's just it's it's fine it's fine

it's good Simon oh God Simon you just

see a blanket in in sort of Simon's

shape lying on the ground just like hey

can I can I can I heal the boy when you

pull back the blanket you see that

there's just this burnt sort of boy

shaped hunk of wood and metal lying on

the on the floor of the tunnel you don't

see any like his face is burnt off oh he

just got that uh you can try I'm gonna

absolutely try to heal him any want yeah

I'm gonna go ahead and just looked just

one look at him it's like say um he's

fine to watch Chad here we go I'm gonna

well it's my mandolin so it's a hand so

you play a magical healing song all

right miss tricks is still unconscious

yeah strikes is still unconscious oh

yeah well okay yeah is he yours weren't

burnt off he'd be able to explain Oh God

come back to me on that alright I'll

come back to you on that he plays are

you Jamie Rae just see go go

okay yeah that you know paltin really

needs a his own song list like his yeah

mm-hmm all right

that being said paltin will start to

play the mandolin playing a tune and at

least as you start playing there doesn't

seem to be any response or any sense

that the healing is taking hold of this

incinerated puppet it's a it's a it's a

it's a delayed reaction it's a delayed

response it was a poor song choice I'm

sorry it'll work though and we are back

to DF DF you see paltin standing over

playing his music to Riva the fie Simon

evylyn yes

make a perception check 15 as you are

drawn up into the black vortex you you

look down upon the rooftop that you left

his arrests and the little boy and all

those others on there the last thing you

see is the ghost of Simon appear on that

rooftop okay and then you are whipped up

through the vortex

the twister into or along it through it

into the gullet of something so vile

that you your divine sense is not gone

it's your body sort of is gone but you

your sense is still there it becomes

just absolutely overwhelming this undead

monstrosity this immensity that you are

basically sucked into the gullet of for

it to feed on is unlike any evil you

have ever faced before this is basically

an unborn god that you have been cast

into when you descend into it do you do

anything or think anything or say

anything I think that this is so counter

to everything even I mean she has she

has a thing about dirt right but she's

like literally surrounded by the most

vile thing possible and being consumed

by it so like and I think she she knows

she's at her demise so I think pretense

is lost so I think she was just like I

think she starts screaming and it

becomes like almost a high-pitched like

ringing sound and she just doesn't stop

like The Princess Bride scream ringing

across the land like I don't think she

does much but try to just endure for her

holy mission

the last thing you feel is your spirit

just sort of blown asunder by your

belief and you become this Sun and all

the spirits down below you they just see

the sunbeams tear through the body of

this black moon that hovers over their

heads and one of those beams sort of

falls upon the ghosts on the platform

you left behind and shines upon his

arrest and she says take that even

smiles and that's where we'll stop okay

cool you know I learned a lesson today

what healing spells that I should use

before fireball yeah actually one coda

to this great paltin oh hi DF and Strix

my name all your hit point maximums are

restored to full get wreck that's good

that's like 50 back for me yeah I mean

you're a hit points stay the same your

current hit points stay the same but

your maximum hit points are now back up

where they should be okay so I feel

better but I don't correct you still

feel battered and bruised you haven't

actually healed any damage but the death

curse on you has ended

cool so today went well yeah you're

welcome enjoy the rest of the campaign

no I've got ideas I've got ideas yeah

well I'm a son so have fun with your

ideas no it's no it's fine

no if I got it I got it alright

everything can come back it's fine

everything's fine I mean and also Simon

sure was short-lived that wasn't

actually that I mean yeah he doesn't

have a lot of hip points you knew it was

a bad idea that he was there regardless

he did not he rolled uh he wrote like a

two on his save too and that didn't help

so no see it's fine because no matter

what we still have a piece of evil and

soul so way down it's got to be serviced

something right mm-hmm

we do yep food for thought no pun

intended

yeah you know we're gonna have to ask no

we're not we are absolutely not
