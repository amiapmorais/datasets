hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action Before we jump into today's

episode I'd like to welcome back our

special guest star hadiyyah-lah Masari

who's playing a beloved character and

thank you thank you for joining us ray

I'm a favorite yes anyway Nana would be

here except she's she's celebrating with

her real friends I guess no seriously we

do miss her and we will miss evylyn as

well

previously in dice camera action at the

urging of the Dwarven mage al Coria

stone mero the waffle crew sat down with

water deeps foremost psychic Exorcist

the halfling dr. serenity thanks him off

and boy did they need that session after

spending a day at the beach more

recently the waffle crew returned home

to find a package on their doorstep

addressed to one Audra

nel K n e L L it contained a rug of

smothering that attacked paltin twice

and D F once before fleeing the scene it

liked me more the waffle crew learned

that Audra nel is a wizard who

disappeared many months ago according to

a raven headed doorknocker outside black

staff tower

Audra had enemies and specialized in

dimensional magic when the waffle crew

got home they were horrified to discover

that the gift Commodore Warrington Mundt

who had been acting strangely for a few

days had turned into a hulking mind

flare they killed him and were about to

begin the search for the waffle kids who

appear to be missing

so Warrington Mundt in this new horrific

form lies dead at your feet on the

second floor of the Waffle House in the

hall he fell onto this level after Strix

cast a pass walls fell underneath his

feet he was on the level above and he

was put down by the waffle crew and has

is now bleeding out all over the floor

clearly dead having been killed by

weapons and spells all is quiet once

more except of course for the noises

that you guys make whatever

screaming so we're picking up like right

yes yeah the last one exactly yeah Strix

is just on the crown crying she doesn't

know what to do I guess I really

shouldn't be laughing so hard at the

person in chat that just said ding dong

the gif is dead I think that's worth it

I think that's worth a laugh that's

worth a laugh it's dark but you know wow

so is our show evylyn alarmed that the

waffle kids are not responding to her

calls to come out of hiding decides to

take flight once more to leave the

building to see if there are any signs

of them outside or in the neighborhood

she also knows that if things really got

bad they'd probably go across the street

to follow and so she's gonna check with

them yeah I just imagined she me they

flew off to find the children right away

yeah and her calls of the children's

names get farther and farther away

sounding right I will go upstairs and

actually look at Warrington's

room okay when you climb the stairs

you're now up on the third floor which

is still one level below Warrington's

room you see that there's a broken plank

covered window where you through the

palton doppelganger

out several sessions ago there are some

other windows looking over at the front

of the street as well through which some

moonlight is streaming there's no sign

of the hole in the floor that warrington

fell through because that was a magical

hole Edison's dissipated but you do see

that there is some damage in this

upstairs hall and you're standing right

at the point where the stairs go

downstairs and another flight of stairs

goes upstairs to your room and

Warrington's but to your right you see a

door has been torn off its hinges and

reduced to smithereens it is the door to

the library study which is on the third

floor but you guys have never used that

room it's at the back of the house and

it's pretty much been closed up the

entire time you've been there we didn't

have enough books right no one got

strict's any books cuz she's not a

wizard right so that door has been

ripped off its hinges broken inward by

obviously a great force you can imagine

that being Warrington Munsch now why he

would want to break down the door to get

in there you have no idea cuz there's

nothing there

at least nothing that you're aware of

was this the this wasn't the room he was

typically staying in no he was staying

the level above across from you in the

Attic in the attic storage room right

and I would assume that's where the guns

are kept yes noted huh I guess where you

just have this big of a house you just

forget about all the rooms inside mm-hmm

yeah so so you notice that you don't

have to necessarily do anything about it

I just pointed out as being odd right

but which tricks and I came up here we

were hearing I'm one floor directly

above and when she did the pass wall

saying this tree fell down from yeah

which would have been right outside the

library study right okay well I would

like to at least especially the broken

hinges and stuff that why at least peer

into the library yeah it's clear looking

at the hinges and stuff that he must

have just thrown his full weight up

against the door

probably because it was keylock - he

couldn't open it or god knows why but he

wanted to get in there quickly when you

peer into the library study it is dusty

dark quiet the drapes are pulled over

the windows so there's no light from the

outside coming in and the shelves are

bare there's a desk in the middle of the

room between the two windows and a tall

chair behind it they too are dusty and

have cobwebs strung across them but is

otherwise uh not worthy that's correct

for a librarian like nothing out of this

unusual no it's it's as empty and

neglected as you would expect it to be

under normal circumstances huh all right

now I'm not getting much from that

immediately and then I'll continue my

way up to you Warrington's bedroom okay

you climb the steps heading to the top

floor and can see your bedroom door

closed on the one side and then

Warrington's door open on the other and

you can hear strange whirring noises

almost mechanical coming from

Warrington's room strikes balton yo

Strix hasn't moved from the corpse yet

if you want to get her you have to drag

her away

well I'm here what seems to be the

problem bud large uns bedroom there's

yeah you're kind of on the landing

looking up at the stairs at the open

door to Warrington's room on one side of

the hall and you can hear the whirring

and clicking noises of something

mechanical mm-hmm he's probably working

on a super gun and it's dark otherwise

that must be it I'll go check it out

you'll need a light I can i fairy fire

myself yes you'll be easier to hit but

yeah absolutely

why is that a factor I'm not saying it

is I'm just saying you would know that

oh wait I have wait I have dancing

lights that's even better you can create

these and mobile basically torch lights

that you can move around cool they're

gonna like spin around me in a pretty

dance okay so you are brave you are

brightly lit as you make your way up the

staircase toward Warrington's room when

you get just before you get to the point

in the doorway where you can see

anything into the room the whirring and

clicking stops as do I can I can I be

invisible real quick dancing lights and

oh wait we may not wait dancing dancing

lights is one minute its concentration

invisibility is checking just to be sure

concentration so one your dancing lights

would end if you become invisible okay

well then I will just keep the dancing

lights up okay I'm gonna like have them

go into the room that you can do and

just see what happens when they

disappear around into the open doorway

into the room the room becomes lit but

you're not at a point where you can

actually see in it but the good news is

there isn't some reaction

other than the room being lit up nothing

seems to go off or nobody you know you

don't hear screams or any surprise that

the lights being sent in okay the room

is now silent and lit okay if it's been

like 15 minutes Strix will eventually

stand up and shuffle up the stairs to

find everyone okay yeah she gets up the

stairs about halfway up and she realizes

one of her boots is kind of making a

squishing sound and that's because the

blood from the lines layer basically

pooled around her feet and now she's

tracking it all upstairs oh great she

doesn't notice at all she's used to the

Hat fallen hears it and like immediately

turns around and loudly is like I can't

hear us

just keeps walking and ignores that

making her way up to D F on the

staircase now we're going to flip from

the Waffle House across town to a

section of the C ward that at this time

of night is pretty quiet in fact most of

the C Ward is because it's very it's one

of the richer neighbourhoods and the

nights here seem to be very tranquil

there are lots of big estates

walled compounds old money but among

their residences is mystras arms The

Asylum and in her office in the asylum

sits dr. vex him off and dr. your

assistants have returned wonderful I'm

so glad you're back

you turn and greet them and you realize

two of them are holding up the third who

is just either dead or unconscious in

their arms looking at the the distress

to its body you think that they have

been subject to possibly a thunder wave

spell and the three mind flayers

the two of them just sort of drop the

third to the floor and then one of them

says to you telepathically we couldn't

talk to her well there yes disappointing

we were in the early when one of them

left out of the shadows but attacked us

some sort of half man/half that picture

oh yeah yes that's just terrible well oh

he's leaking all over the floor and I

have to mop that up later um well I'm

glad that you two are okay is he dead

oh well we'll have to replace him and

the whole training process is just gonna

be awfully do you know how much I hate

onboarding new

so the customer table won't yeah we

better actually let's make two as a

spear we're already a little

understaffed let's get rid of this one

we'll make two more they will they will

pick him up and drag him out of your

office dr. sexy mouth will like throw

one of her she'll open a desk drawer

that she has and we'll take one of her

many doilies and like toss it over like

the wet spot like yeah it should just

like kind of like very gingerly cover it

and arrange it the doily kind of soaks

up the black yeah yeah no she'll just

throw another one on top now you know

you're you're staying rather late

tonight because you've been busy with

one of your more difficult patients but

when the cleaning staff comes through

they'll probably take care of that for

you you might just want to push that rug

off to the side so it doesn't like leach

over onto that with my little photo I'll

push it and put like a like a small like

a halfling sized like wet floor sign oh

really

little tip yeah yeah okay

and then I will after after my

assistants have disposed of the dead

mine flare

I would like to resync up with them okay

yeah you can go downstairs they're sort

of tossing the dead mine flare down a

chute and when they turn to you they

they have recommendations for which

patients are probably most likely

candidates for the Sarah morphic

procedure okay I will ask them to bring

me like the candidates in like a nice

file folder and I'll look through them

and I will pick you know just the the

most lost cause somebody who's never

gonna leave this

facility I want to give them a new life

a better life as as a good mind fleeing

citizen so I'm gonna pick the worst Oh

cute yes then they will take those names

and make sure that those prisoners are

implanted okay and as they go I'll be

like make sure you take your 15 minute

breaks I don't want to have any sort of

OSHA violation not again we can't afford

another fine yeah

and and one of them will turn to you and

say horrible what about the warning come

on people

oh I'm just so sad about that Torrington

might I guess there's not really a lot

we can do there do they know you know

what the process of cirrhosis will be

complete we are we have that going for

us I suppose

hmm I guess we'd better collect him huh

so I I think I will go back into my

office I will get my adorable owl bear

shaped wicker bag mm-hmm and put in a

couple extra doilies yeah I will grab

them oh go ahead

yeah I was gonna say you were thinking

about heading home anyway so I was gonna

leave anyway but I might as well make a

stop I will grab a couple new legal pads

and some of my nicer pens and then I

will take a very thick case file off of

my shelf that just says strikes on it

put that in my bag and some

significantly smaller like single manila

folders and I will put those one says

doors and the other one says palton all

right when you head out the the Nightman

down

stairs make sure that a coach is called

for you and so you don't have to wait

long you just sort of stand under the

portico when this thing rolls up in the

driveway to pick you up okay

before I get into the coach I'll wave to

my my assistants and I will say make

sure I know we're really good at the

process at this point let's just be sure

peek in on them make sure they don't

need any snacks we have some good Barry

Lacroix in the fridge they get thirsty

and watch out for the patient in room 17

she is a biter so and you know

infectious those two I'll be back in a

little while don't stay too late and

I'll have a huge okay they they bow

before you and withdraw to the shadows

of the asylum as you are ushered into

the carriage by the driver and borne to

the Waffle House and when you arrive

there you see it is kind of a dark

looming structure last time you here was

during the day it was much more pleasant

here at night you don't particularly

care for the look of this place it's

dour countenance as it glares down upon

you with vacant windows I will step out

of the carriage and look up at the house

I'm still afraid it's gonna fall on me

and crush me I am very small I say you

can understand the stress that I'm under

and I will will go up to the door and

hesitantly knock on it but not gonna

last the door I feel when you go up you

realize it's not completely closed

oh don't that sounds right yeah I won't

quite invite myself in but I'll like

poke my little head in really hello it's

me dr. serenity the door kind of creaks

open after about a minute very slowly

and you see that there is an energy beam

that's actually opening the door and

then this this little white orb with

four stumpy eyestalks

and poking from around the corner very

trepidatious Lee with a big central I

looking at you warily its little I'd I

stalks kind

twitching nervously and you see it's got

a tiny little wizard's hat on well

biscuit every did this little floating

grapefruit-sized orb kind of gives you a

strange look and he's just kind of

drooling out of one side of its mouth

uncontrollably I will take a very dainty

embroidered handkerchief out of my

pocket and dab at be okay it starts to

kind of chew on it are your parents

[Music]

guardians the people that live here I

think there are four of them are they

here

I can't I'd like to speak kind of makes

us sound like and looks off in a

direction and goes with all of its eyes

kind of looking inward oh I'm pretty

sure I've heard that before

yeah same I also forgot about the robe

so I just kind of throw the hood up in

like I just I'm just like that's I'll

see like that's alby's word for it's not

someone dangerous I'll go down and check

on it I got this mari no this slosh

slosh shuffle downstairs you initiates

like you hear creaking floorboards in

the depths of the house a dr. Paul is

trying to compete and get down there

first then you see this black cloaked

figure come riding down the banister of

the spiral staircase and crash at the

bottom of the taproom perfect I imagine

this is like two siblings where everyone

wants to get down first and then Paul to

disorient going faster just moping after

landing at the bottom the staircase

palton sort of springs up just a

standing pose how would you find earlier

reports my favorite contrarian Paul

tonight he would know that silliness

anywhere I am my identity I do assume

that's money trick smokes up behind him

and just looks the doctor and she's like

oh hi doctor don't tell her anything

I know that the last time we met you

told me to practice

lots of self-care and mindfulness or

whatever that is and instead we just got

mind flayers oh I can see where the

confusion would be they both have the

word mind in them but I bet you did more

self pure no sorry my computer is being

mean to me today uh hmm no I just killed

I just killed one of our dear if there's

like any sort of sitting like anywhere I

can sit I'm gonna put like several

doilies and just like sit and my feet

don't reach the ground so they just like

swing it's very charming okay yeah

sticks is just like well today I killed

one of our dear friends and impaled and

paled a baby chick on a knife and had to

watch it die where's your costume

costume knows your identity now

well of coffee pots in that robe is evil

you should take it off it used to belong

to man soon who is evil are you evil

paulten it doesn't work on me it just

makes me tonight all this like take off

my boots start dumping out the blood as

this is going on doctor you said

something that you didn't detect in the

house previously a presence here but

strangely distant almost like the echo

of someone trapped in the house okay

do I recognize like who the presence

would belong to no you've you sense

though that there's it's an intelligence

it's not some it's it's a person or

somebody intelligent okay is there

anything I can roll to like covertly

figure out who it might be

or you can make an insight check Oh make

it infect you know my character

[Music]

18 you sense that it is someone who is

not in control of their own mind and it

seems to be someone in the house on a

higher level than this ground-floor

green and and do you think that they are

confused do do I think that the other

members of the house know who it is just

somebody that I've met before you know

actually on time actually yes it is

someone you've met before it might be

someone from your case files then the

the mind is been twisted since you

touched at last

but this mind reminds you of a wizard

you met over a year ago a deeply

profoundly troubled wizard who thought

everyone was out to kill her hmm

the person we're looking for they live

in our house great all right well I will

motion for you have your file so you can

remember her name oh yeah can I look

through my file bag to see you like

anything connects you can do that right

now

they'll all be staring at you of course

but absolutely that's fine I'm used to

it by now

um so I'll pull out my files like Strix

is incredibly sick one you got your old

notebook you like your current one there

might be a note or a jotted remark in

there that might remember

mind you as I'm as I'm flipping through

this tonight raised suspicions I'm gonna

ask you know I know they had a couple

different other people live in this

house all right is it is it just you two

tonight ORS there's some other people

here this is only us two there's no one

else here there's no snow evylyn is gone

hmm

she went to go look for the kids because

they ran away or something we don't

actually know where they are after they

were attacked we were attacked dieppe is

upstairs I think yes

are you still upstairs let's cut the

death and find out I don't see him do

you see him doctor

oh no where did he go see he's gone I

feel like you're I feel like you're

pandering never I would never do that to

you Paul I would never do that to you

ever in my life don't ruin this for me I

need this all right DF yeah

what do you up to well they went into

the door and I am just under the

impression that it's like a customer or

something right so while they do that

I'm going to do my best to inspect

Warren's room especially the potential

source of these mechanical noises what

are you losing for a light source

once paltin flees the scene she's gonna

grab one of those dancing mites they're

not solid I know I'm sure I have

something nearby well my room is nearby

I can just easily hop over there and

grab one of my lanterns or torches yeah

my usual light sources okay bring back

over with me all right so you've got a

conventional lantern yeah yeah which you

shine into Warrington's room the first

thing you immediately notice is there is

all kinds of there's a black she

over the walls yeah almost like a slick

slimy resin that has solidified in

patches and just sort of covered the

walls and made them almost rib like

corrugated in a way this corrugated

black resin and it's uneven and there

are paths there are places in the walls

where you can actually still see the

wood and the women the windows for the

most part seem to be clear although

they're sort of splashed with this stuff

and it's sort of like a brown glaze over

them I'll come on a globe to this rear

black resin tea stuff and you can it's

right inside the door too so you don't

have to go very far into the room but as

you're casting your light around you can

see that there are some contraptions

about as well as some papers there's a

there's a paper on the floor that

contains what appears to be a drawing

that you remember Warrington pitching

you the idea of the cannon turret yeah

it appears to be a schematic that he

showing that you can also see that

there's a weird box with what appeared

to be some wires and stuff as well as

pieces of things that look like

disassembled firearms hmm reattached in

weird ways but the thing that's weirdest

is in the middle of the room next to one

of the rafters is a device made out of

what appears to be a costume mannequin

they wouldn't mannequin but it's got

weird things added to it including what

appeared to be bunny ears like wirele

tall wire loops stuck into its head

and nothing about this mannequin is

recognizable otherwise no it looks like

a modified mannequin that he was

probably tucked away back here in the

Attic with a bunch of other junk yeah

just when you touch when you touch the

resin I'd like you to make a will

sorry wisdom saving through why why did

you touch it it clearly looked like it

was from alien yeah it looked like

subtext Rick's wanted I was gonna get

earpiece oh no that was your first

mistake

30:20 okay yeah when you when you touch

it you get kind of a psychic jolt in

your brain like just a flash of some

mental distress

do I determine if it's still safe to

maybe retrieve the beasts or ours like

while I was like it Sue's like i touch

it it's like yeah it's just they're very

instantaneous flash painful to your

brain but not so painful that it damages

you right you didn't have that much

contact with it your natural instinct to

recoil protected you from what could

have been psychic damage

okay well then natural deaath instincts

will kick in at this point just be like

nope not yeah but it's almost like this

resin is a concentrate of negative

expelled emotion yeah or psychic damage

okay well it's gonna stay away from that

from now and I don't see anything that's

possibly generating this stuff it just

it's like patchy all over yeah it's like

if somebody had based on the way it's

kind of spread along the walls and and

and dripped down it's almost like it

exploded outward from some source in the

room and just sort of plastered

everything and then just sort of drooled

its way down but it's not quite that

simple okay well I suppose I'll just

kind of keep I'll move past that shuffle

and put the lantern down somewhere they

tried to examine the rest of the room

the papers the possibility exact

location where the mechanical noises

came from when you set the lamp down on

the floor you see that there are

drawings on the floor itself in chalk

and those drawings are of some sort of

map a configuration of rooms corridors

and doors that connect them and it seems

to cover the floor I wish to transcribe

this that will take some time yeah but

you have the papers around you to do it

yeah yeah I might need to come back to

it after checking with the others but I

don't want it disturbed okay because it

does occur to you right now that it's

very very strange for a customer to show

up at this hour of the night

heck no no

go back up there at some point because

I'm really not interested in cutting

back to you guys right now so yeah as

soon as you see ducks you see the doctor

getting at all these different files and

papers and laying them out on the table

in front of her like she's looking for

something I'd like to also to imagine

that DF has like water deep guard like

police tape and he's like put police

tape around just says property of water

D police do not pass or something

she's like laying out papers I'm just

like alright I'm bored

[Laughter]

doctors eczema is not going to like

force him to go through therapy if he

doesn't want to so she'll just dismiss

them if he doesn't want to be here she's

only works as if your choice if you

resisted this do anything anyway that's

true that's pretty smart so you can just

talk about your pulse and business mr.

Batman and I will just is it with my

good friends I've had us for the day I

knew the right answer yeah heads

upstairs yes cope getting caught on a

nail at some point it's a little stumble

as he's walking just walk he's like om

the night damnit tonight

Dylan has same slippers by the way right

oh yeah vampire slippers yeah so stress

tricks you have a momentary reprieve

from the dark night when he retreats

upstairs and you're alone with the

halfling and Albie yeah I'll just be

scratching Albie and just be like yeah

nice Oh cute little treat yeah yeah

thanks for coming back doctor I haven't

done anything right since the last time

I saw you I just keep killing friends

and I don't know about that when you see

you killed your friend are we talking

metaphorically or literally No

oh no it's a little girl iterally his

body is right up there in the stairs and

I wasn't very nice to him before then

because he was weird and had too many

guns and and I feel really guilty

because I wasn't even nice to and then

he just died and I had to kill him with

a lightning bolt in the chest and he

pretty much exploded I see well I

understand your guilt and it's okay to

feel your feelings you don't have to get

along with everybody you encounter not a

lot of common interests you don't think

I should kill them it's probably correct

probably correct there um was there any

particular reason for the lightning bolt

oh yeah he was a hippo man and then he

was a mind flare oh do you know why that

would happen you know I have some

theories but perhaps we could go

together you and I get some closure I

could take a look at the body with you

all right

and then I will hop off whatever surface

I will collect my doilies fold them up

con Maori style and they all spark joy

and Carlos tricks as you're collecting

up your things and packing them up strix

you notice that there is blood falling

through a crack in the floor above and

just sort of splashing down on the floor

of the tap room this is Warrington's

blood seeping through the cracks in the

floor yeah he's up there yeah is it

landing on me no it's just missed you by

a few feet it's splashing down on a

stool next to the where you keep your

pastries on display great um I just look

at it I'm like hey Albie can you clean

that up just please thank you thank you

thank you I know I know there's no need

for backtalk today I'll be I know I'm

sorry

alright palton as you get upstairs to

the level

right below where DF is so the third

level of the house there's moonlight

coming through a couple windows and you

can see that there is this library study

that you have absolutely zero interest

in with the door smashed it is from

there that you hear Simon's voice and

Simon Says Simon Says huh yeah maybe I

don't know I'm not sure

he says you first you hear him scream ah

I got him I think he's dead alright good

job son I should go check on that

alright okay fine I'll check on my son

when you go into the library and study

there's no one there

find the thing located say our son is

not a thing

find the son she's not right locate

creature right so you cast this and one

action later you try to use it to track

Simon he is according to the spell in

the room about 10 feet away from you

standing possibly on the desk which by

the way you can see with your own eyes

has no one standing on it well

metagaming I have an idea what's going

on but realistically sorry man

my son where are you you got no response

don't make me count to three one

- your spell registers he's not around

anymore he's not in range things broken

okay well then I will he's not in here

I'm gonna look up in that other room

okay so you head upstairs and reunite

with DF DF I like walk up behind him

like really quietly and it's like really

loudly just like right behind him

Commissioner Woodrow what did you find

can you just not see if this plane well

he has been bumping into a couple things

oh yeah I definitely heard them yeah you

probably did right away diesel just say

stay away from that stuff it's it's

pulses evil

there's maps all over it all kinds of

papers and oh no there's a lot going on

here I'm gonna need some time to really

examine it it's like what stuff you just

like Polk said just plain all right so

you have a number of things you can poke

at when you sort of look around in the

lantern light and one of them is the

mannequin with the rabbit ears know one

of them is this weird box that's sort of

enclosed on three sides but open on

another sitting on top of another box

with some wires going into it I mean you

could put your hand in that I guess I

kind of assumed he was talking about

them oh the residue the black resin

stuff yeah that stuff's all over the

place you gonna touch that why shouldn't

I touch it make a wisdom saving throw

okay give it a second now 20 okay you

you also feel that psychic damage would

have been visited upon you had you not

been a little bit more careful and

pulled your hand away before it could

damage you the will of the night is too

strong

yes we'll say that's why I don't touch

it

spoopy oh my god that is that thing is

hot all right see it it was me Palme the

whole time he needs to be safe with you

can you keep the secret I could do this

for your friend thank you I appreciate

it

strexy lead doctor thanks I'm off

upstairs is that the plan yeah I'm gonna

lead her to the body and I'm gonna be

like I don't really want to look at the

body yeah on the second floor at the

bottom of the staircase leading up to

the third floor doctor you can see this

titanically big mind flayer like about

seven feet tall

splayed out on the floor and clearly he

was murdered this thanks for excited it

was murder and there's enough of a

uniform a torn uniform worn by this

creature to remind you that it could be

their their gift friend who obviously

underwent a Sarah Moore Phasis can I not

your head not your handiwork but I will

say that internally clearly not one of

mine

internally by definition means no I felt

like she was saying can I inspect the

body of this yes okay and for that

you'll want to make like let's say an

investigation check if you're trying to

draw some conclusions

that is gonna be 22 excellent so you can

conclude now it's obvious how he died

these guys killed him but it's it's also

clear to you that he was probably you'd

venture implanted with a mind flayer

tadpole before he even met them and so

this since he transformed you believe

just recently you think that he was

probably implanted a couple months ago

and it's likely to based on because that

that Sarah Morpheus is you know mostly

takes hold in humanoids and a gif is a

humanoid so he was definitely eligible I

after doing my inspection and coming to

this conclusion I will turn to Strix and

ask how long have you known this this

friend of yours very long perhaps how

long have we known Warrington like

probably like four months five months

yeah that's about right

yeah so yeah I'll just look at her and

say it's about five months ish he seemed

fine I mean he was always a little bar

mean like guns a lot and I think he was

from space but other than that hmm he

did shoot himself out of a cannon into a

mindful airship and then explode it and

then ended up here I think that's how he

became a Commodore because they thought

he was dead

I'm not sure the other hippo people told

us that well he sounds like an exciting

fellow shooting himself out of cannons

no it was an exciting fellow the two of

you hear someone come down the stairs

you hear the creaking of the stairs but

you don't see anyone on the stairs

okay well there's probably ghosts in

here now No how fine since why is that

fun what's wrong with you well it's just

interesting I just think ghosts are neat

I think I need a new therapist I don't

think there's anything I can do to find

to see that whatever this is but maybe I

can and um let's see no that's not gonna

work

none of this is gonna work I'm gonna you

know I'm just gonna say I warrington was

doing weird stuff in his room we should

go look in his room and maybe that will

help maybe we can find out what is going

on here because now there's ghosts in

the house and maybe they're hippo people

ghosts coming to haunt me because I

killed one of their brother and who

knows

I like that initiative why don't we go

and take a look and see if maybe he was

hiding something that turned him into a

mind flayer just randomly for no reason

no I know it's not randomly I mean they

definitely implant slugs in people's

brain I know that they do do that all

right

checking to make my way up the stairs

dr. you feel something or someone

grabbed you by the throat oh I would

like you to make a strength athletics

check okay okay so straight on you see

the doctor who's kind of will you here

first the doctor kind of gasp gasps why

do and then when you turn to look at her

she is off her feet in the air and being

thrust up against the wall of the

staircase and there's clearly something

around her neck cuz you can see her

throat is all sort of pressed in and

she's gagging for breath as she's being

held off her feet against the wall on

first I'm like is this a heart attack

looks like

and her little bit her little bag drops

onto the steps as she as she reaches for

whatever force is trying to grab her but

as she's reaching there's nothing there

okay well I think this is a ghost so I'm

gonna go ahead and cast spirit Guardians

around me and then my chickens are going

to appear okay and I'm just gonna say hi

chickens I think we have ghosts okay if

you like can you check if there's ghosts

chickens okay you see how many chickens

do you create you know I don't know I

can actually just unknown number yeah

I'm just gonna cast it at third level

nothing because I'm just having them

look for ghosts it says Guardians

you can designate any number of

creatures you can see to be affected by

it

it doesn't actually actually outline the

number of creatures so no it doesn't

dozens dozens of special chicken support

I like to assume like if it's a battle

she could have like six like a bunch of

big ones for a battle like six big one

but maybe she can summon like a bunch of

tiny regular sized spectral chicken a

run around and search for thanks now

they're close enough being on that

staircase for death and paltin to hear

them the spectral chickens yes yeah

that's fine I'm just like I'm John

someone in the chickens because the

doctor is being choked by a ghost

what'd you just hear that

oh wait a lot babies

I guess the doctors into weird we

should go what come on no you you keep

doing that I'll check on it they just

kind of alright fall behind them but

he'll be sure to take the lantern yes

meanwhile Strix is going in did you know

that we were at the beach earlier today

well I'm like struggling yeah

see think so it's just like we were at

the beach earlier today and it was

really nice and we went for a swim at

the start of your turn doctor fix him

off you take some damage you take a

total of 13 points of damage and it is

your turn what would you like to do okay

and the spectral chickens don't seem to

be reacting to anything on the strength

check you had me wrong I rolled a 15 so

this this is a new strength check you

mate it's the one you had me do before

yes please

okay worse

uh that's a five okay but what would you

like to try to do um can I

I would like to cast command on

whatever's choking me if possible okay

um I don't have my book with me so I'm

not sure if command requires a saving

throw it does and I just have to check

one other thing about the spell

specifically whether or not you have to

see what it is you're commanding it's a

creature you can see within range okay

um why don't we try well if you like to

tag gun needles not gonna do anything in

this house come on what about it what

about calm emotions is that also based

on sight I think that's actually an area

in which case it might be perfect let's

do let's do calm emotions if it's an AoE

yeah it's in it yeah it's a 20-foot

radius sphere so there way to go sounds

great all right and so everybody

including swell

that's not everybody just eats tricks

you have to make a saving throw oh this

is a charisma saving throw I'm good

it'll be great you'll have a great time

you'll be calm no oh that's yeah that's

a lot oh my god that's adding my

charisma bonus right oh yeah

that's 28

okay so your emotions are not calmed by

this though but my bonus keeps me to

always be alright

so as the spell is cast doctor it works

and whatever is holding you releases you

and you just kind of drop down to the

stairs oh she's not having a heart

attack anymore she's yeah I will

pop back up and like smooth myself off

and like I'm fine

well fine we'll well put out that's okay

and then paltin comes in to view this

dark Specter standing at the top top of

the steps since what seems to be the

problem

all these spectral chickens did the

chickens find anything nope oh I'm like

I'm sorry for summoning you you guys I

just apologize to the chickens I heard

there was dr. choking happening and I

came running she's okay but there's

invisible in the house what be

ghosts can't you you do faerie fire cast

some fairy fire around here there's

invisible

did it hurt anybody we care about dr.

that force that you sensed that

intelligence is calm now no I you

believe it will last for up to one

minute great a few constant continued

concentrating on your combinations

alright alright let's play palton the

bat paulsen dark Paulsen Darth can we

can we just go upstair we need to sabor

intend as it was doing something up

there we I need to go look at it because

it's I'm sure that DF is up there

copying a map or something and I need to

go actually yeah

DF comes down right now shining this

light this lantern it's messed up up

there

it's weird you'd okay alright ah

dear should I go look at that I go look

at the stuff up there

around the corner his first thing you'll

probably say is dr. sex him off pop and

see my friends Korea it's very very

unusual for a doctor to make a house

call in the middle of the night I don't

wait wait meant yeah why did you come

here

why are you here at this moment in the

middle of the night after our lovely

beach day in which we then murdered our

friend did your friend get to go on the

beach day yes but we were all mean to

him oh except for except for paltin I

heard he was super nice to him

no you weren't he was super cool to him

they're best friends and palton must be

pretty sad if his best friend is dead oh

he's devastating yeah if Paul T wants to

talk about it I'm just you know just

remembered that his last dying words

were I leave all my guns to you oh

that's so nice that is I'm sorry what

you're doing here I was in the

neighborhood thought of is my friend

strips we have been seeing each other on

more of a regular basis yes she's made

an incredible amount of growth I'm glad

Isis this may not be the best time

things are very dangerous right now and

I'm might be better if you're not here

doctor I I am concerned about concerned

that's our secret fear um your your

friend making me rested is now a mine

flare through a process from this I was

told that he shot himself onto a mind

flayer cannon and now I'm concerned

nobody else you know maybe had a run-in

with mine flares and could also be a

secret my employer or perhaps a me know

any of us could be seeker mind players

Paulson ran into mine flares outside he

could be a secret mind Blair interesting

palton uh we better go ask him about

that

guess we should I would love to hear

about this encounter

with mind flayers outside um I'll get

away I know where he is this is why I

hate it when evil and leaves soap

Alton's room is actually right where you

guys are it's raitis you just kind of

walk thank you for getting him for us

it's really kind of you of course

door opens behind me click okay Oh

Paulsen you're back are you a secret

mind Blair I did I didn't come out yet

yeah Oh God I'm just gonna leave I'm

gonna go upstairs and look at the

upstairs I'm just like I can't I can't

deal with this you stop stop past the F

in his light wait what I know you're

gonna want to but do not touch the black

stuff Oh

noted thank you really bad okay try not

to what about lick it can I lick it

don't don't go anywhere near it

it'll it'll it'll hurt you right in the

brain all right my brains already good

enough in that on its own so I'll make

sure not to touch it all right but

you're making progress

thank you doctor can um I would like to

turn to des and and be like um I don't

want to keep you um I'll leave you guys

are clearly going through some things I

am concerned about the amount of mind

flayers in the area um yeah yeah I am

misterx is clearly very upset and guilty

about her friend she feels like she's

responsible but I feel like she did what

she had to do to protect um everyone in

the house my flares are no joke even if

they were your friends before if you'd

like I can have somebody come and remove

this for you so it's not traumatic

unless you know having dead bodies in

your house is something that you do

often

nonsense I mean I don't I don't judge

I'm never gonna yoke anybody's yeah but

um you hear streets y'all I'm good at

burying bodies I'll take care of it yeah

Warrington was our friend and I think

it's only appropriate that we ourselves

give them a proper burial I think that's

you from after that's incredibly noble

of you

[Music]

da riesen or something my concern is I

don't know a lot about mind flayers but

you don't think perhaps the mind flayers

that your friend paltin ran into are

trying to come and collect him I'm just

saying as a mental professional I have

certain resources you could use for this

why would mind flayers mind players come

and try to collect him from my research

they do appear to be kind of a hive mind

type of deal so maybe they were just

coming to get them I have some notes

here in my bag and I will grab my bag

and just like and pulling out various

bits of research which all looks like

conspiracy theory like Mossman piling it

on where it's like my flares like pies

mind my players kidnapping children out

of schools like I will just start giving

this to him to have and you can keep

these I have plenty of copies I just

don't want to mess around do you know

it's you know way more than you said you

did well I mean you can always learn

more that's for sure I don't want to see

that in the next spurt or anything like

that when you can always a little growth

sure well we don't still think it best

if we deal with the body because if

nothing else maybe some day we were able

to get the funds or the means or

whatever it is maybe someday we can

actually break him back

that's your resurrection spell so I

don't I don't think it'd be a good idea

for us to just

remove him hmm I understand I will take

out one of my business cards and hand it

to DF and I'd be like you call me

anytime the death of a friend is it's

really something else you know well

thank you for inviting me in your lovely

home I will say until you bury a maybe

like role of mine to a piece of plastic

he is leaking from the ceiling there and

I'll go ahead and just uh make my way

downtown as it were

yeah sorry I also heard there were

ghosts yeah but now I'm trying to man

that the ghost cuz they didn't try and

choke me so I'm I'm processing that on

my own I won't make that your problem

yeah but but we have unseen servants but

not straight so Strix is like why was

the ghost choking you could be any

number of reasons I don't remember a

ghost from last time neither do i what

the hell is going on in this place

don't let her leave Strix you walk into

the Warrington's room the old attic

storage room and you can see the black

goo on the walls which is sort of

hardened no I want to lick it yes you do

man but you also see the the maze map on

the floor that he drew and you can see

all the contraptions that he's built out

of everything he could get his hands on

including this strange manikin in the

center of the room with the bunny ears

all right does anything look like what

is the most openly dangerous / magical

looking piece in here well you don't

know what's magical unless you cast not

that magic okay how do I have that now

thanks to my new stick that's a good

question

I'm looking no i'm telekinesis that's

fun I don't think I do

don't dispel magic witch that might work

actually you do have detect magic you

can use that

we'll Wow no charges my new stick

alright cuz I still have my regular

staff as a lantern on my cell

sorry I'll take out my nose my new staff

witch and alright it flares with some

magical runes as it kind of lights up a

little bit and you cast that spell when

you do you can see that there is magic

issuing from the manikin all right and

you can see that part of it has broken

off it's got sort of these it's got new

arms kind of attached to it so they're

kind of sticking out okay kind of weird

angles but it's also got these other

things stuck in it and there's something

lying on the floor that looks like it's

meant to attach into its chest alright I

look I look at that and I'm like well

this looks like some kind of weird space

hippo nonsense that I need to put

together so I'll walk over there and

pick up the piece and stick it inside

the chest manikin when you do the

mannequin immediately so it's on it

doesn't have legs anymore it's serve on

a post that's fixed to a base and it

starts to spin around on that post like

a some sort of crazy ballerina okay not

not liking this and as it does energy

begins to flash over its metal parts and

between its bunny ears and a portal

opens up in the room and

paltin DF you hear this

sound oh I'm upstairs you've heard that

sound before I'm sure and then this kind

of oh is this loud enough to wake me up

because I just went to see you you just

nodded off and now you are awakened by

this strange sound this whomp whomp

sound after hearing that I'm gonna look

to dr. specs I'm off just be like sorry

I really have to go check out something

you run upstairs like a lantern yeah the

door is like his straud slippers in row

this is like why is it so loud in this

damn house Simon is missing it's like

this is what evil exactly halten when

you come out you say that the only one

here to hear you is dr. FX them off

she's that why are you still here I was

told to wait well you're being told not

to wait you know well you have a

wonderful night

I love those slippers those are dressed

the cutest oh it's so good like they're

they make me nostalgic right that's so

sweet

well did you know you were Batman fringe

then I hope he has a fine time fight you

crime and I will pick up my back and to

leave the house okay

so doctor you make your way down stairs

past the corpse of Warrington Mundt and

through into another chamber which has

the spiral staircase leading down you

see once you're back down in the tap

room that Alby the albino beholder

baseball creature is there it didn't

really do any of the cleaning that it

was asked to James it tried to sort of

stop the blood by kind of positioning

itself underneath it so wouldn't fall in

the stool but now it's just covered with

mind flayer blood

I would like to take another

handkerchief and dab at his little like

and put it back in my bag and then I

will go to my waiting coach it this

behold I think kind of follows you oh no

don't take Alby I won't take him as like

it's like somebody's dog that's like

really excited I'll like gently like

kind of push it away as I try and like

close the door all right

it it it really wants to go with you but

you kind of pull the door shut but then

I need you to make a strength check to

oppose its telekinetic um I actually

just make a strength saving throw okay

seventeen that's that's strong enough

that you can force the door closed until

it latches and head to your cart then as

you're climbing into the cart with the

help of the driver because the steps are

kind of big for your little body you see

through the dark window of the taproom

the beholder to sort of pressed up

against it looking at you like a dog

very very sad immense eyes get big I

will be emotionally traumatized by at

least two hours and then instead of

going home I'm gonna go back to the

asylum okay you give the driver

directions head back to the mister arms

mister his arms and so it clatters off

and though even those of you in the in

the bowels of the house can hear the

sound of a coach outside

clattering away strix when death when

you get upstairs there's no sign of

strix

and you can just see the mannequin kind

of slowing down it's spinning

and there's like a little flash of light

from between the bunny ears and it goes

dark the very first thing I do is call

out for Strix Strix you are in the room

but there's no residue on the walls okay

and even though it's the same room it

seems to be in a different time or place

because there are large parts of the

wall walls that are just missing and all

the glass is broken out so there are

these gaps and slaps into the night now

you would be able to see out through

these gaps except for the fact that

there are big thick webs okay outside I

know I know where well I know what this

is and caught in the webs you can see

what appeared to be birds that have

flown into them and become trapped okay

there's no sign of the contraption or

any of other any of Warrington's other

paraphernalia in the room okay I know

this place I've been here haven't I oh I

will Arcana check but I think I've been

here that's 14 what do you think this

room is this is the shadow fell hard to

say but it does sort of remind you of

that and the place seems to be has not

this room has not been lived in in a

long time yeah okay okay there is still

a door however leading out into the

hallway across from which what would be

DS room okay I'm gonna go to that door

okay just telling myself I'm just going

okay can't get out can always get out

gonna get out and have my new stick I

have my old stick have things just

defend myself anything you hear your

name no it was just a bunny it was just

a bunny man I can't

it seems so innocuous okay and where is

it coming from somewhere okay okay I

just stand I just hold I don't stand up

straight and I look out into the room

and I say yes what do you want I'm here

I'm probably stuck here again for a

million years what do you want

d/f you get no response am i up in the

room at this point yes Hayward's tricks

go she's she's gone right now

so what I'm like when I came in here I

noticed like the mannequin was moving

and doing stuff it was spitting around

very slowly coming to a stop and there

was just a flash between its bunny ears

signaling that whatever it did or

whatever happened it stopped now in a

precursor II glanced around the room I

see no other notable changes there some

of things have been moved around a

little bit pushed but maybe by some sort

of energy or force and a few papers seem

to be missing or they were blown away

somewhere yeah you can also see what

appears to be a dead bird on the floor

that wasn't there before

what kind of bird was it it's a

desiccated sparrow it looks like it's

been dead for a long time do you what

kind of like did a thing he's gonna like

step over a lot of stuff on the floor

yeah closer to the mannequins inspected

further he doesn't even really know what

he's looking for he's just okay make a

perception check and palton you're there

- okay

it depends what do you and what do you

want to do you see deaths obviously

looking around this mannequin do I feel

anything familiar no not at the moment

reception is 21 you see that near the

base of the mannequin is a small piece

of metal that looks like it fell off it

became detached

okay and I don't remember those I don't

know if this was on the mannequin before

or not you don't remember seeing it on

the mannequin before but you can see

with your roll where it's supposed to be

in the chest of the mannequin okay it's

this sort of u-shaped piece of wire that

sort of plugs in almost like into an

outlet but listen to it D if they're

just going to turn back to paltin just

be like do you do

know what this is do you know anything

do I see that it looks like you would

fit in there mm-hmm

okay just like if I try to take it from

D F is he gonna like let it go

probably yes just like oh yeah he's

looking at it for inspection purposes Oh

clearly that goes in there quick all

right

strix what do you do when you get no

reply to your query um I mean I'm

looking there's a door mm-hmm so I may

be out leading out to the hallway that

goes downstairs okay

so I'm not I don't know what's here so

I'm just going to very gently just peek

through the door okay I don't want to

like go through the door I just want to

like okay this hallway has a gaping hole

in the roof and again there seem to be

more webs strung around the outside of

the structure but they staircase leading

down to the third floor you can see is

in very poor condition but is basically

still intact okay the wooden staircase

has become warped by time and elements

deaths bedroom door is not entirely

closed but you can hear nothing coming

from beyond it and you can just sort of

smell kind of that smell of bird poop

and neglect and time passing right

I will I'm just gonna I'm gonna go ahead

and make make myself well no I'm not

gonna do that I'm just I'm gonna turn

myself into a cloud all right yeah

you're a gaseous Rick's and I'm gonna

kind of float down the hallway so that I

don't get it around any of the dangerous

falling bits

okay and just sort of peek in the rooms

all right as you make your way down the

hallway you hear a woosh sound behind

you back from the room you came no and

there's a blast of air that sort of

passes through your gaseous body down

the staircase from that room oh I'm

definitely gonna look back to that so

I'll turn around and look when you turn

around and you peer back into the room

you see death and paltin standing there

you know you just see their backs and

it's just like I don't think that did

anything and suddenly death inform you

instantly see you're been transformed to

another space oh yes trixl immediately

go back in there and turn back into

herself and be like oh you made it and

we got streaks back and also it

completely changed the same room we're

still in after turning around and seeing

Strix their idea that mmediately is just

like Strix in like kind of runs up to

her and almost kind of like stops

himself in her in her gaseous form she's

there's nothing to really hold on she

turned back oh yes he kind of like stops

himself before he got too close and just

like she hugs what happened

she doesn't stop him she hugs her

immediately oh and then he'll just kind

of be like what happened it's a portal I

think we're in the shadow fell Oh again

and I don't know what do you think

Pompton you take a closer look this

place likes you better

does it feel like it likes me better

[Laughter]

make an insight check paltin

dirty 20 okay this feels a little

different but you can't explain exactly

how but on some meta level you paltin

realize that this is if nothing else a

Evert you are in a version of Waterdeep

that is different from the one you came

from a coexistent Waterdeep all right

this feels exactly the same and I can

explain everything so there yeah we are

in not a deep shadow deep fire and

shallow and it is it is the right side

up and of water would you say perhaps a

different dimension yeah I mean that's

my guess

yes you would that's totally what I was

gonna say but then you beat me to it

sorry I didn't mean to take that away

from you no it's okay I already knew

that

yeah I wouldn't have known that without

do exactly that's this might be where

everyone is like I don't know if this if

there's invisible things they might have

come from here

well a big ass spider not ten like about

ten feet across crawls on the outside of

the web up toward the roof paying no

mind to you at all

okay okay doesn't want us doesn't

doesn't want us doesn't all right

look last we heard we went to the

black's f tower isn't it possible of

that this is what Audra and L was

mucking around with that's right I

wonder if we yell our name shall come

see us I don't know if we should kill ya

we straight

go straight to the library all the

library that's right it's one so it's

right below you one floor down I can

help us get there I can use my pass wall

you totally could all right

I'm gonna use my new stick and and wow

this is this a plan this is really proud

of us can we just can we get like a

group high-five or something I learned

that in therapy so you you burned you

burned the charges and then you tap the

staff on the ground opening a hole in

the floor that you can see as the

library below you and through that hole

you see the kids there okay okay yeah

they're they're all huddled around in

the library and this library by the way

does not look like yours it looks lived

in there are books on the shelves

there's all kinds of paraphernalia about

this is somebody's workspace and they

the kids are not alone you see that they

have lying on the floor next to them

another kid and you recognize this other

kid as the young boy to whom evil and

gave juniper oh this is the young boy

also that Simon locked in a chest oh

yeah

turret the young boys name probably

escapes you at the moment but he is

lying unconscious on the floor

Simon's standing on the desk nearby with

a wooden slat oh his hand that's I just

look at paltin I'm like that's not my

problem

my sons already conquered the shadow

fell and when the kids see that you in

the the hole in the ceiling the magical

hole that's formed temporarily NAT will

wave Simon will drop he'll actually sort

of tried to hide the piece of wood kind

of kick it off the end of the desk yeah

jinx is just gonna you know there's no

pies here hey guys

and Simon will say we're prisoners Oh

God what like emotionally or literally

here um and he says Oh a wizard

she's holding us here just a small open

oh I just did just stay it's open it's

just there it is yeah

hang on kids we're getting you out of

there India to like hop down into that

room okay you land like a cat yeah

Alton kind of stumbles through the hole

and Circus falls and hits the ground the

kids will tell you that this this young

boy works with the Wizards with the

wizard sorry works yeah and so their

plan was to knock him out and trade him

trade his release for their release the

kids you can't you can't be manipulating

people like that and these are

assignment we're gonna have a long talk

about this so this young boy who's lying

unconscious on the floor just got conked

over the head not too long ago and the

kids were talking about you can see that

he is he looks like the boy you had met

earlier but the way he's dressed

very kind of dirty stained his brown

hair is even longer and you can see he's

sort of sallow and malnourished oh

alright let's let's get them out of here

let's take the kid and like put him back

up into the room above all right that's

how we got in maybe that's the same way

we can get out you know I can there's a

ladder that you can detach from the

shelves one of those Rolly little

sliding ladder things to help get them

get back up because it's like a 10-5

climb out of here yes so we'll do that

but DF also what kind of stayed in your

the ladder and like kind of like waste

each kid up is like yeah that's it going

up top make sure they're okay okay yeah

and they'll tell you that this is the

wizard study and they don't know who she

is but she is just crazy all right we're

getting them out of here okay we'll put

the ladder up and I can't actually

dispel the pass wall so he can get them

upstairs in the in the other room but

there's that giant spider that's really

bad I don't think we should I think we

should go with them does anyone else

wanna move this wizard well we'll meet

the wizard but not with the kids Oh

truth yeah let's just hold on do you

wants to investigate the out of

this room okay as much as you can yeah

you can see that the shelves are packed

with all sorts of books that have been

gathered from who knows where it's a

mishmash collection though yeah and go

through that to the desk has a lectern

beside it that has an open spell book on

it and there are some other books piled

on the desk as well as some melting

candles that Simon's sort of

accidentally kicked over you can see

that there's a a birdcage that doesn't

have any birds in it at the moment but

you can see there's a small pillow in

the cage and they will tell you that

that's where the boy apparently was

living no no this person's this person's

barmy hmm can I look at them what the

spell book is open to it is open to not

surprisingly a spell but one you are not

familiar with and when you look at the

book and all the notes around it you can

see that this spell book has the spells

have been transcribed in one hand of

course and there's a whole bunch of

annotations and things and just some

crazy ass drawings oh this is this is a

mind that doesn't think like normal

minds mmm as you sort of flipped through

there is a drawing that shows somebody

who's got like something impaled through

them and written above it is the name

all Coria

oh no oh no oh no this is the enemy of

Oh No No

what did she do to her euro knowing a

lot and I have very little context

listen o the Oracle Korea was the one

who helped us who helped us open the

bakery she's the one who was like my

wizard patron who I thought was my

friend she's the one who helped turn

Simon into a real boy

she turned Simon yes there's a good

context that paltin wouldn't know yes

she turned Simon into a real boy not

that she's been to her house a million

it's fine and as you recall she's the

one who sold the house she owned the

house before Magnus did I think I don't

think she's a nice person I think she

trapped whoever this this person is here

maybe they can help us maybe they it

seems like they've gone insane being

here but they might not be bad how do we

know we don't have this backwards maybe

she got herself stuck here I mean we'd

heard about from the black staff they

even said that she worked with

dimensional magic and was already

rejected by that's true that's true yes

maybe she's misunderstood well maybe

she's just bad then I don't know I think

we should get out of here

the boy is waking up yeah did I just

like okay I'll give him one of my little

good Barry hand pies okay so you

splashed something on him to wake him up

after paltin just Congress him on the

head yeah and I just can't identify when

you do he just devours it okay dude

little guy

what's going on here so in a moment I'm

going to turn this character over to

Jared but this is what this young man

says and he tells you that he has been a

prisoner here for a long time he lived

with his family in the town

his family was killed murdered as as for

being for harboring and sheltering

Harper's oh he and his sister were able

to flee and survive but they became

separated and that's what he was caught

by Audra and brought back here to

basically be a servant okay not nice

Audra not nice Audra rug Audra this is

Audra the rug Audra the one who'd sent

the rug yeah yeah she did have the kid

tells you that she did order a rug yeah

with her dimensional magic this is where

she's been perhaps he'd been trapped who

knows and water Dean's Strix will like

kneel down to the kid and be like do you

know where she could be right now oh she

says she's in the house she she felt

some weird presence across dimensions

and she went to confront it because it

was somebody she knew that's unfortunate

there's something there's something else

that you know Martin and that is that

this that the water deep that he lives

in is ruled by worshippers of Chartres

the goddess of shadow and night oh no

and the three rulers the three rulers of

the city are a death knight named van

rack moon star a shadow dragon named um

Brack Sekar and Evelyn of Chartres oh no

guys guys can we stay here so no we're

not staying here

oh here don't you remember that you know

I do and it was so cool it was not cool

it was incredible

everyone's in danger right here right

now we got to get everyone out of here

yes we need to leave immediately we need

to meet this wizard

no can do I have a spell to make you

pass out it's okay she's probably not

even that strong all right that's why

she was do we know if waffles is here

I'm gonna turn to turn to Simon Simon

his waffles here's what awful smack

buzzes upstairs now he's saying uh she

didn't come with us okay all right

waffles back the house we didn't check

she was min asleep she sleeps a lot

uh-huh it's like a cat all right waffles

isn't here we just need to get the kids

out of here we all need to stay together

so let's all go upstairs yes what was

your name again

what is my name Martin Martin yeah and

or an mm ma are TEM last name trek TR

emergency mark time okay Martin two ends

all right yes with us yes yes said we

have plenty we need we always need more

mouths to feed

yeah don't worry you'll get your no you

won't get your own room that's a lie

you'll get to live with three other

wonderful children let's go Martin you

know that there's the if they're going

to try to escape this place they're

probably going to need art Audra spell

book I look at the spell book I'm like

you know what I want that anyway and I

was like I'm not a wizard but I'm taking

it anyway Strix definitely take it if

nothing else we could probably learn

quite a bit from it that's true also I

like books even though no one ever gets

them for me in our library is empty so I

shouldn't assume this do you all climb

up this up the ladder to get back into

the room that was the attic room because

as I understand it Paul Tain's really

got it you know a bee in his bonnet

about finding this Audra no yes we need

to agree paltin and we need to find

Audra but we need to keep the kids safe

so my idea

and hear me out there's four of them it

might be a bit of a waste of my magic

but I have my new stick but we can turn

them all into clouds and put them in

various vessels on our body great one

thing I also agree it's paltin that we

do need to find all chodri but it should

also be when we had the advantage and we

don't right now not while the kids are

here and not while we're in her home

turf that's true

kid but vessels but if she's a powerful

wizard I'd a and she's not here right

now maybe we can like sabotage her stuff

maybe we can poison her or something is

there anything I can poison okay that li

hao's the thing she uses to get back

between this dimension in our own yeah

what would she use do I see anything she

would use possibly the book in your hand

but as you look around maybe quickly

search her desk for things you can find

all kinds of paraphernalia she she has

gathered so much stuff there's talismans

there's bird claw things there's there's

what looks like a tuning fork that you

pull out oh that's interesting okay

that's and you think this may be some

sort of component for a high level

magical spell possibly even a plane

shift spell great I have that spell on

my staff complaint shift we can leave I

have that spell that's good that's what

she's been using mm-hmm so it would seem

and we need to get out of here I okay

and I have I have oh I know okay

okay I have I use our member of the

panic spell that I use to get us back

the it takes us back to the panic room

when we leave places all together and we

panic together and leave I have I have a

it's a the circle on the ground the

symbols I draw I can use plane shift to

get us to go back there okay hey what I

would still like to just look around and

get a feel for the place you know like

see if I like vibe with it it's just it

seems really interesting we can come

back we can come back

I'm sure evil and we'll want to come

back when she hears that Evelyn of

Chartres is here we can come back but

the kids need to go back to the house we

have to take them back okay you take

them back we can leave you here if you

want but we have to take the kids back

that's such a horrible idea it happened

we can't just be Moulton here

now with that attitude no I'm not gonna

leave you here evil would never forgive

us that's true she wouldn't and she

would never forgive you

that's also true okay I mean look can we

go back to the dark paulson because i

feel like dog dark palton was a little

bit more like easy to work with

[Laughter]

no ok I'm gonna cast plain shift we're

gonna leave all right so just so you

know you and up to eight willing

creatures who linked hands in a circle

are transported by the spell there's you

there's DF okay they're all five kids

including Simon and Markham

damn it and you have to leave Paul to

Alton dammit

huh so you DF paulten five kids is eight

okay yeah okay alright paulsen we're all

holding okay everyone get to circle it's

like when you're in like school and they

tell you getting this bike and you're

gonna like get a circle can't just leave

you behind

no we're not leaving anyone behind

paltin get to hold we're holding hands

we're all holding hands in a circle

Chris I don't feel like I'd be able to

like do any shifting with uh with any

borough vien avestan e shenanigans do i

shifting like like Peter travel

yeah so your vast Ani heritage allows

you to walk through the mists without

dying so you can even come and go from a

Ravenloft domain where no one else can

but that's the limit where we are well

you may be this may be the shadow fell

but you haven't seen enough to really

know for sure

certainly Chartres is a being who would

be strongly inclined to pull a city into

the shadow fell if she could okay I'll

go with okay for now thank you let me

here's the thing paltin we can come back

here

whatever Warrington made or whatever

that thing is or why it's there we can

use it again and I can get us out again

but we need to get the kids back home it

has her spell book I mean she's not

going anywhere it's true she's stuck she

also probably has her her plane shifting

tunings I had the tuning fork yeah

alright so so okay

we'll grab a sandwich I'll get my aunt

evylyn yeah well obviously it'll get

also get my cloak and then I'll be much

more ready for this place you're right I

am ill-equipped I am just in a robe you

don't even have strap on chair

you're in slippers okay all right right

in that case you activate the staff you

cast the spell and because you're all

holding hands you all disappear to your

panic room on your own plane as you I

think wow I just like fall to the ground

and like hug some garbage that's left

there once I go I'm so happy to be back

and right outside the door of course is

the bled out carcass of Warrington month

Wow when the kids see it they all scream

no no no no no no no stay here no

actually let us resolve the Warrington

month a situation in the last few

minutes we have squigglies just like

poking it yeah strikes is gonna be like

no no no we we have to I'm good at

burying people the sesame I this has to

be my doing

it always is who was that oh my god

I'm gonna use my now forever quickly I'm

not I am NOT your mom well then I'm not

paltin and D if I need your help please

of course tricks you got it I'll use

telekinesis to float him out front the

mouse okay that's got a wherever it's in

the dead of night

absolutely the dead of night there's not

really any grass in water deep there's

just cobbles and dirt and so well well

good thing good thing is that I'm

currently using telekinesis which I

think lasts for ten minutes yeah so I

can go outside float him down there lift

the lift the cobbles up lift the dirt up

okay they moved aside this also looks

very dramatic because she's gonna lift

lift up the before she would amuse her

but she now she your staff does it for

her so all these all these cobbles come

rising up off the ground and just kind

of float in the air until enough dirt is

cleared away to create a cavity and this

is all happening under this moonless on

sorry this moonlit sky in troll skull

alley when everybody else appears to be

asleep I'm sure there's one neighbor

watching us who just watches us like a

bad reality television show but that's

fine there is in fact one I can't think

of at least one

yeah and social move his body down into

the grave and you know probably I'd like

she tells Paulson to go get hit one of

his favorite guns he doesn't have one

apparently okay well go get something

that was his that he liked did he do you

know anything that he liked I will see

what I can do

I'll go over I'll go up to Warrington's

room if there's anything left of the

carnage you can see that there's a black

box with like a button on it and some

wires kind of extruding out of it and

disappearing into the corners of the

room what this described said button

it's big and red God thinking like I

should have said I should have sent to

you I'm gonna put a pin in that do I

find um any muskets

sadly you only find pieces of muskets

because he disassembled his weapons to

make all kinds of other contraptions

which is heartbreaking okay you know

what let's just not decide for ourselves

okay I'm going to walk to the first

floor

yeah and then I'm going to cast mislead

okay and I would like for my like clone

can my clone go up there and press the

button that is a good question

I have this really nice thing that we're

gonna do so it just does not come back

quickly yes cause now it's like still

looking couple good options just want to

make sure it's the right one okay all

right chill just like continue to pour

put the dirt over it since it's clearly

just described as an illusion I'm gonna

say it can't really manipulate anything

okay so I'm gonna go ahead

what is there is there anything like

literally anything small in the room

there's all kinds of small stuff there's

a there's a charcoal pencil that he was

using to draw all his crazy stuff in his

formulae there's that hello there's the

the blueprints for the turret cannon

okay so I'm gonna animate object on the

pencil okay and I'm gonna place it next

to the button and then walk downstairs

and then command it to press the button

okay while that's going on strix what

would you like to do asserts immediately

realizes that she should not have even

told Paulson to leave and that in the

future she won't do that

so she said settlement before I guess

before she buried him she took his

medals off yes and so she's just going

to like lay out a piece of cloth and the

medals she wanted to get a rifle to put

like a sash on that's what but because

nothing goes right in her life or any of

the people around her she just has a

dirty piece of her robe on the ground on

top of the rate the grave with her

medals threat with the medals thrown on

it and so she's just gonna sit there and

just walk backwards and just say to do

thank you if there's anything you want

to say and we weren't very nice to him

but I just really really quick I

actually want to just what I said I

actually want to wait until I'm like out

there of course and so Walton does come

back out uh-huh that guy's alright and

they're very strict is very somber she's

just like if you want to say anything

it's it's all of our fault that he died

it's our fault that everyone dies around

us and we're only on borrowed time from

the gods we're here only as long as we

can be because eventually our tricks are

going to stop working and all of our

attempts at living are going to stop

working and eventually we're going to be

just like Warrington and

be able to be brought back and then it's

up to them it's up to what happens

and whatever plane and whatever petition

we end up trying but we have to care

about each other

because we don't have enough time

everyone's out here right the kids

aren't out there it's just the three of

you Oh guys I forgot to uh I forgot to

actually get the thing from Warrington's

room I'll be back one more time you come

up with the kids know much and you know

their drinks there's like mad about that

she's like paltin the kids shouldn't see

this he's buried but I saw this growing

up no no one needs to see what I saw

no one needs to see this no one needs to

see everyone dying around them it's not

fair so holy

you want a Simon's like this is actually

pretty tame no one even realizes that

but you're a grown you're a grown adult

don't pull that on me Simon so you

want to teach these kids that these

things that are very real and a big part

of life just don't exist I just don't

want them to end up like me you hear a

voice from somewhere else all you will

you please shut up go to sleep that's it

I'm done goodbye I tried to be nice I

tried to do something nice for our

friend who's dead

and there's nothing we can do that's

when the top of the house explodes so

you see a great plume of orange flame

engulf the attic storage room deaths

bedroom and the top of the turret and

everything just the whole top of the

house

just goes up like a roman candle blasted

to smithereens and you're standing there

over Warrington's grave as Flinders

rained down up

Hanyu embers burning papers and wood and

other paraphernalia and you can't

imagine in that moment a more glorious

gif send-off hystrix actually says that

she's like well this is what he would

have wanted yeah I think it is dr. thexa

moth when you get back to your office

the first thing you want to do is check

into your files to find that individual

and you do find a big file on Audra nel

and suddenly it all comes back to you

all of the damage all of the distress

you didn't hold much hope that she would

be able to weather the storm of what she

perceived to be all of her enemies

around her but you can crack the file

open and see refresh your mind okay I

will go through the file and it's

probably thicker than Strix is file I'm

assuming yeah yeah if I could do like

it's in volumes right here's here's a

woman who went up through the you know

the wizard Li the wizard Li Wei tried to

become a member of the arcane

Brotherhood was turned down and then

proceeded to a spiraling life a descent

offending all the wrong people making

all the wrong enemies and getting

herself deeper and deeper into this

maelstrom of trouble your your

assistance upon learning that you've

returned to come just to check up on you

make sure all right you see there are

now four of them I will see that there

are four of them and I'd like to imagine

that like I make new ones we're like a

fun hat or something like so I know

they're new because they look the same

really there's not much a distinguish

them they kind of do but like one of

them worries like one of those hats that

like new Google employees where that has

like a little like propeller on top of

it it's very charming I will greet my my

new my new intern and I will I'll set my

very cute I will bear wicker bag on my

desk

and say well that didn't go as expected

um but I kind of expected it to not go

as expected so I'm not too terribly

upset I think we're gonna have our work

cut out for us or sure who's not able to

get the body but I guess and it sounds a

little bleak try not to judge probably

gonna have to dig it up done it before

it's not I am but we do what we need to

do I did have a bit of a run-in with a

previous patient so I'm gonna go ahead

and take a peek at these notes here come

up with a plan

and I think let's see 4c I think for

this particular patient she would be a

good candidate for sure if we can get to

her and we'll have our work cut out for

us for sure but I see something greater

for her that thing we talked about in

the hall Hands meeting the other day

your renewal filly went but it has

something to do with with what we found

in under mountain and that's where we'll

stop this has been horrible it's pretty

cool huh this is the one who's giving us

trust issues yeah that's great that's

great Thank You hadeel thank you so so

much for joining us this was too much

fun it was amazing and obviously

obviously more fun to be had yeah yes
