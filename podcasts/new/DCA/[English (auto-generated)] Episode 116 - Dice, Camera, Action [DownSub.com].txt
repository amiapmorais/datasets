yes yes we might hello everybody welcome

to dice camera action we're a D&D show

where we play D&D for almost two

straight hours and nothing bad ever

happens

and everybody lose happy wait a minute

that's somebody else's show the beach

episode right yes yeah there's another

show there's a parallel universe dice

camera action out there where

everybody's happy joyous and playing on

the beach most of the time you know we

called that show boring boring yeah it

sounds lame drama int also I want to be

there so previously in dice camera

action the waffle crew were invited by

lady s valet Rosner to a peaceful

gathering at house Marg Astor which

turned into a debacle

when straud von czarevitch and a pair of

vampire hunter brothers showed up and

inspired the waffle crew to partake in

shenanigans not our fault

yeah inspired yes

so this peaceful gathering at house Marg

aster turned to shambles when all hell

broke loose and the waffle crew ended up

dispatching the vampire lord in

fantastic fashion and ending ending with

evil and Martha in casting her radiant

version of Moonbeam upon the gaseous

vampire and effectively obliterating him

in morning light get rekt yep

then the City Guard showed up because

there wasn't supposed to be any violence

at this festival gathering but Strix had

her word of recall handy and big zapped

everybody safely back to the waffle

house

you take that coppers yes I heard

probably so the waffle house is a

charming multi-level estate in one of

the better districts of the city and the

waffle crew has had it renovated

extensively and turned into a bakery of

sorts there's also a large supply of

wine tucked away in the cellars to keep

one paltin SEPA happy in addition to the

waffle crew they have a albear named

waffles and they have a retinue a

coterie of street urchins three to be

exact and they have an albino beholder

kin named Albie and they have a little

wooden man named Simon and they have a

severed hand named Han drew under this

roof lives this extended family and as

you return there's the usual cavalcade

of chaos that ensues whenever the adults

are gone for any length of time

so you BAM into the Waffle House and

then you just sort of here screaming

yelling floorboards creaking under the

weight of a rampaging al bear and

occasional hisses of a small beholder Oh

also hi to all be first I feel like it

I'll be cheesy it's like really needy

mm-hmm you know let's give them some

scratches all right and as we've

established through fan lore I'll be now

has a little witch hat yes yeah yes a

little stone witch hat so yeah I'll give

them some scratches and say I look I eat

so cute and then say hi to waffles who I

assume that waffles like says hi like a

really excited dog I don't know building

like me stomping yeah yes exactly

yeah so I'll probably like it stepped on

and you'll hear some like screams like

oh yeah

also you've noticed over the past a

couple weeks that waffles is actually

put on a lot of weight so as she's as

she stomps around it does sort of create

its own little thunder

well you operate a bakery so it only

makes sense right yeah she's been eating

the flakes tricks is just like what has

she been eating I don't know I haven't

given her pots just pies do you have any

business that you want to attend to

knowing that you've just left house Marg

aster in complete and utter disarray

the very first thing death does is

change out of the awful garbage days

we're in town he like he is so

uncomfortable in his fancy clothes which

is why the bottom half of them was his

normal outfit and all he threw around

was a nice shirt and basically a blazer

on top I thought that's what made

someone look noble and he hated it so

he's merely just gonna go and like

change back and tuck his normal clothes

just like get off okay as you're

discarding your stuff and and changing

out it's still kind of dark and stormy

out and the fog is still pretty thick in

the air outside but DFU do notice that

that stuffing lists straw doll skin

mister shamble faces remains are still

in your possession probably just sort of

tucked on a little hook behind your bed

do we know about it now did you tell us

or no I think I kind of did yeah okay

it's just now just sort of a kind of

like a sad memento of the

shenanigans yeah all right can we put it

up in the in just like it was a nail

like a spike like we did it yes that

sounds awesome all right we're about so

you're going to like shots you're gonna

like put it like just I'm like the the

main in the main room just up on a wall

yeah okay yeah just with like a little

tiny like a nail that looks like a stake

through the heart like right in the

middle got it perfect yeah all right so

the straw doll is now impaled on the

wall of the Waffle House mm-hmm a

vegetable get a little gypsy home sign

right next to it

Lysander yes I like that but something

still ever does up like no vampires in

this home and greater no vampires like

on oh you know what she's gonna write to

Rosie and ask for an embroidered sign

that says no vampire watches all this

kind of thoughtfully like

uncharacteristically quietly and she

she's kind of getting all sappy like she

keeps trying to like hug her friends as

she looks at this and she's like it

almost seemed impossible didn't it but

but we're stronger now and we did it

yeah like you know like we never thought

we could defeat Strad cuz you he seemed

like such a big bad guy it seemed

impossible and he he made such a fool of

us before but then we just kept trying

and kept trying and and then we did it

is he really dead I don't think so

probably not but I mean does it matter

that we did that anyway it absolutely

matters for if he ever shows his face

again it means that we absolutely know

that you can handle them between you and

paltin we can handle him well and you

guys it's not like it's not like we

would be able to do what we did without

you yeah it's true

yeah d/f I hit a rat with a stick

but I never would have been able to talk

to everyone there in the way that you

did they'd get to get us there and you

talked to Stroud and made him be how he

was you know how I am I just running and

stabby stabby and I can stab stab real

good but I can't I can't plan the way

you did those yeah and all I did was

ruin an entire room with a fireball

which is considered property damage

which I'm pretty sure is against the law

well yeah we all contributed I assume at

some point I serve at some point evylyn

you put your sword out yeah but but not

before kind of being like like waving it

around a little bit

haha okay oh great keep the keep the

nice coat eyes like um I'm kind of

feeling myself in there something yeah

you do look really nice okay thank you

thank you you all looked wonderful and

still do Strix has sent her dress on

fire and has just burned it off it's

just gone well you haven't like had you

know sister type figures in your life

very long but like typically if someone

loans you a dress you don't set it on

fire I don't understand

um so like you understand borrowing like

when you have something but then you

give it back to the person like

sometimes a person lets you use

something that isn't yours so you eat it

so it's like you eat a pie and when you

throw up it up in your hands and then

give it back kind of except well dresses

aren't typically considered consumables

Oh see that's where I got confused I'm

so you know it's not like a one-time

thing so like next time alone you like a

very expensive gown that I love like

maybe don't like set it on fire

okay I'm sorry she's like feeling kind

of bad sorry I make you a new one

okay you make pretty things alright I'll

make your new one I'll make a new one do

you want it made out of

for spiderwebs or maybe just like hold

off for now while I think about it all

right

spiderweb sounds cool actually yes

spiderwebs she's like taking notes like

Mets make evil and a spiderweb dress to

make her stealing and burning her things

okay thank you but she's still Strix

Dilla's her hair up like it's still like

up with a little feather in it that she

leaves her hair like that for a while

you all right the the peals of thunder

become more infrequent and seemed to

fade away over the course of the night

and even the fog by morning is mostly

gone good

yeah unless you unless you feel

differently I'm gonna say yes

I think Evelyn is so excited by the

events of the day that she maybe has a

tough time falling asleep she does the

kind of like hands clap clasp on chest

stare at the ceiling or the canopy of

her canopy bed like just can't quite

grasp what happened that day

well you're well you're sort of

wrestling with that evil and you're also

just sort of sort of mentally

calendaring where you are in the month

and deciding that you probably should

pay a visit to your temple mmm

just you know putting in your regular

appearance and attending Mass okay she

makes a note to ask the crew if they

want to come with her tomorrow where is

where it can I can I like hang with

Andrew for a bit absolutely okay so I'm

hanging with Andrew I'm just like all

right man I need you I need you to learn

something for me this is very important

anything take out the gun all right so

oh my god

this like I don't know how well we're

gonna make this work all right

this election day 28 we teach a magical

hand child Simon so that's it

no but I had I don't trust it with Simon

at the moment but I trust I trust

hand-drew with this for some reason now

I do I feel like I could teach it how to

use it so had Andrew by his very nature

is one-handed he could be he gonna hold

it but then you know he's now holding it

and can't you know he has no fingers

left or maybe he has one if he you know

did he not like prop himself up on his

on his I could absolutely he could so he

could definitely do that and probably

get a shot off in whatever direction

it's so wanted what he might have

trouble doing is like reloading it so do

what you want to want to see how he how

he fares maybe oh maybe if I hold him

and it well then why wouldn't I just do

it it'd be way more interesting

oh okay alright yeah yeah alright where

Simon I'm gonna have Simon reloaded and

together they will operate a gun you're

not suited Simon but you can load it no

I won't even had a shooting he will only

load it and he definitely won't try to

shoot it because I didn't teach him how

all right do me a favor palton and just

make a dexterity saving throw oh great

22 okay

the the the first time the shot goes off

it basically nearly takes your ear off

that's kind of like a boy okay we

definitely heard that

yes oh I also forgot one important

individual who has also been staying at

the Waffle House Oh God a gift named

Warrington monk no he heard that as the

weapon discharges in the wee hours of

the night

all of you are those of you who are

asleep are awakened with a start and you

hear oh by Jove oh it's like oh no hide

it hide it hide the gun I think hide the

gun now to get under a bed and as soon

as the rest of you show up in Paulson's

room everybody is just sort of

conspicuously posed what was that

thunder oh you heard that too I'm pretty

sure the whole street heard that oh yeah

that was the result of a flintlock

pistol oh yeah what's what is that

please share with the class you've been

into my gunpowder

what is this little cloud this is our

hanging over pollens head look if it's

under this roof it is our gunpowder not

that I was in it

Warrington monk sort of looks around

adjusts his monocle goes up to the wall

and sees a hole in it right next to the

Wardrobe haha I like slowly slide in

front of the hole

[Laughter]

when what what what was it you called it

it is a flintlock pistol interesting is

that some kind of not gun evylyn like

leans over to death and she's like what

are these words they're saying dad yes

showed up basically he's still in

whatever he wears while sleeping but

just had like a sort like got her out

it's a ready just in case his entire

time he says the face of this is most

odd

it appears and Warrington moves to the

center of the room and doesn't

about-face and stares at palton now and

says and then looks down at the floor

and says by my measurements ensure

ejector a this was fired from the floor

someone very very short shot that into

the wall it must be a very tiny ghost

orange enemy kneels down to Simon's

height and then looks back in the ball

no too tall mm you guys figure out this

one it was fired from this exact spot

fire Paulson doesn't do fire that wasn't

me

and now I'm awake so I'm just gonna

start doing chores cuz I'm sad oh maybe

it was one of the cleaning maybe it was

one of the kids they don't know fire

either or they'll have us believe that

but I don't see anything burned I'm

really confused am I dreaming

I didn't wanna stay in any of these

words yes the training go back to your

room the kids the kids all come

downstairs and Jenks has got like his al

bear doll and he's clearly very tired

like walk into walls tired yes

the other two you know equally tired hmm

now is probably like continuing to say

like you probably didn't hear anything

go back to bed you guys are crazy it was

just

dream actually Strix will will Corral

the kids and be like okay well I'm done

cleaning so it's midnight snack time

everyone to the kitchen everyone gets

snack and then everyone just to go back

to bed

squiggly heard like an explosion is

probably like super hyped I think at

this point has a special pie for

squiggly that makes him a whole little

band of like squiggly pies and chili

cans are one of those then gives the

other kids normal pies like back to bed

it's like nyquil pies

you see Warrington is checking Simon's

hens for gunpowder residue not finding

anything mm-hmm of course I like he

hasn't spotted Andrea does he know okay

I want to like like telepathically

communicate with Andrew it'd be like

hide don't let him see you yeah sir

Warrington does a look around and every

time Warrington looks at one generation

Andrew Andrew just sort of scuttles on

the floor behind him to a new position

under some piece of furniture hmm

well I guess this is a mystery to be

solved in the morning but everyone's

fine you can't just have like fire

happening in your room for no reason I

mean it's it's probably fine I'm sure

there was a good reason for it that I

don't have a gun stand guard I'm not

real sleepy oh that won't be necessary

I'll do that it's fine I'll just stay

you get some sleep and you Simon just

you know go back to bed where you were

sleeping peacefully and I'll just keep

watch me kind of like shift eyes back to

the bed like under the bed I'm just like

okay we'll just sleep on this bed where

nothing is suspicious about it at all

suspicious I just like lay like

completely

good did the kids go to bed yes yes all

right in that case Turks will walk well

try and walk over it while she's

thinking about going downstairs to

changes her mind and then just knocks

over the door and is about to like knock

on the door and then just sleeps on the

floor outside the door okay all right

Warrington just sort of gives a raised

eyebrow and a suspicious look about the

room and then heads back to his chamber

fantastic it was just like in her little

nightgown keeping watch now she's like

but he doesn't touch the floor so she

doesn't make any sound but she's like

March patrolling across the in

importance room or outside in the room

okay oh good he's taking her patrol

duties very soon so even Anna's float

marching by your door Paulding yes it

will be much easier to sleep now I can

be quiet yes that is much more settling

well and I can die alright do you

actually try to get some sleep while

she's silently marching watching okay I

guess I try I feel like the guns pretty

well hidden right yeah mm-hmm all right

evylyn paulten eventually nods off and

you watch and Simon's just sort of

watching you his head going back and

forth just watching you occasionally

darting down to the bed but now looking

back back and forth back and forth

throughout the night this is what Mommy

does she protects you

you get a bit of an eye roll I think I

don't know if she gets like really tired

at a certain point I think she probably

like plops down on the floor and sits

and watches after a while I think that

she doesn't keep the marching up to she

after she does that she she sort of

props herself up against the wall and

then she kind of falls over wakes up

she's sort of leans in a corner finds

that incredibly uncomfortable she

probably you know that too tired to go

back to her room when you're like so

like amped from a day that you're like I

could never sleep and then all of a

sudden it hits you and you're like I am

dead and she like just like can't so

related to paltin spatially where does

evil and finally not off I think he's

probably like sitting against like if if

this is the door she's like right next

to it leaning against the wall looking

into the room okay so not close all

right

the morning comes and the bright dawn

light shines through parts of the house

now most of you are in rooms that do not

face the dawn evylyn is in Paul tans

room that faces north dia theorem also

faces North Strix room faces south and

west is in the hallway on the ground oh

right she's in the hallway outside

outside deaths room so she's just in the

dark okay so let's see do-do-do-do

palton you're the first one to wake up

you see evylyn sleeping on the job

exterior door yeah and like her hair

like this like wake up it was like like

look under the bed for the gun make sure

it's still there you like quietly ok

cool it's like ok I want to like try to

quietly take it and like you get just

onto my person yeah just make a

sleight-of-hand check not hardly

ok dexterity if you don't have a 17 ok I

believe that beats evil ins passive

perception yeah so yeah you're good

thank you you yeah it's like I'm just

gonna pretend to go back to sleep ok

never woke up

alright strict so you wake up you're in

the dark you're in a dark Hall oh I

forgot that I fell asleep here so you

just hear a continuous scream deep who

are now awake I'm awake

[Laughter]

same as before

starts the door weapon ready at the hand

fine strikes on the floor just like

huddle I'm going I'm sorry

yeah he'll see Strix there it's kinda

like been down on one knee like reach

other hand you like help her up ok

yeah she'll stay I don't feel like I'm

sorry I fell asleep outside your door

because I was too afraid to knock on it

that's the case tricks you need to get

back to bed oh no I slept floor is

actually pretty easy to sleep on when

all of you slept on is the floor okay

well thank you for carding me yeah

you're welcome

I was scared mostly but I they could be

considered guarding too that's that's

much much better yeah okay as you get up

and conduct your morning business you

know that you you realize that the kids

are not in their room they're downstairs

making breakfast with the help of the

help of some unseen servants are

basically whipping something up you hear

the clattering of pens some strange

combination of smells and deny teach

them this no oh but they've been here

long enough to know where everything in

the kitchen is I'm impressed

and you can see when you walk in Jenks

is sort of pointing his wand and

seemingly moving things around but it's

actually the unseen servants who are

doing yes oh yeah Jenks is like really

thrilled about this he's just like looks

for exile magic look I did it and strix

is just like I know you know magic yep

the kitchen is understandably in

complete disarray as a result of their

handiwork but no more so than it is

whenever Strix is in here so Strix are

kind of not put out by this yeah I just

I just note I noticed that they're they

kind of have their own probably

organized chaos yes so I'm just gonna

continue watching it'll probably go in

and start helping them okay

helping them finish breakfast for

everyone and you know get a pie ready of

your waffles and you can see all sorts

of batter around squigglies mouth like

squiggly on his cloak I talk don't know

no eat whatever it's fine

i drugged you last night so it's paltin

evylyn is still asleep you hear

clattering downstairs I'm gonna I'll

just at this point it's probably time to

actually get up like get out of bed and

like just kind of think about waking her

up in like she's probably tired she

probably needs to catch up on sleep and

I'll just like let her stay asleep as I

walked downstairs breakfast has had

everybody most of what is served to you

by the kids is completely inedible and

uncooked but there's there's some eggs

over-easy that are you know passable and

something that kind of looks like a

waffle passable kind of looks like a

[Laughter]

cool yeah you know I mean it's tricks

who's gonna eat it like it's the best

food she's ever had just to make them

feel good you've never had one with

eggshells in it before but it's kind of

a neat texture oh she likes it yeah

they're good for you on time I only ate

eggshells for like five months using his

Forks to like very very carefully

removed actually I was like as Paul

Tain's leaving the room like he kind of

feels bad for her being like propped up

against the wall so not that he's strong

enough but he wants to try and like pick

her up and just like flop her onto the

bed just be like that's probably more

comfy she's not she's not terribly large

despite her you know enormous strength

she's you know a petite thing we're not

wearing your armor correct evylyn uh

yeah no yes okay you can manage it or

the very least you can sort of drag her

gently

and I'm also flop her into the unmade

bed just make a roll would be 20 for me

okay

I see her like kind of rolling yeah okay

falling face-first I rolled a 12 okay

somehow you kind of sleep through it all

mm-hmm you might say something in your

sleep suggesting that somehow all of

this has been incorporated into a dream

you're having is going to make a special

breakfast for evylyn because she's never

up late and she's worried about her so

strix is gonna make her likes like sunny

eggs like in the shape of a Sun all nice

and just some just a nice special

breakfast and just like leave it outside

of the door because she's like evil and

was sad because we killed straw and

she's out of vampires to kill so I'm

gonna make her breakfast very good very

good

evylyn you wake up in Paul tins bed no

sign of palton anywhere Oh No if you

open the door too fast you're gonna run

over the eggs yeah yeah so you you you

well you're are you running across the

floor at this point are you flying

flying okay yeah you rip open the door

and you see two son eggs on the floor on

a little plate with a smile she's she's

like on a tear to go to her room like as

fast as possible cuz she's like not done

her morning ritual no one should see her

like this kind of thing but then she's

like

grabs them and runs okay

when you get to your room and you can

see where the Sun is at you can hear the

ruckus downstairs just the

cacophony of voices talking and the

usual morning business but you think

that you are well and truly late for

your mass no she like tries to do her

workout while she's getting ready

throwing you know puts her breastplate

on backwards puts it back on is your

breastplate magical mm-hmm one of these

straps breaks you pull it you pull it

too tight and it just snap

comes right off you hear all this like

just like little grunts and squeals from

as you whip around the plate with the

sunny eggs on it tips off the table and

fresh flat on the floor I relate to this

so hard and then you just see this sort

of egg mousse coming out from underneath

the plate don't worry we'll fix you a

single piece of toast she's just I guess

she just does her best and then kind of

like tumbles her way down the stairs

you're in you're in somewhat disarray

you know there's she's like desperately

trying to smooth things out she goes

like still working on getting ready

she's like hopping and like finishing

one boot kind of thing and yeah it was

probably explaining to anyone who's

listening stricter folding the rubbers

there out loud about problems and

suspicions he has about the Escalade

Strix is decimal definitely listening

she's like oh she's bad yeah he's

talking about been how she just got the

keys and all that he's how she's likely

after the dragon horde blah blah blah

and then evylyn shows up he's just like

oh yeah this will be quick right yeah I

mean I

yeah did they I assume that when because

they lived with me at the spire so I

assumed there was like at least

sometimes when even would like get them

to come with her but I don't know how

they felt about it like maybe they did

it out of obligation or maybe it like

wasn't so bad maybe was kind of peaceful

I don't know but I think that sometimes

they would come and just like lurk

paltin used to steal the wine so I was

cool with him it's like what your

friends ask you to like hey when I come

to the bar and watch my band play

tonight any sense phone Billy I mean if

it's for the blood of Lysander that

needs to be consumed and we must

obviously you know give thanks to

whatever let's go probably thank him

especially for last night when we killed

straw and we used that Sun source which

is basically like Lysander sword you

know and he blessed us with his light

and she's because she's frantic she's

starting to do the like constant talking

about let the under thing and just kind

of drowns out everything else and it's

kind of just like pushing everyone

toward the door yeah yes evil and when

you lip open the door you see on the

other side like just he was just about

to knock on the door when you whipped it

open it's dropped standing in the dawn

light the vampire straight no Todd

courser Todd the true nemesis of the

campaign and then he you sort of catch

him off guard with the haste with which

you whipped the door open and he was

surprised that his hand did not actually

connect with the wood and he almost

knocked you on the forehead but stop

short of that and pulled back in

surprise you can see there are a couple

other city guards standing away from the

door out and troll skull alley just sort

of waiting on him and after his initial

shock he he just sort of looks at you up

and down for a second like you're gonna

go out looking like that

ah hi Todd blessings of the morning Lord

upon you would you like to accompany us

to mass regretfully he says no he just

came by to let you know that a city

magistrate has kind of smoothed things

over with the Marg Astor family and

whatever transpired there and he doesn't

claim to know what will not be visited

upon you in any way he ones in that

awkward position where like someone

saying something really nice it's very

nice of them to have come all this way

and like you know that you should like

invite them in and like talk to them for

a while but she's like on a rage like

that's so nice thank you try to really

appreciate it okay we gotta go um maybe

you could come over later for some

coffee or something you're not you

didn't hear his reply as you barrel out

of the Waffle House who's the last one

out the door um I think it'll be it'll

be me cuz I'm trying to decide if I want

to bring Albie or not as like a friend I

decided to leave in my home because I

think he might be too scary because I

saw Gia's face I'm like like okay now

you go watch the kids okay in the mad

rush is it's just going to be the four

of you at this point yeah

[Music]

are you gonna bring your hand your gun

hand mm oh I'll leave them behind

okay see probably fine you're not gonna

bring gun ham to mass all right are you

planning to go there by foot then yeah

okay you reach the spires of the morning

you can see that evil and you're

familiar with this because you visited

the temple periodically over the last

couple of weeks but there has been sort

of a little bit more pump to the outside

regalia guards dressed in golden armor

stationed at various entrances

particularly after the security breach

involving XANA thar the guard presence

here has been greater but they're all

done up in ceremonial son armor bearing

not the familiar symbol of Lysander but

the older more archaic son symbol of a

Minotaur and as you lead them as you

lead your friends past the guards who

don't even bat an eye at you well maybe

on this occasion one or two of them do

sort of look at you in a slightly

different way maybe it's the way you're

composed yourself this morning maybe

it's just your urgency but something

about it is different than normal so you

do catch a little askew glance but then

nothing beyond that you head in and you

can see that people are spilling out of

the the narthex the knave out through

side doors and whatnot the mass having

concluded about five minutes ago

I well before before we react to that I

want to say I think that evylyn has

probably in the last few weeks been if

she's been visiting the temple I think

she's also probably been like spending

some time and study

this whole like I'm an auteur rebrand

thing it's really been bugging her like

she still says all her prayers so

Lysander but I assume during the mass

when Theatre is less and less present

and we're hearing an ominous or a lot

and it's really just like weighing on

her so I think she's been doing like

scriptural reading and like talking to a

few of the church elders like kind of

trying to get a sense of like what's

going on and why okay make a you can

make an investigation check or if you

don't have the skill intelligence 14

with that role you're able to ascertain

that a Minotaur is sort of symbolically

represented by the Sun not just the

morning as the as Lysander sort of

levander puts the emphasis on the

morning whereas a Minotaur is really a

Sun God but there is this sort of

element of bureaucracy to monitor that

Liffe ender does not have in his

portfolio this sort of order that you

know everything happens in a prescribed

way the same way all the time it's

routine and ominous Wars worship is

extremely so and in the bureaucracy that

accompanies it also so but what you're

able to learn with your 14 is that

father-son bright is bringing in a

consultant someone a Amanat or pilgrim a

traveling priest of great renown named

father Andrew core Merrill to help him

redefine the church in Amana tours way

and when she had asked him about it

before he had said like oh I'm not

thrilled with Andrew they're the same

thing it doesn't matter right yeah in a

fashion

he said not nothing would nothing would

change about how you you know conduct

yourself or your your position within

the temple or anything like that

so as masses like just getting out and

we've missed it evens visibly like

mm-hmm

very dismayed and like very troubled

because she he seems to

give the impression that at mass today

there was some some reason she really

wanted to be there

there are also large parts of the inside

of the temple that are closed off and

have been sort of shut down as

renovations are ongoing and any more

large evil in statues there are not the

one that did exist is no longer there

having shattered so there are no other

effigies of evil and haunting this

enormous place you do see sister in sin

SIA having a conversation with another

priest of the temple and it's a bit of

an argument and you can tell that she's

red-faced and quite upset and if I

remember correctly in Cynthia was the

one that kind of tipped me off that

things are maybe like cringing more than

you've been told right yeah she comes

she sees you and a smile crosses her

face the the frown disappears quickly

she makes her way over to greet you and

your friends and those of you who

haven't met a sister in sin SIA before

she is a a large very pretty woman and

in her you-you'd guest mid-40s late 40s

maybe early 50s it's hard to tell she

carries herself very well and and time

if that is if it is passed greatly for

her has been very kind but you can see

some some worry lines form in her face

and she tells you she confides in you

evil and that the temples she said was

the way she frames it is this you

request about the orphanage and possibly

putting the children up here that has

been denied the orphanage is temporarily

closing down and we're sending the

children who are here to other places in

the city until the new

bureaucracy is set up but for the time

being all funds are being channeled into

the restoration of the temple

well that just can't be right there's

just no way that just can't be right

well apparently the the temple is not

fit for our monitors glorious return

glorious return right when it strikes

like Peaks around like I think I think

this has gone too far I think that

somewhat something has to be done and I

far be it for me to challenge the

authority of the church but who is

making these decisions

well the priests have basically elected

Father Son bright as at least for the

time being the high priest of this

temple he has a great deal of support

and now with the arrival of father cor

Merrill is solidifying that support well

that's good because I know father son

right real well and I'm sure that he

would be willing to talk to me and I'll

go talk to him I'll point out this is

oversight that I'm sure he didn't do on

purpose and I'm sure that he'll change

his mind he has told me that he has your

full support well yeah of course he's my

friend and mentor and all that but I'm

sure he I'm sure he wouldn't ever just

turn whoa whoa whoa he's saying that she

had he has Evelyn's full support that's

what I'm saying yes yeah but at what

point did you say you're in full support

of this well I told him that he had my

support as a leader of the church

evylyn at what point did you say you're

in full support of this well I didn't

say that I'm sure it's just a mistake

you said there'd be displaced to other

orphanages which ones where she says

three priests have been tasked with

basically making sure that the children

are well provided for they have all the

if you fill out the requisite paperwork

you can you can probably obtain some of

that information given that evylyn is

your friend of course I think we should

just all go talk to father-son fry and

let him know that of course he wouldn't

want all of these orphans to be spread

all over the city it's hard enough not

having a home other than a home together

and they should all stay together in

their home and they should stay in the

typical so let's just go talk to father

son frightened and I'm sure that he'll

make it right

yes Trix is gonna look at look at us

instead see I just feel like I'm pretty

sure that when you start kicking orphans

out you or a bad person can't argue with

that

yeah I think he balloons ready the first

thing we should do is talk to father-son

bright and see exactly where he's

getting these notions sister and sense

here gives strix and and DF basically a

look like she doesn't dispute what

you're saying and then she basically

leans into you evil and says may I have

a word with you in private sure she'll

take you aside there's it there's enough

acoustics here where if you really want

to sort of position yourselves

strategically you could probably

overhear this conversation you know we

will and so she says I don't know when

but soon priestesses arrest is appointed

successor is destined to arrive in the

city she's traveling a great distance to

get here so it's unclear exactly when

she will arrive but she's left Cormier

left Cormier some time ago and could

arrive in Waterdeep any day now

and what do I do I already know about

this person you have heard that the the

previous high priest was arrests had

picked someone to succeed her you do

know that it was somebody not of

Waterdeep and you were told by sister

and Sen SIA the last time you spoke that

this individuals name is tal Astin ad

Aragon and I I don't know anything about

her other than that is the rest Victor

and sin CEO says the rest picked her and

that she is a true follower of left

fender well good maybe she can help me

talk some sense into these boys since

she says I'm I'm not sure that's how

it's going to play out what do you mean

from what I've heard tell us tinted

Aragon is a bit of an well rather legs

arrest herself a bit of a renegade she

does things her own way within the speak

within the spiritual edicts of our

temple of course it's nothing shady but

I've heard rumors about her that she is

not like us what do you mean she takes

you a little bit farther away into a

corner we feel like follow and she says

she's a drow oh yeah

a dark elf mm-hmm a priest of levander

great do you really think so why not

anyway mother mother's arrest asked me

to look after her upon her arrival and I

intend to do just that

yeah I loves the rest I think wait do I

remember you you know you knew of her

before you met her in her dead state but

I hadn't actually like met her man

exactly well it's the rest liked her the

not sure I'm gonna like her yes and she

sort of looks back at your weird coterie

of friends and says I you may be right i

lady the drought common Paulding like

leans over to strikes is just like well

I just feel like probably if I go talk

to feather sunbright will unravel this

whole thing it'll get off this I'm an

auteur kick and let the orphans come and

by the time she gets here everything

will be hunky-dory

I you can see the father has left the

main temple and is talking to a bunch of

people but given time you can sort of

separate him from the rabble and

basically corner him somewhere where you

can have a conversation just you and him

I think you can tell that evil ins like

she's putting on her church face and

she's like you know very proper and

everything but you can tell she's kind

of nervous for this conversation it

seems like this is why she was like so

intent on being at mass because she was

planning on talking to father sunbright

after having done all this kind of like

soul-searching on the ammonite or

subject so she's like asking her friends

to come along with her like she's very

much toting them as like security

blanket moral support even if she's not

saying like I'm nervous so she she kind

of was like come on come on I have to go

talk to father son right let's not get

separated

yeah let's let's go alright so the three

of the four of you are able to converge

upon him and you can see he's all smiles

sun bright is a sort of average height

average build man youngish late 30s

possibly with bright blonde hair and a

blond beard not terribly long well

trimmed hair well trimmed beard in the

full the full priestly vestments of a

Minotaur was it son right the one that

trained me when I was a kid that's right

does he wouldn't he have to be a little

bit older well this is doubtless the

work of some magic I thought so okay

well anyway even walks up it was like

hello father son bright blessings of the

morning Lord to you in this new dawn and

he he says you're late I am sorry and he

stops there and says what can I do for

you in sister well I was hoping to catch

you because I had been doing some deep

devotional study and I just I had some

thoughts and questions that I wanted to

talk over with you you know as a mentor

and then also I was just talking to

incense eeeh and she told me that there

had been this oversight about some

orphans and that they were being sent

away from the temple where normally they

would of course stay and have a home as

is the you know mission of the church to

provide safe haven and help for those in

need and I'm sure there's a

misunderstanding of some kind so I want

to

to let you know that was going on and

hopefully helped make sure that the

orphans could come and stay here all

together instead of being all separated

and sent away he says the temple here

has been mismanaged for a tremendous

amount of time much to my dismay by my

dad this all came to light very recently

and so I've appointed a body of priests

to help me get us to where we need to be

and so temporarily ivory allocated funds

to rebuilding the domes and the spires

as well as various interior chambers

that have basically been neglected we

are going to be attracting a tremendous

number of new followers once our Minato

rises to his pinnacle once again and the

space that this demands is great and yes

we are one of the largest temples in the

city and yet our plans require us to

make sacrifices

you see even kind of get like a little

bit of a like a like a bee in her bonnet

because he kind of he's quoted a little

scripture at her and if there's anything

she can do is quote scripture back he's

kind of like Lysander not say that what

good is a golden shelled egg if what's

inside provides no nourishment yes

indeed

absolutely and all of that text came

from the far more ancient and true texts

of almond Ottawa so we agree that no

matter how shiny the outside of

something is it's the inside that really

counts

exactly in comes day well no not

necessarily you see there are places

throughout the city well tended

orphanages that have space and they are

far more capable of educating these

young spirits

in the skills that they need to survive

and prosper in this world whereas before

our attentions were divided you know and

when the time comes when they are of age

we will bring them back into the temple

in various capacities that the young men

you know can serve and they will learn

the warmth and embrace the faith of Amon

Ottawa I think with all due respect that

might be a little backwards

because yeah children need to be

educated and they need to know the truth

but they also need to know how the real

world works they need warmth first they

need love first they need care and each

other and friendship first yes yeah I

don't think the orphanages are nice yeah

it's probably a test of that yeah she's

like scamp like a scamp looking at them

like we must have faith in our fellow

water davian's they we are all one

community this temple does not exist in

isolation from the rest of the city we

are part of the city and we have to do

things to create ties important ties to

the city you know what you're so right

and even looks at like the masses of

people leaving the temple and she flies

up into the air and she's like people of

our community fellow worshipers of

levander

Oh Mike just starts like the clang

actually is there like is there like an

organ in this estelle sure oh there's

planes something in G major

[Laughter]

you know the plight of so many in our

city who are less fortunate than us

don't you make a persuasion check my

firm under the table do some like like

foul mature G of crowd noises going

[Laughter]

and the least of these the most needy

are our children right yes the children

and you do see several parents with

their children and and whatnot in the in

the crowd I like like its specifically

point said families or children this guy

knows the church must provide for those

who need warmth and love and a family

and we can provide that

but unfortunately the church finds

itself financially unable to provide for

these orphans right now so what do we do

we stand with each other as a community

right we provide for these orphans right

and we're gonna start a fund right now

to make sure the orphans can stay here

and Waterdeep together aren't we

she rolls a 20 okay yes so yeah you get

the you get the crowd energized as the

light shines through the high windows

and gleams off of your hair and armor

and accoutrements and your boots and

your wings you think emoji shield which

has the angel emojis as like a

receptacle and she's taking like a

collection oh so fluttering around and

just sort of taking a yeah a sizable

collection yeah people were like bless

you people of our community we're one

family yes and she's just like you know

creating a community feeling you uh yeah

they start to dig deep into their purses

and spill coins onto your shield a few

well-dressed nobles with their prim and

properly dressed children kind of look

at you ruefully a little bit embarrassed

not to contribute as others look upon

them and so they throw some coins in as

well and someone else notices to the

like nobles not donating and then he's

just like and so more coins get heaped

on as you make your way around you can

feel the weight of the generosity in

your shield

evylyn and I think what um what I'm

trying to get across that she's done is

basically like a

nor the bureaucracy of the church to get

something good done and she doesn't care

that she's basically saying hey the

church is too poor to do good work yes

you hear father son bright muffled to

mumble to himself she's insane

dear snaps right back over item just

says what the did you just say I'm

sorry what my son what was that

what did you just say just now call him

son and he says my son I don't know what

you mean

I heard it what father or Priscilla

thandor looks it's what she's a cop see

right now to help refugees it says what

the is wrong with her India says is

very very loud

that's hmm echoes it's thaumaturgy from

the acoustics yeah plays my son do not

say such words in this holy place yes I

agree so then why did you say that is he

attractive crowd people are definitely

hanging on dias loud echoey words but

father son bright says let us speak in

chambers privately you don't go anywhere

that's not that's private we all go

together but good do good go somewhere

in private but you know together yeah

yes and he says he turns to the crowd

and says it is this generous spirit that

carries the city above all peers and

makes us the envy of the north I start

playing like evil music as he's talking

he stops he stops talking as he realizes

that his words are not being conveyed

properly with the musical accompaniment

and he retreats from the temple

clearly making his way to his chambers

I'm going to go with him okay speak

privately but as deaath does he's

actually going to turn back towards

Strix and Paulton I'm looking at Strix

and giving a hand signal just being like

polymorph rat looking over just gives

him like a symbol for like like he gives

a signal and then I like I'm like I like

slowly like kind of open up the codon

point of the gun I'm like and he just

just instantly just goes into you know

evil and you can basically take your

shield of coins over to sister and sin

SIA and agar brother priests who will

just sort of hold out their gowns and

make like bowls out of them that you can

just sort of pour the coins into devlins

in full like representative of the

church mode so now she's like continuing

to take collections talking to families

like thanking them shaking hands

pressing pong she could see her hair

[Laughter]

okay Strix rat follows DF paltin

yep invisible following gun out in hmm

you're still just alone alright okay

evil and you notice as you dump the last

of the gold out into the caring hands of

priests that you like you notice your

friends gambling off and DF sort of

gives you a very quick little symbol

sign to me probably what did what did

you think north emedia probably to

signal to you where

we're going and something along the

lines of we'll be right back so like

giving me the impression that I should

keep I should finish up what I'm doing

you guys are gonna go home while he's

invisible will like run by evylyn just

kind of like whisper just be like we're

gonna get father sunshine ass or

whatever we'll be back wait you don't

see him you just hear him I think she

starts to be troubled by that but then

like another Nobel comes by and like

grabs her hand and you know starts

talking to her again so I think she gets

swept up in like this the community

event she's created and stays out that

right yes you are you're intercepted

evylyn by a lady am Katherine who

introduces you to her son door temir and

Katherine is the the family that

commissioned the statue right that's

correct and she tells you that she

regret she regretted hearing that the

statue was destroyed and some act of

criminal vandalism but it was a pale

candle to you anyway and then she

introduces her son who thanks to you is

was able to be brought back from the

dead after a horse accident do I when I

look at him does the memory come back

yes a hug and like twirls him around

yeah he is here's the boy that you who

spirit you met in the soul monger and

she's kind of like wide-eyed because she

hasn't remembered like a full set of

events or a full person from that time

before you can see that he's just sort

of a dumbstruck by this by you sort of

sweeping him up and I remember you and

you can see sort of a faint just a very

dim recollection in his eyes as well

like he does recognize you but he's at a

loss for words we were dead together you

can see the mother get a little

uncomfortable and look to her valet when

say that to hertz child and we're both

alive isn't Lysander wonderful but then

she smiles and looks around at all of

the other people around and the boy

looks sort of momentarily horrified and

then he starts to tell you about how he

was riding his horse and he he remembers

leaping over or the horse leaping over a

hedge and him falling and hitting his

head but he doesn't remember anything

after that oh well I didn't until just

now but I remember us spending time

together and look the Anders room and we

rode horses there and we didn't fall and

even if we did didn't hurt because we

were in heaven and it was real nice and

I wrote morning glory my horse who was a

peg and she just like is telling him

everything she remembers from beginning

to end everything that they did together

but she makes it sound really fun and

exciting and pleasant and not scary like

being dead okay while that's going on

you can hear the mothers is just sort of

standing there hands clasped nodding and

smiling and generally looking very very

pleased that this is going so well and

she says you know perhaps the least we

can do I mean we we made the donation to

the church of course but we never really

thanked you perhaps you would join us

for dinner sometime I would love that

could I bring a +3

she looks at the valet and says of

course yes thank you that's so kind I

would love that when would be a good

time do you live here at the temple no I

live in a house well you could give my

valet your address and I will have an

invitation sent to you how that's so

fancy okay and she somehow scribbles

down the address yeah you're sure you

don't have anything on you to do that

about her valet can produce something

and basically take the notation of where

you live okay

so that's taken care of the rest of you

follow the father into his chamber when

you get there that room is not empty

there is another man older maybe in his

50s with tall and very thin with a

stringy long hair that goes down over

his shoulders and he's got a very sort

of pronounced widow's peak and thick

eyebrows that give his brow and his his

countenance sort of an intensity almost

hawk-like features a very sort of sharp

nose angular cheekbones and piercing

ice-blue eyes and as he looks over

toward you you can see he's got a

pendant of a Minotaur around him but

he's fairly modestly dressed he's not

dressed in the full priestly vestments

and regalia of the temple and father son

bright says father Andrew cor Merrill

these are water davian's that's just me

right that's right

this is he is a follow of our church and

and if he also then he adds and also

resided here for a time didn't you well

yeah that was a long time ago but yes

yes I remember the records and you can

see that this other priest is standing

next to a wine cabinet and is basically

pouring himself a drink mm-hmm and

paltin you see that it is a resplendent

display of wines

based on the nature of these this

cabinet you think that these are

probably wines that have been gifted to

the priest or maybe father son bright is

actually a bit of a collector of wine

but father cor Merrill is having his lot

oh go ahead so when I when I when an

object's on my person it is also

invisible right correct okay I'm going

to wait for the proper time to like

sneak oh we're just like occasionally

just steal a bottle and tuck it in my

coat not when they're being used of

course yes the the visiting priest comes

over to UDF extends his hand he's got a

drink in the other hand but he extends

his hand in friendship to you to shake

it and he says please while I am a

member of the Church of the temple while

I'm traveling I prefer the name Andrew

mourn sure we'll take the hand and shake

it and say yeah I'm death Woodrow

delighted and then father sunbright goes

on to tell you that father mourn is a

he's a traveling priest a pilgrim who

has taken the faith of all minotaur

across the North far to the east as far

as ration he says which is about as far

as you can imagine and then has brought

the faith of the son to the sort of most

remote corners of the world and even

converted a few Dwarfs and father more

an aka father cor Merrill looks a little

immodest at this very proud of his

accomplishments and kind of looks down

his nose at you hmm

I'm not impressed I get the sense that

this is a private conversation I will

sit myself out and back to my own

quarters it was a pleasure to meet you

d/f great to meet you Andrew

he looks to father-son bright Andrew and

then leaves hi Andy

father-son bright after father cor

Merrill leaves says that was not very

polite

sorry I'm not very good about these

things speaking not being polite

he says you in my tempo

I'll talk how I please that seems like a

good time to grab a bottle of make a

sleight-of-hand check to see if you can

do it without the bottle being its

departure being noticed in any way shape

or form do I get advantage for being

invisible yes sweet okay 14 okay you're

sort of horrified with how badly you do

that and yet and yet there's no

indication that father sunbright noticed

and he was practically staring at the

cabinet at the time maybe he just missed

it by a scant hair of a second you you

pilfered it away before he saw it but he

goes over to the cabinet and actually

takes the bottle down and a couple empty

glasses and goes over to his desk and

pours one for him and one for di and he

says let's clear the air I grab a glass

and that turns invisible and he he'll

pour a drink for himself he'll pour a

drink for you he'll tell you about the

vintage DF you don't really care

he'll set the bottle down and then he'll

take his cup and hand you one and he

says you want to talk straight let's

talk straight sure we can start off by

you saying that this is your temple as

endures under the understanding that

this belonged to Lilith and ER well

you're wrong

Amato

I have tremendous support among the

priesthood and they have installed me

here to course-correct

to set us on the right path and I know

in my heart and I know that this is the

path that we must walk on manotaur is

rising and when he does we must be

prepared prepared for what for he that

illuminates us all or more to the point

for the the the gifts and glory that he

will visit upon us for showing him the

respect that he deserves in his

long-awaited return and you believe the

way you can prepare for this is by

living lavishly spending money to put up

gold on wall to show that we care that

the his return is important to us now I

am NOT the most well versed and say I'm

an otter but generally speaking I've

imagined that whatever God of the Sun

probably doesn't give a or whatever

jewels you're wearing

and you're the expert but it takes a

drink

Derek during this talk invisibly as

paltin sipping his wine he also kind of

just you know standing behind him takes

out the gun and then just kind of gets

it ready points it the father goes back

and sets his drink down he says it's the

dawn of a new day DF there's a new

sheriff in town and that Sheriff is me

okay can I am like I'm like rat next to

him is there anything I can see like in

his desk that looks like fishy follow

Ratner um no you can see that there's

sort of a stamp and some sort of

religious books propped up on his desk

his chair is sort of a beautiful gilded

monstrosity with a with a chair adorned

with this Sun symbol this is all fairly

new you can see that a lot of the decor

in the room has recently been replaced

because you've probably been through

this area before

old symbols replaced with new symbols

there's a new big sort of bronze

Sun symbol hanging on the wall behind

the desk between two tall windows that

have gold threaded brocade curtains

coincidentally sort of shielding against

the Sun at the moment symbolic yeah all

right then I'll just try and not hole

through his room okay

success you sort of tear off like the

lower trim on his robe in sort of this

long tapering strand behind him all

right mission accomplished

yeah like after do you partake of the

that wine I don't drink any no yeah it's

just like kind of holding the glass this

whole time and after that display of

bravado death will say so that would

this

but this is all about you're just

seeking power for yourself so you make

yourself feel better no not at all it's

not about me it's about the preservation

of belief and faith and knowing that the

temple is not being mismanaged that the

money that the water davian's are

investing in this place is being used

wisely

and now you're an investment I thought

the only thing that temples cared about

was not about money or things well life

itself flees this is a symbol we're

standing in a giant symbol and this

symbol will crumble under its own weight

without the money to support it money is

everything in this city death it's not

what I want it's what it is if you want

to be the highest and the mightiest and

you want to attract followers then you

have to win over the nobility the

nobility is the money in Waterdeep and

they will invest heavily if they believe

that the church is working is it hot in

here or is it just me I've never had

such aspirations I've never wanted

followers or power or anything like that

only a safe place for me my friends at

one point we all have a calling mine has

brought me here and until some higher

power says that I am not fit then and he

collapses oh no those higher powers me I

become unavailable I'm just like I

didn't shoot the yeah you can see

that he he he looks stone-cold dead

by the time he hits the floor I mean

glass yeah check his body to see if he's

like see if he's like still alive or

choking or whatever seeing these dead

and then I immediately like go and check

his wine glass okay

Paul's answer I've just like turn back

from a rat and like immediately like

find some way to like lock the door like

to not let people in okay so you're

basically gonna go over and shove a

chair underneath the gilded handles of

the door

yeah and just be like no one can find us

in here like this they're going to think

that we did this so we need to leave I

have a spell that can get us to leave so

we're gonna leave but let's find out

what's going on first and then we're

gonna leave okay

DF you can see that his flesh is

starting to turn black in front of your

eyes and you realize he's essentially

flaming out well he is burning away into

basically charred remains it's like his

skin is just spontaneously combusting

before your eyes

I just based on what limited knowledge

I've had from and you go over to the

wine and you look at it I'm gonna now

you've you've babbled and you've

probably at poisoners kids are you what

not I'm not super knowledgeable about

poisons so like I immediately like going

through my catalogue of knowledge me

like is there any poison that even

freakin does if it likes tricks might

know you can either make a intelligence

Arcana or intelligence nature I'll do in

our cottage a I feel like that's my

abilities I get tell you like a poisoned

nurse yeah so I will I will let you I

don't know I'll let you make a

investigation checked yeah hey I only

got a 12 okay

Oh investigation 21 okay this is very

you do believe that the wine is poisoned

yeah you believe it is a it is a magic

probably magical in nature and you think

that

you have 21 that's pretty good yeah but

also even with the role I have yes yeah

it has never been like a one to use a

whole lot of poison yeah so this this is

a very you've probably heard of this one

because it's very very rare and it's

used by drow you know that it's you know

that it's colloquial name is Sun death

Oh like before do you can say things

like so I have a suspicion I think it

might have been poisoned but the

question is how did they get it into him

I just can't figure it out

I want to immediately check the bottle

that he used to pour the wines and check

for any sign of ring or the like okay

now you saw him sort of pull the cork

out of it yeah and was a no okay you

believe that it it had been previously

opened Oh God okay

your best assumption is since since it

had been opened before it's possibly a

wine that he liked yeah and somebody

would have known that and the only other

person in this room at the time was

Andrew or Merrill that is true and I an

see him do anything no it's bad oh I

should we shouldn't we can't be here

right now we can't go there's just a

sort of charred skeleton in priestly

vestments lying smoldering on the floor

yeah we can't leave now there's a

mystery afoot do you want me to clean

this up I'm really good at disposing of

bodies Oh feels like it's hiding

evidence he's right you can't tamper

with the evidence yes right now there's

three prime suspect all the police about

this why don't ya why don't I just wait

evylyn evylyn so the the EM catheters

seem to want to be on their way but door

tumor looks forward to talking with you

again and he wants to introduce you to

his horse and he hopes to meet Morning

Glory

and he can't stop talking about horses

even obliges fully and says she's really

excited to talk about horses as well and

his mother's like we must head back to

the villa now we'll see you soon

yes thank you for that wonderful

heartwarming speech well thank you for

contributing I know that you already

contribute to the church and I know that

it was asking for more but I think those

orphans are gonna be real happy and door

Toomer you're sure lucky to have a

loving family like this one and you

never forget it okay he nods and he wait

he'll wave he'll wave is he sort of

pulled away and thanks for this

you absolutely yeah so then he wants to

make sure she wants to talk to some

leadership other than father-son right

the people who are out here to make sure

that this money she collected is

actually going to go specifically to

making a place for the orphans here a

couple of the priests are like well you

know we've we've got to make sure that

the the money is essentially catalogued

and put into certain coffers and then

and they start to get through to get

into this bureaucratic rigmarole and

then sister incense he says I'm I'm sure

this is that sister evylyn wanted this

money put tourist specific use I think

we can probably find some method in the

bureaucracy to make sure that it gets to

where she would like it to go is this

bureaucracy like what has been always or

is this know this is new okay she'll

tell it she'll tell you that there

there's a new way for basically handling

any donations made on the grounds of the

temple and there's this whole system and

blah blah blah de blah blah de blah blah

blah blah none of which has to do with

orphans or children but sister and

Sancia says we will talk to everybody we

can and see what can be done

well what if um since this money was

technically given to me it's technically

mine so what if I make it conditional

that unless it goes directly to helping

these orphans I won't get it to the

church the priests kind of look at you a

little aghast like you were collecting

money in the church for yourself she's

like I mean not I mean like they can't

almost believe what you just said like

they're just like did she just say what

she just said

I'm just words look I just don't want

this money getting lost I want it to go

to the children so whatever we have to

do without whatever paperwork

technicality has to happen that's what

we need to do that's all I'm saying

sister in Senseo say I will do

everything in my power to ensure that

the money goes to where you wish

right and if necessary we can hold it

any trust until until - less than a

tarragon arise help yes that sounds

great

we'll do that okay okay and then they

they they leave and you go to see your

friends and you realize the door is not

opening oh you probably recognize the

panic it's like the hide the body

panic is there like a rug I can just

like put over it yes okay I just like

guys I got it this is big lump like like

an official and I'm just like oh he's

dead

[Laughter]

oh it's evil it's just like can't say

anything and she just like looks at

death comes up pulls Eve London and like

shuts the door behind her

and then turns to evil and just says I

don't know how much more you know but

father son right was just a murdered

ready to but didn't G for what it's

worth he's just like he's just he's

standing in front of this lump under a

rug right now and for what it's worth he

was a big dumb jerk face so there he was

like very there's a lot of emotions

happening for you yeah her father figure

then like making choices that she didn't

understand that she was like maturing

beyond and so she's like very sad that

he's dead and very confused and I think

she just

it's like she goes over and drinks the

wine on his desk I think she's kind of

frozen like okay okay I'll just I'll

fill you in so we learned that he was a

jerk and he was using the money to make

stuff fancy and he hated kids a lot he

thought kids were the literal worst

thing to ever happen his words not ours

and then his corpse just kind of like

burned and then he is you know

skeleton man and that's there is this

horrible stench hanging in the air evil

in that greets your nose nostrils for

the first time and it is the smell of

burnt flesh it explains everything that

happened in greater nuance I did not set

him on fire someone else did

kind of yeah how the last person in this

room was Andrew core Merrill how

father-son bright was basically a

self-serving prick and there's far more

going on in the temple that we're aware

of almost as if there was a power

struggle within itself and then how he

was killed by the drought poison Sun

death what makes it a drought poison

couldn't anyone use a poison well that's

DREV drought themselves the ones you've

created typically from the Underdark

itself but like if you wanted to get a

drought poison you could go get one

right

I mean it's extremely difficult by my

understanding but yes yeah it's kind of

a branding thing skull port here I think

there's like you can get like anything

there it's not like spooky place yeah

there's a lot of a lot of potential

connections you could get this I mean

honestly I think someone like Santa thar

probably could have gotten it but you've

also had some recent run-ins with the

drought oh we did after deer

realizes what's that yeah he's like oh

we should go

I have to I have to tell someone what

happened we can't just leave him here we

can we will we'll leave and you can you

can tell me on the way you can talk I

have an idea I have an idea everyone

no one's listening right I'll look out

the door no nobody's listening all right

we all go back to the house evylyn you

scream like it just happened and run out

the door and go and get help I mean that

is what happened yes yes but you're

going to act like it just happened and

we weren't in here and we're gonna leak

well I'm not gonna lie but I don't see

any reason why I need to tell anyone you

were in here because I'm a scary no it's

fine there's no reason she would tell

anyone that we were in here we should

braid out depending on who saw they only

know of two people who went in and out

of this room since father somebody was

here which is scary tiefling and not

Church person they didn't see you they

saw gams your car Meryl and they saw me

they didn't see you did they see you

sister and send Zia right now it's not a

good idea

oh just evil and really close and

actually a sir

evylyn this is really important and you

have to really think about this and

answer as truthfully as possible who in

this trust who in this church can you

trust right now can I roll in an insight

check on that you can no man 12

no no one yeah when when you say I can

trust no one

you can't think of anyone can I infer

that that means that like because when I

think about trust it's either I can't

trust someone to have my back or I can't

trust them to truly be in the service of

like the morning Lord you you can trust

that most of the people here are truly

in the service of the morning Lord or

not or but you're not sure who is with

Lysander and who is with the other guy

really because Father Son bright has

basically been kind of seeding the

temple with new faith new philosophies

bringing in new people rotating people

around it's all been a bit of a

maelstrom recently and it's very hard to

tell whose loyalties lie where and to

whom look there's a scripture that I

would quote if I actually knew what the

scripture was even does so she quotes it

but she says something to the effect of

like you do it one thing you're doing it

you do sense definitely is true is that

by and large people who work here are on

the side of good so even says something

to death about how like you can't always

see by the light of the morning but when

you find yourself in the darkness the

only lamp to carry is truth we need to

tell the truth like look evil and I know

we need to tell the truth I'm not saying

we're not gonna I'm just saying now

might not be a good time cuz when

they've only seen was death like this

one go in and they find him dead what do

you think is gonna happen

well me and death will go and talk to

them and you two can just

they're not gonna boo they're not gonna

believe you and they're gonna take

they're not gonna believe you and

they're gonna and they're gonna they're

gonna they're gonna blame him they're

gonna take him in any like grabs his

face like this is just like you see his

face do you know what they do to a face

like this in prison just like please I

don't want to see him hung again you

actually see des doctor like panic a

little bit like Pelton's right they're

gonna blame me oh god there's gonna

blame me again I think I have more than

a little respect and credence here I

think they would believe me well you

know that assaulting and murdering a

priest in Waterdeep carry is the

sentence of death look I don't know what

else we can do anyway if y'all are just

gone and I go saying that you know

nothing happened and people saw death

anyway that's not gonna convince anyone

and if we just leave then certainly

they're gonna think it was me and Ian

together icky feelings right running

away at all it just makes it seem even

more suspicious so I think we we lock

arms and we tell the truth together

no there's definitely another way to go

about this we're just not thinking of it

is there anything else about the body of

father son bright or what whatever

remains under that I can see or find

there is a there is a sort of a a holy

symbol now sort of resting in his

burnt-out ribcage this is after you pull

the rug back and see you know his

collapsed remains

evylyn is not okay when she sees now it

looks like he's been half cremated

except his except his garb is intact

albeit now sort of blackened by suit

when hides from that site sorry you can

see he's got some some ceremonial

jewelry that is customarily worn during

mass ceremonies he probably would

probably take it off and put it in a

small chest on his desk at some point

okay he even is there seriously is there

anyone here one person that would not

instantly that would believe us that

wouldn't just right off the bat just

like try and write out about this yeah

is there anyone that we definitely

shouldn't talk to well I don't know but

I was just gonna run out until sister

incense yeah because she's been real

nice and she seems really cool and she

seems wanting to do the right thing and

Rix's plan was that I should scream and

go tell someone anyone died I just I

think that DF districts should get out

of here before we do that and I'll go

with you and we will calmly talk to her

about this idea Thrones doesn't that

make him look more guilty she's I mean

I'll turn him invisible and he'll walk I

see bones right I think I think we can't

run away we can't run away yeah we can't

do it it's three against one you

can't yell like last time I ran away you

got hang me can't you hang together you

can't yell at me for something I'm not

even arguing it's not running away

it's just assessing how intense the

situation will be if we did this truth

is presented you hear a knock great I'm

just instantly like gonna turn to yet

invisible don't you there has to be a

willing thing so DFU not never mind it's

like a touch attacked isn't it so as

you're like you're reaching out to use

just like oh no I'm just here voice a

little voice a father-son bright are you

are you there to sign some paperwork not

available right now I'll come back later

thank you huh look the last person that

was in here was Andrew her Meryl I know

it wasn't me if it's not him I don't

know who else it would be well right now

the problem is not who did it it's who

everyone's gonna think did it and that's

why it's very important that right now

before anyone else knocks on the door we

go tell someone we're in a church you

think anyone here is actually gonna

believe the truth yeah are you what are

you saying jerks is like landing on the

ground like

even's legitimately like excuse me fine

do what you want I think I usually

believe the truth and I certainly am

here and you lived here for a while too

don't you forget it is my job to forget

all right well I go tell in Cynthia now

together

oh well strikes is a rat and she's just

gonna sit on DEA's shoulder I should I

leave the scene of the crime or is it

better if I just stay here and wait you

should come with me I think

okay are you going I trust you how about

I go get someone

how about I get the how about I get the

guard how about we cuff up death now how

about we cuff all of ourselves now and

be like well we might as well did it so

it'll throw this away I'm a rat

they make sizes by the way you know evil

and that there there is magic available

you've seen it you've used it to divine

truth zone of truth spells what not that

kind of thing so oh wait

those those things are available to

authorities and particularly the

priesthoods to discern who's you know

lying and who's not so maybe it's not

such a big question do I think that my

Ray's dead would work on him you don't

know

so with Ray's dead you need an intact

body this is Nancy talked about it you

would you minimus you would need

something more like a true resurrection

so I also need an intact body yeah yeah

so I just realized maybe even I should

go talk to someone maybe Strix and

paltin could stay here to make sure no

one else tries to come in and tamper

with the scene I'm not my rat head yeah

all right mister sounds reasonable

paltin

let's do it I just if you could stay

invisible and stay here too just to make

sure no one else messes with it and just

tell protects tricks like squeak all

right soap Alton and Strix stay evylyn

and DF head out evylyn and DF make a

investigation check to find sister

incense eeeh amidst this gargantuan

edifice called the spires of the morning

ok you are going around looking for her

with an urgency to you I might add that

is fairly difficult to conceal now I'd

like you both to make perception checks

okay for the record my mind must be

occupied because my investigation was a

natural one yeah you're probably

preoccupied yeah oh good that's a to

first napkin yeah except passive

perception sure 21 very good

so DF while you are consumed you are

thrown a little bit for a loop

you're kind of walking along one side of

a large space with giant pillars and all

kinds of gilded paraphernalia around Sun

gleaming off of everything glass walls

through glass walls and you see across

the temple on their way out is what

looks to be a half-elf indeterminate

gender hair basically shaved off except

for a mohawk and this

in a sort of ruddy colored skin but the

hair is blonde and wearing some amount

of jewellery and dressed not so much

like a priest but more like a wizard and

he gives you a look and a smile and a

nod and then a kiss goodbye and then

disappears before your eyes and that's

where we'll stop great cool good good

I like murder mysteries this is fun

really fun okay all right so we'll be

back next week with an all-new episode
