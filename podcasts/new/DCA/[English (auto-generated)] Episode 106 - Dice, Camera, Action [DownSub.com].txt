hey welcome to dice camera action

I'm your Dungeon Master Chris Perkins

and here we are once again and it's

possible Nate will be joining us like

last week he might just he's literally

trying to find a wife I was on tour he

was on tour several so there are

challenges but if he finds a wife I he

will crash the game and we will just

pretend like he was always here

previously in dice camera action the

waffle crew was celebrating troll tide

when their residents came under attack

by the Sabbath our guild which was

retaliating for infractions against them

by the waffle crew or that's kind of how

it kind of went down anyway the place

got a little battered up but that's it's

still standing still standing

everything's okay and some days a little

while later after the dust had settled

the waffle crude learned that the Santa

Thor was not done with them yet a

delivery arrived in the form of a moldy

coffin held aloft by some gasps spores

that coffin contained the severed head

of Juan Nazca our gray a former Santa

thar guild dwarf enforcer who turned

traitor in addition to his severed head

there was his crossbow and the petrified

hand and shattered torso of what may be

a Lysander worshipper as evidenced by

the petrified holy symbol on the

shattered bust these the petrified hand

was also holding a scroll tube the party

fought the gas force destroyed them some

more gas pores came up out of the head

of the dead dwarf those were dealt with

evylyn using her divine sense detected

the presence of a fiend nearby in the

street and although this fiend was in

human form she attacked him a melee

ensued assisted by Ben wind bronze

bottom

a dwarf who had come to the waffle house

for waffles and found pies instead

evylyn and bin win murder ated the fiend

which turned out to be a rock shaza a

tiger headed creature with

backward-facing hands and as been wind

dealt it the death blow it severed a

tiger head warn Ben wind that

but then the city watch showed up and

bin when gave them his card meanwhile

Strix using her word of recall for the

first time teleported herself the waffle

kids and death to her sanctuary in the

Waffle House DF having managed to secure

the scroll from the coffin moments

before disappearing as the city watch

Corden's off troll skull alley again and

take the question many times the

questions witnesses again becomes

apparent exactly what had transpired and

when they see the the pool of Eker

that used to be this raksasa it becomes

clear that whatever you killed was

probably evil and probably up to no good

yes and evil and made a very compelling

case yeah well it's just the facts of

life if it's evil it's evil and shall be

smoked and smote it was dia if you're

clutching this scroll as you're in this

room with these kids and Strix

yeah Strix will sort of also be like

yeah it worked and then like look at DM

to be like I didn't mean to bring you I

just did it because I was scared that's

that's fine Strix do we do we do we like

have a moment now is everything kinder

apparently calm as far as you can tell

sequestered in this room that you've

just teleported to things seem pretty

calm you have no there is no window in

this room that faces out onto the street

where the action was happening so you

can't really see what's going on out

there what is going on out there is the

city watch are now starting to poke

around that moldy old coffin lying in

front of your house and are looking

inside at the petrified parts and the

severed Wharf head oh yeah what time is

it Oh 2 p.m. it's think it's time to put

the kids to bed yeah you get these at

howls of protest

yes drinks its tricks again

just perp was going to just try and

bring the kids inside but she was too

scared so she also brought to you it's

like sorry but she'll go put them to bed

if she wants to go read the film

whatever you don't need to have to take

a nap or anything just make sure they're

safe I'm gonna make sure the others are

okay too and I'll be like poke my head

out real fast to see if I can see

whatever the heck evylyn is doing and

whatever didn't win waddled off to what

I just wanted to say all the kids I

assume like protest severely of

absolutely but not doesn't at least not

in front of Diaz she was like oh yes of

course

you know like trying to be mature but

she secretly signed some naughty words

[Laughter]

evil evil in an bin when you're out on

the street with a city watch and a bunch

of spectators evil uns probably just

like greeting everyone like if there are

any neighbors she hasn't met she's like

oh I don't think we've been introduced

it's good to see you out here you know

that our weekly investigation Bloc Party

I'm evil in your name just make a

persuasion check for me even as you make

nice with the neighbors who as you

recall just recently sent you a nasty

letter I rolled a natural one

okay so you get some very suspicious

looks people sort of when they see you

approaching they kind of turn away in

either fake engage in conversation with

whoever's near them or just try to move

as far away from you as possible

that's alright not feeling talkative

today I understand have a good one oh

[Laughter]

did the city watch they they are okay

with what we've done correct they have

not expressed any concern about you

committing any sort of crime they look

at the pool of IKAR and the empty

clothes on the street they pick up the

clothes gently to see if there's

anything left of the being that you

killed finding nothing of consequence

they start rifling through his overcoat

and they find some cards similar to the

card that you gave them

that seemed to indicate that this

individuals name was Vincent trench and

he ran a detective agency and oh look

his address is right over there it's to

a building that's a few well maybe about

seven doors down or so from where you

had your waffles or your because his

trench is an awesome detective named was

he wearing a trench he had an overcoat

yeah but I'm not sure you'd call it a

full trench coat but then I saw the card

I saw where the address is yes and it's

the Detective Agency is called the

Tigers Eye evylyn is like I better go

notify the next of kin in case they're

also evil demons well I'll go with you

yeah that's two of you head over to the

Tigers Eye which is closed up tight

evylyn as you use your divine sense you

are not sensing the presence of fiends

within 60 feet of you

thousands of treasure inside that's hard

to tell this is a very secured or not

not well not not a door that I mean you

you've conquered doors greater than yes

I uh I tell Evelyn I tell even to

accidentally trip me

and then I knock the door in she doesn't

even ask you questions okay why I go oh

no make a strength let exchage you try

to force open the door okay so I rolled

a 17 in my athletics give me a plus 9

okay yes so you you crash open the door

and stumble inside with a large whoops

there are city guards who can hear the

ruckus evylyn as you stand outside you

just see bin wins legs sticking out of

the darkness and looking back there are

guards kind of glancing in your

direction with quizzical looks on their

faces like what's going on over there he

tripped I tripped him though on purpose

I'm okay

I screamed from inside the home

DFS you make your way over to a window

and you stick your head out into the

street you know you see these

shenanigans going on further down the

street I just see that they're causing

more problems yes so if it's kind of

like leans his head back in just kind of

goes gives himself a little okay tricks

just watches that whole thing like

uh-huh uh-huh one thing at a time but

catch up with them in a moment

yeah wait don't tell me they broke down

a door they broke my door really want I

really gonna read this scroll that I've

been holding on to cuz while they're out

while they're trying to figure out that

 I'm still

trying to figure out this whole corpse

bomb situation so once I get this

figured out as much as I can then I move

on to the next thing you know as a

responsible person when you read not

easily distracted when you remove the

scroll from its wooden tube you can see

that it is hastily scrawled in sort of

shaky in a shaky hand but it's not a

letter you believe it's an actual

magical scroll with a spell written on

it and the title of that spell even

though you can't quite make out the rest

of the script you can make up the title

it says speak with dead Strix is

obviously as soon as she see this

ghiyath unfold the scroll she's like

behind him like haunted like who you

know topping up to look over yeah I know

that if you get a spell scroll and the

spell is a spell that's on your class

list you can try to cast it from the

scroll if it's not on your class list

you cannot use this world yes so as soon

as she sees that she can use it because

it's a priest spell and she had her

clerics spell and she has cleric spells

so she sees it and she kind of looks

like gestures to the outside and looks

at it because it looks to the outside

looks at it and she goes I I don't want

to do this but I feel like we have to do

this you see the city watch is picking

up or trying to pick up the remnant

bashed moldy coffin we need that to get

it off the street and basically out of

open view alright I will hold my hand

out nicely and say can I have this go no

I agree with you I don't want to do this

but do remote I said when they were

trying to send a message they were

sending a message I'm just like take it

come out I don't want to go alone well

no I'll go with you then we see a

fastidious office and clean as a whistle

there is a smell of incense hanging in

the air but it's not a fresh smell the

incense probably was lit at least over a

day ago and it's sort of dissipated so

it's only just a very you know scent

very spicy you can see that arranged in

perfect Feng Shui is all the sort of

comfortable parlor furniture as well as

there's a hanging sensor above a coffee

table and a some beautiful paintings and

statuary busts and things kind of

arranged neatly about the room against

the far wall near had locked what

appears to be another locked door though

not quite as heavy as the one you just

barged through and that and the door

made of more of a redwood you see a

black cabinet with glass doors inside

which is a collection of books and

artifacts not magical artifacts but just

kind of like knickknacks of historical

significance like Hummels yeah you can

see there's there's like a mask on a

stand we get the dead body they get to

have fun there's there's what appears to

be like a pipe a smoking pipe box closed

with a little clasp and various other

you think that it's possible that in

exchange for services that this creature

this detective may have allowed people

to pay

with trinkets and other things instead

anybody home

all is quiet is it only one floor no

it's a three-story building you think

given the shape and the position of the

the room and the the red door across

from you that that might lead to stairs

going up

I turn to evylyn and I go it looks like

this cat was fancy I'm CSI Waterdeep so

I'm gonna search with my amazing wisdom

I'm gonna search for any trapdoors all

right so then when is deep in the room

at this point evylyn you can see however

that to city watch people a woman in a

man a sergeant and a constable have come

up to you and they say no no no you

can't this is breaking and entering our

place is closed off until the city watch

and the watchful order investigate

further my bad

I just we were just trying to help I

approached that guard mm-hmm and I tell

him listen this is way beyond the city

watch I am I'm a colleague of a Lord of

Waterdeep you've probably heard of a

momen dran one of the guards looks at

you oh no and just kind of gives shoots

a sidelong glance to the other one and

then she says to you you mean one of the

masked Lords of Waterdeep who's well so

you know about him good so we're on the

same wavelength right worst kept secret

of water tea okay yeah now you know how

serious is she so get out oh no

may the morning Lord bless you and keep

you and you tell you could tell that

your words your words have all but

convinced her that this is some ploy of

yours to take advantage of

the dead man and seize his goods she was

trying even's trying to signal very much

so that she was not doing that that

she's just like whatever you say having

fun with Ben when she has no ulterior

motives

and then as you guys come blundering out

the sergeant turns to the constable and

says do not set foot away from the door

frame and do not let anyone inside this

building why she ignores you people here

sure rude today everyone get up on the

cranky side you don't want you to tell

evil in that this this sergeant is being

super super cautious because she's a

little you you get the sense she might

be a little out of her depth usually

when people are killed in the streets

they don't turn into wreaking black

pools of IKAR

would it be would it be possible after

the captain leaves to try to intimidate

her

you mean you mean the after the sergeant

leaves to intimidate the remaining

constable or to follow her as she leave

no to intimidate the remaining constable

I started or yeah you can certainly do

that because he's currently just

standing there by himself gazing at you

sternly I think at that point even was

already weaving to go see what happened

with Strix India okay is that okay

that's what the party like that do you

if I think that even wouldn't be one to

intimidate a constable so this is kind

of her like didn't know I get it

listen I've known lawful good people

before neutral good Oh neutral good

neutral good which most people don't

know that little reminder dad well I

want to try to intimidate what does it

what do you say or do I tell her that

the cap of the guard isn't know what

he's talking about he's only seen what's

inside of the city I've been everywhere

he doesn't know how dangerous stuff is

in there and if you stay by this door

you're gonna die you need to let me in

there and take care of this

may can intimidate check and make it a

disadvantage because he's been given

specific orders by his boss to the exact

contrary so I rolled a 15 and a 13 and

my intimidate is plus 6 so 19 okay he

says he seems intimidated by you and he

says I have orders from my sergeant not

to let anybody in here that includes you

don't hurt yeah okay but I know I don't

want I don't want to make this yeah is

there something that you are looking for

in there yeah I'm looking for loot but I

don't want to tell him that why not he

says maybe you dropped something just

inside when you fell yes I did something

very valuable I just want to go in and

check it all right you have two minutes

okay I'm just gonna make a perception

check to check for any hidden panels in

the first floor evylyn still wearing bin

wins helmet yeah oh yeah okay sure and

in DF and Strix you can see evil ins

making her way back toward Waffle House

it to the body yet yeah you can stop the

city guards that are have been ordered

to cart this out of here yeah I

guess Strix is gonna look at the guards

and be like are you collectors these I

don't think you'll get much zinc for

this body it's ours they look at you

strangely and then they say no we have

orders just to get this off the street

and somewhere safe where it can be

studied oh well where can I can I cast a

spell on it really quick sergeant I

didn't want to talk to authority I don't

like Authority like I feel like Dee if

this is looking off into the distance at

like a seagull and Strix just walks

ahead and is like ah hi he's probably

like was walking for the next load has

pasted a little bit as he looked over

like what is evylyn and Ben win oh she's

coming okay good oh don't talk to the

normal people yeah

alright strictly sergeant comes over to

you and he he's just sort of raises his

eyebrows expecting a question hello I am

a representative of the lawful order of

the Chickenfoot coven and I am here to

perform a cleansing right on this body

to make sure that it's safe to card away

make a deception check this is my face I

make seventeen he says I've never heard

of the Chickenfoot coven

worried we just moved here from a cult

on this speak with the dead

can i watch oh yeah yeah sure do you

like pies yeah you should come back

later and get a pie we're just around

the corner there really good

okay she's makin friends yeah he has

them set the wreckage down back on the

ground they all watch you

I mean loom over the moldy spore

infested head of one Nazca air gray are

we supposed to talk to Nazca or this

dead person well only the head of Nazca

remains in this mouldy old coffin

the two pieces of petrified human body

is part of a chest that shows a simple

that shows a holy symbol of offender

around its neck and a hand so we don't

have anything I don't there I don't

think you can speak with dead with Pete

if things turn to stone right correct so

really have to talk to Nazca Shh

don't don't show that I don't know what

I'm doing here that's I'm evil and

you're here now with them

 hey what do you do as actually

saying what are you doing Strix is like

man just cast the spell on Oscars head

evil and make a perception check as she

cast the spell my perceptions so bad six

okay you're able to see yes it is in

fact NOS cos rotting head inside the

coffin which is pretty gross but you

also see a petrified human hand and a

petrified holy symbol of Lysander around

a petrified partial neck looks like

somebody somebody looks like somebody

dropped a human torso and shattered it

on the floor and put a piece of it along

with a broken hand in the coffin even

has a very strong Constitution but this

this is a lot even for her dead friend

who they had just kicked out kind of a

roommate and then also like iconography

of her god on an unknown torso with his

head like this is a lot yes yeah so I

think I think she probably like screams

a little and takes a minute yeah okay

and if she if she sort of you know

clutches her chest it makes a gasp like

one of the city watch guards will just

sort of stand next to her to sort of

brace her to make sure that she's okay

and doesn't faint away on the street

thanks Todd alright and Ben win what was

your role on a teen perception okay you

find you believe that there is a secret

door behind that black cabinet it will

require some strength to slide it or

move it out of the way however okay and

the reason you know that is because you

could glimpse be underneath the cabinet

a thin sliver of light a telltale sign

thirteen plus my strength modifier up

eighteen all right you're able to slide

it away and beyond you can see Aiken

sealed door that has flickering light

sort of seeping out underneath it the

door does not appear to be locked and it

doesn't even have a a knob or anything

it just pushes open okay like a section

of wood wall pray for no traps that

aren't poison

am i open the door all right when you

look inside you can see that there is a

unfurnished stone room beyond that has

what looks like a pentagram made of

entrails on the floor at the points of

which are five small steel braziers with

burning flickering coals in them that

has made the place both warm and dimly

illuminated mm-hmm you can also see that

there is some blood smeared on the walls

that looks like it's been put in the

form of glyphs maybe protective or

abjure ative glyphs and there is a

wooden or sorry a stone lectern kind of

short and squat carve to look like a

devil grasping the top of it and you can

see that there is a book with blood

script written on its pages that would

have to be a book every instinct screams

to back out of this room so I'm gonna

grab that book alright you're

able to wrest it from the top of the

lectern mm-hmm

when you do the lectern animates stone

devil sort of oh crap not a curse on

this show that's fine yeah you're good

it's it sort of makes these sort of

creaks and cracks noises as it comes to

life so roll initiative for me Scott and

I'll get back in just a second

no problem

Strix you cast the spell

that's me casting the spell one hand the

scrawled words on the scroll disappear

and the scroll turns to dust in your

hands as the spell takes hold and gnaws

cos head comes to life gaining a

semblance of life really

the way she cast speak with dead is it

just her like an communicate or is he

just like talking out loud to everyone

I'm glad you asked

so it will talk out loud okay and but

it's it's Strix that has to ask the

questions and she gets up to five let's

make these count all right Strix will

hold up her hand like okay we have five

questions for floatie dipped head had

man as Nausicaa opens sort of one of his

eyes all the way and the other eye

slightly you can see that his mouth

starts to yawn open as well and some

goop kind of seep some brown goo kind of

seeps out through the corners of his jaw

and down into his patchy beard you all

buries your head in Todd's chest and

eyestalk also erupts from nos cos

forehead it just bursts out through a

crack in his head and just kind of looks

around and stares at everybody and then

blinks at you twice Strix I just don't

at which point some of the guards are

like they all pull out their swords and

weapons and things and immediately go

into a defensive stance I mean I

appreciate that but don't worry we're

professionals yeah dear me like puts a

hand up and I'm just like trying to hold

on hold on now this is normal normal but

we're professionals don't worry she's

like looking at the crowd is it don't

worry we're magic professionals here

alright five questions and you can take

your time you don't have to rhyme them

off all at once the morning the Lord yet

because I start we should start worth

asking

him what happened to him and why all

right jóska

what happened to you and why this isn't

NASCAR

this is Anitha she just stumbles

backwards into the street wait how is

this possible I thought we were speaking

with the dead let's identify himself his

dead or my spores have infected no

strikes you're fine oh come on I need

you right now okay your mistake messing

with me we're not okay ask him where's

your joy boy palton anyway probably

walked away to get drunk don't don't

know we're asking the questions retain a

firm stance against this okay

ask him if maybe he'll just be nice to

us from now on ask him what is it that

zanaffar wants from us um what is it

that you want sir oh you heard him I'm

sorry I don't have to repeat him I'm

just very scared no no very Awareness

Day really answer a question though I

think we're on question two right yeah

we didn't figure out exactly why he

killed mouseka yet well that's cause

it's later he betrayed me he was

supposed to die for me dad Todd will

take you into his car his

his arms and pachu I have a question for

him but you go first

maybe the last one I can ask him

everything will be all right you're not

the boss of me

that's true what I always liked your

best really no evil do not listen to him

stop sorry I had to kill your priests

but which one I know does he count

for questions I swear to god Todd if you

follow all love with Yuval into your

memories I have one more

I'll give him until you come and get him

one more priest that's right why they

gotta be my priest if you like me the

best he says there are strange things

happening at your temple I know this

because I read Perkins notes I really

don't like that it's not important I am

important 13 what do you expect to do

with almond or it's higher in my lair

what almond at war yeah what's an

ammonite oral good stuff that's

happening at Yvonne's it's clearly in

the pantheon obviously he doesn't know

as much as he likes to think he does

excuse me he's clearly talking to all of

us this spell was

was broken I was the one who's asking

questions I thought it was

we know what's going on I'm trying to

calm the crowd I think that it'd be a

place in all of you yes yes well if you

want to say something about what's going

on at my church you just outright say it

right now he says I'm going to blow it

up that's bad you can go ahead and try

but why because you don't belong there

why no no no we just met and I don't

know that we can know that yet at this

stage in the relationship but why

sianeth or you would love with evil and

he says I like her a lot but I'm really

enough to me everyone this all this

other stuff about gold and stones of

galore I don't care about that well look

if you if you do care for me how about

this

don't blow up my church too late okay

how about this you claim to have one

more priest of lysander and you want us

to come get her fine why are you keeping

it to him fine were you keeping it I

think I hear him

yes okay okay but where you you want us

to come get this priest that's right

okay well if you wanted to date you

should have not kidnapped a priest but

where is it he says

Australia the wedding time what makes

you think we're even gonna bother with

that because it is a priest of

left-hander you wouldn't let a Bristol

offender die no he wouldn't

no Scott what'd you do I rolled one for

initiative Wow okay

this creature attacks you does it look

like again like in like an animated it

looks like it looks like a like a four

foot tall stone statue of a devil with

wings that are sort of unfurling it mmm

so it has your it has your stature

basically it lunges at you and tries to

bite you with its needle sharp Stoney

needle fangs it rolls a 20 total that

does hit my armor class by two so all

right so he bites into you for eight

piercing damage he rakes you with it

rakes you with its claws and hits you in

those as well and you take another seven

so you take a total of fifteen points of

damage from this stony devil okay what

do you do I am going to make a menacing

attack and expend a superiority die now

do I expend that after I hit you can

decide to spend it after you've rolled

perfect so I'm gonna take my weapons and

hit so I'm gonna swing with rook then

ruin okay so here's rook that is a 20

hit dirty 20 and ruin is a 18 hit okay

so rook does one to eight plus six nice

14 okay ruin does one D eight plus five

and will be a maneuvering attack

so that's a seven I'm John 1:12 had to

add that up my fingers cuz I didn't go

to school now he has to make what was

the damage on the second attack told us

five twelve okay yeah got it so it's a

menacing attack so he asked to make a

wisdom saving throw and beat a seventeen

or he's frightened of me till the end of

my next turn he did not and looks

frightened of you until the end of your

next turn moreover your two hits did

considerable damage chipping away large

parts of his body and actually taking

off one of his wings completely so he

looks pretty bad hurt at this point cool

when he retaliates or actually because

he's frightened of you he's got a

penalty if he tries to attack you right

as he moves away from the source of his

fear but he's a little cornered in this

room so in your standing in the doorway

so he will attack you but with

disadvantage on his attacks

oh no well I mean he's he can't

willingly move closer to you but you're

engaged with melee anyway so what you

gonna do what you gonna do he misses

because of that and he misses again he

would have hit you twice more but nope -

misses all right and then what do you do

I'm gonna finish him off

how about it by this time you can hear

that the guard is coming in behind you

obviously it's wrong drawn by the sounds

of violence uh that's fine

hopefully all so the first one was a

sixteen rook was a sixteen that's a hit

and ruin was a twenty-five said okay so

eight for the first damage 13 for the

second okay

it shatters okay

I quickly shove the book in my pants

okay evil book down the pants and then I

assume the guard comes and goes

yes I'm like I mean he looks around and

it's just kind of horrified he sees the

entrails on the floor and just kind of

gags I go what did I say what did I say

let's get let's cheese it we got to get

out of here now yeah he he he backs out

of the room and follows you back out and

immediately goes looking for help yeah I

walk over to these guys and I'm like

what's up what are you guys talking

about subway versus Quiznos anyway I

just

if you guys need this the rest of you

are in this conversation with the

severed head with a nice dock sprouting

out of it and it says once the church is

gone and your friends are out dead we

can spend lifetimes together panic

attack on the ground

why why why why are we the villains am I

one of the villains that's right

why because you killed my goons

[Laughter]

especially by mind flayer I needed him

for what what's that dude to put brain

look like it's poisonous evylyn just

slaps her hand on Strix and it's like

 blades on hands four five I carried

you of whatever you feel better wait I

do feel better yeah and no I'll deal

with you to Todd if you don't take our

hands out her no very close and you need

to accept that wait what's wrong with me

and Paulson like why don't you like evil

and indeed but Mia pulse in her bad

whose death Oh correct that is the

correct response just don't kill him

Oscar never mentioned him nasca told you

about us oh yes I made him tell me

everything about you before I killed him

[Music]

Oscar spoke very well of you evylyn not

so well of you Strix and less well of

palton okay Nazca head with ice Fox

sticking out of it

why who is this who's the petrified

lysander person also in this box before

I don't remember he said his name might

have Cara

rates like they know what the temp all

can I can I roll another perception

check upon that information to see if I

recognize anything about the journey you

could ride Scrolls though seventeen you

look at it there's not a lot left the

hand even though it's petrified suggests

the hand of an old man that's the one

clue that you can make out the holy

symbol is one of these sort of when you

study that and look inside it kind of

dawns on you that it is at one of the

older holy symbols that there have been

newer versions models that have come out

this is an old one the only priest I

really his name was father Christmas or

something I don't know it's my favorite

holiday not mine well don't worry we

never have to spend it together then

look you you

and you're just not really telling us a

whole lot did you just want to you know

call and hear our voice is that what it

is or did you have something to say he

says I just wanted to tell you and you

won't have your friends around much

longer your temple much longer well that

is not a very nice don't make me happy

with you at all and I don't like it when

people kill my guys I will never forgive

you for that

well I hate to say it but you better get

used to it

cuz we're not letting up and there's not

a single thing that you could say that

would give any iota of intimidation

against us threatening here at our house

no I read it was made a mistake we're

coming for you evylyn raises an eyebrow

death and like wiggles her sword a

little bit like can I cut the iStock off

now yes

she just cuts it off make an attack roll

actually roll initiative not as a hammer

but I might be dying of spores

initiative is 18 all right you can see

that the the I stock does when it

realizes that a threat is imminent this

sort of little glimmer of magic inside

its pupil gleams as though it's getting

ready to fire off array but you get to

attack it first evil in ha with the

flaming heart of Spinelli I rise yes

with 20 all right you swing at it and as

the I sort of bears down and says you

just slice it off it and it sort of

lands on the ground twitches and wobbles

a little bit bleeds out some foul goo

and then expires and then nos cos head

sort of closes its eyes kind of half

closes its mouth and goes dead it did be

hanging up and then the headaches

loads with spores everybody in the area

to make a constitution saving throw

diseases clean bin win and evil and

you're immune to disease you're fine

Constitution Constitution I think I'm

trying to remember whether my aura helps

about oh well I mean you get like a +6

yeah so you get everybody gets plus six

on there saving throws because of evil

in their presence wait it's plus five

plus five sorry but I thought I had

another aura but that may be a few

levels from know that like is protection

from disease or something all right

um so so folks been win how did you do I

did twenty seven and death and ten

I have enrolled Todd yet districts so I

rolled a one okay but with all my

bonuses I got a nine great all right and

I have to roll for all of the city

guards who are present there are six of

them no Todd did okay is your bonus

extending to the city guards as well

even though she's in the picture I yes

okay sir all right

especially Todd especially tall griffey

all right

so dear mr. X you've failed all of the

guards succeeded Ben when you succeed

okay so because of that DF you take the

offense tricks you both take 45 points

of poison damage and Ben when you take

22 points of poison damage you take 11

points of poison damage noise and each

of the guards takes 22 points of poison

damage oh

and so all the guards are sort of

choking and gagging as the spores erupt

all around you but none of the guards

appear to have been killed by the poison

they all were all have enough hit points

to withstand it can I tell who has been

like infected yeah you can tell almost

immediately because there's sort of like

a gangrenous transformation in their

flesh as strix and DF both seem to have

caught the full full measure of it

evylyn is like mildly it's like a mild

annoyance she's like oh so

oh and she goes over and again does a

little lay on hand she's like be healed

in the name of the morning Lord vanishes

that they're poisoned please the evil

from our bodies so you're laying on

hands on both of them five points five

points and they heal their disease

I'll pull both their heads next to my

head okay likes mushroom and just like

me

all right it wasn't coming out dia

thesaurus like yeah I had to hit points

left just so more than five each I give

them like 20 each if you hadn't give me

those 5 hit points I'd be 5 5 giving

away 5 points eats away the disease that

leaves them with 15 points that they can

use to heal up so you guys get back 15

hit points - are you going to give any

additional healing to been win or any of

the guards Todd been when how you

feeling I am doing well at well I have

99 of 125 hit points so I can't complain

I think you're fun yeah Todd I think

okay evylyn kisses him on the cheek for

one hit point okay he'll take that just

a little something

thanks for letting me as these spores

drift away you can see that not really

almost very little remains of nazca's

head at this point just little bits I

see one sees that again she sniffles

again and like leans wistfully on Todd

shoulder alright yeah can I can I can I

pick up that I stock yes all right

yeah Strix is gonna pick that I don't

feel like I'll figure something else

there's gonna be something to stop these

stupid raises don't imagine yeah I'm

still kind of coughing you like trying

to wipe spores away out of his face

turns to the rest of the party you spike

all right we cannot mess with that guy

you just told that we were coming after

him yeah I told him that but we're not

gonna do anything what I don't think

he's the kind of thing to take bluffing

well

doesn't matter all I can do that

something out that's way smarter way

better to do because we can't do this on

we can't do this ourselves

more importantly did he threaten to blow

up the church he sure the spires he sure

did that kind of seems like something we

should take care of right now guys guys

guys guys

wait wait the guards are here right

someplace safe white we can continue

this discussion I need to show you

what's in my pants everyone's just

moving so fast in relationship is gonna

be frightened by that and then look at

the guards cuz the guards heard the head

talking right oh yes they did and other

other guards have showed up and the

sergeant's like what is it with you

people

oh I'm sorry but he's trying to blow up

the spires of the morning you have to

get there now make sure that everyone's

evacuated she will she will take her she

will do her utmost to get that message

across town would it take me what if I

be faster to get the message oh yes

definitely

okay I think we should I know to the

spires right now I don't wait hold on I

want to see what's in bin wins pants how

do you show us on the way you all over

all the guards are now helplessly

staring at bin wins pants yes okay Ben

what a dip you are obviously fine at

running so when you run and show each

other to each other's pants or whatever

and then evil and I will fly there yeah

you're right you guys get there

way faster the weekend bin when you and

I would talk along the way okay sounds

good cuz I need to show you what's in

right there how are so I know house

tricks is getting across town from the

North Ward to the castle ward where the

spires of the morning is located how are

the rest of you navigating the streets

strikes and evil and are flying together

sure yeah that makes sense yeah this is

a city secrets feature to go through the

back alleys to move there as quickly

as possible okay showing bid new in the

way yeah okay

but chances are he will arrive after

sometime after Strix or evylyn while

he's dragging been win yeah this they

get their way faster than me no matter

what yeah okay just want to be clear on

that point yeah

if it's mentioned that I could polymorph

or them into birds no all right fine

listen dick joke so you take off the two

of you with your your broom and your

wing boots and you head out over

rooftops you can see that there is a

Griffin Rider cavalry member circling

over troll skull alley who follows you

actually but at a respectful distance

tricks tricks will like zoom in and be

like Xander Thor's gonna blow up the

spires in the morning we have to hurry

okay and you can see as soon as you

clear the rooftops the spires of the

morning is an easy landmark to see in

the city because it is literally a

collection of towering golden top spires

nested together fairly closely that

gleam in the Sun and so you follow that

beacon straight there and passing all

kinds of folk below you some of whom

take notice of you particularly whenever

the broom backfires and ups the choking

smoke trail that it leaves in its wake

sorry I think even probably knows her

way around here pretty well I think just

like she's going for whatever entrance

to go to whatever authority figure would

start an evacuation well interestingly

enough as you get close so the spires of

the morning is situated on a plot of

land that has it's triangular with roads

basically enclosing it on all sides and

those roads are wide wide streets

boulevards really beautifully decorated

lots of phlegm spring flowers everywhere

the place is a riot of joyous color and

it's very clear to you is the two of you

approach that the temple has already

been evacuated because there are scores

of people acolytes and attendants other

members kind of standing out on the

roads a relatively safe distance away

from the gigantic edifice do I see

anyone that I recognize that will

require a percent

check because it's quite a crowd and the

crowd also includes members of the city

watch as well as what appear to be watch

soldiers with red capes that have

stitched into them in gold thread the

symbol of a golden crowned and you look

around you scope things out you spot one

person that you recognize in the clergy

her name she's a priest of Lysander

named sister and sin SIA she's in sin

SIA is she hails from you believe

northern Kaleem Shan she's got this sort

of absolutely she's this beautiful large

woman immaculate in her gown and her

headdress and she is standing with what

appeared to be kitchen staffers and

other people who work at the temple

would this have been like a superior to

even know as a priest she would she'd be

fairly high-ranking within the temple

but because Evelyn is a paladin of

Letendre she sort of stands apart from

the clergy so even will fly down and see

it's so good to see you

evylyn what's going on it has been a

while I'm so glad that we could see each

other again after how many years oh gee

I don't know

a good number yeah it would be real nice

to catch up except I think what's going

on is maybe there might be some sort of

bomb we were conducting our business

doing the renovations that father

sunbright has asked us to do and lo a

member of the Lord's Alliance arrives

with members of the city watch and tells

us we have to evacuate the building

immediately because there has been

a a serious threat apparently someone

has gained custody of a large quantity

of illegal smoke powder and rigged it in

the sewers underneath the temple yes

only because you hung out for a great

deal of time with a gift named

wardington month and he would never shut

up about the stuff it is it is a magical

black powder that powers that is

explosive in nature and is used in

something called firearms mmm likes

tricks has no my arms are on fire it's

different kind of firearms yeah well

what's being done to to neutralize the

threat

well apparently operatives either of the

Lords Alliance possibly the Harper's I'm

not sure which are going down into the

sewers to try to find these things

before they are set fire to and explode

I should probably go help evylyn kind of

turns to go and then she turns back and

she's like you know that that you know

rebrand that the temples going you know

that father-son bride ordered how do you

what do you think of that she says you

are of course familiar with the heresy

of the three faced Sun and I make a

religion check okay sixteen you do

recall what this heresy is and basically

the long and short of it what you're

able to recall the sixteen is

you were taught is the reincarnation of

an older God and that God's name was a

monitor or Amma not or and a monitor in

ancient ancient days back when there was

something called the nether another EES

Empire was worshipped by humans not only

as the God of the Sun but also as the

God of bureaucracy and the importance of

the steadiness and constants of

bureaucracy it was as constant and

predictable as the rising in the Setting

Sun you're not exactly sure why but a

Minotaur died coincident not there

shortly thereafter the Empire of natural

fell and it wasn't until Lysander was

reborn that there was a god of rebirth

and the dawn well the heresy of the

three faced Sun says that at some point

a Minotaur is going to rise from the

dead and retake his place in the heavens

and reclaim his portfolio over the Sun

and then split that portfolio up among

himself and two other hand-picked gods

who will then represent the dawn and the

dusk the sunrise and sunset and there

will be three gods presiding over the

domain of the Sun that is the heresy of

the three faced Sun this belief that all

Minotaur will one day come back and

reclaim his mantle and what makes it a

heresy that Lysander's not in that

within the Church of Lysander it's

considered a heresy to presume that all

Minotaur is a separate being from

Lysander right gotcha

okay so evens like of course I know

about the heresy of the three phase son

well father Luke sunbright believes that

the heresy is the truth and he is

gearing up the temple for Amma not

 return

evylyn would be opposed to this right

Lysander's technically in her mind the

reincarnation of a minute or so it's

complicated but but yes you've grown up

feeling your attachment tool offender

you have every reason to believe

Lysander is a real entity and i'm a

notic or is coming back then that calls

into question Lysander's legitimacy you

know i can't he can't be the real minute

or so that you would you would be

against it but you have already pledged

your support to father Luke son bright

would Strix know anything about this

having been from the plains you could

make a Arcana check eighteen yes so you

believe having studied the Empire of

nether all at some point in your

interest of magic and just how how

empires of magic come and go you believe

through texts that you read that ominous

war died because people stopped

worshipping him right essentially they

got they got so burdened by the brock

bureaucracy that his clergy had created

that they just couldn't stand him

anymore and so he lost his followers and

died and it is believed that his corpse

floats in the astral plane is a dead God

all right and people have visited that

corpse I just like to flutter just like

explode down there on my brew and I'm

just like yeah so ah daughters just like

a dead God floating around the astral

plane just so you know that also like

yeah I mean he died cuz people stopped

worship before shipping him also if you

stop worshipping Lysander he'd died too

so don't

then she takes back off I'll never stop

worshipping the sander of course not so

one of the the dawn Lord before she died

was as arrests says in sin SIA and

before she died was arrests requested or

put forth that her replacement should be

a woman named tourist an ad Aragon her

Aston is on her way to Waterdeep

from a distant land called Cormier

actually she's coming from the dáil

lands more precisely and even met the

rest before she met her and what they

understood me you read it you had heard

about Sir s because of her reputation

and I still don't remember her when

sister and Sen sia says the names

arrests something sort of resonates in

you like you do sort of know her or you

have a dim memory of her it almost feels

like a childhood memory mmm well her

asses face has got big shoes to fill

well she's not going to fill any shoes

if father Luke sunbright gets enough

support among the other priests and

solidifies his hold over the soon-to-be

temple of amun autor oh I think he asked

him me to support him in that and you

said it was it was a complicated moment

I don't worry I understand he can be

very persuasive

Oh in the event we shouldn't burden

ourselves with politics at this

particular time when the building might

collapse around your ankles I have a

tendency to get distracted my apologies

thank you so much ah Ben what do you

been when what do you pull out of your

pants I out the book and I sue you see

this book DF that's basically covered in

human it's stitched with human flesh

covers and inside you see writing in

blood in a script that you're

unaccustomed to a jagged harsh gothic

script it's creepy right yeah

and you found this deep within that

agency mm-hmm I found a secret door

hidden behind yeah that's cool found a

secret door hidden behind a black

cabinet full of trinkets and inside of

it was who

or crime in there to quote my friend Jim

dark magic it looks like someone killed

a man made of chili there was this

pedestal and there was a book on it and

I thought do you not touch that book

that is evil you dad would be the worst

thing to do and that's usually when I

grab things so I grabbed it and then

this the pedestal it was on came to life

and became a gargoyle and I was like

awesome a gargoyle to kill so I killed

it and then I shoved the book in my

pants I don't know what to do with it

but I don't think it was safe to leave

it there unless it's valuable then it's

totally mine it occurs to you Ben when

that you could probably find some place

in water deep to get it appraised yeah

yeah and flipping through the book

nothing in this is legible to me not

legible but you do feel its ghastly

nature quickly becomes apparent to you

in some of the diagrams and glyphs that

are worked into the text that suggests

that this is some sort of fiend

summoning thing as well as a a treatise

that can be used to contact otherworldly

creatures of the lower plains probably

recognize the writing as something strix

written as yeah yes yeah I thought you

could give it to your little weird

friend that flies on the broom we need

to get this districts but this is an

incredible fine bid when you did an

amazing job

thanks man put that in your pants why

why you in there says fill of trinkets

and other objects like Ezard like there

I had this conversation as they're like

they're darting through the streets and

like moving around keep one thing right

right right any any small objects or

anything in there that caught your eye

not anymore no one pays anything for

precious moments and Hummels anymore it

looks like they're really doing i

appraised my dad's it was disappointing

um

no from what I could tell it was just a

bunch of junk he got paid with so I

don't know maybe maybe these cat people

just liked little bobbles but when I

found the murder room I knew for sure

this was important they don't know that

enough but if the little bobbles seem

specific enough they alone could be

the summoning components needed for this

book we have to get there as fast as we

can

this goes way deeper than we can imagine

exactly what I was thinking

even you answer with our still with

incense eeeh and incense iya says there

there's the young man who alerted us to

the problem and she points to a tall

slim fellow with a little bushy brown

beard and disheveled hair but he's

wearing a red cape with the gold crown

symbol on the back and he's also wearing

a badge indicating that he's a member of

the city watch and although he's not

wearing typical rank of the city watch

looks like a pretty official person and

he's got two City Watch captain's

following him strict should we go down

into the sewers and try to help let's

wait until do you have been winged get

here and then we can decide it nothing

blows up or whatever maybe well let's go

talk to do I know this city watch person

really there's a lot of them you can

make a inside check eleven you do not

although that is high enough to remember

that you may have seen him at the awning

portal but he was being in obtrusive

shall fly over hey I think I saw you

once in the yawning portal sorry that I

don't remember your name hi I'm Evelyn

oh yeah that's me thanks pleasure to

meet you my name is Kjell astir

Silvermane Java ster so nice to meet you

I would love to get to know more about

you but unfortunately it seems like

we're in a little bit of an emergency I

wonder if you could tell me how I might

be able to help it well we think we got

everyone out of the temple but we're not

altogether sure we have agents down in

the sewers trying to find whether or not

there's a credible threat but we believe

that the threat is genuine just between

you and me we have a spy who delivered

this information to us and I trust him

completely

well I would say from what I've just

heard around from my spies as well that

that's true also

XANA thar told me this afar what does he

have to do with this

I think he's the one that put it there

interesting so the zanaffar might have a

large amount of illegal smoke powder

well that's what it sounds like to me

well you could do one thing for us with

your winged boots there and maybe make

sure that the temple is cleared out and

that no further danger or know that no

one has been left behind on it Strix you

want to come with me you're good at

searching little corners what okay

reconnaissance mission kinda Strix we'll

go up in the air and also use they'll

mature g2 just yell really loud if you

like oh oh like we will we will the

temples gonna explode everyone needs to

leave you're doing this outside the

temple I'm flying around it like in a

circle at the top so you can't really

see inside it of course but you can just

shout from the rooftops literally yeah

that's what she's doing evil and what

are you doing well Strix is shouting

down over the building I'm gonna go into

the temple and do like what do you call

that I don't know grid a grid by grid Oh

before you do that Strix is gonna death

Ward you okay you go in there and flap

yeah you're like I'm gonna go in there

and she's just like dope all right the

Yulin yeah just make a perception check

for me and I'm gonna give you advantage

because sound carries in the hollow

interior of the greatest temple of all

ready

even with advantage it's an eight okay

so you start to blaze around your little

wings flapping making weird echoing

sounds as you had from

chamber to cloister to antechamber to

narthex and you look around for signs of

anybody and the place is just completely

desolate and you're struck because you

don't remember ever in your life being

in this place when it was just

completely empty except for you and you

just sort of stop for a moment and

you're sort of in this beam of light

coming through this shimmering window on

high and you're just kind of alone for

the first time in this fantastic

structure with all these marble and

glass and images of Lysander and the

Saints who follow him gazing down upon

you lovingly and there's just this sort

of quietude that settles over you I

think the first thing she does is just

you know like you do when you're a kid

and you're in a big open space and you

go hello hello hello and then it strikes

her that this would be a really good

time to just you know connect with

Lysander for a second so she closes her

eyes and she's standing in this Sun beam

and she's trying to think of like what

she wants to say in a quiet moment with

Lysander and she's like hey I'm glad

you're around thanks for your help by a

voice greets you and says what

what for what how no answer and then it

says

with you there is great danger like I

bring danger to my friends

or I am in danger or I'm a danger to the

church hello hello hello hello okay well

thanks for the heads up she starts to

walk away and then stops and looks again

just see if there's anything else you

see the light down the cathedral it you

just see the sort of lances of imagine

if the Sun were moving outside and the

light it was making was sort of moving

down the cathedral in Ray's like like

you're just following like a ray will

strike through the temple and then it

will go away and then it'll be a little

farther down and be a little farther

down and farther down almost like the

Sun were setting very very quickly and

the light was tracking the length of the

Cathedral it's almost leading you she

follows it okay when you follow the

light you don't see it before you hear

it a voice saying be careful with it

vanitha Zanna Thor's and Thor's and

Thor's oh and then it says

oh I'm sky get it and then you hear

pitter pattering of feet creatures

taking off and you see what looked like

goblins sort of cross through the light

and scamper across the cathedral floor

and then they sort of catch sight of you

and disappear into the shadows and then

appearing in the 'kathy sort of coming

out of an alcove is a beholder with blue

with sort of a bluish coloured hide and

wiggling eye stalks emanating from one

of which is a beam that is holding the

statue of you in midair I hate that

thing the statue or the beholder

this the beholder is basically using his

telekinesis array to levitate the statue

of evil and that was in no I know but

she said I hate that thing I didn't know

smiles yeah I think she's talking about

that statue okay I was but you're right

it extends to both DF and bin when you

come out into the square around the

spires of the morning and see just a

massive throng of people near city watch

keeping them as far away from the

building as possible while recognising

that spectators will be spectators and

they want to be there in case something

happens and you see the gleaming spires

around which are these vapour trails of

black smoke left by Strix as she's

screaming her head off to get people out

of the building

bags okay so I see Strix kind of

floating up above and around yep

do I see evil in at all no Strix where

is evil and who shout and she strikes

you can't hear him there's just too many

people in the crowd and d/f she's not

going to be able to pick you out

hmm

we can hear her right oh yeah because

yeah she's flying around on a broom

using between our buyers and basically

using all kinds of crazy magic to

bolster her voice could the people that

we want to evacuate get out the way that

deivanai just came in oh yeah people

could bail and go down alleys and things

the way you came in but they don't want

to because they want to see what happens

if anything hmm or they want they want

to know it's safe to go back inside

they're told the building was going to

explode no no most of them were probably

told just get out of the building for

security reasons

we'll tell you about it later I mean

Strix is screaming explode

okay well now panic is starting to set

it among some people who might take this

crazy tiefling witch woman seriously and

some people actually say is she gonna

blow up the building is that what she's

saying well but there's there is a calm

here in the crowd there aren't there

aren't people freaking out yes death was

kind of start like shouldering his way

through the crowd to kind of get through

them and out front so you can like stand

out from the crowd okay

and trying to wave down straight you

could see a city watch guard comes over

to you and just sort of puts a hand

softly on your chest tries to push you

back into the crowd damn it hmm he says

it's dangerous please step back in misty

step

let's try to get past this guard and

then all of a sudden somebody in the

crowd shouts bid win bronze bottom so

somebody spots you in the crowd even

without your trademark helmet and

immediately you are surrounded by

adorers okay and dafuc been wind seems

to be pulling people to him like a

magnet and people are pulling out things

for Ben went to sign they tell him how

cool it was that the the Becca Hollister

fight was super awesome and thanks for

not stepping on my grandma's house and

you know things like that

can I I'm gonna use this commotion to

try to basically hide in plain sight and

use that to like kind of sneak around

their guards mm-hmm yeah you can make a

stealth check and I'll give you a

advantage yeah which man what a good

idea you just did didn't even know I was

gonna do it things like that just

happened you know I have the full pyro

background but I don't really know how

to use it all the time well there you go

27 all right you you disappear

effectively nobody pays any of mine to

you as you skulk you can pretty much go

ever you want and nobody seems to have

eyes on you good I just want to make my

way I guess come towards the building

and somewhere where when Strix is flying

around she can see me but not where

guards can see again okay as you make

your way toward the building you pass

sort of a group off to the side safely

away from the building but there the way

they're decked out catches your eye you

see father son bright he is dressed in

resplendent black and gold robes and

with sort of this beautiful symbol of

the Sun on them and he's surrounded by

paladins and golden armor obviously this

is their ceremonial put on for show

armor as well as several members of the

clergy that attend him and he's deeply

involved in conversation and casting his

eyes up at the spires to make sure

nothing has changed all as well and is

clearly waiting for City Watchmen to

keep him apprised of what's happening

but they're all too busy to care about

you you're able to March your way to the

building make your way around it's

strange

perimeter unseen to an entrance great

okay yeah disappear inside no I'm rather

I'm trying to get the attention of Strix

okay Strix make a perception check heck

that's not bad actually 17 okay you're

able to catch sight of DF are you racing

around the building I'm not seeing that

many people leaving anyway and evylyn

disappeared inside so I'll just zoom

I'll zoom down to him and be like oh

sorry I was so loud as soon as she zooms

down to you DF all eyes are on her so

they're now back on you whoops

but right where's evylyn inside what

it's okay I death warranted her she's

fine that's still gonna explode I know

but it should be fine and you let her in

there by herself well I was trying to

get people out so she told me everyone

told me to do please let me I'm not bad

you got the people love but we can't

leave her in there alone okay well then

we'll go in there then win what do you

do when you see these two over by the

building you can't tell what they're

talking about but now now they're

getting a little hysterical over there

and they seem very agitated people are

surrounding you some of them are much

taller than you so you're kind of

looking through them to keep the bearing

on your new friends so I got to get rid

of this crowd so I can so I look towards

the crowd and see if I can see anyone

wearing purple yes I point to them and I

say oh my god is that Jim dark magic

people all crane necks and look over

that direction Jim and they start to

look around for him creating what you

can see is an opening okay I split okay

okay some some adoring fan tries to say

like grab hold of one of your buckles as

you go past and kind of rips something

loose from your clothing you're not sure

what a little token and then and then he

just bounces up and down happily that he

got some memento that he just tore off

your body

I grab my pants and make sure it wasn't

me it was like it was like a back patch

on your on your okay basically just tore

a patch off as you make your way back

and I got a bronze bottom bottom patch

available at my Etsy store all right so

you charged DF and Strix and DF and

Strix you see Ben win coming for you

guys he stopped like twice to breathe DJ

what are we fighting that dead Christian

Bale from earlier so we gotta go find

her he lives a little inside alone for

whatever reason was she's trying to get

people out where's the door I have to

knock down no it's open it's fine uh-huh

I shut the door and kick it open okay

done evylyn you are alone in the temple

of Lysander with XANA thar who has your

statue your

stony effigy floating next to him look

I'm just gonna say it's a little bit

creepy to try to steal a big statue of

me I'm a beholder okay fair enough

what are you doing with that I'm going

to add it to my collection is that why

you're trying to blow up the temple oh

that was just a ruse for what reason so

I could take this but I needed to get

everybody out you threatened to blow up

the temple so you could steal that

statue of me pretty much

that's really weird

I'm quite okay well like I don't really

care if you steal it cuz like I don't I

don't know but I don't think you should

let you steal anything from the temple

I'm very conflicted like I kind of want

it to be gone you know

this is a very weird moment for me so

there's no bomb no okay I spy smoke

powder blowing up this place so you do

have tons of smoke powder a few okay um

well you know what

I was just wondering cuz I kind of

thought it'd be nice for you and I to

just like spend some time together like

get to know each other a little bit like

he fires an array at you what make a

saving throw

I can't even roll my perception or

persuasion for what I was trying to do

you've already he already is it he

already adores you so just make just

make one of them constitution saving

throws good I'm glad it's gone I'm sorry

just dexterity great 21 all right a 21

dexterity saving throw is enough as the

beam misses you she goes and she's like

look I was just saying I wanted to spend

time with you view send beams at me I'm

not doing it he fires another one

narrowing his central eye as he does so

this one's going to be a wisdom saving

throw oh man

12 all right you are charmed Dave I am

did I just get me holder roofies yeah

you got the whole so you you are

susceptible or under the effects of his

charm and while charmed you see him as a

wonderful friend they friendly

acquaintances you know he says

was weird before with you taking the

statue I think that's kind of sweet that

you want to look at me like that

yeah it's let's blow this joint go where

back to my place it's Underground and

far away from the city Oh

underground is usually not somewhere I'd

like but I've I think with you and be

fine I have a lot of Visine it's awesome

and he sort of he sort of turns his eyes

of the statute says won't be this and he

just throws it is it shatters onto a

thousand pieces on the floor

you're seem pleased

anything you do pleases me wait till I

kill your friends I hate this that seems

weird but I'm sure that you have it well

thought out alright the other three of

you you come skidding into the cathedral

or flying your broom as the case may be

make perception checks the three of you

jeez I got this don't worry that you're

prepared oops oh that's an at twenty

four Jared gnat ate this boy so DF you

here evylyn and Zenith are having a

conversation getting a little bit

farther away from you but not quickly so

oh that can't be good

that definitely kind of point down that

hallway and be like go go go and then I

said you're stalled and then he turned

to stone but it's still funny it's my

best joke so as you guys skid into view

you see standing near a hole that has

basically been disintegrated in the

floor of an antechamber a 30-foot

antechamber

is evylyn and the zennith are and the

Sabbath are going yeah

and they seem to be hitting it off what

the hell you're about 30 feet away and

the zennith are turns its eyes to you

takes on a mean countenance and says

leave us alone you know you guys

probably should cuz I think he might

kill you otherwise a me to do regret

seeing something uh I feel like I would

know evylyn well enough at this point to

probably perceive that she is not acting

normal

right yeah yeah I think you don't need

to make an insight check to do that yeah

Strix he has her brainwashed or

something oh by the way Strix are you're

not applying your perm are you so no

you're sort of running alongside them

yeah okay I you're are you holding your

staff yeah okay the lights on your staff

go out boy you sure Ken batteries I just

like hit it on the ground I'm like no no

no no no no it's tricks

no no nothing you can't do nothing's

working to count to ten I think we have

to go I don't know if you're still here

when I get to zero you won't be here

after that he's gonna kill us is it

obvious to bin win that evylyn is

charmed I have encountered a beholder

before yes I scream catchphrase and

throw a javelin at a center I Oh Mike

alright everybody roll initiative plays

an authority for it's fine I don't get

to resave against charm right uh you do

not cool

so but I'll have your roll initiative

anyway okay cuz you know this this dwarf

is attacking your good dear friend XANA

Thor yeah so we'll start with Strix I

got a nineteen death and evil in 1616

poems out here bin win funny yeah

alright so your javelin launches at this

beholder you can make your attack role I

think that Matt twenty all right so

you're jobless in a row that is never

having me playing Finn when ever roll

your damage okay I really don't want to

say this I really really don't then

don't ten it's a natural swanee it

doesn't matter and I would like to spend

a superiority dies to make it a pepper

bull beep a book pushing attack I I

really really really don't want to say

this but even standing next to vanitha

her good friend yes and she's definitely

gonna put out the mom arm for the

protection fighting style and impose

disadvantage on the attack role because

she doesn't want him to get stabbed that

was such a pretty attack I really don't

want him in a same team it's the rules

I I'm going to say that Ben win billions

initial attack was during the surprise

round oh good great so yes surprise

wrath so live by the rules die by the

rules with your with your natural twenty

the javelin races and

and sinks itself deeply into the XANA

thar's central eye causing it to explode

inward and then sort of expel all of

this horrific gore and you have never

heard anything scream as loud as this

beholder is screaming now its mouth is

just as wide as it can possibly be

its eyes just absolutely contorting

themselves in inexplicable ways and this

scream shakes the foundations of this

very structure and causes and and just

fills you've been when with with love

I'm gonna I'm gonna have to move this

book because there's no more room in my

pants all right and suddenly your staff

sparkles back to life straight I was so

scared I like shake it again it is the

Zanna thar's turn he goes first on the

regular initiative expect ones from me

for the rest of this evening and when

Ben win I would like you to make all the

saving throws start so first first make

a dexterity saving throw does anyone

have a mechanical beholder for me to get

[Laughter]

10 feet of me right

no he's farther away he's 30 feet away

from you I was I really do I rolled a 10

okay Ben Wynn has instantly turned to

stone for his second attack he

disintegrates been with Ben wind turns

to dust it's finally happened with its

third ray it turns it on

well it looks around and then looks at

you death and says who the are you

shoots you with a beam make a dexterity

saving throw

you're gonna weave I have a little PTSD

about Dustin boozers 27 okay so you

avoid that terrible terrible beam as it

races past you and doesn't hit anything

he hits like a column outside and you

see the column just kind of turn all

brittle and start to just crack okay all

right that's the B holders turn then it

is well it would be been win but bin win

is now a pile of dust I got a text Corey

and apologize Strix my text my business

partner sorry I just killed we can't

fight this no can you help evil in yeah

wait I'm looking he blends about 30 feet

away standing next to this raging

beholder with blinded main eye I need to

see something really quick I have ten

sorcery points I need to know if I can

make another six level spell slot with

them how much does it cost to get a

spell slot let's see I think it's it's

six oh wait you can only create up to a

fifth level can't you I have six level

spells yeah but you can only create up

to a fifth level spell slot using

flexible casting right no it's um it's a

sorcery point so I don't know I think it

is I well no I'm dead so I'm not playing

anything

yes yeah you can use sorcery points but

you can only create spell slots up to a

fifth level spells okay alright well so

I can't do that so how about

[Music]

hmm okay well I am going to cast

darkness on Santa thar okay so a 20-foot

radius or of impenetrable blackness yes

engulfs the Santa thar and evylyn yeah

and well and I don't and I'm going to at

the same time use my quick and spell -

oh I'm gonna just try and use my my

quick and spell - I don't know words so



- try and plug a polymorph actually I'll

try and polymorph the Sam is our first

and then I'll quick and spell darkness

on him okay

what is the sixteen okay wisdom sixteen

he's gonna save okay so that doesn't

work and I'm like balls darkness and I'm

like run okay do you want to run you

could have moving left

oh yeah okay this trick skedaddle 's

neck at the end of Strix is turn the

zenith are goes again it's in darkness

currently so it can't see it will

blindly fire it doesn't run by the way

Strix is gonna keep like looking back

and anyway it's a drive time to run it

will blindly fire another ray where it

thinks strict or where it thinks DF is

DF make a another dexterity saving throw

okay I'll turn at 20 all right again you

dodged the Ray firing out of the

blackness and it is evil ins turn yeah

you are you are charmed and of a mind to

stay to to accompany there's a Mathare

back to his lair but that doesn't mean

like I see the zenith are as a friend

but that doesn't mean that I think that

everything he does is great like I would

alright

we'll kill my friends right yes so

you're clearly torn right now I think

your friends are fighting evylyn I know

I think all evens doing is no stop

fighting no everybody stops oh she's

just gonna try to get in the middle

okay well currently she's in blackness

so can she move blindly toward what she

thinks is between absolutely basically

just kind of like stepping out in front

of the zenith are and like putting her

hands out and and you know does she want

to actually emerge from the darkness so

that she can be seen yeah I think so

okay so dia if you see evil and step out

of the darkness and put her hands up

okay

and she's like everybody just calm down

we can all get along is that all you're

doing Eglin yeah at the end of your turn

the zennith are we'll use another

legendary action and fire another array

@df but because you're in the way evylyn

you're the target instead hmm so I would

like you to make a dexterity saving

throw okay but I see if I get myself

killed I'm okay with that but if I get

the waffle crew killed by the way

hystrix still hasn't ran all the way

she's like hovering like come on come on

she's waiting for everyone this is back

season 17 okay you get out of the way

the beam just misses you and then it is

d D F you see the beam zapped out and

almost just FRA evil evylyn but she

somehow maneuvers out of the way she

playfully scolds the zammis are now you

watch those race he's he's still sort of

screaming in pain okay I try

does anything remain have been wind or

is it like his whole everything he's

being on it all just little dust play

don't worry about me good oh you know

just the waffle crew killing legendary

D&D characters you didn't kill me oh no

worden that was Chris I guess

technically technically his gear would

still be there so oh okay so it's like

in War of the Worlds when I just sort of

vaporize to dust the body but like the

clothes and just fall like the end

of infinity war yeah oh great so good I

don't feel so good yes d Ethel just

shout evil and he's trying to kill us

try to kill you look what he just did to

bid win as uh they would be real party

Thorin you've led focus think of

everything that's back there for you

that's not gonna work you know it cuz

she's under a magical compulsion I don't

I can't do anything else so are you

doing nothing else uh no I'm going to oh

god damn it Chris chad is axe asking if

since the zanna's are technically

attacked me if that breaks my charm that

is a fine fine question I mean I was by

the way so it yeah so I'm gonna say the

way you interpret that is it was a

mistake they wasn't targeting you damn

it and everything that he has said and

suggested suggests he doesn't mean you

harm so so thanks Chad for trying

yes we'll kind of rich will retreat in

the same direction as tricks but along

the way tried to grab one of bin wins

axes you could grab them both probably

if he wanted close they're close

together yeah I guess both they sort of

landed and sort of crossed each other

and just sort of are just lying

yeah you try to grab a grab those along

with a little bit of Bittman dust okay

just just to head out with it - because

I don't know if that's helpful for

resurrections or anything okay and then

basically try to leave the room and like

turn the corner it's such a place that

he's like hiding behind a corner so he's

got like cover or something okay and

strikes is just like bouncing like okay

time to run tiger okay okay and just

can't just can't just leave evil in we

can't die we can't save her if we're

dead

that's the point we can't save her if

we're dad that's what Paulson said and

he's probably drunk back at the house

and he's gonna be real I know I just I'm

gonna give her one moment I'm gonna give

her one moment to see if she could snap

out of it it's magic she can't get out

of here I'll catch up

no but please Rose arise another

beholder beam sort of randomly lance's

off in some direction and it comes back

around to the bee holders turn and

evylyn you hear him his screams becoming

more distant like he has sunk down into

that hole and is retreating back to his

lair wait for me all right and then it

is Strix astern Strix you hear evil and

say wait for me but I don't know did you

hear the screaming but it's becoming

more distant oh okay um can

you just spell it

I can't just spell it no I can't dispel

what he did

no but what I can do is

hmm I can do something different I'm

gonna use

I think it's could I use what could

alter my voice would prestidigitation do

that helmet RG okay

kinky polypore person well I'm going to

use Thal mature G to mimic Zanna thar's

voice and I probably wouldn't be fooled

by that because just a cancerous all

right then I'm gonna try them and peek

out and try and polymorph ur into

something they can't move like a fish

but also won't choke to death from lack

of water how about a snail Evelyn make a

wisdom saving throw I hope I feel I want

to be evil evil snails evilly oh oh wait

so plus my aura this is saving right

yeah yeah what kind

so Wiz dancin I think I'm still gonna

fail regardless cuz I rolled it - okay

oh there we go

alright so evil and turns into a little

snail Oh cute little yeah adorable this

little snail ever little like gold and

strikes you scooper up into your hand as

these anethe are screams of anguish

become more distant yeah yeah scuttles

over there and she's like six feet or

don't see what we backed up it was good

we didn't die see exactly been when he's

dead the snail is slowly trying to make

its way back to the samphire but you're

able to yeah is that book on the ground

that bin one had now got the book okay

good well if it sounds like it sounds

like Zanna Thor is like retreating out

of here and running that's what a sonic

I'm gonna try to collect up the rest of

whatever bid wind things are there is

important belongings I'm gonna get that

back to him okay and then we have to get

out of here this snail has a little bin

Windhelm

[Laughter]

okay as fast as we can like we need to

get evylyn as far as way from a far away

from their empires but can you grab the

snail and run and that's where we stop

for tonight ashes I got a handful of it

okay all right what's funny is that like

before we played tonight Corey was like

hey trying to find an opportunity to

need to come back next week you got a

buddy don't think he's gonna appreciate

what I choose ah hi we took out his anti

magic cone which was awesome yeah that's

kind of a big deal what's funny is um

people asked me all the time what would

happen if Ben wind died and I'm like I'd

be so happy I wanted to have like a

glorious death and it's D&D so yeah it's

never permanent and now now I don't know
