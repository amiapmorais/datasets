[Music]

you

[Laughter]

make a comeback because someone said

that we had we were due for a burro via

trip sometime soon and looks like we may

be going there hmm

I'm not surprised you can surprise me

anymore Chris Percodan no no you and

Rachel are both like that we did that

already yeah you know it could have just

it could have just been a technical

error you know like very similar

little glitch yeah so previously in dice

camera action paltin rescued

Evelyn's spirit ash into the sole monger

after she sacrificed herself to save

Strix and DF he pulled her from

obliteration as it were and was hurled

into a dark plane where he met this

creature made of twigs who gave him his

hand his severed hand of hell that

followed him around for a good long time

yeah and when this creature gave him the

hand

it told Halton that the hand would help

him find a chalice the Skull chalice of

chigga curry and Paulin thought nothing

more of it and eventually he was

returned to the Material Plane and he

left all that behind but he still had

the hand later the heroes ran into artis

Cimber an adventurer harper who had in

his possession the ring of winter which

he was keeping out of the hands of evil

sort of forcing himself to carry it

around even though he didn't

particularly want it now when palton saw

the ring of course palton wanted that

ring and he eventually got it

but not before artists gave him a

warning that he probably should never

have that ring not if he really wants it

around that time ish the party had to

bail

on their airship shemekka cut a deal

with dia in exchange for getting he and

his friends off the ship he had to

commit himself to being the subject of a

gayest spell which she cast on him that

gay is compelling him to seek out an

anti teen named mr. Fox and recover his

magical spectacles among other things

[Music]

last week paltin became separated from

the party and although it looked like he

had returned it actually was his icy

simulacrum and it dissolved into ice and

snow after impaling itself on Paul tans

sudden sword became separated quote as

in storm right then there was a nice

snow in you a moment as you all just

sort of gazed upon the slush pile that

used to be palton and when Simon offered

to take you to where palton was deaath

you felt this icy stabby needle through

your brain and you nearly collapsed from

the pain of it and then Holly you cast a

healing spell on him

so Holly I would like you to roll how

many hit points you give DF from your

healing spell yes please actually don't

have the clearance to guard if you're

casting it at its base level I believe

it's yeah okay yeah so I'll go ahead and

cast it in less he took like 25 points

of damage I think all right so you're

gonna do 3d eight plus your spell

casting ability modifier so it's 14 all

right so instantly you get some air two

points about

d/f and the pain begins to subside

doesn't matter what forget it so I guess

with that after Adeus had gotten just

super injured it's just like just

clutching his head because I believe

crazy we were last left off we had

basically said we offer on our way to

find paltin that's correct yeah okay and

Simon seemed to be of a mind to lead you

there okay yeah so death we'll just have

to say man actually clutching a very

real headache that I actually have right

now Chris Birkins you'll say I can't I

can't go you guys have to go fight

Bolton no no that's not happening

that's no no no we're gonna go together

this is a war teen you are to the party

no I'm saying I can't I know what I have

to do and if I don't do it I will die

no tricks you can make a Intelligence

Arcana check if you like

all right between screams yep okay very

concerned right now so you know that the

the game can't when he does anything

against that spell he takes the damage

but he can't take it more than once a

day

okay well that's good to know

that's fine I mean if he can oh if he

can take it once a day we can just like

heal them up once a day and we can go hi

Paulson and then you also you can come

back exactly you also know that there is

magic that could remove a gas like for

instance you think and remove curse

spell good do it oh I have that spell I

know you do

stammers like what wait wait so huh wait

if I remove the spell if I remove it and

but I really don't want to make but can

we still get some Eska the glasses okay

not sure we could just do it later

look it's fun you just removed the gaze

he just doesn't have the ice pointy

brain problem and then we just go get

the this stuff that she Mishka wants

after we go find paulsen to make sure

he's okay

do you think he's okay oh that's the

problem I can't deal with right now

remember all right so DF the reverse

will affect you if you are willing I'm

just saying we will still get the

glasses I don't want to make her mad but

there's no reason for you to be in pain

uh yes I am very willing okay

so nice she cares the spell you get you

get a sense DF that some that's been

lifted from you it's an intangible sense

but yeah you believe what a strange

thing that has never occurred to us

before just like if you're listening

we're going to still get the glasses

all right just she's like talking to the

air I'm just like looking around she's

talking to yeah we are going to get them

we just can't have DF die yeah this Trix

is right we still have to get it because

the last thing we want to do is do

anything that could possibly incur the

wrath of shamash go really don't want

that no she seems real nice I'm sure

she'll understand

she is not nice evylyn nothing about

this is night she's manipulative and

just using me like a puppet

well she dresses real nice Astrix comes

over to evil and is like evil and just

cuz people wear pretty dresses doesn't

mean that they're nice prettiest dress

of everybody yeah even kind of looks at

Miranda's dress and then looks up at her

like and then she changes it into like a

burlap

you have got to tell me where you got

that because I need one just like it

sure maybe to tell you something don't

worry about it

look Thank You Strix I feel much better

no problem well it's not to find it but

first things first we need okay Simon

leads you and by you that's including

your party Plus Miranda for surviving

betcha pygmies dragon bait and waffles

all on a merry escapade through this

maze like city until you get to what

appears to be a misty warriors graveyard

you can see it's sort of enclosed by low

walls and like the the the tombs in New

Orleans they're there all these crypts

that are above ground these box shaped

crypts laid out in this yard all around

the edges of the yard where the walls

sort of contain everything you crumbled

down masonry from toppled statues and

whatnot including several statues that

appear to have been carved to look like

minotaurs there is at the center of this

cemetery a larger tomb than the others

and you can see at once that it appears

to have been cracked open does it look

like it belongs in OMA or someplace else

I know it looks like it belongs you know

me all of all of the all of the crypts

are kind of a similar stone to the

ruined Omo and buildings around you and

based on the carvings on the sides of

the crypt is what sort of tips you off

that this some sort of warriors

graveyard because all the carvings show

what like stylized omen warriors

fighting stuff oh so the one the one

that's been open does it look like it's

been opened recently yes and would seem

so you can also see that engraved above

the opening that has been pulled

basically one end of this mausoleum has

sort of cracked and been knocked away

and now lies in ruins and above it

engraved in the stone in an ancient

language is a name of some kind

hmm can I try and and read it if you

have comprehend languages you can oh no

I don't I'm gonna pretend to read it

though okay

it's an old dialect you can you can read

everything what is it just like mumbles

oh I save strictest embarrassment in the

middle of that just by saying

evylyn can you sense anything oh let me

see Lord bless upon my servant with the

vision to know good and evil and all

that is around us you sense the presence

of undead all around you there are so

many undead here rolling like a whole

bunch see any of them you just sense

them but everybody roll initiative

except called me oh great well we'll get

to momentarily you know I realized this

week that when I'm in a situation that I

feel is like ironically dangerous I

immediately take a southern accent

without meaning to I wonder how that

happens

Strix Oh finally thirteen thirteen dear

also thirteen even fifteen and Miranda

fourteen alright no role for dragon bait

what come cute we all are together okay

so yes evylyn you sense that there are

there is undead all around you you count

in your brain it feels like like six

undead life forces and they're close but

you look around and there's nothing but

the graveyard and sort of the myth

that's kind of the morning mist that

settled over everything there is no

anything there's sunlight above you

through the fog that cherian so it's

it's a clear morning it's just that when

the river sort of crashes down through

here it stirs up a lot of moisture and

so the mist is sort of common washed

over this cemetery evylyn kind of walks

around like um knowingly she's petting

her chin and she's like if I have

learned anything in my time as paldon

fighting undead I've learned that

graveyards tend to be places where

undead are underneath the ground yeah

there's one about five feet away from

you

I can like hone in that quick back

closely yeah you can as you sort of move

close you can sense that it's really

close by and then it sort of moves so

that it's behind you oh so it doesn't

feel like it's under me no oh I think

these undead are invisible and she takes

a wild swing behind her all right I'll

go ahead and make an attack roll with

disadvantage oh man and I rolled in at

20 for my first one too literally had a

dream that I rolled in at 20 and I was

like lalala what a funny dream because I

never roll in that 20 and now the first

two rolls I have rolled since then okay

go ahead and count the ball you're next

and you've got you're using tree beam

right yeah all right so you swing your

axe around I should have used the

hardest spinelli but yeah I used but I

used to be okay um and if I quit that

means I'm adding another d8 right that's

right

yeah alright so I got something much of

using weapon two-handed then you're

adding your rolling D tens I I would

have but I didn't say it beforehand

that's okay she just was like no that's

fine okay that's great okay so roll it

d8 and then roll the d8 again and then

add your strength and what

yeah so I got eleven eleven okay when

you swing around you tear through

something it doesn't feel that

substantial but it's sort of like

cutting through like a curtain almost

for an instant there dude can I roll

some sort of like like I don't know a

religion or Arcana religion yeah

seventeen okay you believe that you hit

something that was insubstantial but

that it has kind of like a almost like

an ectoplasmic form it is invisible

which is why you can't see anything guys

we got ghosties all right and that is

Evelyn Miranda you're looking around you

don't see anything can I cast a real

quick detect magic I see any yeah with

you or detective magic you can see what

appeared to be hazy balls of light in

the air around the party can I see if

the one that if Ana hit one of them and

that's what that's that hazy ball of

light seems to be the thing that she cut

into okay um

Miranda's just gonna scream and start

pointing at them excellent okay um Strix

will be the radar stressin DF you're

technically going at the same time but

I'll start with you Holly what would you

like to do it'll be way more effective

I'm upset yeah I would like to fireball

the out of this entire area let's

just drop it at Ground Zero all right

exempting exempting all your friends and

companions the fireball detonates the

fog and the mist sort of explodes away

as the fireball pushes the moisture back

and roll your damage and I've got to

make 25 and these things are resistant

to fire so they'll each take twelve or

six depending on their saving throws all

right

the one behind Miranda you've still got

you

spell up that ball near evylyn seems to

just go away and engulfed in the flames

all right the other ones are all sort of

engulfed momentarily in the fire then

the fire passes and all the weeds and

stuff in the in the vicinity are all

burnt and charred away the mausoleums

and Crips are all sort of blackened by

scorch marks from the blast and it is DF

stirring I can't see anything

correct so Miranda is sort of pointing

to things empty spaces in the air all

right so yeah I'll take out gutter I

guess okay and then if she's like

pointing it somewhere do you like roll

with this advantage okay

[Music]

sixteen nope not there all right all

right

suddenly five balls of light appear all

around you they're no longer invisible

and you can also see around each ball of

floating light is just the barest hint

of a ghostly figure that looks like a

seven to eight foot tall Minotaur okay

oh and these ghostly spectral minotaurs

they're the ball of energy seems to be

kind of where their chests are don't

sneak up on us like that I'm sorry we

started talking to you but if you have

something to say just say it we're very

antsy and we're a little jumping evil

and you uh you rolled a seventeen on

your religion check now that you can see

these things you believe based on

childhood tales you were told at the

temple and whatnot that these might be

willow the wisps they are undead

malevolent spirits

haunt desolate places and tried to lead

travelers to their doom we ain't going

nowhere with you and these ones are

apparently Minotaur spirits but two of

them suddenly erupt with electricity and

fire bolts of lightning at evylyn look I

was holding back before but you don't

want to see me when I'm angry

all right evylyn you take 13 points of

damage from one brushes our shoulder off

and the other bolt you just sort of

block with your your BAM brace nice and

then two others will go after or two

others will go after Miranda Miranda

they're both going to hit you one does

16 points of lightning damage and the

other does 9 points of lightning damage

for a total of 25 and the last one is

going to go over and zap waffles yeah

waffles get zapped in the derriere for

13 points of damage and lets out a growl

and then you mess with me you mess with

my friends but you don't mess with my

album

alright dragon bait leaps into action

swinging at one of them with his sword

cutting into it twice and destroying it

is the most effective person here that

was singed by your fire

and then Simon will just sort of stand

there because he's not particularly

effective against incorporeal undead

creatures waffles will try to snap her

beak around one of them succeeding

actually oh so she kind of she swallows

where she appears to swallow it for an

instant and then it just sort of floats

out through her head yeah this one

wasn't damaged enough for her to kill it

and heard her attacks don't seem all

that effective then she'll take a swipe

at it with paw and hit it again

all right just a toy for her at this

point yeah I shouldn't Chandra pause

some time so she's got magic weapons

that'd be awesome

yeah evylyn what do you do as soon as

they hit my albear evylyn is like oh no

you did not

and she goes after the nearest actually

after the one that went after waffles

okay with tree bane all right and she

rolls sixteen that's a Miss and she kind

of coughs and shakes herself off and

goes for a second attack which also

misses okay she's very upset okay

Miranda you see four you see four orbs

floating around now are any of them

within five feet of another the two that

are attacking what you are both within

five feet of each other

excellent as soon as she sees the

lightning come out she casts call

lightning okay they're gonna make a

lovely deck safe so out of the sky comes

a bolt of lightning that it's the ground

they're good at deck saves actually

what's the DC sixteen okay one succeeded

in one fail eighteen Tony damaged okay

they take none of it they seem to be

immune to lightning mistakes were made

miss amazes me well okay all right

DF or sorry Strix Lindy Athens

all right I've been watching these

things for a while now so I can see that

at least they were hurt by my fire they

were so I will just drop another

fireball right okay I don't like to

crouch on the ground covering my head

all this happens okay

so when the fire and smoke clears you're

all crouched okay you are going to

obliterate all but one and that one is

one of the ones that was attacking

Miranda DF there's one left after strict

crouches down

I like leap over back and kind of like

so like she explodes goes down DF rolls

over her and like brings the sword down

into that one

that's a by Miranda okay that looks so

cool but strix is so sad oh no give me

some was that one engaged in combat or

was another say within 5 feet of that

guy Miranda had backed away from it yes

Sarah no fine fine you get your free way

you get your crit yeah how do you get to

it though

total of 11 okay that's gonna do it you

destroy it you pop it like a balloon

popping all right all of the we'll all

the Minotaur will ellipse have been

destroyed all right good that's why you

never mess with the albear and there's

sort of smoke coming off of everything

yeah

when I had used detect magic earlier and

I've seen anything in the crypts at all

oh that's in question um there was no

magical auras around the crypts Miranda

even if you don't one of you sense

anything else let us know just quietly

you see Simon Simon has you do not sense

any other undead or fiends in the

vicinity great Simon now crawled into

the tomb Simon no no you see his long

see his little feet disappear inside no

no good boy no that's a good place to

play no no and give Kyle like you know

she see a kid like walking too close to

a Ledge yeah it's like oh no yeah you

see him sort of crawl in

there's the door that was smashed open

isn't very big DF it's only maybe about

two feet square no problem for Simon to

fit in and you're actually pretty

slender you could fit in there yourself

and as you peer into the dark cavity do

you want to try to like grab him or

something to pull him out or you're just

gonna look inside just make a make a

strength up to try to grab hold of Simon

okay

athletics it is I love him okay yeah he

just sort of kicks you in the head and

crawls but when you kind of look in it's

dark in there obviously and you don't

have dark vision but there is enough

morning light coming through that you

can see there's like a rotted black

mummy stuffed in here and that's okay

and there's there's a horrible smell you

pick that up and this mummy has

deteriorated markedly it looks quite

quite old and very mouldy and just make

a perception check to see if you notice

anything else about it sure

16 okay from out here it's not easy to

tell but it looks like it's missing one

of its hands oh oh okay um I would like

to back away and stick my head out

towards evil and it's like evil in you

come here okay

Yulin dives in okay first thing you

notice evylyn is there is

the wretched mummy you can't smell it

because you don't have a sense of smell

but you do see it's pretty moldy and

when you go inside Simon's not in there

I imagine that even like is using her

wing boots to hang upside down with her

head inside looking around yeah she's

like did you lose Simon already he went

in here and then he kicked me and he's

gone I didn't see him leave

is there if she looks around there's no

exit that anyone can see no it's pretty

dark yes very dark and shadowy in there

it's possible he's hidden in some

crevice somewhere but just glancing in

there doesn't look like he's there at

all and you don't hear him rustling

around or being knocked around or

anything

Drex is still outside yeah yeah

Miranda's gonna cast a real quick cure

wounds okay great Evelyn Evelyn pokes

her head back out and says hystrix in

Miranda um Simon seems to have gotten

lost inside this hole deaath is uh

learning how to be a good babysitter I'm

gonna go down there and help him okay

wait Miranda perhaps you can see

something that we can't okay I mean I at

least have dark visions like the two of

you Miranda strikes you both try to poke

your heads in through this opening to

look around with your dark vision Simon

is not in the crypt at all

there's just the rotting mummy and with

your dark vision you can see that the

way the mummy is positioned it's one

hand is kind of over its chest but it's

all twisted and gnarled and it looks

like based on the way the hand is closed

in that it was it had been holding on to

something and you can tell kind of what

it was because the mummy is very soft

and mushy like Pete and whatever it was

holding in that one hand was tightly

positioned against its chest and left an

imprint of itself on its chest and that

imprint looks like a skull a reversed

out skull

I'm sure it's fine why are there's

always people strikes do you know what

that means do I know what it means

oh no buried dead people fine I mean

that seems reasonable to me

halten yes okay you have crossed over

into another world and you have that

chalice that the mummy was holding in

the crypt it is made of gold there it's

a gold-plated but it looks like it was

fashioned from a human skull that had

its top lopped off and hollowed out

interesting yes and it's gone

gems beautiful gems sediment it's a

remarkable piece of it's a remarkable

art object if nothing else but it looks

like a fancy fancy wine goblet that can

hold the skulls worth of wine it sounds

way cooler than this one actually and

you know or you believe that this is the

skull chalice of Chagga quarry which you

were told you would find with the aid of

the hand which was instrumental in

getting the Crypt getting you to the

crypt and getting the Crypt open your

your severed hand the body is still with

you probably parking on your shoulder or

hanging on to you in some other way

and you are in a forest there's no sign

of omou anywhere and this forest isn't a

jungle forest it appears to be sort of

dead Tim Burton like trees very ancient

it's like you sort of stepped over into

an Ingmar Bergman film it's all very

bleak and desolate cool and this force

looks like it's been dead an awful long

time there's a warm wind blowing through

the forest and what looks like a little

bit of ash on the air kind of blowing

through but nothing substantial but

there is kind of a smell just a bad

smell of rot that seems to pervade

this woodland and you've got the ring on

and it says I feel like I know which way

to go

well then lead the way yes I'm

definitely drawn to this place it says

we're gonna be so much happier here

paulten this is what I was made really

sand uh

where's that exactly I'm not sure I just

feel like I've come home and I'm glad

you could be with me buddy

me too man this is good yeah I think so

your friends are gonna come for you you

know that right I assumed as much

yeah but that's good that's good yeah

what why is that good well if we're

gonna make a we're gonna make a land

here to call our own we're gonna need

them okay these things don't just happen

on their own mmm fair fair fair fair

gotta distribute that labor yeah now

let's go this way all right let's go

okay so you'll go through this forest

for an interminable long time I but the

one thing you notice is that the day

doesn't seem to change there's no Sun

there's just this kind of grey pallid

sky overhead everything is sort of had

the color stripped out of it you're

about the most colorful thing here the

ground is dead the there's no sounds of

insects no sounds of birds no small

animals nothing in this forest the

ground isn't perfectly flat so you're

kind of going up and down and around and

around but he seems to but the ring

seems to know where it's going and then

occasionally it says north we need to go

farther north this is right is there

like a UH like an ETA on this cuz

in Aptus a while he says this land is

weird it doesn't have you can't measure

distance and time the same way you can

in the real world this is like a dark

reflection of the world but there's

there's no passage of time really it's a

timeless place you get that as much as I

can

I was made by elves you know there are

timeless people's yeah I had heard that

a few times

mm-hmm yeah so um let's just keep

walking in this direction all right

after you're not sure maybe hours days

who knows you do get thirsty so you're

drinking you're kind of wishing you

didn't leave Simon behind but the ring

said it was a good idea that you'd need

Simon to bring your friends along behind

you we can't wait for them here though

we have to we have to get on with it and

we have to move forward we have to get

to a place where we both feel

comfortable planting a flag putting down

roots and we're heading towards

somewhere that's more ideal for that

than this yeah yeah I mean look around

there's not much here it's just a dead

forest right

you want to live here for the rest of

your life I mean yeah this this doesn't

look like an ideal setting for forever I

guess I agree yeah okay uh all right you

know better than me oh we're team right

it's us together huh yeah but one of us

in the team has an inkling on where to

go right now so uh yeah but only cuz

I've been here before right Yeah right

so right then let's said carry on all

right after a fashion as your wine is

getting dangerously low

you crest this mound in the you see the

forest has starting to thin out and as

you make your way down and around and

the force becomes thinner and thinner

and thinner you see for the first time a

Riven scar through the forest that turns

out to be a road and on the edge on the

edge of the forest on that road you see

a coach like a carriage and the first

thing you notice is very dilapidated

it's sort of old and rickety and doesn't

look like it's in great shape but it is

intact and it is being pulled by what

looks like a putrescent ogre zombie one

of who one of its limbs has been chopped

off at the elbow and it's got a big hook

where it's missing arm should be and

it's got straps and it's it's literally

where the horse would be on this wagon

and it's just waiting there make a

perception check to see if you notice

anything else about this odd wagon we

pulled by a augers Amba that's about 15

you notice that the back is punctured

with all of these arrows or crossbow

bolts it kind of looks like a porcupine

it's got so many sticking out of it in

fact there's a couple arrow shots or

crossbows stuck in even in its wheels in

various places the other thing you

notice is that there is a man or a

figure of some kind peeing on a tree

like he's gotten out of the coach gone

off the road to basically have a quiet

moment next to a tree and he's kind of

singing to himself do I recognize him as

you make your way from tree to tree to

get a better look kind of poking around

trying to get a better look at him you

don't reckon you've never seen him

before but you've seen his kind before

he is a sort of dusky grey skinned elf

you saw though oviya and but this guy is

dressed a little bit better than they

were they were very much wild creatures

but this guy's kind of dressed in

Victorian garb for lack of a better word

but it's kind of old like his clothes

haven't been mended in a long time you

can see the frayed sleeves and they're a

little threadbare and the colour is sort

of washed out of them so they're not as

vibrant as they were when they were new

but yeah he's uh he's undone a zipper

and now he's just zipping back up and

you hear a voice from inside the

carriage a female voice eh

this is taking too long we did here

forever I'm gonna quietly ask the ring

like do you know these people no do we

that carriage yeah I don't know about

you but I'm tired of walking yeah same

you just like all right so it's like

should we do this

should we try and get a friendly ride or

do we just want that whole thing for

ourselves I guess we could try the

friendly approach okay

I'm gonna I'll walk out and I'll call to

him just very calmly very friendly it's

like excuse me fellow traveler I mean he

surprised at first they turns around and

zips up his fly in one fluid move don't

worry I didn't I didn't see anything

it's here you're good

scusa uh we are I've been walking I've

been wandering quite a while here and um

well long story short I could uh I could

use a ride you think you could help

someone else of course come on plenty of

room fantastic now I'm gonna like

quietly murderer he's like okay and no

DC look what I found

and you can see that a woman same dusk

elf dressed similarly to him she sort of

sticks her head out to coach and looks

over at you and she says hurry on now we

need to get going oh my gosh thank you

so that you you you two are Saints when

you come over to him he just puts a hand

on your shoulder very friendly and he

says don't don't worry about it I'm just

like oh okay personal space right and he

says after you my friend it's like when

you go thank you when you hop in you see

the interior the velvet lining and

everything is sort of decayed and

rotting and this this coach is obviously

old and decrepit but when you hop in you

sort of squeeze she sits over on one

side to open up an entire bench for you

and the two of them are now just sort of

sitting across from you and the man just

pulls the door shut and then he pounds

the roof and says Amy took you bambino

Grasso any and then he says and our

Avante and suddenly the whole thing

shows up shambles and it starts to move

and lurch forward so sorry guys headed

we're headed north you I believe I'm

headed north to a strange and the woman

you see that she's got a top hat which

is sort of fuzzy sat down next to her

and she says I am NOT EC Houdini and

this is Lavar dou provolone II we are

travelers like you hmm paltin very nice

to meet you you can see that Lavar dough

has not taken his eyes off your wine

flask he says it's been a long time

since we've had a drink how much wine do

I have left well you took the cask that

was on Simon's back so you have that

your current wine flask is basically

drained so you were kind of planning to

pour more from the cask you've got about

a half of a cask which is about a gallon

okay I'll uh be like oh well so it's the

least I can do friendos and all uh I'll

share okay yes he takes it and he says

cool he sort of makes a funny face like

it's not the best thing he's ever tasted

but it says I've tasted worse and hands

it back to you and he says but one must

never look gift cow in the mouth I agree

he says I feel better this is going to

be a good ride now mm-hmm I I agree you

can see that the woman has sort of

tucked behind her legs up against the

the bench that she's on a black leather

doctor's bag and it's just sort of

shoved behind her like she's not trying

to hide it but trying to keep it out of

the way and out of the conversation but

you sort of trundle on in this rickety

old coach great and then occasionally it

might slow down a little bit and then

Lavar des will just sort of punch the

ceiling and shout Amy took you fitori

adelaar they spree Gatti spree got E and

it'll pick up the pace again is your uh

I don't know too calm driver okay there

yeah he's a fine that's enough for me

yeah and then he just says yeah what's

the what's the word it looks at this

friend and she says look at the

Battaglia a battle cow and then you just

sort of ride on and occasionally Lovato

will extend a hand and ask you know get

some more wine mm-hmm you think he's

he's pretty deep into it I like this guy

yeah and he says nothing is free and

then he says when we get to wherever it

is we're going I'll make sure that you

are rewarded we have a few trinkets and

baubles we can part with

oh very kind of you and then you just

sort of sit there and there's a long

ride mm-hmm it seems to go on for hours

if not days occasionally punctuated with

one of them saying something or just

sort of nodding off and waking up with a

start they don't they seem to not really

not off they sort of go into trance so

they just become just sort of staring

off in a direction usually out a window

as you sort of look by you leave the

forest well behind and on hills and

things you see leering evil Buffalo

basically pulling up dead grass out of

the ground with their teeth and then

staring at you with glowing eyes as they

chew and that's all you see for miles

and miles and miles are these grazing

green eye - buffalo I'm gonna ask them

about them like Clara what's their story

and there's a bit of warm wind that's

buffeting the coach and they sort of

look we never asked them says Lavar doe

that's fair I'm gonna after that movie

like hey uh was was named Ian levar doe

levar doe like mr. provolone where

exactly are we you are in a place called

the shadow fell ah I see

this is all home that's what I hear here

it's a lovely around these parts really

really ideal place to settle down

I suppose okay and you travel a long

time and then you hear a Nuri see there

DC Anna she likes to be called say she

just sort of stares out a window and

says it'll Dolce Far Niente

come again

oh nothing it's good to do nothing

uh-huh can I am I able to communicate

with the ring like telepathic like yeah

yeah okay I'm just gonna ask it like how

how much farther do you think we should

go or we still doesn't still feel like

we're going in the right direction

mm-hmm yeah we're definitely headed

where we need to go okay definitely be

feeling drawn in that direction boy I'm

glad we don't have to walk and the less

these people say the better mmm bear do

we feel significantly closer or well we

still got a ways to go

cool well at least we still have wine

right yeah that's good all right all

right cool all right so you begin to

drain the wine you get down to a quarter

cask and then down to 1/8 cask and

there's been no change in how long the

day is gone but it feels like you've

spent hours and hours and hours and

hours and hours with these people and

sitting on this bench it's becoming even

more painful and the bouncing around and

the jostling around occasionally you do

you feel like you do have to stop at one

point and actually relieve yourself ok I

guess so I guess I'll ask if we can take

a little take a little pit stop yeah Amy

talk you brood about betta stop

and suddenly lurches to a stop you hop

out you relieve yourself somewhere

they'll get out as well and just sort of

walk around she will just sort of fan

herself with her top hat and he'll just

sort of stretch I'm gonna I'll ask

awesome ring like so now that we're out

do we need anything are we still just

wandering it's been a while yeah you

just see this road meandering off toward

dusty sort of Canyon like landmasses and

then far far beyond those you can see

jagged pointed mountains but it feels

like you've been staring at those

mountains forever and they haven't

gotten any closer he says or the ring

says we'll get there eventually we just

have to make sure we don't well

you don't starve

all right I guess I guess I guess we're

good to get back on the carriage then

yeah keep it's muscle they might know

more about how far it is than I do who

says the ring mm-hmm and eventually you

do get back in the carriage and you

trend along with them and they're all

they're both very quiet they sort of sit

there staring at windows or staring at

their hands they don't seem to be

terribly concerned about not having any

food do you guys you guys don't have

anything to eat on here do you

I know no but I hope we find a place

where we can stop soon and rest there

and she says I do remember coming by

here or what about 30 years ago 35 I

think there's a tavern somewhere on this

road we'll keep our eyes peeled okay

can I like perceive anything fishy I

make an inside check okay masa for nope

and one point you don't notice anything

fishy but at one point

Lavar dough does ask you so where's the

rest of him

and he's pointing at the hand oh do I

know yeah you know having crawled

through the Crypt that you had found the

mummy of chicken chukka curry to whom

this hand belongs so you've left him

behind

there elsewhere all right going back to

the rest of the party what do you guys

do so this team has been here for a

while so it does have like a fine layer

of dust or cobweb or anything similar

inside yes okay I look around for any

kind plots of black mildew - yeah well

look around for recent footprints or

signs that someone potentially went

inside of here that wasn't myself Simon

or the others I'll poke at the corpse

okay make your wisdom survival check to

check for tracks DF and I you poked at

the corpse strix it has been dead a long

time it's soft and mushy

dad it appears to have had its internal

organs removed that's for the injures um

any of the walls you don't see any

evidence that they're with the corpse

survival's 16 with your 16 you do see

evidence that maybe palton crawled in

here okay am i able to tell where he

suddenly was also see that a little

handprints from the fingers of the

severed hand can I tell or see where

like these tracks suddenly stop stop

near the back of the crypt okay

okay strikes

you don't magic pretty well by red as I

answered my arms are fully in the corpse

just like grabbing inside of it like I

don't feel anything

the organs are gone right what did you

want

do you can you is there like a portal or

something here or maybe I stop there be

secret don't stop you right there Jared

Strix Jared just sort of stop or D s

start stops talking in mid-sentence okay

oh no oh no when you turn toward him

he's not there

what oh he said portal I heard the word

portal right

oh there's probably a portal it likes to

stand exactly where death was he starts

looking around it's probably search will

take her arms out of the core plates

yeah when you when you see as soon as

you see even storm passed you Strix to

go toward the back of the crypt for an

instant she's there to sort of gleaming

in what little light is filtering in

here and then you sort of see the

shadows come around her and she's gone

[Music]

[Laughter]

I'm just saying now's the time to just

go like you can go make some money in

port nines are oh you can pick up bodies

there's so many things you can do I

would go except that this ring is super

dangerous and I kind of feel like it's

my fault so all I'm saying if you you're

barmy to come over here by and I say

that as I walk towards I use my flowers

to make a flower and I put it on the

corpse and I'm like I'm sorry she had

your hands in you and doesn't follow

Strix

okay so beeps tricks um before you head

in after your friends I will point out

that dragon bait and waffles are still

outside oh that's right okay that's

right or Emily

that after I walk hold on I like hustle

back outside and look at Dragon be like

dragon bait have two pets it again

because we have to go through a portal

probably someplace really bad if you

need to like what I understand if you go

to point down into port nine zero you

can start busking with waffles like

really she'd be great for making money

and like I'm just saying we're not no

we're not leaving dragon bait as I hear

Evelyn's voice in my head going were

leaving her all right dragon bait smells

like sadness he smells like roses

actually but he he sort of gives you a

nod of understanding Tom will fight up

you nice yeah we'll be back

oh well bring you a present we'll bring

you a present I want to leave my venture

pygmies with dragon bait and be like I'm

sorry you're babysitting more kids but

no I don't want them to die and she just

kisses them on the forehead in the mix

the cripton is gone some snacks okay you

dumped some snacks out yeah these are

for waffles she gets one in the morning

and one in the afternoon and then I'm

just like I'm so sorry dragon B I really

hope we could do something nice for you

but like honestly we're just a mess and

she's alright so you disappear into the

Crypt all of you have at various stages

first D F and Evelyn then Miranda then

Strix now emerged into a dead forest

Strix comes out and then like nobody

else comes out I'm like our waffle sand

dragon I coming no no don't they're

staying okay look evylyn animals back

animals shouldn't go through portals

it's just over this is a rule that we

have now and then waffles comes through

[Laughter]

and when creatures sort of appear here

they don't just sort of bamp up here and

fall out they just sort of they start

off very almost ghost-like and then they

just fully materialized where they're

standing so it's like they become solid

so she just sort of materializes near

you but then is instantly frantic and

looking around making sure like counting

you all off it

evylyn jumps on her back and gives her

like a bear hug with her arms and legs

and buries her face and her feathers

he's like you would never leave us your

girl and she's like give her a nice ride

scritch and then wasn't having it

we'll go to where everyone else appeared

and just to see if there's a way back

like can I go back through here when you

sort of put your hand in the general

area you just sort of hold it there it

does become kind of translucent oh okay

good to know we should remember this

place because I want to go back yes

absolutely

yeah the other thing you notice I'm

reading them around is there's almost

nothing distinguishing what this place

is you're just kind of in the middle of

this dead forest so you feel like you'd

have to mark it or something it's not a

place that looks at all familiar to me

no it does not

although now that you've seen it being a

druid and kind of knowing the shapes of

trees and things that you would be able

to find good about almost nobody else

could I know

I'll draw little sons on every tree that

we pass and then we'll know how to get

our way back make sure that what you

used to draw on them is biodegradable oh

yeah I I turned my staff into a broom as

this is happening I'm like I'm gonna go

see where we are perhaps we could find

our way around or back in our first kid

weight back in college

yeah EF will try to start making

haphazard masters kind of markup Strix

goes off and works around all right so

Strix you explode up into the air and

when you look around you can see there's

no sign of omou there none of the cliffs

that hem the city in you're just in the

middle of this dead forest that seems to

go on forever all right but but off in

the haze you can make out what appeared

to be canyons and other distant features

and far far far far away through the

grey lifeless landscape you see jagged

peaks

both to the north and the east and to

the south of you can I do it and I guess

an Arcana check to see what plane we're

on certain every 124 all right with that

roll and you believe that you have

crossed over into the shadow fell all

right and what you know about the shadow

fell out may hear a scream do the plane

of shadow a dimension of black gray and

white where most color has been leached

from the world it is a place of darkness

it's sort of in addition to its

colorless landscape you can see a lot of

its features tend to be twisted and

warped like distorted reflections of

what you would find on the real world

and you also know this is a place where

undead reside primarily as well as other

creatures of shadow this is also where

domains of dread are born all right I

fly back down put my broom down and then

I turn it into the owl bear doll him I

hold it close to myself

overall bear doll I say this is the

shadow fell this is a bad place we need

to leave are we gonna go after your

friend I'm just say we need to leave as

a reaction that's just it it's like a

tick of mine we're not actually leaving

yes we're going after our friend and

we're all gonna die well I don't know if

palton even wants to be found but we

definitely need to find Simon okay

actually Simon hasn't gone too far

he sort of walks back toward you now

that you're all here oh good and he just

waves

now Simon uncle TF is not very good at

looking after you you have to stick next

to him otherwise he's gonna lose you I'm

not as uncle uncle des says he's sorry

for losing

he's definitely his uncle dang it all

right Simon if you know her paltin is we

gotta get you back to him so why don't

you show us where he is

fast as possible okay they'll begin

walking off

are you sure that Colton wants we found

shouldn't we just take Simon back with

us the reason that we're finding paltin

is because he has an evil evil super

evil ring and we have to get it off of

him which is why we're here in this

super evil place this is the kind of

ring that if it's in the wrong hands

which I assume it is right now it could

um cause a lot of problems for everyone

not just for your friend but for you and

me and everyone you love maybe he's off

doing good with it mm-hmm I'm not sure

what's going on but I do think he wants

to be found

India's actually point at the Sun sword

that Evelyn is carrying huh if he didn't

want to be found he didn't want to give

miss that he wanted to be found or just

the green want us to find it I'm not

sure I think even maybe subconsciously

if he is beyond beyond his own power and

it is just the ring he wouldn't have

given us that she would have kept that

weapon for himself there's something

here and we have to go after him

paltin your ring now has 20 charges um

and it says it says to you

telepathically while you're writing this

coach you know we artists had me he

never really wanted me and the same can

be said for a lot of my past wearers but

you and I it's to be together well I was

a fool I was given amazing power and I

feel like for the first time there's

somebody who has me who can actually use

that power

I'll just goes oh so sweet

hmm I think I also know who these people

are mmm I think they're shatter Kai

do I know what that is no I don't know

what that is

they're elves who retreated to the

shadow fell and became touched by its

despair okay so does that mean anything

for us cept I think they follow a elven

God called the Raven queen she seems

important somehow it's pretty cool

sounds cool it's like do we do we have

issue with that yeah okay it's like I

just want to just want to make sure we

have a game plan for once we're off this

damn oh yeah I think once we get to a

place where we're both comfortable we

should wait for your friends there hmm

and then kill them and when their blood

is spilled upon the ground we'll use it

to make a safe land for us where no one

can ever separate me from the one to

whom I belong again how Chris how do i

how do I feel about this oh um you feel

a little a little twisted up about that

I'm going to allow you at this point in

time to make a new saving throw well

against the rings hold over you if you

so wish if there was ever a time for an

eight twenty it is now it's gonna be a

one we had 220 just just a d20 just the

d20

so that would be a five if evil in near

me and your presence in your present

conditions under the Rings influence you

think that this is this is the this is

the best way to proceed they're going to

chase you forever if you don't put them

down and you don't want them chasing you

forever you think that would be bad for

them and bad for you mm-hmm but you and

the ring can plant your roots the ring

then says you know as soon as you put me

on I knew that there was something about

you that was special something about you

that ties back to this place that binds

us together it's like we were always

meant to be together here in this place

don't you feel it

and you're like yeah okay I'm just like

no one has ever said anything so sweet

to me this this is why we work and then

you hear Muricy say Fenella me sorry I

told my microphone you know yeah all

right she says vanilla mint day and and

then she says to me Toshi meathook

tamari and meathook comes to a stop and

she sort of cracks the door open and you

all kind of peer out and you can see

you're kind of cresting a hill that goes

down the road splits forming a why ahead

of you at the bottom of the hill and

there are hills all around this

crossroads and perched atop one of them

is a dilapidated tavern

ah finally thank God yeah and levar Doh

echoes your sentiment and he says

meatball you borsa de mierda

onward and then trundles forward and I

think at last we have arrived somewhere

where we can rest our feet and our butts

and get some drink in us hmm but I was

resting my throat is too dry agreed very

much so and and then he looks at and

Nareesha and says no Goliad you and they

seem very happy and then their happiness

sort of fades very quickly and they're

kind of morose but you come to a stop

you sort of go up this gravel dusty

driveway to this in you can see hanging

from the in the in itself looks like

it's in great disrepair that it's it's

fallen onto hard times it actually looks

abandoned when you first see it but then

you can hear voices inside and smell the

scent of ale wafting out through its

open windows and doorway but you also

see it tied to the eaves of this

ramshackle wooden building which has a

turret on one end are these twig glyphs

glyphs that have been made out of twigs

that hang from it like protective wards

do I know what those are you can make an

arc on a check oh that's ten you think

they're protective Ward's so you don't

know what they might do if anything they

might just be totemic symbols or meant

to scare off travellers or

being innocent like a jack-o'-lantern

but they just hang from all the eaves

and just sort of twitch and move in this

in the breeze as you pile out of the

wagon meathook gives you a somber

dead-eyed look he doesn't seem tired at

all it's just this sort of the way his

flesh kind of hangs off his body is

disgusting and it sort of created this

kind of perpetual frown on its face and

then when you look around below by the

crossroads on lower ground you can see

there are these old crow cages hanging

gonna I asked the ring just like do we

like this place is this is this the

place yeah this is good yeah okay

as long as they've got all the ale that

you can drink that's all we really need

right I guess so all right you can see

that as they come out of the coach

Lavar dough helps Narayana down and

she's got that black doctor's bag in her

hand and the top hat on her head and she

just sort of looks around smells the air

and it's kind of all dreadful but she

looks at the end and makes her way

toward it and Lavar dough stands next to

you and says yeah that wasn't so bad

oh sure a bad worse I'm gonna ask her

like so what's the bag are you sure you

want to know of course you do and she

comes over to you and she'll open up the

bag and you can see that it contains

what looks like almost like flaps or

pieces of leather all sort of piled in

there but as you take a closer gander

they're all carved off faces oh oh

inside the bag on the inside you can see

sleeves where she's got all these knives

oh so you do leather work

and lovara says nannies IANA see if they

got some beds and drinks for us my

friend Paula toll here photo come with

me mmm and he takes you back to the

coach and steps inside briefly and he

pops up the bench that you were sitting

on and it's hollow underneath it's got

like a compartment and it's full of gold

and trinkets

oh and things also that's been here the

whole time

see we are collectors of trinkets and

memories and in the rasayanas case faces

the more the trinkets in the memories

right can I ask about the faces or is it

the less I know the better he says you

don't need to worry about that we're no

threat to you my friends hmm that's

enough for me then but if you're really

curious ask Marie Siana she likes to

talk about her work was good she found

good she found something she likes I

mean what's the thing about you do what

you love carving up faces you never work

a day and you're something I don't know

anyway what were you saying I've never

heard that expression before mm so so

anyway you were talking about this bench

yeah so he says is there something that

you would like some piece of jewelry or

memento or something to remember our

journey is there anything that

particularly high in there

there's so much oddities and stuff no

but if you were just sort of dive your

hand in and pull something out maybe

you'll get something sure all right roll

percentile dice 2d tens one tens and one

ones and I'll see what you what you okay

so let's see

seven to 72

all right you pull out a what appears to

be a silver tear drop earring and the

way glitters and Sheen's

it's like a real teardrop kind of frozen

on the end of a hook basically like it's

sort of magically suspended they're neat

like is there a story behind this yes he

says that eath was a gift from a

grandmother to a granddaughter great I'm

just gonna put that in my pocket save

that for later

all right back with the other party

members as Simon leads you down through

this thing you begin to feel despair

creep upon you even I mean it's usually

there it's usually there I would like

Miranda

Strix DF and evylyn to each roll a d6

some sort of like protection from this

I mean despair is kind of like being

frightened it's not it's not the same as

fear I fail I roll a six okay I rolled a

four four I also rolled six six okay all

right so

evylyn your despair begins to manifest

as kind of a form of madness

obviously this is true for DF as well

cuz you both rolled sixes that so

you have disadvantage on ability checks

and saving throws that rely on

intelligence wisdom and charisma so your

mental stats basically thank God that

wasn't me our advantage and disadvantage

on ability checks and saving throws

against your mental stats and you both

gain the following flaw I can't tell

what's real anymore okay Holly this is

our perfect restricts

Strix is despair manifests as dreaded oh

oh great this isn't actually much of a

stretch you have disadvantage on all

saving throws and you have the following

flaw which I think you have already I am

convinced that this place is going to

kill me I'm already convinced I mean I

can turn it up by like a 25 so you just

dial it up basically and Miranda you now

suffer from apathy you have disadvantage

on death saving throws and on initiative

checks and your flaw is I don't believe

I can make a difference

to anyone or anything okay welcome to

the crew and just to check on waffles

because she is not immune I don't want

to say at waffles

she can't tell what's real anymore

either also partially true already yes

it is as you are beginning to lapse into

despair and you don't know how long

Simon has been guiding you through but

the force has begun to thin and when you

get toward the edge of the forest you

see a road

for the first time a gash across the

land and parked on the road no it's not

another coach with another meat puppet

I'd be crazy you see an emaciated

grayish black horse with a rider on it

sort of cloaked all dressed in black

except he's wearing a burlap sack over

his head with eye holes cut out of it

and he is standing on the road I'm sorry

he's mounted on the horse at the edge of

the forest

it's just waiting look it's the

embodiment of our despair can I use my

cloak to imitate the hood the burlap

sack mm-hmm

no because it's a separate thing your

cloak can only turn into other kinds of

cloaks okay

but you could do a cloak that has kind

of like a burlap coward yeah yeah I'm

gonna do that all right

doesn't matter Rick's is gonna run up to

the run up to it with their staff on

fire going okay ready run toward it with

your fiery staff the horse and the rider

do turn to you and you can see the

riders got a sheaths long so tied to

obviously his looks definitely a man by

in terms of his shape and form but he's

wearing black gloves black top black

boots black everything just the gray

burlap sack over his face and he says

are you no okay

he's just barmy it's fine death is uh on

the ground like grabbing the dirt of the

road and like picking it up and kind of

like looking at it like sighs I'm in

trouble fast

Simon is real we're following Simon

evylyn is standing next to Strix like

that whole time when Strix was talking

to him she just kind of slowly walked up

to Strix and she's just like this close

to Strix his face she's being like he

asks you Lord Niall asks you pulled by

an undead no I don't believe you

just ignore them but everyone here is

going barmy but I'm already barmy so I

guess I'm relatively fine opposed to my

assassins in it

that sounds bad they attacked my estate

I'm sorry

Lord what's under there in your sack you

have a face under there he pulls the

sack off and you see his face has been

shorn off that's not real it's just this

bloody mask with his eyeballs so doesn't

matter but the face has been caught off

him nope

you sort of go over to him to sort of

touch him and you're gonna say that

you're gonna try to cure him or evil am

i all call evil own over I'll be like

evil and don't look but you can fix his

face by laying on hands

don't say that his face is not his it's

not nice to say no more trying to be

nice to these tell us so just lay on

hands a couple points for him

she just kind of likes like puts her

hand on his knee and she's like sorry

she lay on hands is on him yeah he'll

actually take off his glove and hold his

hand up to you when he does that she

takes his hand and just like smiles I

haven't strokes it all right how much

healing are you giving him start with

just like ten okay because it's not

regeneration

it is not regenerating his face

but what it does do is it removes the

injury and it kind of makes his faith

his face less of a bleedy but he's still

horribly horribly disfigured but he says

he's gotten the lip so it's hard to talk

no no cutter is gonna walk around in

pain and without a face I learned that

back back home okay now he one's

nuzzling the horse I think we're going

in the same direction

maybe we're following assignment going

the same way as the as the wave is

any actions personnel okay she's just

literally like as if as if she were

back Miranda okeydoke

Nathan when palton goes in you can see

that this ramshackle tavern is up and

running there is a man behind the bar

who's sort of a decrepit old guy and

he's already pouring a drink for an

array Siana who went in first and is

happy to do the same for you

great Leonel we're good you also know

the sign outside this establishment is

says the dead-eyed drunk huh

relatable so I'm gonna sit next to her

there's nobody here you and the to

shadow Kai and the barkeep I'm gonna ask

her like so what's up with the faces

Navarro and I collect trinkets and

memories from people and he likes shiny

things and I like these faces they

remind none of the people that I've had

to kill it's dirty work but we all have

we all hold onto things to keep our

sanity cutting uh cutting people's faces

off to keep sanity okay um sure you know

don't knock it till you try it right she

will share her drink with you didn't he

pour me one no he did like oh I have one

thank you though she'll take hers back

wait what she'll take hers back Oh hers

I thought yeah fine okay

thank or so where where do you head from

here I am not sure we'll probably stay

here for a little while

are you planning to stay for a little

while when she asked me that I uh

telepathically as the ring do we plan to

stay here for a while

yeah this seems like a good place to

meet up with the others when they arrive

yeah we might stay a bit I'm sure I'm

guessing these two could be useful to us

they seem to have some skills

how uh how long did you guys plan on

staying time is such an ephemeral thing

particularly for we-we-we who don't age

mmm

it's not like we have any where we need

to be you know whether I was about to

talk about my assignments but there are

some secrets that we have to keep

ourselves suffice to say we're here for

you punko that is so sweet of you guys

everyone here is just so nice and

accommodating this is good this is a

good place if our dough will stop be on

the back and saying let's play a game

okay

let's start with the stop hitting me

game fair enough you like drinking games

I hear I'm just like yeah let's see

which of us can drink the other under

the table I like you this is good

oh he'll but he'll tell the barkeep keep

the drinks are coming and then he'll

take you over to a table and plop his

drink down okay and then he'll grab

he'll actually reach behind the bar and

grab some shot glasses mm-hmm and later

good man and then I'll set them all up

on the table so you got like four in

front of you and four in front of him

and then it'll go back over to the bar

and he'll grab a bottle and he'll start

pouring liquor into the glasses and then

put the bottle on the table so are we

playing for something or is this just

for fun we should make it interesting

all right what do you have in mind

name please

you first game was your idea he sort of

looks at you and he says

Bellavista I know

loser gets his face cut off hmm what

about the what does the winner get

anything aside from keeping their face

seems like a pretty good win for me and

for you with that you can scenery see

Anna over at the bar she's opened up her

bag and pulled out a scalpel and just

sort of sets it on the bar just like

yeah I wanted I'm gonna mine speak with

the ring really quick like do we want

their help for when the friendos show up

yeah it's like all right how about this

if you win you get the face

but how about if I win you help me out

with something anything

Namath I've got some that I'm meeting up

with Oh at some point if you don't have

anywhere to go if you don't it's know if

you're nineteen eighty kind of rush

maybe they'd be stick around and lend me

a hand you already have put I think your

fans yeah that's true at one time you

can see Anna Ricci Anna has sort of she

gets up she comes over to you and just

sort of drapes herself affectionately

over you and just replaces the scalpel

down on the table and says our knives

are your nice what do you say llevarlo

he says of course let's do it I'll do

exactly what you say it will help you

with your friends if you in alright

let's play all right here are the rules

you can take even without having to make

any Constitution checks you can drink a

number of drinks equal to one plus your

constitution modifier which for you Paul

pen so you can get three drinks down and

never have to even worry about making a

check mm-hmm

all right the good news is Lavar dough's

in the same boat so as you are taking

drinks and this liquor he's found is

potent stuff you get the first three

down and you're starting to feel pretty

darn loopy after that but after that on

the fourth drink and beyond

we need Constitution saving throws okay

no so and you're not near evil and this

is alright sorry I'm not saving throws

it's a constitution check and these are

contested so

no wait that's some right yeah there are

custard center so make a constitution

saving throw okay he has to make one as

well it's not hard so the DC is ten how

did you do

sixteen alright so you both drink the

fourth one you make it now you're on

your fifth drink the DC is eleven 1608

seventeen okay you both make it on your

sixth drink the DC is twelve that is an

eight okay so on the sixth ring paltin

you feel your consciousness begin to

fade and you just sort of faceplant on

the table before I faceplant like on the

way yeah I'd be like well wait so I wake

up alright

you wake up sometime later up in a shadi

bed on what you believe to be the second

floor of the in the roof is sort of

slanted on one side of the room and

there are holes in it where the shingles

have fallen away and you can just see

the gray sky above the furnishings in

here are all shabby and there's all

sorts of dark corners and things and you

Connor

laughter downstairs it's definitely

Narayana whose voice you hear from down

below there is a crappy old window

looking off down toward the crossroads

canted at a weird angle like the

building's sloped at some point or the

wall sloped and so it's not a perfect

rectangle anymore and so it's got this

broken shape and there's just sort of a

bit of light coming through and falling

down on you

on this mafia in bed okay

so in light of all that how's my face

feel you sort of sit up you put your

hand on your face it feels like it's

still there oh okay you see you see

there's an old dresser with like this

mirror on the wall above it the mirror

is all dusty and cracked you could take

a look at it there if you want to if you

want to yeah I kind of want you okay you

go over and you sort of brush the dust

and stuff off the mirror and you look

you look and it it's your face okay Oh

what what Chris Perkins but but okay

when you come downstairs you can see

that levar doe and nervous en levar

dough looks drunk out of his like just

Gore and he's they're dancing to no

music in the tap room and they're

banging into furniture because he is

sort of sloshing around and she's

laughing a head off and as you come

creaking down the stairs they just sort

of stop and they turn to you and they

give you these sort of cryptic elven

looks
