hi everybody welcome to our Dungeons &

Dragons show yes

previously in dice camera action the

waffle crew spent a day at the beach and

then came home to find things at the

Waffle House were not good a

confrontation with Warrington Munt ended

with him dead after he had undergone the

process of Sarah Moore Phasis becoming a

giant mind flare after he was taken down

the waffle crew realized that the kids

were nowhere to be seen

so evylyn you activated your winged

boots flew out of the waffle house into

the middle of the summer night and

started to search the neighborhood for

signs that they may have fled you even

knocked on follows follows door to see

if they were keeping the kids there but

after not finding them there you went to

check other places and continued to

check and continue to check hunting high

and low in all the places you think

little kids might hide after seeing a

7-foot tall mine flare trusting that

your companions were searching the house

about probably less than an hour into

your search evylyn you're flying over

the rooftops of Waterdeep the moon is

out so the moon taught them the tops of

the homes are all bright enough lit that

you can see them clearly and you can

even see slats of light down in the

alleys between the various homes and it

is after a futile search finding no

evidence of the children that you hear

this ripping sound followed by a huge

explosion and a black cloud rising from

the Waffle House and by now it by now

you're about five blocks away

uh well that sounds important yes

drinking yes so you stop and you turn

and you see once the explosion has

passed and you this cloud of debris

rains down over troll skull alley you

can see that the house is still on fire

particularly the turret which looks like

a candle flame if one takes a brief

moment to consider whether this looks

like an enemy explosion of Strix

explosion a paltin explosion or just

there's no tea you can make an insight

check I wonder what all this is about

forgot my

23 you think it's a gunpowder

explosion of immense proportions you

heard a similar thing when Warrington

Mundt accidentally dropped a keg and it

blew up at his feet this sounds much

worse than that echoed and you're

hearing it echoing across the city in

the dead of night so that has something

to do with it

evylyn has a brief moment of joy and

recognition cuz she's really proud that

she's learning about guns because it's a

new weapon and she feels really insecure

about the fact that she doesn't know how

this weapon works so she's like gun

powder Oh gun powder and she flies

toward the house all right as you make a

beeline toward the house Edelen you are

in a position to see set what's appear

to be several lights rising up into the

night sky from different parts of the

city

it's very strange almost like like which

lights are bobbing lights or something

is that one like nearby my trajectory on

the way home mmm yeah they're kind of

coming from all directions so some of

them are actually kind of heading in

this they're all heading toward the

Waffle House all toward our house yes

one of those real quick so I'm just like

I'm beeline toward the house and I see

these lights and I'm like I'm gonna kind

of you know just veer around to see if I

can get up close to one okay you can see

that the light is at the tip of a staff

being held by a flying wizard good

evening friend wizard that's when you

see this big black plume and embrace

flames soaring up into the sky above the

house and the wizard just looks at you

like you asked the silliest question

she's a nerd wizards are the fire

brigade I get it okay um and she be

lines back toward those okay meanwhile

back at the house mm deaaath paltin

Strix the children are all standing over

these sort of unsettled patch of cobbles

as debris and fiery embers rained down

on top of you and when you turn back to

the house you can see that the fourth

floor is practically gone except for a

sort of the skeleton frame of some beams

and rafters and the turret is like a

roman candle burning mightily away I

leave for one week yeah doesn't feel

good does it

[Laughter]

DF your room was practically obliterated

you're pretty sure you saw some of your

possessions flying through the air onto

the rooftops of other buildings yeah

there's a certain sense of devastation

in Deus but he's also just kind of like

of course why I can't have nice things

okay but most of your stuff was in

chests right yes what inflammable chests

it might be fine they were just on fire

go get it

well you know as always says you got a

demo something this is more than that

she didn't say shatter doesn't matter

let's get back in there I don't go in

there I can't hurt me

so I will go in there just wait here all

right dad I can do

alrightso deaath and paltin you wait

outside while all Strix goes into the

house begrudgingly shuffling into the

house okay right bits of shingles

falling all around you yeah I'm just

gonna look for anyone's possessions or

any like I guess is in Simon's outside

we don't was waffles in there we don't

know waffles was in the house as far as

you know but probably not on the fourth

floor okay okay then she's okay all

right I'm just gonna go in there and try

cuz I don't have any water spells so

that's out of the question so it worse

right well I'm just gonna look for

anyone's possessions that I need to like

pick up and bring back down and put out

the flames okay

let's see one two three whoops one two

three okay while you're all standing

there so one of the features that used

to decorate the roof of the waffle house

where these kind of iron spikes sort of

lying to the peak one of those spikes

comes falling down and impales Simon

through the shoulder smaller outside yep

he's just standing there and out and

then he just sort of collapses as this

thing sticks in him and falls to the

ground

evylyn ah

evylyn you show up you CDF and paltin

standing outside the house with the kids

most of the debris that has rained down

has now landed all over the street

you can see sheets and broken old

furniture and something that looks like

a wooden mannequin with a bunny ear

sticking out of its head half burned and

charred and other things that you didn't

even know we're in your house now

splayed out for all to see and you can

see that all of the neighbors have

either stuck their heads out of windows

or come out onto the street as well and

you see Simon bleeding out on the ground

okay fewer than that now I mean yeah oh

here than that max now he has he since

becoming a boy he has fewer hit points

than he did when he was a construct yeah

great fleshy kid he's not gonna have

right warriors right well when you come

upon him you're lucky that you are here

when you did because he could have

easily been killed by that if he doesn't

receive some amount of healing

immediately she does well she kind of

looks

the rest of the party like with this

dude to the babysitter like with the kid

bleeding yeah right just like thank

goodness you showed up and he was awful

so you think given Simon's size and how

strong he is like five hit points will

probably be enough to restore him okay

but you'll also want to take this spike

out of his torso she she puts her hand

on like the base of the spike and looks

at paltin while she rips the spike out

and Simon Simon just kind of does this

convulsion I didn't put it there

what happened anyone well as soon as

that happens shows up do you have to be

like huh it takes the other kids and

like shuffles them under like some cover

or something or like out of the streets

from debris it's at this point evylyn

then you realize you seem to have

inherited another kid because martim

Trek the young boy that you gave juniper

to is with your your kids

although the lot he's he's he looks

worse for wear than the last time you

saw him he was even when he was Simon's

prisoner locked in a box martim didn't

look as sickly and unkempt as he does

now it one just kind of gathers all the

kids like come here it's okay come here

come to okay even I'll hold you just

coming well what happened I can explain

explain I can't explain but now is not

the time we need to make sure the house

is okay so everyone gather up what you

need and we need to make sure that

everyone's safe I

I couldn't I could totally explain right

now I am NOT stalling to try and figure

out how I'm gonna explain this later we

just really need to stay on top of the

situation ignores him it looks at deaath

and goes what happened there's soap

beside himself he has no idea look at

him he's trotty I like put my hand his

face is like look at him the poor boy he

doesn't know what happened he

watched a smaller poorer boy just get

impaled these children no no they know

not what they see their innocent eyes

have all right Alton on this one we

should make sure everything's okay first

then we'll talk you probably like hear

from the inside it's it's fine I'm just

on fire a little strict so you go up to

the second floor and you into waffles

den and you can see that the al bear is

buried under a fort that she's made oh

all the things in her room oh no I'll

just walk up there any all right her

bomb is sticking out the back but her

head buried under a whole bunch of stuff

and just kind of you see a beak sticking

out all right I'll never be a little rub

never snack and just be like I'm sorry

waffles this isn't the best place for an

owl bear and it never really has been

but you know we're doing our best the

way it is yeah yeah I'm sorry sorry girl

let's give her a little ruffle okay when

you're there and you're you're kneeling

down beside her and giving her a ruffle

she kind of stands up a little and

shakes off all the stuff that she buried

under having now the confidence to

emerge okay good girl

you learned great from that ability I

taught you earlier which is dig and

panic good job you learned so well all

right you can hear you hear sort of

clunking down onto the roof or sorry the

the floor above you what sounds like

debris and you can hear fire above all

right all right I'll just be like stay

here make sure to get back under get

back under your panic Hut like we talked

about and I'm gonna go upstairs and

hopefully uh I don't know you think

would probably be safer for her if you

were to lead her out down the back

stairs and out of the building okay all

right I thought I thought about that all

right all right here we go Awful's we're

going outside shall follow you out and

down the stairs all right is this so

where everyone is standing no it's kind

of on you now come down to the side of

the building and you have to make your

way around toward the front but you can

see that troll skull alley is full of

people now

staring and wonder and it is around this

time as Evelyn is questioning paltin and

death and Strix is emerging from the

building that all of these wizards with

lit stabs and ones who are flying over

the building and casting look like

they're about to cast spells and you

begin to see the clouds in the sky

gather our cool artificially and

powerfully and become dark and full full

of rain just like oh it's so cool

disaster disaster districts I think

after dia then palton were less than

forthcoming yeah one would kneel down to

Martin and be like hey Mark time how you

doing what are you doing here are you

okay you sound so much different I know

weird place with a scary Wizards lady it

was like this hospital house its web and

spiders and I've been really hungry and

she was me but and also like to choke

slam laughing ghosts but then those

people showed up also in there and but I

was also hanging out with Simon and

Jenkins they're really cool too but

don't worry they got us out and they did

a little spinny thingy like washing we

came back here and then everything that

boom sounds like more or less actually

yeah okay you tend to get kidnapped a

lot don't you you don't you don't

remember being kidnapped

oh no well other than the once by Audra

oh we're being kidnapped by Simon okay

just the Audra okay one time I want you

an again I mean right kidnapped is is a

weird way to put it but you know being

held in a house against your will

anything huh where your where's your

family

[Laughter]

why which makes it easy to get kidnapped

I guess so do you live here now

okay well okay

of course even like pulls him into hug

again kind of pets his head and she's

like of course you live here now

what a good care of you of course he

lives here now Simon's like I'm still

feeling kind of hurt over here I gave

you all that you need little one do you

feel emotionally hurt come here

give mom a hug here come into my hug

with Martin Christ Oh Simon sort of

pushes martim aside and then embraces

you she Pat's his head too and squidly

cease fire is just like whoa and it's

like walking towards it okay the the

Wizards clouds spiral over the house the

wind picks up and rain begins to pitter

pitter pitter pitter pitter fall out of

the sky down upon the house making you

rain on dem house yeah you think that

this is the storm is going to grow in

force and strength over the city and

hopefully douse the fires that are

currently burning down your turret thank

you paulten approaches evylyn it's just

like alright now that that situation is

covered I guess I can explain okay so I

don't know what he did or I don't know

how he did it

but there was a masked man

no one knows who he is he's some sort of

some sort of vigilante doesn't play by

anyone's rules but he comes in and

serves what he thinks is his version of

justice and it's arguable it's arguable

it's to be heard of this in before like

there are legends of him there very well

might be starting very soon after what

he did to our house oh he's what did

what did he look like he wore a a black

cloak he just blends into the shadows

very handsome could only think no well

I'm I don't have a died no no of course

not

very handsome good jawline definitely um

very healthy height you know probably

like 6-1 6-2 you know people will say

like 510 but you know it's a little more

than that it's just fit but but but

without a doubt there's very relevant

offer Oh serious for a one moment in

your entire life I'm talking about the

man who did this no one knows who he is

but he is the night so you're saying

that there's some sort of vigilante that

wanted to come blow up our house it

might have been it might have been to

stop the attackers I don't know it there

were attackers it came out of costs but

he fought bravely and you know what I

side with him oh yes there were

attackers - sorry that wasn't mentioned

the storm what grows in intensity more

rain falls quite high looks more

confused by this explanation constricts

is gonna lead waffles to the front okay

or everyone else is okay your deal it's

fine

I'll take it from here there there was a

dark cloaked

ants a masked vigilante protector of the

city maybe we'll see him again someday

who knows

you signed to ID yep Wow who is he and

what does he want probably what's best

for everyone

I don't know well maybe we should talk

to him get him to join up join forces

with us no I I don't think that would be

necessary he he comes off as someone who

wants

work alone and also not ever be in the

same room at with me at the same time

yeah that'll definitely not happen I

don't really understand what happened to

blow up our house and also it would be

important for me to understand because

I'm pretty sure that the City Guard is

gonna start asking questions because I

don't think you can just like blow up a

house and have all the Wizards come and

put out your fire without having to

answer some questions I'll talk to this

city watch but oh there there sorry

their arrival was inevitable but

inevitable look deep within Warrington's

room was some sort of strange mannequin

like device we hurt palter we heard

whirring before we even got there in the

first place yes that means it was used

before we did or stricted mm-hmm that

was me using it yeah member I

disappeared loosed yeah we got sent to

like some other dimension I don't know

if it was the shadow fell or something

it was like it was spooky with a bunch

of spiders and audre the wizard that

used though had the rug delivered to our

house apparently lives there I stole her

book though so hey also yeah she was

invisible you were right when I first

got there like I heard that machine

going it was correct before any of us

yes no I did it it was me right before

you before wait before me yes

was she nice no that activated we didn't

meet her well

activating that's sort of actually it's

a portal what set us into a I guess a

different dimension or something that's

very close to this place but very

different very shadow Feli and dark and

evil for sure but Audra Nell was

certainly here that's where Martin was

and the kids were also pulled in this

place they managed to fend for

themselves and protect themselves

another dimension right I mean that's

pretty tame but most the stuffs happened

to us but yeah yeah

Audra Nell was there and she was still

able to attack us from whatever the

other dimension is including dr. sex a

moth who also showed up

it was very dr. sex op he was very

interested in the mind flared cadavers

but that's not all this other dimension

it's it was like this place but I guess

evil it was ruled by a death knight a

dragon and Evelyn of Chartres at which

point a lightning bolt comes down on the

clouds strikes the tower and blows its

top off and the one of the wizards calls

out oh sorry no worries didn't need it

anyway I guess and we just lost like our

one port key to every other places

that's not true I have a I have this and

I pull out the tuning fork oh that's

right we managed that tricks was able to

obtain a lot of things from Audra Nell

also my new stick lets me go to

different planes just a quick question

who is Evelyn of Chartres and why does

she pronounce her name so weird right um

you guys really need to work on filling

me in the guards come over to question

you yeah Strix could definitely fill you

in

I'll be right back um you weren't there

for that were you or what the it was a

construct that so these hags made clones

of us because we have soul worms in us

from when they visited us at night this

is this is where this is where the

camera pans away and the voice Strix his

voice becomes a little bit more muted

you can't hear it because it's all stuff

that everybody already knows she's

explaining it like Alton directly

approaches the camera it's like all

right the rest of you are filled in on

this so we're just gonna like

all right long story short the storm

continues through the nights until the

Wizards basically summit and they kind

of let it run its course at this point

and it dealt it dampens the house it

drenches the fire extinguishing it

completely so that only smoke rises from

the structure by morning

DF after flashing your badge and

exchanging a few words you are pretty

much left alone one of the things I want

to make sure that I get across to them

is to get messages to the different -

like the black staff to the through

Wizards guilds who have been

investigating odd Rennell about this new

information that we have or potentially

even pieces of this weird manikin

contract that we know they'll recover

that since it's lying in the street yeah

and see that that's delivered to the

watchful order for examination

since the mages are probably better

equipped to take care of that but they

will also probably they'll tell you that

an investigator will probably be

assigned to follow up on the audre now

matter and get all the information you

know about her yeah great Strix is also

probably going to give them the book

that she obtained oh okay because she

does she can't rabbit all right so they

will they will take the book into the

possession while this is going on other

members of the city watch ADEA are

talking to all of your neighbors you

don't know what they're talking about

you can see the neighbors the neighbors

aren't happy and in some cases are

yelling at the guards but the guards

basically create a buffer between you

and them and eventually all the

neighbors are asked to go back to their

lives that's right the official city

watch business neighborhood PR yeah

little like shoulder padding and like

just like oh man what we're all in this

neighborhood together and isn't that

just the way some times where your house

blows up and I'm sure we'll be all right

thank you can Strix try and give them

some pies so to smooth things over

you mean right on the the ones that she

has in the taproom oh yeah one of the

people when you hand the pie to them

says what the is this glass and

pulls shards of glass at this pie no

that's not glass do you realize that

this is at one point a couple sessions

ago paltin when he was involved in the

rug broke the glass on the case

goddamnit

shards of it must have gotten her lodged

in the pies I just I take the glass I go

it's not glass and eat it they just

stare at you and see if you actually

swallow it I do just as a fun fact but

if you chew glass enough it turns back

into sand

that's true so I don't it's hidden under

my tongue or shatters here just one or

the other it's hidden under my tongue

yeah it turns out you're shart your

glass shard pies aren't the big hit that

you thought they were I just take them

all back and I like find a piece of

burning rubble like on the property and

just wrote them in there all right

evylyn and DFU both discover that your

rooms have been destroyed evil ins

because yours was rate under Warrington

month's room which was ground zero so

the entire floor fell in and basically

crashed into your room burning Timbers

from the roof then fell on top of it

igniting anything in the room that you

considered to be of you know that could

be saved she walks into the center of

the room and kind of does like a slow

turn you can't even open the door to

your room all the way you just sort of

look in and see all this crashed down

rubble and burning timber and for a

second it looks like she's like

devastated because you know how much

care she's put into decorating this room

but she picks up a charred like half of

a wall hanging that says live and she

goes well it was time for a redecoration

anyway and she just like starts taunting

around and doesn't seem to be bothered

at all she's

what an opportunity right demo did

something right

demo to Renault yes that's the one yep

yes I'll try to go to his room to see if

there's anything that can be recovered

well ain't there there's a there's

literally nothing no floor no walls no

just little bits of roof and rafter and

the chimney what about all the box with

the pop bands nothing yeah you open up

the door and you could just fall right

into Paul Tain's room I know things

blown away as well can I see anything

from the rooftops here that maybe they

were like tossed aside well there's

still a lot of smoke issuing from this

floor but you kind of gaze out through

the smoke cloud into onto the

neighboring rooftops make a perception

check that might be mr. shamble face

lying on somebody's roof over there yeah

just kind of just kind of burning a

little or smoldering a little in the

rain you know what the rain is probably

washing it down into the gutter of that

roof I think it's about time that thing

burned away anyway all right

well if nothing on the rooftops I guess

as well clean stuff up if I happen to

see or find anything I'll give it a shot

okay Alton we should do a fundraiser

like a like a fundraiser stream on your

which stream from it sounds for

renovation that sounds really good yeah

maybe people would want to donate if

they knew just like what had happened

and we could all like you know perform

on stream maybe we could do like one of

those enduring on there we go like for

24 hours cheering listen is like no and

she's gonna go fly up and they aired

look for stuff on the roofs to make a

perceptions

I could also pick up some extra gigs and

you know we could with those tend to go

well now so I'm sure I'm sure people

would be more than happy to help you

know Paul Zepa of Waterdeep get a floor

back - that's a 14 that is a rental all

right you do find some debris on the

rooftops that you're sure was probably

in your house at one point but nothing

that you would consider worth salvaging

back at the house it's clear that the

only bedrooms that survived were Strix

ha's and the kids and waffles basically

the second floor rooms well you know as

the Scriptures tell us here we go

sometimes the Sun burned so bright in

one's life that it will burn you down to

the foundation and from that foundation

a new self can grow and that's what's

gonna happen here a new home for all of

us I'll just sleep in the tap room okay

Dame wait a week for old times sake why

don't we sleep in Pelton's Hut we could

have a sleepover but all the kids phones

like my what oh yeah oh yeah I know that

helpful the kids need their own room we

can't we can't all be in the same room I

guess we could all stay in waffles room

the kids can have their own room and

will have the hut yeah I could like

banish the kids that's kind of like them

having okay honestly the kids will sleep

anywhere they're finally I'm just kind

of like clinging to all the kids like

the only bed that's left in this entire

house is my bed and I thought for that

bed and it's like that that was my own

bed it was my own things and that's they

know the kids can have that what what's

what's left of my room your room has all

have deaths room in

currently okay upgrade well not so much

there's not there's nothing really

salvageable in your room that you could

possibly sleep on it's just full of like

evil ins debrief mmm great yeah it's all

like gold and shiny and burnt yeah

squiggly like walks out and he's just

got like one little one little flame on

his horn that was fun I like fire I'm

gonna look more into this nothing next

day sorry Oh as a Strix is just gonna

start also cleaning out all the skulls

and like gross out of a roomie like

no reason to keep this in here anymore

not mine it's been a it's been a long

long day it has this is the day of the

beach party sure was gosh all right let

it be known that Chris Perkins could not

let us have just a beach party three

episodes because we also had our house

explode and it'd push the button so DF

in the early hours of the morning

there's a knock on the door it's one of

your neighbors they say something of

yours some sort of heavy chest is lodged

in their roof oh they estimate the

damage is probably going to be somewhere

in the neighborhood of a hundred gold so

kitty and they stand there I don't

really have that money at the moment

I'll just keep the chest well it's

really better if you'd leaves just give

them something in the chest

oh wait wait just wait depending on what

chest it was there might have been money

or availables in that chest if I could

just take a look at it I would happily

give you one of those if there's

anything he lets you follow him to his

house leads you up to the second floor

where you can see the chest

is basically and leads you up into the

attic and you can see that the chest is

lodged in the roof and it is the the big

chest with all the stuff in it okay it

was so heavy it punched a hole I'm gonna

check the inside of it and see if

everything is still in there

yeah with his help you can kind of

dislodge it from where its wedged in the

roof bring it down into his attic and

then open it to see since everything was

packed so well in there and I assume you

put it all back yeah that it none of it

seems to have suffered any damage oh

that's good

the chest itself is a little damaged

from its flight yeah I'm sure the nice

friendly warning to thieves on it is

probably just fine too

they said that that warning is a little

kind of blackened so it's hard to read

but yeah it's there though all right

we'll just be like all right yes again

at the hole in his roof I'm sorry I'm

sorry here he'll open it up and I take

out the probably probably the missile

and shape of the wall and just be like

this is a very very valuable fine clasps

at trinket and you could sell this on

the market for far more than hundred

gold he sort of looks at it and goes

what else is there he doesn't seem too

enamored with the whistle uh yes goes

back getting this goes there's a

spyglass what's that big jug thing is

that is that like old feet yeah it's

super old and has a lot of cool like

inscriptions on it probably a lot of

unknown history that scholars would be

very interested in I think that'd make a

good gift for a friend of mine I'll take

that guy interests you in this do you

have hangs up the news he looks a little

surprised and scared of you all of a

sudden intimidate so sorry it was bad

jokes all right get will hand them the

judge but yeah it's that's okay just

make sure it gets it's again it's a very

very nice job very valuable practically

priceless just be smart with it and he

says do you need help move in that yeah

please it's like pathetic Lee tries a

toga yeah all right he he gets him and

his son to help you carry it back to

your place and they drop it on your on

your stoop all right thank you thank you

hey Lou sorry Ken no you drag it in to

the tap room just like what's that noise

they're all in the waffle it's a

sleepover yes and even is loving it yes

we'll just be like I gotta go my my

morning errands I'll be back soon do you

need a pie

uh I already got some but thank you I

know that was a lie don't touch my chest

[Laughter]

all right six black dice go tumbling on

to a table seated behind which is mother

tell Aston ad Aragon the blind drow high

cleric of the spires of the morning the

storm from the night before has blown

past and the morning light shines

through a window down upon these black

cubes on which you can see are white

inscriptions that mother tell Aston sort

of rubs her puts her fingers on to read

them for she cannot see what did I say

but she could feel what the dice say and

death as you gaze down upon the table

and see the dice that have been cast

there are six of them one has a spider

another one has a spider one has a son

and then there's another son and then

there's something that looks like a web

and something that looks like an eye

did you know that those kind of days

actually exist they're called dots RPG

and you can find them at Shapeways comm

they're really cool Braille dyes you

should check them out as least as the

dice are cast the door - mother - last

ins office opens and a priest comes in

he's got a thick gold necklace made up

of little interlocking sons over his

garments and he's holding a cushion in

front of him with a mithril diadem a

crown of elven craftsmanship resting

upon it and he sets it down on the table

within your view and mother - last ins

and mother - lastin says - UDF

this mithril diadem was worn by the elf

princes of Allah Thor

it has sat in our treasury for ages it

is worth at least fifty thousand gold to

which the priest says your eminence I

must protest this relic accounts for

half the value of our treasury we can't

afford to give it up to this insanity Oh

contraire she says we have hoarded it

long enough the dice have been cast

light fall is in our great interest and

like our faith it must be restored do

you feel and take a moment to say you

know I figured even you would understand

that money is nothing compared to the

actions of others

and you're saying that - did the

butthole guy who's like he he looks at

you his face Redden's but he does not

speak but in a moat for a flicker he

sort of darts his eyes away at the dice

and then at the Sun streaming through

the window and realizes you may indeed

have a point mother - lastin not looking

at the dice not looking at anything but

the air in front of her says did I say

you will have a safe journey but only if

you travel with the Guardian he will

come to you and watch over you with his

one good eye to tell him away would be

to court disaster right well meet his

guardian

he will come to you

okay all right should I expect him soon

or she looks at are not what she doesn't

look she just sort of points to the dice

in front of her and she says you're

looking at what she cast earlier spider

spider son Sean Webb and I still just

like what am I looking at and as you

look down at these at these black dice

and this eye staring back at you on one

of them you she says not very long all

right I can't I can't thank you enough

to see this relic restored it is an

honor to be able to help I

I know it served not only myself and

everyone in the land and let the ender

very well of course and when it is

remade please tell Evelyn

that we wish to see how again of course

of course she'll know and you can see

that she gets up out of her chair and

turns toward the light streaming through

the window and goes over to kind of soak

up the warmth as it were

the priestess sort of stays there

awkwardly takes one last look at this

prize on the cushion and then lifts up

the cushion to you so that you can take

it and/or the diadem yeah India through

like kind of gently take the cushion and

almost right away like take like a small

cloth or something from his back or

something you just kind of cover it to

like further protect it before he dashes

it away all right and as you grab it you

see the priest doesn't let go and then

you pull it away

finally he he releases it yeah it's like

giving up a fragment of his soul yeah

and that seems to be the end of the

conversation as far as mother talisman

is concerned all right

yes we'll give his final thanks and take

his leave okay from there you make your

way home so some information for you

you've already made arrangements with

great okay so with the weaponsmith yes

did I have like a ETA on that and they

were just a waiting proper payment or

essentially you'll make payment when you

meet the weaponsmith who used to reside

in Waterdeep but no longer does so

apparently because of some disagreement

he had with the guild all right so this

weapon Smith is a Sun elf his name is

Ian salon C and he lives in a village

called Rasul enter which lies to the

north of water

about 40 miles away almost almost a two

days travel first up the high road and

then when you get to the branch to the

long road you take the long road north

to wrassle enter it is on the way to M

fail a town you know of to be where

Evelyn's family hails all right and

wrassle enter you've done your research

it's a very very small village basically

a roadside village it's got one in

called the sleeping dragon which is

basically the only public accommodations

in the village and then there's an old

ruined keep of which little remains and

is ian has moved into an old tower

beyond the keep you're not sure why he

chose such a remote location but he is

the finest weapons crafter Waterdeep has

known in recent history all right I'm

sure you can do it all right great

and he's already been alerted you know

that much he's he's already said yes he

would do it once he receives payment got

it okay the priests the priests of the

temple you sending spells to basically

reach out to him okay does he have

everything else as well or not you have

all the composite got it okay all right

well cool oh I guess I'll back home all

right the rest of you who wake up

wondering where death went off to he's

got all these important matters to deal

with these days so too good for us so

fancy evens just an angled pile of all

the kids like draw stress is just gonna

go right back into the kitchen and clean

up the glass I think prestidigitation

can clean that up I don't know she's

gonna try okay people cooking around and

she's like Strix watch the bad do to

help good night evil Anna I don't know I

don't I don't know anymore I don't I

don't know

well I don't think we can wait until

paltin plays a bunch of shows to like

pay for the repairs do you remember that

patron that helped us fix it last time

do you think they want to do it again

Audra oh right that I think that's our

name otherwise I could maybe go to the

and see if maybe they have some sort of

assistance they could give us I think

our best bet right now is to just open

up the bakery again and try and sell

some pies to the neighbors you know we

can do

I'll make signs right now yeah just yeah

do you what you return tricks has a pie

ready and she's like you lied there got

me yes well guys just be back for my

errands glad you guys are up this

morning what you trying to figure out

how we're gonna get all this paid for

and fixed should we write to Magnus um I

mean I could talk to him and ask him

maybe you know you know prepare guys we

probably should I mean him being our

landlord and such he probably should

just Oh surprised who repaired this

place the last five times Oh Cory I made

arrangements with Nichols that's her

name

Oh Cory the local guilds have to get

involved of course it's a little bit

political sometimes but you can smooth

that over with some bribes at this point

we're just we're getting really low on

funds guys I think out of Stowe

maybe you know I might be able to

animate some objects to help us rebuild

things if I think about it what I happen

to have like a cursory guess or estimate

how much repairs would cost for all of

it I'm given the damage you would

probably estimate the cost

prepares at about 2,500 gold there give

or take yeah guys we're getting really

low I mean I we can get this paid for

and repaired very lease but we're not

gonna have much left after that all

right

well I said I can animate some things

Paulson you can animate some things we

can animate lots of things Chris do I

know if the if that if that cloak

survived you're probably up there now

looking around for it just realizing oh

my god the cloak you go upstairs and you

start to dig around through the wreckage

of your room and yes you do find it and

yes it did survive oh cool thanks Chris

when you come back downstairs do you

have the cloak with you you're just

hiding it somewhere I have not come back

downstairs yet I see okay is it do I

know if it's possible to animate some

objects to build for us most of the

objects that you can animate lack some

fine motor skills that you would want

you have to basically build a house that

doesn't mean you can't use it to move

things around like hey nobody has to

carry that ladder I can just animate it

right all right hmm

what about chickens could chickens help

build something well you're the expert

on that Holly I don't know I'm going to

say that there are a lot smarter than we

think they are okay yeah but they just

lack focus and leadership little beaks

can help carry things up and you know

they can float their spectral I don't

know I Turks is gonna try all of these

things in all sorts of hilarious

conundrums and you know montage of that

all right so when she's not cleaning up

after breakfast she's just animating

random stuff to see what she can get

away with right and chickens there's

chickens and animated things and right

yeah you chickens you can make eggs you

can make houses right same thing

okay well this is going on in the kid

sir probably upstairs playing hit the

wreckage she won't palm do you want a

drink

pollens upstairs he's gone okay I'm

going for a drink okay you go for a

drink and when you do you pour it you

turn around it goes down to like the

downstairs the basement though like

where we hold all the winery okay

and in the cellar got it yeah well sit

down there he retrieves a few hidden

objects that he's safely stashed away

all right so many secrets dear secrets

would dress up with a wine when you come

back up you can see that Jarl axel is

seated in Paul tans chair again evil is

not present is she yeah this the first

one to see him but as soon as he starts

talking evil and you recognize the voice

you're probably in the kitchen helping

strix clean up the dishes and everything

while she's busy talking to chickens but

you hear his unmistakable voice greet

death in its warm boozy way immediately

looking at Durrell Axl what does his

face look like sort of a purplish hue

eyepatch there it is and a hat a big

wide brimmed hat with a feather

a colorful feather of course of course

Jo Axl you know go to the table sit down

start the wine between them he'll take

the wine and drink it put it down and

shove it back over to you it is good to

see you my friend

to what do I owe the honor there you

know I am here I must protect my

investment

kind of you this should be a relatively

quick trip I don't foresee any dangerous

I don't yes of course we are partners if

not friends n'est-ce pas

yes and evylyn you hear that voice that

great talk about levander the other

night how are you doing how is your

pursuit of the light yes give us

evylyn like the biggest slow turn Jarl

axle will will stand up and he will take

his hat off and he will bow to you

evylyn and he says please please come

over want to join us and he will pull

out a chair for you he'll push you in a

little bit and he says you received an

invitation to the auction did you not to

either 2df if we are to return in time

we must travel with haste we received it

right I appreciate didn't we did yes

got the invitation and we're still

making under arrangements and yeah this

is something I've been trying to get

done for a long time now and he'll plot

back down into into strata bunch Arabic

kind of rub his hands on the comfortable

arm rests I might be able to make

arrangements for horses to help expedite

travel any turn he loses interest in the

details and turns to evil in and starts

to comment about how radiant she looks

and how the Sun itself does not warm his

heart as she does you're just so kind

but of course as you know the only

sunlight that comes from within is that

of a sander paltin your your dark senses

tingle axel says that look before he

catches on seat Alek

so after he says that with like the like

the whole foundation of the house just

like being really withered and the

floors being unstable like as soon as he

says that paltin just kind of crashes

through a floor why am I in here it's

probably plot Oh pops and Jarl Axl's

here isn't that nice he came to visit it

is who are you mrs. Jon Axl directs all

he has an affinity for the Sun like I do

I think we were in a battle with him in

a park the other day we were walking we

were talking about sunlight Oh were you

the light tank at the last show it's no

smiles

no that was shoot Oh God

I'm so sorry I'm your memory just is

getting real bad these days you should I

just checked out I just meet so many

people nowadays being you know palton

SEPA of Waterdeep v capital v of

Waterdeep that's true he is so famous

now he must have so many people to

remember I'm surprised he even remembers

me I hate I hate the term famous but I

mean please I'm doc gosh numb now I'm on

the spot here anyway um what do you want

he sort of leans back in straw bunch

Arabic and says I am Strad unsure of it

just like dumped somehow he anticipates

that instantly and hops to his feet and

just sort of pushes the what the heel of

his shoe pushes the chair back a little

bit and stands there like he was

expecting that and says I am here to

make sure that the beautiful lady evil

in his way United with her weapon like

for what nothing we gotta go

like I got crushed I feel like from the

kitchen you just hear it no no you'd

move that the other way no no you just

hear chicken noises we are all taking a

trip - where are we going how it's

pronounced errs wrestle at wrestle enter

wrestle Lanter okay yeah that right what

would how would even react to wrassle

enter knowing it's on the way to an fail

as you would expect her to it's it's on

the way home she knows where it is she

passed through it many times to get the

water deep is there anything fun to do

there absolutely

well the the sleeping dragon in it can

be a fun place if there are people to

hang out with but it's kind of quiet and

provincial this village there's not much

not much has happened there in a long

time

I guess she would know of that

weaponsmith with her affinity for

weapons probably um it's well you don't

the name hasn't come up yet so you don't

know so I don't know he lives there

he hasn't before oh right okay so oh

brass lantern not a bad place you know

we'd go there after some some adventures

from time to time oh sorry I was under

the impression that this was just gonna

be a individual Oh mission it wasn't it

was very minor but this is so important

so reunion of great magnitude why why

exclude your friends plus company what

good company and he leans down to kiss

Evelyn's head yeah I definitely think we

should go on our own like way okay so

this guy showed up to tell to tell that

even has her weapon idea okay so that it

that's kind of the gist and we have to

go somewhere and do something right well

you can stay if you want he says to you

specifically because the plot senses

were tingling and this this seems like a

you thing you got it under control and I

had I had stuff I was doing upstairs so

I'm gonna get back to that I'm just

gonna go back upstairs

yeah stay here with Evelyn and the kids

Strix you'll need to be here to help run

the pie shop as well someone

I'm in the kitchen you gotta come tell

me I see

Joel axle turns to evil and says do you

not wish to see your weaponry forged

what you're mistaken light fall is not

it's in pieces and death has all the

pieces it's just you know it's not

something that's fixable if it were he

would have fixed it by now he turns to

death you're der look

this won't be take that long being

getting come back no problem let me have

this I mean if you don't want me to come

to you that whoa I know I understand

that's just two days there two days back

an opportunity to get out of the city to

see the beautiful landscape well of you

if you like spending time together I

mean I'd love to talk more about with

the end or sometime we could just get

together when you get back I cannot

think of anything more that I would like

to do then talk about letting down oh my

gosh I love talking about lebanner this

is gonna be some fun I could think of

far more important things there is

nothing more important than Lysander

sorry let me rephrase that

evylyn there's something I have for you

Keith we'll go over to his chest and

open it up and take out the book of

nursery rhymes and give it to evylyn

well that's sweet

this is this is for you I figured what

is she five don't be an

that's your paltin froze there's column

Jarrah here even I figured you

know this this might be good for you to

know maybe read to the kids at night or

maybe even teach them to read at all and

on if they have that but you know do I

notice anything in particular about the

book is there pretty just like standard

yeah it's pretty standard book of

nursery rhymes that's right it looks it

looks very old

you don't recognize most of the nursery

rhymes Oh that'll be fun I always love

learning new stories

relax ol says yes well if we are going

to get on our way dear you and I alone

on this long trip we should not waste

any more time

right I'm Yvette I'm reapplying her own

I ate it wait you ate glass I'm okay EF

looks back at Jarrell Axl and Becca's

tricks actually strix yeah why don't you

come I am magic I can help ya I think it

could be a good idea okay I'm just gonna

assume someone did it and it was really

funny what

the nickname what was it it was Joe it

was Joe okay all right jar

 let's go

you can see that jar lack jar Lexel just

gives you a wan smile just the slightest

smirk like yeah I get the joke and then

he turns to evil and says we do not have

time to waste we want to be back in time

for the auction it is very important of

course that we all show up after all we

are all trying to get the stone together

right and then after that you and I can

go on on with any retreat

of course of course that is the way it

should be and your friend Paulton Charl

now that he is yeah he won't be offended

he doesn't like talking about levander I

don't think he'd want to come of course

not he is but the shadow to your son

right I know I can't hear that but I

heard that above game always to get out

but only if there are something between

you all right that's actually a really

good illustration how I never thought

about it like that before

and then they'll tip his hat to you and

turn to death and say we best not wait

any longer

yeah let's go after you oh that was the

title guys real good no title I was real

good Chris Oh stretch is coming we as

Jarl Axl makes his way out sort of

walking right between death and strix he

says it is possible not all of us will

survive that's okay I am death Lord ah

all of us are surviving

this is this quick trip just to wrestle

Lanter this is easy if you say so

are you sure everyone shouldn't come do

you I don't want to die he'll go he'll

walk out the door he's gone you don't

know where he's gone apparently out in

the Sun which is not usually a drought

thing to do I hate this guy me too

Boulton like is gonna come down the

stairs now yes oh my goodness guys you

won't believe it

I found the cloak of that vigilante you

were wearing along with this note that

he wrote he must have left it should I

read the note oh man um yes okay this is

definitely not written on a receipt

that'd be weird

says why he's like why am i yelling um

says to my best friend palton weird we

barely knew each other but you seemed

like a super cool guy a stand-up

gentleman one who deserves maybe a

little less critique than you receive

huh which is why I I will confide this

information in you you seem trustworthy

resilient I haven't see a bit of myself

in you but not in like a not in like a

sexy way unless you'd be into that which

we could totally do because we are

definitely different people regardless

I've caused too much damage in your

already broken life wow dude okay a

better friend a more open honest and

handsome enough friend for you I'm

hanging up my mic cloak as my career as

a masked vigilante is over after many

many years which is how long I've been

doing this just not in water deep I

leave my cloak to you do what you wish

perhaps it's worth something and can

repair the damages I did when I blew up

that part of your house wow so it was

him crazy I know that this robe would

appear to be the cloak of Manchu nin

both look feel battle we're stitching

powers abilities perhaps even smell like

him a bit it totally isn't yours truly

the bard Knight

well how about that I guess we could

sell this cloak tricks just looks it did

it was like you know I know I I need I

need some days away from everyone I

think well well look at that this is

probably worth something huh wild look

we can take care of that when we can do

some fundraising while you guys are on

your trip

right right paltin yeah absolutely that

is the plan very nice of him all right

that first for me

Strix I still don't trust this man at

all we need to be extra careful around

him what I want is extra careful mean

like death ward every day yes okay until

it until you die well it has a duration

right I'll look it up later

guys I'll do it every day

yeah let's just be careful about it stay

close cuz I don't trust him at all

eight hours all right oh yeah today

every day at dawn death wards for both

of us all right so just so you know

Strix since you Arcana this robe you do

think that obviously or this this cloak

if you were to sell mentions cloak you

would get it pretty quite a large amount

of money for it you don't you don't know

exactly how much but more money than

you've ever seen in your life

all right so Strix role will yell back

at paulsen and be like paulsen it's

super magic and you can sell it for a

lot of money so don't take less than

it's worth it's evil though yeah but I

mean it's it can be dismantled or

something or someone not evil it belongs

in a museum

I sure you might be able to sell it as

mansion's cloak if you make like a

little display and maybe a little fake

art robot arm or something and yeah we

could put it on that mannequin yeah

good idea right uh-huh mannequins going

nevermind if it were still alive yes

it's worth a lot of money try and sell

it while we're gone maybe dying cool

anyway bye Daryl axel said we might die

we love you all

all right Strix in death when you step

outside Jarl axel is on the street

astride a ostrich like bird Oh with

feathers so resplendent as to reflect

all the colors of the rainbow and it's

it's got a big Bobby plume oh yeah I see

what you're doing here oh hello guy

come on strikes for renting horses

alright Strix reluctantly goes alright

you're still just get on her broom it's

like I don't need a horse I don't pay

for horses Morning Glory no that will

disappear if it gets far enough we have

what's what's his name Harold what the

hell is our horse name oh the donkey the

donkey I'm renting a horse

evylyn and palton are you seeing your

friends off are you just staying inside

I think I'm waving at the door that's

how I know that they were saying rent

horses mm-hmm I don't think Morning

Glory does dissipate when she's away

from me does she I don't think she does

and this is still she's been around

since the beach episode just chilling

out shakin sand out of her first so

she's around we can take her then and

even whispers in her ear help her jaw

relax

I'm the good word I wonder he's

interested I need to check this spell

now if you're gonna send it off the

steed serves you as a mount both in

combat you have a bond with it while

mounted on the seed you can do this and

that and this and that

that that you can dismiss it anytime as

an action to do while your seat is

within one mile of you can communicate

with the telepathically that looked at

but it doesn't say that you have to be

with it all the time right cuz I give

her the telepathic command now and then

she can just carry it out yep all right

so you guys going the two of you gonna

ride on Morning Glory

yeah alright sure we're not made of

money these days you know can't just go

around renting horses whenever yeah

relax a little wave at you evylyn Oh

like paulten like nudges in front like

bye-bye

I have fun leaving bye all right and

then Strix DF and relax I'll saunter off

evylyn takes note of the fact that Daryl

axel just said that thing about shadow

and sunlight how there's always

something in between and notes that

paltin has put himself in between

herself and joel axel just kind of looks

very thoughtful what do you do after

they've left badmouth him as much as I

can

[Laughter]

Moulton are we cool hell yeah Jackson

said that like this whole thing about

like shadow and sunlight like there's

just always something in between us but

like I didn't feel like there was

anything between us like I thought we

were cool other than the whole like you

know awkward like emotion talk we had

like a long time ago but that's like

that was so many seasons ago you know

right I don't I don't trust I don't

trust him to begin with you know he's

he's sinking you know he's he's looking

for the light oh he's looking for

something what do you mean ah well Wow

didn't think we'd be having a talk okay

so when a dirty filthy stinking lying

son of a wants to get with a witch

just you know illustratively just okay

no one's specific once to a 2-quart huh

a an individual they find desirable they

do this thing called lying

where they take the truth and then say

something else in if they think it would

best serve them to get what they want

from said person or thing you think

Sherlock's was trying to court me think

look have you seen how many people in

water deep are you know like kind to me

or like you know reverent or whatever

but nobody actually have you noticed

that everybody will surface be nice to

me but not actually follow through on

anything or actually want to spend any

time with me the only reason that

Jarrell axel wants to spend time with me

is because he's interested in law

theater I'm just you know I'm I'm

evening of the spires you know of course

everyone's gonna act and have you ever

even remotely attempted to incite

anything he said well yeah whenever he

wants to talk about Lysander I talk

about what theater right but have you

thought about if he means it or are you

just excited about the fact that

someone's asking you about Lysander well

why would know no one would be that

disingenuous about the light right of

course not

strix death on Morning Glory you head

north out of the city down into the

field Ward than out the gates onto the

open road and begin your journey

northward it is a beautiful summer day

oh I keep pointing at things like on the

side of the road like back of that

flower it's so pretty

yep and dejar Lex was just gallivanting

on his rainbow ostrich creature and your

decide helmet on your beautiful perfect

horse

and so sunny yeah it's really nice out

he's got the wide brim of the Hat to

help keep the Sun out of his eyes you

can see even that he's not entirely

comfortable with the brightness of the

day nobody tries not to show it

you know streaks is just like your lacks

all relax all you had a bunch of weird

looks as you were leaving the city from

people who don't usually see it a dark

elf astride a rainbow ostrich but now

that you're out by yourselves

he's very sort of quiet and just kind of

forging ahead

he knows what lies and had what lies

ahead of him and what's to be expected

and doesn't go out of his way to make

conversation there's something about him

though that's worthy of an insight check

tricks isn't doing she's going to relax

all relax all relax all somewhere off in

the distance you hear the if you're

palton voice whispering funny I'm

hearing voices again got a sixteen okay

he seems deep in thought but also a

little bit troubled is not the right

word perhaps a little bit slighted and

there's an undercurrent to this DF that

makes you uncomfortable like you you're

pretty sure that what happened back

there is going to have repercussions

like back back before we left

yeah and the look on his the almost

inscrutable nough suck but somewhere

under there you can see that he's he's

thinking about that

cool so by the yet before the end of the

day comes you reach the branch in the

road where a signpost says high road or

actually it says laylan Neverwinter in

one direction and then and fail read

large in the other I read large we've

been there and so you veer that way

toward red larch to get to wrassle enter

brass elantra we'll be the first village

you come upon on the long road great

those still stay as vigilant as possible

our journey has having actually been to

read large before you probably stayed at

the sleeping dragon in and wrestle enter

so that's not tricksters gonna tell Jarl

axel the whole story about the house

opening up and the universe sending

she's gonna like diet like just like

that happened until do you stop sir yeah

Jerell axel axel is not really engaging

much with Strix he doesn't want to open

that Pandora's box

but you do arrive at Wrestle enter safe

and sound on the second day after

spending the night out basically just in

a field under the beautiful stars and

Jarl axel has still been

uncharacteristically very quiet most of

the time but polite always polite

engaging all right after dismounting

I'll tell it relax well this shouldn't

take too long let's drop off of things

it'll probably be ready by the time

relieving tomorrow dad death Ward

mourning death ward he just takes his

hat off and fans himself with it

yeah and yes well emotion districts to

come with them okay so then we'll go to

the renowned blacksmith that we had made

arrangements with yes past the ruins of

the old keep which has largely been

plundered of its stone

into a basically grove of trees up

through there

onto a Foothill on the side of which

this old tower stands and you can see

it's whether the passage of time fairly

well and it's got a big chimney sort of

rising up alongside it and when you

knock on the door a bronze skinned son

elf kind of androgynous really greets

you and Usher's you inside and do you

show him what you brought yeah I'll

mention my name right away so they know

about it and then I'll show the mithril

diadem okay

icn's eyes are almost like pools of gold

as he looks at the diadem something he

hadn't expected to see ever again and he

picks it up he holds that he admires

it's beautiful craftsmanship and then he

sets it on a shelf I trust this will

suffice Strix is in there and she kind

of thinks for a moment she's like I feel

like I want to make sure no one comes

after us while we're in here I'm gonna

stay outside

I'm gonna watch shirt before he goes

tricks do you still have the things the

things yeah which things from I have

lots of things you got did you get him

back from the seating oh yes oh those

things yes yes yes and she like rifles

in her robes and just like and she's

like yes here you go she gives him the

two rings that she got back all right

the two rings of protection that each of

you had worn at one point all right do

you not gonna forget about that

all right this won't take long all right

but actually I think what she's gonna do

is just kind of wait by the door and

summon her chickens okay

just around the area just like as an

alarm system okay and she just kind of

looks it to relax long she's like don't

worry they know that your nice girl axel

is nowhere near here he stayed in

wrassle enter at the

okay okay all right yes we'll reach into

his pack and pull out a very old dirty

round bag what's like sounds like clean

metal inside set it on to the table and

open it up to reveal every broken shard

of light fall and then also take the two

rings and place them with it and just be

like these the materials Sen will pick

up the two rings and just look at them

side by side kind of put them together a

little bit close and he says these rings

contain what pieces of her soul there's

salt infinite light mm-hmm that which

was given to her by her father and her

mother right they will become part of

this weapon yes her mother to guide her

hand puts that ring down and her father

to guide her heart yes I want

he uh sure's you upstairs into the tower

at the top of which you can see there is

a brazier and he tells you he's going to

use these to melt these items down

together

the braziers magical so it will bind the

Rings to the shards and then from that

he will make the item you are free to

watch but you may not talk deaath will

just take out a piece of paper with a

sort of a sketch that he made of light

fall just to be like this is what it

looked like along with like his best

recollection of the scriptures on it he

says thank you that won't be necessary

alright then guess I'll just put it away

and just will watch silently it will

return to its original form with the

power of the Rings embedded in it Strix

you feel magic begins emanate from the

tower oh I mean I still go good are my

chickens disturbed are they cool they're

momentarily disturbed but they get over

it and I would like you to make a

perception check alright my chickens are

just hanging that's a 3 ok that's so

distracting this pulse of magic

radiating up from the tower that you

don't pay much attention to anything

else yep that's true but it's that's

just how it just practically practically

thrums with ancient magic yeah and I'm

just like here does really like totally

mood breaking like whoa neat from below

you hear an elven voice inside the tower

sort of hollow and resonant much louder

than a than it should be as it begins to

in Kent and chant I like call the

chickens over I'm like what's happening

yeah sort of hovering outside with your

chickens waiting for this to happen and

this continues for an hour Wow and then

it stops and the magic of the tower

subsides and the next thing you see is

DF coming out with something wrapped in

green cloth

is it done what's that and do you have

you bore witness to the creation of the

item or rather the recreation of the

item is he all found a baby no is that

what you think baby making no while this

is all going on a couple days have

passed back in water deep what have

evylyn and paltin been up to I thought

so you wanted to fill that cloak didn't

you Oh that'll help with the the thing

that I didn't do Chris do I think it

would be appropriate to take it to the

spires to see if the spires wants to add

it to their collection of like safely

squirreled away relics you're pretty

sure if you were to bring this to the

spires they might reject it out of hand

because of its evil nature do I feel

compelled at all to like destroy it

instead of sell it or do I buy this idea

that maybe we could sell it to someone

who would just want to collect it while

it's evil it has no malevolent intent

but if it ends up in the hands of an

evil person it will make them much much

more powerful so way way that as you

will I know if you really eccentric art

collectors in Waterdeep and I'm sure

there's someone who would just love to

add this to their collection have it

stand like in a hallway or something you

know mm-hmm right that that sounds very

safe which is why we should totally do

it

and I don't think this should ever come

back to bite us in the ass

well why would it I have no idea

Chris so evylyn are you going about this

search for a buyer alone are you gonna

try Paul tonight no I'm gonna drag

Bolton with me for sure okay you

searched high and low some people that

you know in the city who might be

interested or may know somebody who's

interested as you flash the item around

you get all kinds of reactions revulsion

it great interest

but it's really they tell you it's

really gonna take a wizard to walk to

this thing it doesn't do much good to

anybody I also am treating I'm treating

it like I'm a like an art dealer like

this is my client who owns this piece of

art got it

maybe charisma persuasion check to see

if you can really get anywhere 25 okay

very good you are told by three

different people that while they could

help you find somebody who may be

interested in buying it it's gonna take

a while because the value of it is so

high that very few people can actually

afford it mmm sounds about right so a

wizard who has the backing of like a

mega corporation or something like that

possibly like maybe like an organization

that's so pervasive that like the

funding is like almost unlimited right

like you you're getting at something are

you getting at something you know I met

no I didn't I never met but strix told

me about this wizard that works for

acquisitions incorporated I think his

last name was dark magic maybe he would

want it this is dark and it is magic

right sounds like the perfect candidate

and I'm sure omen wouldn't hire anyone

who would be evil enough to do something

bad with it oh it's oh that oh yeah

that's omens thing right what else you

got what do you mean it's a great idea

it's the best idea you could possibly

come up with a fantastic idea come on

let's go you knock on the door to

acquisitions Inc cut to strict Scindia

you uh you uh emerge from the tower you

leave is Ian to his solitude what do you

do next I leave him a pie okay yes I

would like you to make a perception

check

okay I'm good at ease that's good 27

okay

as you emerge from the tower with the

axe you catch sight of something moving

in the trees down away from the tower

within sight of the tower but you know

several hundred feet away and you

thought you caught the glimpse of a dark

elf chickens are still here and probably

not Jarl axel oh that's weird

I'm gonna quietly alert Strix to this I

don't know it necessarily means anything

nothing we can leave right now

yeah then we can just leave we sure can

can't we we sure can damn it

now we gotta get to relax hole I knew

you were gonna say that I know I'm not

happy about it either but trust me the

last thing we want to do is do anything

that would antagonize him

we're death warded for now we're death

for it here why don't we I'm just gonna

as soon as you alert me to something the

chickens are already there which is good

and I think what I'm gonna do is um give

us some more some more protection and

cast um I'm gonna go ahead and cast a

mage armor on myself and then also

protection from evil okay all right how

quickly can we get back to your

restaurant to relax close you can since

you've got morning glory it'd probably

take you like five minutes to get back

there

okay all right strike stop on all right

you know like I mean we can fly too okay

wow this is more fun okay so you bolt

back to the village

Morning Glory the chickens are following

by the way very slowly you leave them in

the dust and you you come skidding back

to the sleeping dragon and step inside

to find Jarl Axl just sitting at the bar

all right

strikes runs in just like Jackson we

need to leave now they're the evil

things out there you can come with us he

grabs his hat and follows you up all

right well we don't need to leave we're

just gonna leave right now we're just

gonna leave right from here go to the

panic room word of recall yeah two days

time very good

evylyn if omen were to offer you his

omen there am I dealing with one of his

like flunkies well if you show up he's

there well cuz I know that he's you know

a busy guy I happen to know he's often

Ravnica oh well well the timing this is

interesting I have to think about the

timing of this yeah cuz we're not

exactly in parallel timewise

but I mean I assume he has someone hired

yes so let's let's assume for the time

being that he has a designated appointee

yeah and yes when magical items present

themselves they're like the evaluator of

the user exactly right in fact let's say

it's au flabbergast what do you think

mr. Sibley as he looks at this black

garment I think it rather nicely and he

looks at it it's quite magical would you

accept say 20,000 for it

Evelyn's mouth does that little twitchy

thing where she's like you think like

mm-hmm

interesting I mean there is an affinity

between you know must well well I was

gonna say there's an affinity between me

and omen but let's be real he never

wrote back to me so maybe he hates me so

never mind we shouldn't invoke the whole

friendship think he's rather busy right

now

well of course he's running a very large

company if you say so

well then 20,000 is it's good don't get

me wrong there we did have another offer

that was make a deception check as the

cat with the monocle kind of leans and

looked at me very closely

that would be what was it deception yeah

32 okay another interested by Oh

he turns to mr. Sibley what do you think

of that and the cat and he says well the

most I'm authorized to offer for any

particular item is 25 and this is

imaginary item so it is worth that and

we can we roll like a intelligence check

to have any kind of like idea of how

much this would be worth

you really don't have a clue it's way

beyond the pale it was like the most

thing the most expensive garment you've

ever seen up to this point evil and it

was probably like Oh 150 gold pieces

okay and stir you just said a lot and

she doesn't know what money is even like

just one more thing to consider

you know before I mean it is Paulson's

cloak so ultimately you guys have to

come to the agreement but just one thing

to consider there is kind of a celebrity

element like an influencer moment that's

going on that man soon did wear this

cloak so there is a certain prestige so

it's not just the item it's kind of like

the idea you know just I thought like

well and the other thing is the the

other offer was it was technically for

25 so it's like kind of right on there

but it I don't know their entire like

their hookup system or like their

product placement but they also did

offer there they're kind of a

distributor of like wine and various

things so it was 25 plus you know a very

very heavy discount I also just wonder

if Jim dark magic would be like offended

if you underpaid for this item because

you know he wouldn't want to wear it

thinking like Pete with people thinking

you got it on the cheap so I just want

to make sure that you're like giving us

a fair market price for your own sake as

well or if this was even an item that

jim dark magic would be absolutely

furious was passed up even if he found

out that this item was you know being

sold in Waterdeep and it fell into

someone's hands that weren't his cuz

I'll certainly you know like talk to him

about it when I see him flabbergast will

look at the garment again turned to mr.

Sibley and say well as you say you have

received a competitive offer and well

you know it's would be bad for our

reputation to not be

competitive so I suppose we could dig

into the reserves and gather up 30

thousands I thought you were gonna say

50 cuz I just wouldn't want people

thinking he doesn't have any money fifty

thousand you know I mean it goes pale my

dear if I were to buy this for fifty

thousand I would most surely lose my job

well I wouldn't we don't want that at

all let me let me

yeah let's let's consult first think you

give us a quick moment please

you go off into a corner you see that he

becomes increasingly nervous the longer

we stay away from him so like we go into

the quorum just like he's having a chat

with his cat just like all right I'm

totally cool 30k but I'm just gonna like

pretend I'm talking to you and just like

you like okay like I'm gonna maybe we

could ask him to throw in like a bottle

of wine or something deal wine you never

I have a private inheritance and there's

some money tucked away in there I'm sure

we can put some of that into this and

I'll consider it a gift

birthday gift so Jim fifty thousand you

say done like don't don't look just yet

I'll take it for fifty thousand fifty k

50 big ones say it so here's what we're

gonna do I'm gonna count to three and we

look like look over to him judging Lee

like we just said something and then

don't really say anything just turn back

and pretend we're like still laughs I

could do that and I'm like talking I

just turn it on just like this I feel so

bad I can't do he's kind of pacing a

little bit and biting his thumb and

talking to himself and talking to mr.

Sibley maybe we should just give him the

clock fifty fifty thousand gold you say

yes yes hmm I believe that's fair truly

I wouldn't want Jim to go without a

birthday present

that's very true after all we we all

love Jim don't we I'm sure we will

mm-hmm I know nothing of this Jim but I

only hear good things and we just

haven't heard one heard many many things

about this Jim I've never met him but

I'm sure he's nice mm-hmm probably real

good at magic too I said you know what I

think we can part with it for her 55k

you see flabbergast he's he tries to say

something and the words just don't come

out of his mouth and then I will have to

think it over

well Dan I'll cover the extra five yeah

no you know what you know what that's

fair we'll do a little pitching for

mister yeah cuz I want this to be from

us to Jim as well that's true he does

deserve that yeah

snap on us fine 50k from you if you want

to call that a deal we'd be more than

happy I will have someone come by your

place to sign the paper look fantastic

can we can we shake on it yes he will

shake your hand

all right great you hey Jason

he'll take your address and you can

expect someone to come by there's all

kinds of paperwork and a contract that

is exchanged contract that's signed all

that kind of business

John insists upon it mmm 'lord drawn

well thank you you have been and some

dill somewhere in the multiverse omen is

having a bit of a heart attack right now

Jim's actually gonna get this roof I

sure hope so alright you so right now

great let's go alright alright you had

asked to get some champagne leaving

death and evylyn upstairs and strix his

room dear thought I closed the door

behind him for privacy and kind of

motion evil and to sit on the bed

meanwhile Dias still has like his packs

and like carrying things

evylyn and I realize we haven't really

gotten a chance to really talk in a long

time and there was something that you

said to me once that's always really

stuck with me and I wanted you to know

that I've always been thinking about it

and it wasn't something I ever ever

forgot a long time ago you had told me

that I was really good at taking a lot

of broken things and keeping them

together and I don't always feel that I

do I do my best I mean look at the house

but I try

but another thing evylyn is that I do

want to keep everything together and

it's important for everything to be home

and I know for a long time now

you haven't been whole and I wanted to

make sure that you were in Dias like

removes the cloak and shows off the

reforged light fall when you see this

weapon that you haven't seen intact

since it shattered in iron slag there's

a kinship to it but reflected in its axe

blades just briefly or your parents

faces death will kind of like walk over

to evil and yeah really kind of go down

to one unit to kind of present this

weapon and just say this has always been

a part of you and you've been far away

from it for far too long but evil and

also want you to know this is about a

tool the one thing that can strike

through the darkness has always been the

light within you you'll hand her life

all know you're muted what you didn't

hear me yeah okay you know even it's

usually very fast to act and bubbly

but you see she's overcome and you see

her hand slowly start reaching toward

the axe but then what death just said to

her really sinks in and she looks him in

the face and reaches over light fall to

just wrap him in a giant hug and says

you're the best friend I ever had and

I'm so thankful for you oh and yet gives

her a big hug back and she holds that

for well and she's like wow

it's tricks its tricks tricks as things

are flying everywhere and that's where

we'll stop uh still worked about that

perception check yeah I don't know what

it's worth for the perception check but

I was alright we will be back next week

for an all-new episode of dice camera

action but does anybody have any

announcements before we part I was

crying the second I even heard surprised
