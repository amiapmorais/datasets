the trash episode which as somebody said

is like every episode but this is a

special special SuperDuper trash episode

but before we jump into the action I've

got Anna Prosser Robinson and Alyssa

grant from Penny Arcade who have been

conspiring conspiring to do something

awesome and they're going to tell

they're gonna tell you about it and then

we're gonna boot Alyssa off and then I'm

gonna throw trash at everybody as I do

every week so as some of you may know

Alyssa and I are both producers and

producers tend to just like to think

about ways to break things you know and

to be like what's never been done before

what could we do that's bigger and

badder and crazier and especially when

those producers happen to be sitting and

drinking with people like with like Jeri

and Chris and and the rest of the crew

and and ideas are flowing sometimes

ideas come out that are big bad gems

that just don't seem to leave that

subtle they come out of your mouth and

sometimes they come out of your butt but

yeah but we were charged by the group

with like hey don't lose that one that

one might be good coincidentally a lot

of you in the waffle fam and the shadow

Council have have requested this very

thing numerous times since we came up

with this idea and even before and

because we love you and we want to make

you happy whenever you ask for something

we're like how can we make that happen

so as we approach our hundredth episode

Alyssa what are we gonna do we are going

to be doing a waffles ink streaming

weekend crossover event on July 14th and

15th where we will have several

different games running and we'll have

all eight players and two DMS they're

all at once

and it's going to be absolutely

fantastic it is gonna be so dope we're

gonna do four games that are crossover

games so we're gonna play with players

from both C team and dice camera action

at the same time that's happening on

Saturday and then on Sunday we will do a

full crew

crossover which as far as I know I I

don't think I've ever seen that done

before where it like jumps really

certainly not with two DMS yeah it's

gonna be a full table and and all of

this to be clear is happening in person

we will be live together at the Penny

Arcade studios in Seattle and all of us

are really really excited about it we

hope you guys are too and it will be

live streamed and it will be recorded

and as all of our episodes are so if you

can't watch us on the stream you can

catch us afterwards awesome

congratulations that's what we've been

hinting at forever

that's what Jerry was talking about when

he said that watch out when Alyssa and I

are together and that's what we've been

sending you wiggly eyebrow gifts about

for quite some time it's so true

alright well thank you guys so much I'm

very excited to see you guys in person

in a few weeks so thanks for inviting us

over to your office yeah great we

promise not to ruin it I mean we'll

Paris to try

[Laughter]

previously indice camera action the the

character is befriended a storied hero

named Magnus Burnside's who gave them or

entrusted them with an estate in water

deep which they have settled into here

at the end of winter going into spring

to kick things off I'd like so some time

has passed say some number of days and

or weeks so Spring has sort of slid into

your lives

the last of the snow has gone from water

deep and things are starting to warm up

a little bit and it's a beautiful spring

morning

what is your wake-up morning routine and

who wants to start you're all settled

that yours all settled in in your estate

oh we are yeah Chris would it be fair to

say that during this downtime dear

mister since they had to do for a few

days

oh my yes told the rest the party

nothing big deal just somehow just some

housecleaning 'he's gotta do a while

back in Waterdeep mm-hmm so he bet he's

back from that now all right his his

pouch is a little heavier from that but

I guess you keep that to yourself for

the time being no that went to a

bakeware it is safely story all right

then a bank in water deep uh I mean if

it happens to be one of the red larch

I'll just do it there but there you can

find a small place in red larch but if

you want security he probably wanted in

water deep damn it nothing is secure

with you Chris Perkins yeah well put in

water deep okay this is fine now Italy

saw me leave with it right most of the

banks in water deep are basically

controlled by trustworthy noble families

who have basically been licensed by the

Lords of Waterdeep to own and run banks

they provide their own security and

whatnot so it's all top-notch their

reputations being on the line of course

you can lock even can put your and for

those who don't know jared is alluding

to an adventure that deaath went on that

brought them into contact with some

members of acquisitions Inc C team out

in the small village of red large which

you can see over on their YouTube

channel right that right now we're on

traditional watch this show right now

but after this or any other time that

you have some free time feel free to

check that out to see what D s was up to

D F what is your wake up ur team I yes

wakes up unusually early compared to

most other people almost as if the

moment he's awake he's immediately alert

in not he's noticed that whatever room

he's taken as his in this state there's

probably a window of some kind and

usually there's like a cat on the

windowsill cleaning itself in the wee

hours of the morning occasionally you'll

hear it at night screaming from some

distant rooftop but it likes to camp out

here periodically and just glare

- neat so his room upstairs will say

he's in the not the master bedroom

probably not know but whatever bedroom

he has taken okay it's not his own Strix

likely has also watch yourself in there

- yeah she's in a corner somewhere

there's an attic attic bedroom with a

fireplace and two windows on the highest

level of the house oh yeah I want that

that goes up to the turret peak the

turret is actually separate at that

point it detached from the house at that

level okay gotcha yeah up in the attic

sounds correct cool yeah so he he stays

in that bedroom that way from up there

at the highest point you can also see

him over most of Waterdeep yeah he's

actually looking north over a large

portion of the North Ward which has

walls enclosing it beyond that is the

vast countryside yeah every morning he

does some calisthenics

keep himself limber and kind of yeah

goes up going and every morning he her

ears during that he dons his equipment

every morning he counts how many keys he

has left to make sure he's gotten every

single one still there and then it's

down to patio creaky stairs yep down to

you whatever food is prepared mm-hmm

careful tough not to wake the others

until they are ready to get up you have

discovered as have the rest of you that

there are what appear to be a number of

unseen servants of some kind that that

basically do things in the house so DF

you probably have some stuff already

prepared for you by the time you're

downstairs now that a routine has been

established okay we're really like used

to them and accepting at this point yeah

you you've sort of gotten accustomed to

deacon past a unseen servant with a

broom that can be a little bit

challenging in the upstairs Hall but

yeah

you always try to give that as wide a

berth as possible yeah yeah so he'll go

down down to like where the tap room

area is from the pantry in the first

floor I get himself a modest breakfast

usually something very very simple

you've never been happy with how cold

the tap room is in the mornings yeah

it's still provided a simple breakfast

that one that doesn't take a whole lot

of time to prepare unless for some

reasons Trix has already has one made

for him or like prepared something from

the night before okay

probably something from the night before

just just covered with like a

handkerchief or something that you can

put out dirty who's next I guess I can

be Strix cuz I'm sure after like all of

the like stomping and stair creaking she

accept everyone I assumed yeah it's

actually pretty quiet oh she's always an

alert though right give me some credit

yeah he's probably he's probably pretty

quiet but the house the house does sort

of groan and make and make noises yeah

so she was like a pile of like who even

though I was like in the corner which

I'm sure that DF has been like don't

sleep on the floor and she's like oops

and she's like on the floor in the

corner and I'm gonna assume she

sometimes sits too close to the fire cuz

she can't feel it

so sometimes she'll just catch on fire

at night okay it's just like start

smouldering yep she probably also hears

things in the night like what she thinks

they're like worms or something boring

through the woods at walls it's all in

her head but oh well so when she wakes

up uhm I guess if she would just make

sure that she has all of her fake all of

her body parts and that they haven't

been stolen at night okay so shoot make

sure that she has her hands he's just

crazy okay and you just kind of do a

circle in front of a mirror mhm yeah

exactly

and she'll like wipe away her protection

circle at night when she's like drawing

around like where everyone sleeps

probably everyone in the house she's

done that like every night right

probably has to get some bend out of her

tail yeah exactly just like it's like

it's like a little like zigzag yeah and

she'll probably have taken her hat off

and probably like her cloak and like

her like bigger items because she

doesn't need those to sleep with so

she'll put all those back on and does

she just sort of picked them up off the

floor does she have a place to stash

them um you know I think she would have

a place to stash them like maybe a loose

floorboard or something like she might

hide like Oliver looks like an empty

trunk that would hold everything like

everything everything is under the

floorboard next to it okay yeah you

noticed as you've noticed peer out as

you've lifted up the floorboard to that

give it enough effort you're not that

big a person you could probably crawl

through the floors of this house if you

really wanted to or had to noted and I'm

assuming like she might have like set up

some sort of likes

I don't know likes like something in the

turret cuz turrets are kind of mage

tower II so like she might have like

taken some books from the library and

like put them in the turret and like

some Scrolls to get to the turret there

is a bedroom directly underneath this

one you could have made some sort of

trapdoor to drop from this bedroom into

the lower one or you could just go

downstairs to the lower bedroom which

may or may not be occupied by paltin I

guess we'll find out it's got a private

bath off of it so oh yeah well she she

she had been meaning to give something

back to paltin okay so she's gonna take

that way anyway okay so then the morning

well she'll probably go downstairs and

either make talk to deaath and talk

about different ways that they're gonna

die and blah blah blah and then check

the basement she's probably got some

potions going on in the basement or

something weird or whatever yeah she's

probably got like a brewing trestle

table with some brewing stuff on it

another thing exactly yeah yeah and she

goes down there and just like throws

some garbage in there and then just then

rat like rats keep getting down there

but she doesn't seem to mind she just

sort of kicks them aside as she makes

her way through the table the other rats

are fine and so she'll check on all

those and then she'll she'll go back

upstairs and pass through strange smell

come on this beaker and she'll pass

through Paulson's

I'm just assuming his Paulson's room

yeah that's back upstairs on the third

floor okay good and oh also every

morning she makes sure she still has

magic she's like yeah okay I'm still

about cleaning off of Pontins bedroom is

the turret and it goes out okay an extra

level and it's probably I'm sure

evylyn uses the turret too but Strix is

kind of put like a cousin Simon's sort

of probably into the turret so there's a

fight between Simon yeah soon if Paul

turns in there

Strix is gonna walk up to him what are

you doing paulsen are you in there

so paltin what's your morning routine

like we're so we're just we're just kind

of going over morning routines yeah okay

so paltin is just like all right what's

good guys is calm here no we're gonna do

out I'm gonna take you through a day in

the life right now he's got like a

little window like a little hit like I'm

live on which right

so what I like to do is I like to I like

to wake up you know I have my morning

ritual I like to have a drink and then

you know like after I have a drink I

like to you know follow that I like to

chase that with some wine that's pretty

sick you know sometimes I do a morning

workout and but like typically I just

have a third drink you know oh do check

this out like walk down to the bar like

right dude dude you're not you're not

gonna believe this all right check this

out so this bar I'm pretty sure this

place is haunted but like the ghosts are

chill so like we don't really like you

know we don't we don't bug him about

actually help us out it's pretty sick

anyway um then I like to I like to have

another drink which is tight oh this is

a fun thing so there's some sick pranks

that go on in this house but don't tell

anybody but um so twice a we like what

I'm trying to do is twice a week in the

middle of the night I like to sneak in a

Diaz room and like you know like like

try and hide one of his keys because I

like totally freaks it out it's so funny

but don't tell them I said wait wait

that's about it guys so you know like

thanks for giving us our see you sort of

catch a glimpse of death in the

background sitting at the bar eating the

meal that night before a sort of shoots

you look a wee shoutouts for all the

bits thanks guys killing it right now go

back to your room so Strix can give you

the thing and then I go back to my room

and okay I'm gonna go back to my room so

we can further the plot put on my pants

the end of the stream she's like

everyday flexing oh yeah I Strix had

forgotten that she was hoarding one of a

one of the things she found in Paulson's

like remains and like she'd noticed that

he was looking for it apparently and she

like found it like a week later like

tucked somewhere inside of her robe she

was like oh it's probably smelly sorry

but it's like it's like a little it was

like if she thought it was evil ins but

then she realized it came from faults

and stuff but it's a little necklace

with a what a cog on it and evil and

signet ring and she doesn't know where

she was like it was weird and so she's

gonna find paltin and be like I think

this is yours

but I find it strange that

you have this Paul him just like

snatches it and he's like I'm sorry it's

smelly now where where did you get this

it was in your in your dust but because

there was just so much dust and there

was so it just ended up in my robe I'm

sorry

you know how it is there's a lot it's

it's it's it's fine don't don't worry

about it you like tucks it away

I think Paul tonight as you tuck it away

you see your hand

disintegrate just sort of turn to powder

and then your whole arm disintegrates

and turns to powder

Parkins I don't feel so good and then

suddenly all of you seems to turn to

powder and then you collapse and then

and then you wake up and you're like not

again that's a good prank is he just on

the floor did he pass out yeah he like

got up into did his morning routine and

then just sort of passed out on the

floor and you can see just sort of

hanging on a dresser doorknob a dresser

knob that thing that necklace with a

signet ring which was given to you like

days earlier by strikes cool cool I

tried to make it nice but you know this

is like the third night third morning in

a row where you've had essentially a

disintegration moment districts ask him

about it when she gave it back to him

yeah she didn't see it it didn't

actually happen that way no oh no she

didn't see the disintegration I mean he

hadn't he had a dream about strix giving

her the signet ring and then

disintegrated in the dream know when

strix actually handed it to him yes she

asked him yes yes actually that actually

did happen yeah well she was kind of

like just what does this mean does it

mean and I'm sure Politan was like oh

wait so he's just like all right Perkins

I got a level with you I'm having a hard

time keeping track it what like what

actual timeline we're in right now it is

very disorienting is hystrix telling the

real this is later this is later okay

so am I just in the room alone yes

actually you see you see the door open

and then Simon just sort of comes in and

he's got like a cookie on a plate and he

just goes into his turret for like 50

years and the the things still the

necklace is still hanging it is just

hanging on the wall yeah he just like

takes it off mm-hmm he's just like

looking at it it's like

I'm gonna put it away okay

it's away now Anna

Evelyn's springtime morning routine

birds are chirping the sunlight is

streaming through at an angle

you've probably claimed the master

bedroom on the third floor perhaps

because it's got a huge private bath and

a big fireplace when she ran in the

house that was of course the first

private bath job found yes like right

when we got the house right but she was

very apologetic at first she's like just

anyone else want some I mean I don't

need to take the master bedroom if

anyone all the time take it you can okay

if you insist they went up and looked at

it oh that's all the towels were damp so

they're like no I imagine it has like a

big like canopy bed and so in the

mornings

evylyn actually gets up really early to

like train every morning but you'd

expect that she'd sit up and be like oh

like Cinderella like birds dripping and

stuff but actually part of the reason

she gets up early is she's just like

stupid in the morning like she's just

she wakes up like like princess on and

frozen like hair everywhere like like

drool and stuff imagine sometimes she

could she wakes up and when like strix

is going to bed yeah she got assets up

and like looks around and kind of like

dumb for a sec and just kind of you know

and then just kind of like puts herself

together the rest of you here having

anybody seen my car she doesn't want to

interact with anyone and then she show

go let's see she doesn't have access to

the turret but she has a big window so I

think what she does is probably like hop

set like you know hops out with her

flying boots onto the roof and does some

calisthenics and we know some Sun

Salutations and works out in the morning

kind of gets herself all ready he says

her morning prayers does some like you

know surveillance flies around and so

she gets gets the blood pumping and

everything to the point

by the time anyone else is waking up

she's like perfectly coughed and already

and just like chipper and skips down the

stairs like she just woke up but she's

been awake for a couple hours right

praying and training and working out all

right no one ever actually sees her in

her getting prepared state she's just

always looking at great and perfect yeah

oh also like right when paltin wakes up

that one time he's just like looking

around things like why are my stats

still gray oh also I wondered if Strix

can also document the amount of ghosts

oh yeah you can basically record any

time you see a sighting and what room

sort of that little hash marks check out

like to check off how many times you've

seen activity in the library or the den

or the cat or the common room which is

probably being trained turned into some

sort of training center or something

you'll have to decide to do what to do

with all the extra space that you have

you have a big attic storage room you

have a large library slash study and you

have this big common room and very large

den attached to one another is it zoned

for like having a bakery possibly so it

based on what you all that you've

learned about it is the structure is

known locally as troll skull Manor

because it is on troll skull alley which

is this wide alley in North Ward which

has which all these residences and

businesses face on to and it's actually

got like a little mini market there on

certain time certain periods of the day

there's a blacksmith nearby there's a a

sort of a garden floral center on on

troll skull alley on some other places

other establishments as well as private

residences this place has been a tavern

it has been a bed-and-breakfast it has

been at one time in the past an

orphanage

to the best of your recollection so it

is served a number of purposes and can

be both residential and commercial

okay so Strix is also kind of in sussing

out where the best like bakery and or

like coven areas are okay you're not

gonna find too much of that in the North

Ward where you guys are because beyond

troll skull alley it's almost all the

states and businesses with a few

scattered up sort of higher-end places

like high-end bookstores and places

where you can buy fancy pauses and

things like that yeah do I think the

ghosts of the orphans just doesn't it

question so what you're able to make out

is that these you don't think Strix that

these are ghosts that some wizard

basically cast permanent unseen servants

okay carry out specific tasks throughout

this edifice so they're all sort of

created by powerful magical spells they

function identically to the unseen

servant spell except that they are

permanent okay that's disappointed that

they're not ghosts

[Laughter]

evylyn was able to ascertain choosing

her paladin's divine sense was able to

ascertain pretty dead loitering around

in here for the phret house I want to

say for the record for the stream in the

chat that we do have like an actual map

of our Manor and this is what we're

using - oh you're already writing on it

I was just like using in my head no I'm

printing this out and I'm going to mark

down we're putting our furniture I also

wanted to note that evil in' is super

into home improvement now because they

have their own place and so she's like

getting up we know a really good

carpenter yeah she's she's setting up

all these like insta perfect little

places and she likes to like you know

arrange things and she's all about like

the local buzz on trends of like you

know colors and plants and things so

she's like almost to an annoying degree

both home decorating and also like

remodeling so I imagine that some

mornings they wake up because she's like

hammering something on the outside of

the house like she decided to add

shutters

this is gonna be a constant fight

because Strix is going to constantly add

figs that evil ones gonna hate yeah like

that's that's so last season like in

like I can already assume she's already

found some like mounted head of like

some creature will put it into the lake

Oh No maybe she saved the the mind

flayer head and mounted it and put it

always tries to be nice and encouraging

about it but she's always like you know

that's a such a cool art piece but maybe

it would just fit better with like the

aesthetic of like the attic bedroom

maybe there is at the very highest floor

when you grow up to the Attic the stairs

climbed to a short hallway that dead

ends that have doors on either side to

the bedrooms in the storage area there

is a spot on that wall at the top of the

stairs where I can just glare down it

goes right there we'll just make that

face into like a you know a tentacle

aesthetic I suppose yeah how many

lightning rods is too many lightning

rods either it's like don't you have

like paladin stuff to do like why are

you messing up our barber Castle for the

record DF has actually expressed almost

an uncomfortableness with the manor kind

of give me a hint that you feels like

it's almost too much or it's more than

they ever possibly need and anything and

everything he gets for his own sake in

the manor is small and practical well I

speak bringing him things that he

doesn't want and just leaving them up

yeah I think that's probably part of the

reason for Evelyn's home improvement too

is that as soon as she were to like

actually settle down she would maybe

feel like how did we get here and should

like do we even deserve this so she's

like she's making it like a project in

order to kind of it seems like she's

always working on the house I feel like

she's just gonna turn there like ruin to

a hoard or a roof it's like just like

little things from the garbage like how

much cool garbage is in water deep right

like you'll find all kinds of stuff so

she's probably just like going through

every

like neighbors garbage and they'll

probably like chase her away and think

that she's just like an urchin but she

like runs back into the house the there

is a knock on the main door which leads

into the taproom hide I got it you pull

open the door mm-hmm

you see two gentlemen standing on your

stoop one is a short pudgy fellow with

tinted spectacles and a mustache and

beard and he's wearing wizard robes he

stands next to a tall lanky fellow with

graying red hair a long beak nose and

kind of a kind of a bit of a shambles of

a city watch uniform kind of like a city

watch uniform that's been kind of worn

out and threadbare and maybe even gone

out of style and the the pudgy wizard

says hello my good man I'm Barnabas

blessed wind

inspector Barnabas blasts wounds I'm

hiding behind the bar as I listen to

this and whinny I hear blast wind here

is my stalwart companion retired

sergeant safe Cromley over the city

watch are you guys are you guys here to

fix the plumbing oh no we don't

represent the celeries and plumbers

guild

no no I'm with the watchful order of me

just sand protectors magic you hear from

behind the bar we have received some

reports among residents in this

neighborhood that one of the residents

of your establishment has been

plundering their garbage we've been sent

to investigate yes we've been sent to

investigate ah Strix and people here see

ya no you just you see you're like pop

up from the bards paltin outs and she's

like you outed me hello fellow magic

users

no no sergeant Cromley is named magic

user oh he's a god an investigative God

public servant indeed madam

oh yes and so you've been stealing

garbage madam no garbage can't be stolen

just as a roll you're a wizard you say I

mean I used magic yes but I'm not a whit

I'm not a wizard and yes you are not

registered with the watchful majors and

protectors I don't know that word why I

don't know a reg it seems like she's

like panicked looking at pulse it like

can even Wilson and she has like her

hair tied up in a scarf and she has like

a tool in one hand and she looks like

Instagram perfect like home and she she

just walks in and she's like yes and she

like throws the toe no no no we're in

trouble

it's troubled and she just flounces in

in front of strix and it's like welcome

to our home man oh thank you it's rather

charming oh thank you we've just made a

few I do like what she does it'll be

done and he says you wouldn't happen to

have a glass of milk or something will

do it's a little parched

would you like some things I'm gonna no

I'm fine thank you

I'll go to the bar and get him a drink

okay so strikes we'll walk up to them I

kind of around evil I'm like okay uh I

have not registered as a magic person

for here I'm sure it's just an oversight

we can have that taken care of and do

order what what is there a test I don't

know there's no test if you're a wizard

you're a wizard and

I didn't read it from you better router

how do you learn the magic it's it's

that you can cast the magic and so

should water the about need of your

services you would be drafted into

employment no I already have employment

by oh stop talking would you Paul walks

back two cups because one firm self yeah

and hands the other one okay Cheers oh

he taped rise up just like yeah don't

don't chug this dude if you if you're

driving

today mmm let's call it that can I do an

insight check on these guys to see if

they're lying sure I'm just like sixteen

they seem sincere you can see Barnabas

he basically tells you that it is the

law for wizards to register but there's

no prescribed you have to do it by you

know ten days or whatever so typically

people do if you're a new arrival to the

city do get around to it and you you

remember something to that effect but it

actually does really only apply to mages

and wizards not so much to sorcerers and

warlocks you can opt out all right but

they have no way of knowing if you're

one thing or the other and since you

referred to yourself as a wizard and he

kind of assumes that's what you are so

he says all you have to do is go to a

watchful order of mages and protectors

post or you can actually register with

him now and he can take your fee and

then you're a member and then if they

have need of you to help defend the city

they'll call upon you but otherwise you

just basically do what you do the

watchful order has no meetings or other

obligations other than they have to be

willing to defend the city when called

upon right she's just gonna turn to

everyone and I didn't I don't know his D

F in there too or does he upstairs

he's a problem see now idiots out

running morning errands right now so

he's not home at all cool all right

in that case if you want to register now

Barnabas tells you that it will cost you

twenty five gold pieces and there ain't

I just kind of look at him and I'm like

I look at palton it's basically a

one-time payment I'm like Walton if we

can be wizard friends that means more

Wizards can be our friends indubitably

fantastic even though I'm not really a

wizard

I don't really I I learned I know magic

I didn't learn magic Oh hand him the

gold okay as in like I was given Maz

he's giving him the goal of him like I'd

never read a book about magic I in fact

I'm actually really bad at it role-p

he's also just like the guy he got

trained he's like hey what do you think

I just like came up with it on the spot

when he said no if you like it

it's it's something see what is it good

it's novel and ripens full of something

hold on I like swipe it and I'll go back

okay evening mixologist have you watched

it on his which channel he does mixology

streams sometimes alright yeah sup Strix

is like yeah yes a sorcerer that's what

I am a sorcerer I sorry I forgot the

word for a second because I don't really

I don't really refer to myself in magic

terms of you trash well I mean there's a

lot of trash here so and there's I just

like to find used to live on the streets

here and just hide in the corner and so

I used to eat from the trash so I figure

there's lots of things in the trash that

you can use like important things and

good things and things that you can give

your friends maybe you couldn't help us

with a small little matter we've been

called to investigate the situation then

it's become a widespread problem

throughout the city namely piles of

trash handling around on their own and

terrorizing the locals oils of trash

ambling around animated and threatening

the citizenry whose animating trash well

that's what we don't know perhaps you

can help us we've caught one of the

creatures trapped it is aware maybe you

can identify something about it its

nature that would lend some perspective

or guide us in the direction that would

help us find whoever's responsible for

this I am sorry oh that sounds fine I

can I can do that I know magic what do

you think evil and should I help do you

want me to help Waterdeep of course

we'll help you to you don't you do it by

yourself I don't want to go by myself

we've trapped the creature in one of the

theaters in great I'm gonna be honest

with you that sounds absolutely

disgusting and I don't want to touch it

but I'll help you as best I can

it is very disgusting and it reeks a lot

yeah a group adventure great adventure

Boulton walks back he's like alright I

tweaked it try that rather saucy tasty

drink what did we do to it I had it I I

added I tweaked the recipe a little bit

I call it a I call it a white Peruvian

no all right yes he will he will he will

down it Cheers

yes he places the empty glass down on

the bar I think even has a bad habit of

yelling for people in the house sending

spell we can get one cuz it's such a big

house she's not used to being this far

from everybody so she's just yelling up

the stairs dad the whole time the

Barnabas and safe have been here you've

seen no unseen servant activity Oh

interesting huh and you haven't really

had visitors drop by yet so I don't like

that I know sergeant Cromley sort of

looks around says are you planning to

open up this establishment again soon oh

maybe do you like pies yeah I do

yes in fact and I'm rather miss it on my

rounds well we might you don't have

rounds anymore my good man you're

retired not with you or not uh we might

open it up there'll be fun Paulsen's

clearly coming up with drink ideas yes I

should say you could market this is

what's you wait we don't have any money

we can market this it's a great idea

okay you guys Mac said bars liked my

ideas now it's construction yeah we

would that would be nice for us to have

money but we don't really usually have

money yeah you see site you see Simon

come down the stairs no sir stop look at

you and then go back up the stairs and

Barnabas turns around and looks toward

the stairs and thought he heard

something but nothing there Oh waffles

is probably in the other room snoring -

yeah probably in the den I would say on

the first floor a big roomy space for

her

yeah I'm Strix has been like cleaning up

her poop every morning and shoveling

a window yeah yeah she'll she'll just

kind of be like I mean I want to help

maybe I could meet the black staff again

laughs is so cool though you know the

black staff I don't know I met her we

had a quite a few just a couple of

disasters mm fortnight's are you but

yeah evylyn paulten and Strix you can

all make insight checks oh I got a I got

an 18 okay yeah you meter Dana

sorry I was muted 15 all right with a 15

and an 18 Strix and evylyn you can tell

that both Barnabas and safe Cromley

exchange a little look when she says

when she starts talking about the black

staff like they're dubious that she has

met the black staff but they're not

there it polite etiquette dictates that

they not say anything more about it they

don't think she actually met her no they

think this might be a tall tale Oh like

you saying you're a wizard when you're

not but the but the 18 Strix you

suddenly get a sense that they are they

may have come here for another purpose

in addition to asking for your help to

identify the origins of this trash

monster and they haven't broke haven't

broke that part of the conversation yet

all right as soon as she kind of like

feels that she'll kind of just like

their eyes on their own mm-hmm and

she'll just be like why'd you really

come here cutters if you're only here to

talk about trash monsters I think yet

enough wizards could handle that you

don't need my help for that he's a

clever one she's very clever and

Barnabas is yes of course let me let me

tell you the other reason why we've come

so we know through our investigation

this place is owned by one Magnus

Burnside's of Neverwinter and in

addition we know that he hasn't sold the

place so still owns it so he has to be

renting it to you no doubt well there

have been sightings of him and possibly

you making a way to and from the sewers

of the city and there was an incident in

the sewers recently that led does an

explosion that was heard and felt by

people up above and attached to that

incidents involving you and members of

the dung sweepers guild who have

described one or more of you in great

detail suggesting that you have had some

business down in the sewers of late

run-ins with the dong sweepers guild

leading to some sort of violence so

you're hoping to save the city from the

scourge of the brain-eater things yeah

we did that I was hoping you would say

that anyway yeah we killed we killed a

mine flare in the sewers the explosions

were though my fireballs

we are quite willing to put aside any

possible infractions of local laws and

disturbing the peace and what not if

you're willing to help us with this

trash monster which you already are

hence I didn't bring up that earlier

point well we saved everyone that in

mind thumbs up my flare he's got a wall

up there the dung sweepers killed the

dong sweepers killed locked us I there's

some shady the doves dung sweepers go

there's something going on with it's not

their fault they have the you know the

things in their brains yeah they have

the things in their brains when an abyss

and save probably kind of look at each

other with that familiar look like oh

here's another here we go again they

weren't you know about the things and

the brains like oh yeah you know I know

they sort of look at each other puzzled

I dunno what to mind Claire is no no not

that but for now let's do it selectively

our you know what intellect of our is

they work for they can also work for

mine we there were also three undead be

holders down there there was a lie we

killed a lot water deep would be of way

worse shape if we hadn't to kill them oh

very good

whose how we deal with the trash monster

there's a clear and present danger we

will all go and deal with the trash

monster we have to wait for Diaz to get

back from his morning chores so sit at

the bar and let Paulson get you drunk

all right they sit at the bar and wait

for you do you have what business do you

have it's probably just some

like getting whatever supplies are

needed at the Manor

food stores and the like I have a need

additional glasses or wine skins maybe

maybe bike potentially also checking out

nearby bounty boards or help-wanted ads

or listening listening in on the on the

gossip stairs yeah you can you can you

can listen to the gossip stairs you can

take some notes from the boards you can

also pick up for like a copper piece

each some of the local broad sheets that

basically there are different there are

different kinds of broad sheets that are

sold in the city but basically there are

local news and gossip yeah all that to

try to collect as much information about

the current state of Waterdeep and the

overall atmosphere of the place and the

like right after a long cold icy winter

the general senses people are looking to

get sort of back the city is sort of

coming to life again

the rebels are starting up again the

trade is that the gates are opening to

trade the ships are coming in and out of

the harbor again that's nice that's

always good people are looking forward

to troll tide which is a springtime

festival where they celebrate the end of

the second troll war when trolls threw

themselves at the walls of Waterdeep and

we're set ablaze and burned and driven

off and killed and massacred people

celebrate by lighting wooden effigies of

trolls on fire and watching them burn to

ash while children run around in troll

masks and harangue adults for treats

this sounds like the best time in my

life like the last time we were at a

festival where children were running

around

oh yeah I think Strix also gave DF a

list of pi supplies to get from the

store yeah he's like collecting bad he's

also collecting a basket

yes small material components for spells

maybe some cleaning supplies or perfumes

or whatever the heck that

evylyn wants fresh fruits and vegetables

okay

etc yep and yes so yeah then it's at

some point he'll return back to the

manor however long the FEL after

Barnabas and okay safe have been there

there are a couple as you make your way

through troll scale alley there's

activity some children running around

playing some halfling a couple musicians

getting set up on a corner to basically

score some coin you can see a

well-dressed noblewoman

making her way with her valet she's

looking around it's signs like she

hasn't been in this particular part of

the city before but it's looking for

something in particular and he sort of

slips past you and gives you a smile and

her valet says something it must be up

ahead man and they keep going and you

make it back and as soon as you enter

you see that you've got company yeah

Susan's entering in like holding the

bags of groceries or whatever deaath

sees paulten serving drinks

evylyn that trying her best converse

with them and Strix doing the same and

probably slightly panicked on her face

she looks like yeah it's a deer walking

it just oh no we're going to kill some

trash monsters and it's okay that we

killed all that stuff in the sewer I

mean I guess it was okay because we

saved everyone but I'm glad you're home

Cromley Paul walks up with a company I

also try this slosh slosh law puts down

a bag actually sips it just goes oh one

your best yet still need some tweaks but

I'm feeling it

you know they want us to kill a monster

from the trash

yeah it's do you have completely caught

up by this point no DF you've heard

rumors actually just this morning in

your gatherings that locals particularly

in the trades wards and the doc ward

have had encounters with what they claim

are shambling mounds of trash moving

often slowly enough that one can run

away from them but they sort of seem to

be pursuing people relentlessly through

town of late alright so this is a new

this is a relatively new development ok

so then like to Barnabas and what's the

name safe Seba safe Cromley safe okay

like sa Fe sa ETH let's see okay see dad

but sergeant Cromley will do okay so to

Barnabas and Cromley sounds like an

awesome law firm DF we'll just say so

you just need assistance and finding and

clearing out that these these trash

piles they tell you that they've they've

trapped one in a theater the prison

bright theater they're hoping that well

it should be destroyed but then they're

hoping that looking at it or studying it

somebody will be able to ascertain where

it came from and that's somebody they

hope is Strix oh well Strix is it is

that something that you think you can

help with I mean yeah I think so I know

magic can do it sounds like I mean I'm

definitely we get definitely

incapacitated and then we'll see what

happens from there you know magic and

you know trash it's perfect

Thank You evylyn your vehicle put like a

hand on ostriches shoulder to kind of

calm her a little bit and then turns

back to the other turn just says she can

do it thank you I can do it

and let's go I've been up for hours

you can see Barnabas gets off his stool

and immediately he starts to get a

little tipsy and but sergeant Cromley is

there to kind of brace him Lacy's Oh

Quinn yeah that those who catch up to

you yeah I guess let's try to catch

now we could do this Strix will assist

and then that way you know that we are

always always here should you need any

further assistance and we only mean the

best for water deep and magic assistance

and we've taught we've met the black

staff that's not a lie oh yeah we did

yeah see her whole outfits like inspired

by it

you see safe or sergeant Cromley uh

escort Barnabas through the door and

Barnabas says yes your story is starting

to sound more credible by the hour I

guess that's all we can get well bring

this bring us to this all right

I'll grab it you are led by them you all

hop in a coach that's been waiting out

of troll skull alley you can see the

driver looking somewhat impatient but

relieved when sergeant Cromley rounds

the corner with Barnabas and they assure

everybody inside

evylyn your floaty boots so you could

probably flutter alongside the coach if

you want to as it takes you from the

North Ward down into the trades ward to

the Brizendine dove a bit of a cramped

run-down theater it looks like it's had

it's been way past its heyday and is in

kind of in a state of early disrepair

but there are posters slapped to its

outside boards and its doors suggesting

that there are still things happening

there shows going on and you can see

that there are city watchmen actually a

city watch man and a city watch woman in

their full uniforms standing outside

each entrance they basically got the

place on lockdown don't worry we have a

trash expert coming in don't worry

like an expert sorcerer I'm sure these

to get his passage y-yes so you pile out

sergeant Romney says Oh one thing we

have to warn you about and that is that

this place is haunted Oh for crying out

loud come on no no there's nothing

nothing to distress over but the owner

Malcolm Prizm bright is a ghost you see

and he haunts the place and he welcomes

people to his shows and then he just

sort of lets them carry on but uh nice

harmless really I just didn't want to

alarm him oh good

strikes is just like I lived in burrow

via for 50 years I'll take care of it

[Laughter]

you can see posters for a play called

blood wedding plastered all over the

outside of this and you can see little

write-ups that you can sort of piece

together that suggests it must be a play

about love jealousy and death the story

of a young woman brought to a castle by

a count only to fall in love with his

younger brother a man of faith play like

performing art and stuff so she like

fluttered up to the poster like and then

she sees what it is and she's like yes

and blast winner says oh yes I've seen

it it's all rather good if predictable

he murders his brother on his wedding

day and pursues the bride who hell's

herself off the battlements and oh well

I'm spoiling everything

anyway the county cursed by the gods and

transformed into some sort of creature

of the night but isn't there like a band

of plucky adventurers who like stop the

wedding and my plucky adventurers didn't

actually stop anything are you sure

there was a lucky advance

anyway a safe Cromley sort of waives the

guards aside for you leading into the

darkened interior of this

Oh what was the ghost name again I

forgot Malcolm

Brisbane bright okay so as soon as Strix

will walk in and there's open

like hey Malcolm prison bright yeah as

soon as you sort of go into the lobby

and you start shouting out his name yeah

you can see this dead owner manifest

before you and he appears dressed in a

suit his hair unkempt holding a top hat

a ghostly top hat in his hands almost

like he expects like handouts or

something but he's not holding it out to

actually get a handout he's just holding

it that way and but he appear lized

appears before you floating spectrally

in the air of this darkened Lobby and he

gives you what you could only imagine is

sort of a default welcome that he said

hundreds if not thousands of times all

right

I have a vial of ghost ectoplasm on my

person so I'm gonna take that and just

notice harried visit diminish you gentle

sirs and beautiful ladies for I am your

friendly host what fine art we have

wrought for you this day we know you're

a ghost sir hold up like the vial of

ghostly ectoplasm see I've met other

ghosts they're all nice Oh ghost see I

had some ghosts in my Hut it's fine okay

these sort of glances at it but doesn't

pay it much mind just just here to

handle your trash problem we're here to

help all right

beyond the ghost of Britain bright you

can see stairs leading deeper healing up

in deeper into the structure and as you

follow them and there's carpeting

covering them they lead you to the main

theatre auditorium which has descending

rows of plank seating leading down to a

wooden stage covered with all manner of

fixed set dressings that look like

castle walls

and make perception checks everyone yeah

11 I also got 1122 good 14 okay with a

14 oh well actually anything higher than

a 10 you can smell the putrid stench of

garbage it's not overwhelming but it's

clear there's clearly something here

rotting and stinking up the place with a

roll of 15 or higher you can hear

something shambling around among the

sets on the stage but you can't see

anything so it must be behind one of the

pieces oh yeah there's something here I

hear it that they said they'd had this

thing captured they had it contained oh

they had a quarantine nut yeah heck okay

what one doesn't hear anything I assume

she's busy like playing around on the

set princess you should start floating

around on the set oblivious to where

this creature might be the rest d/f you

you hear it enough to know she's close

enough to be in danger

evylyn come back it's wrong okay

dee Ethel contri to point out where he's

hearing it from a strategist Rick's okay

yeah she can is can she fly above the

sets on her broom to kind of look down

uh to an extent it's all very dark you

have dark vision that helps yeah as you

fly up high among the the catwalks

and peered down make a perception check

alright with advantage because you know

you're you're a trash

30:20 okay you can see a large mound of

trash has basically broken its way into

a coffin and is scouring its insides and

Kassel Ravenloft are you are you are you

are in the seventh castle Raven law

there are even there are even hanging

among you up here Strix bats on little

wires with little sort of articulated

puppet wings so that they can the wings

can go up and down and these things can

basically be moved across the stage like

they're flapping around he's like trying

to find the throne to like so you could

just like sit there yeah and in fact

there is that there is a throne I've

seen it up there that looks just like

the throne on the cover of cursive

straud it's this looks like it belongs a

chair : what he can like find a prop

wine glass so you can sit like this it

might am I in the chair you are totally

in the chair with your prop wine glass

palton sits now it's like hey guys look

eat these ah yes is the only one taking

this seriously thanks Lucy Astrix you

see this you see the trash monster sort

of moving away from the coffin and

trying to crawl sneak up behind palton

in his chair the trash is behind you you

sort of turn and get up and you see

busting out through the window behind

the chair is this stinking heaving mound

of rotting vegetation paper and other

waste excrement everything just jumbled

up into this

massive shambling mound that stands

about eight feet tall

oh god it's massive yeah even goes ah

deep Ling is here let's roll initiative

[Laughter]

it was funny though 8:8 first tricks are

you fun sorry ten first ten four strokes

do you at seven okay

I'm caught up in this performance I have

five five oh my gosh

oh wow we're all terrible okay yeah all

right the trash monster surprisingly

Louis goes first and sort of throws

itself over the chair at palton and

makes to slam attacks against him no not

the chair alright the first one misses

royally doesn't come close the chair

kind of falls forward because of the

mass of this creature pushing against it

and it kind of stumbles and trips in a

way it's second attack is 23 to hit and

you know sad hits okay Alton's just like

on Candide wait yeah and so you are

thwap by garbage and take a total of 13

points of damage

okay holes are you okay do you feel

descent degree he's like no you've

pissed him off the chalice just come

through the garbage oh you up

friend mistress what do you do oh my god

do I think that dispel magic might work

on this make our comet check okay for

free no nope I don't know

careful we can't set the stage on fire

you don't know I don't know

well I okay I don't know

so I'm gonna try it I'm gonna try me

like well I'm gonna try all right you

attempt to cast the spell magic on it

nothing happens based on based on the

result you think this is not a magical

effect but an actual creature a

construct Oh someone's making these yeah

that's important to know that's what

we're here to set to you to find out

good job Strix thanks I appreciate the

encouragement all right

that's Strix and you're still up in the

catwalks right she's on her broom yeah

yeah okay

next up is evylyn she's like she she

turns the sort of smelly on high burn Oh

she tries to stab it alright

she flaps down tries to run it through

uh seventeen that hits

she says recycle reduce reuse and she

does oh I know he is 46 I think it did

to do there's sort of a bubbling hissing

sound as you plunge deep into this thing

and you can smell some horrible burning

see she gags then she does 13 damage

okay you actually do less damage than

that because this thing is damp and wet

and the fires don't really catch it very

well

it has resistance to fire might be

better that way yeah Buffy was eating

eight-foot tall pot pillar of fire

swinging his arms at us true enough well

she takes another swing okay that one is

a 11

that is a Miss she I think she's

probably like she tried super bowl swing

but just the dry heaves like yeah yeah

it's gross really really super stinky

gross and then it is DF Stern evil eye

can you sense it if this feel demonic or

or devilish do I need an action to do

that Chris uh that's your Divine sense

right yeah let me check I don't think I

I mean I think you might have to

yeah I think it's an action it's like a

contra P type thing divine sins blah as

an action oh okay

so they're so right that's fine sorry

I'll check later yeah

so after Evelyn has kind of swiped at it

D Ethel can take this moment to to kind

of sneak in there and knock basically

attack it while it's distracted by evil

ins heavy swing okay so DF will try to

pull out gutter I guess nothing really

knows like where it could potentially be

week mm-hmm it's fine because I really

wanted to do this are you automate it

right so this was said by a fan holy



I just got this today so I just wanted

to show it off a little bit into my

costume they did wish to be remain

anonymous okay but I just want to say

you know you are thank you for this this

is amazing and I love it so now des it's

also real spooky that's really cool is

the key fit oh yeah there you go so DF

pulls this out and then we'll try to

find a way to like kind of after all

distract kind of like plugging one

genitals mass yeah yeah alright how

about it just kind of like yep you do

get your sneak attack because it is

engaged in melee with your friends yeah

that with advantage er no that is if she

does engage I don't know if I were

nationally have advantage you would

actually okay cool that's much better

21 good good sneak attack success bomb

yep okay basically stabbing where he

would assume a living being would have

important organs and just trying to

whatever wherever that goopy masses he's

just hoping that

I'll stop terrible there's that 30 30

yeah okay yeah you plunge deep into this

thing it seems dude your your weapon

does tremendous damage to it sort of

tears through it and pierces through

something sort of spongy and soft and of

spurt of blood shoots out yeah oh it

please

interesting and then sort of kind of

half hanging out of its mass you see a

dirty grimy dead person oh whoops

wait what like a full like a corpse is

like a fresh corpse is inside this mass

but they were already dead right

unclear isin pool got her out and it's

coated in the blade of this man you're

like oh yeah if you want gutters

reaction gutters basically says he was

already dead yet good alright do better

next up is palton oh no corpses are

falling over in transition what a time

to be alive alright cool this thing's

all upon me so I'm gonna I'm gonna

thunder wave it okay make a constitution

saving through yes it's pretty good ex

alright it succeeds so it's a 20 on it's

con safe okay so it'll take half damage

mm-hmm

and I will take all of it resistance to

Thunder 16 ok that's already haft right

mm-hmm is that already oh no it was so

it'll be 8 ok

all right you blast it with thunderous

energy bits of trash fly off it or sort

of blown off it but the creature by and

large stays intact and the body is still

sort of flopping around in its mass it

is resilient we must learn through our

efforts convex I'm having trouble

staying in the accident study it very

much to sort of mindlessly flail away at

palton this times gonna hit you twice

and this will be the first attack does

another 13 the second attack does 17 for

a total of 30 points of damage

well cool and then it engulfs you in its

mass and you the rest of you just see

you just see pop Alton completely

engulfed in this creature and is now

incited with this dead corpse you hear

pop muffled like while you are engulfed

you are blinded and restrained and

unable to breathe neat and at this I

heard and when this creatures turn comes

around again will deal with any other

consequences as you feel the garbage

slowly crushing in around you

the next mule it is strictest okay well

I couldn't I couldn't do that do I feel

like if I would polymorph it if

everything in it would be polymorphed as

well including palton your polymorph

only effects a single creature so even

if it's a gulping something that would

only affect it okay I'm gonna try and

polymorph it then and that's a DC 16

saving throw wisdom save wisdom yeah

which I don't think pile of garbage is

that wise but you know I never know what

are you trying to polymorph it into um

we're in a theater so I guess I guess a

rat okay

yeah it's always we're in an X so I

guess accurate polymorph otherwise

doesn't make any sense

okay well she only does it because she's

worried about it if it stays that way

forever it needs to be able to survive

where it is not you're worried about

surviving you hear like paltin yell out

doorbell that would be Bo oh you see me

like a small part of it transform into a

dead rat and then just sort of flops out

but the rest of it is unaffected what

that's no great broom it's possible that

it had no effect and it just spit the

dead rat out okay and I'm going to jeez

I'm gonna try I'm gonna just you can

drop you need to drop a big bag of stuff

that's hanging by a rope on top of it if

you want to do Holdings in there yeah

that's true bring the set down huh I

guess I could do well I don't know if

infested I have infestation but I don't

know if that would work on it well I do

have control flames is it still on fire

no well nevermind I'm not gonna do

anything I'm just mean I'm just gonna

like throw some fats at it like I don't

know you add to the garbage kill it from

the inside balls that would be a sweet

place to thunder right evylyn mmhmm

paltin is now completely submerged in

this horrific stinky excrement monster

use like usually Ethan's reaction to

anything is go you know so you see her

like me and she just dives right into

the garbage to try to pull him out okay

make a contested strength check against

this creature come on

oh good luck okay yeah you reach in and

it's got such a tight grip on your

friend you have no ability to pull him

out at all that doesn't count as an

attack so I don't get a second one huh

that is your action so you're done cool

yep couldn't just have stuck in your

house garbage soap just her like

her lower body with her like fluttery

feet are sticking out and she's trying

to like graphic launch her legs onto

something that you can use to pull

herself back out you know I have two

friends stuck in this trash monster what

I'm considerably worse off than the

other when you say that like like an

orange rind sort of goes down your

throat well it's technically still

engaged with toys so I think as he kes

while palton people in is half sticking

out so I'm a pretty decent idea of where

their bodies are not correct so I would

like to stab them where they are not

okay do that and just maybe at some

point it'll like disperse or something I

don't know there's no advantage anymore

is there um I'm gonna say given the

present situation no okay thirteen Miss

yet like how it goes just a bit

hesitates cuz he's not doesn't want to

hit his friends she's more like just and

then he'll uh he'll use he's a cutting

action to disengage and kind of like

back up away from it a little bit so it

doesn't try to like swallow him up -

right

that you can do you can even find the

you know some set pieces to sort of

climb up on so you have a bit higher

ground and get a sort of sense of what

everything going on yeah sure I'll do

that alright it is Paul Tain's turn

paltin you are blinded and restrained

and unable to breathe but other than

that you know all school you know cool

great so it's not too bad

do I so so I have no idea that like

anyone tried to go you probably feel her

she grabbed on to you but was not able

to pull you out and it's probably still

grabbing onto you somewhere can I find

your way from in here yes you sure can

as long as you can do this without

talking because you can't breathe

pretty sure I can so thunder wave has no

verbal right or does it it has verbal oh

heck okay ah needs oh you know what I'll

still let you cast a verbal spell even

they can't breathe you can still exhale

Oh true okay just make your last

remaining breath well actually in but

you are restrained even though you're

restrained you still have some movement

of your limbs as well so that doesn't

restrict you from casting the spell

eater okay

would that also apply to Dimension Door

a dimension door you can basically cast

to a quote unquote blind location I

don't think you have to see the

destination so you could dimension door

out of this creature okay I'm gonna go

ahead and just GTFO out of here

yep as long as you can either visualize

it or you can just state the distance

and direction so you're gonna visualize

like before I was in here

okay share the story okay so not

terribly not terribly far away just

outside the creature okay dimension door

opens up near UDF and palton steps out

and he's just hammered just covered in

filth absolutely just black with filth

good okay okay and like a look at the

garbage I see ones like sick you know

it's like he's got like half of the

sliced up jellyfish stuck to the side of

his head jellyfish alright and that's

that's paltin which brings us to the top

and the creature which conveniently has

somebody half stuck in it anyway so you

know he's just gonna try to push you all

the way in evil in my mom she's like and

since you're already kind of stuck in it

I'm gonna say it has advantage so roll

the nineteen on its first attack and an

eighteen on its second so long well you

are basically stuffed into it you just

see her little Kiki feet disappear oh

you take a total of 28 points of damage

as you are stuffed inside and you are

now blinded restrained and unable to

breathe we had healed up since last time

yeah you were fully healed you said

twenty eight twenty eight and that's it

for it

Strix evylyn is now inside the creature

okay great damnit what how I can't I

don't do I know can I try an Arcana

check again any kind of way that I can

destroy this thing like sure absolutely

I just I want to know anyway you I'm

gonna give you advantage because you are

a collecting treasure man sir yay

shinobi Archon 24 so this creature is

sort of the construct equivalent the

trash construct equivalent of a

shambling mound okay unaligned basically

limited intellect creature it's got

enough smarts to kind of amble its way

around and find food that's about it

it's prob

you've seen it be resistant to fire it's

probably resistant to cold you think it

might be immune to lightning great as

well as being sort of naturally blind

it probably could only see out to a

certain range and then it's blind to be

on there it would have no means of

communication per se right although its

creator probably can directed in the

simplest possible way you think that it

has no particular immunity to magical

weapons or anything else

so aside from cold fire and lightning

you should be able to just below this

thing to pieces okay all right then I

guess I will do a quick and spell

fireball okay I can also do careful

spouts I haven't really abused me my

sorcery points I think okay great yep so

yeah we probably better to not burn the

theater down well that's well it is bro

[Laughter]

all right there's a big booth out in the

lobby or out by the entrance

the guards are kind of looking at each

other as this sound that goes out

towards there's outside words peaceful

in a year inside all years all right

okay bro your damage and this 35 okay

it failed its save so it takes because

it's got resistance to fire takes 17 it

little bits of it are on fire like it's

got papers and things stuck in it and

some of those are burning up but again

it's fire resistance means it doesn't

really catch fire all right but now all

this sort of billowing black acrid oily

smoke is coming off it from various

horrible things that have been rocking

inside of it and it's you can see

there's like as it sort of shambles

around and changes its shape like rusty

knives kind of stick out of it at a time

other things other discarded wares and

it is still alive and kick'n even after

that fireball there are set pieces that

have caught fire but that's because

they're basically made of light dry

woods

and then it is Evelyn's turn

evylyn what do you do well well that's a

great question Chris Perkins I think

that I want to just try to swim out of

the garbage okay

make a strength athletics check versus

its strength athletic string I'm just

rolling like hoop that so is thirteen

ironic yeah you do not get out cool cold

sick this is Evelyn's literal nightmare

yeah trying to think let's see what else

you can do

you're basically just trying to break

out of its grapple on you I can't

remember if that's a move action or and

act like a move or an action I'm just

checking it up right now

[Music]

there it is it is an action so you have

used your action I have another idea but

I feel like even probably was probably

not thinking super strategically right

now Morris trying to like yeah you were

so clean this morning yeah so I'm on

this piece of set yes and palta just

appeared next to me yes des will turn

tough paltin and just be like table did

you see anything in here in there

anything vulnerable I didn't I didn't

see all that much man yeah he was

totally tied in there

I saw darkness I smelled bad and it's

horrible and we need to get her happy

well damnit idea thil then leap from the

set piece and come on down it's probably

like

wedding altar that you're standing on so

yeah you look just like a small D from

that just try to bring it down into it

all right

safely away from wherever he balloon is

can you tell where I am uh I'm gonna say

yeah cuz I rolled in natural 20 all

right excellent

hooray so this is all a lot of G sixes

okay Brown there's gonna take a lot of

math so give me one second sure

twenty-nine plus my good lord

okay what'd I say you were the first

number 109 oh okay uh total of 53 holy

Hey look I just bring it down like I'm

top of the head and just carve it all

the way down yeah you just sort of tear

it open like a cheap suit and I'm sort

of a goner does the equivalent uh yeah

this is all bad the dead corpse that it

encapsulated earlier sort of flops out

the two halves of it just sort of split

and crashed down on to the stage freeing

evil in the monster is dead all right

don't like the like peels apart trash

falls on D yeah it's doing it Tuesday

afterwards just kind of standing there

like there's like just this perfect

little banana peel on evil in his head

okay it's it's pieces sort of drape down

over all sides of her head and so the

monster goes like and like that wasn't

even like them yoke of the little egg

drip drip yes Trix is gonna immediately

fly down and prestidigitator one so no

one's dirty right like she does that and

even goes Thanks and then she does it

again but like she doesn't do it to

herself and she just starts rooting

through the garbage she's still filled

it's very clear that this creature at

one point must have scooped up like a

homeless person and that's who you found

in those corpses

okay so wasn't so yeah so after that

death will kind of like step on a mouse

just kind of step away from it right and

you get big digitated yeah all right

before we go strikes out examine this

corpse find out what the hell made this

thing I'll do my best

you start picking through yeah through

it as long as everyone's clean paltin

also needs cleaned okay you take care of

everybody yeah except for myself doesn't

resolve

yeah then tries to put up any small

fires around okay yeah yeah there's like

a drape that's caught fire that you're

basically stamping out start stamping

out like a strong costume like a little

too hard yeah so she'll start trying to

figure out what the thing is

all right um as you're picking through

the garbage and you're trying to get a

sense of where it came from

you think that most of the stuff it is a

mast would have accumulated in the doc

ward okay so there's like fish skeletons

and no God it smells even worse yeah

it's it's it's all pretty foul a lot of

a lot of discarded waste that filters

down through the dark doc word you see

evidence of that here you can also see

some bit bits of half-burnt or not on

broad sheets of the sort of sort more

sorted kind that you find distributed

around the doc ward make an insight

check wisdom that is a 1617 that's good

enough so as you're looking through the

garbage a few of the broadsheets strike

you as curious because they all appear

to be copies of the same broad sheet and

it is a broad sheet that is no longer

circulated and hasn't been circulated

around water deep for years oh and it's

called it's called the little birdie a

little birdie which is why it sort of

strikes you as

familiar because you probably would have

read it back in the day oh it's a it's a

cheap gossip rag that was sort of common

for a while but it was quickly driven

out of business

so when Strix was in water deep she

would have seen this yes she would have

seen she probably would have lined her

nest as it were with little birdie

broadsheets so she'll pick one up in and

show it to DF and be like do you

remember this beautiful take the paper

and look at it I'll imagine he meant

remember is it - yeah it even though

it's sort of covered in grime and

whatnot there is a it you can tell it's

aged that before it was sort of engulfed

in this creature the other thing you

notice you make a perception check DF

sure there are arcane symbols on the

back that Strix didn't see Oh

DL be like okay she's like no and what

does it say when you look at the arcane

symbols Strix you believe that these

particular pieces of parchment are

basically the source of its animating

power oh that somebody put put these

arcane marks on these pieces of paper

stuff them into with some other garbage

to basically animate the creature is

using old broad sheets to animate

garbage how many pieces of these

parchment are in here it's hard to tell

some of them got burnt up in fires and

whatnot but you can see that there's

like twelve or thirteen of them that you

can sell OSH okay yeah much as possible

motivation to do this yeah will collect

as many as we can yeah yeah and you can

see that they're all the same broad

sheet like the same issue of the same

broad sheet yeah it's not different

issues distributed on different weeks or

different months it's just what is that

what is the on in the issue what is it

talking about you can see it's talking

about all sorts of gossip about ship

captains getting it on

and doing illicit trades and that kind

of thing it's all kind of sorted trashy

right gossip mongering but you can see

at the top of the sheet underneath the

banner is the little birdies publishing

address perfect strikes turns it around

points in 2d and did you see this you

turn it back around and just says know

exactly what we needed good works tricks

thanks good work you two a good work

evil and impulse and where'd you go

probably the structure offers back now I

need this it might be hard getting it

past all the guards maybe it's a gift

they want to give us an exchange for

saving their theater I'll persuade them

I'll be fine ok make a persuasion check

against the ghost of Malcolm here we go

spikes is like here I'll take care of it

and she just animates the chair ok all

right I like walk faster guys like

excuse me sir

all right that's pretty freaky

just like they make a persuasion check

with advantage pulp in because on the

one hand they're probably not gonna give

you grief because the chair is actually

walking around ok wow I just rolled to

18s in a row so 26 one of the guys like

I didn't realize stairs could do that

exactly yeah I am known throughout this

land potential I'm like the top guest at

Shere Khan

do this keynote mm-hmm so I'm just gonna

I'm just gonna be taking this back to uh

to further by all right they do take the

papers and fines Barnabas and safe okay

they're they're waiting outside

yeah and find them and just be like well

it's safe we took care of its will need

to be done and if the dung sweepers were

doing their job there'd be less of these

as well and they'll take some of the

papers and be like and these were inside

of it I don't know if you recognize

these but these are extremely outdated

nobody reads anymore I've never read

them but more importantly they come from

true here oh yes you point out the

address and Sergeant Romney says oh this

is all well done yes solid good so then

he says I'm familiar with that place

there's an old run-down edifice on fish

got pork yeah

you go take care of that for you to the

bottom it says well I wouldn't mind if

you checked it out but you don't have to

deal with the problem we can deal with

it ourselves we have plenty of sitting

Watchmen who can assist but maybe a

little reconnaissance would be an order

find out what we're up against what

right if you could handle taking care of

it you could handle reconnaissance too

right of course yes

you've done plenty good yeah I don't

want to press you any further good so

we're all squared away then there's no

other you're not worried about strix is

unregistered abilities I'm registered

don't even though I'm a sorcerer you do

know you are

Lancel these fine gentlemen in the magic

chance to come but that expands easily

enough I didn't think Bart don't barns

have to register she points at Paulson

where they could it's optional of course

optional my favorite option there well

you may want to do that before your

final up toward the world really they

already just

well it means their music and laughter

more than their spells mm-hmm well the

last time we tried to be quiet and do

reconnaissance we blew up a mountain so

let's not do that

no worries we'll take care of it

jolly good work good yeah you're welcome

and again we will keep take care in the

manor doing our own thing and you don't

have anything to fear from us for you if

you're interested we'll keep you posted

on what we find

yeah I wouldn't know in fact do you that

dance there seems to be a contested at

rational man sir before that little joke

safe have a good nap I see what you did

there that was really good

of course there's no such thing as a

trash a man sir I just made that up

that's yep mm-hmm I've done thank you I

think the alcohol is wearing off no way

well then only one solution to the bar

[Laughter]

I'll just return back safely then and

again if you learn anything else please

please let us know this for our own sake

let's go check it out get back to you

and then there's nothing else is it okay

if I still go through people's garbage

if you if only if they have truly

discarded and if they use for it then of

course it's city property and I don't

think the dung sweepers online if you

have some of it up Oh certainly she'll

just be cleaning it up right Streisand

then perhaps maybe looking for it

anything is a consequence though know

where to find it right that's right

cleaning I'm looking for clues that's me

that's me but maybe you should tell her

not to bring any more trash into the

house cuz that's probably against the

room even I'm hurt I give you that some

of that trash in their presents I think

your friend in the chairs making a scene

we'll keep in touch

alright and you part company with

Inspector Bob tries to wrangle the crew

and get them back to their manner as

paltin enjoys his one-man quarry

I mean I'm still walking with just in

right a chair very sort of Columbus Lee

and slowly but you do make it back to

your residence and now you have a Strada

chair it is most impressed by seeing it

go upstairs yeah actually you can you

own a corner of the bar and just park

[Music]

close access to the wine bus all right

to the bar yes and it is one of those

poultices chair only none of us are

allowed to sit absolutely okay yeah and

actually you probably have to get Strix

to press the digit a some of the crap

and garbage that got on the chair just

to clean that up it's no longer animated

and she's like I'm not gonna do that

again it's okay I can do it too

[Laughter]

all right um tell me about your evening

routines sure

for the record deaath kept some of those

broadsheets mm-hmm

just so that he has information evening

routine after after we all eat basically

when you're getting ready to retire for

the night and call it a day

what do you do as you prepare to go to

bed if there's time strikes will

probably make dinner let's let's let's

assume that yeah the the dinner stuff is

over with you've wrapped up your your

business for the day and you're getting

ready to go to bed how do each of you

prepare for the night's slumber starting

with the df' so first thing he does is

return to his Attica quarters and Undong

all of his equipment so basically he

takes off everything you say for like

boots pants and his uh deep blue tunic

and from there he either goes up to the

either the turret peak or from the attic

window or wherever it is make his way to

as high up as possible or onto the roof

tops either way and just takes a moment

to reflect upon himself and the day

while looking at the Nights

I okay who's next I want to try and hide

one of dad's keys damn it strikes is

getting for bed ready for bed in the

same room with this stuff does she shoo

you out like that probably I mean I'm

most likely invisible well that's true

see this Keys floating away be like no

no no sometimes she might on this

particularly night an argument well not

really an argument one-sided discussion

between Strix and Simon provides the

optimal distraction for Paulsen to sink

in and and hockey once you've hidden the

key somewhere where you know DF will

find it eventually what do you do to

prepare for the rest of the night if

anything like you just you throw all

your clothes off onto the floor do you

just sort of pack everything away neatly

do you I I get I sit in the chair right

of course

and then I animate it I'm like to bed

alright you come up into your room the

chair dumps you into your bed just like

good night Simon sleep in the turret

like that the Amazon little room yeah he

sort of crawls up into the turret and

kind of disappears up there he sort of

claimed the turret as his home

evylyn after dinner wraps up you take

sort of a plate of food out two waffles

in the den and make sure that she gets

well-fed as usual mm-hmm then you

probably have playtime and wrestle time

with her tumbling around she's gonna say

like some tug of war yeah tug of war

pulling up stuff yeah yeah and actually

it ends up that even like cuz I think

even could be easily pulled over by

waffles so she uses her flying boots as

like resistance and she's like

so yeah I think they play for a while

yeah I think that even is from spending

so much time as a construct she's not

used to how much sleep she needs as a

human so I think she has a bad habit of

like hanging out at the bar or wherever

everyone is like way too late and she

gets up so early but she'll still kind

of like be like like drifting off as

she's but she's like yeah yeah I'm like

you know and she'll so she has a

tendency to do that but when she does

actually put herself to bed and go

through like her actual nighttime

rituals she takes a bath and reads

because she's actually fairly studious

she has all these like holy texts and

things which kind of pours over them

does the nightly devotional thing

fastidiously cleans her armor and

weapons and sets them she has I imagine

she has like a man like a stand yeah and

she puts them all they're like all

perfect if she needs her clothes clean

she asks tricks to prestidigitator

before she sets them out like all nice

and starched and then she tucks herself

in bed pulls up the covers and goodnight

Lysander goes to sleep strix so strict

so late until everyone is asleep and

then she'll go around and make sure that

all the doors are locked everything is

safe all the windows are locked

you see after everybody's gone to sleep

you do hear some creaking up the stairs

and it's just Simon going up the stairs

with a glass of milk so and it's I guess

like eventually instead of putting

warding circles around everyone she'll

just ward with chalk around each window

okay she can I'm adored and then she'll

just do that little tiny symbols cuz

evil and got mad at her when they're

really big and then she'll check her

potions in the basement make sure all of

those are doing well okay and I guess

sometimes deaath would be asleep

sometimes he probably might not be

asleep you might be in the turret but

she'll just hide her stuff under the

board I'd all her things and then uh

turn her staff into the owl bear and a

little stuff down there

chill this she'll just like sit there

for a second us holding the owl bear

maybe crying possibly crying depends on

the day crazy awesome the day yeah and

then she'll just like curl up as tight

as you can do a ball in the corner and

just like fall asleep crying or maybe

not crying depends on the day okay Strix

you do have a dream that night now it's

it's actually just a kind of a flashback

dream to when you were living in water

deep kind of in the streets and now that

you're in this house and surrounded by

friends people that you can trust and

you've kind of got this safe sanctuary

that's completely alien and unfamiliar

to your life experience this dream sort

of strikes you as weirdly nostalgic but

kind of out of place in your present day

mindset you're digging around through

trash and you've done many times before

in a pile in an alley I guess you have

trash on the mind and you're startled

and jumped by a creature that is

basically a bird man a can COO oh and as

he attacks you and tries to steal your

trash you hellish rebuke him burn the

feathers off his head and sent him

screaming down the alley

oh he attacked me but that's really sad

yep and as you in your dream as you

scamper off and lace your nest with your

find on probably on a rooftop somewhere

lodged up by a chimney where you can

stay warm you realize that some of the

garbage that you took that he dropped

our little birdie pamphlets oh no this

poor little bird something I must have

done something to him I like wake up in

the middle of your probably awake DF

because starts awakening me like leaps

on the bed like like three-point stance

ready to and the rest of you in the

house probably like well the palton

would hear because it's on the floor

above evil and wooden because she's on

the far side of the house

and I think she sleeps like the dead

yeah probably so paulten you hear the

cry of sad bird about like one of one of

Strix as many night terrors you see

these as you says you sit up in the

night paltin you see Simon come out of

his little door and he's got an empty

glass sort of lined with a little bit of

milk and then he just sort of disappears

down in the kitchen thinking you're

still asleep

what is he doing with it this little

glass and that's where we'll stop okay

so the secret so yeah no kidding

next week since we have the big

crossover game with acquisitions Inc not

this coming weekend with the following

weekend for next week before we get to
