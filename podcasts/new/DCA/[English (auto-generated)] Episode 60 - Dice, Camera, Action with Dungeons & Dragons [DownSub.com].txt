welcome to the season two finale of

diced camera action everyone when last

we left the waffle crew they were

stranded in snow until an airship

swooped down and saved them an airship

crewed by a half-elf with draconic

heritage named Sam dalla who had a pet

pseudo dragon named summer wise who

likes apples after being picked up it

was revealed by son della that she is on

a secret mission in exchange for

delivering the waffle crew to where they

needed to go they would help her

complete it because she doesn't feel

which is made up of six black costumed

figures kind of sinister types

yeah they're pretty weird she took you

north up into the glaciers past the

spine of the world mountains where there

is a frost giant village called Crone

and I'm deep inside a glacial rift and

as the ship descended you noticed that

there were a bunch of slaughtered dragon

or so a bunch of slaughtered frost

giants and it was clear upon inspection

that they were killed by a dragon or

dragons making her way into one of the

frozen gigantic frost giant lodges you

noticed hanging up among the rafters a

gigantic Alpine horn which evylyn blue

it's worth also mentioning that you have

both these dragon cultists and captains

and ala with you and that as you were

making your way into the lodge you saw

footprints from some human or humanoid

figure who had preceded you anyway

this big giant horn was irresistible to

evilly that's a way to put it

although although everything seemed

pretty dead around here that got the

attention and earned the ire of a

gigantic frost giant who comes out

through a curtain at the back of the

lodge and you see that this frost giant

not only is immense

but has three frost giant heads on its

shoulders the central head has a Bighorn

helm with icicles clinging to parts of

it

the other two heads also have battered

Helms without the Bighorns and they're

all glaring at you and you can see it

draws forth a gigantic great axe I'd

like everyone to roll initiative I know

exactly what happens Susie starts any

sentence with I'd like everyone to yeah

I'm sorry

640 Blin five five four strings Wow okay

twenty-three okay oh thank god it was

someone smart

[Laughter]

okay so Donny Jean dalla will act first

and then her crew will act immediately

after her but first dia you are by far

the most ready for trouble all right you

were ready ever since you saw evylyn put

her lips on the I could still recognize

a mistake as it happened yeah so I've

already seen this thing ik he's already

come out of a curtain and yes yield

himself and I see him there yes and

based on what you see you think this he

might actually be a she okay all right

so then I guess has she taken full

notice of all of us she and she and she

all looked down the lodge at the group

silhouetted in the doorway and so it

seems to be focused more on you

and paltin and Jean dalla and her crew

and not on Strix and evylyn who were

flying up near the ceiling paltin just

gives like a except it's hard to not be

seen by three pairs of eyes okay so yeah

evylyn and Strix flew up how difficult

would it for me to climb up there make

myself get myself up to that height

first above her it's not impossible

there's ice on the pillars that support

the ceiling which makes climbing a

little bit challenging you think you

would have disadvantage on your

athletics check all right great okay so

okay so first thing I'll do then is a

media kind of like look back to everyone

else and just tell everyone to to stay

slip as much as possible and try to

surround her because I assume she's

going to be hostile at it at us and then

uh the idea we'll just kind of run off

to the side and take defensive position

behind a pillar or something in case she

tries to throw something or something

like that she looks like run off and

take position there and wait for her to

act move in so that you can yeah there

are a lot of dark shadowy places in here

so you have no guide while going off and

going somewhere where you don't think

you can be easily seen all right even by

three sets of eyes straight right

logistics question are we is is she so

tall that she could reach us no matter

where we are in this cavern or could we

go high enough that she couldn't reach

us the ceiling of the lodge is more

about its peak is almost twice if not

more her height so you think if you went

up high enough like above the horn she

would not be able to strike you at least

not with her axe okay okay

zom dalla you and your crew are standing

in the doorway you see that dart you've

that humongous figure at the far end of

the hall I think sandala first off

instinctually mom arms everyone nobody

move

and then I think I'd like to cast fly on

my cell

okay and spell and move up to I believe

it's 60 feet

I wanna I'd like to hover up to there I

level up to the Giants I level the

Giants I level where I'm at at the big

get the the front of the room hopefully

no nearer to her and I haven't but just

a little distance but just levitating

straight upward got it mm-hmm

so you're better I got 30 feet off the

floor okay and I'd like to say hey mam's

we've got some questions for you if

you're down to talk I want to feel out

that option before we go any further

what are your thoughts here ma'am all

right you get an incomprehensible

response from all three heads what

languages do you understand I understand

call me Maria Connick dwarvish elvish

and halfling of which this language is

none good is it celestial so nobody here

speaks giant make an insight check a

wisdom insight check for you since you

have the insight skill plus six plus six

so there would be a seven Wow you had no

insights your crew whose last orders

were to basically just stay where you

are and don't do anything will draw

their weapons they draw their weird sort

of curved bladed swords but they don't

advance okay

it seems mostly a defensive maneuver

okay

and at that point the giant stomps past

the big Frozen Throne half buried in

skulls at the back of the hall and

runs rate for the crew and paltin bout

stick it is worth noting that because

the hall is 120 feet long

she is only able to cross 80 feet so now

she is 40 feet away from you paltin and

crew and as a evylyn stern she's very

disturbed by the neighbors today so to

make sure she's not barking all right I

I yell wah wah wah hold on let's not be

hasty and I try to do nature's wrath on

those binds around her feet all right

save our Constitution save it's my and I

keep getting muted all right

so sorry I think I actually it's a

strength or dexterity save its choice so

it's not there's no strength because I

shouldn't have done that

roll day 25 so yeah isn't even slowed

down a whit as vines erupted from the

icy floor of the lodge and tried to

grasp at her abs cool Ruta all right and

one of the heads one of the heads as

it's running down the hall will actually

look up at you the spell can I talk to

the free action no all right please

don't taunted it's really big I wanted

to come after me instead of them I can

fly

halten what would you like to do okay so

this this thing yes lovely lady his uh

his firm is charging at me

okay cool that's scary as all hell who

is though within a 10 feet of me 10 feet

of you would be will say the crew of the

airship the same Carrick's dark clad

crew members and no no party nearby no

party they have all abandoned you

oh well that's not had an earlier

initiative it took strategic positions

this is I'm talking in terms of politics

all right so I I'm just like oh god

everyone's gone this thing's heavy and I

panic and I just I'm just gonna cast the

hut all right do you want it to be

transparent or dark and I still see out

this is dark please okay oh my god i

watch this happening I'm just gonna say

I'm so hard like Oh No all right miss

Roth will turn to you is the dome erupts

around him and his fellows and just sort

of nods approvingly I look back I'm like

still on trust you okay yeah so up to

nine creatures can fit inside the dome

so you can get them all and DFU are

outside the dome at the moment right and

creatures and objects within the dome

when you cast the spell can move through

it freely all other creatures are barred

from passing through it all right when

the dome springs up the giant kind of

slides across the icy floor a second

surprised by this magical ledger domain

and sort of blinks and glares at this

dome and not quite sure what the heck it

is and what it does all right and

Drix what do you do as the dome erupts

around paltin and completely enshrouding

I would like to cast darkness on the

giant's heads okay

like to blind write this thing I want to

check the darkness smell to see if it's

centered on a point or gonna cruise I

think it is a point it's just a point of

space okay a 15-foot sphere you choose

yeah so it's basically locked in space

but yes when you create this big dome of

utter blackness and you kind of Center

it on the giant the whole her whole

upper body is basically enveloped in it

great can I also yell at her while

that's happening oh yeah absolutely

when I do that and see the dome I'm just

gonna be like we can cover your whole

body and evil darkness if you don't stop

attacking us what language you saying

this in all right well she is she is

starting to howl but it's more of an

angry howl in a frightened one when the

darkness envelops her it's not a like

would you talk like that that's fine all

right

d/f yes what would you like to do I said

now that she's clearly like enveloped in

darkness and can't see anything from my

position I'm going to cunning action -

and just Sprint's so that I run past her

back legs and as I'm running forward I

pull out gutter and as I'm going across

it I basically kind of like leap up and

do a splash across the back of her foot

or ankle or leg whatever is I can reach

the slash land and they continue running

forward and then like hiding on the

opposite side okay you think guys yeah

all right so we can attack Roy you have

advantage on the attack and if you hit

you get your sneak attack

[Laughter]

real good twenty-eight all right yes you

absolutely cut into her flesh

I think my d6 is hold on all right all

right cool it's literally like all the

d6 is I freaking own is already here oh

there's no one's there's no twos either

this is awesome

this is not waffle crew are you sure

[Laughter]

it's a Christmas miracle oh my gosh okay

that's a crippling wound from DF as

blood spatters onto the icy floor and he

continues to run past leaping to the

other side and losing himself among the

pillars and once again you hear terrible

Howl's coming from the mouths of this

creature and sandala you are suspended

30 feet up in the air in front of this

giant at its eye level but you can't of

course see it because there's a big

sphere of Darkness around it except for

its legs sticking out the bottom okay

quick question is this a creature or a

humanoid this is not a humanoid but it's

a creature thank you I I think I would

like to cast ice storm okay make a

actually I'm not gonna even have you

make a check you don't believe you think

the ice storm will have a diminished

effect on her because frost giants are

immune to cold

it shall still take some damage from the

hailstones the bludgeoning damage but

she won't take any of the cold damage

from the spell okay I think I can do

let's try a Strix thing and do some

fireball alright can I use my fifth

level spell for that you sure can

so I will do 10 d6 damage oh I gotta

make a saving throw

okay Strix easy did the fireball and

she's just like the giant needs to roll

a 15 to succeeding us your spell I

rolled a 15 on the die but it's

dexterity is minus one so it fails Oh No

okay I have half of it rolled hang on

okay I count on my fingers I'm sure

everyone in Chadha seen me do that you

guys this is good hang on it's gonna

take me a second to mask this carry the

fire

there's so many numbers this is good

though hang on and a huge plume of fly

it fire wraps around the creature

shrieks and the smell of burnt fur fill

the air 42 points of damage

okay two facts just at 80 points of

damage to this creature will be done

that destroyed that's fine all right you

feel you feel a little bit of sort of

heat blowback from the spell hits you

it's kind of comforting because it's

really really bitter cold in here show

you up like that so mad okay the crew of

the ship will stay in the dome for now

watch their captain like this creature

up and palton just make a perception

check for me sure brainwash you 17 all

right as you're standing there you just

noticed that the corner of your eye that

these dragon cultists are having what is

basically a silent conversation behind

you and one of them is kind of like

making like gestures and the other ones

just like what are y'all talking about

back there they just repeat they just

sort of stopped doing what they're doing

and just kind of point to the giant like

that's what they were talking about can

I do a quick persuasion be like are you

sure oh you see here

that'd be in nineteen and one of them

just says we weren't talking about you

[Laughter]

alright and then of you one of the other

one says we like you it's like oh I have

an assistant opinion on alright next up

is the giant and let's see just got

ankle slash just got blown up is going

to continue to stride forward because

that's the direction she knows enemies

are located and as she emerges from the

edge of the darkness the first thing she

sees is use on Billa and she will swing

at you with her weapon and as she does

you notice cuz you're up really close to

her now but about ten feet away that

that those fiery wounds that she has are

starting to heal she is a regenerating

creature bragging to fight come on

generate over fire and she's going to

enter a rage and as she enters this rage

saliva begins to spit from her three

mouths and she brings her weapon upon

you with tremendous force she rolls a 28

on her first attack and nice nice P 12

okay remember how we didn't kill the

guess she does 28 points of damage to

you some dollar with our great acts and

then she bring it around again and

attempt to hit you again this time

rolling at 24 and does another 28 points

of damage beautified so you've taken 56

points no damage

sideout that's almost all my head points

yeah so you can see the hell's blood

gets splashed everywhere

is it like splatter on the walls of the

hut

yes yeah it sort of drips down the domed

outer surface of the hut pouring down

off it yeah that's bad that's bad and

paltin you don't have to make a check to

know that these guys you're with don't

seem too heartbroken I like call out

really quick you doing it okay all right

all right I believe in you people in

Europe the giant s is no longer blind

correct correct I am going to cast

blinding smite and I am going to well

hopefully I'm going to because I'm gonna

try to hit her with tree bein right and

upon hitting her if I managed to I will

great so you swoop down and whack on her

with tree beam 15 15 hits yay oh wow

turns out not hard to hit that's amazing

okay so um I yell something like the

line of levander flows through me and

welcomes you into light in the next life

and then I swing my vein and I hit with

let's see 10 points of normal damage

okay but then I get an extra 3d8

radiant damage 18 radian 28 total and

then she needs to succeed on a

constitution saving throw or she's

blinded yes because she has extra heads

she has advantage on this saving throw

which is good because she ruled a 1 and

a 17 so she is not blind

one of her heads goes blind and you see

cataracts just sort of form over her

eyes magical cataracts the other two

heads however can see clearly well can I

take my second attack and try to hit one

of the other heads well yeah absolutely

but you can't use more than one bonus

section around so you can't use the

spell again right but I can maintain

concentration on the cell while

attacking yes absolutely

good so this time I roll a 16 okay

that's it

and we just 11 points of damage all

right and again she has to make a saving

throw

she has advantage and she's going to

make it she failed one of them so I'm

gonna say her a second head goes blind

so she's down to one not blind head

right now nice nice so my blinding smite

stays on the weapon for the duration

while you concentrate and nice when you

hit our weight let me double-check that

hang on I was thinking that it was just

a no no it's just the next time you

strike a creature with a man time so it

only it happens once once it goes off

it's done so that was just normal

so one head is blinded okay all right I

did try to hit one of the unblinded

heads though okay you clock it on the

head you stick your X in its skull pull

it out blood seeps out nice all right

and palton inside the safety of your

heart yeah blood dripping down on top of

the hut what do you do uh so how far is

she she's about ten feet away cool I'm

gonna dissonant whispers I'm just feel

like I'm gonna stay in here but still

help because I want to contribute but I

also you know do that

spells and other magical effects can't

extend through the dome or be cast

through it

of course I do which is why oh that's

right that won't work okay

I'm going to reassess the situation and

one thing you do know I don't know if it

would help her in any way but your

Bartok inspiration is technically just

an ability it's not really a spell so

that would that would you that would

work beyond the dome just so you know oh

that's good to know

you think in the universal language

policy cool um so let's see site so yeah

who's going do I do I know who's going

after me yes you do that would be Strix

okay I'm gonna and around on a broom

can i play Strix a nice little song sure

cool I'm gonna do that yeah if you make

a d20 role you can add your inspiration

die which is a d12 from paul sweet

alright and Strix what do you want to do

alright well I don't want to waste this

lovely song that I just got so even

though I'm real mad I want to cast

fireball super bad so I'm just gonna you

know I don't I don't need brute force

that's a d20 plus what was it d12 but

you're polymorphic yes okay I don't need

a ruler also wisdom savvy girl for

anything that's right yeah that's right

uh so you're like I don't need Bartok

inspiration she says that in one of my

strings just

[Laughter]

okay so what's your safety scene all

right the giant rolled a 14 so and as

far as I can tell has no special

resistances to this so what are you

trying to what do you what are you

probably offering her into so many

options

it's my staple to just go for a chicken

because they're so and not the silkie

like the last chicken this would be a

three-headed phantom chicken so just

your classic closer classic chicken with

three heads I'm learning a lot about

things bye alright so where's

three-headed battle chicken appears

really really small heads is blind so

it's just kind of looking around in

wrong direction

let's be like I know magic all right so

cool and death yes so what are you gonna

do now that the threat has been

neutralized at least for a moment now

what we landed here

was there a deep chasm of sorts or like

so you landed basically at the bottom of

a chasm in a way this whole village kind

of lies at the bottom of a Great Rift

with with sort of chasm like passages

leading out of it there isn't a deeper

pit beyond that that we couldn't see the

bottom of or anything not that you could

see now there just doesn't happen to be

a nice place to push this job um yeah

there's no cliff to throw it off of

make a intelligence check yeah okay I'll

do that

six you don't see any cliffs but you do

kind of hear some creaking noises and

kind of hanging from off the pillars you

see what appeared to be some old cages

and nets and other things which you

assume the Giants use for trapping and

whatnot

it might not be useful I mean they're

pretty thickly made if you were to put

the chicken in one of them and it were

to at some time revert to its normal

form you think it might be at least

mildly uncomfortable as a you know

suddenly increased in size within that

cramped little space yeah I'd rather it

put it somewhere so small that for

suddenly on polymorph his entire body

would not be able to fit into it and

it'd just be stick wished I mean I guess

I'll just I'll go I'll be just golly go

and I'll pick up that three-headed

flying chicken okay you've got the

chicken by the neck or under the arm or

whatever its neck

you got this fat chicken under your arm

and then rappeling it you do kinda have

to chase it around for about ten seconds

but yes you are definitely faster than

this right and then I'll just ask

everyone else like you wouldn't know a

good place to put a chick polymorph

chicken there's a there's a cage up I

can fly the chicken just stick them in

up in the rafters all right okay so BF

while you're waiting first strikes to

swoop down and take the chicken from you

not something i DM gets to say a lot all

of you see coming out from the back of

the hall basically the same direction

that the giant came from is

something you never thought you'd see

which is a what looks like a giant bird

made early of ice and riding on the bird

is what looks to be a human figure in

sort of a winter parka cool and it is

just it just hauls ass

let me check how fast it goes it's like

a nice Phoenix it's like a nice Phoenix

that's neat actually it's more of a nice

it's a little bit more like an an ice

adventure oh we need to get a new bird

that one looks nice are you suggesting

stealing things that person might be

evil we might have to confiscate it so

nice link to it I'm just like I want

that yeah

this giant this giant ice vulture flies

the length of the hall so it actually

actually moves doing nothing else it

moves 120 feet so it crosses the entire

hall passes right over your head sandela

and is now but 10 feet behind you in the

doorway leading outside and as the rider

glides past he just sort of looks around

takes stock of as many of you as

possible and then focuses on what lies

ahead

I would like now Jean dalla since it's

your turn you may act if you wish you

recognize this individual I know I do

I'm pretty sure this is artist yes

and if he's riding this creature he has

the ring he has the ring by the way guys

I can't talk to them can i when I'm in

the air right here you can you can are

too okay well I scream to everyone

that's artists he has the ring the bird

is a ring thing he's got it we can't

hold you we gotta get that ring

it looks like ability of the situation

has just done the poppy it looks like

the dragon cultists would agree with you

I've never seen Paulson so far but using

saying that songul that does not use

your action so you still have and you

can still move if you wish I would like

to you're also pretty you're also

bleeding profusely can I miss you step

into the hut or is that not alive you

that's a very good question because

technically the spell isn't passing

through the hut you are right I'm

teleporting to a place where I can

actually you can't because you were not

only hot when the spell is cast so you

are you are hedged out if you try my bad

is there any way I can communicate with

my crew who are in the height sounds

real ormally okay I'd like to miss you

step two like the entrance of the hut

earth there's no entrance is just a dark

dark colored dome in fact it's cut you

can't even see through it at the moment

okay I'll miss you step to the hut yep

and scream into it why the aren't

you guys okay

at which point they will run out of the

hut after the figure on the giant ice

bunker and what they do is they leap up

into the air impossibly high for people

that don't have wings but you see they

have these sort of black cut capes and

they throw themselves up into the air

and as they do they hack at the ice bird

to try to take it down and and it's that

I need that the birds fake you guys you

can get anyone all right it up

alright all six of them are able to leap

up and some of them sort of parkour off

of this the doorway and other spring

laterally as they slash

at this ice bird with their blades and

as they hack at it you see chips of the

bird why often cracks form in its form

and it actually takes all six of them

but as the last one cuts through the

bird explodes into shards of ice and the

rider goes tumbling outside and kind of

half down the giant steps in front of

the launch with sort of a bone-crunching

thud and then all of these dragon

cultists are land like birds on the

ground again as the shower of ice just

sort of falls around them and that's the

end of their turn it is evil UNS turned

i actually a good thing before I do that

oh how long does it last

it lasts an hour at last an hour we have

fun1 our concentration yeah okay great

actually says up to one hour

evylyn yes so now the hooded figure is

on the floor on the ground outside the

lodge on the steps outside all right

well I was gonna say I fly but I run

just as fast as I fly so I do a really

cool combo like your superhero like

flying until I hit the ground and then

hit the ground running you think it will

take you a double move to get to him I

will do that

okay you get to him and as he sort of

kind of lying there kind of rolling over

onto a side after a very hard fall you

can see underneath the parka that he is

a you'd say a middle-aged but athletic

man

good-looking trimmed mustache and beard

kind of long brown silky hair to his

shoulders

underneath the parka you can see he

seems to be wearing a leather armor and

he's got gloves on so you can't see the

ring stay down in the name of Lysander

all right he does not respond right away

but he does kind of look at you because

he's not exactly sure what he's looking

at it first some sort of otamatone are

talking about

Lysander the morning Lord all right I

don't have if I double moved I don't

have an action that's correct

he just Kirara all right paulten you're

up okay I'm gonna so how far how far is

this dude he is about from where you are

currently about 20 feet outside the door

so about 20 feet away from you

cool so I'm gonna go to him feel like I

need that okay you sort of push past the

dragon cultist yes I need a big giant

steps and you can get to him with your

movement that's no problem when you get

to him what do you try to do if anything

I'm going to so I I like no he has the

ring cuz of that right yes okay cool I'm

going to persuade him

[Laughter]

and you're going to do that by just

saying like like hey like you seem like

a man who needs little to no burden I

can relieve that breath oh you may

relieve that burden on to me he says he

says to you the ring will control one

who is weak of mind cool

it is evil

yeah I've had experience with that so

I'll probably be alright ice please

since he just knows you he hasn't met

you he's reluctant to give you the ring

I still get a persuasion role No are you

drunk also just question for absolutely

so threw it through the through the al

fumes he he says no and then I turn to

my party I'm just like I tried

everything I could

now that because you couldn't make a

role I did let you make a role you still

technically have your action you've only

talked so you haven't taken an action

yet I'm going to go out you do have

spells that allow you do that basically

what you're trying to do yeah probably

yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do uh wait

let me let me check on this real quick

uh I'm gonna try to levitate him so he

can't go anywhere all right okay so he

has got to make because he's unwilling a

constitution saving through oh boy here

we go

um alright you levitate him how high how

high do you want to levitate him just

off the ground or like 30 feet up I'd

say well you can levitate him up to 20

feet actually so yeah so if I were to

Levitan like 10 feet he wouldn't be able

like reach anything

forex really leverage right I'm going to

do ten feet okay so he goes levitating

up ten feet like I had I got him what do

we do

it's that Darth paltin coming up pretty

hard he's like force lift I'm just one

guy guys iceberg now all right

that's Paul tunes turn strix you're

still in the lodge on your pan and

you've got the chicken oh I have the

chicken now

all right I'm gonna go put the chicken

in one of the cages up above all right

feeling you that is your action in your

movement great great yeah I cuz I hide

I'm like here you go little buddy

I mean giant I mean alright and the

three-headed chicken is now in the cage

and you lock it you just pull the latch

there it goes Oh gross some snacks in

there right

they will sniff the snacks with his beat

and then the heads will fight over the

snacks good great alright and yes yep

what do you do you're saying you're

still in the lodge at this point paltin

has run outside evylyn has run outside

and most of the crew is outside yeah

basically took took care of our chicken

problem yeah that's been taken care of

cheering the shouting from palton and

things I'm gonna actually head over

towards him okay try to join him but

still repin at the ready but my focus is

not going to be on artist who's now

floating in the air but rather I am

watching the movements and actions of

every single one of the black-robe dudes

it came with sandala because I trust

them less than I trust this guy

alright as you sort of are in the

doorway now watching these guys I'd like

you to make a perception check to see if

you notice anything odd about them or

anything else oh please be good 15 okay

you can see that they are standing with

their blades out they don't seem to be

taking any threatening moves not yet

although they look battle ready they

also look like they're waiting for

orders but your roll is just high enough

to see peeling out of the dark sky

this it is I wish we had an iceberg

right now it is it is us you see it come

down sort of just dropping like a stone

into the rift like it was perched on

some high ledge waiting just waiting for

a sign and it's just swooping in the

direction of maybe it lacks chicken Oh a

step of the steps they're in cahoots

it's really really big and even though

it's quite dark you can see that this

this is an old dragon okay it might even

be the same dragon you saw back at the

Ranger's Lodge it looks at be about the

same size only that one was farther away

oh I bet it might imagine death is just

going to believe it is yeah

so yes the mouth just gets a little

wider yeah I just just like all right

you dragon cultist son of a bear how do

you want to do or say anything at this

time because it looks like all eyes are

on the figure who's being levitated off

the steps yeah so as triumphantly and

bravely as possible I'm just going to

make sure I say it loud enough so that

everyone can hear okay and alert

everyone to the presence of incoming

potential danger probable danger its

danger all right

yes those of you now that now that DF is

pointing it out and saying that can see

stealthily swooping in hard to see

against the the white walls of the

canyon but there it is big ass dragon

that's new all right cool

and that brings us to she's out of the

play some dollar so I'm still in the

place right yeah you're you're inside

the place your career is just outside

and then further down you can see paltin

levitating artists off the steps okay I

think I'm going to run towards my crew

and really them because I assume I've

heard DF screaming about the dragon

right yes okay I'm going to reload them

and point to the dragon and tell all of

them to attack as soon as it's in range

for them they all look at you like

you're crazy like they just they're all

turning heads for you simultaneously

their weapons sort of sag a little bit

and then you just see even through the

mass even through the masks that they

where they're looking at you like you

just gave them a suicide order okay

don't let say anything but the message

is clear I'd like to run I would like to

continue to move towards DF can I reach

the s within my I'm gonna run up to DF

pretend I'm readying for battle and

quietly say to him we need to get that

stone from his elfia I know you're the

one to do this sorry stone the the

talking stone thingy

alright yeah that thing we need that

zelphia

they do kind of all look the same

you remember which one is Elfie is

you'll figure it out but before they die

we need that it's doing okay or if

they die we need that stone okay

all right just just precautions here no

no crazy like secret motives you just

need that stone I'll tell you later

just if you can don't please don't hurt

yourself doing it but I would if an

opportunity arises I'll make one I'll

obtain it you just keep yourself alive

and make sure no one else gets hurt okay

all right your crew goes after you son

doula and Nez Roth says the captain's

turn them against us kill her I'll point

the cultists three of them will pull out

bladed daggers and hurl them at you

sandela you can your AC goes up by five

you have a missile weapons you have

armor class 18 now all three steal

weapons bounced off the shield the other

three or two of them are going to

basically try to grab Evelyn and paltin

evylyn the one that grabs you rolled a

22 on the it on the strength check so I

need you to make a strength check that

started I said 22 I meant 16 16 on the

strength check roll a strength check for

yourself to see if you're grappled there

try to try to grab our robot mm-hmm she

is maybe she doesn't look mostly to them

all right so your grappled by one

actually the one that

knocked you up and everything the one

whose name the one whose name the one

whose name's Althea what the sending

stone is the one that grabs

evylyn and the other one groped and

paltin make a strength check well I am

I'm still holding in love I'm just like

wait what's happening oh that would be a

twenty-one

all right paltin actually is not

grappled he fights off though the guy

who's trying to go and then miss Roth is

going to leap up twenty feet into the

air with his little cape and grab on to

artists and succeeds and with his weight

actually pulls artists back down to the

ground they just fall because they

levitate targets one and so they crashed

down back onto the steps with MS Roth on

top of artists basically grabbing him by

the wrists alright that's it for the

dragon cultists and it is evil UNS turn

evil and you are being held by one of

the dragon cultists excuse me i just try

to get on grandpa because i can't do

anything until i am okay well you could

you could try to it you could attack

while they're grappling you that's

possible but it's probably better if you

try to break the grapple and then do

your thing because it would be a

strength check versus an attack at

disadvantage i would yeah

and so you you can either make a

strength check to break the grab or a

dexterity or strength athlete extra

dexterity acrobatics your choice you

probably want to go with athletics I

assume yeah alright I would like to hit

them in the head with light fall though

so I'm debating that it would be a

disadvantage right checking so your

speed becomes zero

you can't benefit to speed but you do

not have disadvantage well then what I

want to do is like they grapple me I had

light fall in my hand all right I

imagine they kind of grabbed me like

over here main tree bang I've got

treatment like this there grab me like

this yes try to donk them on the head

with it

all right 12 12 is not enough I made the

wrong choice yes and you can't move

while grappled so you're basically done

okay paltin you're it's your turn so

artists even though he's technically

levitating his back down with dragon

cultist on him and they're okay is he

fighting the dragon cult is always

trying to get his hands on artists his

ring take it by force uh how far are

they from me oh they're really close

they're like five feet away from you

okay all right they're like one step

down from you I'm also right next to you

yes so you are in my aura of protection

okay which will come in handy

momentarily huh noted uh can I try -

thunder wave in between them to try and

separate them you'd hit them both but

you could well one of them good they

could get blown away in different

directions so yeah oh yeah that's what

I'm trying to do sir absolutely I'm just

like ah this guy looks pretty strong he

can take it

alright and they gotta make same throws

here we go alright the dragon cultists

okay well let's see both the dragon

cultists and oh no this is a

constitution save my bad mm alright okay

so the dragon cultist saved and is not

pushed but artists failed and is works

for me

alright so roll your damage the dragon

cultists will take half and artists will

take all all right that would be a total

of eight eight mmm-hmm so artistic eight

and Miss roster for artist goes tumbling

down two more steps as the as the sound

wave hits him sorry I did yeah he gives

you a momentary glance but actually his

eyes are on the dragon and he shouts up

at the dragon yeah bring it yet dumb

arctic bat oh hold on and palton would

you like to move at all

that was just an action for you yeah I'm

gonna hmm okay so did I knocked him

closer to the dragon

well the dragons coming down from above

oh so it does you knocked him away from

the moment from pretty much everybody

else so he's kind of out there by

himself a little bit further down the

steps from you something tells me I

should stay near evylyn so I really have

I'm just like hmm alright I'm gonna I'm

gonna do that

alright I would like everybody to make a

wisdom saving thrilled exper Strix who's

not here

that's dragon dragon fears taking old I

have had the worst rolls I don't think I

don't read about the pen alright nine

nine isn't gonna do it 15:15 is safe

you're good nineteen you're good oh well

alright so palton and evylyn are so

overwrought with fear that you are

frightened which means on your turn no

you're quaking in your bolts and doesn't

doesn't being so drunk that might

actually be true and your your desire to

claim the ring might be enough to resist

it you know I'm gonna give you oh I

almost forgot

evylyn and Strix you haven't you have

inspiration from before you don't have

to be scared for your song for your song

so if you want to use that now yeah that

would be good time all right

it was like she starts to look scared

and she's like you know I will find the

light of Lysander and myself and I will

find bravery all right eighteen very

good and palton you get another save

because you convinced me something from

my aura yeah I probably wouldn't you get

a bonus equal to your charisma modifier

to my crazy modifier which would be my

charisma is plus 5 so you plus 5 to the

role on top of that so I look up at the

dragon I feel a hint of fear yeah and I

say lose feelings

very good okay infamous 820 yes comes up

at the most surprising time okay so

dragon fear does not take hold of any of

you I have to roll for the cultists not

this one all right two of them are so

struck by fear it looks like they are

going to withdraw as quickly as possible

four of them however resist and I have

completely lost track of initiative so

whole thing just just went straight

strikes all right so I didn't see any of

this dragon business you heard you heard

death call out dragons so you know okay

probably around this time you would hear

a big woosh sound as its weight drop

alright um woman I'm just I'm gonna go

fly out as my movement to go just see

you what's going that's when you see the

big dragon bearing toward you I'm just

like oh do I see my friends also grapple

you see evylyn grappled

palton has slapped away the one trying

to grab him and that so evylyn is the

only party member who is currently being

grappled alright cuz I really don't like

that I like strikes just like turns

white and like seeing any of her party

grab just is you can't have them grab

bad so she's not gonna let that happen

even though there's a dragon so she is

going to cast fireball onto the dragon

cultists all of them and it's gonna be

fifth level spell just like a panic okay

careful spell for artists as well and

anyone that's not a dragon coldest okay

you won't get artists cuz he was blasted

away about the under wave but and you'll

get all the cultists and you'll be able

to sculpt around

evylyn okay so to make not happy seeing

them grappled

what does that mean from Chris Burton's

41 holy okay so um so that's gonna

be 20 for everybody else so Misrata and

zelphia are singed

by the flames and they just sort of they

sort of manage to avoid most of them the

other four are completely incinerated

and just fall into flaming heaps on the

stairs even graduate she holds out her

hands and she just looks at Strix and

goes yes so the only two cultists left

are the one that went after the ring

that just got blasted away from artists

and artists got blasted away from him

and the one holding on to evylyn the

other for collapse and are clearly most

sincerely dead search just has this like

wild panicked look in her like you

haven't seen her look like this before

it's scary like she's not gonna let this

happen okay I look at Strix and I go

dalla you realize at this point in time

that you need at least four crew members

to operate your ship what do you do the

Dragons here no drag the dragon is going

to go after you I

following his and Elle's direction i

sprint towards nazareth okay

who so artist was blasted away from him

yes

he's ten feet away from artists right

now okay so upon my my surveillance of

him earlier on the ship was I able to

kind of determine where he generally

tries to hide that stone on his person

he doesn't have it Sophia the one

grappling evylyn does I'm sorry zelphia

that's when I want to go for I'm sorry

great alright so I'm going up to is elf

the event what I know where he has it

you good yes you know you know where she

keeps it you could use a slight hand to

check to take it off her

okay yes so even though she thinks she's

grappling Eveland is evylyn who's

grappling her allowing me to go run up

and try to swipe or try to swipe the

stone off of her go ahead and make you a

check okay

just sleight of hand yep all right it's

pretty good uh that's gonna be 31 yeah

you snatch it great I don't have any

other actions after that do I that's it

that's that's it and she didn't even she

didn't even notice that you took it

she's too busy grappling evil and to

know that you've sought the stone

miss Roth can clearly see that you've

got it

I don't care cutting action - and I'll

return back to Zhen de la all right

you bring the stone back to son Bella

it's at that time that the dragon

descends upon you and and upon artists

oh the dragon knows artists is not going

to be hurt by its breath weapon so it is

going to land its claws crunching and

and throwing up all kinds of ice and

snow as it lands in front of artists

about ten feet away from you paltin

Oracle actually probably a 15 feet away

from you you're the closest character to

it

this dragon it is humongous bigger than

bigger than a Cessna and it says

something in draconic anybody here speak

that language that would because I'm

dollar yeah I could speak like three

words which basically amounts to give me

the ring it's mine and then it will

attempt to bite artists claw him and

we'll see what happens then it does

succeed inviting artists No

then it claws him misses him with the

first claw actually but hits him with

the second so he was hit by the bite and

one claw artists is looking bloodied

after that brief exchange and then the

dragon says something turns to the rest

of you and says something in Turkana

cans and allah' you translate that to be

this is between hem you got it

that sounds great yeah I think we're

good here and after the dragon does that

it is is on Delos turn u DF has the

stone he's right next to you again yeah

brought it to you he is near me yeah

he's holding it up basically

what uh Chris do I know about this

dragon and its relationship to other

dragons this dragon in front of you yeah

you don't know much

alrighty it could be what given its size

you think this dragon might be the white

dragon I so he dress which is known to

live in the spine of the world mountains

the Harper's report that it has a it

basically took over what appears to be a

crashed flying Citadel in the mountains

and turned it into its icy lair and it

may or may not be friends with other

dragons it is white dragons tend to be

stupid and belligerent they generally do

not get along well with friends all

right they read even get along with each

other okay

um I'm going to this dragon is actually

given its size and age you think is

slightly dumber than your average human

all right I'm going to cast polymorph on

it okay

that's my spell I'm a dragon and turn it

into a smaller dragon

I would like to a snowman it has to be a

creature oh darn it and it's a beast so

it's a basically an animal

is what you're here for Muslim okay I

only suggest a chicken yeah I know

uh let's I don't know let's let's go

with I mean artist did refer to it as a

big Arctic bat so you could turn into a

bat bats are pretty harmless fly away i

oh this is such a that's fine but if a

chicken tried hard I weigh so much

creativity to be had here Jules no how

about a sea cucumber okay

but first he has to make a saving throw

this is a wisdom saving throw against

your DC of 15 that is a success your

spell does not take hold of hit Nepal

Eber returns to you right turns view

with it's icy Glacial eyes and says

that's my only actions your only action

you'd like to move however I would like

to move by the way take taking that star

would also be considered like part of

your move you don't have to use an

action to take the stone off of I will

take the stone off of DF alright I say

to jump not go away from me I run back

into lodge the lodge okay alright you

can see draconic runes on this stone

you've seen this stone before zelphia

wasn't hiding it from you right and you

know who it connects to connects to this

fella um can I speak into the stone and

say that would be an action next round

darn it hold that thought think about

what you're gonna say cuz I'll ask you

next time is that really that much

bigger yeah this is actual comparison

and this is a DF like comparison that

would be d say that's right there he's

just saying hi yeah but let's worry

about this one first shall we

oh that was just like approaching out of

nowhere no the red ones not around oh I

don't wanna give you that impression

sogndal is about to dial up the red one

God all right and next step is let's see

that was sandala so

we come to artists oh boy alright

fighting a dragon wasn't what he had in

mind

is it ever what anyone has in mind

really yes but he will take the glove

off his hand and reveal an icy ring on

one finger and he is going to use it to

try to cast a spell on the dragon

through the ring okay

a dragon oh that's interesting I wasn't

expecting that

what's interesting okay so the as the

dragon turns its attention back to

artist sees artist has this ring pointed

at it and as the ring flashes with light

suddenly the dragon its scales and flesh

begin to harden and actually transform

into ice he is turning it from a living

creature into an ice sculpture all right

cool but it's this ice transformation is

just beginning to sort of happen to the

dragon this is this is a flesh to stone

spell variant called flesh to ice and

yes so you see the dragon is beginning

to undergo the transformation and is

suddenly kind of restrained it can't

move its feet now ice are anchored to

the floor or to the ground all right if

it fails to save three times it will be

a ice statue okay

that's it for him Oh artists can move

since the dragon is restrained artists

is going to run away from it he's

running toward the airship he moves 30

feet away from you guys toward the

airship bears on that

[Music]

the dragon will at the end of artists

turn use a legendary action if he can

actually there's nothing he can reach

okay so that's it okay next up is evylyn

oh I forgot Sofia she had you grappled

and she is not afraid of the dragon so

she is going to let go of you evylyn and

go running after artists hmm at which

point or actually she's about to and

then miss Roth says no the captain took

your stone go get it and zelphia will

and then - up the stairs sort of leaping

and bounding up the stairs using her

cape or wings or whatever power she has

to make these great great leaps do I get

an attack of opportunity on her when she

since she intends to attack Sanyal at

the end of her move yes she is not

disengaging from you so good lady

follow-up question yes running past DF

Isabelle she will have to run past DF as

well bring your a-game wait what you

guys that was 14 as well like alright

okay rolling the damage and it's crit so

you roll the die roll your damage dice

twice okay

twice then oh for crying out loud

well alright the first is 7

and then 11 so 18 medical tree bein

damaged all right

she's greatly greatly wounded by that

and is quite bloodied as she dashes away

from you and DF you get to attack her as

well it's just a normal attack for you

okay twelve okay she dodges out of the

way of your attack damn it and then

we'll come around the corner and while

you're getting ready to speak into the

stone was all fiha will attempt to stab

you is on delay oh my god

alright she crits you sorry yeah you can

throw your shield up but she's gonna hit

you anyway even with your AC love all

right oh but she rolled shitty damage so

you take eight points damage how many

left

let's see you took fifty something so

you've taken 64 points yeah you have

seven hit points left all right

she's got yes she's got a second attack

though oh my god Chris she roll the

natural 19 so that's gonna hit you even

the shield and she does another no seven

right side damage

no way actually she hit it right on the

head I'm dead

well you're down dad and so she sticks

you with the blade twice you drop and

like the stone just sort of falls into

her and actually just lies on the floor

now so she has taken you down miss Roth

is coming after you DF he rolls a 22 on

his first attack okay and a sixteen on

his second alright I deflect a 16 with

the

gutter all right he hits you for 6

points of damage

come on kitty dodge 300 points of damage

a glancing blow it's like I don't even

care about it and then you hear him say

do you got it and you here's all filled

yeah oh you can't see say I got it but I

heard him

you heard them both okay and then it is

my turn he wins turn I don't know

anything about this stone right none of

it has been communicated to me

d/f told you last week that the dragon

cultists were using the stone for covert

communication so I did I see this

exchange take place I know that no D F

sort of ran up behind her grab the stone

disappeared ran back up the stairs while

you were being grappled so yeah I will

say you saw D F come down and take

something off her so it doesn't take you

much to figure out what that might be

okay so I do know that this stone is

important and it's in contention yes yes

and I saw them take down you also know

however that artist is running toward

the airship my child or my new friend

that has fallen in battle Oh Who am I

closer to you are closer to you are

actually about equidistant so there make

that tough choice last time I let

someone sit when they were down that was

a bad decision so evil ins like uh and

she dashes toward sandala okay okay well

yeah she she attacks what's her name

again Sophia Sophia yeah okay I attack

though yeah all right you come up behind

Sophia with Ferber yes put that down and

she's just a she's just she's just about

to reach sort of crouch down and pick

the stone off the floor when you kind of

a

next to her little honoring ooh that

time I got a 26 hit array and eight

damaged with tree bein that takes her

down haha I know I don't have another

action doing you would but you can't use

it to do anything but attack I mean it's

either double action or so I just stand

there looking at the stone thinking man

I wish I could lay hands on that alright

and then it is Paul toons turn as the

dragon begins to turn to ice and it's

freaking out a little bit palton you see

on the other side of the Dragon artist

running away from you an artist has the

ring oh yes he's just demonstrated part

one of its powers right before your eyes

I'm gonna so I'd have to get by the

dragon right yeah you'd have to get

around to that beast I'm gonna like

sorry sorry

[Laughter]

artists okay now you can use a double

move to catch up to him I'm gonna use a

double move to catch up to him movement

despair when you get to him but you have

no actions left but you can talk to him

stop he will he will point to the ship

and say how many people does it take to

fly that thing

at least however many are still back

there

alright you should go help your friends

you should stay right there he says if

you go help your friends all wait for

you can I like this entire conversation

is happening guys are like yes exactly

yeah

do I have an inkling of if he's telling

the truth you can make an insight jack

of course cool no no no no no I don't

know

alright best cutscenes Nate you think

that there is a sincerity to that you

believe him completely he does not look

like he's trying to deceive or be

dishonest

another Nate 20 yeah I'll be back

alright and excuse me excuse me

alright DF you've got a dragon cultist

leader in front of you great sounds like

evylyn is well in control of the

business inside the lodge yeah if I'm

just aware of that all those to handle

the immediate threat in front a then yes

I'll just like like this is the same one

that attacked me right yes okay yes

after hitting me and like the deflecting

like the last attack then it's just like

a hard stab right up into the abdomen as

hard as possible with gutter 2020 is a

hit okay and then it's not no sneak

attack damage there's just criminal

attack bonus yeah nothing freezing on

four seven okay he looks very badly hurt

good and the dragon goes next I'm sorry

strings yes you're right yes what do you

want to do strike sorry about that

probably scared anyway so I could indeed

just average to sue myself his raw have

the drive the last dragon cultist

standing outside okay great so

I don't want to be in the breath weapon

zone of the Dragon so I would like to

move out of that first however I can

just get behind him that's none of that

and I'm just going to go ahead and I

want to hit that guy with something know

how many there's only one dragon koltes

left there is only one left standing at

the top of the stairs fighting death and

he's burned by your previous spell right

like he's bloodied him a great bloom of

flame it wraps around UDF just out of

nowhere all right

Ezra failed so early a damage I did

really bad damage I only did 16 damage

okay well that's enough to kill him DF

you seen Israel's just sort of explode

from the inside out into flames and his

his mask just sort of burn off his face

yeah this happens right yes sorts allow

just yeah exactly

and like ashes of him or so a sort of

ash and shaped version is Rafa standing

before you and then he just sort of just

shake the store a little coal ash fall

huh yes and his weapons clatter onto the

icy steps and all of the dragon cultists

are down or dead

and that's Strix now sorry we are on ice

ax he dress the dragon is going to can't

move can't make so all these God is his

breath weapon you can teach artists with

it so he is going to turn that icy blast

on

you you can't hits tricks and really

it's all just gonna be you dia all right

so I need you to make a constitution

saving through Constitution Constitution

yeah I retract all right ice particles

hail and just magical cold wash over you

and blast through the entrance of the

lodge evylyn you would have been caught

in it but you just sort of pull your way

around the corner next to Zahn dollas

slumped form and avoid getting struck by

this Blizzard DF you take 54 points of

cold damage what are your hip points

currently yeah if is like blasted

backwards and falls onto covered in ice

and is unconscious

all right yes oh yeah everybody just

chill out

I mean or too late my so he dressed

fails his second saving throw more of

his form turns to transparent ice and it

is is on dollas turn death save for me

yep 10 10 so that is good news

that's one success you are one step

closer to stabilizing on your own even

without assistance and it is the crew is

gone so bla bla bla

evylyn I look at the dollar I'm like

sorry just like hold on

you kneel down to the frozen form of

death

yeah and I lay on hands all right a

bunch ice melts away as the healing

light of Lysander washes over here dear

friend mm-hmm let's say like 25 is that

good that's yeah that's like half my

head points all right yeah all right

yeah more of those yeah that warm glow

is the is the most wonderful feeling in

this cold horrible place you could not

have imagined awaking to a better

feeling I'm like I'm laying my hands on

his cheeks

yeah even like if they come back I'm

like I grab around really quick like

hard like like by the shoulder or just

kind of cloak like it's kind of holding

her hostage is the moment just PD heavy

breathing

Boracay like stepping back to it okay

you're warm and safe and Lysander's

bless you I have to go heal someone else

like that even after that ideas like

just turns back it's like help the

others like let go all right uh even

even notices that cuz you know he still

has all these weapons and stuff and she

as she was kneeling down her leg kind of

bumps the flame sword and she's like the

hardest Spinelli you using that Oh

and I just like untouched it all right

and that palton you just saw your friend

DF get blasted back into the lodge by a

cone of ice he's ready to dodge it but

then you realize that doesn't work what

would you like to do you are not the

only one here with the dragon

Gary make my way back you kind of did

okay you're sort of at the bottom of the

steps

about 20 feet away from the dragon I was

like running up and I did I did that

thing where like I just put my feet out

and makes like brake noises

yes exactly vonda's blast of cold went

over your head and hit the top of the

stairs but d adds up now you can't see

him as far as far as you know he's dead

he got blasted away by the force of it

like now before I would just run in

there I'm going to could I like but I

like play uh oh wait no I already use

that shoot crap um I'm gonna go

invisible and go in you play a note on

your mandolin and you're invisible and

when you go up into the lodge you see

that Evelyn has brought death back and

he's all fine dripping water from the

ice that has melted away you also say he

next to the doorway sangala

is unconscious and the sending stone

that her cultists used is lying by her

I'm gonna do I know that's important

you've you've been told that it's the

device that the cultists used to speak

to their dragon master whether you were

listening or remember is another thing

that you have been told I already made

myself invisible so I guess I guess I'll

at least go over there

All Right see you kneel down and that's

the end of your turn the Strix okay so I

watched this unfold and see my friends

all enter the hut yes fine so you're the

you're the one who's outside now with

the dragon

yeah no you're I'm gonna your high up

I'm just gonna zoom down back into the

vine all right I'm just land next to

Eagle in and said da line everyone done

oh and I'm also still concerned about

that dragon but everyone's okay so good

job I'm also gonna cast death ward on

Diaz just behind him like

[Laughter]

[Music]

mr. X has it covered okay good thing we

like tap me on one shoulder but walk the

other way

all right

yep you see this witch's hat walk past

you in a weird direction yeah okay all

right expected my action it is okay zom

dolla up yet or no no she sailed down

and paulten is next to her with the

stone by his feet okay

I'm not gonna fight a dragon no I also

don't wanna do I know where artist is

during all of this you have no idea

where's artists I say out loud oh he's

waiting it's okay what no it's okay I

trust him now great hearing this what do

you do oh I guess I'll just kinda make

my way towards the entrance but off to

this side Scott kick my head out around

the corner see if I can see past the

dragon yeah because you're up high on on

the top of the giant stairs leading up

to the lodge you can actually see over

the dragon okay just trying to look for

artists or wherever the heck's going on

just trying to get reassess what's going

on okay perception check yeah because I

see heaters are still basically like

stuck in places yes this dragon is

fighting with all its might to resist

the power of this spell

all right perception 23 all right you

see over the bay on the dragon the

airship through the lightly falling snow

is still parked there and it looks like

from this distance that sort Godfrey is

pulling artists Kimber on to the ship

okay basically using a rope to lower

down and then pull artists up all right

I know they can't fly without us because

we accrue there's what to there that's

not gonna be enough okay so they can't

leave without us

not unless the pseudo dragon can help

them somehow but that that's even not

enough waffles can't fly it so they

don't have the crew I'd like to see that

though is it my B's okay

as in like a trained crew or just a crew

of trained crew is ideal but an

untrained crew with a captain who knows

what she's doing

could manage at least you know do basic

things like get the ship up okay all

right I'm going to just base I'm gonna

stay with since inside nearby the hut

and my allies yeah and just stay out of

breath range or good call yeah and then

just his turn he's got nothing to attack

and he's got to make a very fateful as

you're watching outside I saw he dress

the adult white dragon turns into an ice

sculpture the irony is not lost upon him

actually had totally lost upon him like

guys just that was so easy

his last frustrated roar snuffed out in

an instant as his head freezes and he

turns transparent we've done it at

Dragon Slayer to wild list of

accomplishments preface start a list of

accomplishments at the top Dragon Slayer

Mottola make another DEATH save 9 that's

a failure so you got one success in one

failure like yeah yeah we're Dragon

Slayers we did that together French oh

oh crap

and leads down lays on hand

how much healing are you gonna give her

uh I have a lot laughs let's give her

like she can have 20 all right you have

20 hit points Santa Fe can I like walk

up to this new ice sculpture and just

kind of I think it's dead I like I like

rise forward and I'm like what happened

you see the stone lying at your feet

okay I pick it up I hear the term like

here you go I look up and here you go

it's all fine don't worry and I also can

I burn that that I statue because I

think that'd be real fun yeah go ahead

okay awesome

I got with though with the hardest

Spinelli specifically I'm kind of like

testing it hatching it in my hand

because I haven't held this in a long

time I'm like kind of brandishing it

around and then I'm like ah and I stab

the ice statue with it all right

it has igniting and fire damage you know

I want a stabby stabby melt evil theater

all right under fall on her bliss okay

so you go outside to stab this thing

Paul turn in D F you're hanging out here

Dani are you picking up the stone this

point is I'm thinking what do you do

when you get it I okay you feel it's

warm like

unnaturally hot in your hand and

actually when you hold it a voice comes

through like it was waiting for

something and that voice says report

oh man everything's fine here we're fine

everything's fine how are you and injure

conic I respond

we lost the crew but we found the ring

just give me time I can still make this

work I have grown impatient yeah yeah I

know but your your your there's another

dragon here everyone's dying I can still

make it work but I've been going to you

on three days and then it severs the

connection it's always three days man Oh

bondola

just like pockets it and rolls her eyes

a little bit so how'd it go first I want

to thank you all for saving me I know

you guys work together so I really

appreciate that um I don't know how you

got that dragon frozen that's super cool

everybody inside everybody inside the

lodge make a perception check am i

inside or outside outside you're outside

with the sword about you're plunging it

into the frozen dragon and the sword had

some additional resistance like it hits

the ice pink but as the flames start to

make their you can sort of shove the

sword up into the ice and kind of melt a

holy God yeah you think that would take

a tremendous amount of time like I like

you stick the sword in and as the flames

burn it creates sort of it causes the

water from its to sort of pour out and

you've created basically a whole kind of

like sticking a toothpick in too soft

I see and you think given time you can

sort of put this thing through the ice

and carve out your name but everybody

else there's like water back on the ship

artists is just looking off toward her

and saying to sir Godfrey what is she

doing and sir Godfrey's like I have no

idea but paltin what was your perception

check and I saw Bella what was yours Oh

fifteen I don't add anything to mine you

don't and deaath what was yours thank

you okay D F you notice as Angela's

talking to you that Strix is gone

sorry and Strix in the moment before you

left you heard something it was like

somebody talking over your shoulder like

somebody just come up to you from behind

and started talking over your shoulder

but it was arcane gobbledygook as the

arcane gobbledygook was being spoken you

suddenly realized that it was it's some

sort of infernal incantation and I'm not

okay with that and in that moment of

thought you're gone god waver am i

warmer at least yes he starts looking

around like Napoli and then like asks

everyone else just like Rishi restricts

it's like she was kind of wandering

around over there and then there's

nothing there Paul was just like are you

talking about she's oh I'm not with

the chicken nope you're nowhere to be

seen

she's outside there's no there's like no

trees or tracks or anything of her on

the ground

when you look on sort of the because the

dragon's blast sort of came in some snow

and stuff in here you can see that her

footsteps stopped at a certain point and

then nothing okay she do that a lot

no what did you do where is she where

would I send her what did she go

somewhere does she like poof or is that

something she knows what you saw DF is

Jean dalla talking into the stone having

a conversation that you couldn't hear

and then Strix disappearing I like to

stop up like grab her and like polar and

real close and like say again what did

you do and I'll say again I don't know

what happened

I'm talking to my boss you know we wait

we got the stone it was all cool this

has nothing to do with your friend who

pooped if we can go look for her I would

rather go look for her she had magic

stuff it was cool what kind of like push

her away like it's like half shove her

to the ground

and he'll say then who is that what

you're talking who you're talking to

honestly the the guy I'm talking to is

the guy who gave me the ship he's a very

large red dragon he's coming in three

days and that's all he said

he's mad that his crews dead but

honestly I I don't mind that they're

caught in a half a deathlike steps out

of a hut right away and you see even

down there why his hands and yelling his

lousy can start yelling for yelling

strix his name okay even you hear DF

calling out Strix his name as though

looking for her I also assist in that

all right both of them are on the steps

calling out Strix his name like some

water she said runs over what's going on

where what and as soon as she finds out

the Strix is missing she starts flying

and looking up

in the like you know inside the horn and

in the chicken cage and stuff because

she's convinced baby strict blew away on

the broom she just keeps looking and

keeps looking she's not what I give up

guys you guys sorry go ahead

well everybody's looking I want to like

close my eyes real quick and ask summer

wise what's happening on the ship and if

everything's okay you are out of range

of summarizes telepathy maybe she went

back to the ship she probably just went

back the ship she gets scared sometimes

she misty steps right what that looks

like let's go to get back to the ship

hard and you get on board and you can

see artist is still there he's sort of

been striking up a conversation with sir

Godfrey while you're gone they pull you

on board with ropes and sir Godfrey asks

what has become of your crew you tell

him they have not seen strikes she has

not appeared back on the ship but they

advise is on Bella you left the ship in

a readied state to take off when as soon

as you got back so you can bark you can

give orders to these guys and tell them

what to do to get the ship aloft if

that's what you want to do now we're not

leaving her here we have to go to find

strike so it's up to you guys would

would it make sense to get up in the air

and look from there or it is a on foot

pretty make more sense so once we're up

on the ship yes

I'm cheese gutter takes out a key it

turns the lock all right you're God you

can't play Holly as DF turns the key in

gutter a gateway opens to a distant

plane all right as this is going on

paltin you kind of feel a little weird

and there's like a little itch on the

side of your neck and as you pull your

hand away there's like a piece of flesh

that tears off your neck in your hand

and that's where we're gonna stop

my longest huh ever alright folks that's

the end of season 2 season 3 will kick

off on September 19th with the launch of

the adventure Tomb of annihilation until

Dave I'm standing alright I have to I'm

just responding to a tweet somebody said

oh why didn't I say he'd receive his

legendary resistance in action it's

because he used them up fighting the

frost giants earlier so he was actually

he was actually weakened from his

earlier battles with the frost giants

could not kill him just in case

anybody's wondering yeah he had a whole

big fight here long before the waffle

crew showed up is the wreckage in the

rift would indicate so I really wanted

to have a nice chat with those giant

ladies in a cat-cat cosplay they

conflict evil in all right somebody also

want to cry to me that our season

premiere for season 3 is

September 19th Talk Like a Pirate Day oh

you guys are on the airship so maybe

your ass crew will be a pirate crew nice
