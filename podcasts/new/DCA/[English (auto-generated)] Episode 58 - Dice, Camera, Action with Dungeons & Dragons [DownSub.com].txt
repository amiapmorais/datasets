hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action so a last-minute thing Nate had

something come up so he couldn't make it

today session he is deeply deeply sorry

and so he knows he knows it's gonna be a

toughy but I have his character sheet

paltin is still in play and so we'll

just what we get and everything is fine

everything is fine so when last we left

the waffle crew oh boy things things

went a certain way and attempts were

made to poison strawed and to steal his

sword and Strix lit a tapestry on fire

that he had given to his brother as a

gift that depicted his father King bear

off and then after the waffle crew

helped the bride and groom to be escaped

in a carriage straw it came out and DF

stabbed him in the back and palton tried

to insource all strods

steed the black stallion boasts a palace

but that did not work out so well and we

ended last week's session with straw -

turning to confront his back stabber now

evil enduring the surprise round you

were the only one who didn't take an

action is there anything you'd like to

do in this moment no is an acceptable

answer

so just to give you a lay of the land

you are standing out in the courtyard

in front of the castle proper surrounded

on all sides by towering walls a

gatehouse ahead of you with the

drawbridge down but some distance away

about 60 feet away straud is out here

raha Dean sort of withdrew somewhat into

the castle and not only is the waffle

car out here but also the baby owl bear

and little Simon who's got who sort of

tugging on Paul tans coattails he's just

turned around after death just pulled

gutter his sword out of strods back it

has strods blood on it and dripping on

to the ground straw himself is straat

himself is armed with a short sword that

he pulled from a secret compartment in

his chair alright you can use your

channel divinity to invoke primeval

forces to ensnare a foe as an action

you've caused spectral vines to spring

up reaching for the creature it must

succeed on a strength or dexterity

saving throw its choice or be restrained

and it can repeat the save later on

later rounds so to speak alright alright

so and Strada is the intended target

right yes okay what is your save DC you

can go with dexterity

17 all right

he blows that out of the water with a 27

so yeah the spectral vines grasp for him

but are unable to sneer him where he

roll in natural 24 all right so that's

the end of the surprise round now we go

to regular initiative you hear raha dean

in the foyer call out for the castle

guards and then he withdraws deeper into

the castle as you recall he was badly

badly wounded last session not only was

he attacked but also and and hit by a

cone of cold but he also got trampled by

strods coach and so he's pretty messed

up his weapon was destroyed half his

face is missing and so he's he sort of

disappears into the heart of the castle

and Ana

evylyn as he what as you watch raha Dean

vanish into the dark interior you can

still see that the vez thani seer

Caterina is there but staying out of

combat staying out of trouble

lips limps past her and then we circle

back around to strips I couldn't find my

window I'm still fine yeah but I would

like to get on my broom okay and go into

the sky okay your broom moves 60 so you

fly 60 feet up in the air which doesn't

get you above the castle walls yeah like

30 is fine okay I don't want to go too

far I just want to get out of there

reach all right you can hop on the broom

and jet 30 feet and still have an

if you want cool yeah I would like to do

I actually have the drowse spell book

still so I'm going to pull out the drow

spell book and try and cast Everards

black tentacles make an Arcana check yes

I've never done before

that's the Arcana check the problem I'm

gonna say this is a disadvantage because

you're riding on a broom okay oh come on

[Laughter]

florrum it's very windy night and the

pages are please blowing and you got one

hand on the room and you're like using

your mouth to try to peel the pages back

and it's just the total disaster this is

a scene seen happening above you almost

dropped the book No and okay so that's

stress that's it good luck at the right

on strods turn the horse the horse will

come up to him and strawed will pull

himself up onto its back he is going to

get voke an opportunity attack from UDF

yes Sam okay daddy

sadly my Ally is no longer within 5 feet

of my enemy that's true so regular stab

it is okay

23:23 is a hint

good ok but this is not a sneak attack

or any other kind of fancy damage okay

it is just regular attack yes ok once

again you draw royal blood go out there

slash across them and you sense that

gutter your sword is very very satisfied

to taste this royal blood

this displeases me Oh say anything

please oh come on all right

then

straud will guide his horse away from

you and they will gallop toward the

drawbridge and they will get pretty much

all the way though they'll get as far as

being underneath the gatehouse beyond

the portcullis but not quite to the

drawbridge the horse is moving very

quickly all out in fact and then that's

their turn next up is evylyn well my

last try really failed I am going to I

can't reach Stroud right now you would

have to double move and Strada is the

only baddie still around us yes

although raha Dean just called for the

guards I guess I run I run to be near

dear I'm just gonna go run that port

yeah yes yeah it doesn't even have to

run far it's about ten feet away from

him so okay all right so you're by DF

side and DF you are aware of her

presence and I guess I if I have a an

action left to cast a spell I would pass

sorry guys my spell cards that I usually

have are not with me at the moment um

I'm gonna cast bless at first level on

Jer on on da Hey

okay now you can actually bless up to

three creatures in 30 feet so you can

get its tricks as well oh yeah I forgot

about pollen he saw that Oh y'all

alright Strix DF paulten we'll all get a

d4 on top of their attack rolls and

saving throws sweet flowing from inside

you that the duration of the spell and

so or like a one time so the blessed

spell lasts for a certain length of time

its concentration up to one minute so if

I concentrated right so for as long as

that lasts every time you roll a d20 for

an attack role or a saving throw you

also roll a d4 and add that to the end

to the result Oh tight okay which brings

us now so as soon as you cast that spell

you're all aware that pouring out of the

gatehouse on to the castle walls ninety

feet overhead are what look to be about

a dozen guards with crossbows you also

see another another eight soldiers pour

out past Katarina out of the mouth the

entrance of the castle and come at you

from behind it takes all of their

movement however to emerge and build

their weapons and to come out into the

courtyard so paltin evylyn and DF you've

got eight soldiers standing behind you

just emerged from the castle and another

twelve on the castle walls all loving in

the crossbows at you what are you doing

Stroud went that way

you also see what looks like a guard

captain

calling down from the battlements of the

keep above and behind you and shouting

orders to kill you all okay all right

guys are we just dead guard n-no we run

away it's the end of the show

no it's time to run it's time to run

away everyone DF oh you're up

great you see crossbow bolts level that

you swords drawn behind you Paulsen

enabler next to me in Strix is floating

above that's correct yes she's just like

going like this like eat lannisters

yelling things that strong like you can

still turn to the light you could still

be good bless your mortal soul as you're

looking at the big black horse getting

farther away in his big cave Ostrovsky

bellowing out behind him yeah yeah now

if so you said strawberry is there any

like kind of going yes he is heading out

to the courtyard toward the drawbridge

and there's no good way for me to reach

him right now you if you were to run

after him but cutting action - so right

now he is about 60 feet away from you so

- - and move you would be there so okay

I could do that but I would be going

through you'd be coming up behind him

essentially yeah but all the guards were

there yeah I'd be going like through

them basically are there on the walls

above okay so they would be shooting

down at you that's to crossbow bolts

sure is

now the one thing you well make an

intelligence check to you all right

porky so that's high enough to know

based on your martial experience that

with the fact that it's kind of windy

and they're 90 feet up and using these

heavy crossbows they're actually firing

at you from long range so they're a

disadvantage okay that's great no much I

just want to ruin straw I cannot under

good conscience just leave everyone else

behind after a singular purpose God's

evil cow chip will be fine so I guess

don't like turn alternative palton and

evylyn and almost signal that is

probably best for us to lay down our

arms yeah

so she'll heal she his blade okay and

then just make make no kind of

aggressive movements or anything kind of

put his hands up on it but like I'm just

shaking inside as striving on my job

just like really like that just that uh

yeah soap Alton's beside you and he goes

what are you doing man she could

probably it's true you can get invisible

and do other things he's can do all

kinds of things particularly with his

new instrument of the bards

I don't know what to do okay

decision paralysis don't you have

decision fatigue we're all dying every

day MDS life decision fatigue the story

of the waffle crews decision me up so I

think paltin now evil and you looked

actually pretty wounded right yeah we

all do he is going to strum a few lines

on his mandolin and cast here wounds on

you and I'm shocked

uh healing is like like a Disney

Princess like Cinderella turning into

the ballgown alright so he's going to

heal you feels amazing sixteen hit

points cool all right

Yuval in do you think you and Strix

could fly after Strada oh sure I think

she goes yes alright um let's see it is

now now that Paul is gone the guards

turn

so since DF you have she's through

weapon they will just attempt to

apprehend you that is to say they're

grappling you but not like punching you

in the ad or anything okay they're

seizing you they will attempt to do the

same thing to evil and evil and are you

attempting to resist yes okay in that

case they attack you of course you like

and why resist I mean oh no don't worry

we're not bad guys we're just here to

help

Wyatt you're like flying up they they

will give you a moment to sheath or drop

your weapon do you do either no they

will attack okay all right and palton

however now I'll just sort of stop

playing his mandolin and surrender just

like you know stop that was nice

alright guitar swings from yes next

rapid so evylyn okay so the first guy

rolls a 21 to hit second guy misses the

third guy rolls a 15 your armor class is

17 right yeah and you guys crit you of

course oh yeah also I I wasn't wearing

armor so I wasn't about to get shot

right combos that's true okay so

evylyn you take six points of damage

from the first sword swing out stop that

so clang-clang pudding and then you take

fifteen points of damage from the second

print i just got healed excuse me yeah

and as they're hitting your inanimate

body you don't so much as feel the blows

that are simply just sort of rocked by

them but you can see that that last one

cut pretty deep through the artificial

leathery skin and wood of your body into

your in

yeah I don't think I'm any better all

right and the crossbowmen up above will

also take aim at evylyn and Strix

all right now in the interest of

transparency because I know I was gonna

make a lot of rolls at disadvantage for

these guys I actually printed out a

sheet of paper with random dice rolls

from 1 to 20 that I'll just knock off as

I go I'm so glad you were ready for that

all right

so Strix a flurry of crossbow bolts get

launched in your direction ok um eight

of them to be exact

what's your armor class I clap I cast

mage armor earlier I'm pretty sure so

it's 14 alright so one hit I'm also in

the sky I'm sorry that was a miss three

missions for misses five mrs. six misses

seven misses haha

one hit alright

so only one of the bolts hits you Strix

and it does eight points of piercing

damage oh that's good I'm glad it wasn't

all of them because I'd be dead

alright and then there are more take

shots at evylyn they too have

disadvantage that's going to miss miss

miss and miss ah that's what I like to

hear

clatter clatter clatter crossbow will

shatter on the cobblestones around you

and coming out through the entrance

behind the soldiers are more soldiers

Jesus you see another four of them

emerged so now there are twelve on the

walls and twelve on the ground around

you

for heaven's sake and behind those

soldiers you see what appears to be a

priest of the morning Lord ah a poor

adult short man with

white hair blowing in the wind a trimmed

beard he's got red robes with gold trim

and he's carrying a seven-foot-tall

wooden staff capped with a golden symbol

of the morning Lord and he casts bless

on three of the guards attempting to

capture evil

hey a lot of look they understands upon

you friend hello all right

and he's you can hear the blessing of

the morning Lord fall upon these

soldiers

oh that's nomads all right let's see

next up is Strix

okay the guards on the wall reload the

crossbows so how many are there in total

how many guards 24 soldiers great twelve

on the ground up on the walls lovely

great yeah well for number one

she has peed herself and she's cool and

is bleeding and Janna stabbed and

there's I mean captured that's a I mean

we're back in time everything's bad so I

guess she's just gonna go after straw

because I've heard she heard DF say to

do it so this like should I do it

looking at did you see he's surrounded

by soldiers there's a lot of noise down

there now you're not even true are you

just like you rock it through the night

chasing after strawed who at that very

moment is crossing the drawbridge to the

gate houses on the far side of the chasm

that separates the castle from the main

mountain pass and he is obviously going

after the coach you know that you're

able to keep up with him on your broom

you're both going you and the horse are

going at the same pace strikes all right

is there any way it's okay so I've

caught up that uses all your action -

okay cool so I've caught up to him

you're you're caught up to him but

you're above him

how high above him would you like to be

real high Oh 90 feet 120 feet let's say

let's say a hundred feet high got it

okay and if I have to cast a spell it's

gonna be like ha all right is nosediver

spells

so waffles who looks very confused to

sort of picked up and grabbed by some

soldiers now you don't want to fight and

waffles is feeling a bit frisky at first

and then just kind of goes he's kind of

everything they're gonna hurt waffles it

doesn't look like they're hurting her

no all right and we come to Evelyn

Evelyn was like about cuz des was like

after Strad so she was like about to go

and then she saw waffles and she's like

[Music]

she kills it at Dieppe in palton and she

tries to shoot up after strong with

strength all right

you will provoke a tax of opportunity

from the four guards surrounding you if

you care yeah well can I lay on hands

and then leave actually if you do

nothing except disengage you can

actually do it without provoking

any action yeah all right up into the

air you shoot yeah and you can get up as

high as well you can go double your

speed so 60 feet up in the air that

still puts you within the courtyard

below the top of the walls but you're

well out of the range of the guards on

the floor on the ground all right

as you saw up into the air the priest of

the morning Lord just sort of looks up

at you from behind the wall of soldiers

supposedly under Blyth you surprise on

his face

and then DF you see paltin is fighting

with a soldier who's trying to take his

mandolin away but what do you do it's

your turn

well I'm pretty much apprehended at this

point you are I'm just surrounded by

guards right no one of them import these

so you don't have to make it check to

know that these aren't just normal

guards these are the veteran soldiers

from strods army who serve worms so they

don't look like they don't look like

phoebs these guys have fought many

battles and Wars ok yeah not what in

this plate but nearby there is this

priestess there is a priest an old

memories standing there with a staff

blessing the soldiers in the name of the

morning Lord the way he's dressed you

think he's probably like the priest of

the castle like the castle yeah its own

prea chaplain or whatever okay this is

the guy who probably would have done the

marriage or the wedding tomorrow

yep okay I can't really just waiting for

just waiting alright paltin we'll

eventually as pointy swords are thrust

that under his nose the he will release

his mandolin you said his his dead hand

his animated hand sort of crawled into

his backpack okay what about Simon Simon

you can't see in the crowd cuz the

guards had just sort of swarmed over him

paltin has strongly urged Simon not to

shoot anybody with darts unless he gives

the order to do so right

but dollar kidding I'll let you make a

perception shock evylyn ooh

awful DejaVu even bought strikes again

19 very good actually you can see as you

get up into the sky and look back toward

your friends that in the moment before

he lost his mandolin paltin was able to

get off one little strum of the mandolin

and it looks like he turned Simon

invisible oh nice

I don't know what little murder by are

you talking about never someone alright

so Strix you go barreling after straw in

the night you see him ride to the

mountains and along the mountain roads

and then he veers left at an

intersection and begins to head off make

a perception check from your altitude oh

okay oh wait sorry I get I'm blessed

hold on no you don't get that you don't

get that about the skill Jax I'm not I'm

I'm not blessed anyway so it's right

we're not that blessed there's just

enough light still left in the sky that

you can actually follow strawed and you

can certainly hear the clapping of the

hooves of the horse chasing at full-bore

but you don't see any sign of the

carriage up ahead okay so he's just he's

just going he's just motoring and he

does he see me he has not given you any

indication that he is alleged your

presence he has not acknowledged your

presence in any way that you can tell

alright um with your roll of seven right

is there any way that while I'm cruising

I could like read my drow book since

you're just keeping a level altitude and

not doing anything else you can probably

try to unpack the book now hold it down

and you know study just try to study a

spell cool I'm still gonna try and study

the black tentacles okay it looks very

arcane but give it an Arcana check for

me alright I know magic

no I don't I don't know magic at all

actually you thought today you think it

would take you longer than just a casual

read - I love the picture of her just

like frantically flipping through it

while she's trying to fly but as you're

reading suddenly a gust of wind tears

your witches hat off your head

yeah should I go get it sure okay

yeah you circled down and you sort of

fly it you do a flying circle down to

catch the Hat just make a dexterity

check to catch that maybe a dexterity

saving throw for me to throw you're

blessed for this you're blessed for this

one

okay 14 as you reach for the Hat you

kind of let go of the broom and then

suddenly realize that's a mistake and

you grab hold of the broom before it

escapes you oh good and managed to hang

on but the Hat continues to flutter down

by you I am i close enough behind her to

kept it oh no no no no I tried I think

that hat is gone perhaps gone I'm still

wearing it though all right and then

strawed books let me see if he notices

or I did any indication that you're

behind him okay

all right probably doesn't he's just

like this person it's not a threat these

soldiers

evylyn in the castle who are on the

walls take aim at you in the air since

you're the only one who hasn't been

apprehended and you're the only target

who's available to them they will all

unleash their crossbow bolts upon you

sweet

all right

and you are within short range of them

so it's gonna hurt no disadvantage so

let's see if I die here I blame paltin -

no one's dying here not today it's every

day we're all dead

alright five out of the 12 managed to

hit you

less than half guys this is gonna be I'm

telling you this is gonna be bad

I've made bad I'll just say it up I'll

just add up the damage I told you this

was a bad day you guys I knew it

so evylyn gets pierced five times and

takes 22 points of damage and plummets

from oh my gosh okay oh my god like a

limp robotic rag doll

alright yes so you hit the cobblestone

the cobblestone courtyard and we'll end

up taking an additional nine points of

damage and that will cost you one death

saving through

all right so DF and paltin both C and

evylyn get shot out of the sky and crash

down into the courtyard about 30 feet

away crit I would make a move to like go

help her no no he says you've got too

many guards grappling you there's you

have to you'd have to really you'd have

to escape there grapples you can do you

can attempt one of those now if you want

to slip through a slip free of one of

the grappling guards you could do that

now as an action how many how many have

grappled to me for oh so so to get free

I would need to make four grapple checks

desperately each one in action Wow okay

well the struggle will be there okay I

appreciated

yeah thanks we just turn off our

computers go straight ahead make any

time digits just like screaming no and

yelling like she needs help and just

trying to pull his way through okay as

you do that you can see that kind of

making his way through that the crowd of

guards surrounding you and the crown of

guards surrounding paltin is the priest

of the morning Lord he seems to be

heading over to evylyn well I think that

the most and then he will kneel down

beside her and you can see him touch her

and utter a prayer oh maybe he's nice

no he's not no one is nice and evylyn he

stabilizes you ah the light of Lysander

flows through my construct base in that

moment somehow the one guard who is

grabbing waffles gets bit on the arm and

Oh scampering over through the crowd to

evil inside oh my I'm not conscious

though right yeah but somewhere deep

inside I know and just sort of headbutts

evylyn Oh with its head and Strix so to

make a long story short we get another

shot to make a perception check alright

to find your hat if you care or you can

just leave the Hat behind oh no I'm

gonna leave the Hat behind I just tried

to like you don't need to make another

check you can just follow straw down the

road and you can see that the coach the

black coach pulled by the two horns with

Sergey and Tatiana has crossed over a

stone bridge that spans a bit of a gorge

near which is a giant raging falling

waterfall okay and strawed has written

has basically gotten onto the bridge and

is very close to catching up with them

so close that the driver of the coach is

now aware of the pursuit okay so the

bridge it's a big it's a sort of an

arching stone bridge with raised

sections on the side and it covers a

span in the it covers sort of a gorge in

the mountain through which the river and

waterfall cut all right okay all right

and yeah the waterfall pours into the

river that flows under the bridge and

that flows southeast toward the town of

the village of borough via there's a

long beyond the bridge is a long winding

mountain trail that cuts down into the

woods and he hasn't reached the bridge

yet the Strad has reached the bridge and

is on the bridge in this moment okay

all right can I Ram him you're a hundred

feet above him and you can go all out

and move 120 on your broom so if you

want to hurl yourself bodily at straud

you can't I I want to Ram him and also

use my hellish rebuke to knock him off

the bridge you can only use hellish

rebuke as a reaction to being it oh

that's right he did stab me should he

use that last week the but so just me

you want to trying to hit strong off his

horse or hit the horse I want to hit him

off the horse okay so I would like you

also like also while staying away from

him just like maybe just like using the

broom I don't know you bodily throw

yourself and basically come at him from

the side okay I'm just cool I'm gonna

I'm gonna do that and it with the whip

in mind that I'm going to miss you step

away okay

after you've struck him yes okay and

where do you intend to misty step - just

like a thirty feet out in space

somewhere back onto my broom if I can

oh so you're actually gonna leap off

your broom yes to hit him while riding

it yes

okay in that case since you're trying to

shove him this is a very difficult yes

maneuver but I'm coin since you're

trying to shove him make a strength

athletics check oh my god I can't

believe it

with your strength modifier what does

that actually end up being I mean I

don't have a strength modifier okay but

much to your surprise that is enough to

knock straud off his horse yeah after

you strike him and he goes tumbling on

to the mossy bridge and the horse just

sort of bolts ahead of him you instantly

misty step back onto your broom alright

so you are on your broom straw is lying

in a pile on the bridge and his horse

then sort of stops about thirty feet

ahead it comes to sort of a skidding

stop

first I'm gonna yell Pike off at him

that's what he deserves on his action

okay he will stand oh he took some

damage from that so roll to d6 for me

six tricks bodily damage four damage

he took some damage from that and he

will stand up having been slowed down he

will whistle for his horse and the horse

will come back to him of course and

let's see he stood up and he got his

horse back it's a movement probably no

action to the whistle and then he uses

an action to climb back on his horse and

he's done so you've basically slowed him

down yes now he knows I'm here now he

knows you're here

great alright slowed him down yeah what

would you like to do he is now back on

his horse on the bridge and kind of

turning it back in the direction he

wants to go he's not gonna listen to me

but I might as well try but tricks is

convinced because evil and is so

convinced that they can make things

better that she's just gonna just try

and exploit yell at him just say stop

for two seconds or you barmy vampire

piece of you're a vampire that's

how I want to convince someone just talk

to me I know about the dark powers I

know about them they're possessing you

alright um he'll totally listen normally

there would probably be a chance for him

to listen to you but since he watched

you burn the tapestry of his father

oh he just scowls

and rides off I can remake it okay

you see DF you can see a couple guards

at the priests command come over and

pick up evylyn who's pretty light and

just based on how she looks now you

don't think she's in any danger of dying

or anything like that

nice alright great

raha Dean re-emerges from the castle

with two more soldiers and is starting

to command the soldiers to get more

horses and see it seems intent to follow

their master but he also commands those

who are in custody of you to take your

weapons and stuff which they've already

done and then to hold you here

is he within earshot at least yes all

right well while he's doing all of the

shenanigans I'm just gonna shout at him

and in hopes of just any words actually

land within his conscious just saying

you said all you were to do was to keep

Sergey Tatiana alive and yet as long as

you let Stroud go you condemned them to

death

we know his secrets we know his desires

were only trying to help okay

raha Dean seems to ignore you and with a

gesture he summons over the priest who

that administers healing upon him and

you see some so much work on that this

is some raha Dean's wounds fade away he

still looks kind of hurt but you hear a

few bones snapping back into place we

are not your enemy yeah I could have

finished you when I had the chance when

you were trampled frozen and stabbed and

I chose not to because I knew what was

right he's not listening to us why do I

like fire so much you eat

bart's dr sari of Strix estrade resumes

what do you do oh yes of course I keep

following out I'm really mad at this

point like as he makes his way they

could both be carriage and straw kind of

disappear into the canopy of the thick

forest that covers the foothills of the

mountains and you lose sight of them

unless you go under the canopy and sort

of follow the Crown's of the trees fine

this sounds like fun like Star Wars yeah

yeah so you kind of wave down the road

following from behind you see straud Lee

from the back of his horse on to the top

of the carriage and I know that yes fur

is still there at least right use it

okay now I keep hearing speeder noises

for your broom in my hand all right

there goes tracer yes exactly and later

straw and yes burr seemed locked in

battle okay this is all very bad I don't

know what to do I already bodily hurled

myself at him can I just do I don't have

any I promise I don't know how many

sorcery points I have left but I think I

turned into a cloud too many times so

where I don't have any left you did like

three or four yeah so I can't cloud

which is the same slot as fireball I

used my one fancy spell kind of cold so

I do think oh no wait I how many times

did I alter myself though I don't think

I have that either

I do have poison spray so I'm just gonna

ride up and poison spray him in the face

alright you fly alongside okay what is

your poison spray look like where does

it come from I don't know like your

hands I guess maybe I just hold stinky

and he's the one that doesn't squeeze

him sort of farts out no I could do that

cool yeah normally what happens is you

sort of throw your hand out and the

puffs of noxious gas emerges from the

palm but you can just as easily have the

noxious gas come out of stinky that

makes perfect sense to d12 is what it is

Wow think he's got some real action

going on there alright Scott's gotta

make a constitution saving throw um he

did not roll particularly well so he's

gonna take all that it's okay it's only

11 damage I'm still good take my rat

fighting straw but it's very clear to

you that yes per a bard Mavis honey bard

the seasoned soldier and war master but

within the wagon within the as you're

flying alongside

this coach the velvet curtains part and

you can see Sergei look out at you and

he says something you're not exactly

sure what he says because there's a

great deal of noise as you're whisking

along and the battle is raging on top of

the coach but it appears to be some sort

of healing word and you get back 9 hit

points oh nice

great glad I can keep fighting or

whatever it is that I'm doing alright

strawed is going to attempt to shove yes

/ he succeeds and he's going to

deliberately shove him after you so okay

burned the horse for 17

and you cephalus the cephalus cuz they

contained within it and then you see its

main burst into flame and its moves

that your broom is a broom of animated

attack so if you ever wanted to you

horse could destroy the broom if you're

not careful no well we need the broom to

get away so I just want to I want to get

away from here really bad so I'm gonna

try and just like see if I can grab yes

/ to get on the broom with me you know

that it won't support two people

oh but if you given as you express your

disdain and indecision at this moment

yes person says don't worry about me go

protect yourself no yes yes / a feud I'm

pretty sure my friend paltin is gonna be

dead forever so you can't it's like a

time thing do I know that is that

possible you're asking him asking

herself loudly and also saying that to

him

great okay fine

this is like he pulls out a wineskin you

lost me great go okay well you know what

I'm just going to tell this is so bad

this is so bad okay I'm just gonna get

on the broom and be like okay well the

best thing I can do is give you the

spell book all right you know how to use

this right he takes it and he says it's

a book right read the spells you know it

does that it you need to stay alive

he'll he'll look at it and sort of flip

through it

here's that can I take it back from him

when you try he grabbed it

great great that's the straight so

Kompany that's just lost your book this

is perfect

who can I throw myself bodily at now

okay course I don't recommend it I don't

know what to do with the horse can i

mage hand and just slap the horse sure

won't do anything but yeah can I

distract him yes and yes bird will take

advantage of the distraction to kind of

withdraw into the woods

oh good oh thank God but made shams just

gonna slap the courts around right horse

the horse will turn on you and attempt

to come on my broom I'm on my broom I'm

believing so you cast the spell and then

yeah yeah as it slaps him and then I'm

just gonna go up in the air okay

d/f um so it looks like everybody's been

apprehended but nobody is any imminent

danger of dying rah rah Hadean has

received some healing magic from the

priests some horses are being brought

out from stables this takes a number of

minutes and it looks like raha Dene is

able enough to ride but rather than take

take the horses he casts a spell and

conjures a phantom steed for himself

mounts that he four of the soldiers are

mounting up on horses to accompany him

I'll just keep yelling that and my guess

okay

he is absolutely ignoring him you know

if I say something along the lines of

if you believe any fragment of truth in

what I say I can give you all the

answers and more

the truth is straat what happens to

Poirot via what we heard to prevent I

only ask your time and your faith make a

perception oh my god persuasion jack

Wade person I have paulten help you help

him you have balls and give big bar dice

not terrible 18 ok as he is preparing to

ride off he does stop for a moment

something you said seems to have got his

attention and he doesn't say anything he

just stares penetratingly at you like

here's your moment tell me right I still

apprehended yes so I was like and he's

up on his phantom horse now so he's kind

of looking down on you yeah it's like in

my pack you'll find a book a book lock

like I'll be open by a few people one is

strong then there is myself through the

ring of keys around my waist inside it

you'll find everything that happens to

burrow via every nest rod does for

hundreds of years to come what he

becomes if you know straw as well as

anyone else you can recognize the

handwriting is none other than his

alright he tells a soldier to rifle

through your stuff and find this book

alright Strix you're back up in the air

out of the reach of the devil horse

thing the carriage has stopped great

stride has torn

open one of the doors just flung it open

to look at the bride and groom who tried

to run away from him what is he doing he

is reaching into the coach and pulling

his brother out onto the ground

Oh God okay uh-hmm

this is not the way to win back your

girl stride can I put my mage hand in

his face just like yeah you can

basically fly overhead cast your spell

and have the mage hand in his face great

that's what I'm gonna do my book is gone

stupid Paul Tintin look I'm just gonna

throw my drift globe at him literally

take everything out of my robes and

throwing about him

alright there's a heart as you throw the

heart at him it goes plop onto the

ground next to Sergei and the drift

globe is lying there and just sort of

slowly goes dark everything's broken

Straub we'll take the short sword from

his in his on the throne can I Ram him

again

well you just took like three actions so

and he will take it and rather than hurt

his brother with it he will throw it at

you ah okay

all right he wrote that 26 to hit of

course actually I guess they're all

disadvantaged he still hits with a 23

all right so you're hit by this blade

and there is necrotic energy that

courses through cool when it hits you it

does

seven points of damage normally great

yeah good job I did and you kind of

saved Sergey I think yeah I did it it

appears I don't think I did anything

right and then so seven and then another

22 for a total of 29 points cool I have

one point left so the sword impales you

just like holding it like sticking and

chest moving on to the broom you've

thrown pretty much everything else you

have at his head at his feet Strix does

not want this monster to stay alive

what would you like we're not even there

if your one hit point do what Church

does best I mean she's definitely gonna

run away but before she does she's gonna

say just you're possessed by dark powers

and I was trying to save your brother

you're gonna kill him one day and you're

gonna regret it and she'll fly away

alright did she get persuasion nope she

burned the tapestry depicting his father

in front of his face there is no nothing

in strods mind will ever redeem her or

me worth listening to I just

didn't I needed a distraction it didn't

matter which one of us alright

so Strix is gone and back at the castle

Rawdon will have the book handed to him

and he will age through it and then he

seeing that it is an item of some

interest

he'll dart you one more sort of

thoughtful glance like hi you actually

might be the real deal

and then he will dispel the phantom

steed he will order the guards to stand

ready but not leave yet and he takes the

book and withdraws into the castle

you're not sure why great and then

there's sort of an awkward period where

you're out in the courtyard the rain

begins to fall not heavily just like and

you're standing out there with all these

soldiers and slowly just getting wet

waiting to see what happens next

am I still like grabbed yeah yeah and

same thing with paltin and evylyn is

lying there I've just sort of on the

ground yeah nothing no all right

constricts fly around to try and find in

some of the landmarks she remembers from

Peru via sure like if what are you

looking for specifically there's the

village of burrow via which you can

actually see because there are lights

down there right and then everything

else is sort of cast under the pall of

night so the mountains are quite dark

and looming you know that if you were to

follow the mountain trail past the

castle sort of deeper in the mountains

you'll eventually get to like the

windmill and then nowhere van Rycke

didn't would be and beyond that the the

town of a Lockheed

right your emotional support dog

well I'm guessing I'm not going back to

that castle because everyone is trapped

so I'm just gonna try and make my way

down to borough via Milwaukee has a bad

taste in my mouth so I'm just gonna go

go into the town and see if I can find a

healer okay so you head down into the

town D F I'm assume you're just going to

wait to either for a Hadean to return or

what-have-you yeah

anything else would be suicidal okay in

that case about an hour later of waiting

in the rain in the darkened courtyard

you hear the coach come back across the

drawbridge and two horses pulling it and

they come to a stop near the mass of

soldiers and not too far away from you

about 30 feet away from you and paltin

and you can see the figure at the reins

is straud and the soldiers come to the

carriage and open up the door and under

his command pull Tatiana and Sergei out

from within and both bride and groom are

alive for now yes

and strawed orders the guards to see

them safely into the castle and away

from the assassins and both Sergey and

Tatiana kind of have defeated looks on

their faces as they are assured past you

and Politan toward the castle I'm still

gonna shout out to keep them away from

leo

dallisa de Luz Nia they're just like

yeah

just to keep him away from leo he's

waiting to strike

Sergei and Tatiana keep him away okay

the priest will come over to straud and

administer healing a prayer of the

morning Lord upon him and strawed is

looking much better seems good I like

those morning Lord prayers yeah stronger

right people Strad we'll have the coach

taken away he'll have you and palton and

evylyn held where you are he commands he

commands an update on captain tool is

Nia and is told by one of his

lieutenants that the captain has been

taken into custody and so has his mother

and strawed orders them brought out to

the Courtyard immediately oh yeah we

should have a chat all right about five

minutes later you see the guard captain

Leo delays Nia his weapons stripped away

most of his armor gone except a few

pieces of it being dragged out his

mother this large kind of heavyset woman

being dragged out behind him and she is

screaming and wailing into the rainy

night and strawed has Leo delays Nia

thrown down on his knees before him and

asks one of the guards for a sword and

says

you will never see the light of the

morning Lord again and he decapitate s--

leo ah in front of his mother and then

he turns to the guards and says about

her put her in the crypts

and she is dragged off whaling to be

basically locked in the dungeons alive

for all time Viki papi bye Felicia I

heard that once and then he said he

orders the assassins brought forth and

paltin is the first to be hauled to him

don't say anything stupid yeah so two

guards basically take bright paltin over

to where Leo's decapitated body is

spilling out on to the cobblestones and

he has pushed down to his knees and

straddle will lift the sword No and

decapitate him DF you are brought over

to where Paul Tain's decapitated body

and Leo's decapitated body is this isn't

real though I thought you said he cut

off Paulson's head but that's not what

you actually said right oh that's what

he said yeah DF you can see walton's

severed and head kind of looking up at

you on the ground as you are forced to

down to your knees I told Nathan evylyn

would look after balton strong raises

his sword

raha dean has not emerged from the

council yet I'm still unconscious right

you are it's just I just I just tears

throwing up in DF because it realizes at

this point he's let every single one of

them down alright so as the tears

combine with the rain that pours and

streaks down Dee's face you can just

feel that heavy sword come up over

strods head and then the next thing you

feel DF is eternal night strikes that's

not my name why am I here so my friends

are dead did I make it to an end so yes

you did you make it to the blood of the

vine in where you see there are drunken

Peruvians everywhere chatting quietly

drinking up there is sort of a roar of

thunder over your head a big loud rumble

that seems to go on forever feeling a

little bit more familiar a little bit

yes hmm great

is there any way anyone that looks like

they could heal me at all no but they do

they do suggest you could go to the

local church all right

and they should be able to help you

there can I stumble there I have one hit

point so I won't be stumbling yes you

look pretty bad actually

yeah maybe a couple Peruvians can be

goaded into helping you get there right

thanks all right so yes they take you up

to the church which looks in finer shape

than it did when last you were here and

a local priest will take you in and

administer some modicum of healing now

over the course of days Strix you learn

about what has transpired in the castle

oh so you learn that the Duchess was

sentenced that a guard captain was put

to death the assassins that the Duchess

hired were killed so I found out they

were dead yes and what would be Strix is

reaction over time to the fact that she

knows she's lost the other members of

the waffle crew it is also in the days

ahead she knows that the mists of

Ravenloft have sprung up that the blood

sacrifice that straw it had to make to

secure his realm has been made and

there's rumors that strawed was so

enraged that he sort of locked himself

away in his castle and a bunch of people

up there there was some sort of huge

revolt possibly led by his Chamberlain

you don't know but what's happened is

the castle basically locked up and all

that burrow viens know is horrible

rumors of death upon all who enter I

don't know it just give up I guess yeah

without her friends she would just give

up and she would just probably like find

a hut or something in the woods and just

live there alright so yes over time you

were able to make your way into sort of

the swamplands and near near a river

near the Luna River and kind of make a

hot I don't like thinking about those

makes me really sad after after about a

month

you are surprised when your Hut receives

its first visitors that being Simon

riding on the back of waffles Oh

Oh she'll just like get down on our

knees and just start crying and hugging

mom even Simon who she really doesn't

like yeah unfortunately neither of them

can tell you the escapades that led them

from the castle during the chaos of the

the bloody murders and what not nor can

they tell you exactly what fate became

your friends it is something it is then

years pass waffles waffles gets bigger

becomes a full-grown al bear in a matter

of years romping around protecting your

hut from predators then it suddenly

dawns on you that your your hut is being

sort of not threatened but there are

creatures like living scarecrows that

have been sighted around and as you

begin to poke and prod and you're not

exactly sure where they're coming from

but not long thereafter you receive your

second or guess third visitor you

definitely know know what those things

are though they are animated scarecrows

yes they look threatening and they have

big rusty blades for claws but you don't

know where they're coming from or who's

sending them and it looks like they're

spying on you and not long thereafter

you get a visit from avestan a boy who

calls himself Stan Amir what's the

interest make a intelligence check

that's weird

oh I got a oh that's pretty good

19 you remember an old man named Stan

Amir who you met at the start of this

campaign who was living with the he was

avestan II and he showed you in some

green fire an image of straw on a black

horse Oh

oh yeah at the very beginning of the

campaign before you even entered burrow

via he was the best on the old of Astana

who sort of led you into the realm him

and

people this kid you can't see if he's

too young to bear any resemblance to the

old man he'll become but the name

similarity strikes you hmm

I guess I'll welcome him in and offer

him pastries okay

real pastries not poison ones your

generosity is richly rewarded when he

invites you one day to come and visit

his people who are camped nearby I'm not

really had a lot of good experiences

with those people or with pretty much

anything in the past over many years now

Strix has been alone and talking to only

an owl bear so I guess still agree but

reluctantly because her social skills

are not up to par they weren't good in

the first place and now they're worse

all right

one of the people that you meet in the

Visconti is stan Amir's mother and a

woman named Jana who's very sort of

friendly and accommodating with you

despite your sort of freakish appearance

by her standards anyway

and she sort of helps you get things

that you need that you can't really find

anywhere else including wine and other

things that you can take back to your

Hut and your I need a lot of wine can

you tell - you're more than welcome to

stay with her at any time and she

introduces you to a group of dusky elves

who live in the woods of burrow via one

of whom you recognize as Casimir

belicoff dusk elf who when you last met

him actually had his ears chopped off

but his ears are not chopped off now

they seem to be fine and he is also very

gracious with you and so you kind of

developed this friendship among the dusk

elves and the Bustani who live in Peru

via and you hear tales of the mad devil

straw who lives in the castle by himself

I warned the dusk elves about raha Dean

yeah they they are aware of a dusk elf

named raha Dean who went to serve

estrade in his army but they have not

seen eye

hair of him in ages great alright and

one day while you're at your Hut having

left your desk health and Bustani

friends for a little while you're

probably expecting a visit from standing

me or any day now

and you're out picking herbs and other

poisonous substances I have a cauldron

till you see one of those scarecrows

kind of marching through the woods not

aware of you but sort of headed off in a

direction and you follow it in or the

swamp and when you do for the first time

even though you've been in the swamp

many many times you never saw it here

before but there's another hut a bigger

all yours and it's it's sitting on the

ground but it's got sort of roots

growing into it like it was made out of

a giant dead hollowed-out tree now I

spent some of my childhood in a hut yes

you spent your some of your childhood in

a hut with chicken feet yes yeah so is

this remind me of that it does have a

resemblance to that yes there's sort of

a soft light spilling out through the

doorway but you're not sure if it's

occupied or not all right well I will I

guess I'll walk up and knock on the door

have I gotten any better at casting

spells and this time too because I sure

hope I have so you haven't been

adventuring I don't get technically any

better right

maybe alchemically better yeah it's

possible that you you might have learned

a new spell two of your level okay

things like that and you would have

learned some things about burrow via pom

flora and fauna that you didn't know

before cool all right but you've been

off the beaten track when you and and

waffles approached the hut and you look

inside you see it's full of

paraphernalia all kinds of things that

the owner of this Hut has collected over

time in fact right there's while you

have a fairly substantial collection

yourself this is actually quite

unbelievable the amount of stuff that's

in there but dominating in the center of

the room you see a bath

Hubb an old clawfoot bathtub made of

iron that I guess she or he took and

just sort of put in the middle of the

room and as you approach you see it's

full of blood Oh Strix feels like a

bunch of joy at seeing all the like cool

paraphernalia probably the first time

she's felt joy mm-hmm in a very very

long time since she's met waffles and

Simon but as soon as she sees the

bathtub of blood she's just like oh but

can I do can i Arcana check here because

I would like to explore I got to so I

don't know as you approach hands come up

out of the blood and then this figure

sits up as though we're underneath the

the blood in the tub and with blood

coursing down it's had face and

shoulders you see it appears to be an

old woman and she's just red like

crimson going to the back of the room

not leaving just waiting for her to

finish whatever that is all right she

tell so you see her climb out of the tub

caked in blood

can I offer her a pie sure when you hand

her a pie she'll take it and devour it

right in front of you and there's

something about the way that she sort of

inhales this pie that suggests this is

no mere human you're dealing with even

though she looks like an old crone you

think she's probably some sort of

powerful witch or hag definitely

something I'm I've seen before and

definitely not going to run because she

was follow me so yep she tells you her

name is bobble eye saga named over time

you get to know her she takes some goat

blood baths with a few other pink stirs

and things mixed in to basically stop

her aging process and she teaches you

how to do it oh that's disgusting

but I don't want to die she says you'll

need it

um and you you realize that hey you both

have stones of good or she has a stone

of good luck on her it's like a little

cat headstone that she wears on a string

around her neck

you recognize that as a magic item that

she carries around and it used to belong

to Deb so strict will just start crying

exactly yes

and when she when you start crying in

front of her she asks you what you're

crying about Church like she can't even

talk first let her cry for a while like

just on the ground probably like a

couple of hours good hours like

dehydration hours like she won't be able

to talk when she stands up so she's just

like asking for water and I'm sure

she'll get a bucket of goat blood to

wait for that one yeah so as soon as

she's drank the goat blood she'll just

like explain what happened and how she

she had a family and that they were well

they were like her family but they were

her friends and that that they're gone

because straud beheaded them she will

tell you that she was strods midwife

she actually bore straw into the world

that's very upsetting yeah so strix was

look right at her be like so is it your

fault that he's evil Oh probably you

didn't have to be evil

we tried to fix it

fix it you can't fix it we went back in

time there's nothing to fix he's perfect

and that's kind of where your

relationship with her account ends and

you sort of agree mutually agree never

to really share a space again thanks for

the goat bath yeah which was fine

because she was flying around on a giant

skull and yellow skulls cool but yeah

but your friendship with the Bustani and

the dusk else pays dividends over the

years and they introduce you to some

surviving while wouldn't say surviving

some undead revenant who live in the

mountains of Raven locked in a ruin

called Argan vast halt where they've

been holed up straud tried to wipe them

out but a few of them survived and one

of them sir Godfrey Willem says there is

a place called the amber temple Oh

ancient lore and dark gifts and given

the friendship that you've established

with the Bustani and the dusk elves he's

convinced them to mount an expedition

there and unearth lore needed to bring

your friends back from the dead that's

not going to work and sir Godfrey says

the Knights of the Silver Dragon have

guarded the amber temple against evil

incursions to make sure that it's it's

dark lure remains contained and safe but

Casimir of the dusk elves and Jana

Legrand of the mastani are very

insistent that they want to help you so

the question is would you like your

friends your current friends to venture

into the amber temple learn the secrets

of resurrection and use that to bring

your old friends back

they will do it for you yes all right

d/f you awake inside a rotted out coffin

lying in sort of a foggy Cemetery you

sort of sit up pull yourself up out of

the coffin you can barely move at first

like you're stiff and your bones have a

hard time moving and you can feel your

flesh which was sort of sunken

desiccated and shriveled to nothingness

just sort of filling out and fleshing

out and you look at your hand and flesh

that was clinging gray flesh that was

clinging to your bones suddenly sort of

fills out you feel blood coursing

through your body again standing around

you Arvest ani including an old woman

Bustani and a number of younger Bustani

there are dusk else including run you

recognize as Casimir who has an age

today since the last time you saw him

and a what appears to be undead knight

in armor wearing a crest plate with the

symbol of the morning Lord on it

his eyes sunken with little red

pinpoints of light in them his hair

mostly fallen out till there only a few

wisps left and he smiles this horrible

rictus skeletal grin as you come back to

life and then standing near him you see

Strix looking slightly older than you

must remember her but neatly preserved

by goats blood everything's fine and an

old and an old very large al bear

am i able to can I move like toys yeah I

have like the strength to even get up

yeah you you find the strength in your

body to move alright so and you can see

that as you look to your side

Paul ttan is already alive again and

just sort of like staring around had

everything so not even not even words

can escape from from D F it's just

whatever awkward stumbling move it

whatever strikes you can actually even

mustard like get himself out of whatever

a coffin and just kind of stumbles

forward straight to Strix and just

embraces her immediately Strix hopefully

will learn how to hug better after all

that time social return the hug

so Strix it's been about let's see it's

been about 50 years since you saw your

friends wow that's crazy yeah she's

definitely crying for sure alright Strix

has got a new witch hats well it is new

new by it's a different hat she's had

plenty of time to make a new one a new

rush this is like improved her outfit a

little bit her old robes literally fell

apart years ago after she fell into a

river and now she's sort of updated them

since yeah so DF is just like holding on

to it as tightly as possible and like I

will never let go again and all you can

just all he says is just through tears

just I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry don't

be sorry you're alive now it's fine

everything's fine alright everything's

fine and they cast the final spell on

Evelyn on her sort of construct remains

that were just sort of buried in the

dirt with them and since this is a

resurrection

need to check something here so glad

waffles is a killing machine that does

not change type so yes

evylyn light comes into your body the

light of the morning Lord washes into

your form

you've been at rest for some time and

you spring to life still a construct but

fully restored and covered with grave

dirt I think she wakes up screaming okay

yes idea of what happened so you guys

have been trapped in the ethereal plane

wandering in the borders of Ravenloft

for ages drifting in the gray mist

separated from your gods any you know

escaped to the afterlife as you are born

back to your bodies to escape that grey

nothingness is a huge relief for 50

years we've been wandering in

nothingness it seems like a long time

you can't you don't you can't you don't

can't you can't register how long you

were trapped there because it's the

ethereal is kind of a timeless place but

you felt you were there a long time

waiting for someone to find you

but yes evylyn you have been quite

you've been sent you felt separated from

the morning Lord for those fifty years

so I've been in like near eternal

aloneness yeah better than burrow via

alone less right and that the undead

night will sort of loom over you evylyn

and welcomed you back into the world and

he tells you his name is Godfrey Willem

he is a knight of the order of the

silver dragon and a servant of the

morning Lord

even's just kind of like slowly looking

around like really shaken really

uncertain what's happening yeah when you

look around you're at the intersection

where DF saw the spectral image of

himself being hanged from a gallows on

the corner there was sort of an

anonymous small disheveled graveyard off

to one side of the intersection full of

anonymous graves and you guys were

basically committed to those oh so we

just want by our own dead bodies from

the beginning yeah that's great all

prestidigitation the grave dust off of

her so that she doesn't your sparkly

clean Dave wood even looks down at the

compartment that she opens and keeps

juniper in oh no see the bones of a

small little mouse and streaks you know

that stinky passed away many many years

ago yeah of course

you know he died fat and happy yeah and

angry and angry yep you're alive

evylyn doesn't even say anything she

just like like that dude in a trance she

just kind of like takes the bones and

just kind of holds them out to strix

[Laughter]

she'll take them just wordlessly and

then pull her into a hog it's just like

an awkward hug shocked wide-eyed face

like completely completely shaken like

if she could be gray face she would one

of the one of the fellow Knights of the

order also this undead guy with sort of

rotting flesh and whatnot comes over to

you

and just sort of puts a hand on your

shoulder sue then tries to be soothing

but you can't he didn't and he pulls it

off didn't mean to startle you

and then one of the dusk else stands

luck to you looks at the dead rodent

bones and says would you like us to

resurrect that as well all right he will

cast the using the dark gift of zidon

the corpse star that he learned from the

amber temple this emaciated dusk elf

will reach down and cast on the bones of

juniper a resurrection spell and juniper

is alive okay

all of these dusk elfs are happening or

who are helping you cast these spells

you can see that they're all sort of

sort of ghoul like and withered like

they paid the price d/f paid to learn

the lore of the amber temple to cast

this magic but once you're all bought

back Casimir he'll say very calmly thank

you for everything you tried to do and

you have made this a less dark place

your friend paltin is avestan II he can

see you safely from this domain and the

vez tani old woman will sort of step

aside and reveal this vardø wagon pulled

by a big horse and she says this is

yours to see you safely from the domain

it was mine i bequeath it unto you

a gift from the Bustani a balloons just

kind of clinging to strips his cloak and

she keeps squinting at Strix because

Strix like doesn't look that much older

but looks different and even can't

figure out why that might have happened

and she's her brain it's like not

letting her process that so she's just

kind of clinging it just stares at

starts tricks is gonna be like it's

probably because I've been bathing in

goat's blood

well I Strix kind of feels bad leaving

cuz she's been here for so long like

what else is there right what do you

mean we made this a less dark place the

vasana say that

she will say come back and visit us

sometime I will tell you all about it

great so we can come whenever we want

paltin correct sure glad to have you

back the the Bustani will hand the keys

to the wagon door to paltin are re some

reason like missing all of our

belongings yes ah well with the

exception of whatever clothes you were

buried in or perhaps our ring yes

chances are you would probably still

have the ring they wouldn't take your

jewelry off unless it was around your

neck because your head was cut off DF

what about his cursed sword what about

if a ring was like in a pocket somewhere

it would still be in your pocket they

only took heavy equipment

cumbersome armor or evil ones family

ring is still and but the Hasani will

tell you to take comfort they were able

to salvage our belongings from the

castle oh good and they will open up the

Paulton can open up the back door and

see that the Bardo is stuffed full of

all your stuff as well as two big casks

of wizards of wine wine yeah we need at

least three more of those yeah there's

only five more is there anybody needs me

I'll be in here palton of course is

happy to see that Simon has survived the

passing of years instructs his company

unscathed Strix did give him a hat oh ok

a hat a witch hat

Simon's going to which hat

Simon and I are friend yeah the big al

bear sort of comes up to you and kind of

bangs you with its head in a friendly

way you see it's definitely waffles but

it's much older much wiser waffles and

big she is huge everyone just kind of

like reaches out like touches her head

as if to figure out if this is real

looks at Strix

yeah how how old is she strikes later

yeah she's almost 50 no she's a killing

machine strips you probably have time to

like draw like a picture book of waffles

baby book waffles will sort of plop down

and look over you even like while you're

flipping through the pages evil ins like

like and she keeps showing ona waffles

like the drives are like kind of messed

up because Trix did them so they're like

there's like one of just heard like

devouring like a rabid and ultimately I

think once she finishes with that book

she just kind of like she was kind of

like flops on waffles and she's like can

she ride well yes yes absolutely she

just crawls up on waffles back and kind

of nuzzles into her fur and just

completely circus he's always happy that

everyone she's just like smiling like so

good to have everyone back an older

wiser Stan Amir

now sort of a young adult kind of looks

sniffs the air and says it is probably

best if you go be with your friends

again your real friends this is the kid

that you watched grow up right right oh

so you you're my friend too we can have

more than one set of friends and Strix

will give my hog oh maybe I'll bring you

back here in what 30 years depth only if

you ask first all right

yes dad Amir will hug you and you here

from inside the wagon who's driving this

thing

[Laughter]

yeah Strix we'll get up to the top she's

probably had a lot of experience driving

wagons at this point yeah yeah so you

climb up onto the reins death will curl

up on the inside carriage all right

paulten is there with you no he's

pouring a big cask of stuff into his

wine skin to fill that up Simon will

climb into the back and just sort of sit

across from you Diaz and give you a

thumbs up

what does he has when he's been with

strips all these 50 years has he changed

in temperament at all that Strix have

you made any effort oh yeah Simon in any

way shape or form what do you mean he

was the only friend that she had so if

she definitely probably was using him as

like an alchemy like assistant like to

help her grind grind herbs and make

potions and he's learned to be quite

helpful did you ever speak to him about

DF oh yeah she would have just

constantly talked to him okay like

constantly all right so the point where

you probably sleep darted her a couple

of times all right she's like okay I

deserve that yeah she wakes up and she's

like wow that was really weird gosh I

sure miss my friends

one time that evil and yelled about the

morning Lord so sir godfrey Willem who

feels like he still owes you one

evylyn says if you would like I can

accompany you why in case you feel you

want protection

I look at Strix do we want / - yes

yes yes yes okay okay yes yes thank you

he's good

Lysander can't you feel it alright you

see him mount on his on a skeletal horse

and he'll trot ahead of the wagon

leading the way with the wagon following

Strix at the reins and waffles with

evylyn on its back but following close

behind even just clings to her like an

emotional support animal as you approach

the the mists that surround morovia they

parked before you they sort of billow

away creating a passage for you to

follow just like part three hope this is

the last one into the mists and out of

burrow via the waffle crew leaves the

dark land behind way more messed up and

then they got there the second time but

do they well there's nothing left to

bring you back forcibly because you

destroyed strods shadow yeah Oh connect

there's no connection left behind

question yes

what about Isaac did Strix like stop

that business you never ran into him you

probably stayed the hell away from

Valachi you're not even sure if Isaac

ever you know was there she was just not

curious she's like map I'm good yeah is

it possible that the fact that you were

never in voluntee Valachi meant maybe he

was never in milwaukee interesting so

it's possible you sort of cut that line

loose interesting yeah but he could

still be eleanor i don't think you would

have another mind

hunting around for him probably no but

you see you heard no sign of him heard

nothing no mention of his name nothing

but if he was summoned which it seemed

he was then that means he could still be

out there he could yes don't like that

just keeping that open so to know it'll

look behind behind my back all right

and as you emerge from the mists again

you are greeted with the cold blast of

winter air and you find yourself writing

the wagon into a blizzard and that's

where we'll pick up next week oh they

were heroes everyone and by heroes I

mean we're not heroes at all we just

survived every time we did the place

last dark kind that's a good thing yeah

it's tricks now the adult in the party

we were all dead for 50 years so to

separate our God and friends yeah

probably like you don't have to like

bathe in goats blood anymore but keep in

mind that you might yeah you kind of get

used to it after a while yeah plus he

can live forever I mean he's cool yeah

it doesn't mean to be a recipe for

preserving your natural youth mmm it's

good

yep how many years old the did she

appear like what's her equivalent age

now um she doesn't appear that much

older than when you last saw her because

she ba ba ba ba Lasogga taught her that

trick but she has got another fifty

years or so on her also live longer yes

they do and they don't necessarily

reflect their age quite so much her

horns might be longer

a little bit justice if I don't look too

terribly different no no did you get

different robes

yeah she's changed her apparel slightly

yeah yeah her broom probably looks a

little ratty or cuz it's been used to

run away from everything

sweet things and run away from things

and to attack things and stuff like my

loss like burn marks on from little

mishaps yeah yeah yeah yeah all right oh

man well that was fun I'm gonna go cry

in a corner now I always just planning

on killing straw just having a nice old

time my expected as I kill straw we are

heroes should've known better

killing straw is no easy task in the

best of situations but hey we did it the

first time you're right I will always

remember bodily throwing myself at him

yes was a defining moment for strix yeah

sure that's how she became an adult was

bodily throwing herself at him mm-hmm

that is facing some serious fear there

well guys that was fun all right so next
