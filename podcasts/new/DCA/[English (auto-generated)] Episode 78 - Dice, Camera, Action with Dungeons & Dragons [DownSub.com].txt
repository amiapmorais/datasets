hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action and the waffle crew all right

before we get the show on the road

and it's got some show-and-tell yes I'm

so excited I was trying to pull up

twitch chat before I showed but you guys

will just have to tell me what they say

so Auburn Elvis aw aw burn Elvis on

twitter has been hinting that he had

something to send me and it arrived hold

on hold on I want to show you first this

is all 3d printed all of the armor and

her like metallic golden hair and she's

got the shards of light fall and tree

beam and way more Coughlin's than his

cannon she's on a dice camera action

logo base it's the symbol of the morning

Lord but he had instructions that were

like turn it on on the bottom and then

squeeze the hand it's done like 20 and

it has yet to say the same thing the

genius of the waffle fam is boundless

yes I didn't realize you had so many

sayings I didn't either I I feel honored

that I have said that many things that I

guess what Barry Weiss all right let's

jump into this hot

we call this we called the MD when last

we left the waffle crew they had gotten

back the ring of winter having slain the

frost giant s and driven off the dragon

Klaus back on Paul Tain's hand where it

rightfully belongs heck yeah all right

yeah and the party befriended an elf

druid named Miranda who has an army of

veggies under her command they seemed to

worship the ground that she trod upon

and dragon bait also found when he went

off to relieve himself in the jungle a

baby Triceratops which is now following

the party around because the group

needed another animal companion uh-huh

all right so the now large and in charge

waffle crew decides to follow Miranda's

advice and enter the wanti dungeon

complex under the palace of omou through

a secret passage that her vegetabies had

detected and that led you into a chamber

where you met this weird kind of scrawny

you want tea who was making all these

super poisons and a scene of good-cop

bad-cop played out with DF Alton that

ultimately ended in the you auntie's

demise and from that room you went

deeper into the stronghold and found

yourself in a temple deep deep inside a

temple that has a raised platform built

on top of some serpent carvings looking

down upon a giant basin into which blood

is trickling and off to the sides off to

one side is a set of double doors that

caught DSi and off to the other side was

a giant bronze Gong that caught paltin

zai what called what caught evil ins I

was a horrific giant carving of dendara

the night serpent coiling up around the

ceiling of this vaulted chamber glaring

down upon you

and what cots tricks is I of course was

the coagulating blood in the basin and

Miranda zipped up to the top of the

balcony because something there caught

her eye which appeared to be some sort

of glyph inscribed platform in an AAA

alcove which turned out to be a

teleportation pad of some kind and as a

creature came off of the pad to confront

her a serpentine you want to wrapped in

bandages suddenly more snakes started to

pour out of the walls of the temple and

begin to surround you and that's when

evylyn unleashed her Moonbeam spell and

blasted a couple of them forcing them

back into their true you want Eve forms

yeah yeah and we kind of left we kind of

left on that note with lots and lots of

things going on so currently all the

waffle crew are in the temple room with

Miranda dragon bait and the veggie pygmy

army and waffles and 18 the Triceratops

and all the others haven't really fully

entered yet when all these snakes start

to come out and wreak havoc and it is do

oops my bad you know what I'm gonna have

you guys roll initiative again because I

Kramer which of these which it is which

is an official accounts is the right one

and so let us roll this shouldve to kick

off this session that's good okay

remember mine being 1919 all right 2013

13 for palton yep still bad nine nice

all right

want to swap with me so it's gonna be

Miranda at the top Strix evil in which

of you wants to technically go before

the other

yeah acting up simultaneously but

strikes and over stories age before

beauty you know and then it's true and

then do alright so here we go

Miranda you were on the balcony 20 feet

off the floor of the main temple staring

down this you want tea with a fiery

sword and he is all sort of wrapped up

in bandages

looks like he's some of his skin has

rotted and peeled away like he's got

some sort of form of leprosy but he

stares at you from between the slats in

his bandages you can see serpentine eyes

yellow slitted eyes almost looking

through you into the depths of your soul

what would you like to do ah well here's

the thing he told me to trust him but

gonna look him in the face and go I

don't know these people

at all and I don't know if I trust them

but I do know that I don't trust use I'm

gonna cast thunder wave alright like

just a great thing oh alright there is a

boom sound and thunderous energy washes

across rosin DC rippling his flesh and

he has to make a saving throw doesn't

look like he's gonna take the full brunt

of it okeydoke aye he's gonna take half

of 11 then he's gonna take all of it oh

he oh he failed yeah he failed perfect

well he's gonna take some 11 points Oh

damage yes okay Maj and be pushed 10

feet away can I push him back towards

the circle that he came through yes and

when you push him back into the alcove

there is another little flash of light

from the disk and he disappears so you

blast him back and he's gone Oh nobody

wanted that sword alright um can I bonus

action hidden path and vamps down to

where everyone else is yes so they're

kind of spread out Strix is right below

you by the basin paltin is off to your

right on the ledge with the Gong DF is

down toward your left by a set of double

doors and evylyn is up above flapping

her little winged boots oh go down by

strikes okay

you appear next to the basin yeah so you

this elf seems I have no trouble getting

around with her mystical juridic powers

Strix what do you do as you see these 30

odd snakes that have crawled over the

walls and they're all of there all

around the perimeter of the room so

they're kind of circling you is there

the all misty step on the ledge trick is

there a Ledge there is the balcony that

Miranda just left there's also there's

also a 10-foot high ledge with a ramp

leading up to it and that's the ledge of

palton is standing on and the ledge with

the big giant Gong every time the gun

comes up Nate's face just goes oh okay

so I'm gonna stay looks like there's a

Ledge on the basin like a little like on

the map mm-hmm a little like step I'll

just step up onto that ledge okay and

we're standing on the edge of the basin

yeah I would like to fireball the

out of these snakes please all right I

would like to cast a level 5 fireball on

these snakes please do they're too many

space yes you can get at least well

let's see it's a 20-foot radius fireball

so yeah you didn't get like ten of them

good appear to be all in well the other

snake is gone there's no talking and

it's fine yeah okay okay roll roll your

damage case I'm using the dice roller

because there's too many weird oh wait

hold on I think I messed it up dude

keeps doing that

okay well I'm just going to do it

normally then because we love the

clatter of little dice 17 plus 20 oh my

gosh

okay whoosh this huge green flame

explodes around the room washes up the

walls you see little snakes getting

burnt and singed inside but they're more

resilient than they would seem to be and

although many of them are looking bad

Lee burned they are all still very much

alive and continuing to ride their way

into the room okay I'd like you strix

I'd like you to make a perception check

please and Miranda I'll have you make it

as well nine well to help oh okay good

bye Wow good all right God Wow my eagle

eyes see you see you while strix is

standing on the lip of the basin and

blasting snakes off in one direction

your eyes are drawn into the basin where

you see that the coagulating blood is

kind of moving around on its own Andrey

shaping itself into you see you you

totally can well actually you know it's

not your action so you totally can't but

you can make you can make the motion

like you want to grab her you see as the

blood reshapes that it's taking on the

form of what appears to be a face like a

mask or something resting down upon the

basin but it's quite large maybe about

six foot seven feet big and it's got

this sort of Sheen to it and this

smoothness to it even though it's made

out of this sort of blood-red color that

almost looks elfin or very sort of

elegant features you think it is the

face of a woman okay yeah and as it

forms you see its eyes open and just

stare at you and that's tricks and it's

not a woman I recognize it is no it is

not you haven't seen it oh no a lot of

blood ladies that I need to scream it's

not a free action I think it is evil I

will make a perception check as well oh

oh you will just break before your turn

okay Oh nineteen oh good you see the

face forming in the basin below you

right behind strix and you can see that

coming out of the face the blood is sort

of stretching outward almost like

spidery tendrils coming out of its sides

it's like getting it's like spreading

out in the basin does it look what I

find its posture to be threatening it

has no posture because it's just a face

in the blood a giant eye base that's

pretty threatening in itself I think I

think elands reaction she's got Moonbeam

going she's like that'll a snake people

right

like she's she sees this and she's but

the other thing that you notice evylyn

is that the sculpture of rosin ICI is

moving the stone is actually undulating

and shifting up near the ceiling it's

like and Darwin the den dar aa sculpture

this massive stone snake sculpture is

coming to life over your head

Oh for heaven's sake and now it is your

action well so this sculpture so that I

have a better idea it's like on the wall

it's like a mural sculpture so the there

are pillars in this Cathedral that go up

to these arches and buttresses that

support this kind of arched ceiling and

there are ledges all around that sort of

upper level and this sculpture has been

carved almost like kind of be resting on

top of those ledges coiled all around

release and it's a massive sculpture

like if you were to if the sculpture

were a real snake and you were to

stretch it at it might be like 80 or 90

feet long but because it's coiled around

the roof it doesn't quite look that big

but it's obviously massive it it seems

to be moving and shifting about like

it's just waking up from asleep even is

developing a serious dislike for snakes

to the right place yeah yeah and there's

still how many snake like you aunty

snake people or there are still about

thirty of them two of them are basking

in your Moonbeam right now which are

still maintaining concentration on and I

can maintain concentration until I cast

another spell right or until you take

damage or something that causes their

concentration to break but yes until you

cast another spell you can continue to

maintain this thing now moving it I

believe is your is another action yeah

but I could for example attack with tree

Bain and maintain concentration you

could

you think you probably would do more

damage with the Moonbeam simply because

you can as an action move at 60 feet in

any direction and you can you can cover

a lot of ground

yeah and just sort of raise them all

okay yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna do that

cuz all right I think everybody's

threatened by these snake people so evil

ins like she she's looking at the blood

blood lady and then looking at the snake

coiling around and she's just kind of

like ah but she's she's as a side

thoughts still just like vacuuming up

the slate snake people with the Moonbeam

just kind of like while she watches them

the AUSA's you know par for the course

yes

hard for the court alright so yes your

Moonbeam just glances around the room

moving around engulfing all the snakes

and you're sort of directing it with

your finger roll to d10 radiant damage

yay and as your I think they were all

the 10 in a 1 okay so average damage

that's good yeah all right so as they're

getting singed for 11 unless they save

they will take five but as they're being

singed they're all being turned back

into their normal you want e-forms

by the spell so these snakes are

suddenly blossoming into these half

serpent man creatures or women creatures

and they've all got different or they're

different color scales some of them have

the snake bodies with the human upper

torso some of them have the human bodies

with the snake head some of them have

human bodies but snakes for arms fact

there's one in front of Deeb right now

who's threatening him with his snaky

arms you have revealed all of their true

forms literally compels you exactly and

you see that as they're forced out of

their shape change state that they

materialize with their weapons their

scimitars and their bows and such which

were absorbed into their snake-like

forms and then let's see the bad guys go

so these serpents these serpent people

begin to attack you in the case of oh

wait a minute

ice ok Pulteney or rate after them the

one in two closest to you DF are going

to come at you with their snaky limbs

now what's your HC depends I don't

remember if I had the finger protection

on or not you are the one without it

that's right 17 okay 17 all right one of

them misses you with his snaky arms the

other one hits you twice

you take boy 12 damage from the first

bite and nine damage from the second for

a total I would like to uncanny dodge

that 12 okay you take six and nine for a

total of fifteen yes miss you guys

having grown up HP all right you too

don't worry there's only 30 of these

guys Miranda you are shot at with

poisoned bolts okeydoke

um now I know that you cast protection

from poison on somebody I think yeah

yeah yeah okay great and okay so you're

a see if I recall 67 all right so a

number of bolts come in your direction

and three of them hit you and you take

thirteen points of damage from the first

fourteen points of damage from the

second so that's twenty seven and nine

from the third so that's 36 points of

damage

total nice I think we're going overhead

as arrows begin to you paulten you two

are targeted by a number of arrows

excuse me

and yeah yeah yeah and your AC is not

great not great no you got there you got

the ring on stuff plus one plus one okay

so that's 1414 okay what yeah you are

hit by six of these arrows cool and you

have no poison to worry about so I will

just total them up 28 31 so you take a

total of 40 cat shadow saying that

Chet was saying Paulton was invisible at

the end of the last session that's right

you are invisible forget I said that

all of those arrows are directed at

Strix all right

but Strix is AC is not no it's not it's

12

so Strix takes four 41:51

damage yeah you know I can't take that

okay so yeah I'll take the 40 yeah so

Strix is shot up like a pin cushion and

just falls back into the basin and and

Miranda as you're reaching out for her

you just see some thumb thumb thumb

thumb and then she falls out of your

grasp and lands in the blood as Strix

falls in the blood you can see that the

face opens its mouth and as it does the

tendrils coming off it start to look

like bleh

[Laughter]

all right

and then she falls right into its mouth

and it just swallows her up and she no

no no so Chris are you like mad at us no

I'm delighted to be here today oh and I

love you all I remember you walked into

this place willingly okay well you know

yes you're supposed to do in a dungeon

yeah

evylyn you've got some arrows coming

your way to evylyn doesn't react to

those at all she's 100% staring at

strict seems like ungodly mechanical

scream coming from her okay but her I'm

a class I guess screech your armor class

is currently 17 correct yes okay you are

hit by three bolts and they do they do a

total of 31 points oh it came back with

y 31 31 so you sort of ignore these

arrows that kind of sink into your body

as you stare down at the bloody face

that has just swallowed your teeth fling

sorcerer and palton you are sending

invisible next to the gong you saw Strix

get shot fall back and disappear into

the basin

you see Miranda get hit by bolts you saw

DF get accosted and you saw evil and

just get punctured a couple times but

you are by yourself up there with that

big gone

but I saw all of it so now I don't know

I'm not I've been waiting a week uh-huh

you can still hit the gong after

everyone is safe no okay so what

happened

so closest to you would be seeing

Miranda reach out in vain as Strix falls

back into the basin with a sploosh into

the blood and then is gone she's gone

yeah do I get a sense that the gong

could be helpful you don't oh it's gonna

be helpful to somebody but you you don't

know you

you have no there's nothing there's no

clue on the gong other than it does have

these serpentine motifs sort of

ornamenting it embossed upon its surface

it obviously fits with the decor than

the rest of the temple it's got a big

mallet hanging from one of its support

pillars behind you by the way is an open

passage a wide open passage that seems

to go back into the depths of the temple

I'm running but I'll keep that in mind

yeah okay and again how many snake

people am i seeing you're seeing dozens

oh good yeah like twenty four thirty

somewhere in there maybe more and now

they're all because they've all assumed

their normal kind of size they're taking

up a lot more of the area so there is

actually like a large crowd of serpent

folk in this temple

and they do they all are they all like

okay they don't know that you're there

apparently and how far up and like am i

you're a 10 feet off the the rest of the

floor of the temple with a Rams just

screaming and pointing its tricks if I

were to like try and like jump down

there would I like would I land in like

the middle of a bunch of them uh no

actually there is a clear space right

below you but could I yes you could jump

up one end of the balcony closer to or

one end of this raised ledge closer to a

mob of them okay and do I have a sense

of like how close together they are

they're pretty compact like if you were

to jump into the midst of one you would

be within like striking distance of six

of them at least okay can I freaking be

super anime right now and jump off that

into the middle of them wait and try and

land with a fifth level thunder wave

just in the middle of all of them yeah

nah dude you're not Naruto enough yeah

in fact it would probably be like

depending on where you're hoping to push

them probably be better kind of jump

behind them see them them outward

because it sort of radiates out almost

like a fan from you that sounds good

yeah okay yeah you jump down you unleash

the spell you become visible as you do

and they are all all and given the range

of the spell yeah you can hit them

easily so cool they all seem to fail

there saves all right so that's two

three four five sixty eight that's okay

okay okay so time to quick maps when I

say six yeah okay so so another thunder

wave goes off who needs a gong yeah

right

so 2600k

yeah you blast them and they go flying

and their corpses just sort of flop all

over the floor some of them are blasted

up against the the blood base and others

are kind of thrown up against the snake

sculpture is holding up the bigger

balcony and they all sort of collapse

into a heap having taken a bunch of

damage from the moon beam and the

fireball I'm just like standing there

with smoke coming off me I'm just like

you bastards took me away from my comm

you see Simon up standing next to the

gong Chris Perkins is gonna hit that

gong one way or another can I can I call

to Simon to try and shoot a dart at

something first uh yeah all right Simon

kill now Gong later yes he will he will

waddle on over to the nearest you want

he open his mouth and shoot a dart at it

and hits it good now you want to you

have some resistance to fight other

immune to poison okay so his little dart

anoi is the you want a blink and he just

pulls it out of its neck and this is

you've gotta at least pinch or something

it does pinch for like 50 points of

damage no no it pinches for one point of

damage and then Simon will just turn his

head 180 degrees and look at you and

give you a thumbs up alright you tell

them to run

that's a movement left so oh yeah it's

like okay now he's pissed get away from

him okay he'll run and hide behind on

the backside of the gong

good boy all right oh boy

Miranda your religion your veggie

pygmies start to pile into the room they

swarm past dragon bait they come they

just like a like an animated garden they

just sort of wash across the floor and

this Green Wave and throw themselves

bodily upon me you want to you that

attacked you and start to stick them

with Spears Oh little buddies unless you

want them to do something else

no I think that's that's good yeah but I

I'm going to warn them too because

they're more interested in the health

and welfare of their queen and

themselves and they continued to stab

with their flinty Spears and the snake

men don't like that either and many of

the snake men go down under the mass of

this green vegetation carpet and that

leaves dragon bait by the sort of

entrance that you guys came in and you

can see that he's actually sort of

physically holding waffles back in the

hallway and he's got the he just sort of

scooped the little Triceratops

under his arm and just sort of standing

there protectively guarding the animals

[Music]

no Miranda I'd like you to make another

perception check since you're the only

one close enough to be able to sense

this I'm like stress sweating at this

point do my tummy hurt 16 that is enough

you sense coming from his direction a

strong odor of violence oh and then I

yeah

violets like the flowers and it seems to

be kind of coming from the direction of

the albear the dry the the dinosaur man

and the little baby Triceratops and you

can see that he is actually kind of

there's you don't have a good read on

this dragon this dinosaur man you

haven't

very long he's kind of a cipher to you

but there is something about his posture

that is not threatening that suggests

that he thinks there's something

something horribly horribly horribly

wrong happening or about to happen and

he's actually withdrawing backing up

into the hallway and pushing trying to

push the El bear back out of the room

evylyn unfortunately you can't smell

this because you have no sense of smell

in da or a bit too far away to pick up

on the scent but it is Dee's turn there

- you want tea threatening you in melee

right now with snakes for arms right and

the other you want to you're farther

back in de that temple either have been

knocked off their feet by Paul tans

thunder wave scorched by Strix is

fireball or swarmed by Miranda's vege

'epic me or me right so quick count how

many of these snake people are currently

remaining you count maybe exactly two

dozen 24 around there okay and so this

just blood cauldron that yeah Strix fell

into how dug deep is this it's not very

deep it's it's a very shallow pool from

the lip down to the very bottom it might

be about five feet deep but from your

angle because you're on the floor you

can just kind of see over the top of it

Lille because you're between five and

six feet tall okay um and I've got these

two in melee with me yeah cutting action

to disengage and a basic like back role

and as I'm tumbling backwards as Susak

it's my hands a handspring back up and

like launched back onto my feet and get

up to that blood called Rijn okay so

you've basically disengaged yes okay

yeah you hop onto the cauldron you can

see that this face with the blades

coming off

is already starting to lose its cohesion

and sink back down into the bottom of

the bowl and then do that thing where

like I kind of have to hoist myself over

where I'm leaning into the blood puddle

and yes reaching down is deeper than

oscillators oh I'm just looking for some

parts trees just grab and get her out

all right all of dieta probably like

getting submerged with it all right make

a strength saving throw baby yeah you're

good at these right so it's a saving

throw

it's a saving throw how new buys evylyn

I'm like about 10 feet in the air 10

feet in the air will say it will say

you're 10 feet in the air

look at that okay take that +5 23 okay

when you stick your hand in to grab

force tricks some you grab onto

something and it grabs on to you it is

trying to pull you in do you want to be

pulled in or not you actually have a

choice because you made your save you

can you can even grab on and not be

pulled in if you want it be stretched

pulling me back it's it's strong

whatever it is so it's not that I

grabbed held of suck grab hold something

something else was grab hold of me you

reached in to grab her right yes you

think you may have gotten her but you

can't tell because you're reaching

through opaque blood but you've grabbed

something and as soon as you grabbed it

it latched on to you and now is dragging

you down into the bowl that you made

your save so you're not being pulled I

don't know

now on your power out it's not coming

whatever it is and so like it's no way

like this is and this isn't so deep but

like there's no it's very shallow the

pool is not deep at all like your hand

has gone farther into the blood than

there's blood to be had and I did not

find her you don't know well onion you

either either either she's desperately

strong right now

and trying to pull you in or it's

something else trying to pull you in I

go in all right

evylyn you see DF finally decide to let

go of the edge of the basin which he was

holding on to to keep from dragging in

and he just sort of slides down into the

blood and he's gone I think as soon as

Strix had been swallowed up like the

instant that she went broke into the

blood evylyn had already turned and like

superhero straight arrow

right into the blood she has to move yet

so well that's what she does now well

first of all Miranda you see DF reach

down into the basin and then steel

himself and hook himself in and then

decide it looked like he just sort of

let go and went in and he sank into the

blood and disappeared Can I grab on to

like a back of a shirt or something so I

can get pulled in with him if you want

to reach into the now mostly just sort

of settling blood and try to grab hold

of him you can no I'll wait okay it is

your turn is it now okay I'm going to do

a little film of the summer court on

myself I'm gonna use two of my D sixes

get myself some health so I got nine and

three I'm gonna go in okay I'm

gonna go in yeah let's do it let's do it

you leap down into the pool and you find

yourself standing in a shallow pool of

blood apparently the blood is no longer

pulling things in it's just old blood do

I have anyone with them in life you do

it only took you about ten feet to get

into the pool all right I'm done with

this pool party so I'm gonna just rush

right for dragon bait okay I want to get

over there okay make a perception check

for me see if you notice anything in the

chaos

9:18 all right as you climb out of the

pool

you can see that the doors that DF was

previously standing next to opposite to

the gong that they are opening you can

hear them sort of grind open and be

pulled open but it's so dark beyond you

can't see what if anything is going to

emerge from them I just point that out

as you make your way toward dragon bait

it may or may not affect your decision

as I'm running I'm just gonna point and

scream because I don't I don't know how

what's going on I have no words for this

when you look up by the way you see this

huge coiling stone serpent coming to

life up in the ceiling it's starting to

lower its big head down toward evil and

scream at that too and it opens its big

giant Stoney mouth oh okay okay yes and

when you run over to toward dragon bait

there's a carpet of your veggie pygmies

around you and they're all attacking the

you auntie and keeping them pretty much

busy but they kind of Cree

eight they parked like the Red Sea in

front of you this Greenway just sort of

gives away and creates a path of escape

for you - dragon mate okay I want to

start to drag them with me - and you can

tell as you grab a couple by the limbs

and start to drag them along they're

still sort of stabbing at the aunty as

you're pulling them back because they're

absolutely furious that you got hurt and

as you drag them behind you and you get

close you can tell that the scent of

violets is coming from dragon bait he is

exuding it that's weird

okay yeah everything about this group is

weird I like it all right and he's got

the triceratops tucked under one arm and

is pushing with the other hand on

waffles for head to try to get the

albear to go back when all the al bear

wants to do is charge into the temple

okay I don't think I could do anything

house yeah you're pretty much bent at

this point less you have a bonus action

you want to do colleague let me find

this guy and see if it's bonus action I

don't think it is but just in case no

okay

strix all right I'm so scared when you

so you you're you feel like you're

drowning in blood and what do you want

to do

I'm drowning you're immersed in some

sort of effluvium I don't want to be

here so I'm just gonna try and swim okay

you're not terribly far below the

surface and you feel something reach

down and grab hold of you talking back

to me and conscious again yes okay you

are conscious okay something has just

grabbed hold of you

well I'm just gonna assume it's my

friends pulling me out of the blood yeah

I'm just gonna let it go okay when you

break this right when you break the

surface you are being pulled out of not

blood but quicksand and the figure

pulling you out is someone is vaguely

recognizable to you you're pretty sure

you've seen this individual before he's

he's a sort of short portly dark-skinned

man with puffy cheeks and a laurel

wreath of flowers around his head and

you he grabs hold of you and literally

pulls you out of this mire okay not

ensure not is it show up not in shawl

it appears to be in Scheldt I'm insured

yes you are in you are this this

quicksand that you fell into is

surrounded on all sides by just tangled

vines and thick vegetation through which

you can see almost tunnels heading off

into the deep dark jungle the other

thing that you notice is that the two of

you are not alone in addition to this

man there are three small figures sort

of clustered around him and they all

peer out and you recognize them as toy

evylyn toy paltin and toy DF Oh

okay and they're standing on their own

they are and I've met this guy before

who's this guy

make a percept or make an make either a

wins with wisdom insight or perception

wisdom perception okay

you think you have not seen this man in

the flesh you have only seen him as a

statue and it is up to its yes real a

real power you he gives you a quizzical

look and says are you okay

you fell I am NOT quicksand I did not

fall through a quicksand I fell in a

pool of blood your toys came to get me

my toys came to get you your friends

she's just--she's curls up into a ball

on the ground and starts crying yes are

you trying to get yourself killed

because there's no way out of here by

that route others have tried wait which

route are you talking about

I just I we were trying to stop whereas

me see that's what we we're here okay

yes you keep saying that but who is this

resin you see nursing he's a surcin no

we're never gonna get anywhere oh can

the toys talk yes they can

in fact dr Jared Nathan and evylyn you

can talk out of these toys as you see

fit what yep and you have all that you

have all the experiences that you have

had before

Talton toy calls out uh context please

evylyn is even toy is looking at her

hands and going not again yeah these are

the same ones I made these are the exact

same ones that you made did they not

like them and throw them away she gets

really fun toys okay yes you have okay I

didn't animate these did they just come

to life well so Derek clones um

OOP Tao will tell you as you have told

him before that that you made these toys

these are your friends I've told him

before

yes who which me you he says it is it is

the nature of this place that we're in

that sometimes we forget why we're here

oh oh oh that's magic right yes makes

sense but you're a god you're a power no

you're not no you were no then what are

you I'm a man you're just you just did

you just a guy I'm just a guy your shoes

are nice though mm-hmm what is it toy

palton he says a poignant yes these once

seemed a lot more suboptimal than the

real ones yes he says I'm just a guy I

was sent here just like you I used to

have a shop in sigil oh she's like she's

like putting that up

yep did did you ever meet me there I'm

from there I'm I what I was we didn't

meet until we ended up here oh and

you've been in here a lot longer than I

have

what

and here this place yes what is it like

so I've been in here before most of your

adult life from what you've told me in

the past what you're in this place yes

ah now what you did to get banished to

the mazes I have no idea I don't think

that that memory has ever come back to

you at least you've never told me about

it

excuse me she's just like rolling on the

floor right now just screaming like

please explain tell me everything I told

you don't leave anything out everything

is bad

what did I do evylyn it's your turn we

are back in the temple

what oh okay all right so real construct

evylyn back in the you auntie temple you

see

Miranda sort of jumped into the blood

and found that there was nothing to jump

into except blood and then ran off

toward dragon bait leaving bloody

footprints in her wake you are still

over there poised to dive into the blood

but what do you want to do now with your

newfound knowledge

Miranda also warned you about the big

snake monster looming above you am i

100% convinced that there is nothing in

the Blood Basin anymore it looks like it

did before it started to kind of mutate

into that form it just looks like

there's a little bit of blood trickling

down through the the underneath the the

snake mouths of the balcony into the

basin and that it's just old bad blood

because what Ana would do is still dive

into the basin and frantically search

around and dive underwater and be

frantic about it but even doesn't think

that there's anything in there is that

what we're saying that's kind of what

you're saying yeah okay even looks

enraged okay and she does a little bit

of a slow turn toward this snake thing

it says bye bye son

bring it snake and she brings uh hmm hmm

I think she just holds she just holds

tree bane and glares at him and just

silently put Moonbeam on top of like

spins it around his entire body that's

all coiled around yeah just put it right

up to his face to put it between her and

him okay then that's your action and you

will do damage to it earlier damage dice

radiant damage it's still just to d-10

right it's to d-10 but as it passes over

this thing the you can see that it it

probably doesn't cause it as much

discomfort as you would have hoped but

go ahead and roll your damage it's only

seven okay it gets a little it just

looked cool a little brushing of

radiance sparks sort of burst on top of

its scales as you run this thing over

its body almost like rubbing Flint

against metal just but she looks really

mad and really scary so maybe she

intimidates him a little bit yes and

then when the light sort of falls

between you there is a moment where the

serpentine statue does kind of just sort

of blink like it's trying to wish that

light about of existence good yes and

it so that's your action you're

confronting denned are face to face the

bad guys are battling veg 'epic Me's at

the moment that takes the heat off of

paltin and so Miranda you see that these

you want t rear up over your veggie big

me hordes and just start hacking into

them what their scimitars and you see

the little veggie pizza heads fly off

like dandelions as they swish back and

forth over your armies but your veggie

pygmies do outnumber them so not able to

swipe clean or sight the way the entire

that you pick me threat but they are

dedicated to that task and one of them

one of the you auntie sort of picks up

the severed head of a bet you pick me

that still sort of his eyes are blinking

and just sort of looks at it and throws

it aside anything I'm missing oh yes

den dar will open its big jaws and try

to chomp down on evil in rolled an 18 on

the die which is 26 to hit you evil in

all right

yeah sure like I said bite me yeah it

does but what it really does it sort of

clamps down over you so that you are

kind of inside its head and then you

start to go tumbling down its gullet and

as the contractions of this creature

take you further and further and further

down you begin to realize that you are

not in simply a stone snake but in some

sort of weird ephemeral conduit of

course I am and just sort of tumbling

through and bouncing off of it's just

sticky lating walls oh oh me oh my oh me

all right all right you can hear like

that going from a tunnel out of the

snake's mouth you can hear

[Laughter]

all right and after what seems like an

eternity you tumble out into a hallway

like the snake the end of the snake just

turns into a hallway and just do a

couple flips and you earn he sort of

land sitting up in this hall and she's

still holding tree bane like this and

she's just kind of like what do I see

you can see three people sort of lying

in heaps around you one of them is Strix

one of them is paltin and one of them is

DF lying in here yeah and as you watch

you see three little lights sort of come

up out of their bodies and just get

drawn away she like scramble crawls over

to them they're all dead

I think she's she just sits back on the

floor like flat with her eyes open wide

and can't move okay

make a check Wow 20 so you believe what

you've just witnessed is the souls of

your dead friends being snatched away by

the soul monger and the sudden

realization that you may only have a

limited amount of time to save them

before their souls are consumed what do

I have any idea how no but you do get

the sort of instinctive sense that you

might be in the tomb the very tomb where

this device lies you can almost hear it

throbbing just she's like she can't cry

right but you see this like emptiness in

her eyes and she like picks herself up

with so much effort just like the the

weight of her own body is too much for

her and she glowers at the pulsing sound

takes one step and then another and then

another and then just full bore running

toward the sound the pulsing something

okay all right yes as you run down the

hallway past your fallen friends you can

see it goes for some distance and this

dungeon hall is not perfectly said it

looks ancient and old and it's sort of

shifted over time so some of the blocks

are misshapen and the ceiling sags in a

few places but as you run you can see it

kind of bend in a direction you follow

that and it takes you out into what

appears to be a larger chamber that has

old stone walkways all around its

exterior and it's like a big square

shaft that goes down into the earth with

these crumbling staircases descending

around its outside but the the main part

of the room is a big empty shaft

and obviously you can flies do you have

to worry too much about the crumbling

stairs but you hear coming from the

depths of this shaft that thrumming that

sort of pulsating sound almost like a

some sort of mechanized heartbeat below

you suggesting and that's where the soul

and monger lies and I even is fairly

assured that she is hearing the soul

monger and that's what she's running

toward right her based on her insight

check that's what her instincts tell her

she has no little no real evidence to

back it there's just this overwhelming

sense that that must be what it is in

her mind and she believes that if she

can destroy destroy the soul longer

itself than her friends souls with its

it was destroyed soon enough you could

release the souls trapped within and

your friends would not be consumed for

all eternity and obliterated for all

time and if say for example she just

blew up the soul monger it wouldn't

damage souls right you believe you you

get the sense that it kind of contains

them or traps them so that they can't be

brought back or salvaged or anything

it's like a receptacle

evylyn she's you know running full bore

down the hall and you hear kind of the

like many how many ways it's like you

evylyn you are a receptacle for a soul

as well your body is essentially serving

as a receptacle for you on some level

you think that's what the soul monger is

she has a little bit of a metaphysical

moment about that but you know there's

no time so she you know she's running

down that hole and you hear like the

Robocop ish like two piston leg you know

running and then she kind of takes

flight at that speed as she does she

grabs her bag and pulls out that egg

bomb okay can as she looks at it does

she feel like she remembers how to

operate it uh yeah strix explained it to

her and the not-too-distant past so yeah

she thinks she could all right she just

tucks it under one arm and as she

reaches the lead

where it goes into this shaft she just

dives straight down into the okay aft

and into the darkness goes the light

paltin you're in me shrine you're in the

shrine

you see Miranda has sort of gone through

the parted for veggies and run back

toward dragon bait on the far side of

the temple between them and you is an

army of veg 'epic Me's and an army of

you want a hacking at each other and

stabbing at each other with weapons it's

a total total chaotic fracas nothing is

currently threatening you you saw evil

and disappear down the gullet of this

serpent Dende are still clinging to the

ceiling in its stony form but also I'm a

doll and also I'm dead

oh you're fine you're fine I'm fine yeah

yeah so so you even went down went down

snake yeah

dia and Strix disappeared into the basin

which is what I was gonna try and follow

him but I see now that that's just that

that's not that didn't work for Miranda

so you're not sure it would work for you

every everything I was gonna do just

like wall no seems like he really really

wants you to hit that gong or something

Talton just loose around he's like

it and he's the the ring of winter yes

you summon up big bees hand of ice and

just wail that Gong with it okay

this big fist of ice slams into the Gong

when that happens Miranda a port a

portcullis drops between you and dragon

bait and you just sort of hit it another

court color drops behind the gong

with a loud cthe ank sound and trapped

in here with me what has happened just

[Laughter]

just right as it happens yeah the hand

hit hits the gong

yeah then most those things come down

you looks just ah goddammit alright that

is the only thing that happens for now

but the sound of the sound of the gong

you can hear it seems to echo out into

distant parts of the you want a layer

and kind of bounce back at you and you

hear in the distance somewhere something

this sort of ring the gong and Simon

stands there I hear I hear this noise

this the gong the doors and then the

whispering yeah a wise wise warrior once

told me it is a good day to die alright

dragon bait looks at Miranda through the

bars of the portcullis and his scent

changes from violets

to him and then he just sort of retreats

and backs away from you why do you smell

like a pig little triceratops begins

another triceratops we get annoying on

him he didn't want him but and you can

see that waffles sort of pushes past

dragon bay this time sort of presses him

up against the wall with the sheer force

of her body and throws herself up

against the bars it just starts to

headbutt the bars over and over and over

again and you're right there Miranda

you're seeing this huge beast just throw

itself in growl at the bars which do not

give an inch but it is DF Stern DF you

fall into something cold and wet huh

when you look up you see you're lying in

snow am I covered in blood yes and you

see sort of falling down into the snow

beside you are too torn off angel wings

what and the blood is coming from you

like on my back oh yeah it's sort of

it's sort of dripping down all over you

your back and as you look up in the snow

and you look around you see that the

snow on the ground is falling up into

the sort of silvery sky and all the you

see buildings on both sides of you so

tall and of such composition

that you think you're in water deep in

winter that familiar blistering cold

suddenly comes back to you like yes and

you see a shape at the end of the alley

that you're in it is dark almost black

in its in distinctiveness but clearly a

man of some kind and wearing some sort

of billowing cloak that the winter wind

is catching just sort of flapping around

you and that's the sound you hear like

the flapping of the flapping of the

cloak you can see that the torn off

wings to either side of you are sort of

this kind of grayish hue with sort of

silvery gold and silver and gold tinges

to them you don't feel pain from the

blood but it's clearly yours uh-huh

like i mediate i look around we're Strix

uh when you look around you see make a

perception check first of all okay

eleven through the snow so you've got

this man figure sort of standing at one

end of the alley looking at you you're

kind of in the middle of the alley at

the other end of the alley which sort of

crooks a little to the side you can hear

some sort of scratchy voice of somebody

who like sounds like they're rooting

through a trash can and as you sort of

move to one side to get a better angle

where there's this little kink in the

alley you see that you see it is Strix

with her her witch hat which has got

some snow on it and her black over cloak

and she is hunched over a can of trash

and pulling things out of it and just

sort of throwing them willy-nilly and

I'm in the hall on this alleyway

basically yes when you look like at the

man you see that his eyes begin to glow

blue a cold winter blue and they're both

not the same distance away from me about

30 40 feet away and I can't really see

his full face just his eyes are glowing

yeah just his glowing eyes and his dark

silhouette if you didn't know better

you'd think it was straud oh except his

eyes glowed red

DFL like slowly rise to his feet still

like feeling I have to cold the snow

yeah and everything like looks it's like

look back at Strix yeah back to this

strange figure yeah so staring here and

there a little sort of like spurts of

blood coming off you and just sort of

falling into the white snow around you

and then like basically like kind of

start stepping towards Strix like kind

of backwards is you kind of like what's

this guy and then I turns away from and

just like goes to Strix okay as you head

towards Strix she seems so preoccupied

with finding something useful in this

trash she hasn't given you any hint that

she knows that you're even there she's

just sort of hunched over with her back

to you and picking through stuff okay

you can get as close to her as you want

to yeah and then like as I kind of get

as I kind of get close enough where you

know I could probably talk to her it's

like it was a shaky hand out just Strix

when you touch her she turns to you and

you see it's not Strix at all but a

swarm of cranium rats wearing her hat

and her cloak they're just all sort of

up in this sort of humanoid form these

rats with these exposed brains and they

all look at you and you see their little

brains pulse and you get this telepathic

shriek ah and they say when they

recognize you they say we are many you

are one

and then they just lose their cohesion

billow out from under strict cease robes

and ghosts camping off in all directions

through the snow but these are like

strictest robes right unlike them yes

they it looks exactly like Strix has had

exactly like Strix his robe you even see

little bangles and things on the robe

suggesting that they were taken off of

her or given to these creatures by her

yeah you like like basically goes like

the robes right away Janina they're

scampering about yeah it's just yells

had they all sent them saying where is

she where is she all right

Miranda this albear throws itself up

against the gate there is a host of you

auntie behind you hacking to pieces your

vegetation er me and they in turn are

stabbing the you auntie through their

bodies with spears oh this is just you

know I'm gonna grab celery I'm gonna

find celery that makes him yep and I'm

gonna look to paltin and cast hidden

pathways on him and send him to wear

waffles is on the other side of the gate

and then I'm gonna grab as many other

edge of pygmies as I can and look at the

other one that I'm leaving behind and

hidden pathways back with him as well to

the other side of the gate okay

so you can do one bonus action on your

turn so you're one bonus action is to

use hidden paths to put celery on the

safe side so he is now on the other side

of the gate and safe although there's a

rampaging el bear there I'm taking

taking most the space but you can sort

of put him behind the hole there and

then yeah you've gathered up two more

can I can I put celery through the gate

will he fit I will hmm interesting

they are pretty malleable guys I will

have make a strength check with

advantage because he is actually trying

to help you by sucking in his veggie gut

job buddy yeah you managed to cram it

through and you're kind of feeling kind

of sad because the space gets a little

mangled and as he's pushed through but

he does and he put a spurt he sort of

goes through kind of around by the foot

of the albear and then manages to

squeeze out and go run underneath the

albear to get out from its path so we've

got two of them out okay well long a

food safe I got I got two of them in

there yeah I'm gonna forget that was a

that was basically an action and a bonus

action all right then I'm just gonna see

what happens next

okay Chris when I was transported with

Simon with me transported was I was just

like put on the other side of the gate

by that right did you do that or did I

miss here other said that she's out so

she's talking about her adventure

pigmies was it I did halten I'm sorry I

misheard you but for some reason I

thought you said you sent celery through

the get through the magic well I wanted

to send all right with hidden pathways

very good okay so Paul to know she's

trying to magically transport you to the

side of the gate with waffles and dragon

bait on it it has to be a willing

creature are you willing Ken is Simon

Simon would not go with you nope Miranda

because he's not willing you can try to

use it on somebody else

Oh use it on myself okay he's not gonna

go alright go okay you are now on the

side with the

albear and dragon bait and celery I'm

gonna shut it up and get the over

here I got it I can do that too okay

I'll do it I will in however many

seconds is required until I am able to

do so all right coming through the doors

Miranda that you saw open you can just

kind of see through past waffles now

into the room you see it is one of your

former adventuring companions which one

Typho the halfling is he okay yeah he's

sort of kind of stealthily cautiously

peers in kind of the suss out things and

then he moves very sneakily into the

room you know him well enough to you

know him well enough to know his moves

he's trying not to be seen

I'm gonna grab the bars and just shake

them and scream alright if he heard you

he doesn't seem to give you any clue

that he did and he sort of disappears

among the the basin okay

Mickey perception check 25 wow that's

really good I have a plus eight you

notice as he gets close to the basin

[Music]

that he does actually cast an eye over

toward you and for an instant you sort

of look at him and you see that his eyes

are like those of a serpent and that

wasn't what he looked like when the last

you saw him bro

yes and then you see that as he

disappears behind the basin he is

heading toward paltin trying not to be

seen and he's got a bag

he's got a dagger in his hand can i warm

paltin at all talking as a free action

god damn it he was my friend and he's

been altered please step in nicely Strix

you are with your little doll friends

and OOP Tao will say that he believes

and he has no way to really prove this

being where he is that he has been stuck

in the mazes for some oh no 22 odd years

you claim to have been stuck in or he

thinks based on the stories you told him

that you've been stuck here for at least

80 or maybe 75 years and you made you

made a bunch of friends out of these

materials that you found to upset your

so but he's heard all about your

adventures to the faraway castle and

your trudging through the snow and all

those other all those other fanciful

stories that you told him but he says

they are mere fancy no no no no no no no

those are real no no no no no those are

real no no no no those are those are a

hundred percent and he says don't you

remember when you mocked me and you

thought that I was the one who

responsible for making all of this

because I have this symbol that I found

this oh my god I showed you a disk with

all this maze-like pattern on it no no

no no no oops how doesn't have to do

with the mazes and sigil no no no no no

that's not connected at all that's what

I've been trying to tell you this is no

no no no this is just a family heirloom

that I had on me at the time it's

meaningless other than you know

sentiment oh no no but you seem to

ascribe some great divine power to it

like somehow this is the key to your

escape that's why you dragged me along

all this time right how long have you

been here cutter well we've known each

other what now for several weeks we

there's

there's no way there's no ever since you

came to the jungle ever since I came we

met on the bridge that's the first time

you saw the town but you weren't real

yes it was no you're no you're barmy you

weren't real this isn't real this isn't

real she starts going around the whole

rig way it's not real and just like

grabbing things and going it's not real

your toys look very confused I think my

toys are traumatized crazy they probably

are we have the same face Susan's gonna

look look at you I'll be like what did I

talk about but if these are the mazes

what got me in here I was hoping you

would tell me finally now that we trust

each other at least the women what did

you do you said you you you said you

were in here since you were since you

even be like just before you met your

friends I was in here yeah you were

picking trash out of an alley and that's

where you met that's where you found him

and then you dressed him up and

something no he got torn apart by I

don't know something in that castle

place you went to and then you remade

him no no no how many times have you how

many times have you fixed that doll now

no no no no no this is not no no I was a

Barbie the you are Barbie and I'm not

talking to you that's this is weird I'm

not talking anymore

what no I still you must have offended

somebody pretty important to get cast in

the mazes I have an idea who I offended

but I don't remember offending them so

anyway um anyway I don't want to get

into the hole where my friends these

aren't my friends these are dolls I

these are not my friends they were I was

just fighting snake laughs I am glad

that you finally finally realizing it no

no no all this talk about this little

doll using his little sword to make a

little dimension where a fox leading

come through and tried to get you out of

here

that just never happened right do yes do

it use your sword use your sword she's

gonna look a little D at all be like do

it alright do you have to take styluses

little coffin now just like this you

know what happened nothing happens like

mercy killers did mercy killers come

after me do you remember that did I talk

about that you talked a lot about that

and actually maybe you ran into

something because I'm sure there are

some in here somewhere

[Laughter]

chuckling at me and drinking he says I

can see we have a long way to go no no

no are we trapped in here

everybody's trapped in here there's no

escape from the mazes no no you've said

that yourself I didn't do this I didn't

do this I didn't do this that's it's I'm

innocent I didn't I didn't commit any

crimes I did not do this everybody in

here says they're innocent do you know

of any like they're all crazy cycle

planar families who are the Skiz --ax

who are they

she like stamps on the ground oh let's

see right there they're old if I

remember correctly they were humans who

made a pact with devils and transform

themselves into tea flings why why are

they what's their chasm that's not a

word mm-hm it's a it's what they became

at the end of the wars after so many had

died on both sides and the Accords was

right yeah who are these who's the other

side the lore kapha who are they

another family of homes with ties to the

angelic world

like pulling her hair out like how so

how do they become why are they are they

angel people um well they they had

angels trying to help them so but in the

end it looked like that they were going

to be destroyed so some sort of deal was

reached that's all I know some sort of

Accord to keep the multiverse in balance

some sort of what kind of deal is there

any reason why those Barbie are

after night maybe because you were

trying to break the deal what was the

deal that there would be he sort of

thinks about it he says that the two

sides would never go to war again and

never bring to them never bring the

multiverse to the precipice of

annihilation again provided they never

had anything more to do with each other

meaning and as part of the deal all of

the lore katha had to give up their

souls except one who is that I don't

know this was a long time ago

oh I'm just I'm just gonna say right now

that I have feeling that might have

something to do with me and this is not

real this is not real

that sounds real and bad and is there

bathroom in here I'm just really curious

or do you just poop on the floor so one

of the bad things about the mazes is

there are surprisingly few bathrooms all

right

evylyn when when you reach the bottom of

this chamber you can see that there is a

floor about 80 odd feet down the stairs

that clean the hug the wall the shaft do

end here then there is a pit in the

middle of the floor about I want to say

10 feet by 10 feet square pit

that has four columns standing around it

and atop those columns are four statues

each statue a four-armed gargoyle stands

its crouched on top of these cylinders

of stone on the edges of this pit and

arranged so the gargoyles seem to be

looking down into the pit but they're

immobile statuary these forearm

gargoyles they're just like statues not

moving an inch staring down into the pit

other than the pit there appear to be

three exits off the room tunnels going

off in three different directions so

there are a total of four directions one

could possibly go into the pit or out

one of these side tunnels and two of the

tunnels are quite wide and the other

branching tunnel is quite narrow do I

have a sense of where the pulsing sound

of the monger is you believe down into

the pit is the sound was where the sound

is coming from she can assuming that the

gargoyles are gonna start following her

they just might even don't would like to

know if she can have some of palton

dolls line please thank you okay yes as

you barrel past them you can hear them

now up above you start to move their

stone limbs grinding they have you

probably haven't moved in a long long

time but they are moving now and you can

hear their wings flex above you as you

drop like a stone down the shaft

Evelyn's not one to make obscene

gestures but if she was behind her she'd

just be flipping him the bird as she did

and when you crash down you land in a

five-sided room that has two exits

at two of its corners you can see that

there's a pungent stench in this

pentagonal room and the wall I can't

well that's right you can't smell

anything my mistake

get with it Chris Perkins yes totally

totally you see the walls have riveted

sheets of iron bolted to them there is a

wild garden full of sickly rotting

compost and dying plants all around you

on the floor

and there are sort of narrow paths

ending through them and what looks like

the rusted tip of some sort of weird

contraption like maybe a sprinkler

sticking out of the middle of the floor

but basically you're surrounded by

rotting vegetation with the hole in the

ceiling above you and the two passages

leading out

Evelyn's main goal is just like ignore

everything run for the soul monger so as

much as she sees this and may want to

investigate rotten vegetables which

would be totally counter to her

interests she ignores those and tries to

see which of the tunnels might lead

toward that pulsing sound making an

inside check oh please let the and ER

seventeen okay you follow one of the

tunnels instinctively believing it might

be the right direction to go it leads

you into another pentagonal room with an

exit on the far side there's a acid

scarring seems to cover the iron plates

on the walls and has pockmarked the

floor and you see pools of grey slime on

the floor as well which thankfully you

don't have to come into contact with you

can also see that along each wall are

sort of carved stone freezes of what

appear to be dragging like things but as

you flash across the room and make your

way through the other exit the room that

you actually end up in appears to be

some sort of weird control room it is

basically rectangular with patterns on

the walls and what looks like a console

in front of you and the console

Oh No okay

it is a console with a gold lever that

has a star at the end of it and then a

red button a blue button a red dial and

a blue dial and then there are weird

patterns on the wall that look very

peculiar at first glance to me they look

like they might represent some sort of

room or something like that is that well

yeah thanks yeah

does she recognize any of those rooms or

layouts since the rooms on the wall seem

to have almost a pentagonal shape she

thinks it may have something to do with

the level that she's on does she see a

big red X that says soul monger no there

seemed to be five different room

patterns on the wall numbered one two

three four five and number three is

currently got a little green light under

it the other ones their lights are not

lit but no no writing that suggests soul

monger no and above those designs you

can see what appeared to be holes in the

wall that have little bits of sort of

grey slime kind of dripping out them

almost like they're pipes that haven't

been closed off properly and acid

spotters on the walls hmm yeah but that

doesn't look like it's gushing out in

any great pace at least not now and

that's pretty much as far as you can go

so in the room Miranda and paltin back

up in the you auntie temple you see the

you auntie and the veggie pygmies still

in a pitched battle paltin what would

you like to do you've been warned by

Miranda about a halfling rogue do I see

him make a perception check needs

18 no 18 you look around our eyes

darting around the basin to see if you

catch a glimpse of this small figure you

see nothing there are lots of shadows

under there though so you know he's a

rogue worth his weight he probably is

pretty good at hiding all right I'm

gonna try to also make my back stabbing

sorry good okay I'm going to attempt to

make my way to Simon so that we may

dimension doors who wear waffles okay

yes you can pull yourself up and

actually Simon will come over to you and

kind of help pull you up with all of his

puppet might back up onto the ledge

because it's like a ten-foot height

you're trying to get up on so you leap

up he kind of grabs on to you and braces

and you you can scamper up and as you

are pulled up to the top you are beside

him at last and you still have an action

so I would like to dimension door if I

may

okay you dimension door you can bring

one willing creature with you so paltin

loop goes or sorry Paul Simon walks

through the door with you and you want

to be on the other side behind the

albear basically yes okay you succeed

you appear with dragon bait there's a

little vegetable with a boot on his head

next to you well Here I am rock me like

a hurricane let's see so that was a move

and in action so blah you're done dragon

bait smells like ham so you know that's

is this scent of worry he has trying to

think if he's going to try to

communicate any other information to you

in this moment oh boy if only he could

he needs like a magic marker or

something okay he starts to smell like

roses and then changes to brimstone and

then kind of hints of baked bread he

seems to be going through a lot of

emotions Paul just like me to my dude

why does he smell so much some of them

are good and the others are very strange

oh um that's what he's feeling I don't

really remember what they all mean but

the sheer quantity of it suggests that

he's going through a lot right now

ah so are all of us I think mm-hmm all

right

DF your turn you've got the robes and

hat of strix cranium rats scampering off

shouting we are many you uh-huh do they

they went all directions like there

wasn't okay you can see like one of them

goes to like this hole in the wall and

just sort of pulls a something that's

like piece of garbage that was stuck in

it out of the way so if Hoover's friends

can run into the wall and disappear and

then he goes in after and pulls the

garbage in behind him these are great

telogen rats there isn't there yeah they

don't seem to be having a singular

direction that seem to be worth

following yeah some of them are going up

up like a pipe up the walls of a

building disappeared going up into the

pipe and off the walls of the building

all right they're scattering okay

they're basically behaving exactly as

Strix would in a situation which she's

not comfortable yeah

I gather up strictest things her robes

in a hat I will just like be holding on

like i draped over my forearms okay now

here palton say why are you running away

I'm not gonna kill you not yet

huh what where did that come from it

came from the figure you left the one

with the blue eyes oh we're friends

aren't we

we're friends aren't we paltin this

version of you has us completely

subsumed its personality with the ring

of winter water deep is yours oh my god

that's kind of cool okay you've got your

grandfather's taste in cloaks Bolton's

right not really his grandfather but

it'd be more like his

great-great-grandfather yeah and there

is no sign of evil in you do not see her

all right nor is there any indication of

like a Sun in the sky that you can tell

it's just sort of a silvery color got it

okay

a door opens on the building next to you

and you see glimpses in the shadows of a

woman but it's hard to really tell her

her sort of dark skin complexion blends

in pretty well with the darkness but she

says come with me not a voice to

recognize not right off the bat no and

she says I can save your friends no I'm

fine

see we can make sure this never happens

DF is so very much filled with confusion

rage and despair you see some snakes

come out through the door and sort of

skittle off into the slither off into

the snow and she says you're trapped in

den DARS nightmare

let me help you escape

d/f takes slow deliberate cautious steps

towards the door you have nothing to

fear from us no but I have everything to

lose India feel like just enter towards

the door into wherever she is when you

enter she's sort of out stretches her

hand she's got some sort of golden

bracelets around her wrists and she just

sort of holds them out her her fingers

she got long fingernails sort of painted

a lustrous black and when she grabs hold

of you can see that her body trails off

into serpentine form and you can see

there are two others like her kind of

further back in the darkness and she

says don't be afraid we want to help you

how how can you help

how can I fix this

she says

you have what we have been waiting for

you can replace rosin ici

command us

what

we want to help you become one of us

it will save you it will save your

friends oh my god we must pull you out

of den DARS nightmare your friends are

trapped in the nightmare as well don't

you believe us what reason do we have to

lie

my name is feather

what would you have me do the question

isn't what would we you have what would

what we would have you do is what we

should do for you

what do you want of us what do you wish

us to do we will obey any command as

proof of our loyalty to you that you are

the one who should lead us free them get

them safe we get them out of wherever we

will just but we need you

only you

ah no one else is worthy no one else has

what you have what are you talking about

what do I have so and that's where we'll

stop I want to play I want to play yep

paulten huh yes hi it just is a little

coda

a little happy coda and Miranda just as

a happy coda as Yuri sort of retreat

from the temple and hear the gnashing of

weapons and the could the cutting down

of the verge as it were your wounds all

seem to just go away like it was all

some sort of dream I noticed her I

noticed her wounds heal I'm just like oh

man well too bad I wasn't touched that

entire time and then like part of you
