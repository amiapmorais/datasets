[Music]

all right

[Music]

[Laughter]

seconds all the chat just melt that was

dark three two one

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action season three hold on I always

have alright there we go thank you you

guys alright when last we left the

waffle crew they were in the frigid

north aboard an airship captained by a

half-elf sorcerer named as and Allah and

they were seeking an artifact on her

behalf and on behalf of the Harper's for

whom she works an artifact called the

ring of winter and as the waffle crew

was contending with a three-headed frost

giant a ice vulture swooped over their

heads and went outside with a rider on

its back but you took the you destroyed

the vulture the rider came tumbling down

onto the ice and where palton confronted

him hoping to get his hands on that ring

various various shenanigans ensued

I won't go into too much detail but in

the chaos Strix disappeared leaving

nothing behind to suggest which went oh

thanks a lot Strix I'm sorry that kind

of threw the waffle crew in a bit of a

tizzy and as they lifted off

d/f took one of his keys and inserted it

into the keyhole worked into the hilt of

his sword

gutter causing a magical aperture to

form before gateway to some distant

plane so that he could summon forth

kamischka the arcane Olaf

and paltin as you recall realized just

you know by his it by himself that he

seems to be shedding skin oh yeah yeah

so where we pick up is the airship is

lifting off out of the great ice rift

since the crew of the ship was killed

the waffle crew is kind of trying to you

know batten things down on their own

Zala you you think you have a ways to go

before these guys will actually be

trained to fly this thing properly

yes I'm just pointing and saying like

move that thing and that other thing

down in the rift below you can see the

dragon that was turned to ice that

evylyn was carving her name into before

she was so rudely interrupted and you

can actually hear the threefold roar of

a really annoyed frost giant who at this

point in time is no longer polymorph but

trapped in a cage much too small for her

body oh yeah alright as the portal opens

up on the deck and your ship continues

to rise suddenly the the cover afforded

to you by the canyon walls no longer is

there and the cold wind of the frigid

Arctic north blows over the ship

catching your hair and your cloaks and

the rigging and just about everything

else I feel nothing you feel nothing

nothing whatsoever hmm yeah you feel

nothing but room temperature forever I

remember what it was like to feel oh my

god and in that moment stepping through

the illuminated plane of the arcane gate

is a fox headed woman her skin covered

with a tawny coat of fur she is wearing

what appears to be a evening ball gown

crimson with gold

and a what would you call it I guess a

headdress or a wreath around her head

made up of what appears to be a tangle

of razor vines that kind of trail down

her back and as she comes forth she has

got what looks like some sort of

cigarette in a cigarette holder

evylyn is like wide-eyed like Oh cuz he

one's never seen her before and she

thinks her fashion is on point

oh that's right you haven't seen her

before

as is paltin because the last time she

master was summoned that DF and Strix

were the only ones present so DF you're

the only one who's met her currently or

the she so surprised teammates this is

something I can do what is going on here

as soon as she comes forth she says I

didn't expect you to summon me so soon

yes explain your girlfriend now

girlfriend oh my gosh dear I was in the

middle of an interrogation no one else

speak this inch shim Eska let's not

mince words to get right to it just like

who's that is that a hint of desperation

I hear in your voice

it is Trix is gone not taken not help

hurt away just gone of her own will what

kind of spell artifact or device could

just take someone away like that she

says of course you're referring to that

be charming young woman that

last time yes that's that's the one

she sort of leans into you a bit and her

eyes sort of fixate on the pendants that

you wear around your neck and she says

is that no may I

I'd rather you didn't she comes toward

you regardless spicy all right she will

she will sort of reveal in one hand what

appears to be like a little magnifying

glass and she holds up to her eye while

the other hand she just sort of pulls it

in toward her and looks at it just hmm

not magical and then she just drops it

and puts her eyepiece away okay yeah

difficult like take it back and like put

it back in its himself and then she says

yes I recall your friend I met her when

she was the child you know it was like

nudging palton like oh no I like her

she's real pretty and she says and I

took the liberty of doing a little

research I believe you believe that it

appears that she has been summoned away

by a contract an infernal contract even

does not like the sound of that you say

she left suddenly yes yes

who would happen to have or wets infer

contract be funny you should mention it

it was sold recently for a song I might

add to one Oh manifests heroin

mm-hmm see I told you it wasn't me d/f

actually like who reacts this name a

little bit it just kind of says out loud

himself Oh been drawn you've met

no not exactly he's just the worst kept

secret of Waterdeep all right

where can I find omen drawn right now or

we're no better yet where's omen drawn

or where is he going

she says he's headed to junked salt D

Ethel turned back to zen dalla son dalla

do you know where child is you do not

but no but artists who is standing on

the deck sort of quietly observing

what's happening around DF he raises up

a gloved hand and says I do would you be

able to navigate us there um he sort of

looks around the ships kind of doing

spinning circles and he says yes all

right yes we'll then turn back to sham

Eska and we'll say two questions

oh really question left

don't look at get box in the mouth yet

all right can I get a rain check on it

well that's all of your questions yeah

no keys

yes roses eyes takes out his key ring

and latches one of the kings and keys

and hands it over and she says I've

always liked your family so bright that

light within you cotta

yeah don't talk about that you're ready

to leave now she says do you really want

to find her I mean you have a new

sorcerer now and she points to Jean

dalla

don't ever question my Moto's it again

this transaction is complete

she will she'll smile and bare her teeth

that you sort of an unspoken threat you

assume and she says one lost friend

isn't the end of the world you know and

then she backs into the portal and she

says beware the Schism they're coming

for you your girlfriend is real weird

she's not my girlfriend I hate her stop

after yeah after she disappears I walk

over a DF I just had tap him on the

shoulder and like man their phrasing

could have gotten you to more questions

but I could see why you wouldn't want to

know anything like where's Eve ones body

now

like how how could he would not become

any more that yeah like when she's not

nip it n't was that she's not evident

how many keys you have left no 6 I

believe he's left I know she just seems

no last thing oh just you know oh yeah

but she seems nice

sandala turns to artists and like grabs

him and says you need to give me the

ring

now and I will give it back to you when

we get to child otherwise we'll just

kill you right now

he says I've told the Harper's this many

times

the ring is evil and it will try to take

control of whoever wears it and use that

person to inflict as much carnage and

destruction as possible others have

tried to control it and failed I'm not

prepared to give it to you particularly

since I don't think who you you are who

you say you are but you're hanging on to

the ring and you were just found ruining

a whole Giants village and you're not

being evil by the ring like I'm not

seeing the logic here he says I've had

the ring for many many years and been

able to control it when none others can

but you're not doing a Harper's job

anymore so I need to take it from you

because it is my job this isn't an

option and who set you on this course to

find me in the ring the Harper's do you

have not been talking to them that's why

you're I still have a few tens among the

Harper's and they've had some things to

say about you oh really all right well

then I guess neither of us are telling

the truth apparently and the waffle

crews gonna have to decide whose side

we're taking here I think because I'm

not letting you keep it

look fine Politan could have the ring

and everyone will be happy yes I could

not agree with anything more please

also you know he's dealt with the whole

influence by evil thing and he's done a

real good job so far he didn't get

married to that weird zombie lady and he

didn't become the Dark Lord and he never

really abandoned that's not really yeah

oh yeah oh come on you know you lose

little right you're a better person than

you like to let on

Kirk shakes her head so ya see problem

problem solved mmm yep iceberg please

you don't see artists going out of his

way to remove the ring he's wearing

gloves on his hands currently so if he's

got the ring on it's under one of them

he just sort of leans up against the

mast post and crosses his arms and says

before I was able to regain the ring the

frost giants were going to try to use

its power to freeze the world I don't

know if they actually could or not

that's beside the point but there are

other groups after this ring the same

harem have you ever heard of them yeah

they're a group that's after the ring

and we're not gonna let them move so

there's that plus you need me to get the

child I won't help you if you take the

ring can I uh can I do like a persuasion

check on him yeah what are you gonna say

to persuade him or do to persuade him

I'm gonna I'm gonna look at him mm-hmm

gonna give him a big ol smile

like yeah you are

come on go ahead and make it roll 25

very very much so

alright to do he will put his arm around

you and kind of turn you and walk you

toward the bow of the ship were you in a

way that suggests he wants to have a

private conversation with you oh my god

I know where this is you know I tried

first let me give you the ring in the

arm hits arm hits me I'm just like

[Laughter]

alright he he says to you I think we're

on the same side here and I do want to

accommodate you but I do have to warn

you that the ring is extremely

persuasive and it was a fight to assert

control over it and it has not come

without cost my efforts to keep the ring

out of Evil's hands has claimed many a

life and some of those lives are on my

shoulders now I found out about the ring

from a place called the eye of the

all-father have you heard of it I

believe that is that the place where you

got the ring although it's it's an

Oracle an ancient talking giant Oracle

locked away in the spine of the world

mountains and the Oracle told me the

path I needed to walk to reclaim the

ring from the frost giants but it also

told me that I would run into allies

along the way

allies within which enemies were hiding

I don't believe you're one of the

enemies I think you're one of the allies

and I think we could be good friends if

we - if you let me travel with you and

see you safely to this land where you

can find your lost friend give me that

chance to get to know you better and

determine whether or not the ring will

be safe in your hands and whether you

will be safe with it then I will

consider parting with it and I will give

it to you would you be willing to wait

you you seem you seem like like you know

I'm and I don't have a great read on you

yet so I'm just gonna go ahead

yeah let's wait let's wipe this out oh

he says in the meantime I would keep a

close eye on your captain's on dala the

last I heard she was no longer a member

of the Harper's this is information I

got from a man named crawlin Val Haro

who runs moon gleam tower in Everland it

is the largest Harper stronghold in the

North mmm and I trust his words over

hers mm-hmm it sounds like a lot of

names and information that I should be

writing down that guy said he says is

there is there's another among your crew

who you trust above all others probably

someone who would write this stuff down

that's that's kind of what I'm getting

at if you could pick if you would pick

one among them in whom I should also

confide which one would you choose I'd

say uh let's see

one of them's gone one of them is one of

them is the one you see you can see now

the cameras are sort of panning from

Paul's point of view and he's like

looking at DF

and he's looking at that he's looking at

the albear Benny's looking at yeah it's

it's between the edgy fellow the one who

summoned the fiend from God knows where

I mean when you say it like yeah I'd say

anyone in my part might and in the group

is trustworthy enough well we can't all

have good judgment and here you started

possible you just sort of Pat's you on

the back and it says it's okay you know

we all have our gifts it's called no

it's pretty much it's pretty much

drowned out by the ripping wind that's

blowing over everything and but you can

tell just by their posture that they're

bonding on some level or at least

they're trying to but you don't you

don't see it's very clear that heartless

isn't like taking his ring off and

handing it to palton right yeah okay

well is there a conversation like done

it looks like it they're just sort of

standing awkwardly next to each other

wind blowing through their head house

other things I also want to remind

everyone that the crew here's my here's

my since they're not here anymore

I just want to be upfront with everybody

and say yes I was working for the

Harper's but this jerk on it crew I got

they were working for somebody else and

I had no means of travel no way of

getting up here and this red dragon guy

what's his cloud yes he trusted me and

wanted the ring for himself as well I

don't know what he plans to do with it

but that's why I have the ship that's

why we had the

Kru that's why that sending stone was

super important to keep out of their

hands so that Klaus didn't get any

information that we didn't want him to

have but now he's on his way and he said

three days he's gonna find us so I don't

know if anybody's got great ideas mr.

artist do you do you have any plans for

this because whether you help us or not

he's coming for it he says I will do

whatever it takes to keep the ring out

of his grasp how far away is chalten

then he says how big is this dragon

nervously and then in 20th interjects

artist says it's a long long trip

thousands thousands of miles south of

here it lies I think it's great how

seriously y'all take the planning phase

of everything we do but Rick's got

summoned by an infernal contract if

she's incheol and we need to go right

now and find her couldn't say it better

evylyn whatever preparations we need to

do whatever training need to give us to

get this ship going let's do it yeah and

artists will sort of leave paltin side

and come toward the rest of the party

and just say now alt is if you want to

talk about the end of the world

salt is the end of the world it is a

remote corner of faire une a vast

peninsula of uncharted wilderness and

the world yes we're going right now

she's like running to that bow she's

like what thing do I push

Jean dalla what do I she's like at the

harpoon what do I do

agreed we are going to find Strix that

is the most important thing on the table

here but artists how do we know you're

not just gonna like ring bird away from

here and leave us I have no guarantees

you're sticking around right now that's

right you don't but

as I've told my friend paltin here I was

guided on this mission by an Oracle and

I was warned that I would run into some

allies and I believe that this meeting

is not by chance but by fate I have a

history and Scheldt which maybe one day

I'll regale you with but for the time

being suffice to say I do have a purpose

there and so I am strongly motivated to

stay with you as long until we arrive

evylyn takes her construct hand and

clamps it around his wrist it's like

look friendship motivation not going

anywhere

now let's go she just hold onto his hand

stubbornly for into perpetuity okay he

doesn't pull away or anything but he

does he sort of looks down at you a sort

of quizzical look like he hasn't he

hasn't really gotten a good look at you

up to this point last he saw you you

were doing something really weird to

that dragon and yeah he'll just stand

there and let you clasp his arm and all

right looking and pulling ropes and

stuff while I'm holding on to his arm

with the other hand yeah yeah let's get

this boat moving and I guess we'll deal

with this dragon whenever he finds us if

he hopefully he just doesn't artists

will say how how is he gonna find us do

you know that I don't know that actually

I don't think there's a way he can find

us I'm stone thing is like a beacon

unless you plan to communicate with him

some more maybe you should get rid of it

that's fine and I check it over the side

finally a quick quick question Chris so

I didn't really touch on this but that

play flesh that came off me yeah yeah

that's still thing yeah okay just making

sure

mm-hmm when that when that happened I I

did that thing where I took it off and

then you know that situation where like

you have like a napkin or something but

there's no like garbage in your vise you

have like

I'll just throw this out later

oh my god

hope that doesn't come back to bite me

all right is there any like mark visible

on his neck nobody has noticed anything

at this point in time other than paltin

and he hasn't announced anything so no

[Laughter]

all right so you spend the next little

while basically doing what captain's

Angela asks you to do so you can get a

handle for how to fly this thing who all

is participating in the flying of the

ship all right yes

yep yep Paul Turner you are you

considering yourself one of the crew or

you're going to try to stay out of the

the ladies I am needed they will they

will almost certainly need you they need

a minimum crew for now well with you

that makes three artists is happy to

help but so is sir Godfrey your undead

night so you could

palton if you want stay out of it and

let them take you do I count too

can I work while I'm Yellin uh yeah I

guess you could you could substitute for

one of the crew as well okay I help out

to forum okay we can leave Godfrey or

whoever doesn't want to help I like I

like go to volunteer and then I feel

that mmm-hmm missing flesh I'm like you

know guys I'll probably just get away I

mean it's drunk again right I'm gonna go

sleep all right so go if you want to

help that way death can just stand on

the bow their ship looking straight

forward arms crossed and just brooding

the whole trip you should play it the

song Politan yo and played and so long

feel I can't continue to work unless I

have

all right go to like reach for the new

Mandal and I'm just like okay oh God

Oh fault in like struggling and I say

why don't you stand at the front and

keep watch

yeah I'm gonna stand at the front and

keep watch you're so helpful thing down

anytime Sam are you gonna are you gonna

try to play at all yeah I'll just like

okay I like pluck around all right you

just sort of pluck around and when

you're out on the bow it's particularly

cold out there and your fingers start to

get kind of numb and your bones start to

ache and you feel pain sort of shooting

through every time you strum on the lute

it becomes more intolerable now when I

give him my cloak or something you could

or or you could let him sit near the

furnace on deck which puts out heat

whatever you want

palton I mean it is cool if you want to

like keep watch cuz that's yeah but you

can drape is you can drink your your

cool cloak over his shoulders like I

think I have like some kind of cold

resistance yeah because of my drew conic

thing make a perception check of zone

dollar where is that that would be no I

don't have any perception it would just

be a wisline and just be listing for you

okay you throw see you rolled a one

I made a one alright the first script

fail goes to the guest star yes okay

you notice nothing untoward as you kind

of drape your cloak over his shoulders

and paltin you're sitting there with the

cloak on feeling better now that you're

kind of on a stool next to the furnace

and there's heat kind of issuing off of

it by the way it's real fancy yeah sir

sir Godfrey is not troubled by the cold

being a revenant and neither is evylyn

but evylyn as you are working

and paltin is inspiring you with his

little plucks on his mandolin you can

hear juniper rattling around in your

innards probably because it's like an

ice box in there now oh yeah yeah and

you hold her in your ice-cold

woody hands like he's drunk again

do you like mice mice do you mind

holding on to Jennifer she's real cold I

can't warm her up

I said juniper next to summarize

whatever summarizes they can just hang

out together and they like each other

like do they seem like they're they're

gonna be friends

let's check that's Chris um our wives

summer wise eats juniper like sangala

just offer you this treat to to

summarize and summarize just with the

snap of the jaws and then you see the

little hind end of the mouse with the

tail sticking out and the tail goes down

its gullet I don't want you to get a

telepath summer wise and I say oh my god

and then he sort of look at you with the

prize I need you to spit it out now hmm

please I will get you an apple you like

way tastier make a persuasion check with

advantage do I see this oh yeah all

right

yeah he'll he'll take his stare put it

on his tongue and just start to

regurgitate and spits up a wet slimy

white mouse which just sort of goes to

flop on in your hands yeah you do little

resuscitation and yes little breaths

return to junipers form you are not a

very good babysitter I thank you -

Rebecca Mike thanks anyway and then

going okay dad can you don't do anything

mean to her she's been through a lot of

course I'll take juniper and

Placer those cabins are all free now I

wonder I wonder scratch or scratch me up

a lot and I'll take one of my one of my

pouches I normally hold so my coinage

two things are yeah kind of put her and

there's a little sleeping bag and then

if she still seems cold I'll put it by

the furnace or right seems to help that

seems to okay yeah I don't know why I

didn't do that in the first place you're

the responsible one Diaz Wow close call

oh my god

that rat is her mouse is going to be

resuscitated like gonna be like a zombie

Mouse good good work on that persuasion

check that was key they would never

forgive you what is he's being held on

to I'm holding on to him still I'm

dragging him around yeah I guess that's

what he's doing mostly he seems to just

be kind of watching and currently

shaking his head I decided the artist

looks exactly like a long-haired oh god

no I'm blinking what's his name Nicholas

Cage

yeah and actually the arts for him and I

know I don't know if you can actually I

can't hold a book close enough for you

to see clearly but there is I'm sure I

can see that once I go out and purchase

two of anihilation now there we go

yep that's your local game store sick

plug and

evil and you can see cuz you've been

around artists now for a little bit but

he's he doesn't carry any big weapons or

anything other than a dagger that he's

got on his belt that is kind of

interesting in a way because it's got a

tiny little spider worked into the

pommel not a real spider but a carving

of a spider and I like spiders there's

also a it has the the body of the spider

looks like a blue gem that's real pretty

where'd you get that is that a spider I

like spiders do you like fine he says

that's my dagger bookmark it's called

wide bookmark what does bookmarks have

to do with spiders do you like to read

yeah I mean don't you yeah sure I love

to read especially about Lysander the

morning lord have you heard of a king of

the morning

oh praise glory be to his name just a

little bit you want

quietly cackling so I would look for

more about Lysander the morning Lord

evens like just hear a voice explain

like feel for the distance as the

airship flies away from the camp

[Laughter]

all right so sangala

I would like you to make another roll

seems like you got all the rolls today

this is going to be a wisdom survival

check and this is a roll to determine

how well your training is taking hold of

the crew well you trained us I'm

checking your captaincy here yeah

because anybody can pull a rope when

they're told to but you're the one who

has to give them the orders to do things

in the proper order 14 plus 6 okay very

good

so within the span of a day you kind of

get them doing things in the right flow

you're able to raise and lower the ship

to get into currents that carry you in

the right directions you know that

without you they'll have a hard time

finding currents and get going in the

right direction themselves but they're

able to do the rudimentary tasks needed

to get the ship going in the right

direction at full speed all right and

then as time wears on you can see

fatigue setting in they've been doing it

for hours and hours and hours now

normally you have a bit of a crew

rotation now you have with you and D F

and Evelyn and Godfrey working together

as a foursome you could swap out two and

let them rest

Godfrey doesn't need to rest neither

does evil and technically so I feel fine

I'm gonna keep telling them all about

Lysander but you I was gonna say I need

long rest because I'm still at s'right

point here at like single digits 20 I

think oh that's why you got to lay on

hands from your lamb hands right yeah I

also wouldn't mind a full rest at some

point since I was blasted down by a

white dragon's breath attack

alright so sangala who do you want to

place in command while you rest I

actually still need to go into like my

powered down state to get my spells

that's correct okay I guess I have to I

guess I could tell you more about what

theater tomorrow artist I I kind of want

to talk to the crew about this and be

like hey guys so I think me and Diaz are

gonna rest first but like what are we

gonna do about artists I still don't

trust him

and evylyn obviously needs to work with

probably both hands so should we like

tie him somewhere or I don't know like

we're screwed if he weaves he's not

leaving he said so himself he needs to

make his way to chalta but at least two

of us up here we can keep eye on him

okay um artists also took some damage

from the altercation so he's a little

battered right now yeah he does maybe

maybe he'd let us hold bookmark his

dagger that he loves very much what

collateral I'm just saying he would

probably let us artists would you let me

hold that thing it was really nice all

right well I guess all we have is two he

says I use it to cut my food that's why

we can cut the food for you dude okay

you don't need to be like all hard-ass

here but if you're gonna earn utensils I

like more than other oh my goodness okay

so I guess I'm putting evylyn in charge

because paltin is like chillin yep so

alright so he ones in charge and also

don't

asks God for you can stay up here and

work if you and deaath are going bottom

side then you need paltin and artists to

be working ok ok paltin are you cool

with that also artists you're gonna work

I don't care if you're cool with that I

will do something ok whichever job

requires the least attention yeah

alright okay so when DF and Jean dolla

you retire belowdecks on dollar you've

got your own cabin deaath you can make

happen with a couple hammocks in it and

take one I'll find a comfortable place

for juniper and give her a little bit

all right back back ins and ellas Kevin

you can see summer wise is still a bit

miffed that you gave him food and then

took it away he's being very aloof right

now I don't I don't recognize all right

not particularly I'm gonna say waffles

and Simon are probably just like like

partners yeah yeah waffles is probably

just sleeping on the deck he's she's not

bothered by the cold at all cuz he's got

her huge coat Simon isn't bothered by

the cold so he's just kind of like he

might be just sort of standing there

Thorin and occasionally will like go

over and stand next to paltin or find

something that he can like juggle okay

okay so we nap well long rest all right

yay paulsen make a constitution saving

throw for me sure

it'd be a 17 okay while you're aware

that you're you feel somewhat weakened

and whatnot

it doesn't really impede your ability to

do the minimal amount of work necessary

to keep the ship moving as you've been

instructed so use up you don't suffer

any debilitating effects other than the

cold does get to you and the pain

there's never subsides but fortunately

there's Simon there to give you

occasional laugh with his capering and

antics so that's kind of nice

I kneel down to Simon yep I just put my

hands on your shoulders mm-hmm it's like

my sock I don't know how much longer I

have on this world if I'm gone I need

you to watch the wine and also a friends

that friends are nice too naeli the wine

you get it he will not I shake him like

I mean it can you do this

you know it's franticly you're a good

boy stolen I don't think everyone trusts

you he looks around he does out sort of

a 360 with his head on the deck of the

ship looks around sees waffles he's

Godfrey and he just sort of kind of

shrugs his shoulders he does a 360 turn

I'm just like and like that doesn't

help I believe in you make sure you

study I heard something I don't know

what kids do it'll just sort of look

around from side to side and figure out

what where this is all coming from and

then I'll just sort of hold his hands up

to hug you where son I like go over to

hug him and I feel okay I'm like yep

he's a good boy boy making make

perception check evylyn here it comes

hey okay you get really into this whole

system of dealing with the rigging and

moving the ship along on its course and

barking out orders I'm making metaphors

about Lysander has the knot ties

together then to that time so are we

inextricably tied to the light of the

morning Lord in our daily lives

all right and paltin make a perception

check 17 all right as you confide in

Simon

you notice that evens going off on one

of her religious tangents and but you

catch sight of or you sort of meet eyes

with artists who is helping to guide the

ship but has on his face as he looks at

you sort of a look of grave concern like

he you sense that he is aware that

something is amiss with you

I like Oh specifically with me yeah

there's sort of a pitied look to it what

as I was like having like this is really

yes moment with my son yes I just look

over like still crouched down just like

[Laughter]

all right he goes back to work like so

he won't make anything of it okay

when time passes as Angela and DF you

wake up in your due time

nothing nothing untoward has happened

and you can have your breakfast and then

go up to see how everyone else is doing

everything is just as you left it pretty

much except now it's daytime great the

morning the morning the morning light is

gleaming off of evylyn as she's standing

up on the rigging and pulling lines and

tying things off and you can see artists

artists is actually standing next to the

furnace and is just sort of warming

himself in stamping his feet right oh

god Bobby for he doesn't seem at all

bothered by the cold as soon as I

arrived topside I basically look over

for Weber position I need to take over

for ya or whatever is on dalla directs

me to okay I imagine either paltin or

evil and since they need to never either

sure make a perception check death yay I

get to roll 23 palton does not look well

you can see that he looks sick like he

is really really sick looking he's lost

some color in his flesh and he's moving

like kind of a old version of himself

let me approach to him say hey buddy

want you want you to take it take it

easy so cool touch me and with your roll

and when you get close to him you can

see that there are some like black veins

coming up his neck

halten I got this once you once you go

see even for a second it's motion

sickness I don't like boats

okay I mean if you're not feeling well I

think I feel great all right all right

well just just go get some rest I got

this all right paulten do you retire

below decks where it's warm and there is

like hammocks and hell sure okay

all right I'll be powering down for a

while

yeah yeah go log off you did good she's

gonna do like exactly where she is

all right hey um nevermind okay artists

watches you as he stamps his feet next

to the furnace is Angela he doesn't look

ready to go back to his post yet but

he's just watching it very carefully

um I say to artists why are you cold I

mean like doesn't the ring you're not

wearing the ring are you not currently

knew it so I make sure I say this loud

enough that everybody knows he's not

wearing the ring currently just because

it puts me at ease and he can't fly off

on a bird of ice and I want everyone to

know this okay so I feel better now

do I hear from below he's not wearing

the ring No everybody was empowered down

on the deck so DF basically okay I heard

it yeah

heard it Godfrey : heard it summarize

hear it yep Juniper heard it know she's

down below and she's down below oh she's

okay alright so who's who's on deck now

that would be you DF Godfrey artists

cool and and technically sleeping or

resting evylyn gotcha okay yep all right

we're still you are several days pass

let's say seven and you've got a system

in place now but it's become

increasingly apparent to all of you over

that time that palton is not well I've

probably tried laying on hands on this

decaying flesh was in the bed before I

got here and Paul Bolton your maximum

hit points have decreased by another

seven

oh that's really bad cool he was

grabbing D s by the shoulders and she's

like the fax lady you have fax the Fox

lady what to do we have to heal him I

bet she knows how guys it's fine it's a

it's a face and then like this before

could it be flying are you allergic to

flying yeah guys we need to land right

away oh yeah I think I think he just

needs to chill until we can get to child

then we'll seek out a doctor artists

will say at this point he's not gonna

make it to child I don't know with that

attitude I'm nice immediately after as I

like throw up some toys oh I might

need that a piece of my tongue so I say

to artists so you guys are like all

buddy-buddy and you had this whole thing

worked out right when about giving him

the ring when you get to chill and you

don't think he's gonna make it now

pretty much I've been watching I've been

watching him just like we all have he's

not doing well what do you know about

this have you seen this before have I

seen this before no what you're speaking

like you know something if you know

something spit it out yeah he says well

let me put it this way I'm a lot older

than I look and I've seen a lot of

things I've seen magical curses I've

seen other kinds of decay I've seen

encounters with undead do horrible

things to people and what he's going

through now at the rate he's falling

apart

I don't think given the distance we

still have to go that he's going to be

in one piece by the time we get there

how much farther away is child based on

my estimations we're still a month's

journey away a month

well this isn't the fastest vessel but

we wouldn't get there any faster

traveling by a ship did I mention that

child is literally at the end of the

world

Evelyn's kind of like staring at paulten

and kind of narrowing her eyes and like

kind of thinking and she tries to do it

and she's like you noticed that that

clean line right across his neck there

Wow

standing right here but actually you're

probably wondering why he's been wearing

high collars and like things around him

would look kind of like that when you

had a bruise on around your neck right

now death is going through this internal

turmoil where he's like looking out the

directions are going knowing that strix

is currently in chomp at the 30 days

away and then back at palton who was

dying in front of them and not sure

which one to stop and help

there is a black flame that erupts on

the deck of the ship and it's momentary

and it leaves behind an oily smoke that

coalesces into the form of strix do I

see this or you all you all see this at

some point or you're all aware very

quickly that Strix is returned as

quickly as she left at point I'm just

like what a well timed event

push the plot along now Strix you have

all your experiences and knowledge of

what you went through recently you don't

know how much you know how much time has

passed in your world which is about

seven days since the time you first

arrived on the other airship right I'm

just gonna I'm just like look around and

see everyone and just say I won the

dinosaur race

are you cool it was a so long story

short it was an infernal contract and

omen had it opens really nice Jim's an

 just cease and be always very

nice he got me a new hat their new

friends I like hold my hat

I turned to everybody and I'm like so is

she like completely crazy or not what

actually so she's this really happened

and I'm more barmy than crazy but yes it

happened I was gone okay jack

oh I was in Schultz that's where I was

it was jungle you are in child yeah I

was really hurt going what a coincidence

Joffrey glad you're back safe and sound

so I'll inform about all that stuff

about the contract and all of that and

necessary all of what all the contract

is my Mike bad you were finding out a

little bit but actually for the nobody

knows anything so you have to actually

okay that's right that's right

yes uh-oh also Jim was the the mean what

was dying

I guess there's there's like a curse

going on it's a death curse huh weird

I'll look over to Colton and I'm

guessing I can see that he looks similar

before it's clear that he looks a lot

worse than he did the last time you saw

him like a finger falls off so I run up

districts and I say so do you know how

to fix it no good

a ser Iraq is behind it and their intial

it's called the sole monger that's it a

soul longer that's what they're called

that is a lot more information than we

had before so thank you didn't we

am I remembering incorrectly that we

knew that this was the curse affecting

Strix and DF before yeah yeah yeah van

Rycke controlled us as much yeah but Dad

you recall at that when you evylyn used

the blessing of markovia to free yeth

and Strix from the effects of the curse

at that point in time you weren't

concerned about palton because palton

hadn't died but of course your recent

excursion to burrow via changed all of

that

of course Strix and DF were still

protected but palton not so much you

guys get the birds I sent you sent you

birds but notes no well I tried I was

thinking about you all that's real

thoughtful of you

we we're sorry we lost you it wasn't

your fault they just have that contract

that I told you about I mean who knows

just hope my family doesn't come back

cuz that'd be real bad

so yeah they can't they can't do it

again can they oh I mean I I asked him

to destroy the contract but I think he

said a contract and I feel like Obon

smarter than me I don't think that's

possible you're real smart Strix thank

you but I count on my fingers well I'm

glad to see you're okay glad you're safe

and back good to see you

strips will give DF a weird hand touch

evylyn is like using like a bit of sale

or something to try to scrub all the

black oily smoke her that she got from

she's like smiling but she's like

obviously like I asked Strix do you need

a long rest we already have a system

figured out and we're willing to let you

have the time you need to recover before

we incorporate you and okay

am i okay Chris yeah you're pretty much

as you were when you wrapped up the the

business with the Oh God

you haven't even told him about the

Tyrannosaurus Rex Triceratops thing I'll

tell them that after I have a drink

strict I'll steal some Paulson's wine

and my father was a Tyrannosaurus and

then an ancient but I cast death Lord on

him which was the spell he didn't have

and then he pretended to spell it and

then he was okay and I saved in life but

he didn't care and he already at once we

almost got sucked into it

Triceratops but during the race and it

was really gross do we know what

dinosaurs are yeah you have an inkling

of what they are but we've never seen

one no and we don't know that they are

on earth or we do you know that they are

creatures of this world I just assumed

they were fake but yes there's some

there's some belief in they may not be

around anymore or they could just be a

myth because if they exist they don't

exist anywhere in the lands that you

have lived in getting sucked into a

Tyrannosaurus but sounds disgusting

I was the it was the it was the

Triceratops he was eaten by the

Tyrannosaurus and I had to climb inside

of it to take him out of it

yeah you know they were just they asked

me to do a lot of questionable things

but I survived so you know I'm glad to

be back

they have very different lives than us

well do you remember how to do that

ritual thing because maybe I just have

to die again no no no no we have to kill

the soul monger that's what we have to

do and I think they're trying to too

since I left that was there they wanted

there so they're on their way

and paltin we don't have time to find

and kill a soul monitor he's wasting

away before our very eyes

well we might have time to find

something else to help him like magic

vixen go go go magic palton come here

emotion Paulding over and I'm gonna take

off my glove mmm

and then remove the ring I've been

wearing the ring of protection yeah and

give it to Paul the one that's been

infused with evil in soul and then give

it to paltin and have him put it on okay

so he slides his magic ring onto your

finger paltin the one of the fingers in

fall off

he slides on family really oh my gosh I

wasn't ready for this yeah and paltin

you feel just sort of instinctively that

the ring has to attune to you um so it's

gonna take a few minutes before it does

then you'll benefit from its power

essentially whatever that may be because

you've learn who's already protected us

maybe you can protect him too what about

you dad

well I'm okay everyone was watching him

very closely to make sure he stays okay

okay about 10 minutes later palton is

able to attune to the ring and it being

a ring of protection Politan it

increases your armor class by one which

isn't bad and then in addition you also

get a +1 bonus to all of your saving

throws which would include death saving

throws by the way cool yep well there's

no once he's attune to the ring you

don't see any instantaneous

transformation no maybe I'll prevent

further decay I'm not sure just you

Dylan helped us I just think she

could've helped you too you think the

answer here is we need to find a quicker

way to child because I mean that ring

might help but this sounds like

something way bigger than that so you

know how many like portals around here

or Strix we'll start digging through her

robes like maybe with something

trying to get out this good portal key

bottle in your purse

alright and Strix over the next day or

two you can regale them with all the

details about how you were summoned to

an airship which looks surprisingly like

this one oh yeah yeah I will I will tell

them about how they're called Oh like

what they are acquisition incorporated

and I will make sure to tell DX about

how they were from water deep and blah

blah blah and hopefully he'll if you

might know so little recognizes on Bella

you know of a few details about how this

ship came to be you were told when you

became captain by Klaus that and by the

way you haven't seen clouds so maybe

checking away the sending stone was a

great idea

the that Klaus saw an airship like this

fly over his domain and someone aboard

the ship threw money off the ship at the

dragon to appease God and that was

forever sort of ingrained in Klaus

memory and Klaus said about the task of

building one for himself so enamoured

was he of the vessel and so this is this

is the inspiration that he got after

that brief encounter with another

airship yours is a knocking yeah

too real a non branded non branded a

generic oh my god materials is just

cheaper fortunately I Clark has a really

good eye for detail so he was it

deconstructed with his big dragon brain

but um yes the fact that you haven't

seen Klaus means that you may have

confounded him great idea guys I don't

remember who had that idea I said you

said that a day has passed and when

another day passes

palton you don't feel like you've gotten

worse oh dear yes I don't feel like I've

gotten worse what yeah if you feel like

you have gotten worse alright check it

out what if we just like swap the Rings

like really

really fast d/f your hit point maximum

goes down by one so do we think that we

can make a schedule of everyone who

needs protection and hopefully gets a

jolt in time before you're all dead that

sound like a plan

well we have two rings so we can switch

somebody junior I didn't know that I

have one as well and I'm willing to give

mine up to anyone that needs it so all

my friends have to slowly die around me

I mean we're all gonna be in the dead

book anyway so it really doesn't make a

difference just how quickly we get there

but yes we just could we just call it

van rycke din he can do a nice another

little markovia thing I never thought

I'd heard you say yeah you believe you

believe evil and that the blessing of

Saint markovia was spent in that

endeavor evil never believed anything is

spent

I was a one-time gift

all right well palton you could take my

ring right now because I haven't decayed

at all it's Sarah mentally so I do I do

I still have the the ring I was given

yeah you have but you have des currently

yeah okay

and you're attuned to it now so JC does

anyone know any way of speeding up the

ship or finding a different way there

cuz the faster we can take care of a

CEREC the better we're all better agreed

and they don't we've got the air

elemental that makes us go up the fire

elemental makes you go up the fire

elemental makes you go up the elemental

moves you forward propulsion so if the

air is thinner up there baby will have

less drag and if we know your fastest

route is to basically catch a current

going in the direction you want to go

and you get extra thrust from the air

elemental when you're in that current

okay you are you are currently you are

currently moving the ship as fast as you

can

okay I was gonna say I thought we were

already doing that so feel good

we nuke a little yeah I'm gonna need a

portal in here I'm gonna look at D if

and also like take my ring off and just

be like put it on

hey that Fox came through report all

right that's not the same thing I mean

it could maybe it sorry for trying to

help geez hey it looked like a portal to

me yeah it's just it was in fact no

girlfriend she was very nice sir Sasuke

will say dealing with things as

dangerous yes oh is dying that is

absolutely true I mean do you have any

other idea because I'm fresh out but

something that happened last time I

wasn't here she bite you or something no

she was very nice

quite genteel and she wore a very pretty

outfit I wouldn't I'd say it's a little

much but you know not fan I mean if we

call this fox lady she's not gonna let

us get in her portal with her and even

then we don't know where her portal goes

she might have the power to open one I

thought she was like a

question-answering

type person not like gay she provides

information not yeah drivers not a

transport device we might be able to

offer her something for a favor I mean

that's a bad idea I know it's a bad idea

there maybe she knows how we could do it

oh yeah we can open the portal dad do

you know how to open a portal strikes

yeah I've done that

it's it's specific short-range yeah

can you call up this omen fella and just

ask him last thing we need is a debt to

him she said he was nice it was nice and

I was also Jim jerk I was also a

prisoner so I mean that niceness is it's

you know you see it comes with the price

I guess it'll come on deep just some

just Summoner come on let's just get out

it like it's just do it damn it I hate

this I'll take out a writ I'll take out

a key where did it go number six okay

a portal opens and out steps

shemesh go once more you can see that

she's about her razor vine tiara but she

has switched dresses at this point and

is wearing a a black almost sort of

scholarly robe that drape goes all the

way down to the floor and she's got

basically a gleaming ring a gem

encrusted ring on every finger and on

both of her thumbs extra ok death ask

her if there's any way she knows we can

get to childlike ASAP all right

Mashka yeah

honey how can I help you my boy what's

the fastest way that Schultz and that we

can obtain you said this world is Torah

yes that's not line distrix us from the

corner she's kind of hiding behind a box

well it's very simple you just have to

find a wizard to cast the teleport spell

for you table izing all our friends so

ask her about stabilizing all her

friends yes yes thank you yeah thank you

you have too many but you have two

questions left a Sarah act a soul monger

currently during a life force everyone

who's died causing a sort of death curse

so you told me how can we prevent the

effects of the death curse I'm so glad

you asked and she pulls out a scroll and

she says and out of her bosom she pulls

a vial of what looks like purplish

liquid and she hands them both to you I

anticipated your request and she says if

you use these to create scroll you can

summon forth a night hag coven called

the sown sisters allow them to visit you

three times in three nights and they

will give you something each time while

you sleep

you must accept all three and at the end

you will be protected should your soul

be trying to if if the soul monger is

going to try to steal your soul this

will protect you once oh I like that

plan she's so nice isn't she nice

Alton anyway it's like so you're telling

me that the only way to survive is to

let some ladies show up in the night

while I'm sleeping and do whatever they

want I really don't see a problem with

this plan okay so the last question I

think needs to be where is the nearest

wizard with a portal I mean like artists

isn't a wizard is he anyone on the boat

reminds wizards aren't as skilled as

sorcerers I think that's totally true

well she did show wizard work spell yeah

I was gonna say well I made the teleport

spell if we if we follow this

instructions there was this peg or

whatever on palton and his death curse

is prevented then we don't need to worry

about getting there as fast I just it's

true I like to have two plans though but

if there's another question you'd rather

ask her right now go for it

within child where can we find a ser

iraq soul monger she says

Oh Oh Moo I went there that's a good

question does she even know at this

point in time yeah I think she probably

knows something um she says the sole

monger and Sarah are not together be

specific which one you want to find the

sole one the sole one sole monger he

says I have it on good authority it's

hidden under the city of omou I was

strict you know where that is dinosaur

was all right well we have somebody on

board that knows how to get there I

don't know how to get there but I mean I

can maybe I do maybe I was smart enough

to remember mm-hmm let's hope an artist

will walk up behind UDF and just say in

low tones and he's not hiding it from

anybody certainly not from shemekka

but he says I think she might be a

wizard

mr. Mishka yeah you're quite powerful

[Music]

let's let's make a deal yes what what

can I offer to you if you have the

ability to do so to get us to a child as

fast as possible say instantaneously if

I have the ability you insult me there's

not my intention

fortunately I came prepared for that

question too and she says my I'll be

happy to teleport you there my boy and

all of your friends and all I ask in

return is that you subject yourself

willingly to a gayest spell what's that

oh yeah what is that

greatest of all magical compulsions need

and I'll spoil the surprise for you I

have learned that one of my old comrades

the colleague of sorts might be

somewhere down there in Oh Moo he has

something that belongs to me

uh-huh and something else I desire his

name well he goes by the name mr. Fox

and antastic I want his spectacles and

the spell book he took from my library a

book and some glasses that's easy-peasy

what does the spell do though

if he accepts the gays

he must complete the tasks given before

him he's been through enough no strict I

think you've been through enough with

her task is just to get a book she looks

at strikes and says oh you returned

brace yourself dearie your life is gonna

get very harsh watch it was already bad

it's not very nice that's not nice

I'm just delivering a friendly warning

but he should hurt had sent back to you

death then she says what is it going to

be let me guess

this guess the instructions you just

want me to return this mr. Fox and his

spectacles and your spell book back to

you that's all you want that will be the

terms of the gayest yes get those things

for me and I will teleport you all to

child yet you don't have to do this we

can wait we could just call the hags

oh the hags you want to call them anyway

because even if you get to child to the

effects of the death curse we'll still

claim your friends without their

protection I mean I'm not bored for

helping with this book and glasses deal

so I mean I mean death is doing us all a

favor I think we owe it all to pledged

to help get this done I mean and if we

do wait than hundreds of people will

probably die to this soul mongers curse

yes almost certainly thank you evylyn

[Laughter]

saving innocence I'm missing a party I

love parties where is it being held evil

lair

[Laughter]

I'm not sure if this is the worst idea

I've ever done but it's certainly up

there let's do it your Mecca

I've got returned you your items oh

you're not gonna keep the scroll in the

ink oh yeah oh yeah look at those I just

mean the book and the spectacles oh yeah

right there in that case she's the

longest under my word you get

essentially myself

evylyn paltin Strix waffles juniper

Simon I'll look back at everyone else

let's see artists is on dialog Godfrey

[Laughter]

everyone held like turned everyone else

do you guys think these are all nice

artists city of business and Schultz

anyway so yeah but they're already

flying there also he has the ring we

need to get so you can't leave him

behind

oh yes the ring that son Dola needs to

get I don't give a about it as much

as you can from her we're all going lady

I'll turn I'll turn the three of them

and just be like what I look at the

three on just be like do you guys wanna

hurt you're gonna be here I want to help

you with this thing she can take up to

age creatures just so you know Strix

palton

waffles juniper me me hahaha some are

wise

don't let pets count

that's awful yeah there's so many pet

yeah you got you got juniper you off

summer wise you've got Simon you've got

Godfrey and you've got artists there's

six plus your five

Oh putting on her fingers damn it now

you're getting me confused DF paulten

Strix evil in juniper waffles Simon wait

I'm not a creature nope oh nice try

insult yourself you're important what if

the creature fits inside a creature he's

shaking his head no I mean I feel like

it's danger a creature is a creature

even if it's inside another creature

yeah lean towards Godfrey and leave

those to figure out their own problems

Yeah right yeah Godfrey some extra

muscle is that right Godfrey I'm just

happy to help weird about him but yeah

he never did explain why hey big knives

not hurting anyone I appreciate your

hard work never hurts to have a priest

on the morning Lord alone that's right

Cheers

all the time okay in the beginning there

was a lot cuz you never know when Stroud

might show up again I'm sorry

hold on hold up wait I thought that what

he's gone says don't worry don't worry

of that he's gone you said you'll put

him into some sort of doll brought him

into this world I did that yep well so

he's so you're just waiting until he

just shows up like he's gonna show up

he's probably gonna be pissed at you

damn it okay okay

is simon capable of doing anything on

the ship is he capable he has not

exhibited any desire to it's possible he

could but you haven't seen him actually

work right you don't think Simon and

work necessarily or two things that go

together very well I go find juniper in

her nest and I ask her if she wants to

come along to Phil's or not and I check

her over and see whether she seems to be

suffering from any death curse herself

I've just oh that's a very good question

I'm gonna say she wasn't in fact dead so

cuz you were able to revive her with a

lay on hand so yeah she did die when I

died that's true but actually the death

curse only affects humanoids so it's not

even an issue

ha give me out give me out we can't just

take everyone because then we're

basically leaving them stranded without

a crew I mean you could do that nothing

stopping you from just leaving us

I mean possible grudges and vengeance

wouldn't stop me from doing also he's a

nice person and he wouldn't do that

now if even just say oh no someone with

hands like say Simon stayed behind just

to help you know

crew the ship Tilly's get them there are

you trying to separate us from our son

again no I'm trying to make sure that

we're not leaving them to die paulten

are you hearing what I'm look okay so

one thing you do know is Angela is that

you can land the ship without a crew I

mean literally you just have to descend

and that right you could do that

yourself oh cool I'm reading nearby an

establishment where you could just hire

some idiots you have no idea you're so

high up the clouds are below you cool

sounds like you'll be able to find

yourselves midi 'it's yeah okay I

I believe in you to do that we have one

spot left of the eighth

why don't we just bring three things in

dolla and artists have their own things

to handle hey weld up I've been half

paying attention it's hard it is artists

coming I would like if he went you will

be eventually they'll take some time as

they fly the ship over to chop but we

can meet up with him there I wouldn't

normally interject at this point says

artists but I did speak to an Oracle

that said that I would help that I would

come together with others and return to

child it is a place I know pretty well I

can if nothing else serve as a guide

yeah that sounds great

guide with the ring I want yeah he

should come fine right we're taking

artists God artists will cast a smile

over towards and Allah

hey there's lots of spoof Oracle's out

there saying all sorts of things to

people who knows if we're the right

group even can I give artists like a

like a like a bro five and bring it in

for a hug yeah like yeah

[Laughter]

artists artists will just say back to

you we'll see about that all right

so artists then yes I will leave Godfrey

behind to help crew this ship sundial

you can land it wherever and as you're

descending lifting your establishment

make your way there hire some some

bright-eyed young dumb kids who want to

fly an airship for the first time ever

if we can do it they can do it and then

we'll meet with you back in child there

were some on the airship that I was on

and I got one kill rate we're taking

strikes with us for better or worse I

would like to cast dominate person on

artists right now oh all right is on

della casts a spell yeah do I see her

doing that oh yes okay I don't know you

I do know you but stop it none of that

she's casting spell no magic on this

ship unless it's me I'm like looking at

her like okay are you gonna continue

with the casting I continue to cast the

spell an artist all right I tell my

broom to slap her let's roll initiatives

really initiative between the two of you

for starters to see whether or not and

Allah is able to cast the spell before

Strix can interrupt her oh I got it too

[Applause]

now she could come up and slap you but

that doesn't necessarily end the spell

I sent my broom after her okay late

so it's whacking her all right make your

broom attack though I didn't so your

plus four to hit with the broom okay

just roll the die and add four fourteen

that does that actually hits some

Bella's armor class which is third time

so you get whacked by the broom

rolled I think it's a d 4 plus 2 damage

Strix maybe okay and then I needs on

dollar to make a concentration so that's

five damage five damage so some dollar

you have to make a constitution saving

throw a de rol plus here a constitution

modifier that would be your con is plus

two plus two so eleven okay so the DC is

ten or half the damage you take

whichever number is higher so Tenzin

turn alright so you are able to maintain

concentration on the spell despite

getting whacked by the Birman be nice

why are you hitting your friend so she's

doing magic artists all the time a

saving throw versus your save DC of 15 I

don't know what's happening a spell is

being cast on artists that would not got

that you can make an arc on the chick 28

you think it's definitely a charm or

enchanted effect that she is trying to

beguile him with this spell which he is

able to resist with his Constitution 7th

row of 17 all right let us all roll

initiative that's whoa can't we talk

this out precisely

Oh guess who rolled on that twenty all

right what's your total evylyn 2022 how

did Paul to do on his still dying

six-six DF 1818 Strix 1313 and then I'll

roll artists that's great yes sir bones

just like you you kids have fun

Oh Godfrey and Osan dalla

you can also telepathically since

summarize technically acts on your turn

you can telepathic we give him commands

to do things too okay so just so you

know yeah all right and Simon will act

Alton's turned so evylyn you are by far

the most reactive and you can take an

action if you want all you know is that

Strix went up and started to slap Jean

dalla and whack her with her broom of

animated attack and then zon dalla got

off a spell regardless that attempted to

affect artists but you saw him just sort

of shake it off I just I do like the

principle getting between the two kids

on the playground thing I just get

between them I take a few whacks from

the broom on my construct arm I'm like

now now now now calm down calm down I'm

just kind of trying to like I don't know

what the actual action would be but like

I'm not trying to grapple either of them

I'm just trying to separate them I guess

okay well dambulla and artists aren't

that close physically so but if you want

to separate Strix ands and Allah then

yes you can intercede between them and

kind of push them apart a bit yeah I

guess what I'm trying ok here's what

I'll do I'm kind of trying to like

grapples onto LA but like behind me like

I'm getting in front of her so tricks

can't whack her ok but I'm like holding

her behind I'm like taking possession of

yeah make a strength athletics check-ins

and Allah if you don't want to be

grabbed by evylyn you can make a what

would be best for you you can make a oh

ok so you grab all her okay I just had

like kind of I'm holding her but like

protectively right ok chill chill chill

chill chill

also shamash cos still missing her party

I think it's very rude

okay it's a crappy party anyway

yes no you don't want to go to the

parties there is my turn yes would you

like to do anything

damn it so all I saw was and Allah try

to do something to artists are much

needed guide mm-hmm yes can't can I like

yell things at this planner I can talk

absolutely you can talk I didn't say

anything but I I need that ring I cannot

let him leave with that ring right now I

it's been a lifelong need of mine I have

plans for this world and I need the

power to enforce them and you wouldn't

know me I'm not like I'm not an awful

person I'm not like I don't like this I

like that I used the Harper's they they

just don't get done fast enough for

me I I obviously there are people in

this world that need to be taken out of

power artists is one of them he's been

not listening to the Harper's not

communicating with anybody running amuck

with this dumb ring not using it even

half the time we did around plans for

this world I don't have them all planned

out but you know like in the sentence

plants world I just don't know swims I

have plans for this world that include

other people like artists not being in

the world and I need the power to be

able to remove people who aren't

benefiting the public sometimes systems

just don't work anymore and somebody

needs I'm trying to be a vigilante okay

yeah I need that thing

yeah I'm your action and she's she's

going off now that's fine and make a so

you can take your action but before you

do make a perception check

I'm just just so afraid I keep talking

Emily 20 other guides in Charlton and

strips seems to know way more about it

than this guy does 28 as you sort of

take assess the situation and are about

to act one other additional piece of

information for you as you cast your

eyes off the deck of the ship toward the
