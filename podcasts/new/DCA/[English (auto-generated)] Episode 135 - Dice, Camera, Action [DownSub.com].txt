hello everyone and welcome to dice

camera action a D&D show where my face

is way too low on screen I'm gonna move

backwards yep there we go there we go

welcome

so I'm deeming today whether this is

good for everyone or not but anyway this

is my Kris cosplay but I'm gonna take it

off in a second because it's I get too

hot wearing hat so I'm feel like I'm

being attacked um anyway so welcome

aren't we excited so I am here with the

chicken front coven as you have seen in

previous episodes which is very exciting

we have deer in a hall the shadow kai

warlock critter the kobold rogue and per

lock our locks Adhan cleric and so this

episode is called Strix as staff and

we're gonna find out why shortly but

first I want to let the chicken foot

come and do a little bit of explaining

as to what their everyday adventures are

like so we have been as the the waffle

crew has been a mess recently and half

the house has blown up things are

extremely bad so I would just like the

Chickenfoot coven in between getting

knocked out by the black Viper and all

the terrible things that have happened

what have you been up to and what have

you been contributing to the coven

recipe wise you know like just just

pretty much what have you been up to

while the rest of us are just drawing

things and making huge mistakes and

we'll start with we'll start with per

lock since you're in that corner we're

gonna go this way yeah relax tilt like

he's basically like bail in the opening

of Beauty and the Beast like every

morning going through the marketplace

like greeting everybody and like super

happy despite all this like crazy stuff

that's been happening because he thinks

that that's normal the whole point of

like his journey coming here was to

learn like things behind his own world

but yeah his his first contribution to

like the the actual business of

selfishness bread pudding recipe that he

was known for but with after he finally

wore down Warrenton month and became

good friends with emily - not long after

lose him before this started I said that

there's a weekly chicken foot coven

meeting like usually to update on who's

died what horrible things does have have

happened who's possessed what party

members are having an existential crisis

etc and so that was a rough weekly

meeting and they have a board in the

kitchen that says you know it says a

incident since horrific trauma and it's

just zero everyday so yeah the per lock

just keeps erasing it and just probably

crying yeah so his most recent offering

is like a tribute it's a mug cake it's

sort of like a like an English spotted

dick like a pudding

panic cake but it makes them think of

Warrington month it's got smoked apricot

bourbon-soaked current and pepper citrus

glaze just to make that powdery that

sounds lovely

yeah well that's just incredibly

incredibly pleasant strikes we'll just

said a Thierry every time we have that

cake um so what about you critter what

have you been up to

I don't think critter is nearly as

happy-go-lucky and go into the market as

per log her luck is I think it goes at

night and tries to tries to find things

worth baking into pies most of which is

like like rats or rabbits or pigeons and

things like this and a lot of times like

I think is his meat selection probably

gets vetoed well we do have a large

array of customers who might prefer you

know stranger meats so yeah I mean he

probably also spends time catching the

crickets for the special cricket pie oh

yeah most definitely yeah he's a big fan

that I think he hangs out in the kitchen

a lot like moves helped helps everybody

else cook by like nage handing food

around the kitchen as he sits on top of

a cupboard stuff like that but he'll

fell out and he yeah I think he probably

has a really good shrimp pie because he

goes out and gets a whole bunch of

shrimp from the awkward area and stuff

yeah well that sounds good see the

sewers and stuff shrimp pie sounds good

interesting yeah so maybe there's like a

special pie that critter makes that's

just like the critter pie or something

and it's just filled with like maybe

shrimp and crickets and rat meat just

like I just it's like terrible the like

maybe like an occasional goblin customer

or something weird like that will buy I

don't know think yeah that's perfect

all right what about you dear enough so

um I think Tierney Hall gets up like

really early and will feed like leftover

pastries to like the local sea birds

like seagulls and augers and stuff and

then skateboard over to work because I

can have a skateboard if I want to you

could be the inventor of the skateboard

it could just be it I was thinking she

her platinum to get a bunch of like

materials to experiment with and maybe

like make a board that levitates a few

inches off the ground for transportation

a hoverboard perfect yes she has

invented that

yeah she just likes experimenting with

all sorts of magic stuff and she has

like eight different ritual books so

yeah she usually probably gets there

first before anyone else and opens up

and we'll you know socialize a bit with

jinx and not because they're the only

two kids that she likes yeah and I can

imagine that that paltin like Cesar come

in on the hoverboard and just kind of

like looks at it and just like goes back

upstairs with wine great yeah and being

from the shadow fell dear now hald

probably doesn't have a lot of

experience working with fruits so any

sort of free based pastries just confuse

her so most of what she has is well her

flat pie her savory flat pie with a lot

of cheese and tomato and it's

Pizza I mean that sounds really yeah

it's just pizza

all right that's that's great that's you

know and also he infused rosemary Brad

yeah that's that's wonderful and I

figured that she would have very like

customers that would come in

specifically for that because it sounds

so good yeah and she probably also once

she gets to know the customers she uses

a way confined to imitate their voices

and their own heads trying to get them

to tape her more

alrights tricks doesn't know about that

okay she doesn't tell anyone about it

you know probably the richest person in

the even in the waffle crew

oh I'm sure yeah we and one women we

have money we just have to give it all

away anyway

that's perfect so as a normal summer day

in Waterdeep it's actually pretty warm

outside it's about noon you notice that

the waffle crew has vacated the house

you don't know where D if they went he

went on one of his secret e runaways

evylyn is out with the kids they needed

some time out with the out of the house

and she decided to to get out it was

such a wonderful day the other thing is

in the last episode evylyn and strix

went to go try and catch the imps who

had the the stone of galore and the d

they couldn't find them they got away

and they noticed that the castle and

hers

house was far too heavily guarded so

they went back so it's actually been

kind of a dour time at the Waffle House

because we did lose the stone so

everyone's kind of like disappointed in

themselves a bit and this is made strict

sad because when everyone else is sad

Strix gets sad so the Strix has been

kind of rushing around the house doing

odds and ends that you haven't seen her

do before she's been collecting big

things of salts and big things of like

of ash and flour and just kind of

running around and you're not used to

seeing her I guess collecting things so

adamantly but on this particular day on

this warm sunny Waterdeep takes it is

summer I believe still in our timeline

everyone has left the house beside

waffles of course sleeping in her den

besides Strix and you noticed once

everyone is gone you hear her

yell in the common room it's mating time

we have an early meeting this time

everyone needs to come into it I mean

there's no walls in here so just

whatever it's little drafty oh man I

hate early meetings finishes I've been

like cleaning up his workspace so it's

not being left a mess and then we'll

slowly meander on over and prepare for

whatever terrible news is coming our way

yeah usually it's a death and this

doesn't sound like the death scream this

sounds more like maybe there's a

activity scream you've gotten to learn

that at this point since joining made

the hover board she just uses it

everywhere even inside so she just

floats on in on it okay miss tricks just

watches or float in like I don't know

where you I don't know where you got

that but I'm fine I could make you one

it's I don't I I already have a broom it

works the same all right everyone this

is important we have something very

important to do today can I trust you to

do something very very important now

certainly most definitely and you see if

she's closing now using a precedent a

shooter to close all the blinds in the

house and I was that's totally dark and

she looks at you and she says she looks

at you and she says we need some skulls

oh I have two bags of skulls no no

specific skulls

oh okay so we if you ever we lost the

stone of galore we kind of need that for

various reasons and I think that the

main thing we need to do is be more

magicky more powerful and one of the

things I've been wanting to do is put

and she read his mind her and she has

both of her staffs the one that turns

into the broom and the one that is the

staff of the Magi and jizz we need to

put these together and the only way we

can do it is with three skulls Wizards

skulls that I found identified in the

city of the Dead and I need you to go

get them that's how it's here in

Waterdeep you know where it is is it yes

yes dear no yes you're raising your hand

that's very appropriate thank you oh I

don't you just tie them together with

string

no that's not because then they would

just come undone it's important because

then the black staff has one staff I

can't walk around the two staffs tied

together

it's just bad practice there I'm hearing

a lot of rumbling in this okay concerns

questions concerns or questions is this

yes raise your hand excellent are the

skulls inside people's heads right now

that's a good question

no sir okay that won't matter less I

know me you did go to the tip of the

Marg Astor's so the Marg Astor family we

went to their house and that's where we

killed straw but that's neither here nor

there they have a bunch of wizards in

their family and so what I need you to

do is go to their tomb and then she

takes out a piece of paper and she draws

what their tomb looks like there's a

little door and I think there's like two

little things I don't know it looks like

this you need to go do this it's like a

little pyramid and they're all wizards

and so what you need to do is you need

to go into their tomb and don't worry I

hope she like ruffles through her work

robes I have a bunch of information on

how you're going to be able to get in

but it's going to be complicated and

dangerous yes yes dear yes well there be

ghosts she thinks for a second oh I have

done a lot of research and I'm sending

you during the day because we need to do

the ritual tonight when there's a full

moon so I'm thinking that there won't be

ghosts during the day that's my guest

right maybe if the tomb has a similar

logic yeah something like that

no anyway I've researched this and I

know what I'm talking about there's no

ghosts during the day that's what I

think unless you're a bro be impervious

oh it's fine so the first skull I need

you to get is from one of this one's

kind of an exiled Marg aster but I think

it'll be fine

their name is scratch scab Marg aster so

they were turned into a where rat and

later on they were buried next to the

tomb so they have there's a little mound

next to the

where this Reiter rat is buried and it's

like the middle of the day so you might

just have to like I don't know do a

distraction and just dig it up so you

need their skull

rats call then right yeah well scratch

scab was a wizard but they returned to a

we're at so it's probably a where rod

skull yeah

rats call gotcha little boy rats call

different larger much larger I just

crater I know you want to find a rat

skull but just it's bigger I mean I have

six in my pocket yeah I did those were

from the kitchen

those from the pies I don't remember

both anyway so that's one of them and

that's outside the tomb remember that

and it's gonna be busy during the day so

it's gonna be Nobles walking around

people mourning and crying their dead

relatives and things like that so you

figure something out

the next two are inside of the tomb so

the tomb isn't that big so you'll see a

few branching hallways and things like

that down below but also don't tell

anyone about this because I'm pretty

sure DF thinks this is stealing and I'm

pretty sure evil and thinks that this is

desecration of a sacred site and Paulson

doesn't care

you can tell paltin but just so you know

so it's cool I talked already okay when

he's asleep or when he's awake let's go

the last one last skull or sorry the

second skull not the last collidescape

you

the second skull is from lady silva Marg

Astor's she was an illusionist and a

fashionista so to get into her tomb the

door will be locked but what you'll need

to do is prove to her that you are

fashionable but not fashionable enough

to get into the tomb so I have this and

she holds up a bag and it's all of the

old clothes that were Jarl axels that

came out of the bag of holding so it's

just a bunch of leather straps and like

thongs and like fancy hats and she's

just like so you gotta put these on to

convince to convince Silva that you are

fashionable and that's how you'll get in

and then you just you know open the tomb

and take your skull yes dear now I could

also get my good dress from home you can

do that absolutely but these are for

critter and pearl ox so please

enjoy these and she just dumps all of

Jerell axles like like harnesses holding

any questions um how does this work and

could it puts a fog on his head perfect

you're doing a great critter oh good

alright next and the last one and this

one was very dangerous

this is mr. smelly paw Mar gaster so he

was a wizard that was polymorphed into

troop whoa I worked into a cat by a

rival wizard and he couldn't break the

spell but he ended up working or ended

up attempting to be a stay very late I

don't know what happened but the rumors

are that he ended up being the cat of a

very wealthy wealthy old lady and she

left him everything so a lot of them are

gaster his fortune comes from this Marv

gasps sir mr. smelly paw so you have to

go find mr. smelly paws tomb and bring

him a fish as tribute to get into the

tomb and then you'll be able to take his

skull I can get a fish no problem yep

perfect I'm sure there's one in the

kitchen that's old or something or

there's one in your pants maybe I don't

know all right

that is your plan destiny I don't know I

have to stay here and get the ritual

ready before the rest of the team comes

back because if they find out I'm gonna

do this it might explode part of the

house again so we just really need to

get hurrying real fast

is that Alright tricks yes

relax wearing this gigantic like bolero

hat perfect pearl ox is perfect

yes dear net before we go yeah I got you

something uh-huh to mark the some number

of months anniversary of us working here

uh-huh uh-huh jane holl like reaches

into her coat and pulls out this big

clump of hair and hope fix she's like

hey that's some of the black staffs hair

why did you take her hair she gave it to

me I mean that's good we'll just make a

pie out of that later no that's that's

not for pies that's for spells but I

don't want it I don't want to control

the black staff I'm gonna be friends

with her you don't need to come use it

to control her you can use it as a

conduit to enter her dreams I don't want

to do thank you dear dad that's very

thoughtful it just puts it in her robe

your ear I'm glad that we're all friends

and that we all work together even

though sometimes I get a little scared

fighting things about working here

that's that's fair all right I'm gonna

get this ritual ready you all go ahead

to the city of the Dead I believe in you

and should you like salutes scoops up

the whole pile of clothes that starts

leaving the room yeah so you know you've

now been left Strix is shuffling around

you hear her yelling and dropping things

and knowing leg-up don't need that in

the other room so yeah it is now your

turn your time tonight never get your

way to the city of it how you see fit

I've just gonna go to a manhole cover oh

yeah I know a faster way over there and

we can grab a fish along the way okay

I'll meet you there

our critter but yeah I wanna come down

see where's it's way faster day for a

stroll down the street yeah day oh

so critter critter has a preordained

path but he has taken many times through

the sewers I'm sure no real and is going

to find a fish along the way um let's

see just trying to think of a good way

to it like what kind of fish you're

gonna get just roll just roll me a

perception check to see see how well you

do fishing down there in the sewers

it's sorry so it's an incredibly pungent

down there timid 817 oh nice okay yeah

you find a nice a nice possibly a large

goldfish someone has flushed down there

while in on this summery day maybe they

thought they were dead or maybe they are

dead I don't know but you find a nice

large goldfish I think it's still alive

but he picks it up and smacks against

the wall a few times it's not anymore

cool no one likes that all right so you

all make your way down the bustling

streets of Waterdeep there's bards

playing and it's it's again a beautiful

summer day the nobles are out Fanning

themselves and their large dresses and

they don't you know they take a moment

to stare at the elephant large elephant

man with the with the fancy hat walking

down the street once you reach the city

of the Dead you know it's a big massive

cemetery full of marble and and stone

monuments and graves and things like

that but there's a lot of people

enjoying it kind of Park like because

it's so nice today

so now you've reached it there's a there

gosh there's just about someone on every

corner and so you have to go navigate

your way to the Marg Astor's tomb so to

speak on the way there could do an

ecologist sub swung by her place and got

her good dress yes absolutely because

she's faster cuz she's got a skateboard

yeah yes absolutely all right so you all

meet at one of the manhole covers which

you assume critter well just scurry out

of the goldfish I got the fashioned

splendid I'm very proud of you all right

what do you do now is easy you have to

find this mausoleum based on that

Rex gave you a cruel uncurl a crude

drawing so you've managed to find it so

now you're outside of this here at

pyramidal white marble monument with two

little horns sticking out of it I think

first things first is find that Mound

and get that we're at skull I'm relaxed

pissing himself like just putting on a

random manner of clothing series

delegates this involve like feather boa

type thing that's got like some dangling

like paws on the end of it and I like

yeah suspenders that are a floor

pattern perfect just no fashion sense

whatsoever give it a good shot well you

notice a noble couple walks by you arm

in arm and and the the man looks it goes

oh good sir you look excellent it just

continues Wow know a lot about fashion

burlock yeah didn't you hear that

gentleman over there he says enough

excellent you hear his partner go you're

not wearing your glasses

you certainly are being your I've

crafted a very striking appearance for

yourself well thank you that is great to

hear it could use a little adjustment

though I can help you with that though

Oh welcome your input so basically just

like adjust things a bit so it's all

like makes sense and then we'll use a

matter of spells to make the colors not

horribly clashing her lock is finally

dressed but in a gaudy way yeah I

picture one of those like Renaissance

like cravat like a ruffle you like yeah

yeah way over the top yeah like you did

a good job expressing yourself so I

didn't want to change too many things

but I kind of just sort of neaten it up

a little bit yeah you pulls it on yes

it's a quick learning experience SP

mm-hmm only they were made to fit you so

why don't you all give me a perception

check to see if you see the mound of

scratch scab Marg aster do we bring

shovels 3020 you sure didn't I got a

dirty 20 right about you Pro like 13 all

right dear now you notice that on the

right side of this mausoleum is

definitely a large amount of rocks and

what you can see is what seems to be is

small scraps of food may be left is some

kind of tribute to whoever is buried

buried littered around it you did not

bring any shovels and it

an incredibly busy day here in this uh

in this this park slash cemetery so

digging around and this burial mound

might look a little suspicious

okay so critter there's the pot mound

you know I think you would do the best

at digging it up during every sister bag

and pulls a king cou skull out okay use

this the beat on this to dig she takes

out like another skull put some on his

head this will help you blend in and pro

lock and I will run to scratch the

distraction okay perfect I can't see

anything through the skull but perfect

just rivet so you can see through the

eye holes it's like awkward and hard for

him to get over the right spot and it

gets caught on the song it's our wedding

dress head oh you just keep relax got

his antennas hips in like is looking

like this ridiculous mannequin how do

you propose we provide a distraction do

you know any particularly entertaining

MAGIX you could put on a show i I'm not

an entertainer really know but I I

appear to be I was turning heads earlier

it could just be strolling through and

showing off the summer fashion you you

hear suddenly as as critter is trying to

walk over to the bound here oh my god

that dog is wearing a skull on its head

look how cute it is you see a noble in a

big frilly dress start to walk over to

critter come here little boy come here

oh I went to scratch her you're so cute

I would I look up at her and go yeah I

am adorable sweet she could give

me a actually a strength athletics check

does me if she wraps you probably nine

yeah she picks you up

she's very strong she's like a large you

know wide shouldered lady in a massive

flowy flowy like green and brown dress

and she's just like look at this oh I

think he's a pug I love pugs puppy down

now during the hall drips over on her

board and it's just like unhand my

service animal oh I'm so sorry can you

can you persuade her to can i intimidate

her yes there's like this couldn't

possibly be a service animal this is a

purebred

it's a bred service animal and if you

just let it down I will command him to

bite you because I need him to connect

me to the ground or else I will float

away as you can see it loading he's

wearing such this adorable outfit look

at this yes I dressed him like that by

the way I got 21 oh my god yeah she's

just like I am so sorry this is clearly

your your most valued bet and she puts

down critter and she looks you says I'm

I'm sorry oh and she just wanders off

you think she was drunk

I think Dara is very used to dealing

with drunk people at this point it's

true it's true Koerner you're no longer

grappled I go back to yeah it's pretty

easy for you to move some of the rocks

as it starts getting deeper you noticed

that the the dirts a little bit harder

to dig through so you're still you're

still doing your best it's gonna take a

little bit longer though and you notice

a few guards walking down the path

towards you so they're gonna be there in

about two minutes

thing is being very inconspicuous he

looks up sees the guy looks down let's

back up the guards looks down and then

just starts digging away faster the

guards that intercept them yeah yeah

also heading straight towards them so

now there's the two of us all right yeah

you walk towards the two guards they're

just talking

themselves yeah I don't know I think

Todd's an sometimes you know

it's just like ya know Todd the the

guard looks up and she goes no I'm not

really well I mean if you did I would be

very I'd be happy to have any sort of

information about him because he's sort

of been like hitting on my friends and I

don't really have like a judge of

character on him but he seems kind of

like and I don't know how worried I

should be you know those guards suddenly

perks up and it's like oh my god he hits

on everyone what is wrong with him why

is he always hitting on people and

they're clearly ready for gossips or

like tell me everything you know do you

know will engage in gossip but since she

doesn't actually know Todd she's just

going to mix it secondhand things she's

heard from the waffle crew which a lot

of things from palton mostly about him

complaining about Todd and also just

lies okay all right so now we're

spreading all this these horrible lies

about Todd to the city guard

okay whatever what gave me three lies

the most extreme lies you've told about

Todd in this conversation while critter

is still digging furiously behind you

with a skull he never wears underwear oh

my god

disgusting

that's right commando he he never

brushes his teeth you know it's not so

gross

Oh Todd waits the critter pies crickets

yeah heeds crickets all right although

I'll relax put himself between the

guards and the mountain behind them

trying to use his bulk to provide a

medium amount of cover and doing is just

being her charismatic self it's good all

right so now you've told these lies to

the City Guard they seem pretty

satisfied about this and they they

continue on walking or are you gonna

just walk with them to block them from

seeing critter as they walk by the the

tomb

yes and now you're gonna walk on the

other side so they keep looking in my

direction and I'm going to start

informing them about the wonderful

bakery we work at and try to promote the

business as you as soon as you say that

you're like the guard is like oh the one

that blows up all the time well yes but

there is a good reason why it's still in

business despite that the food is

amazing I've never been there because I

keep being told that some of the pies

are crickets in them only the best ones

who said that no I want there is we

attempt to cater to a wide variety of

clientele as Waterdeep truly is the

grand melting pot of faerun and when you

say that the other garden perks up

because of all this nationalism this is

like oh yes it's so true it's the jet

the gem of the sword coast blah blah and

he's like starts going off on about how

how great water deep is and Bob one how

it's got you know the yawning portal is

just so iconic and oh my gosh dear that

just gives the other one a hand pie

perfect alright yeah she will take that

and by then you've passed the tomb and

they say oh they have a wonderful day

baby we'll go to that bakery one day

maybe we'll stop by you know is it is it

currently intact do you know it is

intact enough to not violate any of the

bakers guilds codes oh good we have to

keep on the excellent the PERT the

Baker's guild it's like you know that

the bakery is not any sort of way okay

with the Baker's guild nor has anyone

talked to them so yeah so anyway the

guards continue on critter you're you're

almost there you're starting to find

little bits and pieces of bone so you're

still you're still digging away

you find that the last few pieces are

stuck in there really really hard so you

might need to give me a strength check

or ask for help

straight checks aren't my strong suit

so I'm I think I might I think I'll take

out skewer his short-sword and just

start trying to like like poke around it

to try to like carve carve it out

doesn't actually know how to dig very

well maybe we can cut it like a pie okay

I think that's they look about like I

could still be a strength check right or

like a I guess actually give me a

dexterity to see if you can like

dinosaur bone kind of like oh wow yeah

so you you take your sword in there and

you kind of you start picking around and

you find the the perfect place to wedge

the skull out and you pull out this like

football-sized

where rat skull is from from the inside

of the dirt I found it it turns out you

know if the guards are still there they

continued but you do notice that the the

noblewoman who had picked you up is

still kind of eyeing you from one of the

other tombs towards the left and she's

just like oh he's so cute

this makes me uncomfortable I just take

it over to Porlock and like hold it up

to him just probably like watch in

height I reach down and grab it it's

probably that he's like just pounding it

at this point hmm intriguing very well

done noble woman still around I mean

she's just watching from one of the

other tubes like just just eyeballing

critter thinking that that he's a breed

of dog she's never seen before

candy Renae Holly's awakened mind to

stay say into her head I think I left

the stove on yes I shall do that and try

to like get her to leave

all right yeah she she she's like oh my

my biscuits and she just like takes off

running

baskets yeah

so the noblewoman has been dispatched

you've noticed that there's been a lull

in people it's probably just about I

don't know water doesn't call it noon or

peak but you know what I mean so it's

starting to get later in the afternoon

and you are now faced with this this

tomb and the door you which you haven't

tried to open yet that'll be interesting

that's lower or lock yeah pearl a

completely again just the most direct

person will just reach for the handle or

try to pull it open so the door is

locked

I got it I'll try to try to pick the

lock all right can I get help I don't

know if you can assist with lock picking

unless guidance um nice school so that

gives them a bonus right for I'm doing

oh cool yeah yeah is that Jax plus

proficiency said how lock-picking works

exhibition see yeah so be your decks

bone your dexterity bonus and then you

think you get a few noises repression

din it and then an extra d4 from the

guidance yeah nice yeah you easily pick

the lock to this and it seems like it's

it obviously hasn't been opened in a

very long time so as soon as you hear

hear it click you can almost hear like

an air lock kind of like as the air

comes out of the tomb

smells bad smells right this is a very

nice familiar smell really yes it's been

a lot of time in tombs I think so huh

I hope the more you know he pulls the

tour of

Oh will cast dancing lights like away

from us like good 120 feet away so

people are distracted looking away from

the tomb as we okay go on in there

alright yeah so so you cast dancing

lights somewhere out in the out in the

cemetery and you hear a few people

scream oh my god it's a ghost they told

me they are here in the daytime you're

like running and do you all sneak into

the tomb most definitely yeah all right

you all make it and decide the narrow

dusty smelling corridor in the tomb and

close the door behind you it's now

pitch-black and I believe critter and

deer now you can both see in dirt the

dark but firlock you can yeah I just I

reach up and touch the Hat and cast a

light on it okay all right so your hat

is now glowing people before lighting

light yeah it's just a descending

staircase from what you can see there's

torches on the wall that you could light

if you want to but it goes down probably

a good 40 feet you guys mind if I do a

thing dear no Hall well using our

hoverboard just go down the stairs and

like prestidigitation all the torches on

the long way that's good

yeah so as you go down the stairs are

you searching um actually no I don't I

don't even do that

give me who's who's first I believe deer

nose first okay buy a lot okay yeah all

right so suits deer no men who's next I

think I'll go next

okay and her lock will take up the rear

okay and as he's like as they're going

down the stairs now seeing what she just

did he's going to murmur to the critter

that is that was what I think they

called radical I believe that is indeed

that is do we go

correct I think so I hear these things

in the sewers no journey can you give me

a dexterity saving throw as you reach

the bottom of the stairs yeah 22 all

right as you reach the one upstairs you

hear a trap set off but because you

saved you're only going to take half

damage from this trap so the trap is

fire unfortunately but it's a it's just

a fire arrow so it kind of just comes

under the wall and just singe as you

like and sticks in the wall next to you

but now you know there's traps here

uh-huh traps on a hit sir so you just

goes into a spin and just as like a 360

okay all right well doesn't do that much

damage so you're okay it only does seven

points of damage

there's no fire arrow sticking in the

wall

Oh as we go back her to pull it out of

the wall free fire arrow it just

disappears and your hands kind of singed

oh well there are traps so people with

the best perception and keep their guys

out for traps and then critter can

disarm them you feel like these these

might be um I mean since this this tomb

is so old they definitely haven't been

set off anytime recently so I definitely

need to stay alert so as you reach the

bottom and all the torches are lit now

you're faced with two separate paths one

goes left and one goes right you're in a

hole activates four eldritch sight and

looks for magic okay

there is magic going down both pathways

both at the end which one looks more

dangerous I mean they're both magic II

so whichever you feel is more dangerous

can you give me like a rough school of

magic feel yeah

left is illusion and the right is just

general general magic like just you can

tell that there's just something that's

like probably trapped down on the right

but on the left is illusionary magic

okay so that way is traps that way is

illusions which one do you want guys I

like illusions okay what about you /

luck

you got any preference okay let's go and

to fit in

I will cast an illusion myself and

she'll use a minor illusion to like make

it look like they're like bats flying

around us nice it was like jumping up

trying to grab them so what's your what

is your perception right now as you're

going down this path yeah just give me

just so I know what you're all staying

stay alert 22 okay cool

that's party ever all right as you reach

the end of this hallway you notice that

there's another trap near the end you

can see a thin line and the in the in

the stone near the bottom so you think

it could be another arrow trap pretty

little will scamper up to it and

investigate it and see if you can disarm

such a thing I have no idea how to do

some traps it's just a thing of sleight

of hand

22 sweet yeah that's pert that's just

enough you managed to move the little

tripwire to the side and keep it from

activating the spell and yeah now you're

along we're going to continue on your

way as you reach the end of the hallway

you're faced with a what looks like just

a large stone door and on the outside

written in a scrollwork it says lady

Silva Mar gaster mm-hmm I believe this

is who we were supposed to prove to be

fashionable too

oh well during the hall throws off her

cloak and reveals her good dress critter

throws I feel some song over his head

yeah Jana has like this long white

flowing ballgown and like a jacket over

her shoulders with like a gold chain

keeping it from falling off oh yeah

Daniel looks good his glowing bolero hat

at a slight angle of this boy perfect

alright um yeah so you're just faced

with the store so whatever you want to

do next up to you

Darren uh knocks on the door politely

yeah you received no response you know I

think everyone in this building is dead

that doesn't mean that they can't answer

in door huh no it's all about that way

well she'll chill look over the door

with her eldritch sight to see if

there's any like magic traps on it first

on this story you don't you don't get

any sense that there's any magic traps

here then she will try to open the door

all right yeah you open the door it

creaks open into another larger open

room and in the center there's a mirror

and nothing else it's just a big domed

kind of underground tomb with a mirror

right in the center are you one of those

curse mirrors the mirror does not

respond not gonna tell me your secrets I

she's gonna like shift up against the

wall and sneak around the mirror so it

she she's not catching her own

reflection in it and try to get closer

so she can inspect it better all right

yeah dearness now treating the mirror as

if it were a sworn enemy what are the

rest of you doing on how this is ruled

DM her life doesn't know how to cast

identify although last time mr. Perkins

ruled that it consumed the pearl worth a

hundred gold pieces would

like every pledge that in the means yeah

of course yeah you have your okay so you

can cast identifying this mirror and

other than it having some sort of

enchantment on it you can tell it's just

a regular mirror it doesn't have any

magical properties other than and what

you can what you think is just some kind

of enchantment and chant meant specific

to this to this task which is being

presented with a fashionable outfit o us

elves are notoriously resistant to

enchantment so I vote that I will face

this mirror fo alright so you walk in

front of the mirror yes believe in you

and I'll cast guidance on her as I step

away to let her do that okay I'll get a

council Hall and watch the other

direction just she's also probably gonna

use like druid craft to give her like

just the right amount of like billowing

in the wind and some prestidigitation so

she's kind of like extra clean and

thaumaturgy show you to making various

bits glow oh man can you like please

just like catwalk up to the mirror - yes

like sashay all right so so dearness

sachets up to the mirror illusion some

music for her so yeah looks looks

fashionable AF and you can see the the

surface of the mirror shimmer a bit and

you notice that as you're showing off

this wonderful fashionable outfit you

can see that it shows in the back almost

on on near the wall where you don't see

one you actually see an inlet where it

looks like the body of the of the of

silt Silva is rested but you don't see

it here you see it in the mirror the

mirror also in glowing letters you can

see it appear at the top says fresh AF a

wink flirtatiously at the mirror the

mirror Simmons

[Laughter]

so either the body is in that inlet over

there

she says pointing or it's inside there

yeah we will win it's now the mirrors

shimmer isn't now it's gone and you look

as the two of you per lock and creditor

look you can't see anything on the side

of the wall but you haven't even

examined anything yet so you're not sure

crater haphazardly shove your hand in

that space expecting that there's an

illusion there and that you'll reach

through it

courier charges that space full force

like a prince

okay um critter you just like what say

what is this like a check or like it's

like a mess I don't know I don't know

what it is but it's stupid I guess

give me I don't know I guess yeah and

athletics check you mean uh what

um

if they don't we can do about it help us

Dungeons and Dragons person

[Music]

[Laughter]

[Music]

oh the board just reset okay we should

be back now we're back okay you should

be able to hear us now it was a ghost

even though they don't come out during

the daytime Oh

all right we're back technical

difficulties aside critter was jumping

through Oh or into a wall so critter

rolled in 11 for his dexterity saving or

not dexterity athletics checkers and

that's just enough to as you jump

towards this extremely solid object you

pass through it and then crash

unceremoniously into a very decomposing

skeleton holding a bunch of bones in a

small Inlet in the wall oh I'm very

proud of you critter thank you

you're a very good employee I know is he

invisible to us now he is yeah he just

looks like he just went through the

stone wall I fish around and try to find

the skull of this pile of bones don't

forget to also check the pockets yeah

this got this this body is actually

covered in quite a bit of jewelry and

things like that so it's it's and Strix

didn't necessarily specifically inform

you not to steal things she probably

should have in retrospect now that

you're there there's skulls

yeah if you can get me like a ring or

enoughness I would appreciate that stuff

in his pockets okay it's got a lot of

pockets all right so you stuff you stuff

a few shiny baubles from this corpse

into your pockets and you find the skull

vaguely attached to a spine so as you

pick up the skull it's kind of attached

to a spine that depends on if you're

attached to thank ya okay

alright so you take the rich you have it

you do you do what you will now I go buy

the beer like tilting the Hat a little

bit more and stepping back and posing

yeah the mirror is still saying

things like fresh AF and work it and

other things yeah it's very encouraging

can we take those Mira with us I like

this mirror that's up to you

critter comes back to the wall holding a

skull with a spine still attached and

like these pockets oh oh you got a free

spine lucky yeah did you find any like

cool jewelry that might work with my

outfit oh definitely I throw a couple

necklaces towards her I put them all on

bling I like it it is okay for a lock in

the mirror let's go with you but I don't

think you would have a problem holding

it for Allah take it if you would like

this I I suppose nobody will be missing

it it would be a wonderful gift for the

Paladin one oh yeah this seems quite up

her alley it does it'll go great with

the emoji shield

trying to lift it from the wall alright

yeah it comes off you can't you can take

it with you it is awkward to walk with a

big mirror but you're you're tall and

large enough to where it shouldn't be a

problem yeah just have it under an arm

now yeah beside that was probably lonely

down here anyway

it's fair it will do some good in the

future now alright well I suppose this

just the cap is loved yep

who here's good with animals I would

like to roll insight I think that's a

contestant in sight which mean the

critter if you're deceiving deer now or

not 15 I got in that one

you believe you believe him

he's great with animals you probably got

a good rapport with them having lived in

sewers right oh yeah I got pen shrimp he

loves me miserable I have a familiar but

he's mad at me right now oh he does not

like that I am NOT following the Raven

Queen anymore well you see the trick is

when your pet starts acting up you just

eat them and then go get a new one

general summons this albino Raven

familiar an asset I'm told I'm supposed

to eat you if you disagree with me I

don't I don't think you're familiar

likes that so you agree with me or else

I have to eat you I'm sorry it's the

rules I mean they're your familiars so I

mean they have to agree with you that

one looks delicious

may I know his name Sam awake

oh she puts him on his head her on her

head she puts him on her head perfect

all right so you should never get sick

of it that looks like a baker good kebab

advice Kurt has been serving some

interesting things to the waffles ooh

but yeah so all the torches are lit in

the hallway you can make your way back

or do whatever you wish so let's go yes

I suppose off to find mr. smelly paw his

dear nough leading us again on the

hooker board down the hallway

well at least back to where the fork was

I think she just goes like this and

pushes herself off so she's just gliding

in this pose perfect so dear no glides

to the fork in the road and again you're

faced with the other one which I can

only assume is you're next you're next

Korie I detected magical traps down here

so you're out all right look around for

the traps all right

give me a perception check for those

traps and I will also give him guidance

just because I can even though it won't

stack that's nice though reception yeah

yeah I roll the three got a one on the D

for loss on the perception

all right well courtesies no traps you

hover so you actually missed the trip

line so you go first and critter you

trip over both as you're trying to

search for traps and to acid arrows come

out wall at you unfortunate so give me

an another dexterity saving throw

thirteen I think that way is it Jackson

hold on let me see yeah okay I think

that's yeah that's enough so you're fine

you'll take half damage so hold on okay

so that's eight damage okay and I'll use

my reaction to cast absorbed elements

and only take four damage well that's

fun no that's a spell I've never seen

used before and the next attack you will

deal an extra 1 d6 acid damage yeah so I

I attack the place with a Sarah came

from that's a cool ability is I don't is

that a rogue ability or is it no it's a

it's a spell it's a level one like

wizard spell of course it's a wizard

spell Wizards arcane tricksters and

eldritch Knights get it oh it's an

arcane trickster that's super cool I've

never played an arcane trickster anyway

we're all learning new fun things

um that's really cool

alright so acid arrows shoot they miss

critter and critter casts a cool spell

it's very impressive

honey it's the where the trap came from

poke it with a little bit of acid on the

wall yeah ha take that wall the walls

I think I disarmed all the traps here

guys it's okay there's like a hole being

eaten through like toys and the another

patch in that jacket

all right you continue down the path

dearness still hovering and you reached

a similar door to the other tomb that

you entered but this one says mr. smelly

pom are gaster written in scrollwork on

the front Darin an ox again just in case

yeah you getting a view no response well

that means we got a break in Lock

reaches forward and just tries to open

the door uh yeah the door opens easily

and as you swings open you notice that

this tomb is much different from the

last one the last one was so empty and

stark well you notice when you open this

door is complete gold gilding all over

the entire entrance of this tomb all

over the walls are just covered in gold

and jewels just sparkling and shining

and in the center is a statue of a cat

sitting on a golden pillow and holding

one paw up statue okay mm-hmm it's a

golden statue of a cat with ruby eyes

maybe the the corpse was bronzed it's

possible or gol did well this is a very

fancy tomb prick for mr. smelly Palmer

gasps sir

you're not saying cattitude huh sorry

are we supposed to eat the skull yeah

okay because of her Eldridge and

invocation do you always have speak with

animals going so she's just gonna say in

cat hello cat we are here to bring you

to someplace nicer so do not become an

apparition

attack us please you get no response but

your party members here are you going

yom-yom

yeah no yeah a place in here where there

might be an actual body of a cat like

you know you know a canopic jar or small

yeah so the the gold cat is on top of

what looks like it could be a tomb

something that could encase the actual

body of the cat I might be careful about

moving that statue I've heard stories of

strange things happening when you move

gold statues but I believe we're

supposed to be getting untrue to

underneath it but uhm you know what else

to say about gold statues they're made

of gold by the way you're still holding

on a mirror and gold

it's what money is made out of oh is how

our money is yes oh it makes a bit more

sense oh yes yeah and then you can use

this gold to purchase goods and/or

services I'm gonna scamper over to the

gold statue look around the base of it

and see if it has any story indication

of a pressure plate or anything like

that on it okay I just give me a

perception check or an investigation

whichever you feel like you're you're

investigating investigation would be

better that's attend um you don't notice

any pressure plates but you do notice

that in front of the cat there is a what

looks like a delicate gold plate like

like a like a dinner plate yes hmm I

would suggest that you leave an offering

of fish upon this plate finish that's

right I totally forgot he takes out the

gold fish and walks it on the plate

thanks burlock I was just gonna end up

eating that for a snack if you never

mind me

but as the fish touches this delicate

gold plate worthy of any fancy feast

commercial the cat's paw lowers and you

notice that the statue itself raises up

and inside of this golden sort of like

almost yeah like a canopic jar kind of

thing you see the third dried remains of

a cat skeleton well there's just coal no

reach and grab it you just reach in and

grab it no yeah maybe you want to take a

few other bones just in case she ends up

needing more I mean maybe the spinous

will be a - the skull out you hear what

almost sounds like a cat hissing and

your net halt understand what that means

yeah you can actually and you hear it

say you didn't wait for me to finish

eating it won't notice wants to eat and

you notice that in the corner of the

room now there is a massive spectral

ghost cat and I need you to roll

initiative

I knew ghost came out during that you

now know that Strix has no idea when

ghosts come out do your no hollows from

the shadow fell so she was expecting

this yeah

all right give me your chambers 13th

critter 15 for burlock 15 gripper lock

and 24 for deer 'no hall there's are all

way better than we do man

just like i have my lucky dice well

clearly all right well the first to go

is deer next year old a 24 so this ghost

cat looks like a larger version of a

house cat and you can see the he's

actually wearing a little collar that

says mister

smelling paw but he's pissed he's like

you're not Hall hisses back at him

without a twig and casts which bolt okay

so she goes and red lightning shoots her

hands all right and that is 23 to hit

that isn't definitely enough yeah yeah

so now I do forty twelve lightning

damage okay that's a shitload of damage

yeah well I have to cast all my spells

at the next level because I'm a warlock

that's right

[Music]

thirty-four damage all right oh yeah so

the cat might see if they're immune to

anything nope they're not immune to

which bolts or no no is it thunder

damage it's lightning damage Oh actually

they're immune they are resistant to

lightning damage so they take half of

that still it's a good spell and it

looks cool so you did 35 you said 34 34

okay so half of that all right

17 cool all right

okay so the ghosts take some damage and

its spectral form and the the lightning

kind of like bounces off the weird gold

gilding in this tomb and makes it

I always come pretty you know as far as

tomb robbing goes like this is a neat

experience

you definitely are not getting paid

enough though next up is the ghost so

the ghost is going to try and possess

critter so I need you to give you a

charisma saving throw that is not enough

so you dive into critter and you now are

completely incapacitated

but you also just want to do cat things

so you're now possessed by a cat awesome

yeah so critter just starts doing cat

things you're play yourself as a cat you

are now a cat unless they can D possess

you by a ghost and now you're just cat

so you're actually you're out of

initiative but critter is now cat hmm

well I'd like to try something critter

here critter and I'm gonna raise my the

symbol rub my neck and and try to cast

turn up dead and see if it like pushes

the thing out of him oh yeah I think

that yeah okay yeah so roll I guess the

ghost would roll it the wisdom save

let's see yeah do some like Doctor

Strange soul push out of the body kind

of deal yeah okay

so yeah that's only a 10 so the so yeah

you deep possess critter suddenly curta

you're no longer a cat I crater was

holding the skull with the spine still

attached and like batting at the fun and

then 50 possessed and then just keeps

batting the spine was actually your turn

as well per lock so that was good that's

perfect so is your turn the initiative

so next up that critter it's your turn

you were no longer a cat his D possessed

you well that was weird

is the cat goes still there know that

like you just want the cat goes has now

pulled itself back out and it's kind of

just sitting above its body just hissing

oh that little tackles up does it happen

to be a CR 1/2 or lower creatures it is

not no okay it is a business I would've

destroyed it if it were oh no no it's

stronger than that but yes it what

you're correct its it's a spookier

stronger ghost

I guess is it right up next to me you're

all within about 5 feet of it so you're

really close to it

okay I'll just stab it see if it works

all right so you aren't stabbed yes and

I have advanced because I packed tactics

as a kobold and I'm gonna cast green

flame blade that is a 1 T not natural to

hit yes

oh yeah that's plenty yeah 6 plus 4 is

10 damage four of which is fire that

matters it does yes okay and the rest is

piercing non-magical yes okay so that's

so how much fire damage for okay so it's

gonna take two of that and then how much

piercing six okay so it's also mean to

that so it's gonna take three all right

so you did you did some damage but it's

it's a ghost so oh joy it's sneak attack

against a ghost or son dead immune to

see attacking five eh I remember I don't

know think you shouldn't be as long as

there's somebody else an enemy and yeah

as long as you have an ally within um

sorry I'm Darrell sees back to me well

14 sneak attack damage it's no longer

turned now all right okay cool which is

still only at 14 so I'm links okay all

right so you did you did a bunch damage

is still immune to a lot of it because

um it's a ghostie but it does look

worse for the wear it's kind of fading

in and out of our earthly existence

spooky okay

oh they're immune to piercing damage I

think does that mean that they just

don't take the damage yeah you know

damages no well okay so then it only

took the fire damage okay well for

damage okay yeah but you did I mean stab

it so all right thank you everyone I'm

bad at math okay um back up to dear now

it's your turn so is it resistant or

immune to lightning it is resistant to

lightning okay well then I will maintain

my concentration by which bolt to do

another 46 to it or at 4012 to it

automatically cool because which bolt is

a good spell in it yeah 41 haft is you

know 2021

all right 21 you said

total total okay after the resistance

okay yeah this thing's it's looking real

bad

I'm just looking but it is its turn so

let's I want to see I'm still hissing at

it you're just so I'm trying to assert

my dominance um all right each of you I

need to do a wisdom saving throw the

cat's gonna like hiss and a horrible

frightening way I'm gonna try and scare

you this is yeah it's a fear of fact

yeah okay I have advantage on those is

he locks it on oh I got a five I bet

that succeeds - I got a 16 um okay so

per lock and dear and I you managed to

evade this critter Oh critter so you're

frightened but you also aged ten years

those are beads for how long do Coles

live

no but you've now aged ten years maybe

you're now just like you're like a

hunched older Cobalt

it's not 25 715 so okay so you're now an

older old and you feel creepier it's

very confusing and you are frightened so

on your turn you may do us saving a save

girl and the aging can be reversed with

a greater restoration spell but only

within 24 hours of it occurring so you

know that you're just gonna come back

older may be wiser who knows um let's

see

but yeah so that's the ghost turn next

up is per lock oh we should probably

leave and he's gonna cast spiritual

weapon as a bonus action in the form of

a just a giant like cat toy like sort of

whip and weapon yes let's

as my spell casting attack bonus that's

a 24 to hit yeah that is definitely

enough that is only four was a force

damage yeah force damage um are they

immune to force let me see this ghosty

this booty go no they're not they take

they take all four damage oh my god they

are really hurt spiritual button is a

bonus action so you can still cast a can

trip yes but no damaging can trips so he

will instead just walk up and pull out a

rolling pin and just smack it nice which

is 15 to hit yeah it hits

is free budgeting damage alright how do

you kill the ghost just like a bad kitty

like trying to like whack it with like a

magazine kind of deal yeah you you whack

this ghost and it's just like Rand just

disappears and it's it's it's you can

see it's ghost the essence go back into

into its tomb and the lid kind of just

slides back on real fast

critters still just screaming running

down the hall oh your fear goes away as

soon as the ghost is back it is - when

you're just down the hallway oh now it

doesn't seem so bad but my joints ache

slightly more than I used to yeah you

know what the skulls critter yes okay

good all right you vanquished all of

your foes let's go see what in this tomb

it was already dead as it that again

it's been defeated I'll take it and I

will take all its stuff she like takes

out a knife and like start frying like

gems out and the stuff but likes doing

the thing where he has got his back

turned on purpose where he's like if I

don't see them do that it's that's fair

I need to reintroduce this capital into

the market but the the spiritual cat toy

is still up and just like occasionally

women so how many gems do I get um oh

gosh let's see what stuff do I get Holly

how much gold do I have okay um gems

yeah nice you're eight gems of varying

varying degrees of riches this goes on

long enough

relax gonna set them here back down

propped up against a wall and start like

fiddling with his look again imposing

while everybody else is busy doing stuff

yeah it's taking a while they're just

looting the tomb things that Strix did

not tell them to do

just giving up on your life legs like

looking in the mirror like where's my

scales always that dark of green so the

yeah the mirror is still giving you

wonderful compliments it's still telling

you look great all those things

Joran I you after looting the entire

tomb you get five more gems and I'm sure

you've managed to take a couple of

pieces of gold from the wall to just

pocket those also colds can live to be

125

according to chat so critter you just

feel you feel like you're up drinking

age now yeah I think kobolds also like

get adulthood a lot faster than humans

so they're like a weird like heavy on

both heads oh spectrum that is

interesting

he's have a really long middle-aged

period yeah he's starting to think about

refinancing his mortgage yeah he's

saying maybe who's gonna buy a

motorcycle

yeah he's think about buying a

motorcycle things that Darren dearness

hoverboards really cool yeah wasn't cool

before I get down here but now it is

alright your are you finished looting I

think now I am now that I've taken

everything alright so you have a fairly

sized now like bag of loot with you and

a mirror

mmm and a bunch of skulls this may

arouse suspicion Shrek's is gonna be so

happy yeah we got the skulls and all

this extra crap

I can I can hold on to the extra step

for you Jason about him of the jewelry

but he'll keep a couple of a couple of

smaller shiny things to himself

relax gonna start heading back towards

the the entrance

and try to have a peek out to see if

there's anybody nearby all right

heard a lot cuz you lead your crew down

up or up the stairs to the top of the

tomb are you gonna just crack open the

door

yeah and I'm going to before I do that

cast silence in the vicinity to try to

make sure that there's as little

suspicions aroused as possible all right

okay you do that and as you crack open

the door right in front of the door are

the two guards talking amongst each

other and as soon as you cast silence

they get convicts they're like very

confused and now they're kind of talking

to each other looking around and give me

a stealth check so they try and see if

you can close the door fast enough 18

yeah you do it

you close the door fast so the guards

don't see you then it will drop silence

and you hear them you can hear them

talking outside of the door and hear

them say your flag to the door the door

and yeah you hear them saying yeah this

you know this this lady said that there

was a there was a dog digging outside up

here and they pulled some skull out and

then then she saw them going to the tomb

but I don't know I don't see anyone

around here so you know maybe we should

go get Todd can I if I hear this I know

where they are cast calm emotions on the

other side of the door to try to make

them feel at different uh yeah I think

you can do that

it's a DC 13 charisma save okay yeah go

ahead and do that all right

one guard is suddenly very calm the

other guard doesn't react so one guards

like wow I just um really you know I

feel really good all of a sudden I think

I'm gonna just go home and take a nap

I'm like what are you talking about like

there's the grave robbers in here I know

but I'm really tired so you this

conversation going on

so one guard you notice walks away but

the other guard is still guarding

outside of the tomb kind of checking the

locks noticing that the lock has been

picked and things like that you don't

want me to distract them yes do you know

I think this may be your wheelhouse um

[Music]

Dena wraps her cloak back around here it

takes out her shadrach eye mask and puts

it on it's like really spooky looking

and she like uses various spells just

make her more billowy and ghost-like ooh

then she looks through the crack in the

door and then uses blessing of the Raven

Queen to teleport out and hey

so for around she's all like translucent

and the femoral and she hlep appears out

and turns around to look at the god and

goes I don't like you standing around my

grave can you throw me an intimidation

check yes

well is he confident Aaron's like oh

we're dressing up again and preserve

falling back on and said it's not 26 oh

my god yes

the guard looks and goes hi they come

out during the daytime and they just

take off running I don't think the water

deeps finest is uh is put on graveyard

duty all body expects the daytime goes

yeah you also notice that a few of the a

few of the nobles and things around you

have also taken off running so now might

be your time to try and escape the tomb

okay I'll clear the way we go there's

through the door alright are you just

gonna run through the streets of

Waterdeep with this bag of loot and

mirror oh no I'm gonna run through the

sewers of Waterdeep and encourage my

probably too large L'Occitane friend

since you had to go into the battle I

think he will still decline

but we'll like take off the the bundle

of clothing and stuff and like put it on

top of the mirror and start carrying it

looking like he's like performing a

moving service type deal

like here's just some things from a

production down the street of the local

theater kick okay give me a deception

check to see if people are gonna believe

you as you walk down the street with

this mirror and deer and I'm guessing

you're with him holding the loot yes

but I'm doing a rad skateboard trick

okay we are part of some sort of

production thing so now 15 all right

that's that's enough to convince the

lists the people in the street that you

are indeed doing a production of

whatever show you you wish and critter

you're you're fine masseur he's nothing

comes up as you usually do you muttering

themself I understand wide nobody likes

going through the sewers doesn't make

any sense

far superior mode of transportation yeah

it's fair and you smell terrible and you

make it back to troll scholarly in front

of the Waffle House with with no

incidents it seemed almost too easy take

the win are you going to go inside and

show Strix the mirror or you're gonna

keep that a secret

oh absolutely like present it and like

oh look at this wonderful thing that

maybe would enjoy you know we got this

for a Boleyn

we had some extra time all right so you

go in strikes creed soup as you walk

into the into the taproom Strix has

closed all of the blinds and in the

center there's a burning brazier of

green fire and around it is a massive

looks like what the designs on her staff

in salt and flour on the ground done up

and she's like don't step on it and then

on each there's three different chairs

and on each chair there's a different

symbol

and she looks at all of you and she says

I need where's the sculls what is that

mirror what is that critter has the

sculls we got this mirror for evil and

that's all you need to know yeah that's

all I got another skull that has a bonus

spine attached I thank you extra to the

spine yes and then I got the other one

that's her at school

perfect she just in sight checked you

dear and she did not roll well enough so

she's just like all right I believe you

so she doesn't notice any of the

you stole I feel like this is a very

common relationship for them dynamic

yeah she's like I believe you it's fine

all right so each of you needs to put

one of those skulls in the chairs so who

wants whose skull just put in the chairs

I vote cat house or the cat well I'll

hold on to the one with the spine here

you get the rats ball and hand it to

burlock all right I'm going to need you

to hold onto all of these while I do the

ritual are you fine with that I am I

burn I don't know if it's gonna burn it

on question mm yes is this gonna end us

up with us being possessed No

so maybe probably not I've already been

possessed once today it's really not

that bad no you're gonna have to tell me

about my lady no did you take anything

else from the tomb yes of course this is

mirror well the mirrors weird start just

gonna go stand in front of it and the

mirror just says you she's like this

mirror is rude fade away well we'll get

rid of the later doesn't matter um all

right so you all sit down in the chairs

with the skulls and strix runs off and

she comes back and she has her two

different stabs and she's like you know

what I was thinking about where you said

Derrida and that was a good idea and she

takes this and she starts wrapping them

and sticking them together with rope

hey I gotta make sure they're physically

in contact so the magic takes easier and

it's Mary I just done that the whole

time instead of the whole skull thing

the skull you'll see what the skulls are

for in a second stop complaining on the

go get yourself a snack it's gonna take

me a second and she's still like

wrapping the things together and she's

uh

she runs back up to her panic room a few

different times and comes back and she's

got different bits and pieces like a an

actual chicken foot what looks like a

pile of dirt like some weird tongues and

she starts setting them in different

places on this wheel on the ground it

looks like it doesn't make any sense but

maybe it does to her I don't know

yeah she's holding both stabs and she

sticks both stabs into the burning

brazier it doesn't bother her because

she it's fire resistant so she just

sticks them down and what must there

must be sand in there that's burning

just sticks them in there and she's like

alright we're almost ready but we need

some pies so we need you to go get your

favorite pies from the kitchen and bring

the back you know I have these human

pies yeah you get that one dear no not

the human pies we need meeting or your

bread your breads very good bring the

bread okay I'll bring the bread bring

any baked goods yes relax can go grab

the mud cake alright girl exactly but

that will do yeah gonna cast protection

from energy and himself and make them

resistant to fire because he's a little

bit nervous that's wise that's very wise

like I could summon a demon but I don't

think that would help don't do that you

don't need that problem we don't need

that right now

so you do all go get your pastries yep

alright everyone goes and gets their

pastries and comes back and you have

your skulls she's like doing a checklist

everything's laid out alright familiar

sit in the corner yes that's fine that's

fine you can get okay

familiar just flies away all right

should I take waffles out now waffles is

fine it's not gonna be that big of an

explosion I don't think can you cast

that spell on everyone here maybe the

protection from energy or is that just

on you oh this is it's just something

that I use when I work in the kitchen I

don't think I'm able to do it anymore

the one person that it's alright just

checking

all right so she stands up so there's

four chairs there's the three that

you're sitting on she stands up on the

last chair and she just like brings our

hands together and she's like all right

I'm going to try and cast something on

this and if it works then they should be

fused together but it might explode oh

wait hold on she like gets off the chair

and she walks up to the door and cast

arcane lock on the front door and she's

like just in case anyone wants to come

home or once any pies this is fine all

right the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory

all right I need you all to stand on

your chair and hold your pie and your

skull why wait by the window and turns

the sign around so it says closed okay

good thinking this is why I think you

get paid I don't know do you get paid I

don't know I get tipped a lot that's

good good good good

I'll prepare the blown up sign just

relax chair support his weight yes yeah

you're standing on stron Vaughn chair

ovitch yeah all right so strict then

holds up her own pie and you're each

holding a skull and pie and she says and

at the count of three I'm gonna need you

to smash the pie in the skull together

hmm

are you ready I suppose all right I hope

this works and she starts counting

because one two wait is it is it on

three or after three

it's on three okay on three so one two

three

yes okay also do you think this was

grave-robbing I don't know if it was

grave robbing or not maybe we'll talk

about this later at our weekly meeting

no I definitely involved a grave and

robbing well all right ready it all his

corpse repositioning that's fine all

right one two all right great and you

smash the skulls and the pies together

and you notice that they start to

dissolve into what looks like burning

or a green flame that merges into the

center brazier and Strix is like well I

guess we'll try the final thing and just

cast fireball on it so a massive

fireball erupts in the tap room you're

all protected by the careful spell

unfortunately the windows in the tap

room are not so in a massive explosion

of green fire the front window is blown

out of the tap room again the fire

swirls all around you your familiar is

protected as well Jenna don't worry and

as it coalesce into the center you

notice that the fire swirls around the

staff and both staffs fuse into one so

it must have worked

you think the rope disappears and sluff

Soph almost like a snake shedding its

skin and you can see it just sticking up

in the center brazier and it looks

pretty much the same it has the same

crescent shape and the symbols and

everything but the the staff itself is

the staff of the staff of the Magi so

it's more sleek and neater looking and

has like a cool like taper up to the top

for staff not just a stick that Strix

found in the in sigil but strikes is

still holding the pie it's on fire now

and she looks at the staff she's like I

think it worked

look at it it's it's one now unless the

other one just exploded I don't know

hold on and she goes up and picks it up

and she's examining she's like it worked

like it works see you did it good job

the taproom is on fire up we should fix

this I'm gonna start create or destroy

water and just like have it rain and the

parts that are on fire the most yes well

I should have implemented that the last

time the house was on fire we have a lot

of abilities in our group that have not

been utilized by you which would have

been very useful at a lot of times but

pretty much all of her life spells were

like Kitchen related but you're so good

at baking that's what matters not to

mention her grave rapping skills that's

true

alright let's try and clean this up

before everyone gets back maybe may I

add something to your staff

I mean sure as long as it's like not

more fire Janna takes out like a

necklace that might like like have like

an arcane symbol because they were

robbing wizards and just like on the

head of the staff like there oh that

looks nice it's dangly yeah

it's always nice to have like one dangly

item in your ensemble yeah well relax

putting out fires he like immediately at

one point looked startled and dashes out

of the room to make sure that the Hat

that he found is still intact yeah it's

definitely still intact you hear a knock

on the door it's it's not frantic it

sounds like a questioning customer I'll

get it

do you open do you turn the sign back

from open from closed to open yes and

then I peek out the window as they do

all right yeah you see that's just you

see just a couple looking for they're

looking for a nice meal they just look

like a little halfling couple expecting

the wonderful pie shop that's been

exploded like 20 times I slowly open the

door and say hello are you here to be

evil if no you may under there like well

that's an interesting request but yes

we're just here for pies okay well I

think it most places should have a

policy of no evil occurring on the

premises it's just good business

practice that's fair but yeah you

assured them in Strix is gonna go get

them some pies and settle them in while

you put more of the fire out a few more

customers come in and mill about the the

house has one massive hole in the

ceiling the windows are now blown out

everything is charred the brazier is

still in the center Strix comes in with

a piece of wood and just puts it on top

of the brazier and it's now a table

so and she sets another customer on it

um but she comes out she comes out and

she kind of looks a little like she's

still holding her staff and she just

looks a little thoughtful and she says

you know what I haven't praised you

enough for helping me you've really made

this something special and I think that

the people here like coming here and

they like what you make and they like

what I make and I think that's worth

something I think that you're good and I

think this place is good is it worth

payment you're gonna have to talk to

Dias about that but I'm gonna pay you in

something nicer and she reaches into her

robes and she pulls out a few different

things one for each of you and she she

looks at you dear dad says this is for

you I think you'd like it the most it's

a jar of ghoul tongues and I want to

give it to you then she hands it to you

do you know snatches it careful though I

think they wiggle around a little bit

better this is the best day ever thank

you so much and so she hands you that

you know give Strix a hug oh she

responds in her awkward her awkward way

and she's going to gifts and we're in a

cup and we are now can legally sisters

yay sweets is like I have a new grandma

but I like a new sister my brother is

awful

then I shall say Horton she just like

takes out a knife like where is your

brother oh you know I think he's in the

shadow fell fine I'm not going back

there no don't go back there um she's

gonna she's going to go up to a critter

and hand critter a oh my gosh oh this is

perfect critter you're going to get a a

pipe that that uh oh no no she was gonna

get that pearl like I'm sorry critter

you're gonna get a book of morovian

nursery rhymes so she's going to hand it

to you and say critter I feel like you

might have a better

life if you become literate a man might

help I actually can read but I just

doubt much what I like this book are

there pictures there are plenty of

pictures at it oh look at that picture

and she and she hands she hands him the

book and and says why do you look older

that's that's really weird

I got scared by a cat it was a de ghost

I but ghosts don't come out during the

day I thought we have that conversation

they do you just weren't everybody in

that strange part thinks that they do

come out during the day that's for sure

they do come out during the day you just

weren't listening to me I know all about

ghosts that's that's fair

oh one more thing and she like it

reaches into her bag and she gives

critter her varnish basilisks i if you

don't want to read you can just like

chew on this oh I tried you know what

can you do kobolds right anyway Sherlock

for you I have a very special thing that

I once gave to who's the guy that had

the weight ring of winter last I don't

know we killed him and I took it off his

body but anyway it's a pipe that that's

a little skull pipe that when you blow

into it it makes little skulls you don't

have to smoke anything it's just like a

novelty but I figured that would be fun

because where you come from it's like

all magic and stuff right yeah indeed

and I'm touched that you would offer

something with a personal touch to it

thank you very much you see his eyes get

a little bit misty oh also thank you for

making the the menthe cake every time I

eat one I feel extremely guilty always

that the Kate that you made out of

Warrington month you know we're not out

of that's not maybe that was just a

dream I had that one time it's it's only

it's just it's nice that's right artists

okay all I'm trying to say is that thank

you for trusting me with your time and

being here

and making this something special for

the people of Waterdeep it's been a home

and I haven't had a home in a really

long time and you all made it feel like

home and I just want to thank you and

you should probably ask do you for at

least a little bit of money well I don't

really get money but we want to thank

you

Strix auntie tricks for you know letting

us come here and learn how ties are made

I never knew such a thing as a PI could

exist and then I found this bakery I'm

thinking straight while selling me out

to the Raven Queen she'd probably give

you a lot of money for me we don't have

a really good relationship with her I

met her and she was not really that nice

so she's awful yeah I know that politan

likes her but you know a lot of people

that Politan likes I don't really get

along with I got along with Bolton I got

a lot of pulse in but a lot of the

people anyway regardless this has been a

good place for all of us and in the

future I hope that we can still continue

to be a good place and she looks over

and one of the tables that the guests

are sitting on is on fire and she's just

like maybe we can take care of that

that's the smartest table now just

create industry water is raining on them

I have a feeling that there's umbrellas

underneath the table just for like these

instance and one of the like patrons

just sit through Brella well it rains

what the blogger is watching that then

for like terms aside he's got this giant

handkerchief you just hear this

trumpeting sound as he blows his nose

still like being thought of

oh and as the rain falls in the Waffle

House and the cumin continues to feed

the hungry patrons of Waterdeep ælis

small home for the wayward creatures

that live there will continue to fall

apart until one day it will be rebuilt

again and that's where we'll stop thank

you yeah and thank you for being a part

of the coven and enjoy

all of these wonderful times with me I

hope you enjoyed your tiny dungeon crawl

adventure into the tombs of Waterdeep

we've got so much loot please don't tell

Deus anything that you took it's

probably true yeah it's probably true Oh

didn't dear nae take all the money

herself yes or doesn't understand money

yes she care about it he does like his

the usual shopping and then he's like

I'm getting all this wonderful life

experience this is fantastic I'm just

gonna put the mirror in to Evelyn's room

so the mirror is or no Yvonne's room is

destroyed so the mirror is now just in

the tap room it's just me represent

break relax like just yeah it's the it's

the self-affirmation mirror so yeah yeah

the waffle crews been rubbing off on him

for sure yeah it's it's perfect all

right well if there's anything else

you'd like to say about your characters

like what what do they continue doing

after after this adventure are they

still hanging out at the coven making

pies er

oh yeah it's I think critter just keeps

doing the same thing every day like he

doesn't really have a concept of like

future plans just life just sort of is

one day at a time so you know now he has

this this new maturity about it yeah

relax not going anywhere anytime soon

he's like for him this is like

short-term but it's gonna end up being

like probably 15 years of like no

ambition to move up just like doing this

menial job as like a learning experience

kind of thing so I'll pretty much do the

same thing day in and day out for the

next foreseeable future for sure you

know he's just trying to find his place

in the world

yeah just like learn a bit a little bit

before it goes back to run the

bed-and-breakfast back home it's lovely

how about tea or nut she definitely

still works at the bakery but now that

she also has seed money

she is also starting an independent

hoverboard selling business perfect

because she doesn't sleep so she also

has time to do crime cool

can she give jinx one of those

hoverboards because I feel like thanks

probably like one she she could give

jinx

maybe jinx really wants one but she just

continues to say no and I think she

would give it to him if she if Jenks let

her teach him some magic okay that's

very he would let her do that you study

enough then you get the hoverboard right

yeah yeah I would help but the

hoverboard is just a floating disc but

just a skateboard yeah exactly her also

yeah besides like fashion and

personality was the one way that the

waffle crew is rubbed off on her luck is

that where all of his spells originally

were like things having to do with fire

and water and food he now prepares

everyday mass healing word no perfect

yeah that would that's really helpful

especially since the like v break in by

like five different criminal

organizations it's changed his morning

routine somewhat realizing oh I should

probably like prepare for the worst

yeah perfect perfect but yeah so the

coven continues unhindered until until

the future so why don't you all go

through and tell everyone what exciting

things you are doing in your life or if

you want to promote anything or talk

about anything and go ahead yeah well
