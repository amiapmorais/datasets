welcome to the 50th episode of dice

camera action yes I think we get this

far did you okay

that's like 300th episode in waffle crew

weeks yeah as a special treat for

hitting session 50 chris has made us all

level 50 well you shouldn't have I

didn't have 49 more sessions and is a

good job guys 49 yeah no one is more

surprised than me so to kick off the

50th session I thought it would be a

little bit fun before we jump into the

game just to ask you guys the players ah

if you can recall any memorable moments

from this campaign so far that leap into

your head there's so many thing yeah

just like what what's the first things

that spring to mind when you think about

what's happened so far hold on let me

think about all the things I went right

oh when my adopted son was murdered oh

yeah that was cool or when my new bird

friend was murdered that was pretty cool

when I was murdered yeah that's it Chris

Perkins giveth Chris Perkins taketh away

yeah yeah

I love the wagon ride at the at the end

of language you're escaping barodia and

like we kind of got a recap of all the

horrible things that happens and then

Isaac was trying to grab through the

wagon and it was just horrific people

always bring this one up but probably

one of the most profound D&D moments I

ever had was when I wasn't sure whether

my character had eaten a human child

that was like the pit of my stomach felt

weird after that that episode yeah all

right and their relief when she didn't

uh uh I don't want to do that never

forget your face

oh my gosh also I'll never forget

Chris's face when I did the whole person

oh yeah on arena oh my god to her dad

well like she'll still be oh that was

when we the character of the waffle crew

really became solidified I think was

that moment when we you know helped

arena that donning moment it's like oh

we are incompetent creative non

conscious right yes I still love giant

tree fight yeah that was one of the best

that is like one of the few examples of

one that did go right you know that was

like we actually feel badass right now

I'm cool and we all work together and

did cool things together that was

awesome

hasn't happened since oh uh who's the

dude who hit on p√∂lten the whole time

oh that was good Asher I'm sorry oh yeah

that was another one when we had our

little Twilight reenactment definitely

really hot yes I love Alton's

interactions with straw on to worst ah

every single guest person that we've

ever had

yeah and subsequently caused her murder

actually yeah evil ins friendship with

Dee was a really really fun one too and

kind of unexpected they have a serious

like sis man's going on sister bromance

I don't know what the word for that is

but I do hope she's okay laughter she's

fine

I like oh I like that uh that one guy

who was in the castle that I've made

friends with that I got to just let me

out of jail and like know is like all

right cool

yeah usual yeah I like when when we have

little like things that our characters

want that we think are ridiculous and

then Kris lets them happen like on a

much smaller scale than that like when

even got to have a new designer set of

clothes made by the dwarves like orange

starts really wanted the owl bear as a

friend yes exactly

um uh we still were a little bear so I

mean hey America I hug on strix live at

twitchcon Oh

oh yeah you just hate it so much but

it's also absolutely character the whole

time that was so good

it was super fun I'm glad I didn't get

any of you like vicariously dirty

I actually I also have to say that I

really like the UM recent salamander

inside the nine pound hell hound moment

oh my god

feeding the frog to the album yeah it's

not like one of those things where

you're playing a video game and you're

like I wonder if this will break it to

something yeah no answers yes yes it was

broke yeah sorry about that BAM yeah I

liked the moment when palton was on the

roof with Van Rycke tan it's like will

he or won't he

oh yeah whoo that was good yeah yeah

Chris what are some of your favorites

cuz we talked about ours a lot but oh

geez there's so many I can't even name

them I like I like simple little things

a little character moments like when

Strix has a hissy fit and falls or or

just things that have have memorable I

can remember the reactions like for

instance when Simon aka murder bot shot

the little kid in the neck and yes we're

all just like oh and somehow out of that

you decided he needs to be your friend

did all of us felt that way I'm all you

did when Nate named Simon I love that

moment like because none of us were

expecting it all of a sudden he just

like had obviously been thinking about

it for a while and it came out all that

was so precious yeah we're just like

wait you just named him Jeff is so sweet

but my absolutely favorite moment was

that time that yeah

really fire primordial from the iron

flask was that that was that way okay

let's do it

there's a very artful segue I wasn't

about that yeah that was last week it

turns out things were going very

well with the distraction force taking

on the hellhounds and the fire Giants as

they poured out of the mountain and DF

was inside with his best bud drow Cozens

or Lauren with the iron flask drew

mogera out of the adamantine Forge into

the flask and then trotted upstairs to

find the slaves and upon finding them

realized they were all locked up in

cages so he uncorked the flask

mogera poured out to her full 50-foot

height a blazing fiery wrath creature

that filled the room and promptly began

to just cause everything around her to

spontaneously combust and melt DF yes

I'm Katie Dodd you take you take 35

points of fire damage question was the

same on this by any chance no Oh as

mogera erupts before you and fills the

room with flame you can't even look at

her you've got like your hands up in

front of your face and you can feel all

the skin burning off the palms of your

hands when you do and burning your face

burning your clothes burning everything

you also see through the smoke and flame

what appeared to be the slaves around

you burst uh and then quickly just get

absolutely cremated or your eyes huh if

this flask is working properly you know

that mogera is under your control right

on our the problem is you can't stand to

be anywhere near her what do you do uh

ill take this you know that you're going

to continue to take this damage yeah I

need to get away obviously so

I I do so okay make up a like back down

the stairs and as I'm heading out I'll

shout to her like just like severely

burns I'm like trying to half cover my

eyes and try to see where I'm supposed

to go well I'll still like holding my

just entirely like burned wounded body

and having it just difficult to move

yeah okay as you retreat back down the

corridor away from mogera you get to the

portcullis leading out to the the iron

gantry above the assembly area and

easily squeeze through the bars of the

portcullis yeah I'm gonna want to show

to her is there way does she get out

from where put her um

you believe that mogera is kind of

amorphous that is to say that she can

her she can alter her form okay great so

then as I'm like heading out back

towards the like main area I'll like

shout to her that but they're a rising

high a pond in the center of the furnace

is the adamantine heart and that shall

be the target of all your wrath cast

yourself upon it and melts melted and

what language do you speak this in

tongues can't now I only have common

okay

heystop um if it helps I'll try to like

point at the direction alrighty but

okay so as you withdraw barking that

order

you can't tell immediately whether

mogera heard you and or understood you

all you can really hear is the horrific

sound of just the flames and heat coming

off her and the ripples in the air

around you as the temperature quickly

sores those that does that think we're

like the airs like wavy yeah from the

seeds yeah exactly

and you start to smell burnt melted iron

melted flesh and even molten rock at

this point and behind you you can see

what appear to be uh fiery cracks

forming in the walls as though she is

seeping into the mountain and turning it

all into molten slag oh geez great and

I'm leaving yep as you head down the

steps of the iron steps of the gantry

you can see behind you the gantry is

becoming superheated and turning red Oh

God okay uh you get to the bottom and

that it's at that point at the bottom

where you're very near to the open doors

leading outside these gigantic 80-foot

tall doors and you can hear sounds of

battle and barking hellhounds okay uh

puppies okay as it's still my initiative

or I yes okay uh I'll just simply I use

my cutting action - to help get out from

there okay and then heading towards the

battle uh mmm I guess I'll attempt

stealth just to make sure that they're

still focused on the threats in front of

them and now get going on behind them

make a stealth check I just didn't see

and get my dice right who wants to fill

me today ready okay

will they be able to smell your charred

flesh not when your stealth is 29 all

right

you even mask your smell like I covered

the crispy Diaz barks yep so let's

imagine I'm like practically living at

this point just from all the foot burn

wounds and yeah the station yeah there's

some smoke coming off you as you stand

in this gigantic doorway you see outside

with its back to you um what appears to

be a fire giant in full armor duking it

out with the dow stony giant on your

side okay and the dow is swinging harsh

nags great acts like he got that from

somewhere okay

you also see uh that Morning Glory is

running across the snowy fields with

hellhounds chasing out hey and you see

another pile of hellhounds with evil and

sort of sitting lying on top of them

legs sticking up in the air it looks

like they just got all knocked over by a

stiff wind or something senpai oh yeah

exactly and then the last thing you

notice is what appears to be a little

black chicken this sort of running

around in a circle near your feet okay

can I take a count for where all my

comrades are yes with the exception of

um Strix because you'll need to make a

perception check to see if you can spot

her though okay hiding of course peach

of a fiddle perception very good is

someone okay and make a high check with

advantage Strix all right oh wow okay

geez

nineteen okay so you do see Strix this

little black shape idea behind a snowy

snowdrift okay so at least no I didn't

send them to their desks cool

no not yet

all right then I guess I'm good yeah

okay uh next up in the initiative order

news uh let's see that was garroted 20

so next up is Strix oh boy uh so

chickens taken care of I kind of feel

bad for it now that it's a chicken

though what I'm not gonna it's not going

to look bad towards so it turned it into

like a cockroach or something okay so

who is the hurry oh by the way I

miscounted there's actually three fire

Giants I'm not one okay so there's three

left yeah

all right um and evylyn is on top of the

hellhound she's invincible so I'm not

really worried about right she's

activated her armor so it's all shiny so

I know that's working I can basically be

a chew toy for as long as I want all

right

can can we see or can I see d/f who just

came in uh yeah he's not oh he's hiding

actually so no yeah 29 yeah invisible

there's no I have not that perceptive um

at all okay uh I will then look at one

of those did I you know what I don't

remember if I cast mage armor no I did I

did

you did I did okay cool yeah just

checking she didn't wanna mess that up

oh that's right I miss you stepped on

top of the door that's right oh I went

on Thomas I forgot about that

yeah so I moved from behind the wall

okay

d it still could have seen me hiding on

top of the thing yes

ah you just be closer to him than write

what it was originally said cool

um you know what I'm just going to try

so I don't really want to fight these

guys yeah I'm gonna try and polymorph

another one of the Giants okay so

whichever one hasn't really been

affected yes okay uh what do you what

are you aiming to turn that giant into

um

well I already did another chicken so

like maybe could I do like a baby chick

yeah okay like a cute little baby chicks

cuz it's not the big giant it's the

little one okay okay so you cast the

spell and your magic swirls around

another giant and it shrinks down this

tricks is just like oh right so now

there are two I hope the other chicken

sees the baby chicken and is like

chasing it they're probably too far

apart to notice it to be able to

interact with one another at this point

okay and you're gonna stay where you are

uh yeah I'll read just right above I'm

trying to just like survey the area and

like just make sure that no one can get

me like the dogs or the Giants or

anything so palton you pick yourself up

out of the snow after being pounced on

by the dogs and blowing them back with a

thunder wave along with evylyn you

weren't particularly discriminating

against her that point cuz you knew she

was invulnerable to damage

so there's nothing yep there's nothing

actively threatening you right now

but you can see there are still a bunch

of hellhounds running around and two

left in the battle

okay um so I'm just for your records you

used up a fourth level thunder wave

spell well okay let's see okay so to

fire Giants yeah

hellhounds running around yep you leave

for for one for one day literally

everything is on fire I mean literally

it's that

um it's that it's that gift from

community here yeah okay um so so what

what threat is closest to me the closest

threats to you would be the pile of

three hellhounds that evylyn is heaped

in with okay uh uh how far are they they

are currently 15 feet away from you okay

so they're like right there alright um

let's see I'm sorry we're internet thing

so something I'm not sure of but does

crown of matter describe magnets need to

be on a humanoid yes okay um are you

thinking one of the hellhounds or a

chicken my chickens like way away okay

okay so the chickens the fire the fire

Giants return to the chickens yeah the

one was just as you watched right now

transformed into a little baby chicken

there the larger one is Duke salt oh

yeah this chat keeps asking uh weather

didn't two of the fire Giants run away

oh thank you yes they did because

actually paltin you you used another

spell your fourth level fear spell

oh well that's right I forgot about them

they got is the great book keeper yeah

so they ran they ran off into the

mountains so right now there are no fire

Giants but still two chickens that's

better that's better than two fire

Giants is none yeah um okay let's go

ahead and

did rule but you can have a pet

hellhound hmm then it's just lost your

bird then is just gonna die it's cereal

so maybe that's maybe that's the best

way to go about it mom this is my Pat

now wait for it to die I'm gonna I'm

gonna go ahead and up use artic

inspiration on v1 excellent

alright so even you hear the inspiring

music coming from paltin um surest rat

tunes

yeah so to give you a an extra d8 I

believe then alright and now it's the

bad guys turn the hellhounds we'll get

to their feet and attack you um

evylyn but their their jaws and flames

do nothing to you I'm like letting them

chew on my arms like ah yeah uh Morning

Glory is still leading the other three

hellhounds off the hinterland that's

good maybe they'll become friends yeah

um how many minutes do I have left

because I know that this only lasts for

ten minutes my own vulnerability you

have almost you have them almost a bulk

of the ten minutes left

you've had it up operating for a couple

rounds so not even a minute yet so there

are no imminent threats other than these

hellhounds that I'm playing with right

you do know that the the frost sorry the

fire Giants who ran away as a result of

palton sphere spell will eventually

regain their senses and return okay then

I I have two or three puppies uh you

have uh let's say let's say two or left

okay um I cast command and I point

toward toward where the fire Giants just

went and I'm only allowed to use a

one-word command so technically game

wise it would be attack but what even

wants to say is Sikkim bolus and and

command

them to attack the fire Giants that are

leaving okay so your command spell will

affect I wanna cast it as a second level

oh so that I can infect you got it I was

just about to ask ya uh so they have to

make saving through simply yes wisdom

Sammy throws

what's your safety see Emma oh yeah I

have to always look at it because I

always forget sixteen okay uh your

command takes hold

yay yes so on they're on their next

basically right now

they will trot off this lets us in the

direction that you're pointing mark look

you can't actually stipulate a target

for them to attack if you can't see if

they can't see what the target is but

they're running off in the direction

that you pointed okay alright uh that

brings us around to horik uh he now is

looking at a little baby chick uh he'll

pick it up in his stony hand delicately

heard it and just sort of uh a little

sort of plant his axe in the plant the

axe on the ground or drop it on the

ground and just sort of hold the chick

in his hands and and look around to see

uh where strix is cuz he's you know who

did this he just doesn't know what she

wants done with the chance

and that takes us back to DF DF behind

you you can hear what sounds like the

dripping iron of a gantry falling down

onto the floor you can also feel the

heat inside the forge start to become

more intense yes so mogera itself is

basically melting like the entire inside

like the rocks and everything like that

she's like the place is coming down

typical walk look yeah now the mountain

is enormous of course right um but if

not now eventually I Kirsch II will just

melt something and eventually cover the

heart we also know that it the heart

explodes right yeah

assuming she goes in that direction yeah

or if nothing else maybe she'll melt the

piece of the colossi or whatever so if

it doesn't get to the heart well I'll be

at least vile heck of a lot of time

alright um so current thrust single

hellhound left on evylyn both of those

how how are all the hellhounds that are

currently on evil and are running in

your direction Oh oops

I will stay hidden okay I thought you

might okay okay strike Strix you didn't

know sign fault from your vantage point

on the mountain side Strix you can see

Clark he's picked up your little baby

chicken holding it looking around for

you doesn't know where you are there's

no imminent danger to any of your

friends except perhaps the two

hellhounds running inside the mountain

because you don't all right don't know

where DF is alright um they're clearly

under the effect of evil ins magic right

so I can see that pretty much most of

the threats have left except for our

good friend Carrick who I we had a

discussion about earlier yep

um I really do not trust him so at all

so uh man that's not a good easy thing

to do though well I might do something

stupid uh since I'm seeing him not

looking at me and looking around I'm

gonna try and banish him oh I'm in which

I use my sorcery points for but I'm

gonna try and banish him oh my goodness

okay he was he is within range and he

must make a charisma saving through

which I know he's probably got a pretty

good charisma but I'm willing to take

that chance

all right let's find out because I don't

want him to get that iron golem because

I know that things are gonna get even

worse if he runs in there and takes it

that's my logic is plus six on this role

I know your DZ is 1716 Oh fifteen okay

okay here comes comes uh all right uh so

this is let's see if the target is

native to the plane you banished it to a

harmless Emmy playing aah blah blah blah

blah remains there until the spell and

so up to a minute okay right so um

quizzically uh he sort of looks around

and then disappears yes yes the little

chick in the air tries to fly but can't

it just fall blopps down into the cell

Thanks

leaves a little chick sized hole in the

snow yes sir that can I just scream time

to run

which everybody hears yeah and that's

that's returned and you can I guess move

away from the mountain now strikes if

you want yeah I'm just gonna jump down

from the wherever my perches and just

look for everyone who's going time to

run okay so everybody sees Strix kind of

in the doorway entrance area not too far

from the black chicken ranting and then

paltin yeah there so there are currently

no immediate threats to you in the

vicinity all the Giants and/or

hellhounds have run away this seems like

a good time to leave

sounds good to me

Strix is already running to be here just

like away me no dear this out yet so

yeah just big enough no none of us know

about death right

you see strikes running I'm just like

guess we're going not waiting and I will

proceed that way okay yes so you start

to veer off in the direction that Strix

is running away from the mountain and uh

for both like Kermit running okay and at

the point evylyn you can see in the

mountainside to the left of the giant

doors and a little bit higher than them

a crack opens in the mountain and all of

this molten uh lava comes belching out

by the Holy See reasonable stay in

darkness and I started to see like damn

yeah and I'm like flying around the

entrance kind of looking trying to see

it in I'm calling Vidya make a make a

perception check na the perception is

characteristically low out of seven okay

you don't immediately see D F but deeper

inside the assembly area you can see

that the UH that one of the fire giants

that paulten scared away with his fear

spell has broken its hold and is coming

back toward you through those come out

of the entrance he's deep he's about

sixty feet inside the mountain and

heading your way he's about sixty feet

away from you at this point but coming

in your direction

you also see at this point that the the

two hellhounds that Ewan spelled have

are no longer under the effect of the

command spell and are just kind of

waiting for him I fly higher out of

reach continue to yell for D F and look

around

okay D F you do see that one of the fire

Giants driven back into the mountain is

coming forward in your direction okay

returning to fight the your friends and

obviously you hear evil and calling out

free all right is this my initiative and

uh yes it is

all right great uh I'll like get out of

hiding so that I can be shown to evil

and she knows where I am okay uh I'll

just look those fire Giants figure out

that eventually they got way bigger

problems to be good than us so like

she'll seed like she's just like

completely burned like the cloak and

stuff he's been by was like and sheared

off and like closers tattered and laughs

like burnt skin showing I'll just shut

up to her rod now and like just cutting

action - chase after Strix like kind of

half whipping through the snow uh

literally out of nowhere evil and you

see DF come out of the shadows badly

badly burned whoa

we can see you there um I take up the

rear behind him cuz I'm invulnerable so

I'm like back to des flying backwards

like ready to take on whatever's chasing

us okay um you see

death is like fighting back tears in his

eyes yeah from pay nurse otherwise okay

we'll the the fire giant who is emerging

from the depths is not moving faster

than dia so that's a good sign um he's

clunking along in his heavy iron armor

and as he advances toward you evylyn and

you're covering for your friends escape

you suddenly see this humongous fire

creature fifty feet tall maybe 50 60

feet long you're not sure if how many

limbs it has but it's more than four and

it comes landing in the middle of the

assembly area amid the wreckage of the

Colossus literally on top of this fire

giant who is now just engulfed by it

sloth the fire giant does not seem to be

harmed by the fires of this creature at

all but he is mightily confused morning

Lord protect us and you just feel this

incinerating heat come blasting out at

you in your face and you think you would

actually take damage were you not

invulnerable good thing I am I'm like

over my shoulder I'm like run faster you

see your little friends running flying

whatever moving through the snow far far

farther away maybe even like grab Dias

cloak and I'm like flying and pulling in

like um okay make sure like it's the

scene from Lord of the Rings where

they're all like walking on the mountain

with the panning except for we're

running and panicked and the music is

just not happy at all screaming but it's

so really dramatic right yes it's the

helicopter pan yes as you withdraw from

the mountain you see that the neither

the hellhounds around it or the

hellhounds inside it nor the fire giant

are emerging they apparently do have

bigger problems to solve but you can see

an incredible bright light like Sun like

in its brightness emanating from the

open doorways at the base of the

mountain even as you move farther away

and um you can see the heat distortion

coming out through the opening like a

cone and just melting all the snow

around it I quietly hum distractions

alright um you are able to retreat to

what you consider to be a safe enough

distance that nothing you don't fear

like anything is pursuing you or in

danger suing it but by this time also a

minute has ended and you're pretty sure

that your banishment spell has as well

ah I just don't say anything and just

like cover my head I mean I tell

everyone that it's probably undated

alright and about a minute after that

you can all see uh flying in the air

toward you is Couric his lower body

trailing off from about the waist down

into a tornado of sand oh look it's our

friend

there's no good yeah he's got he's got

harsh and eggs big great axe he's gonna

access in the faces over his back dance

do you have the you know a thing as in a

good heart good heart D uh also

concerned about running away

yep so let us all roll initiative again

Oh God

as you're applauding for the snow I was

fun

trudging away from Carrick uh oh

by g20 house use this one at least I

bought us some time

yes you did and he didn't get the golem

13:08 'ln I got a or eight sorry okay

yeah nine and paltin nineteen excellent

alright um so Carrick continues um

flying toward you he gets to about I'll

say a hundred and twenty feet away

um Halton do you want to do anything at

that point I don't know do I

um what soul I don't I don't like this

suggestion leave us alone I doubt

that'll work

okay how far is this this this

Feiler he's 220 feet away and about 60

feet up oh okay I'm gonna go ahead and

uh does it does it feel like we're still

running yes that feels good yeah good

but because your because essentially

you're running through Mountain still so

it's quite deep you're sinking in it's

it's quite a slog I just love the image

of paltin like examining as he's walking

like haha yeah this feels right yeah I

will just carry on okay you just look

back I feeling nope nope nope alright

evylyn you want to do anything hmm

right now you're just riding literally

on yes um we're just pulling on his

cloak charlie hotels

yeah um I have approximately five

minutes left of invulnerability uh you

would have about eight minutes left

oh nice okay um how close is he to

catching us he's a hundred and twenty

feet away and he definitely sees us and

is pursuing us yes you're easy to follow

because you're leaving big tracks

through the snow mmm

um dang it I guess I keep running

because there's no reason for me to like

break off cuz he's not gonna follow me

so I just keep pulling but I yell is

there a way to contain us or contain him

like a hut or something alright

and uh we come down to DIAC okay a 120

feet away mm-hmm that's pretty far now

yep

well his movement this fact flight speed

wasn't great if I recall now we can run

forever that's a good solution

yeah he'll catch up to you as long as

you're waiting through snow alright uh

if my companions are close enough to

hear me I'll just say uh not yet keep

moving okay can do yep that seems to be

a plan Strix what do you do okay this is

it having a sit yeah because Strix is

gone she's yeah mentally and physically

gone uh so you all continue to run away

when the DAO um moves to within 60 feet

of you guys he says my friends you have

disappointed me we had a deal and he

says sorry Strix is just screaming says

stop your running we must go back to the

mountain now the mountains kind of gone

I mean he he says it is right there

he's not going anywhere it was like it's

going oh it's going don't you see the

lava coming out of it there is a little

lava bubbling out of cracks in the sides

of the mountain yes I think usually

people run when a mountain is about to

explode with lava totally not leaving

yeah just resume we're leaving just

still running he says please stop

running away I don't want to hurt you

I'll feel bad if I have to kill you all

I heard that one before but Willy

I actually believed him did you inside

check in where you just believe him I

actually believe him believe him that

he'll kill us that doesn't want to hurt

us but yeah anyway all right Oh face it

it is now we're back to palton who I

assume unless you tell me otherwise Nate

you're still running but Jeanne is now

60 feet away from you

I just like quick look around at my part

I'm just like okay what are we doing I

can go talk to them you can't hurt me

right now buddy all right but do you

have a plan

cuz he's definitely catching up to us

yep and you don't look like you can run

so good don't forget that you can take

your armor away in an instant ooh he can

probably choke you or something with it

too

that's I've come under the snow uh he's

60 K I'm gonna don't hurt a flan or

something you keep shaking your head at

me and winking and you're looking all

weird is there something I should know

am I still running with strix at this

point I she's nearby yes yeah she also

has ducked under the snow yeah she just

dive-bombed in the snow oh okay so now

I'm just out here like yeah cool um well

she's hiding then we're not running I

guess I'll

hang all right cuz I don't know what

we're doing

yes you stop a cold mountain wind blows

over you

snow catches your cloak and your hair as

you turn and look to your friends and go

bland doesn't seem established we'll

await further instructions all right uh

evylyn you're up next after paltin um if

paltin stops i also stop and take a

defensive stance and then i start

yelling at d athens tricks I'm like what

are you guys winking about what's going

on there's something in my eye

[Laughter]

idea okay

everyone else is stopped running it

seems that they have yes I don't know

what's going on all right good

so then death will kind of stumble

forward and like I'll fall into the snow

a little bit and pick himself up and

turn around face crack holding his

wounds but now that his kind of lower

body is like and right hand is kind

underneath snow and kind of covered uh

and just kind of holding himself waiting

for Clark to approach get closer so we

can discuss and now let him know exactly

what went down

okay so DF is now sort of ahead of you

guys in a looking to confront the genie

as he approaches uh and then Strix

you're under the snow and staying there

yeah uh yeah absolutely

I'm staying under the snow all right uh

Kihara clans touches down right in front

of you DF the sand gives way to real

pair of legs underneath him so he is now

standing in the snow towering over you

with his 9 foot and foot height with

harsh negs big axe just kind of slung

over his shoulder the way a lumberjack

might kind of non-threatening Lee I'm

kind of nonchalantly actually and he

says the mountain is over there

it's exploding its that hurts people

like us so we ran away but now we're all

safe isn't that grand you say he looks

at the mountain again he says it's fine

solidity of tide go back and finish the

quest that I am so DF well at this point

we'll say the mounts coming down and I

don't know how much time we have left

you look badly burned my friend I know

that's why we can't go back right now

Couzens betrayed us he did this to me I

was able to fend him off and he has left

I don't know where he went

however your iron golem is currently

inside he says he was a dark elf

of course he betrays that's what I said

well I kind of like almost like pointing

to my ruins I even say it's like I know

I was expecting it but not to this

caliber he says you can't allow these

small setbacks to get in the way of our

mission yeah it's this a very big

setback in there he says and she's

eating the golem back is very important

to me it is worth your life I'm afraid I

know and it's worth your life too but

someone knows yourself should have no

fear of the fire inside I've cleared the

path you can easily go richer get claim

it on your own you no longer need us I

can't move it he says I need you to help

me there's always the possibility that I

could find myself cornered by giants you

did not kill them all

so you need to do what we agreed and

help me out

the Giants are distracted they should be

paying no attention to you or something

as small as the iron girl and while the

rest of their stronghold and their

precious project melts around them and

he says I do not know what became of the

golem after we left it in the assembly

area

did you see it there it wasn't there I

saw it on my descent down when I first

entered the mountain well then I will

need your help to find it I can give you

simple directions it'll be easy to find

no I don't think so we had an agreement

[Music]

yeah we did

because piracy conspiring with treason

was never part of the agreement and I'll

uncork the flask and say is he heareth

yes to make a wisdom saving throw

Evon doesn't know what that means still

right like she's not aware of the whole

class thing uh she knows of the flask

and its power but she didn't know that

was the plan and she was present when

vir a--the tried to use the flask to

trap her ik this morning so I did know

that he could do that but I didn't know

he was going to do that right you've

already seen Couric once uh defend

himself against the power of this flask

okay alright and you just saw him do it

again ah that's not good ah all right

so he says yes I will have to take that

flask from you now uh so that was Diaz

turn tricks you technically go after

death and initiative work so picking up

a guess no yeah yeah held the flask up

to traffic and the genie just okay can I

pass one of my scroll spells from my

spell book I found and cast a greater

invisibility on D F uh yes I believe you

can as I don't want I don't want him to

get the flask cuz you can just keep

doing it d just keep just open it up yep

you will have to go and touch D F to

turn him invisible okay um can I crawl

through the snow yes yeah

this little snow burro comes over to

Dina we hand reaches now touches him by

the Scorch ankle yeah yeah and then

after I do that I would like to uh my

misty step away though I have enough

action travel uh yeah you can cross you

can crawl you can do your spell and then

you can misty step away that's what I

want to know yeah okay so very far away

here you got your 30 feet away okay yeah

you are now greater invisibility which

means that you are invisible um for a

minute

until then and you stay invisible even

if you attack and whatnot so nice nice

okay

that's strictest turn and the Bolton

you're next

okay so this Jean man yes hey you know

um how far is he oh he's he was right

next to DF he's probably like 15 feet

away from you okay and uh sir is there

anything else around I make a perception

check can do is anything besides Vicks

piles of snow around you that would be a

seven okay you just see big piles of

snow everywhere neat you're having a

hard time seeing too because the wind is

sort of blowing snow up in your face and

visibility isn't great

Nate chat demands that because I'm

looking at it that I tell you and remind

you that you have the sunny curses which

I'm sure you know so there you go chat

stop that's true so how so how exactly

would that work because I feel like I

like mist like exactly what the curse is

like do um so one of the curses that you

can do is you can try to render someone

blind or deaf that's one of the ones

you've done before okay

there are yeah that thing where you can

make them horrible for certain stuff

yeah you can make it at the tree yes you

can make it you can make him vulnerable

to a particular kind of damage like

slashing or piercing or thunder means he

would take double damage from those

kinds of effects

okay um I guess like we'll try to try to

blind him then okay he will have to make

me saving through resist this effect so

you utter Avis Thani curse an ancient

curse upon him to deprive him of his

vision and he rolled the natural twenty

so that's not going to hurt cool him in

any way now you still have movement if

you want yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm

gonna move more away from him okay so

you go kind of tromped tromping through

the snow away from him uh make a just

make a dexterity check for me

okey-dokey okay Oh neat

that would be a five okay as you run

away you trip over something else

recently buried in the snow as you fall

down and land around it you can see what

appears to be a giant frozen bird oh

that's way worse I'm on a strict smells

gonna be comical but no it's sad and he

recognizes this is the this is the bird

that plucked you from danger off the

mountainside when things were looking

dire I disfrutan bro just like yeah it

seems about right and then you see like

what's gonna be little uh poisoned drow

crossbow bolts sticking out of it so I

know that's what they are yeah cuz

you've seen the drought crossbow bolts

recently it's like yep yep that seems

about right cool

okay well it wouldn't wouldn't be

Tuesday so evylyn you saw Paul move a

little bit away from rest the group and

then fall in the snow I guess I actually

have this epiphany I'm like parents son

or maybe it's me

Oh everything huh Oh dad it's like if I

survive this I'm gonna I'm gonna sleep

on this okay anyway back to dying yep

back to dying yep evylyn ah the attempts

to curse Couric and the attempt to trap

into the flash does not seem to have met

with his approval I I kind of just like

fly up a little bit from where cuz I was

standing right next to dia yes so I kind

of fly up a little bit more toward the I

line of of our jeanne friend and um I

try to make friendly you know chit chat

with him to try to convince him that we

like didn't want to leave him so I'm

like I'm so sorry it's just such a big

misunderstanding I think we just you

know we were so scared of that lava and

I think death just I think he's burned

to a crisp I think his brain is not

quite working some I'm very sorry about

that that was very rude and we're just

you know don't worry we're all friends

here we'll get this figured out I'm just

going to try to like persuade him not to

hurt us so I'm trying to I'm trying to

make a persuasion check go ahead make

your persuasion check I roll the two and

my persuasion is +8 so even though the

two it's a 10 but freaking freaking dice

you're going to the shame bag guys okay

uh he says to I am very very sorry that

you put me in these difficult position

as much as I don't want to hurt you

afraid you've left me with no choice he

snaps his fingers and your armor

disappears I'll bring his axe upon you

evylyn uh question great deal I didn't

mean to get close enough for him to

melee me yeah and because yes invisible

so you're the closest thing to him so he

will just stride over a couple steps in

swing at you with this big axe

he rolls a 23 on the attack roll which

hits your unarmed enemy

yeah alright um and you are a human

mm-hmm and harsh nags great axe does an

extra two D twelve points of damage to

you why though

Wow it was made to kill humans um

alright you take you take 28 points of

slashing damage I'm just a flesh wound

from the first swing oh no I forgot out

inspiration Oh

[Laughter]

Bartek is on the top of my sheep oh well

strictly by the rules Anna no but since

I'm a generous DM I'm going to let you

roll if you want to watch me roll a 1

this time do you want me to I can do so

I can keep it okay what are the odds

what are the odds that it would be a 2

again oh well hey guys Anna Anna the

inspiration die is a d8 that you roll

and add to your previous add yes oh yeah

I thought it was just a normal

inspiration okay so you roll a d8 well

you want me to roll again cuz 2 is

technically still on a d8 you can roll

again okay honey lots of Mulligan's here

cut for her submissive 1414 total all

right um sadly that's not enough to well

we try to turn the Dow that you betrayed

back a favor

um so his first attack hits you his

second attack hits you and does does 41

okay wait so 23 plus 41 plus 41 woo now

we were doing so well for a total of

before right evylyn does not look well I

think she would okay so two big swings

of hashtags great acts and that's done

and DF you are invisible and your up are

kind of stepped past you to get to evil

in a little bit so you're kind of behind

him right now I don't know a whole lot

about Dow or other uh non primal beings

I can't imagine stabbing them is the

best option here so can I can I attempt

the flask again am I allowed to do that

as much as possible uh dot C or we could

just give up there is there is nothing

stopping you from attempting it again

okay if he had been trapped in the flask

previously he would have advantage on

his safe okay but he hasn't so just

normal type correct all right well he

just want a out of evylyn yep see I

think even like hit a tree and fell in

the snow with a plop yeah there's

there's no other train or other read

like just around snow and then yeah yeah

basically on a barren mountainside

sloping away from the mountain so there

is a slight incline toward the mountain

but yeah you're just making your way

through essentially snowy rocky terrain

right great I am NOT going to move in so

he doesn't see any footprints moving

away okay uh just to help hopefully make

myself a little more conspicuous and

then since he's looking yet even right

at the back of his stupid head and point

that flat form and just whisper very

quietly it's serious

alright he has to make another

I'm saving through still a he is

not drawn into the flask David what what

kind of saving through wasn't it wisdom

someone make him dumber and so he

resisted TV and he says stop doing doing

what I was the way I just ring her up oh

I see him do that to evil and I'm just

like oh no come on

so if she's still alive and she's still

alive yes yes okay I just hear yes

perfect like a bloody pile yeah you see

what levander preserves me little winged

boots Oh God

great oh so I'm just gonna go over there

and just kind of like again under the

snow yeah it's like and uh

spill like I'm gonna turn you into a

cloud just stay away from that guy he's

like real bad news okay

so salt then and I'll turn her into a

cloud okay you are a cloud mmm okay yeah

and uh palton what do you do that's a

good question um you sort of pick

yourself up out of the snow you look

back you can see the genie is not

currently fighting anybody

after swatting even out of the sky all

right you wouldn't have heard d/f

whispering the command word for the

flasks and you can't see him so you

don't where he is I'm gonna try and

persuade him okay so you do have a

better rapport than the others because

he spent some time with you you've got

those charming glasses or whatever the

heck they were you do have eyes if that

is true I'm trying to Lenny you'll like

that you have Paul's sort of standing up

brushing the snow off and like pulling

out his spectacles and slip

oh yeah like dude

yes your crystal uh spectacles have

three charges you can expend a charge as

an action to cast charm person this guy

is not technically a person hmm actually

affect him but you can still be very

persuasive when you want to because

you're a bard okay I will try to

persuade him okay all right so let's see

here

[Applause]

[Music]

[Laughter]

I consider persuading him I just do a

never mind

ah give him the bird um okay so a paltin

abandons his face when he realizes no I

like go to actually be persuasive and I

like choke on spit or something just

like hey yeah you just sort of sneeze

and snot is like hanging out of your

nose

yeah okay uh he doesn't seem too

interested in hearing we have to say

people in your evil in Europe so I as a

cloud can't like cast spells or take any

actions or make myself not a cloud right

I'm just a cloud you are just a cloud

that moves ten feet around faster if you

that's it

and I can't I don't have any agency over

being a cloud until you take me out of

being a cloud right no you can move like

you can so like I imagine if you don't

want to be a cloud anymore you can like

signal okay you can't talk so you can

just like wildly wave your cloud arm

wave like ah okay um I just go fly over

to stand next to everyone next up Alton

and okay is strix next deposit I know

Strix was over by you so if you go to

paltin you're leaving Strix but she's

buried under snow

yeah they I go I'll go over in your

palton okay so you are flying as a

evylyn cloud next called

okay I'm trying to keep as many of my

friends as possible within 10 feet of me

but okay okay all right and at this

point Couric brings his sort of turns

around to where the DF footsteps end and

he just takes a swing at the emptiness

you he is a disadvantage because he

cannot see you

he sucks real bad all right his low roll

is 19 what how does that fare against

Jeremy class Tia uncanny dodge mm-hmm

okay so he hits you and you reduce the

damage he does a 29 reduced to half

which is 14 but that's way it's not that

bad and then there's like this little

streak of blood across the snow got a

very clear streak blood and then you

just see the Snuggle slump SDS

unconscious body falls oh no I forgot

you already solo crap oh uh Kihara quill

um can't do much else cuz he can see

that you just went flop into the snow so

he's going to stride over to paltin and

stand before you paltin and he says we

have been through so many adventures

together to see it end these ways most

disheartening telling me

alright uh and then he will attempt to

bring his axe down upon you now he

rolled a natural one who did him sighs

angered failure yes uh so it's cuz his

kin his friendship he feels with

couldn't bring himself to really good oh

yes there was a moment of doubt he

brought the blade down to within like a

hair

you and he's just like this this pains

me I am overcome and then it is yes turn

he makes a death saving through okay if

I love every natural 20 my life this is

the time we survived a burning mountain

and now this 14 someone safe unsaved

alright Strix okay when he goes down

does the spell and uh it shouldn't know

can I make it end uh yes

okay so as soon as I see the blood yeah

I focus on making the spell end ok DF

becomes visible so I'm gonna misty step

on top of him okay and I'm gonna reach

it wherever that flask is grab it with

my dirty hand okay

I'm gonna pull it out and I'm gonna hold

it up that dumb stupid mean it's dumb

face I'm gonna hold it up and yell and

open the box again I'm really bad

alright Kihara cos sucked into the floor

strict rules op DF and roles are out of

the stoical yes evylyn kou silent cloud

waving Oh strict so you're not you're

not a cloud anymore as soon as I become

data cloud at you here Oh Oh dad I'll

stabilize DF by like I don't know

packing some snow into his wounds I run

over and I'll like I'll trade 11 play on

I I'm like I like SWAT her dirty hands

away lay on hands like sticking your

dirty hands

yeah like stopping of it like you've

done this one too many - no I'm just

don't touch nothing how many points

would you like to give to you

uh I'll give him just in case we happen

to run into initiative again I'll just

give him ten to get him started I just

need enough to uncanny dodge yeah all

right as DF springs to life you can see

quite a distance away from you now more

fissures more fiery fissures appear in

the mountainside of iron slag and you

can see one of the fissures seems to

crack its way up the mountainside toward

the actual village and there's another

sort of gout of magma that kind of

bleeds out of the mountain like a

flaming pus as I'm holding DF and like

laying hands on him I'm like it's so

nice that you got all those civilians

out of there before that mountain

exploded isn't that nice

is it so not the sort of the fiery

screams of all the dying slaves but you

you just sort of fills your head

so the best Ricci says ideas like me

like just pushes her off and gets up and

just says we need to keep moving

you know I quietly prays for his soul to

live and ER I'm just gonna stuff but the

flask somewhere in my robes okay you

have a long cold journey through the

winter waste lands north of Citadel ad

bar making your way southward in the

mountain as the mountain becomes a more

distant thing you can see kind of smoke

and ash billowing out of it but it's not

until you're about a day away when you

hear a thunderous sound from far to the

north and then suddenly great belching

smoke mounting up into the sky

and as we all look upon this site DLL

say you know Things Considered everyone

this was probably our most successful

stealth mission yet it's like the ground

is shaking and the loose trees are like

show you like yes pyroclastic clouds of

ash or washing down the mountain yes

yeah you think anyone heard that maybe

Bolton's got wives Cheers

even just kind of hums distractions all

right and by the time you make it back

to the the mountains to the south in

which Citadel ad bar is embedded you

guys are a bitter cold haggard tired and

all of that but you would have rested a

number of days before getting here so

you would be at least fresh on hit

points and abilities and whatnot that's

good yep

and yeah you've more or less eaten all

your food or or rationed out your food

so that you could get this far and then

you see the great stone causeway make

its way up the mountainside to the gates

of citadel ad bar and once inside you

are spared the cold winter and are

surrounded by stone halls heated by

great fiery braziers during the journey

back des was uncharacteristically silent

and to himself

yep periodically throughout the the cold

nights as you were sort of huddled under

snow or in mountain weight but not you

would hear the rest of you d/f kind of

murmuring or tossing and turning in his

sleep but that's about it

Strix is just assuming that something

else horrible happened to him he'll talk

when he's ready

dwarves who admit you through the gates

of citadel ad bar seem to be expecting

you because the gates open up before you

without even so much as questions and

once you're inside the gates you can see

a dwarven envoy group of dwarves

in big thick fur Mantle's come out to

greet you and among them Jasper

amar Kasim you can see that he has got

on a leash waffles the baby al bear and

in that in the the several days the week

or so that you have been away it might

just be an illusion or part of just glad

to see the the creature again but she

seems to have gotten like about 25%

bigger than she was the last usable I

like c'mere baby come see mama I do that

way I do that next to a vote of like I

like both of you to make this my

persuasion checks Oh beat this 21 actual

are you serious wait hold on

actually I'd like you all to make

charisma persuasion checks 23 I'm going

to give I'm going to give ya I'm gonna

give disadvantage to DF and palton

because they're not trying oh yeah check

this out crisper yeah oh that's so good

damn it uh 21 yeah 22 but cuz I got this

stone of luck hmm

I have a +8 to persuasion you still beat

I roll the 19 so 16 I'm looking at him

like duh

don't and she's like skiing all day I

sort of veering toward Pablo but no yeah

all right I wrote a 17 and a 19 if I had

19 I would had 24 all right so wha pose

hurls itself at Strix yay I probably

smell the grossest so I mean it's really

not about love yes can Strix hold

waffles now like what was pretty heavy

so that's what I'm thinking is like ken

strick see of it like does she get

fold-over uh yeah she probably does and

then the waffle starts picking through

her robe probably you know pulls off you

know one of her boots it starts rooting

around in there for Snicket II sneaks

windows like dollars that begin that we

ate

Amahl okay I think I do have a bat wing

though so I'll give her that

okay she'll eat the bat way take the

legs out don't get ill all right um so

there there are a number of dwarves who

are asking both in common and in dwarven

how your venture went and what what news

bring you from the north

well we go Jasper just sort of looking

over your shoulders to see if any of the

other slaves may have made it back with

you Oh dance will save will just say uh

oh dang it what was the ad bar Citadel

bars name again part off are not that's

it right all this just say is like we

need you to speak with heart often har

not alone uh and the dwarves nod and

Jasper says that can be arranged but to

help ease like the crowd uh I don't know

like was the general populace aware of

this threat intermission no just a

selection number of dwarves close to the

king

alright but I'm characteristically

friendly yes we're also gonna say to the

crowd but you won't need to worry about

any fire Giants anytime soon alright

Giants that bring us let's bring smile

week's but few weeks but there is no

like spark in his eye

okay that seems to put the dwarves at

ease they were hoping for some good news

and yes they will we'll take you to a

warm place where you can heat up a bit

and then they'll make sure that the king

is notified that you've returned great

[Music]

um as if we're if we do if we're kind of

like left alone or anything or we have

like a few moments to ourselves

yeah we'll sort of cut to a scene where

you guys are basically in a a chamber

with a large burning hearth and

comfortable leather padded chairs by

yourselves if we have time before then

I'll ask Alan where did you get your

clothes again oh it's uh what did I call

it I called it something ok it was like

what what was the suffix Kris there it

was like was it I hear is I what they

use here well depends on the family but

that it was a gnome I believe who did

your clothes right I know it was like

Gucci I in products it was something

like that well you gr they said you got

your yard yeah these are Gucci are ya

all right I can show you where it is

Albert I'll go with evylyn to return the

same place and just tell that seamstress

there seems to just can you remake this

but it's not exact exact same outfit I

just need it back uh yeah they will

they'll give it a once-over and they say

that they they they can procure all the

materials to create in and out an outfit

that looks just like it

all right great all right that's all ok

I also if we're out and about shopping

uh ask around to see if there's anyone

who can make me some sick Armour like

that magic armor that I had I assume no

one can but evil UNS really interested

in that

if you describe it as being magical

there's nobody here who can really help

you but you do hear rumors that the the

king is sort of the custodian of a vault

rumored to contain dwarven masterworks

of a sort that could include magic suits

of armor I'll just ask him then thanks

so much yeah the magic stabs and there's

at least one dwarf who says that he can

make magic armor but you really

he can know he's thinking more like

magical and figurative sense yeah that's

what works for people yeah I mean we're

all magical in our own way I suppose

well you're doing this tricks is also

gonna try and sell some yak horns that

she found oh okay yeah are we on a full

shopping trip because there's plenty of

things yeah you can dispense with the

Yak horns and somebody here will pay 10

gold pieces eh yeah corn sweet awesome

do I find anyone that I think might be

good at reassembling a robot son I'm

glad you asked oh no oh no why so as you

do a little bit of research and ask

around

there is a dwarf who in his heyday was a

master engineer and he devised many of

the traps a defence Citadel ad bar

against unwanted incursions uh when he

got too old and his eyesight started to

fail him he retired but continued to

basically make toys for dwarven children

and they believed that the the nature of

what you want to sort of find

Mastercraft tinkerer level work is

probably something that he could tackle

I go see him by myself

I don't bring well unless anyone wants

to go with me but I don't like make a

big deal out of it I don't tell paulten

that that's what I'm trying to do okay

because I'm worried that if it fails

I'll just guess it get his little hopes

up all right

and his name is Hiram flame Bain mr.

flame Bain I've come on the

recommendation of so many yep who tell

me you might be able to reassemble this

and I plopped down a bag of Sagman yeah

so I get back I sound like a bag white

coins I collected all the pieces they're

all

here are you are you doing this alone

evylyn on your own uh without notifying

paulten or yeah okay yeah I don't want

to get a little upset okay you by the

way you were led to Thai room in his

workshop by his one of his daughters he

has two daughters who help him

essentially and but they leave you alone

with him and he kind of uh takes his

finger and sort of peeks inside the bag

and and reaches in and pulls out a

handful of simon parts and many of them

are crushed and um just flat disks

basically I I tried to grab like a piece

of paper or something to kind of like

sketch what what he looked like

uh I have no idea if evylyn is a good

artist or not so maybe it even like you

know maybe the sketch is like he had a

head and then he had like a little body

we have little legs like this and

sometimes he threw darts out of it you

know uh I mean can I roll for my

artistic ability on this uh yeah you

could make a performance jackets oh my

god charisma yeah uh twenty okay it's

not about artists yeah you do out you do

actually a fairly decent rendering of

Simon for him and he he takes it he

holds it up really really close to his

face and then he just sort of mumbles

something what what was that and you

sort of lean in uh-huh and he says I am

eglish ru Yan you can make our Simon for

us that's great uh yeah that's that's

wonderful thank you how long do you

think it'll take an NPI by seven vintage

about seven seven to ten days I think

you said okay that's that's great do you

know about your prize that you'd want to

ask

uh sigh Manahan I mean this I made

uncommon no you want to do it for free

that's so kind of you you're the best

what happened I heard a racial slur in

there uh I know you wouldn't you

wouldn't be saying a thousand gold I

think I just misheard you at I'm sure

that's not what you meant cuz I'm sure

you'd want it I'm persuading him

Hardison you don't want to try just a

little less than a thousand something

more reasonable I roll a 24 mm he looks

at the parts again he sort of takes out

a few handfuls looks at the flattened

Springs and the twisted pieces and

eyeball a seizure of crushed partially

crushed course I'm right and he's like

500 sounds more reasonable I mean he is

our son after all and we do love him he

sort of looks at you physically when you

say that but um I I don't have that on

me so I'm gonna take Simon with me and

I'll be back as soon as we can find that

500 gold I'm sure we just have it lying

around somewhere I just don't have it on

me right this second Thanks hey hey yeah

I should take the parts yeah one of the

chat just said girl you got money for

Gucci er but not your own son I'll be

back Thank You mr. flame Bain you have

been the most charming gentleman and I

shall see you very very soon

car a I oh all right so you take your

pile of Simon bets and you head out yes

in the in the plaza where a lot of the

markets and things are there is sort of

a dais in the center where

things are often put on display the last

time you hear there was an ogre chained

up he's still here but he's unconscious

and lying on the floor that's kind of

sad

I got about him he's got some big welts

on his head in his body where he's

peppered with stones and things to amuse

the locals but right now he's either

sleeping or unconscious from the

beatings he's taken you can't tell any

kind of smells but um evylyn is bothered

by this but continues on her way okay um

even as you make your way through the

plaza make a perception check for me

coughs tricks you can roll too since oh

boy you're in the area I like this is so

lower based that it's hilarious that the

dice agree so much because even is just

count like if she's going from place to

place she's just like looking up at the

sky and singing some him to laugh and

her and she's just you know like oh

great morning Lord yet your riches are

so vast and she's just like she's so she

rolls a four ha ha ha I got a seven ok

nothing nothing to see here now Strix is

probably just like crying somewhere I

don't know too many tears to say

anything like oh go ahead all right I'm

just gonna say if you have any other

business let me know otherwise we'll cut

to hard-ass throne hall I do have I do

have that diamond you do have a diamond

yeah so I don't know if evil and has

told me about the whole Simon problem

but yeah I will when I get well I was

assuming we end up back in that like

birth room no y'all have time alone yeah

all right and I will wait yeah so once I

get back I the bag in and I'll say good

news I found this wonderful gentleman

mr. flame Bane and he says that he can

fix Simon up real nice and it's just

gonna cost 500 gold which I'm sure the

King will loan us it'll be no problem at

all I have that you have 500 gold yeah

is it to give

the Simon Rehabilitation box for what

you know takes these backsies strikes is

like pulling out the diamond as soon as

DF is like I have that she's like mm-hmm

[Laughter]

actually like me without giving a lot of

you thinking about do you feel like yeah

I've got that and you'll hand you the

five gemstones he's been carrying that's

worth a hundred GP each that is so kind

of you I knew that you love Simon deep

down in your heart I knew that maybe we

just want you to be quiet about it

oh no it's like it'll get made and no

one will complain anymore and it'll be

fine I don't know why you would ever

want me to be quiet about it

Simon is just the sweetest little boy

that we ever had and I know that

everyone wants to hear about how

wonderful he was don't you think Carlton

I'm just kind of looking at DF bards

never forget I'm just like wait so Diaz

is fully aware that's for his foursomes

hiding behind the white glass oh yeah he

give it as black no hesitation no

resistance or anything just like yes

ticket

I think DF is just really sad strikes

full yell out loud staring as everyone

kind of like goes about their business

in the room I like you know set Simon

aside and put the stones away and I kind

of sit next to Dee asked by the fire and

I'm kind of like do you want to talk

about what happened at the mountain

doesn't discuss I got burned in her

hurts just glad roll back I mean none of

us really know what went on in there and

it seems to be really bothering you and

sometimes it can help to let the light

shine in by unburdening yourself from

the things that that bind you

we have a meeting to get sir all right

I guess he's found them guys let's go

trixl mosey up to evil and be like maybe

whinny you talk to people you shouldn't

mention Lysander like seven times I

didn't mention Lysander at all I was

trying so hard you didn't even hear me

say okay I'm right and I'm alive today

good enough but whiter the same thing

I'm glad you know that now I'm gonna

walk up to DF I'm just gonna like look

them down like you're sure about that in

response to the beating thing no in

response I'm still on the Simon thing

okay did de not give enough I can give a

little bit more if you need it I just I

put my hand on her shoulder just like he

has two dads now welcome to the family

oh yes it's not amused silent monologue

is I made a terrible he was like oh

alright uh I need to roleplay like going

back to flame Boehner could I like stand

a dwarven messenger with the that we

only trust totally can do that okay I

send the the money and the parts with

the Dwarven messenger that we trust to

go give it to flame Beynon he said he

told he told me how long it would take

how long 10 weeks so you say yeah he

said 7 to 10 days

7 to 10 days right ok so at the end of a

10 day you should have your your little

friend back yay or at least we'd have

his body remain right you don't know

about his soul yeah I'm just setting him

up to be taken away again in there okay

he did not have a soul all right for

dwarven guards escort you to the King's

chambers you have to sort of cross

through Citadel ad bar

one point you guys are walking along a

elevated arcade which is open on one

side they're sort of like these pillared

openings looking down into a

thoroughfare within the Citadel where

there's a lot of dwarves bustling back

and forth and other activity as well and

I just like everybody to make a

perception check to see if you notice

anything on your way to okay I got a

nineteen that's good

oh I integrate he sees everything

I'm so aware okay and evil in you rolled

a six okay it's such connection is I did

okay um Halton yes at one point you see

moving among the dwarves and and sort of

obvious Notley obviously not a dwarf

setting much taller than them you see a

slender woman um human possibly

half-elven hey she's got a we haven't

got involved now much lately

[Laughter]

she wears sort of this fabric headdress

and what looks like a crown of some kind

a tall spy inspired crown and as she

moves through the crowd the thing that

you notice about her right away

if she's got a loot over her back

musical instrument and you know she's

sort of bumping into people as she's

making her way but she seems very very

friendly and apologizes to the dwarves

in with kirt little dwarven phrases so

she obviously knows the language and is

comfortable around dwarves and is just

generally kind of moving through but you

because your perception is so high I'm

gonna say that even from this distance

some forty or fifty feet away you sense

some urgency with her like she's she's

moving with a purpose and there's a

sense that she does have some where she

needs to get to quickly or get away from

quickly you can't tell

okay you are struck by her beauty

nothing else hey hey

uh do we know like we're in the party I

am like wow we're grouped up right now I

assume that you're probably at the back

okay um so we're being escorted though

uh yes so if I were to like veer off it

would not it would not be it would not

go unnoticed

probably not unnoticed but you're not

sure the escort would do anything I'm

they probably eating with the king

that there are four of them and for what

you think might happen is one of them

would stay with you it's like each of

you has a little bodyguard slash escort

okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna like

try and necessarily sneak off but like

I'm like walking in the back I love them

just like huh I just kind of like neural

direction okay at one point you can see

there's sort of stairs off the arcade

going down you could probably ear off

and take those if you wanted to okay

you're on a level higher than she is and

as you do that dwarf doesn't say

anything to you just follows you and we

see and believe yes there he goes I'm

sort of see a veer off Strix

now Strix and um dia I don't see her but

they do see um a gathering of what looks

like morning Lord worshippers Strix does

nothing she in fact she points the other

direction is like look over there

there's some Dworkin architecture yeah

you see some you see what appear to be

four humans

rest in stained white robes like they've

obviously come from some distance away

they sort of have the look of pilgrims

or something they clearly don't belong

it's at a lab bar and are clearly

visiting but they've allowed sort of

sucked and the dirt and long travels to

kind of stain their white robes but

there's their white robes was kind of

gold embroidery

of a Sun symbol a Rising Sun on their

backs or on their chests and they are

sort of clustered around each other two

of them you can see clearly are both

women the ones who have their backs to

you look more like a large man and a

small man there's four of them and I

don't see this right you do not see this

she's like our conviction I'm like oh

yeah that is for strikes keeps like

looking back they probably see her like

making a crazy face too but actually one

of them one of them Oh a woman who seems

to be a middle-aged woman and kind of

heavyset will look up and see this gang

of you being escorted on this higher

level of the arcade and she is sort of

struck by the fact that one of you looks

odd um

you that being used tricks must kind of

give you a evil eye stare as you make

your way up like she's not quite sure

what to think but at same time instantly

distrusting Oh God

because evylyn is so short she can't see

fully hype hidden by your big robe and

your crazy face and the angle the angle

looking up she doesn't see short little

evylyn at all she only sees strict CDF

and for a moment paltin before he gears

off and you can see she only looks at

you for a briefest of instance because

she starts looking around the cloud as

crowd as though looking for a missing

member it's me and unless you wish to

draw attention to it you can march on

well Strix kind of feels bad evil has

been a helpful person she'll like tug on

her robe and be like you know how many

times have I died your friends are down

there my friends are right here Strix

and I like take her little face and

pattered cheeks but then I see what

she's pointing out and I said hello

but the lack of the morning load and I

can run up to them stir call so like one

gave me a mean look please tell them not

is that I instantly turn to them and say

brothers and sisters in the might of the

Lord and Lord you're gonna fly down to

them and control as soon as I like I

turned to go down to them she said that

they were mean to her so I was I was

like bright evil and face running down

to them but as soon as she said that

then I'm like yeah going down more

solemnly like approaching you know more

calmly and with like regal air but I

okay your bodyguard follows you

bodyguard you have at night or even

bunny guy Mormon bodyguard Paul so I I

go down tonight I do a bow and kind of a

symbol of the morning Lord's blessing

and I said brothers and sisters so what

brings you to this castle this Citadel

they sort of look you up and down and

they see your iconography or your

symbology the your presence seems to

convey exactly what you are before them

when you see them up close you can see

that they're symbols a bear resemblance

to that of levander but they're not

quite the same uh you saw the last time

you saw a symbol so archaic in

representation was back in burrow why he

actually hears from well one of the

figures who had his back to you

previously turns to you and under the

hood of the robe which he casts back at

this point you see he is an old man with

white wispy hair and a cane and he's got

red tinted spectacles perched on the

bridge of his nose you recognize him as

dr. Rudolf van ricktum the vampire

ideas it's trickling back for everyone

screaming and reading a perfect thing

back here that's a boat whenever doing

that by a diesel just kind of like takes

a step back like Kirstie's and it's kind

of like for the first time ever

speechless

strikes are shaking the dwarf bodyguard

with okay and that's where we'll stop

for tonight what we're at that time well

hey it's really cool and with this being

the dice camera action subreddit which

thanks to this the waffle fam if you

will like the waffle community the

people who tune in and watch and do fan

art and are on the subreddit and it

makes it so fun for us to play when you

guys treat our characters as real as we

treat them and it's really cool to have

even become like a real entity that is

not just owned by me it's owned by all

of you guys too and it feels amazing

when you guys care about what we're

doing because like I think all of us

have said this is a bright spot in our

week and the fact that you guys like to

share that with us makes it so so

meaningful and so valuable and such a

really cool thing in our lives so thank

a stream like this it's definitely

something very special but I don't take
