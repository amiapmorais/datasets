buddy and welcome to dice camera action

I'm Chris Perkins the DM and these are

my wonderful players and whom I love and

I cherish you guys didn't hear it but

literally seconds live Nate just grabbed

his microphone this wins you're not

gonna die you're talking crazy but he

says that every week so organ previously

in The Adventures of the waffle crew

after experiencing the horrible dream

coils of denned are the night serpent to

the waffle crew was confronted with the

reality that a Hal ruined force bomb in

their possession was about to detonate

so strix in a panic threw it through a

dimensional portal and it disappeared

for a time causing further panic at

which point palton used to style palton

used a spell to compel DF to summon

zamesca the Marauder to solve all of

life's problems for them and that didn't

that went about as well as could be

expected under the circumstances DF was

banished from this world to signal

briefly and talked his way back in

before the bomb was about to go off and

as the party raced to retrieve the bomb

DF was the first to arrive inserted one

of his mysterious keys into the device

and shut it down moments before hit

exploded taking the waffle crew and the

city of omen

then there was a bit of a falling out

between

palton and DF as the F confronted paltin

about his spell-casting and about the

the calling forth of sure Mashka at

which point palton didn't storm off but

headed off darkly and then DF feeling

dreadful

the end of the encounter called out Paul

toons name and D F recalls in that

moment from his nightmare reality with

den dar a brief encounter with a version

of paltin he had never seen before a

version of paltin and water deep where

there's snow on the ground falling up

and death walking away and paltin saying

ADF where are you going

aren't we friends anymore and that's

where we start

DF Strix Miranda and evylyn are all in

the tumbledown ruined heart of an old

omen Palace surrounded by toppled

statues ivy-covered columns and

collapsed walls that sort of form a ring

around you and

palton has stormed off and disappear

portal and disappeared and you don't

know where he went since night is

falling over the city things are getting

dark and grim and the city's coming

alive with the sound of insects and

other nocturnal beasts what do the four

of you do in pathans absence do you want

us to talk about how our little 10 now

let's do that first so you've all you've

all grown from this experience and well

well most of you are still suffering

from the effects of the death curse you

did go up to level 10 which means your

characters changed somehow let's fill

the waffle family in on what happened to

you guys

starting with death sure

I actually got a decent hit point role

for once I felt good oh boy yeah so

level 10 for rogues is typically an

ability score increase but there's

always the option we're observing the

Billy score increase you can take a feat

which is what I opted to do I probably

won't reveal the actual feat yet because

I think that'll be a neat little

surprise whenever that happens well I

did talk to Chris about it and got the

OK

so aside from that the liner thing you

need to know is that I got more hit

points and that my wisdom score has

increased to 15 very good very good

which why did the wisdom score increase

what's the lore this part of the tree so

weird

oh he's grown well I mean the obvious

answer is I just went for the ability

score I want to put it into wisdom I

mean at this point the F has become so

attuned for being the census for the

entire party mm-hmm

you would have gotten plus to that

button say you got plus one plus another

bonus from the feet instead very little

I got HP which I rolled horribly as

usual but my con modifiers high so

that's good and then I got a or of

courage which means that anyone within

10 feet of me cannot be frightened if

I'm conscious so I make you all feel

real safe what you know what seems like

a really good time to have that yeah but

it's also true yeah aw shucks all right

Holly yeah I took a bunch of dumb stuff

that I don't need but it's fun that's

the most important thing yeah I got some

hit points this is a really huge level

for sorcerer's too much except for the

fact that I get another meta magic

mm-hmm I changed all my meta magic too

quick and spell careful spell and twin

spell so I can now cast two polymorphs

at once if I want to or but I can't cast

any AoE

things at once cuz of that would be

ridiculous would be busted there is no

double fire will happen no but there is

a couple of things that I did to boost

the party so I kind of focused a little

bit more on things that would buff the

party a little bit instead of just

explode things so you guys will see that

if it comes up but and Nate what did

paltin get it for goody

oh you know some stuff pretty got some

epsom HP got some guts and spells got

some oh I'm more inspiring which is

grace yes you know like you'll ever do

it for us I mean we'll see we will

indeed okay and so with that in mind

night falling over omou unrest in the

party what does the bulk of the party do

after paltin zaps away evylyn is just

kind of standing there staring at the

place where he was when he dimension

door and kind of just like stunned and

zoned out be clear he took Simon with

him so Strix is immediately going to fly

up in the air and start looking for him

okay and there's I don't I can't imagine

like I already looked around I can't

imagine I see him at all if you use the

dimension door he probably is apt well

outside of your range of vision probably

passed several rings of palace walls

right so your vision would be limited by

that if nothing else when Strix hops on

her staff and turns it into a broom

there's an explosion of smoke out from

underneath her like a rocket as she

shoots up into the air why does it not

work well and it makes a backfiring

noise it you go up into the night sky

and begin to look around what are the

rest of you doing after Strix disappears

by disappears that means leaves up into

the darkness Marianas just gonna sit

next to that the body of her friend just

has the veg of baby he just sits there

okay

that's right you've got a dead you want

he of short stature which Ana

evylyn you recall hacked it to pieces

swifter axe last week it was it was in

need of some slashing yeah even I think

is just you know how when you're stunned

by something you feel like maybe if you

don't move it didn't actually happen cuz

you're not letting time continue I think

she's kind of in that mode right

slow blinking yeah exactly okay sorry I

think death is mostly just kind of

waiting to see if Strix sees anything

and if if she's able to reach him or get

after or whatever but he's he's at a

point like Reber pulpwood

went there's no way ideas can catch up

to him or help him he's like kind of

resigned to being stuck here and yeah

awkwardly standing there like shuffling

I mean not really like awkward shuffling

but more like uh you know when like you

just see something really really bad

happen and you get like that nervous

energy and you're not really sure what

to do with your hands or look around or

who to talk to

so he's just kind of like you still

processing it doesn't have no idea

what's happening or what to do okay

Holly is you dart up into the night sky

you do have dark vision so that helps

but one of the things you notice about

or one things you recall about Elmo is

it's sort of overgrown with lots of

buildings and things and then lots of

vines weeds and trees grasping on to the

stone and lots and lots of cover so make

a perception check but roll two dice and

take the lower result of course all

right that's a six ok so you Zipporah

yelling I'm going okay so you're you're

whacking your broom and cursing up a

storm there as you do yelling for Paul's

name calling out his name yeah you're

making everyone sad

[Laughter]

about various corners of our city yeah

there's like snakes like yes and as you

begin to so are you just kind of going

off into a direction are you gonna kind

of do rings or like yeah I just imagine

are just like doing little like circles

okay yep and then like checking back on

the party and seeing like no one has

moved and she's like oh just like going

back and just like yeah yeah Oh mo is

very much a city of the Dead and it

other than insects and things you don't

hear much activity below you you do hear

your voice coming back at you as it

echoes down into the chasm and back you

can hear the distant rush of the

waterfall that floods part of the city

with the river off to the south there is

light spilling up from a lava fissure in

the bottom end of the city that cracked

open sometime in the distant past so you

do see sort of a hellish light coming up

off of there as well as steam from where

the river pours in but as you look

around with your roll you see no sign of

paltin whatsoever and you think it's

going to be extremely hard to find him

at night if he doesn't want to be found

and you're not seeing any magical

effects go off or anything to suggest oh

there is I have wine no I don't have

wine I'll just guess I'll just go back

to the party there okay so about like 30

minutes later Strix comes back you hear

her come you hear the back fire first

and then you see here descend down on

her broom and yeah turn it I guess into

us I'm gonna find him

that's all right you tried I did try

I'm sorry everyone

I didn't I didn't mean for that to

happen I didn't when he says he's sorry

evylyn just kind of like slow turns like

she's coming out of a daze and looks at

him kind of blinks shakes her head and

she's it's it's not your fault he this

was bound to happen at some point and he

shouldn't he shouldn't have done what he

did either so don't don't be too hard on

yourself he wasn't bound to stay with us

very long anyway well I'm sure it wasn't

like he was attached to anyone or

anything he was just here for the ride

so I guess it wasn't fun anymore Strix

just jumps on her broom again goes up in

this in the air and goes you're making

evil and sad all right so Strix is gone

again and again screaming over the dead

city uh I will say I'm not I'm not sure

how much of it I'm hoping that at least

some of it is the ring but I know it has

have had a good effect on him in the

long run

he seems normal to me I'm sure he does

I'm hoping that it's just the ring uh

it's uh well my people made it and they

made a mistake in making it and it got

corrupted and it's sort of houses an

evil entity an entity yeah when you say

sort of houses you mean like toys don't

knows house I don't really know I

haven't gotten to really look at it yet

since he was wearing it I just know that

it's not good there's a reason my people

tried to get rid of it yeah and you guys

you recall

evylyn artists when he was with the

party saying to paltin that he didn't

think paltin should have the ring

because he feared the ring would take

control of him yeah but she thought it

was fine as Miranda talking even just

kind of like drifts and she ends up like

kind of Leaning like grabbing her around

the waist and leaning on her just kind

of like obviously unconscious of the

fact that she's taking comfort wherever

she can get it Miranda kind of seems

like a like a mom comforter type person

so when you do that a like the little

vegetabie sort of crawls up between you

suddenly there's this sort of vegetable

matter stuffed between you and Miranda

okay arms around Miranda no I want to

put my arms around evil into okay I want

to comfort her okay even almost when the

vegie pygmies like this is my mom it was

almost like oh sorry but then and she

just kind of sits there like all right

Haleh you come back having seen no sign

of paltin I was like in like the

rescuers where there was a swamp machine

yeah you probably had your own little

adventure in the night where you were

handed by a pair of fiendish

pterodactyls who wanted to take a bite

out of you know evil it's sad right

she's a robot it's sad yeah

and once they once you realize that

you've escaped them but you're no longer

over home what do you quickly fly back

yeah I just I'd like to just crash into

the ground okay

and slide as far as it will take me okay

the broom just sort of sticks into the

ground and strick stumbled well and I

just stuck I just don't move I just

landed she just thought are you hurt oh

no she's like coming ups like all right

now that's how she always lands you've

got a couple new grass stains now

at all Amanda Miranda I can only hope

you're right and then it is the ring but

something tells me something tells me

this has been brewing long before that I

don't know your history as well as

obviously you guys do but just don't

give up on him so easily

I listen I know I haven't it's just he's

he's always hated me and I know that I

want what's best for him it's like he

doesn't hate you

yes he does everything he isn't he

doesn't hate you know you ain't see him

you didn't see his eyes when Simon was

what first Simon was crushed you didn't

see what I saw that was hate just don't

give up on him yet I haven't it's just

you have no idea how important friends

are until you lose and every single one

of them when she says that strikes like

sniffles into her own carcass over there

and some weeds still sitting there some

flies have taken to it but nobody else

seems to pay much mind at this point Oh

No so shuffle back up and belay up we

got a debtor over here and just start

digging and digging a hole what are you

using to dig the hole my pie pan okay so

you turn your staff into a pie pan and

begin digging with the frying pan

oh yeah and it's probably pretty soft

cuz it's like jungle yeah well about a

foot you hit what appeared to be buried

cobblestones

like this was once a cobble covered

courtyard that just become overgrown

with leaf matter and dead vegetable

matter and stuff so you actually do hit

pretty solid ground you'd have to start

prying up the cobble bricks everyone she

goes does anyone mind if I chop the

debtor up or do you want them all in the

hole

that's okay you can cut him up

it wasn't started with the she she sees

Strix working and she's just sitting

there like leaning on Miranda so she's

like oh and she comes over and just kind

of like in a daze is just helping pull

up rocks okay while you're doing that um

you're not terribly bothered by insects

here and that's because once it really

starts to get dark coming out of God

knows where maybe caves and the walls of

omou are thousands upon thousands of

bats the major start circling circling

overhead and feeding on all of the

insects over the palace until there's

this black swirling vortex of flapping

wings above you it would be chilling

except they're actually probably doing

you a favor and they don't killing they

don't seem to bother you there they're

high enough up like maybe a hundred

fifty to a hundred feet up somewhere in

there and just I have insect repellent

in case the bugs get too bad so prepared

I'd hear their little squeaks and

shrieks and all that business it's

actually at that time that Calton almost

became about we don't talk about that

time that was the bad time I remember

what about those of you with burrow via

stress syndrome know that you know

thousands of bats are not a good not

necessarily a healthy thing but they -

just remember times with our friends

once they're gone you pull up enough

rocks and things to create a hole big

enough to drop this halflings lizard

body in it chop chop and chop his body

he would have liked it this way no you

throw it you throw the pieces of Typho

into the hole and cover him up Oh Evelyn

wants to stand up and like brush off her

robes and like hold Miranda's hand like

would you like to say a few words would

you like me to say

would you yeah I don't know what to say

purchases like just watch it was like

I'm dying that's what Sanders job and

she just like goes in sitting next to a

tree just like stairs

oh great heavenly morning Lord who

watches over all of us in life and in

death blessed be your servant what was

his name

hi Typho blessed be your servant Typho

who today has made the journey from the

darkness to a new dawn may he find what

does he want to find peace may he find

peace and what else light and and light

as we all search for the light in our

own hearts may he find the ultimate

light in your presence a holy morning

Lord hallelujah amen

type o spirits in the soul moment right

now bring back all right

just to gloss over the night what what

do you guys want to do you're gonna make

camp yes I think we have to normally we

have a hut to stay in I can pull another

gloom in court I can make us a nice

little bubble they haven't seen this

Miranda this particular group so what

happens when you conjure forth your

gloaming court a bubble sort of forms in

the ground it's a 30-foot bubble and it

looks like a soap bubble it's got that

shining shimmering little surface area

but when someone steps inside like as

soon as Miranda steps inside it's sort

of like absorbs her like a membrane and

you can't see her inside well at least

it's harder to see inside so you can we

see on the through can we see the

outside in while we're in it mmm it

gives you a +5 for stealth and

perception okay but we can like enter in

and out as much as we please

okay dirty bubble and she's sort of like

yeah where they go inside the the

vegetation seems more lush here the

smells are sweeter there might even be a

couple little fireflies zipping around

inside I'm not very tired so I'm gonna

take the first watch outside if you guys

don't mind notes

sorry I'll take watch I I'm not tired

[Laughter]

all right mister stomps outside actually

maybe you're right evylyn if he does

come back don't think I'll be the first

thing he wants to see in Deus we'll

enter with the membrane all right so

he's camped out in the little miniature

gloaming court Evelyn are you gonna let

Strix take first watch

as she insists I mean she's already

doing it so you know just kind of like

she's planted her staff that's who

doesn't seem to have her usual amount of

willpower right now so she just kind of

shrugs and shoulders into the gloaming

court but uncharacteristically usually

whenever she goes to bed she just finds

like the nearest nicest person and like

snuggles up to them and goes to sleep

but this time she just kind of finds a

little corner and curls up and tries to

sleep but just sits there staring cool

yeah you don't have a waffle pillow

either to lie on that's right right well

the night passes uneventful II just the

set this is the fluttering of bats

overhead having their nightly feast by

morning they have all but dispersed its

Strix did you intend to wake anybody up

or did you want to try to ride out the

whole night I will write out the whole

night okay then you do and as the

earliest bits of morning light begin to

shine upon the jungle canopy

high atop the cliff walls overlooking

the palace you realize now might be a

good time to wake everybody all right

and it's a it's at that time Strix when

you see Halton oh he has returned I

don't say anything because I don't want

to wait big so I'm just like he's so

yeah it looks like he's he's just sort

of walked back into the center of the

palace Oh does he see yes or no yeah

it's pretty hard not to see you and the

bubble okay I as soon as I see him I

would like to just misty step in front

of him all right Bolton Strix suddenly

evaporates at some distance away and

what peers right before you hello

you care to explain yourself or Bolden's

not even like it's beyond ignoring

sounds like he'd he doesn't even like

act like anyone's even there so he just

does a sort of graceful sidestep it

slips past her oh oh okay oh not okay

yeah as he as he just sort of whoop past

you you're like oh like holding on North

staff really hard she's like do you know

how much you hurt you hurt them

by leaving why did you leave evil ones

just might as well be dead inside I mean

she's a robot I don't know if she's dead

inside maybe she's not I'm just saying

I'm just saying

and she's like Souls Missy step in front

of him again she appears in front of you

again talk to me still just looking

right through her just like looking

outwards like away from everyone my

pendant by this time Strix is cries of

look at me have alerted the rest of the

party who stir from their slumber or in

trance or in Miranda's case ears is sort

of roused from your trance as soon as

evylyn here's Paul tunes voice she goes

look right outside the bubble like yeah

I'm just flying and fluttering she

doesn't even go like toward him she just

goes out to see what's happening right

if they D like kind of starts his sprint

to head towards them but then

immediately second-guesses it and just

stops himself and just stands like

within the bubble and just watches yeah

and just observes from the inside out um

is there anything around me like

statuary wise there's tons of toppled

statues partially toppled so in cases of

cases just the base of the statue and

you don't know where the top of it went

other cases you see the head of the

statue or something yeah there's all

kinds of statute parts around here

okay anything that looks like it could

grapple someone mm yeah you think

there's like a torso with like parts of

arms that if you were to pin use it to

pin somebody down you could do that some

of the statues here were clearly of

ceremonially dressed humans others

appear to have been minotaurs oh so

there's like a Minotaur head which has

like two horns that could be used to

like hold somebody down if they were

pinned underneath it okay yeah I would

as he walks past me again completely

ignoring me I would like to cast a twin

spell animate object Oh

print statues one with the horns and

that looks like it might be able to

grapple oh okay groovy and that's right

that's as I see the party coming and I'm

just like very angry all right so to

statute two pieces of statues seem to

come alive and are you actually going to

try to use them to grapple paltin I am

okay then so and I'd like one of them to

cover his mouth that will that will be

difficult

okay well but you can have them make

strength checks so these are these are

basically medium sized right is that

we're doing two medium sized ones yeah

okay then make a d20 roll and and two to

each of those rolls make to D 20 rolls

one finish piece did we see Simon was

palton no okay so one is 12 oh wow the

other is 21 okay

and palton make a either a strength or

dexterity make a strength athletics or

dexterity acrobatics check okay

acrobatics is 24 and once more you've

easily evaded one of them uh 26 and you

easily evade the other facts yeah I

might have that might have been what I

did at level 10 yeah so strict seers

statues sort of grapple at him but he's

just like pulling himself away very

artfully and they don't even lay a hand

on him

is uh am i aware of this bubble you can

see the bubble and in fact you were in

the bubbles previously so you know

you're aware of its effect that is

floating just outside it yeah

you suspect Miranda must be inside the

bubble because she created it okay you

know what I and I wouldn't be would I be

able to penetrate the bubble or is it

just Miranda what's the story on that is

there anything keeping him out or

hemming him out I I don't think so we

just have a plus five to stealth inside

the bubble and a plus five to perception

yeah so we'd be I think harder to see

yes we're are harder to see but yeah

there's nothing actually I'm looking at

it now there's nothing to prevent you

from going inside but I don't I I so I

only see evil and strix so to see

anything inside the bubble you oh I

thought they had both left both strix

both strix and evil in our outside you

can see them perfectly clearly but if

you want to see something inside the

bubble you'll have to make a perception

check okay

I would like to yeah I'd like to see if

I can see in the bubble okay we're on

that Miranda and deaaath are you taking

any efforts to conceal yourselves in the

bubble because if you do you get a +5

bonus on your stealth check to hide from

paltin gif really isn't he's just

standing there

so make your role Miranda and make a

perception check palton to see if you

see her in the bubble and remember

Miranda you have a +5 bonus to your

scope and that's it for okay okay so you

don't see Miranda but you can see the

shape basically of DF he's sort of

shadowy within the bubble but he's

standing close enough to the edge of it

that there's nothing really obscuring

him you see his dark form okay and I'm

I'm certain that's him based on his

profile and you know is his silhouette

you're pretty darn sure it's him

all right so paulten just kind of gets

up no words that is just dead eyeing a

DF everybody sees that so guess what

that like deaath obviously knows like

weird palsy is staring and understand

what's happening so death will step

forward and reveal himself okay I'm the

bubble just so yep just stands out and

just

and the statutes try to grab them again

yes they are still under your control if

you want to make another attempt well at

but if holding you have an action let's

roll initiative and we'll resolve that

anybody who doesn't want to jump into

this fray doesn't have to roll

initiative but it sounds like Strix and

paltin at the very least you need to it

sounds like no one should jump into the

fray what are you talking about well the

statutes are attacking Paul not hacking

but grappling paltin are trying to so

let's roll anybody who wants to roll a

die or initiative Eaglin is sure that

her family is fine and all loves each

other and she doesn't want a roll

initiative at all understood palton what

was your initiative 1414 Holly what was

tricks is initiative eighteen and

anybody else nine nine okay ten four

Miranda so Strix your statues come over

make your 2d 20 rolls and add two to the

results of each and ten and 17 okay and

paulten to avoid being grappled by it

make to dexterity acrobatics checks you

have to need a 10 on the first one and a

17 on the second first one is 15 okay

you're good there second one is 18 okay

you are not graphic again you just

they're not trying to hurt him that's

clear they are just trying to hold him

back yeah okay you sense that paltin

they're not attacking you or harming you

but they are becoming a bit of a

nuisance what would you like to do since

it's now your turn so paltin staring at

DF mmm-hmm just no words just dead

eyeing still mm-hmm

takes out the hill of the Sun sword

mm-hmm and then just starts straight for

DF alright how far is he from me oh he's

probably like about 30

okay so Paul in his dead sprinting yeah

I can get I can get to him from there

mm-hmm he's running up he's about to

take his swing yep and then he's gone he

disappears so during all this as Mike

Alton's even running so my guy felt it

was even running yet DF just made no

move to fight back or dodge or anything

yeah you saw it you saw this Sun glowing

blade coming at you and then just before

it's ready to strike you it it and its

wielder just gone yeah but like as soon

as he's gone DF is Amelie just like

really like looking around like that has

happened

he was like gathering herself because as

soon as he disappeared she just laid out

like a doll you know just sitting up

looking around like her little robot

brain is just all a word she can't

figure out what's going on so then right

as he disappears right after D it is a

little as this flustered moment palton

becomes uninviting DF you just feel the

hilt of the Sun sort right up against

your back like ignite it or just go just

right now alright so like pressing it in

but with the blade off right okay yeah

so paltin reappears behind DF like an

invisibility spell just dropped away

from him and DF you feel that hilt up

against your spine and then he leans in

really close and just whispers in his

ear

now we're even puts the hilt away and is

now cracking up hilariously you

should've seen your face that was so

good

oh my god that was amazing okay good now

right good do you let a be the a 40th

like just like falls down to like his

knees in a hand just like sweat just

dripping off of them and then after like

Paulding kind of starts laughing DF

actually starts laughing to almost like

he doesn't even really understand her no

lie and then like rolls over onto his

back and just laying it out in the

ground just laughing with Moulton oh we

have fun here even like tries to start

laughing with them do you see that

actually like she can't cry but you know

there's there's that the the holy oil

that kind of courses through her whole

body it just starts to leak like it's

just like dribbling down as she's kind

of like strix is a cloud she just floats

away she was gonna care anymore she just

hope she dies okay yeah she floats away

she could just hear paltin and yet

laughing outside of the gloaming

hemisphere miranda you're inside you're

like doesn't understand jokes

I guess we're all just sitting here

laughs daddy at this point D is gone

diesel like kind of sit up scrutinies

forwards and just kind of bring his arms

like up onto his knees yeah paulten

extends a hand to help him up and be

like come on man I thought we were

friends

the FDF will take his arm and then like

you know use that to support himself up

and enter does it he'll say we are

friends which is why I'm I'm sorry I was

harsh to you I understand I understand

why you did it I get it

hey hey hey I'm gonna cut you off right

there I acted hastily kind of blew up

when it came back in my face I get it

I don't do apologies and I don't want

anyone else to do apologies so you know

what water in the bridge we're all here

we're all great what's next

I just I know why you did it none of us

were acting but I just need you to

understand that Diaz will actually hold

up the ramp keys there is a price for

every single one of these and I can't

get I can't let them just go away and

then the last thing that I ever want is

for shemekka

to have any of them these are beyond

last resort it comes at great personal

cost every time I turn one please I can

never do that again okay yeah I I guess

I should have had more background what

so what's the deal with this sh Mishka

thing I mean they seem too powerful

that's all I gathered there's now a

crying cloud next to you okay it's

tricks is here

[Laughter]

dear Phil explained everything about

romesco and everything that she is at

the same time Ryan take inventory about

house romesco is a power for canola from

the plane of signal who knows everything

about everyone and it's been slowly

manipulating df2 doing everything that

she wants and it's super evil I

don't trust it at all but every time I

used to kick it to ask three questions

and I don't know what it means when I

lose all them because I've had these

keys for years from unbeknownst to me a

celestial being who's entrusted it to me

to guard them and I've just been keeps

giving the wind just given the way one

of them is actually stuck in that black

egg which and yeah one of them is

currently still in the egg which I am

NOT going to turn or move yeah was

probably call that we should probably

ask is even taking that back gag bomb

eggs attention gets called back to the

egg bomb even ones like oh oh oh I'm

glad you reminded me of that cuz at dawn

demon D F lost another hit point

from the Z def curse that's fine

I just gained something the level of so

do I still have the the death curse ring

yeah okay yeah so I guess after that

exchange bling-bling

I technically have four keys left one of

them is inside the bomb but so after

that exchange in explaining everything

des will actually then actually go over

to Strix she's still cloud crying

huh next up Alton and then after going

to Strix and she's like I know she's

just on the cloud for so yeah just like

Strix Strix come on I need you right now

turn back into a trash pile alright to

death to death will didn't yield on next

to her honey

and then while she's on the ground des

will say Strix

I need you to listen to me because I

need something from you

oh it's Dori it'll be simple I just I

think we all need this and this is

really really important

alright deaath will take his key ring

remove one of the keys and then like

takes tricks his hand and like place it

into it first she's like she's just like

okay yeah and just he was just like

listen to me I need you to hold on to

this forever I know these things are

powerful I know she much Kawana

something which is why she can't have

them and I need you no matter what do

not let this go never lose it never use

it on anything I need your help with

this and I know you can do this Strix

you've become so strong I'm not you are

look at yourself look at you become look

what you can do and I know you can do

this and I need you to hold on to this

and not let anything happen to it and DF

would take his hand and use it to kind

of curl mistress's fingers up around the

key and to say whatever I don't care

what you do with it or where it goes I

just need you to make sure this stays

safe when you close her hand around the

key and your hands are sort of on top of

hers and the key is contained within you

the rest of you see a pulse go out from

them oops and it's moment it's a it goes

out that first Rix India it just feels

like it doesn't feel like anything it's

like for a moment all the all the air

just sort of kind

went away in a sudden rush but then I

was very fleeting but the rest of you

sort of saw the grass ripple away from

them as this pulse went out did we feel

that no great

you guys were basically you guys were in

the eye and that effect yeah you didn't

feel the things holding the key you got

the ground just like I all right

I'm show us like stick it somewhere in

her robes yeah perfect Britt's lost

forever

she's got the looks on the inside of her

robe probably yeah films like that was

wit was that weird I feel like that was

weird

there's no reason why anyone would have

anything other than for Joe's friendship

friendship

she's just ignoring everyone and then

she'll just like give TF a hug okay

mom's in the back you don't hear that so

I guess then after that that's so scary

yeah but we did that we didn't see that

yeah I know that I know we're just going

to move on he's just crying and for some

reason she like can't stop crying she's

like okay that's how I'm useful

Miranda while this is going on and you

you're at a loss for words to explain a

lot of what's happening between these

people but one of the other vegetabies

who you recognize as parsnip come comes

over to you in the as just as the the

Sun is coming up over the city the walls

around you are still too high to let any

Sun shine upon you but it's soon enough

you'll be feeling the beating Sun but

one of them comes out of the shadows and

just kind of tugs on your outfit he kind

of points off into a

rection where there is a hole in the

wall which you suspect he came through

and he seems to be somewhat distressed

like he's trying to get your attention

and to go somewhere over to the hole

yeah okay well she's doing that and

after DF stands out after giving Strix

the key and turn that the rest of the

party he just kind of like pauses for a

moment and then looks at Paulette and

says where's Simon oh shoot sorry um I

had I had Simon hide for that little

thing for that little little show come

on he was just fine so when like Simon

reappears and like kind of reunites with

Simon Oh

d/f actually gets a little bit of a like

a smile to himself like sort of relief

and a sort of admiration okay Miranda

you sort of crawl through this hole at

the vet you pigmen came out and you can

see that there is another veggie pygmy

waiting on the other side of the hole

looking just as nervous as parsnip and

this one's name is green beans

can I see anything around him

is there anything like beyond 10 that's

obviously distressing memories no it's

just more ruins and wreckage but once

you sort of crawl out through the hole

and you're on this side of the wall they

seem intent to take you somewhere okay

I'm just gonna lean down and shout

through the hall want me to go somewhere

so uh yeah I don't know I don't know

what's wrong with him is it going back

towards the soul monger cuz that's where

we're going if you want company they

seem to be pulling you back kind of the

way you came from near where the the

entrance into

Thane has been uh quite it's sort of off

in that general direction kind of toward

the heart of the city really okay do I

know at all if that's where we had

assumed the soul monger was towards the

heart of the city you honestly have no

idea where the soul monger is in the

city yeah okay yeah you can I'll just I

was gonna say you came here with your

party to find it but you weren't able to

locate it you tried to infiltrate the

the Palace and various other major

buildings looking for clues to where it

might be you even checked out a few

shrines and things but you weren't able

to find it yeah then I'll go back

through the whole it looks like we're

going towards the center of the city I

don't I don't know what it is they want

but they seem really upset so I don't

know if that's the way you're going but

uh was that the way we were going well I

think I'm probably supposed to blow up

that soul monger so she picks up the

bomb also also straights walks up to

evil and it's like people and you seem

sad please don't be sad everyone's back

together she's got this like kind of

innocent hopeful face oh I'm fine

everything's totally normal see that's

not normal I'm smiling everything's fine

let's just you know get our Top Gun a

verb for actual play sake Chris did we

determine that the cylinder was

somewhere within Roz Nietzsche's lair

this was like oh this is like a separate

location you aren't sure you don't know

you you were told that from the Oracle I

believe that Roz nisi was key to young

to getting there but you don't know

specifically where it is in Beretta the

 out of him and you didn't yeah he

did not survive long enough

thanks to six Strix to the spider balls

and Lana and a little bit of help from

Miranda as well he did not get

questioned right and the location of

- foxes spectacles and book was

somewhere not Rasmus - Slayer yes

correct okay so there's a pretty good

chance I need to look elsewhere for that

mm-hmm

now go on

well paltin would like to take notice of

Evelyn's mood and because it's it's

pretty apparent that she's like not a

hundred percent there right yeah I would

say so okay so he picks up on this and

he's gonna walk over to her and just

hands on shoulders like everything's

okay we're all here I'm right where I

need to be right now okay you you are

uh-huh

like here here yes right where you need

to be like like in this particular

meadow or like I'm trying to I'm trying

to try to like to make it kind of

comfort here okay yeah thanks thank you

huh nothing goes I thought watching this

exchange yeah you know you're like you

playing something mad and you're just

like oh this will totally go there's no

reason but it does it's fine she puts

her hands on his shoulders awkwardly so

they both have their awkward hands on

each other's shoulders like a middle

school dance it's like really it's like

so are we like church hugging now

like this like a Lysander thing yeah

yeah hurry back to Miranda and Strix is

just like did we miss anything like all

this is going on DS like back on task

did we miss a you think back in a

rousing you see Slayer was there

anything else that we try to go back and

find maybe we missed maybe some possible

clues or something to find these mr.

Fox's things and this end is so longer

from what I remember there wasn't a

doorway that we hadn't gone through yeah

you didn't there yes you're correct all

right miss tricks that sound right to

you hey I'll try and remember my times

with the affirmation more rich and more

successful adventuring party and more

famous tries to think about how about if

there is anything I remember maybe about

the entrance because I know that they

were looking for - yes you know you know

based on your recollection and I'll have

you make an intelligence check just to

see how much you recall okay you

remember that they had received this

information that there were that the

omens having lost boob tau OOP tau

forsook them or foot had forsaken them

and so they took to worshiping these

nine new gods who showed up to sort of

fill the power vacuum and it turned out

to those they turn to be turned out to

be trickster gods and when the city fell

and the gods died they entombed the gods

under the city in a special tomb which

is called the tomb of the nine gods and

presumably that's where you think you

have to go but you know the entrance is

somewhere in the city and you know that

it may be warded or guarded or locked to

prevent just anybody from getting in but

you're not sure exactly where in the

city that is right but we do need to we

do need to find some of these tricks or

gods because they might be able to help

us right and you see you've seen their

iconography in the city yeah and around

the city although you have

visited much of the city you have seen

things that look like they might be

shrines dedicated to these gods because

they have obelisks with the gods faces

and yeah and I cannot Rafi built into

them but you haven't met the gods

themselves or seen any evidence of their

presence which I guess if they were

buried in a tomb you wouldn't but right

she don't say all that and just say we

need to find these they're like little

powers they're not big powers maybe

they're not even powers maybe there's

something else and she like tries to

explain it gets distracted comes back on

task and it's like we need to find them

right and then DF return back to Miranda

and you're saying that the Brussels

sprout was trying that one he's very

specific I'm sorry that was really a

problem and actually Miranda the person

have sort of is sort of left off away

from you and is running ahead a bit but

stopping to make sure that you're

following and he he looks distressed

um he's he's sort of frustrated that

you're moving so slowly all right

they're headed towards the center of the

city I think so that's where I have to

go they're really upset and um well they

live here so let's follow them right

maybe they found something yes I need

someone to say that this is where we

could possibly find us so longer and mr.

Fox's items is this is where we could

find a self aunt monger and maybe mr.

Fox's items thank you

therefore I can continue on this path

okay um this even has heard absolutely

none of this and it's just put the bomb

down like the second cuz you know had

her hands as soon as she was grabbing

his hand she just kind of like thunk it

to the side it sounds like like in that

moment but also minding the bomb like

yeah you're having this quiet moment

that's this catastrophic device like

very structured awkward quiet I'm gonna

wrap up

Morning Glory from my staff and give

- potato - run run through the crack in

the wall to give to paltin to give to

her oh oh so this little venture picnic

comes with a Morning Glory

and they're sort of nudges you paltin oh

hi oh oh oh okay I'm sorry

that's how lettuce sounds when lettuce

stalks sound of lettuce talk never so

that's being given to me to give to her

or it's been given to you sure you make

an inside check if you want to oh okay

OOP that rolled up that's a 14 wingman

Miranda yeah you're not exactly sure but

you do recall that Evelyn has something

for morning glories you don't you can't

remember what it is exactly here takes

in her eyes go like super wide and like

the little mechanics of them are just

twinkling I knew it it's sign I was

waiting for and then she like spirals up

into the air like one of those spinny

fairy toys that you used to have you

know and then she just goes Morning

Glory the time has come bring the dog

and then she summons morning good and

what does Morning Glory look like in

your mind just dessert cuz we haven't

seen her in a while well assuming

there's no strange changes based on

where we are no there's not okay good

so Morning Glory is

like this beautiful white steed but her

mane and tail are almost you would say

golden like horses can't be gold right

but when you look at it it just looks

like it might be gold and she doesn't

have wings but there's this pattern like

on her shoulders

this just this like you know the the way

that her markings are that look like two

folded wings right on her shoulders and

she's just like the most majestic golden

steed you've ever seen right and you

want to appear on the ground I assume

right here and then her father I got

it's a boom she lands it appears yeah

just as the Sun light of the morning

sort of creaks over the walls of the

ruined palace and shines through in the

spot that Morning Glory appears she just

appears in this beam of morning light

this golden horse with these beautiful

patterns on her shoulder one's like

glowing too and she's so happy that like

maybe there's still a droplet or two of

that oil leaking out you know she's just

like and she kind of takes

morning-glories face and she puts her

forehead to morning-glories forehead and

she she starts whispering some things

but all you make out is like a I'm sorry

this is happening I like the camera to

just pants is sitting on the ground

trying to chew on this key on the ground

in a pile of dirt and like this here

this morning light then this is the

weight this thing like tear it apart and

like writing ruins on it this key is

pretty indestructible you've tried

everything and it's you can't put a dent

in it I don't think I've tried

everything

then Eveland like you know as soon as

she kind of has this moment with morning

glory and says all these things to her

she motions are over and they trot over

to Politan and cheese

morning glories neck and paltin both a

big hug and squeezes them thank you so

much you have been a messenger of the

light this day of Lysander shines upon

us and a new dawn will be on our

friendship and on our family and we

might evil yeah that's right strong

robot she's just gonna start running

after ok parson yeah as you run back

through the ruins of the city and

through other broken wall over other

broken walls and they're leaving you

there leading there in yon but basically

back toward near the entrance the secret

entrance to the fame of the night

serpent but before they get there just

outside of the outermost wall of the

palace there is a cops of trees wild

overgrown jungle trees and as you're

making your way through those trees and

they're leading you through one of them

probably has you by the hand and just

sort of tugging you along as fast as he

can walk you begin to see you begin to

notice one thing right away is it's

colder here then the place you just came

from and it seems to get colder the

deeper you go in and then suddenly as

you break through the trees you can see

that there is a clearing and it is like

a frozen garden of death all of these

frozen veg 'epic Me's just sort of

covered in ice and frost with snow and

ice all around them and there's it's

it's most of the ones you know it's

carrot its turnip its snow-bot Roy snow

there's a there's a there's an albino

one frozen in the ice named snow pea and

they're all just absolutely frozen solid

evylyn tries not to but she looks right

at Paulson's ring

well even that hasn't seen this yet only

Miranda has seen this dang it nevermind

can I Moreno's gonna try and start

breaking through the ice and just

clawing as as hard as she can to get one

of them out yeah you find that it's very

hard to break the ice with your hands

but if they'll crack it with your staff

you can sort of split off chunks of it

and as you do you can see it's like they

were flash frozen like something hit

them so suddenly that they just

instantly died and were frozen solid and

as you pee as you start to peel the

first one opens no PSA you can tell that

the betcha pick me was instantly frozen

to death she just kind of cradles the

body and there's you count like there

must be 30 of them scattered throughout

this garden and it looks like they were

hit by multiple blasts and you can see a

lot of the trees also have this sort of

frozen flash frozen look to them like

they were struck are caught in the blast

of cold as well miss Perkins is like

okay fine you're not gonna die in the

game I'm gonna kill like 50 of the

people you Brandes finally finally

crying there are just these were the

last things that she had all of her

friends are dead and now these guys are

mostly gone too and she's just sobbing

and she looks to and she she goes who

did this parsnip points back toward the

waffle crew of course alright she stands

up with snow pea still and she goes

towards them until she's with in viewing

range of Alton and and she holds it out

what she said did you do this so the

rest of you see as you are following

Miranda you see her come out of these

trees with this frozen veggie pygmy

corpse

and say exactly what she just said I

said strict seasons frozen immediately

she's just like Oh Alton oh okay so

instantly a nice thing is me even though

potato point to who did this it actually

it would be a turnip and parson if I

could do it both turnip and parson a

point at paltin okay so I don't get

along with the little potato people so

that's why we're gonna take their word

for it tell me you didn't say that you

didn't do this I didn't do this then why

are they pointing at you I don't know I

don't I don't know what goes on their

little freaking produce heads jeez McKay

wisdom insight check dirty right what

what a dirty 20 a dirty 20 got it I

thought you said 30 20 and I'm like what

the heck is 30 earth you you think he's

being sincere you don't sense any

deception he I can't help but notice

Paulson you put a lot of emphasis on

that I as though I didn't I

is there someone else that we should

know about I was defending the person

being accused who was I okay that's good

I'm glad you didn't do it hey you know

I've been back for like not even that

long and already like all the shades

being thrown at me it's like you know

what I came back and I had a little fun

with it then I just know I don't storm

off again he does a half turn away and

yeah I'm only asking you because they're

pointing at you yeah bill pointing which

by the way is rude is there

there's someone around that looks a lot

like poultice that maybe just you know

they got confused there any other like

very handsome blond Bustani bard like

super handsome like yeah

super handsome yeah yeah interjecting

and kind of like uses handsome motion

and everyone to like kind of stop for a

moment and like condyles like Miranda I

think she did this and then death will

turn back to paulten but halton do you

remember everything you did last night

let's see so I let me start let me let

me see here so there was the bomb is

gonna go off

I did the thing that people didn't like

even though it certainly you know it

works but you know we're not we're not

talking about that right and then I yeah

I just I needed a night of reflection

and I just needed some time to myself to

you know cool off that's so important

taking time for reflection that's very

spiritual yes yes can I go to one of the

trees that's still alive that was near

the blast and Caspar plants burning

things and messing up and preaching yeah

so you can cast the spell as an action

for sure and plants within 30 feet of

you gained limited sentience and

animation giving the middlee to

communicate with you and follow your

simple commands and you can question

them about events in the spells area for

the past day gaining information about

creatures that have passed weather and

other circumstances so there you go you

cast the spell

and the trees the ones that are still

alive if you're most of them gain a

semblance of animation

and you realize that they are leaning in

toward you waiting to hear what you have

to say is this visible to like everyone

yeah so yeah oh oh oh that's oh that's

weird put my hands up into that I'm

gonna put Sophie down on the ground in

front of me and then I'm gonna put my

hands up into the branches and feel the

leaves that are close to me they're

there the tree is obviously in some pain

yeah as it as it feels your warm embrace

I want to try and soothe it as much as I

can but ask who did this the tree will

take one of it's not frozen boughs and

you hear it creak and groan and turn and

point at paltin no you're wrong he said

he didn't do it you really old evil and

even the trees even the trees do the

same thing till like four trees are

pointing J'Accuse at palton Halton

they're all pointing at you the ring is

taking over you if you truly don't

remember this if you truly did not do

this I think this ring is starting to

take control of you yeah it's bad magic

well maybe you should just take it off

for a while I don't know what you want

me to say to that because I have all

recollection of my and onion and like

the ring hasn't taken over me like how

it is no it doesn't so then you did this

on purpose

that is a loaded question that is fake

news and I don't appreciate it okay look

there was one time

long story Miranda but to all you know

all accusing eyes it looks like I might

have eaten the baby okay

and where would I be today no we each

other and we were evil and everything is

pointing at him if he truly didn't do it

then the ring is just taking over okay

if you take the ring off you're missing

the point

you're literally the point is I didn't

do this and there's a million ways that

someone could just oh my friends are

dead just take the ring off please

is it possible first RipStik

person on Paulsen uh yes I would like to

do that

okay palton mm-hmm roll again roll a d20

and add I think it's a wisdom saving

throw what level spell his whole person

it is second okay okay but I'm gonna

cast mmm but Polly could cast at a

higher level of shisho trip I would like

to okay okay I would like to catch okay

I'm going to fifth level counter spell

that okay I'm just like you do not need

to do that I don't understand why the

hell everyone wants to believe the trees

the trees out magicked her she just goes

it's just an attack let's all stop

casting spells that take away each

other's agency without consent okay

let's jump from that and let's

move on I'm I'm gonna fix em I'm just

gonna kneel down me be like I know last

time you freaked out I yelled at you and

I was very not cool and I'm very sorry

and I did not want to use magic on you

you were about to on me and I just did

what I had to do to keep things neutral

it was not a personal thing against you

you're still far better magic user than

I will ever be I'm not I mean not with

that attitude all right I'm sorry I just

see the ring is taking you over and I

just wanted to take it off because it's

it's really bad it's like this ring

doesn't work like that

halten my people made it this isn't some

like werewolf thing where I'm just

instantly like oh another thing is in my

body and I just don't recall anything no

like I understand the risk of this and I

know what it feels like for it to have

power but I remember where I was the

entire time and I know what I did and I

did not do that at this point at this

point Simon has come up alongside

paulten and just sort of takes his other

hand just like as he has done many many

times just to stand by his side maybe

maybe

Savan remembers

seeing something uh Simon he bored you

ah just select a little bit like a but

were you here when this happens and gift

like gesture towards all the ice and

everything and he turns back to paltin

and looks up Alton it's like don't don't

look at me he asked you the question he

turns back and nods

all right Simon did you see who caused

all of this ice he turns back to Politan

looks up at paltin they look back to you

and goes alright Simon at this point you

hear coming through some of the the

trees there's a loud rustling noise ah

heck

and then bursting interview is waffles

and she just sort of flying tackles

strix out of frame yeah and then she

just sort of turns into a ball of fur

and rolls strix over top of her and is

just like playing with strix like a

little cat with a yarn ball doing it so

rough they're just kinda like bleep

well she's roughing up chicks playfully

you see dragon bait and the baby

Triceratops trying to keep up they seem

to be about you know thirty yards back

but making their way through some of the

foliage and dragon bait is swinging a

sword and clearing some of the the vines

and things out of his way but it's clear

that they've made their way back to you

followed by waffles sniffer completely

distracted by this evil and grabs

morning-glories like I'm so excited to

reintroduce you to waffle yeah once

waffles is done playing with Strix sit

there just sitting with a big rump down

as Morning Glory comes up to her and

waffles will just sort of turn her head

the way owls turn their heads around way

way way to one side as she looks at this

strange creature again for the first

time in a while

I'm so cute my heart hurts you've been

doing all of this gift like stamps

and while that all is going on and just

very quickly says Simon was it paltin

here who froze everything in this area

he looks back at paltin

and says Oh No

okay yeah it's tricks while this

revelation is causing DF to have an

aneurysm she's gonna walk over to dragon

bait and like grab a snack from her robe

and and just like hold it out he'll be

like thank you for taking care of them

you're a good whatever you are

it'll take the snack in his hand and

smell it and and put his hand around it

and save it for later okay it's probably

seen does he still have boot with him uh

yes he would still have your he would

still have celery with him for sure you

see you see a little celery with the

boot ambling behind him celery doesn't

move as fast as the others do so he's a

little behind and that momentarily

distracts you from the horror show and

you also can see the earth interrogating

the marionette I'm gonna grab the ones

that are alive and just sort of hug them

as close as I can you've got three left

or four crows I'm gonna approach palton

and still keep my distance but just get

a little closer and Walton is there do

you have a twin or something is there a

reason that everything else thinks that

it's you who she says it just kind of

goes but strikes just like totally

nonchalantly turns her and it's like oh

yeah I made pies for these hags once and

I put our hair at it and I'm pretty sure

they made clones of us but I don't know

if they can clone magic items maybe they

can I don't know but I'm guessing it's

bad and she was like walks away yep

oh my god you're so weird oh this group

is so weird but I like you guys okay any

port in a storm right close very close

yeah sure huh after Strix explains the

the doppelgangers like all new Stern's

Miranda it's like that's the thing at

this party whether you think it's option

a B or C we're usually like

that's still a good option okay I'm

sorry I'm sorry

and I I got upset very quickly they're

literally all I have these three are the

only thing that I have all of my friends

are dead

yeah it's like knocking himself in the

head just like oh my god the clones all

right listen

it's possible we are gonna burn

ourselves quick we have to burn

ourselves why I mean what no I don't

like that idea well hold on maybe it's

possible that someone else I mean they

do have to make copies on us but they

didn't they didn't did you can't

recreate magical well anything's are

feathers we have they just made me make

us magic some of us know magic eh it's

palton could learn that magic maybe

maybe I don't

it's very possible that this he could be

being set up or they're doing this on

purpose to drive and drive us apart at

the same time maybe it's possible that

it could be the ring that's also a

chance I need to tell you guys what I

saw back wood were trying to get after

res nice you when I was and I got

separated from the rest of you I don't

know where I went or how it wasn't it

wasn't a dream it it was real everything

there was real and I know it was but

some other escape or existence I don't

know how to describe it but it felt

prophetic I was I somehow I was back in

water deep water deep was frozen over

everything covered in snow and in ice

clouds blotted out the sky there was no

more Sun Strix was gone replaced with a

bunch of rats that was that was weird

but I also saw paltin

the ring had completely taken him over

his eyes weren't his anymore he talked

to me like he wanted to he wanted to

torture me and destroy me that felt very

real and I think for some reason we

can't figure out this ring and destroy

it and get rid of it that's what's going

to happen so regardless of clones if

whoever did this that ring cannot stay I

was just like not there at all even

extra difficultly turned to evil and

like you can kind of see like the

recollection of fear and a spacious like

you weren't anywhere yeah that's all

right you know main character Miranda's

gonna try and lean closer to Colton to

look in his eyes really intently okay so

you lean in Hey

[Laughter]

are you looking for something in

particular is there any change in his

eyes at all change in his eyes yeah he a

normal change you would say a little bit

of you know oscillation based on your

process up in proximity okay hi please

Regina you know what I don't trust that

ring think all right um I'm tired of all

this stuff about always lie all the

Rings taking over you Baba's like you

know what it's fine I'm just gonna I

just look at that look the ring is off

now putt you would let me finish

damn standings holy crap

it's gonna be in my pocket because we

are going to figure out what to do with

this ring are we are we are we happy now

I know I shouldn't trust you but I am

really happy so cool that's why I

haven't taken the ring off because I

could deal this whole time it might be

in the future

Thank You papa Pauling you're feeling

alright yeah I mean you know now I'm

like dying again that kind of sucks but

well you've still got you still got

booyah you've still got the other ring

the weird protection that protects you

from the dying death curse I think you

took out the ring at winter right huh

yeah so you still have the ritual ring

and somewhere you know evylyn signet

ring though I don't know where you're

keeping it right like and yeah now it's

like it's it's called but aside from

that is it called it's colder here on

the edge of this effect that seems to

have frozen to death

all those budget pygmies even doesn't

know you wouldn't know that's true Chris

there was a time where d/f tried to

remove the ring from palton yes Klaus

right and he seemed to have a very

different attitude about that during

then mmm-hmm so knowing that yeah

how much does deaath trust in the leave

what paltin is doing now um you can make

an insight check alright I will

okay

oh good Jared it's okay

16 okay so well you saw him take off the

ring no big deal

stuff it into his something into his

belt pouch that's surprising a little

bit that it was so easy but on the other

hand you also saw the ring in possession

of artists and there were times when

artists was able to take off the ring

without any problem I did also see

paltin put it on hand drew and use that

to get it away yes you don't see the

hand by the way hand isn't here where's

the hand where's the hand you know your

brofist er guy mm-hmm yeah you lost that

okay kind of okay I didn't want to talk

about that what do you talk about it

he'd he got lost in the cold in my

really stupid time of reflection which I

wish I didn't even have to take he uh

yeah I'll just say the snow was very

deep where did you go I don't know where

he went I took my time to reflect and

there was a bit where I'd I did lose

track assignment but Andrew did not

you're talking about snow being deep

where did you go for your moment of

reflection how were you in snow dude I

went far man I was out far you can go in

like three hours with multiple dimension

doors no I know far oh yeah it was

pretty far can I use detect magic on the

ring and tell if anything has changed

about it sure you can cast the spell all

right

alright I'm gonna do that okay just like

Aladdin when Aladdin gets you know in

that tower that goes all the way like

the snowy place all right sorry you're

just casting the spell so when you cast

the spell on palm direction and

everybody can tell that you're you're

casting the spell but an interesting

thing happens the ring and everything

else about paltin glows with a singular

aura there's not separate auras on his

magic items he and everything about him

is all one aura and it's illusion what

what do you mean it's not what the hell

is that mean

now you felt if he's an illusion he's

the solidus delusion you've ever felt

evil yeah yeah pulls out a blade right

away just like who the hell are you

either your entirety as an illusion

because marina is a custom yet or you're

casting something yeah he has a heart he

has a heartbeat evylyn you've felt it

when you you know grabbed him by the

shoulders yeah paulten uh looks at

Miranda this you are really good at

running your mouth and he just sits down

just like like hands over his knees

takes out some wine doesn't and then it

takes a chug

you just like

guess you'll have to find out and he

takes out his sword yep and turns it on

himself and just when he does that you

see him turn to ice and snow the ice

becomes slush in the heat of the blade

he completely discs or / eights into a

pile of slush leaving nothing behind but

Simon and the sword hilt as he's like

that come over he's like doing that and

turns on self Diaz Sprint's forward and

like tackle grabs Simon and like tumbles

of wage like kind of get Simon away from

paulten okay yeah you basically yeah you

take Simon uh and and just sort of roll

with him away as palton dissolves into

snow and slush okay that's paltin

flavored slushy which is the worst kind

strix what happened you know magic she's

just digging a hole like well I don't

know anything he knew Bethany wasn't she

just starts crying on the ground what is

this why why is this the last thing left

and she just starts like banging it on a

rock and if you do something while she's

crying she's still doing this Arcana

check through the tears yeah that's a

dirty 20 so you have seen this happen

before yes somebody you thought was

Pelton in Ravenloft turned out got hit

by a fireball and turned to ice and

slush this is exactly the same thing you

believe you believe it is a simulacrum

Alton and what that means is well with

your great role you know two things one

he

entirely created out of ice and snow and

given the semblance of life this is not

something you knew the ring could do but

maybe paltin ken yeah it's very powerful

in him but you know that the simulacrum

belongings aren't real they turn to

slush as well so he must have gotten the

sword off of the real paltin right so

the real paltin is somewhere without the

sword yes right so strix is just gonna

stop digging for a second and just like

cold bullard pipe add up and be like the

real paulson is probably in danger I

think he I think he's he's trapped

somewhere because that sword was his

evylyn is just kneeling by the place

where where the slush is just sort of

settled into a lump there partner oh so

flop flop off the side and she like

takes and pushes it back up into this

volcano like a lump yeah strix what

about the ring Miranda can the ring do

this could the ring I made this no idea

I know that it's evil I know that it's

terrible I know we tried to destroy it

and gotten more powerful since the last

time we heard of it Miranda you know

that it has several prescribed powers

but over the years it has been used to

greater effect by certain creatures you

and there was some hint that the the

frost giants we're gonna use it to

freeze the world that was something that

was told to you back when Sangala was

helping to chase down the item with you

she feared that the frost giants were

gonna use it to freeze the world so it

has great power locked inside it but you

it's unclear how that power comes out it

can do any myriad of things from what I

have heard it it's it's so powerful it's

so incredibly powerful we should not

have let him have this for this long I

need to get this back I need to destroy

this this is this is this could be bad

this could be very bad even though it's

ink

be painful for her to let go of the

magical item she goes to evil in and she

hands her that helped and she goes you

should hold on to this this is important

to you you need to have this until we

find him you muted maybe not I can't

hear you okay yeah so you've got this

relic of paltin now in your hand this

golden hilt over to evylyn and puts her

hands on her shoulder and she doesn't

usually touch anyone so she puts her

hand on her shoulder and she looks at it

weird robot eyes and says you need to go

talk to let's say ender right now no one

here can help you only let the ender can

okay yeah just like turns her around and

just like pushes her or it's where she

can go like crazy toward us toward like

a beam of sunlight right now he was just

holding the sword and kind of like yeah

okay when you sort of step out into the

light evylyn the Sun kind of hits the

sword and reflects off your face are you

talking to him she's never wandering

through the sunlight the F that you can

see Simon is not trying to wrestle his

way out of your grip but he doesn't want

to be held down forever yeah yeah like

I'll release them okay it's down there

just sort of dust himself off yeah and

I'll say Simon he looks up at you hey

just stay with us for now we're gonna

find your dad okay just this day with us

we make sure we'll get him back turns

back districts did you see that paltin

touch my shoulders what do you think

that maybe Manor cockatoo Lysander but

but what do you think so none of that

was real

yeah none of that was of course it

wasn't real no none of that was real

right right so it was real a simulacrum

is still the person it's it's still no

he's melted bet he melted before you

remember yeah but he was still Paulson

we didn't know he wasn't Paulson but we

really shouldn't fall for this again

because we know that is dumb we are so

darling every person we meet from now on

gets burned just a little bit

no me no your little burn you burn me no

more burns to go over to evylyn and

trying to help because that's her

default mode cheat sheet makes a whole

ton of sunflowers just a whole bunch and

she she like throws them in the air

around evylyn to try and be like she

makes an entire bouquet and she hands

them off and she goes please okay our

god that's like trying to stop a crying

child with like toys exactly what it is

even kind of like comes to seeing these

two women trying so desperately to cheer

her up and like blooms like the center

of attention and everyone's caring about

her feelings right now and she's like oh

oh I'm fine I'm totally fine I'm sorry

no I this will be fine we'll get through

it together we'll find palton we always

do and how do you feel are you okay this

has been very traumatic Miranda you just

lost all your friends here she gives her

a big hug she's like don't worry you

said they're all you have but that's not

true you have us

don't worry oh thank you so if you're

sort of coupled in the middle of this

sort of puddle of sunflowers lying on

the ground around you can yeah I wanted

to make you happy um can you can you

talk to Lysander I I'm really worried

about your friend

I'm worried that he's he's in danger

Ethan kind of looks at Strix and at

Miranda and she's like this is the first

time anyone's ever asked me to talk to

Evander before

I'm not power and she's nice so just

bleep okay

she takes both their hands and she kind

of like like great morning Lord hear the

voice of these three your servants so

while that's going on yes death

approaches dragon bait and just asked

him he smells like honeysuckle right he

was like he was out in a way and kind of

locked it out for a while did he happen

to see anything with paulten what could

have pop possibly caused this or if you

saw where he went

no he just shakes his head damn it and

then it's right his mouth changes to

brimstone which you know is the smell of

confusion and then to ham which is

nervousness and worry

yeah well that's going on da-fu see

Simon he's just sort of walking off no

no Simon how'd you like their hands out

like kind of hunched over like after was

like no no come on

anyway so I could do that God speaks

through the mouth yeah oh yeah totally

she just crawls away like actually no

to crawl around everything he was very

worried that she will step on one of

them so she flies yeah okay you sorry

follows death and she grabs Morning

Glory and she's like dear you could you

so if Simon leads the way diesel stayed

nearby um and trying to protect him as

much as Boston okay just like a pace or

two behind him yeah yeah okay Simon

begins to lead you through Oh Moo in the

morning you find yourself kind of

meandering through the streets

d/f you feel a needle of ice jam through

your skull through the middle of your

brain and you are so wracked with pain

that you take 25 points of psychic

damage oh what'd you take its of psychic

damage and immediately as this needle is

jammed into your head you can't do

anything except just kind of hunched

over and almost collapse in on yourself

Simon sort of stops when you keel over

does anyone behind him see where it came

from it didn't seem to come from the

rest of you just see DF just sort of

clutched his head lurched forward and

let out this gas of as you as the

horrible horrible pain this this needle

grinds into your brain you see just

blood coming out of your nose and out of
