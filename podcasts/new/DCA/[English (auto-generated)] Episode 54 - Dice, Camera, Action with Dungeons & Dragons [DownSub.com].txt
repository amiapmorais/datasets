hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action previously previously in dice

camera action the waffle crew was drawn

into burrow via a dark domain ruled by a

vampire named straw vanzara ovitch among

the stranger things you discovered is

that strawed had the power to basically

eavesdrop and command the shadows of vus

tani causing them to animate and behave

oddly and you discovered this because

paltin shadow began to kind of act on

its own accord and at the toward the end

of your stay in burrow via during the

final confrontation with straud palton

shadow broke away and was dispelled and

he has been without his shadow

ever since recently the characters were

in Citadel add bar split up palton and

evylyn together DF and Strix together

paltin and Evelyn were at a dwarven

tavern when the darkness seemed to close

around them and they disappeared in a

way and found themselves in strods

throne room back in burrow via my

surprise yes

moments after returning here to a place

familiar to paltin you heard footsteps

in a hall outside and the doors opened

an inn stepped a svelte pallid young man

with long blond hair and dressed in a

dark purple long coat with shirt that

has

kind of the color of marrow to it with

lacy sleeves and a lacy collar and as he

steps toward you he bowed before you

paltin and addressed you as my lord

and you recognize him as the vampire

spawned a sure one of strods thralls i

did miss my boo yes and he as he stands

in the doorway the threw a large open

circular window in one wall a stream of

evening light quite bright and gold

begins to shine through and immediately

he just sort of leaps out of the way of

the beam of light and it shines on the

door behind him and he sort of advances

toward you to get out of it and often

the distance you can hear a distant

thunder it's very soft and far away and

he says to you palton the master has

brought you here to become one with the

dark powers and take your rightful place

as Lord of this land your friends are

invited to the wedding after which you

will bid them farewell and as you stand

there and he draws near you can smell

that there he's using perfume to hide

what is basically a stench of death that

kind of surrounds him and outside over

the sound of the Thunder you can hear

they the clopping of horse hooves in the

clatter of a carriage far down in the

courtyard below

and it gets louder and louder and louder

and usher kind of looks off over his

shoulder back toward the window and says

your bride she comes now what now and he

looks you up and down and what you're

wearing you're wearing this Raven

costume he took off the head yeah looks

like you ready to go yeah yeah he took

it off he took up that so he doesn't

have the head piece with him but he's

got the rest of it and he looks you up

and down kind of disapprovingly he says

we have to get you fitted for a suit I

do have several questions but I will

also never say no to a good suit he says

so the wedding is tonight hmm okay

we don't have much time you and the

minister are meant to be one again and

then he leans in very close to you and

says if you run the master will just

bring you back only next time without

your friends

[Laughter]

okay once you've consummated your

marriage embrace to the darkness

mmm-hmm you can do them your bride to

the catacombs estrade has done with all

of his then we can be together yeah

you're standing right there even when

even as a construct stand still yes

does her construct body make any noise

nothing external you can sort of feel

things sort of vibrating in you but no

you don't make any unless you want to I

mean you can actually do I know I could

speak but like she's definitely having

some she's trying to be quiet

halten made her invisible yeah but if

she like if she like just sort of shifts

or there might be like your wedding is

tonight the marriage there's probably

some sort of like I like I like try to

cover up the noises by magic I'm just

like very hard to like just wait and see

you what palton because she does not

understand what's going on at all

okay so I say to him like I feel like

there might have been mail that I didn't

get because this is relatively news to

me he says you have nothing to worry

about you're perfectly safe

in fact you're perfect in every way

thank you I've missed you too you have

the blood of King marathon is Arabic and

the Bustani flowing through your veins

huh but you did leave something of

yourself behind did I know

okay well let's how about how about we

get me suited up and we can continue

this conversation and you know if there

were anyone who were quietly joining us

very subtly not that I'm saying they

should but no one is but but wink

[Laughter]

assurer will smile and then he'll turn

to you for the first acknowledge you for

the first time

evylyn ah and yeah and he says you will

be safer with your friends and he's

looking at me yes I tackle him okay okay

you hurl yourself bodily at the at the

vampire is it your intention to just

knock him to the floor to grapple him

okay so go ahead and make a strength

athletics check I like those with their

robots drinks yeah raise robot strength

I don't have any additional strength but

it's still good

it is 19 okay so yes you hurl yourself

at measure you catch him completely off

guard and you tackle him to the floor of

the throne Hall I'm just like sitting on

him on the floor holding him down as a

gold little tiny robot yes and then I

look at Paulson I'm like what in the

name of the holy morning Lord is going

on a lot you can hear the sound of the

large castle doors the main entrance of

the castle opening up far below you out

into the courtyard and you can hear

rattling and stuff like people getting

out of a carriage down below but you

can't see anything other than that

you're alone up here you're engaged

apparently and you're engaged but you

like this guy oh that's like that's like

I'm stuck if you are we it's complicated

yeah the Castle Rock loft did you say

straw

did I hear straw something about straw I

don't see you took straw out of his

domain but you left a piece of him

behind a piece where

that is the master that what I'm holding

his hands down and I'm like what's that

like he DF and Strix

oh you guys are standing out you were

standing on a Ledge in Citadel ad bar

overlooking a busy underground

thoroughfare with dwarves and stuff your

quarry had eluded you and no sign of

Kihara queue had just died athlet used

this sword to someone near Colonel Eoff

who is now gone yes it is at that time

that the voices of the dwarves seemed to

fade and get farther away and there

slowly sort of they kind of dissolve

away into darkness and the darkness just

begins to surround you until the only

light the only light is basically the

red gleaming gem of your sword but that

light is barely enough it's weaker than

a candle light and it's barely enough to

illuminate even the walls or ledge

around you and so you suddenly find the

two of you in darkness now Strix you

have dark vision you can see in a moment

in an instant that the surroundings

changed from Citadel ad bar to a a dark

study walls lined with ancient tomes a

dark hearth above which there is a large

framed portrait of a beautiful woman yes

other months you recognized comfortable

chairs laid about you remember one point

there was a dead cleric this is strods

study you're standing you're standing on

an old rug there are doors all around

you but it is pitch black nothing is lit

here except for that little red gleaming

gem in the pile of sword

Strix make a perception check hey Dee

there's like reaching out trying to find

Strix as any kind of just like bad day

bad day bad

day bad day oh my gosh I got a 14-1

feature that was not present before that

is present now in one corner in front of

a door is a standing suit of armor

that's headless it's just oh the body

down and it's just standing in front of

the door oh great

drift globe it's kind of a dark armor

baroque old and almost antiquated style

and you pull out your drift globe when

that happens there is enough light to

death that you can see that you're in

this gothic study yeah I recognize it I

recognize the picture of arena or some

reincarnation of her on above the

fireplace mantel wasn't there before

don't point at it and then slowly batter

myself with the ample light salad you're

concerned about because right now we're

back at freakin Perot via with the I've

soiled my drawers okay are you happy

with the ample light you both see

something else there is a shadow being

cast on the wall that doesn't seem to

have a source it is humanoid could be a

figure who now the shadow sort of

stretched out and elongated but it could

be a human figure but it's wearing a

cloak and I'd like you both to make

perception checks your first instinct is

that it's the shadow of strawed because

it's got the sort of effects tricks

blown away I've got it Strix has gone

under the desk

they've gone under the desk as you're

cowering underneath the desk I can see

that it would be stride except that the

head seems to look more like paltin no

don't tell that to DF and then be like

is there any wine in this room let's

call it let's call it straw he's trying

to pull you under the desk with her does

he joins her okay you cower under the

desk

rocking back and forth a little bit

she's like stop stop he'll hear us back

in the throne Hall Asher says to you

evylyn surprised by the the weight to

the Chur sort of forcing him down with

he says what are you going to do slap me

with your puppet hands invitation I just

kind of laugh at him and I'm like what

is your deal why did you bring us here I

didn't do anything

the master brought you here he did that

because he has the power to he has the

power to because he and palton are meant

to be together they are one and I'm like

I I have him grappled and I'm like

getting really frustrated with him so at

this point I'm kind of like I even like

take his little hand and I'm like waving

it around I'm like an you who is the

master let's clear this like clear this

up come on come be forthcoming who's the

master he said I too would also like to

know I fiends to me he says

your shadow to paltin his shadow is his

master

I don't think that's usually how it

works the dark powers want to reclaim

this land a piece of Strada is in your

shadow

I look at Pelton like do you have any

idea what this lunatic is raving about

[Music]

no I look at him accent I think he's ill

I think he needs help

you need something I don't recognize

this place Paulson where are we where uh

somewhere not stellar okay I thought you

said something about or he said

something about you having been here

before have you been here before

oh I mean we've all been somewhere you

know I mean yes in a philosophical sense

of course we are all somewhere together

in the light and love of the morning

Lord that is very deep so lighten that

morning all of that absolutely you're so

right shout out shout out to to that

morning Lord yeah so distracted us to be

focused on this mortal world when really

that is what it's all about

well what so what do you propose we do

from here are you dressing that to

palton yeah - uh sure

okay I'm ignoring Asher completely I'm

just sitting on him

yep and he doesn't seem to be at this

point fighting you he's just kind of

lying there on the floor

say well you should probably let that

one stand back up I look at him why I

wouldn't label him as a at the moment

why can he see me when I'm invisible

yeah why can't he why can't you see me

when I'm invisible he says well actually

he doesn't say anything he just rolls

his red eyes evylyn looks very put upon

and then just like uh stands up and

steps back and tries to fold her arms

but she's still not really used to how

her arms work so she kind of like ends

up like like this alright yeah yeah sure

we'll get back to his feet try try to

muster up as much decorum as he can

given the circumstances you hear the

doors of the castle far below shut with

a loud thunk that goes throughout the

courtyard you hear the whinny of some of

a pair of horses the huffing and the

stopping of hooves you said I'd be safer

with my friends am I in danger

asure says not presently alright great

well this place is not stellar as you

said Carlton and we are not in immediate

danger and you said this guy's not a

threat so I think it's time to go and

find death and strict let's go and she

turns and like tries to rush her Politan

out of the room and leave okay Paulson

are you going to let her uh before we go

well I'm gonna talk to her they say yes

on that note you said you said friends

plural are they here

yes they're here they like the shadow

you left here are part of him now in

like a spiritual sense something like

that okay I'm gonna put a pin in that

statement um can can can they be like

here in like with uh can I can we see

them through walls no if you want to see

them we can go and see them

yes that sounds nice thank you please

sure that that works that works for me

all right

he turns and then he sees the light is

still streaming through the evening

light is still streaming through the

window and he can't even get close to

the doors at this point so he calls out

Cyrus Cyrus and then the doors you hear

a clop clop clop clop clop outside and

then the door peels open and a

degenerate mongrel folk steps in

carrying a lantern that's sort of

flickering and sputtering and you

recognize him paulten as Cyrus Bellevue

this this horrid creature this Murrow

like human that's been basically

transformed into various animals all

sort of collage together and usher will

say lord paltin wants to see his other

friends at lord palton i kind of raised

an eyebrow a little mechanical eyebrow

is this the same is this the same like

lantern dude who was like keeping the

prison that I yes exactly

okay I see him I'm like I'm just like

and he says it's about time it's good to

see you too friend let's go okay I am a

banquets of rare oh you throw the best

parties dude I am I am ecstatic and an

Escher tells Cyrus when you're done

bring him to his quarters we'll have him

fitted for a suit okay I'm just like you

know it I'll be waiting for you there my

love

it's like I'll be seeing you there dude

with each of these conversations like he

recognizes this weird person I've never

seen before he seems to have this

relationship with Usher who I also have

never seen before and so evylyn is like

slowly but surely kind of like getting

quiet and like you just observe it here

because she has no idea what's going on

yes as this degenerate mongrel pleads

you out Ashur says one more thing and

it's ours like what he turns around

don't let him see the bride not yet mmm

yes bad luck I'm fine and this the

Jenner creature will lead you out as

we're being led I like

lean over I lean over too

why is my clean doing that anyway I lean

over in the evil and I whisper I'm just

like don't worry I have no idea what I'm

doing it's very complicated we have like

kind of a rocky history and I don't want

to get into it because bringing up exes

is kind of weird but um so uh you know

but you're not like in league with evil

or anything right cuz this seems kind of

like you're in league with evil putting

another pin in that one well we'll get

to it don't worry I got this yes you're

making your way through this sort of

cobweb strewn halls and dark passages

and staircases of the castle seemingly

descending into it and ascending into

its innards you become very quickly

disoriented and lost as this mongrel

folk leads the way Strix and EF as you

cozy up underneath this big desk waffle

sort of squeezes between the two of them

here doesn't quite know what's going on

but she feels quite comfortable nestled

between the two of you under here and as

you know as you watch as you watching

your drift go globe light the shadow of

Stratton does seem to be moving slowly

across the wall I hate this so much here

no we have a standard the desk starts to

just like tidy it up like snow Strix

none of us are going to live in Peru

just starts crying and going waffles

you'll make a great bed all right and

while you're doing that you can hear

footsteps coming upstairs behind one of

the doors and then the suit of armor

clunk clunk clunk moves out of the way

as the door opens and light spills in

from a lantern held by a degenerate

mongrel folk creature behind which stand

palton and evylyn but they've never seen

right they have not but a dim light it

looks superficially like you ok do I see

them under the desk not not at first at

first I'll have you in public perception

checks first we just see this kind of

old gothic library with high ceilings

and big portraits and old lamps molded

to the walls and paneling and a big

big padded chairs and a nice desk and

all of that but you might hear them

what's your role

I roll an uncharacteristic 18 okay okay

13 okay yeah so

evylyn you do hear sort of scrabbling

underneath the desk and it actually

might hear a little sound from waffles

that you recognize I immediately

recognize strike those voices I assume

yes because this is the sound they

usually make I immediately launch myself

down there and I'm like damn straight as

soon as it comes into the light you just

see this animatronic evil and I'm like

crawling in there with them her face is

not moving sort of entirely naturally

and you can hear very soft little Wars

and cliques from inside her artificial

body literally right up into the light

she's just like oh is there like a mod

Ron now that's fine and she just gives

her a hug Linda's arms I'm just like

cuddled up against her like she's

holding is the first time she's ever

given her a hug and she's like I don't

think you can smell me which is great

for you it's an initial response to

actually panic in that he actually like

scoots back on his using his hands and

feet like from from under the table sake

you know almost comes out like what's a

hand to a sword right away as is bizarre

constructs suddenly gets way too close

way too fast and knows our names yep

restricts immediately believes it's me

and it's fine I mean she's seen stuff

like this before it's nothing new this

is weird

scuttling under the desk to be restricts

paltin you get it and you see DfE who's

come to

pulling out the other side you know

exactly what's going on you're also

standing right next to what appears to

be an animated suit of armor I I say

it'd be if I'm like it's fine that's

evil in and surprisingly enough that's

not the weirdest thing going on right

now we should chat like this is why I'm

looking back and forth but is

immediately relieved seeing that paltin

is still alive and also relieved that is

alive but looking back at her like you

can't help but feel a sense of sadness

or perhaps even pity and whatever it is

that she's become yeah you guys didn't

even know that I was around no we

thought you were dead yeah also strict

soul like like release the hog Greg

realizing that she's hugged me hugging

you and like me like I'm just so happy

we didn't have to go to the celestial

plane like oh that would have been such

a trouble so even when Strix releases

the hug Elin keeps like as she's talking

to her keeps trying to like grab her

hand or like lean on or something she's

like that no just once my girlfriend

what Pope Alton what you want your

severed hand to do I was just gonna ask

if he's still with me like what right as

I say like we we've got other stuff

going on can he just like kind of crawl

up on the Dia's shoulder yes so death

make a perception check role the

crawling claws stealth check okay so you

don't notice until it is crawled

literally up on your shoulder and then

you see this black severed desiccated

hand right there uh at this point in

time until death reacts probably not

okay so just yes at which point

everybody sees the hand go flying from D

s grip across the room come on dude and

that's like scuttling back toward you

what did I say about picking things up

from the ground you said always do that

and then maybe eat it

it's not magic figs so the attention

will kind of go back to robot evylyn and

he'll uh

almost crawled back forward to her and

like not really sure how he's supposed

to interact with her like he wants to

like put like a hand up to her and like

kind of touch her and make sure like

this is actually her it's real but kind

of like stops himself just yeah it's

clear it's clear that she is not a real

person but you get the sense touching

her that you have no doubt that it's her

I like veal right in front of death and

I kind of realized what he's going

through that's like oh yeah I look super

weird and this was super weird like you

know ten hours ago uh and so I just kind

of like kneel in front of him and kind

of look in his eyes and I hold out one

hand like this it's just like letting

him touch it yeah so he'll kind of take

hold of it almost meekly yeah and it's

room temperature her hand yeah which is

not normal I killed it's kind of whisper

a like just the deepest concern his eyes

and just says like well fix you you can

see in her face that like she kind of

already had the Eaglin mask on but as

soon as you say that like something kind

of breaks and she looks like very deeply

sad but thankful and she's just like you

always do I've never had a friend

I took I turn no I'm just like come on

I'm right here

strikes is like do you want some sneaky

Snooks he looks at you pulled me says

I'm just your servant oh don't don't

come on don't be like that

so offer him like a piece of jerky or

something like come on where are your

friends

a stranger whoever you are I mean you're

one of those weird people I guess I

don't eat strange food well they were

not really good and so let's put it back

in for

I only make friends with people they

need strange speaking of which I'm

supposed to prepare your wedding feast

and you're supposed to be get dressed

come here and you're not supposed to be

giving me any lip

I offered friendship but I can stop

being nice if you want

yes master damn finally darts up to his

feet wedding feast yeah I think what is

happening just like yeah I'm a little

scared Strix will go back under the desk

even keep like see see he's getting

married to the dark powers banquet dark

hours what see okay strict so like peek

out from under the desk be like this is

not okay oh it needs its Dark Lord no it

doesn't I hadn't really should with dark

powers before it didn't go great I

turned to him I'm just like thank you

now we'll be all wait outside the door

and I'll be out momentarily yes master

I think eyes that click so guys what I

know what you're thinking I know what

you're thinking and it's complicated but

basically I'm kind of so I don't

know what to do kind of panicking

thoughts Strix what do we do we leave I

mean we drugged leave we're stuck here

we were stuck here before and now we're

stuck here again my why are we stood I I

don't know can I do an arc on a check to

see like why we're stuck absolutely okay

19 which bless my Arcana is like oh my

gosh it's a lot of like 24 okay um you

haven't been brought up to speed yet on

everything that they know about how you

were brought here or who brought you

back here but

if your planer Lord does you any credit

you know that okay so you captured

straud in that puppet and you took him

out of his domain and after he was

trapped in the puppet you were able to

leave his domain essentially the borders

of mist fell and you could escape now to

the best of your knowledge that puppet

hasn't returned Oh possible it could

have in which case you know strata

probably be released by now the shadow

on the wall that you saw tells you that

it's possible that that had some hand

and bringing paltin back because they

were that is a piece of pollen and

here's the thing if I did it once it

could do it again look the last thing we

all want is for palton to be okay

so we're gonna figure out how I could

say something about that but I'm not

going to well you make your own

decisions about what you want to say win

but I'm just saying what's the deal with

the shadow thing let's figure it out

let's go we we could whoa that is not

ideal because you notice you notice how

we were just kind of brought here and if

we left they do it again and then their

shadow is he in here still with us he's

still just like hanging out the shadow

uh yeah when you look around you can see

that it has moved it is but it is

casting itself on a wall and you don't

know if they can hear you or what paltin

go smash yourself against that guy

that's magic

crush yourself against the shadow stick

it back to your feet or something I've

always hated that thing

can I let go can I would just walk over

doing like just kind of investigated yes

and as you approach it it moves away

from you come on dude

so like it just keeps moving away I

can't get near it

correct and situation strikes we'll pull

out the flask and throw it at paltin and

say try this I don't know if it'll work

but there's no one in it currently

because I made a big mistake

I'll tell you about that later I was

going to ask if this is occupied but it

is not okay I'm a big old dummy

Oh God a dummy Thank You evilly but I am

a dummy thank you I guess

can i okay I - get in the flask yeah you

can unplug it and say the command word

which you know to be 0th yeah and try to

will the creature into the flask and

when you do so it doesn't seem to have

any effect that's probably because it is

native to this place it don't work well

they give it back to me okay I can make

some more mistakes thank you go back to

the room

okay I like I'm gonna like wave to it

okay maybe you can make friends it

turns into a large back like humanoid

form the cloak essentially becoming

wings I like which drawn my wave but

like like all shadows it is dead silent

no no see it's wings begin to spread

across the wall of the room the 40-foot

wall of the room like a secret exit out

of this place before go have any kind of

inkling that I could I don't know you

just other something I could like

interact with it somehow that is a good

question you can make an Arcana check oh

oh okay well that's yeah that'd be a

five okay you're not sure in its current

form you can even really communicate

with it in any conventional way now it's

possible that there could be a spell or

a ritual maybe even in one of these

hundred hundreds of thousands of tomes

surrounding you that might shed some

light on it but that might take some

time

yeah we don't have a lot of that yeah

and so there are a number of doors out

of here

there is the door to the staircase that

you just came up there is a set of

double doors and then there are two

single doors out of the room oh right so

yeah we could just just run and leave

yep

last time we ran in a secret door the

secret door is the one we use to the

staircase that's the one that they came

through okay I thought we agreed we

needed to reattach the shadow to paulten

to solve this problem if we were to

leave where would we even go this is my

house now I live under this desk you

ever reattached a shadow to a person oh

no have you ever detached a shadow from

person

no do you know anything about attacking

shadows I don't think so but I can

search my wealth of knowledge go ahead

shall I do it and arcana check again in

the meantime while she's really 16 okay

um you believe it might be possible

through some sort of ritual to do so

you're not sure how what magic or power

strawed used to break off the the shadow

other than he's a super powerful uber

Dark Lord but undoubtedly there is a

magical way to accomplish this goal what

if we just destroy the shadow with what

with that's kind of him but that's more

important Lord are you gonna do that I

punch it divine smite I just punched the

wall where it is okay so you go over and

strike the wall

with your fists boom yeah

that doesn't seem to have any effect on

the shadow but it does cause the

animated suit of armor to sort of clench

its fists and begin marching in your

direction listen to me

maybe no maybe don't we can't do any of

this and you see it just sort of throw a

chair that weighs about a hundred and

fifty pounds aside like it's nothing and

it goes tumbling across the room to get

to you

it doesn't walk around the CH it just

pushes it even kind of has like a half

smile on her face I'm gonna yell at it

and just tell it to stand down in hopes

that it'll listen alright it stands down

oh okay

breaking stuff no bueno running no bueno

if I know these guys we're in a night

the most ideal position we could be in

right now and we're not in immediate

danger and we need to use this to figure

out something that'll actually work

except for it fake the dark powers are

trying to make you into strong it was

like pointed palton idea right and that

doesn't sound great but if we run it'll

only make things worse

what if we let it happen and you do this

planet you become the Dark Lord right

then you're the king of all this realm

and then with your new king powers you

dissolve the anarchy

or the hierarchy and just like done no

more no more Kings no more counts you

use your rear count powers and you just

be done with it all I don't know yeah I

think you need a snack I think he needs

a snack he does I listen to that play

I'm just like well not hold on with that

that wouldn't work would that work going

no of course I wouldn't work that'd work

and then you could declare a new Empire

oh this we're talking about evil here

about darkness you are literally a

bastion of light you need to play

yourself a song play something enjoy in

the world like she hands him like she's

like grabs his bagpipe from his back and

like shoves it into adjacent so like

making really sad like I'm just holding

the bagpipe like I appreciate the kind

words they might not be entirely true

but the gesture is received thank you

we're going to go back to planning now

maybe shadow wants to hear a song I'm

just saying what if the puppet is back

it could be through one of the single

one of the single doors to the room

opens up and a kind of withered old man

that you've never met before with

slightly askew spectacles walks in and

you can see he's got a little bag in his

arms so he sort of closes the door with

his bum and they just sort of waddles

around the room trying not to disrupt

your conversation or get involved with

you in any way but perfectly aware that

you're in the room he's just trying to

be as quiet and innocuous as possible I

immediately turn it I'm just like hey

you he looks up startled in your

direction yeah yes come here yes he

walks over and he says I'm to fit you

for a suit sir hmm well in this room we

doing that here I know any sort of

gestures nervously points a crooked old

finger toward the double doors he says

in your bedchamber set of course the

bedchamber that I'm completely aware of

like companions will be very comfortable

out here sir

do I get a suit he says she get a suit

I'm sure he sort of looks you up and

down the earth and says I believe we

could find something for you it may not

fit perfectly but we'll have to do okay

your bride is a lovely creature if I may

say so sir hmm looking forward to

finding that out what's her name Strix

will yell from under the desk I don't

rightly know

is she a human yes

is she a vampire I don't believe so no I

don't believe you

says shall we shall we press on sir

David was wasting mmm right I turn I

turn to my my party I'm just like all

right guys I have to go get fitted for

my suit now I'm sure everything we were

talking about you you got it it was good

to see you Paulton yes let's do that

just like an awkward like shake alright

so this old man goes to the double doors

and he stands by there his hit and he

sort of holds the bag of stuff in one

hand and pulls the doors open waits for

you to go through first and bow as you

do I go through the doors

[Music]

the old man closes the doors behind them

so evil Indies and Strix you are alone

with the suit of armor and the shadow

look they're having a wedding right no

we're leaving before that he's getting

married right why because you can't have

a wedding if there's no bride

I say we set the place on fire I like

that idea

let's get Paulson first and then let's

burn the thing down that's your answer

for everything how could I feel it hear

me out

if there's no bride there's nothing to

get married to and no this ritual

happens are you talking about killing

somebody else I'm just gonna say right

now that I'm glad that this morning

Carol it has to be silent no no the

mortal peril has made you nice and you

know it have initiative again good job

to you you're back the team I just saved

if there's no bride you can't go through

this right well what do you mean by no

bride just prevent it we'll stop it

that's all we got to do so we have to go

find the bride yeah we could just I mean

I don't see how that would stop it they

seem to feel like Brad's just come for a

dime a dozen they seem to be able to

find new ones all in time I don't know I

mean Strada was pretty set on having

that one bride so I think they're pretty

particular about these well the bride

probably doesn't want to be here so all

we have to do is just pick her up and

then take her out of here

no one wants to be here we kidnap her

okay well that sounds fine it's not

kidnapping it's just escorting it's

different but what about paulten we're

just gonna leave him with that guy

daughter now before oh come back for it

death will take his his belongings out

of a sack and simple real quick and pull

out tree bane and hand it to evylyn she

like happy and you can see like a

visible like relief coming over she has

had zero weapons zero items nothing

and she's like thank you and she gives

him a huge hug like a big metallic hug

and Strix will give her back juniper as

well oh I guess I still do have like a

pouch or something yeah yeah I don't

know

yeah maybe you might have a little

internal compartment that you could put

around like pop out of your shoulder in

your brain yeah okay

are you wearing my my winged boots oh

yeah I returned those to her too

you don't want to keep they're not for

me you never use them well that's too

bad it is too bad it would have been

funny thanks Trix well if you ever wanna

borrow you let me know I put them back

on

yep they sort of magically resize to fit

your little wooden feet okay well I feel

better I say we go find the bride all

right sounds good

right all right so there's the way you

came in the secret passage leading to

the staircase there's two single doors

leading out of the room as well one of

which you've taken before to sort of get

around the castle you could probably

take the familiar one and no you're not

gonna get lost

yeah that's that you're by its now

standing in the middle of the room okay

so we could probably it won't obstruct

our path right no if we move fast enough

you see that the the giant shadow on the

wall kind of shrinks back down to its

human form little less threatening I

don't understand why would it be doing

that I don't know either we need to get

out of here you little lead the way why

don't we why don't we ask I hate to say

this and I'm sorry do you boo we have no

I mean but she is a smart blood from

sickle they'll know everything about it

I don't want anything to do with that

who are we talking about oh that will

explain his new sword to evilly

that's so cool no it's not I don't trust

it you shouldn't they're really

dangerous but it's literally a weapon

that calls a cool animal friend to tell

you things about the world she's not an

animal friend we see the shadow produce

what seems to be a set of shadow

bagpipes oh come on no real literal

right now we're leaving we're leaving I

wait what does it have to say maybe it

won't maybe it does want him to play the

bagpipes it's not making any sound but

it looks like it's playing yes see I was

right all along it just wants balls it

to play I don't think that's what it

wants I don't think what it was then why

is it playing bagpipes because it wants

to be spooky I don't know okay I think

that's what shadows underestimate

Politan in his shadow yes for all we

know that's what palton is exactly doing

right now it is a shadow right he hasn't

played bagpipes in a long time if you

haven't noticed I doubt that's what he's

doing right now you said there's one

doorway that we are familiar with yeah

all right let's leave out that one

please let's go are you going to notify

the monger folks that you left outside

the other secret door just gonna let

them hang there I'll go and tell them

I'll be like hey we're gonna go we need

some air where's master Politan he's

getting fitted for your suit you're so

worried about you go stomping down the

stairs any moment something about gotta

prepare all right I'm sorry for it okay

and yes you go wandering off into the

into the castle to try to find the bride

I would all I'd like all three of you to

make investigations checks for me

[Applause]

well I got a five so okay

you quickly become disoriented by the

castle and its many dark passageways

staircases going up down you find

yourself going up and down to try to get

to where you need to go you can't quite

remember the way back down to the dining

hall and the ground floor or the organ

chamber or any of the other familiar

sites and at some point do you start to

realize that you know your scent your

sense of memory can't be this bad there

must be something weird going on in this

castle you just feel like you're being

led to strange places you've never been

before paltin you're in a comfortable

bed chamber a huge canopy bed with black

drapes go against one wall there is a

freestanding full-length mirror in a

corner there's other accoutrements a

standing candelabra with nine lit

candles burning away they go large

window dominates the wall but it's

covered with red velvet drapes

there are also drapes hanging what

appeared to be they might be privies or

closets vestibules that you can't see

and this old man is taking your

measurements as you're standing there

and asher enters the room through one of

the vestibules he just throws the

curtain aside and he comes out with your

suit

it lays it on the bed while the old man

is taking measurements and he refers to

the old man is Leif kind of impatiently

he doesn't seem to have much patience

for this doddering old fool at all but

sure sits there on the edge of the bed

his legs crossed and he's just sort of

like picking little bits of dirt and

lint and old stuff off the suit like

it's been packed away for ages and it's

the same kind of outdated almost archaic

design that he himself favors I look at

the suit I'm just like

and often the distance Politan you begin

to hear what sounds like bagpipes but it

sounds like they're outside the castle

like you'd hear you know on a Scottish

morning waking up in the highlands

somebody just playing in the hills that

kind of thing very distant I see

ask-ask Asher it's like what's that

what's what do you hear anything

well in fact I do sounds like music far

away kind of sad

I want to know who that is why why why

why

um I'm sorry um I'm sorry um okay so let

me let me go over let me go over this

arrangement again so why am I here you

are here mm-hmm

to take a bride aha to consummate your

marriage and why am I getting married

it's a symbolic gesture the bride

represents the dark powers you are

giving yourself over to them so they can

make you the new Dark Lord okay that's

what I was getting at so um

Dark Lord to be and you're questioning

why is that a good idea yeah he says the

master is waking the dead

you can't have a wedding without guests

it's like now was that so hard

I thought you had enough to worry about

I was only thinking of you hmm

so sweet I only ever think of you too

sweet

okay he says if it wasn't for bidden I'd

be all over you now hmm but that would

be improper the dark powers would not

like that is that so and but once you're

the Dark Lord you can do whatever you

want anything you want but you're going

to have to let your friends go you know

that it's the only way that they can be

safe you send them back to wherever they

came from

so if they stay here after this happens

they are that in danger well I don't

think they'll be happy do you hmm that's

a matter of perception and he says all

that power you'll have you're not likely

to regard them in the same way

your sentimentality will fade love will

become love of the living will become

less important to you

good to know

he says I know this because I've read

many of the books in the master study

and after he embraced his darkness he

was never the same and he was a great

man

what like so he was never the same after

no he was cold what was what was he like

before a great warrior so I'm told a

soldier he placed his family above all

if you were of the blood then you were

his to protects and he always kept his

word

Bevis thani packed his proof of that hmm

they saved his life he was indebted to

them forever that sounds familiar

he says forever will have new meaning

for you after tonight

I'm so scared

as you as is going on leaf his comes

over Gretch are just from thrush thrusts

the suit into his sunken chest and leaf

will go over and immediately sort of

take it over to a small vanity and begin

to do some stitching some tucking and

other things to the suit while you're

talking to Asher Asher sort of Pat's

the bed next to him I will have a seat

all right it's like I'm sure the music

continues to play distance sounds like a

piece you would choose hmm he says there

is some of you in the creature I call

the master

once you've embraced the dark powers he

will rejoin you and you will have in you

what I hope to be the best of him

whatever piece whatever fragment of him

he used to tear your shadow from you

that will be inside you that piece of

straw

he and I had a special relationship all

good to know what do I do

while you're thinking about that the

others of you you find yourself going up

a tower staircase and the tower is quite

broad it's about 60 feet across inside

and the staircase hugs the inside wall

and you get to a landing that has a door

leading outside an open archway onto

what appears to be a bridge that crosses

from this tower to another tower and you

see something hanging above you in

midair the spiral staircase continues up

the tower overhead and hanging in midair

above you is what appears to be a

10-foot diameter black heart it's the

heart we were supposed to destroy that I

thought Morgan was gonna do that he was

like drunk or something I don't know and

you can you can see that it looks like

at one point the heart may have been

kind of alive but it's all sort of

crystallized dead and it's got a gash in

it it looks dead to me it looks sort of

burnt out it's not it's not pulsing or

beating or no so he did destroy it for

us well that's good you can also see you

can also see on the stairs

sort of littering the stairs are bits of

shattered weaponry Hal birds that have

been broken or sundered or blasted to

pieces are there any good weapons

nothing has survived so at this point

you kind of have a choice you can either

cross the bridge to the other

roof of the other tower or you can keep

going up this one across the bridge or

you can go back down we don't even like

we couldn't even go back where we came

from right

you could you could crawl back down this

staircase and try to figure out where

you went wrong but we're like super lost

is what I mean you are smelling for lost

yes like we couldn't keep where the suit

of armor was and stuff you couldn't find

your way back there if you tried yeah

this is fine we can be lost they can't

start the wedding party so for a loss we

can't start without us

I don't know I think they'd start

without us in a heartbeat yeah it's nice

that you're logical but I heartbeat when

you sort of poke your heads out through

the archway and look the so the keep of

the loops the keep of the castle looks

like that oops wait there okay gotcha

and you see that tall tall spire yeah

you are up in that and there's a bridge

that crosses over to the flat-topped

high tower and you can see by the time

you get up here now a lot of the sky is

clear which is odd you didn't expect to

see that but there is a storm coming in

from one direction and you can see the

Sun has set behind the mountains in the

other I do not like this oh yeah there's

a storm coming alright I don't I think

it had I think the storm is like a

metaphorical storm I think everything

here means something bad yep and from

this vantage point when you look toward

the storm and then cast your eyes down

you can look down the high perch that

the castles on and see in a valley a

small familiar village it's pointed

rooftops and general layout conforming

to the village of Borough via the first

place you entered upon arriving here it

sits at the base of the spire on which

the castle is

perched you can see it clear as day so

nostalgic remember all of our times

together yeah it sucked the dark clouds

are kind of pressing up against it and

will soon be over the castle as well

since the sky is clear right now and

it's not stormy can it I like using my

boots jump out the window and kind of

get like a super vantage point on the

castle and look from yeah you can

essentially flutter around music I wanna

see if I see this Caravan that was

coming okay you can make a perception

check to see what you see and or hear

even as a robot is much more perceptive

16 yes you can sort of hear a distant

sound of bagpipes but you can't pinpoint

where it's coming from

it just seems to echo around the the

general area of the mountains where

you're in and it sounds very very faint

but as you look around you can see that

on the rooftops below you some old

decrepit gargoyles are perched you can

see empty battlements with no guards on

them curtain walls with parapets that

stand unguarded below you is the chapel

which seems lit from within and above it

belfry tower that currently appears dark

there's not much activity in the rear

courtyards you do see a small garden at

the base of the chapel that looks sort

of wild and untended and what appears to

be a walk out an overlook that allows

you to look down into the valley below

but toward the front of the castle where

the gatehouse is and the drawbridge you

can see there is strods black carriage

his coach with two black horses still

waiting outside the entrance to the

castle which is now closed up there's no

activity other than the horses around

the coach at present

and the drawbridge is down does seeing

the castle from this vantage point give

me any help on like us navigating inside

the castle not so much because the

castle inside is a maze but there are

windows and other things around here

where at least if you had an idea of

where you were going

you'd have a better chance of getting

there uh okay I go back and kind of like

report all this to my friends and it

also strikes you just being a person of

some religious background that if there

is a wedding and there is a bride

eventually she's going to be taken to

the chapel I mean that's that's the

ultimate destination for all of this

right so I do report all of this to my

friends and then I say if we want to

stop the wedding I think we just got to

set the chapel on fire

yay I mean will it burn anything burns

dude we could also smash it I don't know

is it made of stone or wouldn't smashing

a chapel kind of be like bad for you not

if it's an evil chapel in the possession

of the Dark Lord Himself yeah did you

guys hear you asked somewhere evylyn

with your perception check you can see

flying through the air toward the castle

and by extension toward you are what

appear to be three witches on brooms no

there they're coming from a direction

and heading toward the castle it's not

clear to you that they're bearing down

on you specifically they seem to be just

coming back to the castle looks like the

wedding guests are starting to arrive Oh

dip is hot hidden do you remember the

braum incident everything's coming back

we should go back inside all right well

can we go to the chapel

or you can try and make it you know what

I'm just gonna I'm just gonna turn D F

into a cloud so that he stops panicking

sounds slow you're not plowed so just

take a few deep breaths it'll turn you

back look up panky is a cloud

it's like wisps going everywhere he's

looking look at his arms they're going

crazy he's trying to yell at us you feel

better yet he does give me an OK or like

a peace sign or like okay I'm gonna

leave MacLeod for a while okay all right

maybe he needs to cool down yeah I think

so anyway

Asher says to you palton as he sort of

brushes your hair with his hand that you

could use a haircut but there's no time

okay can I pull some persuasion on him

sure okay what are you aiming to

persuade him to do um he seems game for

anything he's pretty bored right now

well I'm going to try and persuade him

to help figure out how this doesn't go

down okay he's like have you learned to

perform any tricks with that hand anyway

yes so so you're trying to get them on

your side basically yeah see things in a

new light

yeah and if this goes alright I have an

idea see so that is that is a net 20

what

so that totals to 28 so I'm hoping that

this okay I kind of didn't want that

role to go that well okay so after he

like brushes my hair off yes

I put my hand on the side of his face

and I leaned into him and I just rest my

forehead on his and I say the the dark

powers won't let this be will they

always get their way if only there were

some other way out of this and then

maybe this could actually happen you see

that he sort of becomes lost in your

eyes for a moment and then he says oh

you didn't hear it from me but if you

can rid the fragment of strut from your

shadow then all of your problems could

be solved I'm aware of a spell called

dispel evil and good this spell can do

it and then he sort of says dot if it

fails

and he hesitates to speak further on

that point hmm ask him what what does

this spell entail he tells you some of

the things that he's learned that it is

an Abbe duration effect and essentially

it creates a shimmering energy that

surrounds and protects you from Fae

undead and creatures originating from

other planes like fiends and things and

so they they have a hard time attacking

you and that kind of thing it's

protective but you can then discharge

the spell and cause it to dismiss a

celestial an elemental if a a fiend or

an undead that you come into contact

with that you touch and if you do and if

it succeeds that creature is banished

away and since your shadow is got strong

basically in it or a fragment of it you

would essentially banish that fragment

and it would have nowhere really to go

except into oblivion I sure I said he

tells you that the only thing keeping

your shadow from rejoining you is the

fragment of straud inside because it's

not time you're not on the side of the

dark powers yet I asked him say would

you do that for me

I can't cast that spell

but there is someone who can and who's

that the abbot's presiding over your

wedding the father of the bride

now you recall having met the abbot in

the abbey of st. markovia you recall

having met his construct the beautiful

flesh golem Basilica

you recall evylyn back when she was

flesh and blood

using her divine sense on the abbot and

detecting that he was a celestial

but celestial who for whatever reason

was in league with straud

huh he said Ascher says I can smell

somewhere deep down in that rotten form

of his a lingering goodness that wants

to get out

it wants to do the right thing he sort

of says that was some disgust where he

says but the abbath is not the human he

pretends to be something much more

powerful

uh-huh the art powers have a great

interest in him as well they could have

made him the Dark Lord if not you

except for that lingering goodness in

him

and if only you had a way to compel him

uh-huh

where uh where where is this this feller

well he arrived with the bride I assume

he's overseeing final preparations in

the chapel

if I may I'd like to maybe have a word

with him before he says I think that can

be arranged

I say he'll stand up and sort of extend

his hand to us to take yours I take his

an all right unless you have somewhere

else you'd like him to take you right

now he will take you downstairs as by

the most direct route to the chapel uh

yeah I think I think I just want to talk

to this guy okay

uh sure will command leaf to have the

suit ready by the time they return that

seems to throw there's a veiled threat

involved and leaf becomes very pale and

nervously goes back to finishing his

hemming and hawing and the other three

of you even did you want to rejoin your

friends or do you want to kind of stay

airborne yeah okay and you told them

about hey let's burn down the chapel

yeah all right the three of you can see

maybe a witch's sort of fly down toward

the castle they kind of fall a little

bit out of view it almost looks like

they're gonna collide with one of the

towers they sort of descend so sharply

but they kind of pull up at the last

moment and tap on one of the windows of

one of the towers and the window is open

for them

I look at death and I'm like do you have

some also previous relationship with

these witches or is it just the broom

saying we'll just make him not a cloud

she'll be like calm down mister

you're not allowed anymore okay good

it's mostly the broom thing you'll be

fine the brooms don't worry I hate this

place I don't want to be anywhere sorry

we'll get out of here as soon as we can

okay they all hated this place you are

the one who wanted to stop the wedding I

just want to take part in and leave

let's go down and stop the wedding we

need to do that so let's go to the

chapel whatever we have to do if we have

to set traps if we have to make a scene

if one of us has to carry waffles can

you carry waffles like waffles okay I I

hadn't even really she's made the

harness anymore she's walking on her own

she's too big yeah too big the carriage

uh she is a little awkward to carry now

yeah so she's got a she's got a gentle

leader basically a leash yeah I actually

hadn't said hi officially two waffles

I'd kind of been holding back because

the ebloom is afraid that now that she's

a robot that waffles wouldn't love her

anymore so as soon as Strix is like you

hold waffles even kind of like gets down

on one knee and kind of like holds out

her hand to waffles to see if yea

waffles

comes right over to you and just sort of

wraps her big hairy paws around you

would shed a tear if she could that she

makes a whirring noise makes whatever

kissing noises she can but it's more

like a clicking sound yeah yeah awfully

she'll kind of like attach it to like a

you know some sort of ring on her side

or something like that she doesn't even

have to hold it yeah there is the chapel

in the back with the yellow windows and

there's some high windows up in the dome

of the chapel and then some ones that

are closer down to what you assume to be

the the main level of the chapel as you

peered down at them some of the windows

have cracks and gaps in them so there is

a way to actually get into the chapel if

you can descend safely which I assume

you can fly evylyn you would gaseous

deaath and strikes can manage

so did you want to try to get to the

chapel I assume you think it would be

easier to get to the chapel from outside

the structure where you're not confused

and then bottled by its labyrinthine

yeah yeah also I keep my eye out for

anything that we could use as an

accelerant okay you don't see anything

like that we could go back down into the

castle to some rooms with well you

didn't find a wine cellar or anything

like that but there you did see some oil

lamps on hallway walls and some

tapestries and dried out tapestries and

stuff you could go back down into the

structure and try to find those again

strips don't worry it'll be fine and

fireball when we find Strix those

hanging fireball or two okay or seven so

what are you using to get down to the

chapel I will cloudy up again but only

as he starts to talk to me all dismissed

all misty step down to the top of it

oh so you're basically mrs. set down to

the roof yeah like Laurel Lake however

to get there like got it okay so you

could probably with a couple misty steps

get to a window floats down very slowly

like this so as you guys float down to

some of the high windows of the chapel

and peer through when you look inside

you can see that there are all kinds of

candles lit all over the place the whole

interiors at every candle in Castle

Ravenloft and possibly burrow via has

been brought here for the singular

purpose and set a flame so the whole

place is lit up with candles and

candelabras the chapel is one big giant

room with pews on the lowest level and

you can see more of these sort of straw

hatted witches moving the pews around to

straighten them out because they were

all in disarray before and their brooms

are moving around on their own accord

sweeping the floor taking all the dust

bunnies away and so they're busying

themselves with that you can see a

figure that you recognize as the abbot

standing up by the altar and he's kind

of by himself kind of Reese

the altar which was slightly crooked

it's an immensely heavy thing but he

doesn't seem to have too much trouble

doing it on his own and at the same time

he's doing that he's talking in low

tones to a ghastly emaciated figure

dressed like a tattered peasant with

tangled hair that you recognize as the

young lad who was trapped in the cellar

of the village church literally yeah so

yeah you see this this emaciated young

man Doru

standing there and he's wearing a

tattered altar boy robe and is basically

just sort of nodding with his bloodshot

eyes at whatever the priest says and

he's holding a like almost like a

standard it's a spear pole with a crest

at the top of it that makes it like the

crest of Ravenloft in addition to the

main floor overlooking the chapel closer

to your height is a balcony with a

slightly protruding part that has two

Thrones currently all you see on the

balcony are two zombie guards standing

next to a set of double doors that lead

deeper into the castle they're dressed

in tattered castle livery but they're so

horrifically aged that their skin is

sort of dry and taut on their bones and

everything about them is just on the

verge of looking like they're about to

fall apart and they've got just vacuous

stares they're not aware of pretty much

anything okay hear me out

what if waffles is the ring bearer

[Music]

be awesome and that even so then you see

Asher and paltin enter the chapel on the

ground floor they come through a big set

of double doors it's potent looking fly

he is looking exactly like he did before

he's still in his Raven get up yeah so

you're looking very fly and then he and

Asher are holding hands and yes and they

make their way down the aisle as though

in an instant it's almost like they're

the ones getting even looks like it's

like oh and paulten as you enter you can

see this grand chapel is lit with

candles there are witches and pointy

hats basically pointing as their brooms

are sweeping the floor

they've straightened everything out but

the place is still kind of got bits of

refuse and dust some of the witches have

armfuls of shattered wood and pieces of

glass in their arms and things like that

and then on ahead of you on the dais is

this black draped altar with the abbot

dressed in his red and gold robes a

blazing sun image on his back and he is

having a conversation with a familiar

vampire spawn who eluded you at the

start of the campaign and as soon as

that as soon as you walk in hand-in-hand

with Usher that vampire spawn recognizes

you incidentally it just stares with

fearful bloodshot eyes

the abbot turns over his shoulder his

tall or his his sort of ornate hat and

habit obscuring parts of his face but

can't hide his otherworldly beauty and

do I see the rest of the party or there

no okay

he's there holding hands with Asher

Tweetup boy okay they'll hear you say to

blow

I uh I like leaned over - sure

just like that one right yeah you he

points toward the abbot's you can see

that the abbot has around his neck a

symbol of the morning Lord a holy symbol

antiquated compared to evil ins but you

recognize the symbol right away huh yeah

and usher usher will present you to him

he'll say Lord Paulson this is the abbot

of st. Marko vayas Abbey

and the abbot will extend a hand to you

and say we've met mm-hmm quite you see

he's got a sort of a ruby ring on one of

his long fingers that he holds out

expecting you to take it and kiss it

will do such that all right so you are

now in direct contact with the abbot

understanding before this black altar

evoke I respond sort of with his little

crest he sort of moves so the abbot

eclipses him some ways worse and the

abbot says I trust you have prepared

your vows my son

um preparing something for sure I asked

him could we have a word maybe in

private of course

and he just waves like very dismissively

waves Asher away and Asher will bow

before the abbot and then he'll give you

a smile and he'll back off and then

Richard basically withdraw from the

chapel I gave that sure a little wink

like on his way out he's grateful mmm

Evelyn's like you know she's like kind

of tapping like waiting for them and

when she sees the wink it's like the

tapping just intense yeah and then Asher

sort of makes a soundless

and in walks walks quite confidently

back out of the chapel the three of you

observing from above I'd like you all to

make perception checks if you notice

something amiss all right D F you're the

only one to notice that another figure

has entered the scene but is trying to

do so discreetly and it's on the upper

balcony so it's actually closer to you

than anything else but is clinging to

the shadows because there's not much

light on the balcony all the light is

coming from below essentially and so the

balcony itself is casting a long shadow

up the walls you could only see the two

zombies basically has the little

pinpoints of red light in their eyes and

their dark odd ominous eerie shapes but

the figure who has come up the staircase

the balcony staircase and is just kind

of lingering and kind of eavesdropping

on the conversation below is a kind of

horrifying looking man big belt brawny

bald for the most part but one of his

arms is unnaturally bigger

I recognized as Strix is half brother is

extraña what a guest list damn and just

by his posture and where he is you're

not sure that he's supposed to be here

but he is present nonetheless do I see

that or just do you see that

IDF sees that but it's up to death

whether or not he wants to share that

turns over districts and even at that

point the troop you can see where he's

casting his smoky fingers and when you

look on the balcony yes you can see the

dark shape of eASIC I put my arm in

front of Strix and like still just

turned paler than she already is just

like all the blood from her face I hold

up like a tree bane and I kind of like

look questioning that or like also

she'll make D if not a clouded oh my god

all right d f you are solid palton what

do you say to the abbot if anything ok

so so I remember what was the blows the

spell called dispel evil and good so I

say to him I asked what he what he knows

about that he tells you it's very

powerful magic it's a magic of the magic

of the true gods but you know

it's nothing more nothing less

aha he doesn't seem to have any sort of

weird mysticism about it okay yeah yeah

that spell exists and you know people

cast it and good stuff say and that's

something that's something you might

know yeah hmm interesting okay so he

says I sense that you have some

misgivings about this ritual that we are

about to begin

please don't it's all for the best of

the realm I assure you I just say like

is that is that how you really feel

about all this you are the only one who

can save Peruvian now you are the future

of this land without everyone here will

die No ah that does sound less than

ideal he says to embrace the dark power

this is not a bad thing I'm just like

dark okay

he says it is a way to bring order

like so if this ceremony doesn't happen

everyone dies and that's it there's no

there's nothing else

he says I'm not sure I follow what other

thing would you want to happen I don't

know it wasn't exactly when was your

life taking you before you were brought

here my son what true calling would draw

you away from this place well although I

don't want an entire lands worth of

people to die there are people that I

don't think that I'd want to say goodbye

to so soon door ooh the young boy behind

you the vampire teen basically says

we're all dead already

look at the kid I'm like damn dude dark

there's no one left to save

so you

look back up at yeah but I'm like anyway

make a perception check balton okay that

is a 19 you see your friends way up high

perched on looking through a window down

at you 60 feet above as you cast your

eyes furtively about the chapel how far

are they about 60 feet up is my hands

still with me right yes and as I think

for all's around doors like what the

hell was that I was like oh he's he's

fine don't worry about him no no could I

like subtly get the hand to go is there

a way for him to get up there the hand

there are staircases on the ground floor

that lead up to the balcony that

overhangs the chapel and then from there

you could probably climb up some

tapestries and things to try to get up

onto ledges near the hand there is a

path that you could trace up the walls

now I'm just wondering what it could

even do up there um yeah let's I guess

huh they can do things that a

disembodied hand can point way yeah give

him the finger whatever situation yes

true one of the witches says the guests

are coming

and she hastens she grabs hold of her

animated broom and hastens out of the

room one of them says you go check on

Cyrus make sure the food is ready

you make sure the bride has everything

she needs

tell the bridesmaids to prepare The

Witches get all into a tizzy the average

just smiles at them that's weird

bridesmaids could I uh try suggestion on

him you could do cast a suggestion spell

on him yeah okay yes so you cast the

spell

what suggestion are you going to I'm

gonna I'm gonna tell him I'm gonna be

like look like there's got to be a way

that I'm just not aware of that this can

work out cuz I know it's like I feel

like I feel like you you're not stoked

about this and I'm not stoked about this

I feel like there's there's a way out of

this and I think you can help me all

right and you cast the spell you see the

spell washes over him harmlessly doesn't

seem to affect him at all and he you see

his countenance turned very very dark

and he says you're wrong

ah you see materializing in his hand is

a golden mace

I'm sorry like whoa whoa whoa dude whoa

now it's it's very ornate at the top of

it it almost could double like some sort

of holy scepter you see his eyes blazed

with unnatural light Xerxes like the

world what

Oh drinks like don't thank you

first give you a piece of jerky you seen

what big feathered wings kind of come

out behind him and they're black huh and

he says you will do as the dark powers

command you will take a bride will sit

on the throne of Castle Ravenloft and

you will fulfill your function is Dark

Lord to these people is that clear is

that clear crystal and that's where

we'll stop for tonight there's a lot of

worried going on

I never thought I'm mm-hmm

there's brooms in here just wait wait

most of the most of the witches have

left by the time by the time the the

Davis started to show his davidís they

were like it we're out of here so
