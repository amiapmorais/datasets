hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action

what I miss I am so glad you asked so

carry on bring everybody up to speed in

burrow via evil and received the

blessing of Saint markovia a champion of

the morning Lord who perished battling

strawed also in burrow via paulsen

threatened the vampire hunter Rudolf van

rycke ttan with death should he ever

show his face again al turns out he did

in the company of a group of mourning

Lord

devotees that he persuaded the waffle

crew to kill at the vampires hunter at

the vampire hunters urging a they slew

these devotees in order to save a demon

blooded bard named Lilith Lucina Lilith

told the waffle crew about the soul

monger whose death curse has taken hold

of Strix and DF causing them to waste

away because they've both died did he

tell us the details of that curse like

what it when it all includes not so much

but you'll get some of those details but

Van Rycke tan did tell evylyn that she

alone can save her friends because she

carries this blessing of st. mark obeah

and mark st. mark cobia is this being a

protection and life and at which point

evil and ask the obvious question what

do I have to do and that Rickon replied

you have to die and that's where we

ended for the day I think yeah and then

Ana had the host for two days only just

lemming over then Ana had to conduct an

interview immediately after where's

Chris

and just not throw them over the edge no

it was actually awesome just as a side

note stream of annihilation was so cool

and although I'm terrified for evylyn

safety I'm also super inspired as a

player and the whole event was amazing

so yeah yay so in the privacy of your

suite which is located in this

underground in you have basically a

central room and then your own personal

bed chambers radiating off of it

in the privacy of this domain of Van

Rycke ttan tells you that the ritual he

intends to cast is an old vez thani

pagan ritual and that uh he needs to

gather some components oh not again so

he is going to try to take care of that

himself because he knows that you you

you're supposed to have an audience with

the Dwarven king so he wants to get a

jump on that the only thing he tells you

right off the bat is that he has to have

three rings of pure gold fashioned for

the ritual one for you evylyn one for

UDF and one for you Strix he also

mentions that since the three of you

will be tied up in the ritual that he

needs or he asks you guys to convince

paltin who's still sleeping off his

hangover uh if he will participate in

the ritual and dress up as a raven and

he also asks for help in assembling a

raven costume so even it is kneeling on

the floor cradling Strix in one arm and

death and the other arm and Van Rycke

turns just kind of been like he said you

have to die and then he's launched into

like all these logistics yes of how how

she's gonna die so she kinda is like at

first she's she just looks at him like

are you crazy but as he starts talking

you can see she kind of glazes over and

this look of like acceptance

kind of comes over her and she kind of

rolls her shoulders back and kind of is

nodding and nodding and she's she asks

you mentioned you mentioned 30 days is

there is there anything else we should

know about the timeline of this ritual

he said he tells you that he aims to get

the components together as quickly as

possible and to perform the ritual as

soon as possible because DF & Strix are

going to continue to deteriorate will

that break the curse for everyone or

just for them so he doesn't know whether

or not it will break the curse

it may stave off the curse essentially

it's it's a protection from the curse

but he doesn't know if the protection

will last forever

I don't trust Abi's barmy something

inside me tells me that he's he's right

he has pulled out a little frayed a tiny

little prayer book that he carries

around in one of the leather pockets of

his jacket it appears to have the symbol

of the morning Lord burned into it and

he starts flipping through pages as

you're talking back and forth and he

seems like he's looking for a prayer or

something

why would someone cast this curse just

on deaath & Strix why would someone do

this he doesn't have an answer for you

then how do you know so much about it um

he uh doesn't explain that either other

than to say and he is a doctor and he

can diagnose just by looking at the two

of them the the crippling nature of

their condition ie healing spells aren't

going to help so as far as evylyn knows

is just something that's happening to

Strix and des and not connected to

anything else in the world well you do

know lilith the demon blooded bard

you that there's this being called the

soul monger doing this that suggests

that there are other people affected

otherwise how would she know and so I

guess I'm trying to get it as does

evylyn grass that everyone who has died

is now and been resurrected is now dying

again no okay she does not know okay um

you do know that it's affecting people

like that which is why you're you

haven't been affected gotcha okay even

just kind of nods alright so uh we need

to we need to make a raven costume yes

that's one of the things he says that he

needs as part of this ritual the raven

being a symbol of a creature that bears

souls to safety strikes will kind of

look down at our robes and be like full

day's work then written things they

might work for the robes but it's

probably gonna take more than that

our eye shows he shows you um uh some

old scrolls in a sort of a roped up

bundle Strix and they're all crumpled

and gnarled and stained from aged very

badly taken care of them something have

little burn marks in the corners like

they've been through flame I've been

pulled out of fire when you look at one

he shows you a very crude almost

childlike picture of what he had in mind

and it's this little sort of walking

bipedal Raven head guy with like

feathers hanging from his arms got it

straight strikes is like oh it's so cute

step very sort of primitive you also see

a picture of a figure clad in a pointed

hood and a long dark road uh and and

signs around him indicating some sort of

clerical figure all right

much much more ominous Oh misterx is is

she can help with my costume she'll tell

him okay at least the best best she can

but alright how are they feeling cuz I

was like they had collapsed and I was

holding them

kind of like so our crippled artery

right now so right now uh your maximum

hit points have dropped by one and so

whatever your maximum is it is now one

lower and and been written says the

deterioration will continue until you no

longer can survive but they um they're

able to like move around and all that

they're yeah they're they're sort of um

a little bit physically ill but once

they overcome that or start to sort of

live with that they can get around okay

they just look really really sick I'm

I'm holding them really tight so they

want to get up out of my arms they they

have to like not like my kind of like

stroking strix is little shoulder and

like holding das real tight I'm just

like hold I'm holding them to them

really really tight so palton when you

wake up you wake up to the sound of

their voices in the common room and

you're in your bedchamber and you've

been you just sort of woken up sober and

you hear among your friends voices it

familiar it's oh my god

eerie voice of one dr. Rudolph man

ricktum do I like instantly recognize

it's who it is yes light on sight unseen

you recognize it um I do I have a

relative Reid of like the layout outside

the room like where they'd be yeah but

the common room is about a thirty foot

diameter square with a big open hearth

and the door leading to a hallway

connected to the in proper so there's a

your bedchamber is like a 10 foot by 10

foot room with a stone bed covered with

a mattress so when you open the door

when you pull up in door the bedchamber

you'll be basically looking into 30-foot

square common room okay um

I'm gonna open the door quietly and peek

out okay you can see Van Rycke Dhin is

standing not too far from the fire with

what appears to be he's flipping through

a little tiny book and reciting part of

a sort of mumbling to himself while the

rest of the party and occasionally like

evil and we'll ask him a question or

whatnot or they seem to be talking about

some sort of costume and trying to

figure out where they're gonna get a

bunch of like Raven feathers okay sand

you said he's standing currently he is

standing not too far away from a padded

chair uh

[Music]

across which you can see his cane is

resting and his bag sort of is sitting

on the floor near that chair as well

okay um can i it's a little stretch but

can I cast animate object onto the chair

sure and would I be able to have the

chair like scoot under him so it knocks

him into it and then like I have the

arms like Beauty and the Beast I'll like

just like grab a sense sort of smother

him in the chair a little bit yeah just

like uh yeah sure um so you begin to

cast the spell its thermal and somatic

components so as you cast the spell your

friends can hear you cast it but the

spell will be cast before they can do

anything as you have surprised all right

um

yeah you can totally do that and it's a

chair suddenly springs to life and is

under your control and immediately tries

to scooch underneath the elderly doctor

I'm just going to make Xterra tea saving

throw for him okay he rolled a natural

one so yes the chair Galatz

over the doctor falls back into it and

then the arms of the chair just kind of

come up and grab over him and the rest

of you see this horrifying sight of the

stuffed chair

springing to life charging the doctor

taking him into its folds and then

trapping him you want to do anything

else paltin now I'm gonna mosey my way

out there okay at this point the doctors

let out a Yelp of panic because he isn't

it what the heck's going on aah

evylyn jumps to her feet as if to help

but then sees holding them both by the

way very strong as if to help but then

sees paulten coming and kind of like

just holds and looks between the two of

them all right oh yeah so paulten you

have trapped the good doctor in your

chair cool I'm gonna walk out there and

I'm gonna stay hey what's going on uh

yeah the doctor replies we don't have

time for this wasn't asking you I'm

asking asking the others oh oh we're oh

hi hi Paulson okay like as he talks can

I get the chair to like do another arm

just like just covered yeah he's like

not talking to you hmm

yeah okay so who's gonna explain well

it's it's really not a big deal she

don't have to worry it's totally fine

just even and I mean uh dfn Strix are

kind of they're not doing very well and

I kind of point to Strix is burned skin

and yes like rope bruised neck and I am

like there seems to be curse been

written says he knows how to break it he

was telling us how and isn't it nice

just to see him again huh

also evil it has to die and it's this

I'm not gonna let her die

it's she's delirious I'm not that

worried if she's feeling very ill I kind

of covered her face and why are we

listening to him because he's the only

one that knows how to stop these two

from wasting away those who I mean I

guess is him but I believe in great

premise right no excuse me dress is a

little bird it's a Strix it's very fun

it's all I can do man to do anything

just dirty burn there's like at least 12

decisions relating to this guy I'm gonna

make before I decide if I'm wearing a

bird costume we're gonna go ahead and

put a pin in that no don't do that I'm

gonna I'm gonna have the chair like just

take the hand off his mouth so you can

talk okay uh he doesn't actually say

anything at that point because he's

afraid that you might do something else

to him with the chair so he just stares

at you a side eye off the off the top of

his pink tinted spectacles hi turned to

palton and I'm like if you if you need

to know that he's telling the truth I

could cast his own a truth for you while

you talk to him no no I got I got better

ideas to get the truth out of him you

always do I'm gonna like just kind of

like kneel down in front of them just

super douchey condescendingly

it's like what did I say uh he says if I

recall the conversation you said he

would kill me the next time we met

mm-hmm I was hoping to stay it off my

demise until I could save your friends

it's a good game you play so why what

why why you why are you the one aside

from the fact that it makes for pretty

riveting plot he says I am among other

things I'm practicing cleric and I know

curses I have a power to remove many of

them you see but not this one

not in the traditional way you have to

delve into all or call upon ancient

prayers there's not used the days of the

pagan cults of the Ballon Ock that's a

lot of words he says suffice to say your

friend

evylyn has been gifted by one of the

great saints of the morning Lord

mokou via her power resides in your

friend I can sense it I can plan to you

Mike obvious blessing to protect EF and

Strix from the hell magic that consumed

em can I uh Casey if I feel like he's

telling the truth yes you can make an

inside check okay uh fourteen uh you you

sense that he you sense an honesty about

him you also sense reticence to divulge

all of the information ah he seems to be

holding something back from you you

think I tell them and and you need to

dress up as a giant bird Paul said I

have some art for tea for you she like

ripped up my chunk of her robe and like

throw it at him like I'm sorry what was

that last thing

says ready burn i evil is just like

trying to put strikes against her chest

like he says Ravens have great power

uh-huh

so in matters of the Dead so if I look

like a rate if I look like something

that has power then that's good enough

he says all of the components of the

ritual are symbolic in some way rings

the costume binary words okay and why am

i the raven he says because of your

heritage as I said these are mastani

pagan ritual hmm and you matter warmer

surface Lonnie blood Ravens are pretty

cool I knew one once she's nice naked a

lot but nice yeah you sat on him that's

a good way to put it

[Laughter]

so um right okay so this this whole this

little like Raven Party thing sounds

cool and all but uh let's let's go back

to the the first conversation where you

die eh why why why should i why should I

listen to you why should I let you go

again why should I let you do your your

weird vampire voodoo and we're just like

yeah sure that sounds fun he says in

response

decision as yours kill me if you must

okhta para mic guys I really want to

kill him

I mean I want you to have everything in

the whole world that you want but I'm

I'm just wanting to make sure that Strix

and Diaz are okay I kind of show it both

of them to him so the only option is for

you to die or they die is that is that

what it comes down to I mean that's what

we were kind of trying to work out was

dying I mean but I think we should at

least listen to what vain written has to

say it's much like last time he tells

you that if he performs the ritual it

will essentially transfer the blessings

of markovia from Evelyn to her friends

but that ritual comes with a price and

there is a sacrificial component to the

ritual like many rituals there's a

sacrifice and essentially releasing that

energy out of evil and will earn her up

I kind of look at all of them and I say

I've known since I was a little girl

that this moment would come

it's okay I'm glad that it came with you

no nope no nope nope like what's what's

option B what's the option where no one

dies except you but none of us well I

mean I have the elders I have this

blessing and I can remove curses I mean

I could try that

you just wait hold on I miss that they

just shrug at me yeah he did in the face

oh okay he has that look of like oh I

should think that that's bad but she

thinks it's very exciting

he glasses that he repaired last week

gets sort of pop no pop askew and one of

the lenses pops out and falls into the

folds of the chair and blood begins

forced down his mouth ah as it does he

sort of licks his lips tastes his own

blood yeah again I am for the first time

in a while

and just sort of kind of slumps in the

chair for an instant and you can see

already because he's a pretty old man

bruisin start to form around his eyes

where you hit him this guy's so messed

up just really quick just for the sake

of it even just quietly like remove

curse on Strix just like tries it really

quick

yeah you can cast the spell on Strix to

no effect alright well that doesn't work

I tried it though are you still holding

strict I said I'm holding the both in

fact cuz I just I was on the floor that

I stood up and was hauling them so I'm

not tall enough to have you guys

dangling but you're probably awkwardly

like oh yeah well Strix is trying to

bite you now death is like almost a foot

taller than you so he's just like she

lets go of Strix and then like just kind

of holds tight to death just not even

like holding you up anymore just kind of

like bleeding on you okay so just

scott'll into a corner so after after I

clocked that in the face just just

for the record you know you did three

points of damage to him you're with a

puncher do one plus your strength bonus

so you did great cool now I'm gonna ask

you one more time what are other options

where no one dies I know of none who do

you know that could know he says I am

very old all of my contacts are dead I

am alone everytime fan Rick did talks I

get sad

is there none other blessed by markovia

whoever it was that cave D is ate some

of her that's different

[Laughter]

uh yeah van Rycke can we'll look you

right in the eye paltin and say somewhat

menacingly I am the only one even sees

this tension and kind of like slowly

let's go Diaz and walks over like not

threatening Lee gets in between not even

in between but like stand next stands

next to Van Rycke tin and kind of like

gently strokes his face and lays on

hands just like a hit pointer to okay I

kind of just like fixed his face up a

little bit and she's like my friends I I

know this is hard but this is my

glorious mission it's beautiful if you

think about it I think it'll be all

right

I think we need to do what he says once

you ask but hander if it's gonna be all

right okay he says it'll be all right

you didn't ask him I did in my head you

didn't what are you asking palton you

can see underneath the sort of ruffled

shirt that van Rycke and wears which is

so old it's kind of gone from white to

yellow you can see there is a chain

around his neck you can't see what's

hanging from it because inside his shirt

but you do notice it first time up close

you am i interested in that i catches

your eye momentarily I'm just gonna like

grab it and like pull it out of his

shirt and just look at it okay you see

it is a holy symbol of the morning Lord

but an ancient see evil and use that use

that thing ask by hand or with that

thing

strikes the point at it well sander in

the light of the morning Lord everything

will always be alright I don't even have

to ask as you go dear morning Lord Lord

of glory and of light who shines down

upon us in your great Majesty and

sometimes asks your servants to make

great sacrifices in the name of your

holy /

Epis will everything be alright Chris do

I feel any answer inside check no I I

roll an inside check I get a five so I

feel nothing nothing paltin as she's

talking and you're sort of holding the

holy Simone's kind of a bit of a look at

it the fire the fire light in your heart

kind of shines off of it with a golden

light and it sort of flashes across your

face as it does um you see that or an

instant

it looks like the shadow of van ricktum

and his chair in light kind of waivers

and flickers a little bit uh almost like

uh um they're not entirely in sync with

this one mm-hmm

and what you read from that is like it's

it's almost unnatural advantage Dennis

in this world you can sense that all of

a sudden so I noticed that and I'm gonna

well look back at him like what are you

doing here he says after the mists

surrounding Moreau

yeah parted many people attempted to

leave among them some worshippers of the

Sun God but they were corrupt you see

they were driven by dream that would

lead them for evil acts and I have to

stop them so I followed them here I did

not know mu you night had I known here I

wouldn't have come but I'm running Lord

has guided me to you this reason that is

what I surmise is my purpose here

timing mean nothing else even kind of a

like nods and silently crosses herself

in the sign of the morning Lord he says

I sense that when my task is done here

so will my purpose I will leave it one

way or the other and am I kind of

picking up that he at this point really

is the only option um you're picking up

that he thinks he's the only option and

he thinks that it's the morning the Lord

has guided him back to evylyn to tell

her this this is how he Goods yeah yeah

he finds someone to be the only one an

important that's how he sticks around

son of a tricks is in the corner

now putting together a costume for palta

you're already doing stuff he's making

like a little wing and like slightly has

some handfuls of red feathers that she's

collected yeah probably

and she go I was a dance she's like she

just wanted to do a craft even even like

at whenever she's not talking you can

see that she's kind of like slowly

listing over to lean on one of her

friends or like touch one of her friends

so she like she was next to paltin so as

he's talking to van Rycke and she kind

of leaves his side and like goes and

just like she doesn't even try to take

his hand or anything she just like

stands really close to him like leans or

shoulder on him and like this as as you

do that the last thing van vecten says

to palton is in the dawn UT rains and

the way is clear and you evil and

recognize that as a old lysander prayer

she just nods and says amen

Paulding just kinda just and then I just

command the chair to just kind of slowly

tip back and do not want it all right

yeah he goes over with the chair and his

boots are sort of sticking up in the air

now his cane goes rolling across the

floor and then I just I'll release the

spell on the chair okay and he sort of

goes tumbling off the back of the chair

onto the floor all right so that's

settled we need a Raven costume and fold

it up I'm already there I already did it

oh that's so nice how does it look um

make a uh make a uh oh jeez um uh I get

Arcana performance I don't ah women see

let's say this is this is an artistic

pursuit let's say performance okay I

have nothing in that but I have a good

charisma modifier so uh you can use

intelligence performance so use your

intelligence one of mine doesn't it is

really come on uh five okay have it sort

of falls apart yes she was so sick she

forgot to put the pins in it or

something

Oh a bunch of feathers just sort of

spill onto the floor van Rycke Tesoro

stands up dusts himself off a little bit

and looks over at the travesty that

strix has wrought and something's

falling apart

yeah and says we have time no way I'm

gonna last thing I'm gonna say to them

I'm just gonna kind of grab buy a shirt

and just like pull them in I'm just like

all up in his yeah I'm just like I

want you to know regardless of this

outcome doesn't change if

it only changes how and all you've done

is given me more time to think about

that hope you're looking forward to it

buddy I just throw them off

okay he's teetering back and I he then

says absolutely best and I went and

secured the other components sounds good

he looks around for his broken

spectacles finds them casts another

mending spell to fix them again and sets

them on his nose as best he can before

hurrying out grabbing his jacket on the

way and his cane sorry we always punch

you

I'm not during all of this death is

noticeably objection with at some point

uh the body got that Worman bodyguards

return to your suite to see if you are

ready to speak to King Hart off sure Oh

since evil is standing right next to

paulten she kind of like puts her arm in

his arm like links arms like come on we

have to go see the king come on come on

all right let's follow you Boleyn okay

so the waffle crew this time nothing

interrupts their journey to the king's

throne hall oh good you can see even

kind of like looking around her intently

like you can see that she's really

appreciating her surroundings and she

has kind of like a a quiet smile on her

face she's just kind of like looking

around at everything as though she she

won't get to look at it very much longer

as she does that Strix is like are you

looking for a way out to know if we and

she let's go up Alton and she grabs on

to Strix no she doesn't like oh she

keeps her arm like they're linked arms

now and she's like no we don't have to

go anywhere because everything we love

is right here uh-oh

a but I would really like to go soon

soon

oh when you enter the throne Hall other

while there are some the the Dwarven

guards heavily armored standing outside

the throne Hall doors there are no

guards in the throne hall as you saw

last time when all the chaos happened

here but across the far side of throne

Hall you do see the king slumped in his

throne looking tragically bored and

surrounded by his advisors including the

sort of dark-skinned orange haired

senior advisor Azon bronze fire who's

very very old and leans heavily on a

stone short stone cane and as you

approach your footsteps or fluttering

moots echo and bounce off the walls back

to you making your approach seem much

louder than it actually is and you come

toward the throne before the king and he

asks you how goes your mission to iron

slag it went so well so well idea till

the Great King out went uh why did he

land deaath kind of snaps to and looks

over to evil in for a second just ah did

we quickly found that the fire Giants

were creating some kind of monstrous

constructs untold meters high that could

have easily devastated everything around

them fueled by an adamantine heart

forged by a fire primordial there's a

lot of dwarven murmuring at this point

around the throne the king says you

saved the life of one of our heroes

Gasper dimmer Kasim he said there were

other dwarves there did you find any of

them yeah

yes yes takes a pause and kind of

swallows to himself and says Jesper was

the only one we could save and there's

like a like averting his gaze elsewhere

right all right uh the king nods thanks

you for the information and promises to

reward you three days in three days is

that like a doorman custom thing cuz I

mean nothing we're in a super hurry but

just like who knows where we could be in

three days you know where any of us

could be or not be anywhere

he says come back three days at which

point a zon bronze fire accepts for it

says I demand to know what has become my

bodyguard crack well I'm glad you

brought that up pays on because I think

myself everyone else here especially the

King would love to know why you're

conspiring against him oh my god uh you

see uh more loud murmuring Azon eyes

wide taken aback almost loses actually

probably Rob's his cane at that point is

a punk punk punk on the floor a heavy

stone the dwarf King sort of shoots you

a gaze that's almost not sure what the

dwarf King is thinking in that moment

just for like extra Flair right as DF

drop that I like my bagpipes and rig it

in a very special way so that it just

kind of goes DF will continue and

because he's giving all the information

to the king but he is just staring at a

zon while he's saying all

this while the conversations like to

direct that within the halls of the fire

Giants stood in iron golem one that

could be commanded and used for

destruction and was somehow within the

grasp of the fire Giants perhaps even

delivered and without inside of that was

but as a sigil of the bronze fire clan

and me I was inside of him - your

bodyguard was not here or sent for the

benevolence of Allah Citadel at bar that

was only he was only sent to cover your

own ass mmm oh the gym you have spoken

ill of Maya and he turns to the king and

says not true longs oh no it's

definitely true the King uh turns to

Azon and uh says we will look into that

until vain King I can cook only suggest

that you keep yourself under extra

protection only trusted guards and keep

Azon here and just watch or corrington

hang out with Jasper or he's nice uh yes

you see a couple other advisors kind of

push in front of a Zhan a little bit

closer toward the King and offer their

clan services or protection and you can

see instantly a lot of sort of political

things sort of happening in all express

and the dwarves in this moment a z' on

he he hasn't been able to muster any

kind of response in he's trying to talk

to the king but the other advisers are

talking over him now and so there's a

lot of dwarven chatter and you see a

Zhan just sort of melt into the

background a little bit obviously his

voice isn't going to carry over his

peers even though he's the senior

advisor you can see others asserting

themselves like they haven't before

and suddenly he was very despondent ah

I'll even point out to the king that a

son was the first to retreat when the

throne room was ambushed almost as if he

knew he says it is clearly a slanderous

statement and his voice is still being

muffled by some of the other dwarves and

he's giving his assurances to the King

that a golem if it were a bronze fire

construct must have been stolen it could

have been stolen in some ancient war I

bow and I say Your Majesty if you would

like I may aid you in the search for

truth and the King turns to you and says

do you have a name proof any way to

corroborate your statements well I can

make sure that he's telling you the

truth that's all idea you can make an

insight check alright

also Strix will like point to the like

flask in her robe at Deus really I don't

know it's she's like okay let's take

some bacon oh that's a good insight uh

seventeen so helped somewhat by Strix

you know that if a creature is released

from the iron flask it must obey you for

an hour right promise

oh he just has kind of a thing about

releasing things from the flask right I

just would rather not know obey us for

an hour it's fine I'll open it then they

went after the hour what we'll put it

back in before the hour is over yeah but

it's harder to put him back in I kind of

stand in front of them like Greg King

were like bickering back and trying to

distract him I'll shake the bottle look

I gave him a good shake at this point

Strix just has it out she just like has

forgotten that it's supposed to be

hidden and she's like holding it on me

like well just let him out

does the Kings the eldest or did I

distract him you have distracted him you

coupled with various other

shouting in his ear and azon trying his

best to get the Kings attention and

assure him that the bronze fires have

not made golems in Aeons hmm all right

strike something like this

so open the flask ah all right when you

open the flask everybody stops talking

as sand begins to spill out of the neck

of the flask onto the floor in front of

you and coalesce and take the form of an

8 or 9 foot tall stone skinned man with

eyes of molten gold a Strix will just

point at him and be like yeah you you

Burks remember the the dwarf in the

armor well he wasn't a dwarf he was a

Jim then he's really tall and was super

mean very is it worse and Kihara q tell

them what you were doing there all right

accusatorial e uh Carrick will tell the

King in his booming his swimming a voice

that he was sent well he looks at you

Strix and he doesn't want to say

anything but he sort of forced to she's

like so he's kind of scowling at you the

whole time he's talking uh and so he

just scowls at you and tells the King

that I was sent into the mountain to

find the iron golem built by clan bronze

fire and see it safely brought here

without anyone knowing about a gift to

the fire giant civil token of their

ancients alliance and of course the

whole room just erupts to the sound of

this testimony and a's on bronze fire is

just horrified oh I look over him oops

and part of gestures - Azon bronze fire

says yes I know that I am your thrall

and that this task would have ensured my

freedom but this iron flask it's

irresistible yes there's just no way I

can lie Couric's simply

listen to us and we will ensure your

freedom go on mmm

one step at a time he says when he when

he hears you say that he tries to the

king and he says there was some ruin

inscribed on the inside of the golem

with hatch the bronze fire insignia on

it at this how I knew it was the right

one

sounds like proof to me extraction is

like right the king entirely convinced

by this compelled testimony we'll have

the two of the advisors go off and ring

the dong to summon the guards so that

they can take a zon bronze fire into

custody for questioning and that

basically happens before you guards come

in King point stays on bronze fire has

him taken away the old man is hauled off

unceremoniously as the other Mormon

advisors chosen up to king's throne can

I hold the flask back up to Kihara can

be like unless you want to negotiate

your freedom with us get back in stonee

but 0th he says this is most of Lasky

goes to get back my robe mm-hmm giggling

to yourself no that's great hmm by the

way he has to pay attention to us for an

hour so you know we can let him out

whenever we want em yeah yeah is that a

cumulative our wonderful power every

time I release oh my gets a whole hour

so I think we fit like a good seven

minutes just now yeah searches like wait

what if it is cumulative didn't didn't

you didn't he know that that was his

insight so he would know right does he

know which one it is which one what is

whether it's cumulative hour or an hour

every time we let him out

if you if you understand the way the

mechanism works as it was described to

you by your drow friend cozen when you

release him he is bound to serve you for

an hour yeah all right

dead stop so we get an hour every time

of his time until we get tired of him

and then he will haunt us to the ends of

the earth to kill us but you know as

long as he stays in there it's fine

correct it's like we have a real Genie

mm-hmm Stroh do you think the genie

might be blessed by Saint markovia

oh my probably not okay you're right

it's a nice thought yep

so your business concluded with the King

and his demand that you return to him in

three days he reiterates that as you

leave I'd like everybody to make an

insight check oh my gosh 1604 11:15 okay

paulten and Strix you go the sense that

the king um he is very uncomfortable at

the moment something is concerning him

deeply and you think that he has

something important to tell you but he's

not ready to tell you yet can I look at

him and say uh do you wanna do you wanna

hang out later and get some tea three

days you sure you don't want me tea you

can come to our room in the end can I

look at him and persuasively yeah don't

do it say uh you know if there's

something more you need to tell us we're

we're we're homies uh make a persuasion

can I give a winning smile next to him

to aid his persuasion check yes that's

so you have advantage of the second

false tricks is just like do you want

some dirty tea be a seventeen all right

uh so uh the King will take the

unprecedent step unprecedented step of

dismissing his advisors um they all keep

the shock and horror and then he gets

frustrated with them and literally

banishes them from the room and after

the last of them have retreated through

secret doors behind the throne he says

to you now in the empty Hall except for

you and him that he actually leans in

does he thinks you know almost as if he

thinks there's like magical scrying

sensors in the room that don't want to

hear him he sort of has you come close

to in this plus it is to gather around

the throne I am not really okay I'm

sorry

what I am not ignore no that's kind of

Awesome Arnab died during the silver

marches it placed me on row the tape

everyone know they're doing a good job

calm he says I'm gonna need your help

eight days otherwise I could die last

Earhart forbid yes I think someone is

plotting to kill me

I thought were just her Caravaca yes

well guards once who turned on me they

were taken down into the dungeons and

confined there you found them all they

were dead in their cells you don't know

what killed them but they were torn up I

claws and teeth cool great okay cool

uh-huh yep who are you who are you

really then he says I am a creature

called a doppelganger Oh God oh okay

sighs bill while I'm sitting here on the

throne I plan to use my power to

whatever advantage I can to help you but

it was a baaad he says I'm having

letters of recommendation written and

metals crafted in your honor

if there's anything I can do let me know

but in three days I'm gonna need your

help

so like what if two of us are like kind

of dying he says what do you happen to

be blessed by st. markovia Strix is

still throwing up next to the ideas well

like this her back alright

even's holding her hair back no he says

in three days a delegation from yds our

wives I think that might be covered okay

what do you want us to do don't do

anything and don't tell anybody come

back in three days got it

so what's there to do around here for

three days why are you asking him for

Rex

Oh

[Music]

uh he says others but drinking alright

we'll be fine

do you need all four of us back or will

three of this work smell of us are gonna

scare okay that's good

can you turn it can you make yourself

look like just anybody yes good very

good at imitating others roughly my size

he says what about you or any of you put

it imitating other people Strix is like

I am oh do me do it

he sort of grabbed he sort of takes

tricks by the hand no and says I will

need your help most of all oh is this

ham like slimy I expect doppelgangers to

be slimy

I need oars like it's like a dwarf okay

well she feels better about so he's got

sort of scratchy hands okay she's like

okay what do you need her for why her

you'd be gentle with her yes he says oh

if you are willing tell me in three days

one of the things I could use is someone

to take my place that is a terrible idea

oh she's real good at that one time she

imitated the spam Fire Lord Stroud it

was so convincing yes he and he turns to

us tricks and says you'll get to be the

game like yeah you get to be the king

that's cool way but where are you going

why can't you keep being the king cuz I

don't want to be killed

well they're gonna go I yeah I want her

to be killed even but you happen

prevailed in this mission and managed to

get back him back from the fire giant

surely you are much more capable of

dealing with this than I am and I can't

let my advisers know what I've told you

okay he says think about it oh we will

three days all right leaving dude wait

how many days as soon as dia says by

relieving Strix just takes off like all

right hey your audience concludes as we

leave even grabs

evylyn is very much shorter than deaath

as diaz mentioned so even like kind of

grabs him around the waist she's doing

that thing where you're walking with

somebody and just kind of like hanging

on them as they walked she's like I was

real good you thought you did such a

good job like given those speeches and

telling people what we did that was

great as we're leaving I'm just like

there's it was nice meeting with you

King and I like you okay we'll see you

in three days

okay all right as you head out make your

way back to the hammered dwarf the end

where you're staying you you can tell as

you're moving back to the crowds and

being led by your escort that ever since

the advisers retreated from the room

word of your deeds up at Mount hammer

has have already echoed through the

complex and Dee ass tail is now being

spun and told and passed along among the

dwarves and dwarves that may have just

kind of guess not

they sort of come up to you and Pat you

or smile at you give you thumbs up they

look their mugs up to you as you pass

and all in all a very kind of happy

procession levander bless you yes

blessings in the light of the morning

lore

yes I mean he's trying to find you I do

not reciprocate their enthusiasm okay

yes like mm-hmm just like oh this is not

gonna last

mmm and then like Paulette in every once

in a while like somebody will just hold

a full mug of beer up in front of you so

go thank strength or not you're trying

to pawn off the empty one something is

taken from your hand and another one is

stuffed in your hand so guys we're gonna

be okay

is this maybe I'll just die before that

much by the time you get back to the

hammered dwarf I'd like you to make a

constitution okay

does does it does anyone offer any of

the rest of us beer

oh yeah everybody's sticking beer in

everybody's faces that would be an 11 ok

paltin is unconscious and you're kind of

dragging him by the time you get back to

the inn

even tried to like so at first she

wasn't paying any attention to this

alcohol being shoved in their faces but

then paltin seemed to be having such a

good time and she really wanted to hang

out with palton so she took one and she

kind of was sipping it and then like she

took another and so she's had like three

beers which pretty bland is like a lot

so I take notice and like before I hit

the ground like hey don't be like me it

was just kind of stares it in like mixed

I was going to take one but then she

realized that she didn't want it but she

took one of the old cultist heart out

but unitive taking off the ground and

just like oh get in and someone's beard

it's like here you go away all right so

there's a marinating heart beer

marinated heart mm-hmm you know just

kind of like gets really close to stir

she's like you're so pretty I'm gonna

miss you firstly please stop okay she's

going to die we all know no no honey

time the line of the morning large yard

but given a breath I hate this

technically I wonder what Lysander looks

like do you think he's just like I think

he's so pretty I think he must look just

when you worship levander does he think

he's pretty no oh my god it totally is

he's the source of a lot how would I see

how pretty you are

without light usually people would say

that I'm pretty without light yes

and we just get back to the end please

oh yeah you're back to the end and it

was a kill a fair amount of time there

in the course of a few days pass a

couple more days pass and DF and Strix

your hit point maximum drops by one each

day so to total even went on Osteria

sarin during that time and came back ok

all right

ah and even you've also been receiving

progress reports on the construct that

you have wanted Simon rebuilt how's the

progress uh uh master flame Bane won't

show you the work while he's working on

it but his assistants assure you that he

they say in confidence to you that he

was inspired by your beauty and has sort

of redoubled his efforts and he plans to

have it finished sooner than expected

how sooner they don't race there he's

being very secretive and they he they're

not even allowed in his workshop at this

point they can hear him though hammering

making noises assembling things and but

every time he takes a break for food or

whatever he just says that when he met

you it's like you had an aura around you

and he's was struck by it and he in his

mumbly way I can't get you out of his

mind

ah even thinks that's just the sweetest

trying to trying to get that five star

damn y'all TR yo um cool so I guess I um

is there a way that I like are they

gonna send me a messenger when it's done

yes okay stretch will also finish the

Raven costume my shoes yes you make

another performance intelligence

performance check fancy better this time

yeah oh well great cool uh twenty yeah

you made a fabulous costume you've got

like a like a stuffed head make long

raven

that he can wear big feathers and you

know coming off him big black feathered

gown essentially and probably some like

a little claws he can wear Oh

I'll hand it to him make one one eye is

winking and she's like I made it winking

for you you can only see out of one eye

paltin can only be turn this way even

throughout all of these little

activities you just noticed that she's

like extra clingy like she's always

holding on to somebody or like looking

at somebody and she's just like like

like that little dog or cat that like

won't leave you alone is just always

staring at you like I love you I love

you I love you I love you um van Rycke

there's like a montage where you're

doing that and the costume is being said

on Paul's headband Brickton is having

dwars make these perfect little ring

bands of gold

he's securing costuming stuff and

incense and he says that he is ready to

perform the ritual on the very next

morning he secured a chamber we turret

in the fortress of Citadel ad bar that

has windows looking out to the east so

that the dawn and shine through during

the ritual and he's had Forbes provide

the necessary furnishings so this will

be your last night even even you can see

that she has kind of this smile like

this on all the time and she's

uncharacteristically somber she's not

really saying much she's just kind of

like staring lovingly at everybody she

says well I guess it's a guess it's time

for bed you're not going to die ayushman

men Rickman doesn't actually sleep and

stay with you guys he just drops by

periodically to give you updates he's

staying somewhere else at the end so he

can doesn't have to cross paths with

Paul and I get attacked by more

furniture I

before he leaves I asked him for details

about the ritual like what what will be

required of me so what will be required

of you is you will lie on

a beer a stone beer a BER but be I your

friends will your two friends will be in

chairs on each side of the mirror all

three of you be wearing golden rings

there will be cups of morning you set

about and a stained glass window rigged

so that coloured light of dawn will

shine upon you

van Rycke Tanakh fit on and his holy

symbol of the morning Lord Bolton will

be standing next to him and while man

written utters the chance the the

Bustani chance of the ritual Halton will

also chant alongside him a refrain in

the dawn beauty reigns and the way is

clearer that is way to the afterlife in

the dawn beauty reigns and the way is

clear that's that same bear right that's

right

uh uh and you so basically you will just

have to lie there evylyn and be prepared

to let let the blessing of st. markovia

leave you at various points you will be

asked to impart this blessing to your

friends and then sometime thereafter you

will expire okay so there's no like

weapon involved or definitive moment

there's just no I will be transported to

the light yes

evylyn kind of takes all this in a very

clinical like kind of clears throat a

lot of times while she's asking these

things but she's like okay and um and

then upon the you know she's bit like

very clinical about it um and having

heard all that yep

uh I guess she asks everybody else

didn't do it does anybody else have any

questions about the rich this is not

okay dia this is not okay why aren't you

talking to us it's not okay

cuz DF dreamed about orbs trying to hash

last night

this is not okay you can't let this

happen we can't let this happen I don't

care if I'm sick I'm fine I can do magic

I know magic tricks is obviously

panicking and this will happen in the

she kind of ignored like Strix panic is

totally normal doesn't yeah a couple of

or dawn you'll travel to the east side

of citadel ad bar to the chamber and

there you will be sequestered now Jasper

dimmer Kasim

van Rycke didn't sort of ran into him

out me in and talked him into not

talking talked the dwarf into not

disturbing you guys because he knew how

sick you were and how kind of out you

were but Jasper expressed an interest in

overseeing the ritual to make sure

everything goes lay and then written

reluctantly conceded but why luckily no

why why why does Jasper want to be there

why does he want to see this because he

feels he owes you something says been

written he's trying to be helpful and he

can't be so you know you can stand by

and watch all right I mean if you don't

want him there I can make him stand out

he's been written says I could make him

stand outside yeah it's fun with us too

oh yeah she's been capering around and

eating eating stuff alright yeah coupang

starts pool points at her is like you

can't leave your child

she only poops and strips his bed so

it's okay I mean that's the smelliest

one strikes doesn't notice she's like it

yeah you're like me she's not supposed

to yeah um so even kind of like gets all

this down and she's kind of like yeah

you've noticed it's hard to tell with

Strix because of the the nature of the

tiefling skintone but you can see that

DF has got little lesions forming on his

skin um on this after after three days

of deterioration okay well when do you

guys all want to get up in the morning

to head over to the place we're not

having this right I don't see how we

could not

I don't either but we can't do this time

to run no I don't think we can run from

this we I mean we could for 27 days she

looks at them on she says do you guys

know about my oath my paladin tells the

oath of the ancient some bum morning

light and Lysander really a lot of it

just got orders to guess tricks is just

covering her head on the ground not

listening anymore

well there's there's quite a bit to it

but one part of my oath calls me to be

the light and that means to be the

glorious beacon for all who live in

despair to let the light of my joy and

courage shine forth in all of your deeds

and I think I'm being called to show

that joy and courage right now I've

known since I was a little baby that I

was going to be called for something

like this and what better way to die

than in the service of the people you

love the most

that's well it may be but I

think I need to be alone for a little

while I'm I'll meet up with you guys

before before dawn back here and she

kind of just goes and she's looking for

like a rooftop she's goes looking for a

rooftop to sit up on by herself

okay so citilab bar is entirely

underground but so she tries to go above

ground yeah so you can you can basically

find a way out and then perch on a

turret on the some sort of rocky

mountain side and sort of look down upon

the great stone causeway that leads from

the gates of said lab bar down to the

ground um and you know a couple birds

fly by but nobody disturbs you up here

you kind of noticed cuz as she says this

thing she has like a a big smile but you

can kind of see the cracks forming and

that yeah

in her face and when she excuses herself

it's obvious that she's like I I need to

go for a minute and then she just leaves

okay okay hear me out

Amy I guess yeah I'm still here circus

likes to stand here

i what listen I have a spell that can

help us it's it's it's a spell that I

just learned

it's called deaf ward can I like Oh

singer it means to old die

will that actually work in a ritual

setting I don't know but I know magic

could I like stealth follow evylyn sure

make a stealth check opposed by evil ins

perception check it's just horrible as

we all know while they're baking sex

tricks is like deaf maybe you can throw

up some blood or something and I can put

it in another potion and then that can

be where copious blood right cue me out

the ritual said that it's need someone

blessed by markovia right yeah I

literally have McRobbie inside of me am

I not blessed I don't know man I don't

know that kind of magic right so what if

instead of evil in I go on the table

instead and then that way you'll least

be okay and then just yes I won't let

her

oh I'm sorry paltin what was your role

18 and 6 okay you are you're able to

shadow evil in all the way outside the

Citadel and see her find purchase in the

most Awkward place so if you want to

keep some climbing and scampering but

but unseen okay

she's she just finds a place to sit and

she kind of like you can see her you

know pull her knees up and wrap her arms

on her knees and just kind of look

around and look to this guide she's kind

of coming the day is fading into night

gradually as Glynn is doing this and

she's watching the Sun and she's kind of

she keeps humming the same tune over and

over this like what sounds like a sacred

hymn after like yeah just like a couple

minutes I'm display uh probably however

many feet behind just cut up you hear

she like sits up without turning around

and then you can kind of browse her head

and doesn't say anything I'm just gonna

walk over and like sit next to her but

like just still looking out I just asked

her like so this is what's happening she

has been hiding her face but she turns

to palton and tears are just streaming

down her face like her you've never seen

her face so wet and she just looks at

him a nod she doesn't even try to say

anything

this is stupid

like no if it were someone else like if

someone else had told us this maybe but

I can not I cannot justify this coming

from that

she kind of looks at paulten and she

kind of like smiles just a tiny bit like

watery eyed weak smile she reaches up

and just brushes some hair out of his

eye and then she kisses him she

and she says it'll be okay this is what

I was meant for it's like you will be

okay but that's not what's gonna happen

what is gonna happen she kind of just

like is starting to laugh and like look

at him lovingly no no I don't think this

I don't see this as the only option well

we're getting kind of short on time hmm

you said what like 21 days something

like that I think we got more time the

ritual is tomorrow I say okay if she

looks around she's like today even cuz

it's the wee hours and she says look I

need you to look after Simon he's gonna

be fine and so are you and he needs to

grow up just like you say way what no

salmon yeah we're done I wasn't aware of

the repair it she had done it

surreptitiously okay see yeah the one

that was I'd hope to surprise you but

but he's being repaired right now but

the best the best mechanic robot man

that dwarves have to offer and and I

know we can bring him back just the way

he was I know that Strix can do it I can

do it hopefully he's hopefully he's back

real soon and I I need you to teach him

and also there's an armor that I talked

to and I asked him that once I'm gone

maybe he could take my my breastplate

and my bracers he can make him into some

armor for Simon and maybe when he's old

enough you could give it to him

I'm a little unsure of how robot aging

works but well I don't want him fightin

before he's he's capable you don't let

him get into battle before he's at least

I don't know 12 years old in robot years

yeah okay okay okay um Strix in part

sorry are you guys gonna retreat like go

back inside when it gets cold and icy

out here

I'd imagine but we're in whatever room

just spouting yeah we're just added

ideas at each other nothing stuff like

uh trying to shove D its hand into a

bottle like maybe we just put a little

bit of you in here

so nobody nobody sleeps that night but

but hold on before yeah evylyn doesn't

go inside she wants to stay out there

for a while okay but before she does she

kind of just like you know they're both

sitting there she leans her head on

pelton shoulder and she asks we sing for

me one last time

sure I'll play play a little song all

what do I have bagpipes don't seem

appropriate

she actually hurry when you when you

start when you start to look around for

an instrument she she actually pulls out

those panpipes she's only tried to play

in front of you one time she kind of

looks at him and she's like I was never

much good at this anyway and she Hanson

to you all right so you sort of grab

these sort of shitty panpipes like oh if

you want to you can make a performance

check turn yes that's true

oh god what a bad bi one sixty one

thinks it's lovely anyway right yes Oh

Forney uh total twenty right yeah it's a

it's a wonderful song evil it's a song

you'll treasure and remember for the

rest of your well

little alright uh um it's the best

thing you ever heard

it's actually I think it's probably the

hint to sunshine which is what she was

humming to herself and that's probably

he probably knew that song um and so

it's just about like looking to the

morning Lord and trusting him and

pledging your soul to him so that he can

remake you and remake you over and over

again in a shining image of his glory

um but once he does that she kind of

like takes deep breath and she looks at

him and she nods and she says let's go

back inside

all right you find strix and EF just

dead they killed each other problem

solved itself

all right so you have a none restful

hours of the morning mere hours before

you are due to convene even starts like

just unpacking her pack and she's like

all right um des uh here she takes off

her boots she's like you definitely need

these it'll help I promise she answered

him the boots

she's like holds them with weak arms

yeah and then she takes her two javelins

that are left and she's like - I can't -

here you go she gives it to um and then

she takes out the bag of light fall just

shards and she was like I don't know

what to do with this but you've always

done a real good job of making something

beautiful out of a whole lot of broken

pieces and I know you're gonna keep

doing that and she hands him the bag of

a broken light fall she's like I don't

know maybe I'd make some real nice

daggers for you or something it is

blessed by the morning Lord after all

all right he'll take it and just like

he's like just looking straight down the

entire time with no words okay uh then

she turns to Strix

whose stuffing things in a jar like

she's only just putting it in there

she's like poured some wine in there

it's like she's shaking around uh she

also actually right before she's like oh

yeah and also and she like hands DF

basically the rest of her armoury like

it's like oh yeah I'll just do whatever

love this stuff so there's no like over

this is like a short sword that she

picked up somewhere yeah yeah she did a

little while ago and also a hand

crossbow wait man yeah and she also

gives you the the heart of Spinelli the

flame sword a fall neighbor Oh God

and she's like you might want to give

this to Jasper I don't know but it's

real special you what you you do what's

best with it anyway stanzin armor then

she turns tricks um she gives Strix like

she has some of the some jewels and

stuff that they picked up in the Yaak

village that are real pretty and she

gives us like this incense that she

picked up there like a whole bunch of

little trinkets yes when she sent

hands on the inside she's like dude do

you say I smell bad I mean you do but

that's not why I just thought you'd like

it

alright I like I like your bad smell I

always have oh that's gross um she also

pulls out this um this book and it's a

book about etiquette the book about

manners this is little tiny dog eared

book and she's like this was given to me

by my mother it's real special and let

me show you and she opens it up and

there's a four-leaf clover Preston there

and she's like this is where all my luck

comes from and she closes it she's like

now I want you to have it she granted

that she handed to the book and as soon

as she does strix opens up grabs the

four-leaf clover and shoves it into the

pumpkin and he was like shocked but

she's kind of like drink it now uh

there's no liquid in there just like

Randy was she gonna like hold and she's

like just a minute she sets it down oh

yes strict forgot the spit in it and

then she even pulls out June

and junipers actually napping because

Jennifer was always a she's a little fat

little mouse and she kind of kisses

juniper and juniper kind of wakes up and

even just like scratches behind her

little ear and then she she holds judah

practice tricks and she's like just nods

and hands it to her her soul take

juniper or be like you're getting this

back after you come back in like a

second and stop talking to pretty boy by

hander and as soon as when she takes

juniper i'm like you take care of them

you take care of stinky and Strix

juniper them yeah oh um she'll disappear

into her robes like god only knows

what's in there uh and so then she turns

to palton Minj and she the one thing

that she didn't give D at this tree Bain

because it's the coolest thing she has

she thinks so she gives she hands that

to Paulson ceremoniously if you have

this elven axe pump yeah like this is

for you and um and she's like and also

you need to go to mr. mr. Franks robot

shop Oh Buster Tyrone flame brain yes

master Tom flame Bane real soon there's

a messenger that's gonna come he's gonna

tell you that Sam is ready and you go

pick up our son he's gonna be there and

don't forget what I said about my armor

so I take off my armor and I hand that

to him too yeah yeah she has tons of

stuff and then I also I wear this signet

ring of my family like my noble family

and I just I don't say anything but I

just kind of take that off and I just

kind of like put it in his hand and

close it and while she's doing this

tricks is gonna walk up behind her and

cast the Deathlord spell do I notice uh

so yeah well yeah it's a verbal somatic

component spell so yeah you would notice

we cast a spell on you now now um Holly

you know that if the target drops to

zero hit points this would prevent them

from actually dropping these ear points

and they drop to one but if the target

is subjected to an effect that would

kill it without dealing damage the

effect is instead negated

against the target Strix probably does

that but she's just hoping it's gonna

work okay so you're negating any effect

that would happen to me

negating their ritual basic oh wait no

she doesn't want to make eight the

ritual that oh I thought I thought it

was just like she's just doing it to

help right never mind I won't do it

so once evil ins done all that like she

she's kind of again kept this like the

cheery Eveland based on but this this is

starting to get really real so you see

her eyes are a little bit wide and she's

kind of like breathing deep and like

trying not to crack so she's like here

and she pulls out um

letters that she wrote to each each of

Strix Diaz and Paulson and she hands it

to them and she's like okay anyway uh

now that that's done it's it's time to

be the light let's let's go all right

you guys pack away your letters yeah no

don't write it now ring later it's just

this little something okay up in the

turret you can see everything has been

laid out there is a stone beer upon

which evylyn is to lie and two big heavy

stone chairs that sort of swallow DF and

Strix up by their size and volume

standing on each side of the beer there

is light just beginning to shine through

windows on the top of the turret and

stained glass has been fitted into the

windows creating a kaleidoscope of

colors on stone walls and floor around

you you can see that these windows have

been specially crafted to bear symbols

of the Sun and other motifs of the

morning including images of babies and

other newborn features like fawns and

ducklings and owlbear and baby out there

and stuff like that that's a question do

you want waffles to be here for the Yak

or no oh come on

waffles loves you that's why she

shouldn't see this no child should grow

up with an image like this of their

mother

waffles waits outside the door Jasper

Jasper can watch waffles outside the

room there you go he's helping and you

take good care of her

you teach her how to be good and strong

van Rycke tan is practically

unrecognizable when he arrives he's

wearing a full golden robe with a gold

pointed hood that covers everything but

his eyes and he's got goggles strapped

over that they're like sun goggles

they're tinted

and he also hands a pair of Sun goggles

to paltin but on underneath his raven

head it sounds a little mad scientist

eek it does seem a little mad scientist

II I'm afraid when he starts chanting

evil and make it religion check am i

laying down already I'm there yeah

you're there oh I cannot roll to save my

life today that's a ten okay to you the

chance of Van Vechten seemed legit you

they harken back to things you heard as

a child growing up in the faith but they

seemed much older and a little bit

antiquated in their language but as he

speaks them the light of the dawn

becomes increasingly intense

what's so bright it practically fills

the room and the rings that you three of

you have slipped on your finger begin to

catch that light and glow and suddenly

springing from evylyn out of her are

radiant beams of light that wash over

both DF and and it's a despite the fact

that it's blinding and you guys it

doesn't seem to affect you too at all

this is a warm welcoming light that's

soaked into your body can I reach both

of their hands from where I'm laying yes

your tiny little arms can stretch out

they can stretch out there

withering hands to grab yours I just

thought it grabs it I just hold and look

at them lovingly and put on a strong

face okay so grab it too but be sad

evil and when you do you can feel Marko

vayas blessing just sort of well out

from you in a very kind of this is a

like you just let it go and as it goes

you can feel it going into your friends

and suddenly you find yourself flying

through the ether on the back of morning

glory

ah like literally I was like crying and

then she she feels Morning Glory she

because she has someone that she knows

she holds on tight

yes and as you fly toward the light on

Morning Glory you see three resplendent

figures waiting for you ahead one of

them is an old man and you can see that

he has a sort of gold and white locks

and he has a staff with the symbol of

the Sun on top and he looks like a

divine cleric of some kind a saint and

you remember vaguely in morovia in

places like Argan vault and the church

of the village Rovia seeing this man

identified as Saint Andre on the other

side you see what you know instinctively

as Saint markovia

a warrior woman a paladin who's wearing

full armor and has her a big hammer he's

hanging beside her you can see she's

missing one of her legs but can stand

perfectly fine on the one that remains

and she's got a warm inviting smile in

between them you see the morning Lord

Himself and in his arms he's got a

little baby that he's just sort of

couching and he is a absolutely

stunningly gorgeous man I'm not old not

young just sort of ageless and he seems

to be waiting you while cradling this

child and it's at that point when

horrible black tendrils rip you a

Morning Glory

yeah and bear you toward the black

gaping maw of a great green devil face

halten why you find yourself traveling

in the ether as well unless you hurt you

were standing in the room next to Van

Rycke and going this is going to work

this is stupid low light oh my god and

then uh and then and you can't even

drink because the big Raven heads on

your face but in a moment you were just

sort of transported to the ether and

kind of flying behind her and you can

only see

one-eye but you think you are actually

in the ether and you see her being

stolen away by these dark tendrils that

are bearing her into the gaping mouth of

this green devil face and it looks like

the the divine beings are reaching out

for her she's being torn away too fast

so am I just kind of like floating here

do I have any kind of like control or uh

you you feel like you've been changed

into a black bird some sort of spirit so

I feel like I can like fly around and

yeah um I guess so you see you've got

sort of big hooked claws I'm gonna

freakin dive bomb and go after all right

I would like you to make a uh let's call

it a charisma jacket and some ice

actually here you're just here in spirit

even as you're being pulled away you can

see what appears to be a raven a black

raven descending toward you with its

claws outstretched make your charisma

check I did lie oh I'm not gonna lie cuz

it's right there somehow this bird

manages to pull you free of the tendrils

evylyn and you sort of go floating

flying away from the dark face and you

see uh just the the evil Menace of the

devil face gets farther and farther away

as you are thrown off halten mmm find

yourself suddenly as you dressed in your

raven costume standing inside the

crumbled ruins of a citadel perched on

what must be some sort of mountain or

something

through sort of broken malformed windows

you can see what appears to be a winter

valley outside and there are torches on

the outside of this citadel or castle

between the windows burning and this is

a sort of a gray kind of colourless

place you have found yourself and you're

in a hallway that has doors closed doors

on one side these open windows on the

other and at the far end a set of open

double doors just barely hanging on to

their hinges and beyond it you hear a

sound catch you are alone that's a noise

to avoid I don't like that and you hear

what appears to be cracking twigs okay I

guess I can I roll in anything to figure

out what the hell I should do I make an

insight okay here we go

panic and roll in anything uh-oh not all

14 the 14 you can only gauge that some

force has brought you here or something

has something has brought you here I

figured and it's not a world that you

know like you look out through those

windows you see mountains that are far

too dark and far too sheer we found in

any normal world and this wasteland

winter wasteland seems to be absolutely

devoid of all life there's there's

something about this place that is

vaguely feels vaguely familiar you know

you've never been here before but

something in you has been here before

okay I uh I guess well so it's just

there's pretty much doors and that's

like that if there's closed doors on

your right side and open doors on your

dead ahead of you at the end of the hall

and it's through those doors that you

hear the crunching of twigs the set the

other sound that you hear this sort of

echoing change seems to be coming from

outside the Citadel I'm going to go

toward the scary sound okay let the

crunching of twigs actually doors yeah

when you go through the doors you see or

carefully yeah making actually make a

stealth check if you're trying to be

quiet in your bird costume okay cool ooh

uh nineteen yeah you sneak into that

room a room that is in such horrible in

such a horrible state that there are

huge gashes in the pitched roof where

shingles have fallen away and rafters

have splintered and you see a few stray

blackbirds flying in and out that looked

clearly like crows to you and on the far

side of the room is what appears to be

the shattered remains of the big round

window which used to have an iron frame

in it that frame kind of reminiscent of

a Sun symbol but it's old and rusted and

there are no panes of glass in the

window anymore

it's silhouetted against that open

window you see a figure that at first

looks like like a Crone or a woman

wearing some sort of robe but as as

little as as a little bit of as your

eyes adjust to this dark dilapidated

room where all the furnishings have just

collapsed into piles and heaps of rubble

you can see that it's not really a

person at all but what looks like a nest

that has taken on a humanoid form

like a living nest ill uh and there's

just like a dark

opening where the face

should be in LA in this water rest oh oh

cross do I do I have like any inkling

what that is uh make a religion check ho

boy

yep okay hmm intelligence if you don't

that would be a nine yes no you don't

know what this is um but in the second

it takes you to consider what this might

be you see that it is gone from being 30

feet away to being five feet away oh hi

out of this dark hole where its face

should be suddenly hundreds of birds fly

out to slay us in my space just sort of

in your face like blasting path tearing

at you with their their wings and such

as they blast by and then as they exit

she holds up up her it it's hand looks

like it's made of twigs but it holds

something up and presses it on your lips

and you realize it is a desiccated black

human hand that's been severed at the

wrist it's Julie's oh oh oh and as it

touches your lips uh voice bills your

head and says daiquiri

hey pet let it watch the chalice come

again your daiquiri okay hey bets hmm

let it watch

yes same what do you do

question of the day what can I do well

you're standing in front of this figure

and it's holding up and it's twig arm a

summer a severed black and desiccated

human hand one finger probably like the

middle finger how its stretched and just

sort of petrified they're pressed up

against your lips today one do I take it

do you like thank you yes you take the

desiccated that I'd had hmm and then uh

the pile of sticks in front of you that

is a humanoid shape collapses into a

heap yeah do I sell the hand good

question I'll get back to that in just a

minute

what DF and strix the light washes

through the the sunlight of dawn

completely consumes evylyn and you can't

feel her hand anymore ah uh-huh but uh

the pain that and the suffering that you

have felt these last few days is all but

gone and you can see van Rycke ttan has

fallen over and is lying on the floor

either dead or unconscious you can't

tell good uh Hulk is gone

Oh is evil and gone too

as the light sort of tapers down to

normal you realize the two of you are

the only ones in the room and the goal

that surrounds you seems to bleed out

until only the rings around your finger

are glowing

but it's a it's a dawn glow it's a very

uncomfortable

you can see even and all of her

remaining clothing and the gold ring she

was wearing are gone the beer is empty

the Strix will just rifle around all the

stuff just like on the table like it's

gotta be here somewhere

where'd she go maybe she's down here

Strix what happened I don't know can I

do it our contact uh yes go ahead

I'm just still screaming I don't know

eighteen uh you believe that evylyn has

been spirited away into the afterlife

into the light what her body's gone to

okay so apparently she she's dead but

her body went to which means she just

went to another plane which honestly is

fine we can go get her it'll be okay at

this point Jasper kind of bursts into

the room with waffles cuz he's heard you

screaming i season the chaos but doesn't

know what to make of anything evylyn yes

you after being flung away from the

darkness that was the soul monger that

was trying to claim your soul and

deprive the deprived the morning Lord of

your presence after being flung away you

find yourself a kind of in light for a

moment this blinding light no sign of

the crow no sign of your morning glory

no sign of anything and then uh the

light sort of gradually turns to a sort

of a soft night darkness around you and

you hear snoring

you hear yourself talking and uh you

suddenly think somehow paltin has saved

your life and you're alive but you've

just been asleep you open your eyes yes

like one at a time very slowly as you

open your eyes and you look about the

first thing you see on the floor in

front of you is paltin dressed in his

bird costume lying unconscious in the

floor with a severed hand that

desiccating black run dessicated black

hand in his sort of claw glove but lying

there on the floor all of his feathers

kind of laid out around him and you

instantly realized that he was he was

the raven that freed you from the soul

hunger and as you look farther into the

room you see in the dim light tables and

shelves covered with toys and gizmos and

a sleeping old dwarf passed out on a

sort of on a table and on his stool and

as you look down and look at your hands

you see that they are crafted out of

gold

wood and others and that's where we'll

stop this is insane this is insane oh

okay

and as you sort of look over against one

wall you kind of see this stained mirror

on the wall you kind of look at your

reflection it looks almost exactly like

you like it's not crafted in simon's

likeness at all but in you

but like a like a medal yeah like robot

evylyn yes like mecha even yes with like

gold golden locks the whole bit ah

evylyn is shocked and she's looking at

her own hands and opening and closing

them like as when she first saw Alton

she went to like hug him but as soon as

she saw her hand in front of her she

stopped and lose like stopped by it yep

and it looks like the scale is the same

as like you're the same size as you were

relative to him and everything else

around you just you are alright so just

so you know guys I hate to do this to

you but we're not playing next because

several several of the waffle crew folks
