you

hi everybody and welcome to the last

episode of dice camera action in 2017

all right

before we get started I have a piece of

art here from Emily Scott just wanted to

share that previously and dice camera

action

the adventurers were dealing with some

issues with snow they were caught in a

blizzard when they were rescued by a

captain's and Ella and her airship and

in exchange for safe passage

they helped this captain retrieve an

artifact called the ring of winter or

rather they were on a quest to do that

and they discovered that someone had

beat them to it a man named artis Cimber

a member of an organization called the

Harper's stole the ring before they

could but they were able to negotiate a

truce with him and he traveled with them

for a while until a red dragon attacked

the ship and they were forced to flee

via a teleportation magic and they ended

up in Port lions are ooh

in the jungle continent of Kult and

shortly thereafter artists was

attracting attention from a rival

organization called the Santarem and

thought it would be too dangerous for

him to stay with the party so he and the

ring of winter parted company with the

waffle crew and that's how the waffle

crew came into possession of a new guide

named dragon bait ace Oriole paladin

who's been with them ever since

well they've continued their primary

quest which is to stop this death curse

that is ravaging all of faerun and is

slowly claiming the lives of three

members of the party d/f paltin and

Strix and the only thing that is helping

them fight off the death curse is their

ingenuity and these rings

these two rings that they gone after

evil and made the ultimate sacrifice

way back when anyway long story short

the party was leaving or illunga after

consulting with an Oracle when they

found a wrecked sky ship caught in the

trees of the jungle the remains of a

vessel called the star goddess

it was encased in ice in a sort of

perpetual winter scape in the middle of

this steaming hot jungle and it didn't

take long to realize that the cause of

this snow and devastation was the ring

of winter and as artists once warned you

the ring is a powerful evil artifact and

can take control of its wielder and

that's apparently what it did because

suddenly artists evil artists and the

evil ring attacked the waffle crew and

the waffle crew defeated him the ring

was removed from his corpse the last

thing he said was avenge me Alessandra

and palton wanted to try it on because

palton has long coveted to this ring his

party urged him not to which is why he

did all right

and he ended the last session second

possession technically with you making a

saving throw against the ring trying to

assert its control over you and you

rolled an 18 on your charisma save which

is darn good and enough to resist the

rings hold paltin you can feel this evil

artifact it's like this gnawing at your

psyche trying to get in break in through

a window or door into your brain so it

can take over but you basically shut all

the doors latch all the windows in your

head you bolt you bar at little Majan

Airy chairs under them you pile

furniture in front of them everything

you can to keep this thing out of your

skull and and somehow it succeeds and

now that I don't think that the ring can

get in to your head now at least for a

little bit why do I feel like I know how

to iceberg

you think that really focused yes

given time given like maybe a few

minutes as you gradually attune to the

artifact you will be able to unlock its

abilities and you've seen many of them

in play I throw this in just yell

iceberg and wait patiently alright

please what are the rest of you doing

waiting for his iceberg she's all that

the three of you seen because you saw

him dawn the ring and then kind of frown

a little bit and kind of scowl and a

shiver sort of went through his body but

now he seems kind of cool but impatient

he's now tapping his foot and strikes is

just like readying like a fireball like

she's gonna drop him hey stop he's been

warning this iceberg for a long time

the ring is evil he thought it's fine

look at him he doesn't look evil oh

please yes you're still you right I'll

feel more me when I have an iceberg yes

well could you do you think you could

use it to get rid of all this snow and

ice yeah that would be way more useful

than an iceberg guys but what if the

iceberg iceberg please all right so you

guys are just sort of waiting around now

you also found something in the wreck of

the star goddess

yes a device you know it was in a chest

and it looked like this black mechanical

egg with a dial on one side and a window

on the other and coming out of the

window was a bright luminous arcane

energy yep Arkana check that again at

the moment you need to do some more

research or do something okay to pull

that off do you want to do anything with

it yeah d/f actually does want to

retrieve it if nothing else because it

looks extremely dangerous and the last

thing I need is anyone else to find this

so I want to take it with me

and keep it safe and basically tell

Strix that between the two of us I want

us to study it as much as we can to try

to figure out what this does how it

works and why mostly Strix yeah the the

black egg weighs about 10 pounds but it

was sitting inside a protective

hexagonal chest when you found it we

obviously put there to make it easier to

carry because the chest has ittle

handles on it and things you want to put

it back in the chest or do you want to

keep the egg out of the chest and store

it in some other way how large these

chests it's about a foot wide all around

and about a foot and a half tall so it's

not terribly big it's just kind of it's

a little bit bulky you couldn't fit it

in a backpack yeah I'd be hard to travel

with right we could strap it on evylyn

are you sure about what he was strong

you could take some leather straps and

loop them around the handles of the

chest and turn it into something that

she could wear over her back it would be

a little ungainly but she could manage

it it'll be just like when I used to

carry little baby waffles on my back see

she's strong okay well the the chest

itself Strix you said was warded no

chess reported yes

I don't know like this chess itself is

somehow containing its whatever or okay

well for the time being we'll try to

keep it within the chest if it becomes

too uncomfortable or has too much stuff

okay well dish it and it will take just

the thing itself okay how much does it

weigh me said it's about 15 pounds or 20

pounds all told with the chest and the

egg okay

okay palton you would tuned to the ring

and you just the first thing you

discover is that you can if you want to

use an action to dismiss this winter

effect in the vicinity that you're in

that doesn't use a charge a couple other

things you notice is you learn that the

ring defies attempts to magically locate

it and neither the ring nor its wearer

can be targeted by anything that would

allow it to be scribed like a scrying

sensor or something like that basically

you're off the grid while you're cool

the other thing you know you have is a

bit early called frozen time which is as

long as you wear the ring you don't age

naturally you are also immune to cold

that goes without saying

and you know we have so much in common

now you know that the ring has 12

charges that it regains every dawn so

but 11 of them have been spent today so

you've got one charge now what time is

it it's late afternoon but the getting

rid of the winter effects wouldn't use a

chart that does not use a charge

initiate it creating a winter effect

does but stop ending this ambient effect

does not if you wanted to create another

120 foot radius sphere of winter weather

you could spend a charge and do it so

you didn't do another one if you want to

because you have one charge left in the

ring you also get a ton of spells

out of the ring with one with only one

charge remaining the only spells you can

cast right now or sleet storm which

costs one charge or spike growth which

causes icy spikes to erupt from the

ground

that's another charge everything every

other ability of the ring that I'm not

going to go into right now basically

requires more than one charge so can't

quite iceberg yet yeah you have to wait

till the dawn

that's rough buddy so can I just be like

like fidgeting around with it and I like

accidentally set off like a spike growth

just to see it happen yeah and when you

do basically this field of I see spikes

that Rupp's from the ground and sort of

remains there for a certain span of time

and it looks like if you were to enter

that you might take damage holy I

imagine that it like appears like really

close to strikes okay cool so that does

that yeah what's up can we get rid of

the ice instead of making more I tell

them like oh you see there was only one

charge left on that it's real cold here

i man I mean maybe if the ring had some

convincing yeah it's the ring that's not

what it needs it needs the sweet Naruto

lovin why don't you want to get it looks

real nice Deus why don't you kiss it cuz

palms are dick like that oh well I I

guess it's fine it's not that cold out

right I don't feel it being cold mmm

it's very cold in the in the winter area

it's like minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit

yeah I don't feel it but you know you

walk a few hundred feet you're outside

of it you're in the jungle and it's more

like thirty degrees Fahrenheit just

annoyed and it's just gonna like walk

over to waffles and just be like I don't

know what's happening waffles we're just

gonna stand over here alright waffles

took some damage from the ring of winter

during the altercation

right she is still damaged at this point

Simon is also damaged from the cold and

so is dragon bleep we should rest here

then

yes and this wintry no now that's a

great idea we mix the winter paltin rest

here and maybe brigade some charges

paltin if it wasn't so snowy and cold i

put up a hut around me Wow not only am i

immune achill but now I don't even need

to because it's so warm in here

yeah so a waffle have a magical dome

appears and it's temperature controlled

so you can hang out in there if you want

I go give waffles five points of health

okay I lay on my hands I've scratched

behind her little ears I'm like you feel

better akuto girl you just feel alright

she'll take that Simon will put his hand

his hands on his hips and look at you as

well you go ask your dad your dad your

dad can heal you just fine alright it'll

go off and it's alright alright you

don't have to kiss the ring okay we can

compromise yeah I just I just want to

hear you say that I will become the

Hokage it's fine you don't need to I

just need to hear you say it it would

mean a lot to me I will become the

Hokage all right good enough for me so

how drunk is he right now drunk on power

all right thing your son is asking for

healing heal your son okay I will I will

go help my son okay are you gonna use

the your magical mandolin to do a

healing song absolutely all right

let's see you got a cure wounds a

third-level so bring it so you're gonna

roll some dice for me so that'll be 3 d

8 plus your charisma modifier okey-dokey

3 d 8 plus charisma okay okay that would

be 24 all right he's fine

you he'll not yeah my son okay some time

passes you hibernate in the hot dawn

comes paltin the ring fully recharges

all the charges come back I'd like you

to make another charisma saving feel

okay Oh every day I knew it I knew it

it's fine I'm charming as hell Chris was

not a long rest

everybody gains the benefits of a longer

okay I'd say that's 13 okay everybody

else make perception checks oh my god

once in my life 16 oh wow I got a 19

good 17 all right you all see as dawn

breaks and evil in your in your prayers

your dawn prayers or whatever but not so

distracted that you don't see Paul tans

eyes flash blue in an instant and the

ring glow as well and then he gives you

he sort of scans you all with this look

that

you would think is totally out of

character he's thinking there-there is

the best word I can use is there is a

menace to that look that that has never

crossed his face before but then he

regains his composure and he's fine

during can I give like a more maniacal

just huh yeah no no give it give the

ring now Paulson this is raised for some

iceberg no give it off you can now use

either two charges to create a nice

object or four charges to create an ice

creature that's animated and you want

your iceberg I wait no now I'm thinking

of a different creature since it's that

many come back to me okay yes is that a

saving throw that he's making or a check

that is a saving throw but you don't

know he's making it so Nate if you want

to you could add plus five to that there

you go cool Bono the menacing things

sounded kind of cool I mean if you want

to have been standing next to evylyn

then you can add plus five if you were

off by your own self bench so just just

preemptively

I will am i picking up that like every

day it tries again in like when I like

you know your experience yes that is

absolutely true

okay so I'm going to I'm going to

approach evylyn okay I'm going to be

like now don't read too much into this

but every night I'm going to need to

sleep right next to you I hope that's

okay sure nope no big deal all right

fantastic yeah whatever

okay great I appreciate it I know it's

probably a bit of a burden but you know

five all right great

I mean you said that was plus five plus

five all right cool so everything's plus

nine now I'm into that

yes okay anything else you want to do

before you continue your attractive Omo

did we remove the ice Alden yeah you

want to get rid of it

oh yeah he said he wants to be the

Hokage Strix is also going to try in

just any kind of research she can do on

that egg and downtime between rescue you

you could spend part of the night

studying it study it through the morning

make another check for me or comment

yeah Chris Perkins I've decided what I

want to try and do first with the ring I

would like go ahead sorry it's fine it

does i Burrell too bad I don't know what

it is I would like to create a creature

you said that's how many charges it's

four charges and you can create the

creature can be modeled after a beast

that's basically any animal with a

challenge rating of two or less so that

it does sort of limit things like you

can't make a Tyrannosaurus but you could

make anything that has a CRF two or less

and that would include things like oh I

don't know a baboon a bear a wolf a

crocodile a camel so hypothetically if I

wanted to create an ice Simon Simon is

not a beast oh okay thank God what what

beast is closest to Simon a little

monkey yeah okay I just I want to make

that ice saber-toothed that thing was

pretty good alright if you thought you

can do a saber-toothed tiger made of ice

appears next year like sweet can I ride

it that attacked us earlier pretty much

yeah

rule but it's a friend now you're now on

a nice tiger with big husky fangs all

right I like I like sit on it I look

around like all right guys I'm good just

make a dexterity check for me Christmas

that is that is a that is a slippery

tyre boy that would be a 15 okay you

managed to hang on just fine Dalton you

want to race she jumps up on waffles no

I'm good up here okay all right death

will actually pick up Simon and like

seat it up in his lap oh dear

thank you I know what I said all right

so Simon and palton are riding the ice

tiger and the hand and the hand is also

nice tiger this is great so you know

that the ice tiger will last 24 hours

before it melts into a pool of water so

cool okay come back to me okay so you

leave the star goddess behind you

continue your trek to omou paltin seems

to know the way having been granted a

gift by sahjhan Abaza the guardian naga

of or illunga

and you guys are all go down by another

hitpoint that's DF and paltin your

maximum hit points dropped by 100

strikes to right yep

all three of you and then after a 3 day

trek with paulten creating new ice

animals every day probably

but is he evil he's not evil yet I say

yet I'm gonna have him make another

charisma saving throw I am also next

next to evil enforcement we snuggled

real nice last night also Strix is

constantly ready to just drop it also

does not ask any questions he's like we

need to stay close and she's like okay

and she just cuddles with him not asking

anything so so it's so it's the +5 from

evylyn yeah and then my plus 4 so it's

plus 912 but I don't know why is plus 12

charisma saves oh okay so it's plus so

it's plus 12 okay that's a 13 you were

the one before you even rolled the dice

that's how that's how well I know you

all right paulten does not kill you all

then when do you get to the edge of omen

you realize and Strix might have told

you this already that the city is sunken

into the ground and basically is

surrounded by cliffs on all sides the

city is also within a few tens of miles

from what looks like a volcanic mountain

range and there are volcano and they're

all active volcanoes they spew lava big

big billowing clouds of smoke and and

ash pouring out of them and every once

in a while you can feel the ground

tremble beneath your feet as these

things shudder in the distance oh no

itself as you reach the edge of a cliff

Alton you sort of look to your left you

look to your right and you can see

through the foliage that there is a rift

at one end of this city that you could

descend down in fact it looks like that

rift has stone stairs sculpted into it

leading down

to the city the cliffs are a hundred

feet high this is the place that Strix

has been before right Strix has been

here before she recognized it

immediately what's changed Strix

is you can see one end of the city has

fallen into what appears to be a lava

fissure you didn't you didn't really

notice that before it's not a big it's

not a huge fissure it's not it's only

maybe a tenth of the city that's

consumed by it but there is a lot of

smoke billowing out of it

the biggest thing you notice is that

there appears to be at a glance you

think snow falling what and then you

realize it's not no it's white ash Oh

from the lava or coming from another

walk no it seems to be being carried

miles over the jungle by and coming from

the volcanoes do I see any any airships

or remnants of the AI crew that I use

moment with you do not see at a glance

the airship all right is there a dead

Gorge dinosaur SREC you're not I see the

body of Jim Tariq somewhere make a

perception check so omou is big it's a

monster sized city and you can as you're

staring down into it make out buildings

with raised stone avenues running

between them you can see off on the far

side of the city what appears to be the

palace lying in ruins you're not close

enough and you're not at the right angle

to see the amphitheatre which is where

you descended in the airship and fought

to the feathered Tyrannosaurus

right so you can't see that part of the

city at all you'd have to walk around

about a quarter of the edge of the city

to get to a vantage point where you

could see it all right well I know

that's where it is so I tell everyone

that he died there

all right huh now

so between Strix and paltin you can see

things beyond anything that we can see

we should be able to find some kind of

entrance or something to the underground

area or whatever maybe we can fly down

there oh wait we should we have to we

have to find mr. Fox first right no not

him

just his things as thanks but they are

within all move itself some are deep

underground there's a sort of an image

of the city

lava you're in the bottom-left corner

gotcha oh I see you okay can I get on my

broom and sort of like check around if

we walk down the stairs and see if

there's anything down there just to make

sure the coast is clear

yeah okay I will turn my staff into a

broom and it looks super cool yep I'll

fly down

I think I'll bring it back as you launch

out and your staff turns into a broom

you soar through the air over the city

you can see that vegetation has taken

hold of much of the ruins many of the

buildings have collapsed fallen in roofs

so you can kind of see into their

interiors some of them are sunken in

what appears to be a flooded river that

flows through the city before pouring

into the lava fissure there's all kinds

of life down there that you can see

birds and things but nothing startling

or nothing that immediately leaps out at

you and says danger and for me that

means it looks real safe so I'm gonna

tell everyone that it looks real safe

alright but if there was something like

walking around down there you'd have a

heart unless it was on one of the razed

boulevards you'd have a hard time seeing

it just because there's so much coverage

right well the best at least I checked

so I'll tell her when I checked it and

the stairs that lead down into the city

looks safer than trying to scale the

cliff walls if that were to become a

necessity for someone yeah we're

definitely not gonna scale the cliff

walls I don't think waffles can make

that yeah no not without some sort of

harness oh god just

thought it makes me anxious ya know okay

so you think it's best we take the

stairs yeah we need to take the stairs

all right let's do that I will still

have around my broom though and make

sure everyone is like getting down okay

what's the I don't walk if I can help it

okay keep your eyes in the sky let us

know if you see anything what ice animal

do you have today

Alton Oh God if you could ride it that'd

be real nice hmm

all sigh he doesn't seem like he's into

it so Esther

how about a nice yeah ice rhino okay

you have a nice right nice all right

this is great okay

every time every every time I spot a new

animal I was correctly a deer I'm like

this is great look back at him every

time he's just oh Deanna I said this is

crazy

as you come on everyone you get to the

bottom of the stairs no problem d/f

waffles dragon bait Simon you're all on

foot palton is leaping down the stairs

on his ice rhino he's mastered how to

sit on ice creatures now and evylyn and

and and Strix are sort of zipping around

overhead the buildings that you first

come to are a little bit more spread out

but they look like they've just been

neglected not lived in in centuries if

not millennia and eventually you get

past them into the city proper where you

start to see now stairs leading up to

the raised stone roads which were built

higher than the ground of Cour they're

elevated because the ground could be a

little bit marshy and the buildings next

to them that sort of run alongside these

stone avenues are all dilapidated and

caved in but paltin you know that

scattered throughout the city are a

number of holy shrines you know this

instinctive

from the blessing that was given to you

the three closest ones to you you feel

are about well two of them are about a

hundred yards away one on one side of

the Avenue one on the other the other

one you think is on that pillar over the

lava fissure there's a there's a pillar

of rock that rises up it'll have a

fissure with a six on it you see that

that's yeah that's one of the shrines it

looks like all the ground fell away from

it but somehow the shrine managed to not

fall into the lava that's cool

anywho that's what you see and then I'd

like everybody make perception checks

natural twenty-nine I'm too stoked on

the fact that I have a nice get it all

on your system okay it's completely

distracted all right well apparently a

rhino riding is very distracting and

strix what did you roll I got a nine

okay and evil and you didn't do much

better right I got 15 oh that's better

okay

evylyn and DF you see someone bolt out

of a vine-covered ruin he is a gaunt

thin man with leathery brownish skin

bald with sort of a patchy beard and

he's got dirt stained red robes and he's

just sort of wild-eyed and you notice DF

that he's got an arrow sticking out of

his back up by the left shoulder and

that he's got another arrow clean

through his right leg and he's still

running but neither of those wounds

seemed to have discouraged him from

running in terror toward you and he says

he's mad he's gonna kill us all and then

an arrow comes through his mouth and he

falls to the ground oh let us help you

I immediately tell everyone to take

cover from the direction of the arrows

and hide behind whatever okay I imagine

Strix is like 15 feet off the ground and

goes and erster broom just turns back

into her staff and she's collapsed

alright yes Strix falls into a bush

evylyn tries to go grab the wounded man

and drag him to safety

alright as evylyn swoops down at the man

who has fallen onto the ground

what dude deaath and palton do I'm on

this Rhino that's like a bucking bronco

I'm just like I hide behind said Rhino

okay it's not you it's moving a lot but

okay it's like one of those mechanical

bolts you know you have a little control

over this Rhino if you're really it's

enough to give me cover or something as

we trying to try to like scan my eyes to

see exactly where that arrow came from

alright with Matthew could you make a

stealth check for me my greatest role

okay okay see what's going on and

there's a rhino and there's a woman

trying to help an obviously dead man and

I'll say to him Carlos from where you

drop you all not exactly trying to here

so what you see is the speaker it's sort

of that sort of sprung from a rooftop to

a rooftop to a rooftop and landed on

sort of the remains of a crumbling wall

is now staring at you this bipedal cat a

a feline humanoid wearing leather armor

and a crown of fern leaves and he's got

a big bow and what looks like a quiver

full of arrows over his back have we

ever seen a person like this before I'm

pretty sure I have you have Strix

because you ran into a couple of them in

Portland's aru these are this is a two

back see but no one no one else has seen

one I'll just like peek through the

bushes like from the ground

yeah sideways and just be like I've seen

I've seen them there they're bad news

they're cats

Oh kitty also I would like to crawl

towards the dead fair enough I say again

state your business I'm just trying to

you know stabilize this poor man who

seems to have an arrow through his face

yeah he's already dead when you turn him

over at DeLand you can see he's dead

he's like beyond death saves he's beyond

souls gonna be taking strikes has

crawled up to him at this point and is

going through his ropes so she's like

that arrow Lance DF will respond back

that's enough

state your business first are you some

kind of protector of the city

I think it is interesting you ask a

question based on my question just you

answer mine first before I give you your

heads I mean to be fair that was a

little derivative do you even come on we

only seek the lost city of Omo you are

founded we are here to deliver of which

you seek I do okay I do a hood deception

check okay

[Music]

17:17 your insight check math you would

be your wisdom would be a wisdom check

for you plus three and I'll stream my

bow my hands will go to the sky and I'll

go up to ice rhino and try like an

animal handling I'll try to calm your

beast alright this rare exotic beasts

like nothing I've ever seen in my life

get more mesmerized by that I'm worried

about you for you can absolutely make an

animal handling check if you want yeah

17 okay you think that that should be

enough to tame this wild beast but then

as you are attempting to comment you

realize there's nothing natural about

this creature whatsoever it's more

construct than beast and doesn't seem to

be affected at all by your animal

handling maneuv moves you think that

it's it's unpleasant uncontrol unnatural

totally on that alright as this is

happening have I can I see a dead person

is

possibly what I think it is which is a

red wizard so the dead man kind of

looked like this oh he's not a red

wizard he's just a dead dude but you can

see that he he has over him a red robe

that looks like the same colors as what

you expect a red wizard to wear but it's

sort of ill-fitting and underneath that

he's just got this leather jerkin and

trousers a simple band around his head

but you do notice that he has got a book

tucked away he's not very good with

those arrows is he this is all the time

here can I have this book again if I

tell you why we're here can I have this

book please she said please usually they

do the fountain of training he grabs the

gold band off the tag puts it in the bag

okay yeah so this is now state your

business

we're here to stop bras nici Spee if

you've been here long enough then you

know as well as we do that there is more

to Omo than what we see here yeah would

you stop Roz Nietzsche when when they

say razz me see you know the name

immediately Roz nisi is a you wan T

warlord who lives in the city and

commands the the serpent people here

nothing would make me happier than to

stop this evil creature great we're on

the same side takes the book so you did

an order in ice right now okay I'm just

gonna have it startled back in jump back

a back loop under that wall again and

just look at him like he's a frickin

pager yeah

I'm just like yeah this is strong I

could show you to Rodney's here this is

what you see so long as you two are an

enemy of him that's always always sick

if we can ruin the land of his light

there's but the first step but bringing

pieces people and ourselves this boon

would be very dangerous and it would be

an honor to die in its claws hopefully

no dying no dying well I mean if we're

gonna go within you know past records

you know sure no dying no more dying

deaths do you look back at the party and

kind of give him a a single nod Chris

backseat warrior if I feel like he's

actually leading us correctly or these

Estrella are trying to possibly bring us

to a trap or something you don't know I

see that slight hesitation acknowledging

you as the leader I'll flip back off my

wall I'll flip out like a small male on

my arm and I'll cut myself open and I'll

present it to you and I'll grab your arm

and I'll cut your arm open like

Wow doc doing magic

of those little nature spirits I

immediately start going toward it okay

creature with a white mask and he he

holds out a nut for you oh thanks buddy

see the do we see what he's interacting

with nope he just leaves me down on the

ground thinking like just looking at

be sure that our blade strike true right

to the heart of rest nice bag of nails

bag of nails now MDF Woodrow can we call

woman is evil in over there's tricks and

Paulding he's like off in the corner he

started walking toward you looking in

like a bun something he found which he's

got in his hand Dan and that that's

Politan guys really important I didn't

mean to interrupt

we have nuts do it everyone taken that

it's really important takes it like

immediately all right no we're supposed

to eat it okay bottom just sort of grabs

the other ones and waits and just sort

of watches Strix for about a minute sees

I think like still chewing all right

Strix you feel like some magical effect

has taken hold of you no good or good or

bad you can make an arc on it check to

ascertain what it might be yes you know

that these you call them Chingiz these

little nature spirits that haunt MO and

the greater jungle and they are known

for being inoffensive creatures who take

a shine to people for strange reasons

and often give them little gifts or

magical charms

I got a twenty one with a twenty one you

can ascertain that what's been the spell

that has been cast on you is basically a

resist poison spell oh oh oh oh you tell

us that eat eat them they make you not

be poisoned do we want to know I mean I

don't know if you want it now but I ate

mine and I feel like I won't be poisoned

well some of mine cuz I can't be

poisoned do we know like how long that

lasts sir

you're not sure okay maybe we'll hold on

to it but daddy my butt bag of nails you

know that you want e the snake people

use poison weapons

you should eat no oh okay let's eat it

now here you go dear are we from from

where this guy would be oh so you

believe that there is an entrance into

the you want a stronghold which is a

dungeon under the city in the ruins of

the old royal palace so that's it that's

a trek across with a far side of the

city which for you based on the routes

you know you can get there in about an

hour okay so yeah so we could be we and

with the with the you MTB either the

monks the city yes so you you've been

really really good at sort of in

figuring out how they move about because

they have eyes and spies everywhere but

you want to you discovered have the

ability to turn into ordinary snakes and

it is in that form that they move

through the city surreptitiously they

spy on intruders and then just assume

their true form is an attack usually

gaining the element of surprise so

you're very wary of serpents acting

strangely you're moving in groups okay

okay good to know

Pelton can I have my nut after all oh

okay sure think even like cracks it like

a nutcracker but she doesn't eat it and

she gives it to waffles alright alright

so waffles has the poison resistance

anybody else a whole lot of mine until

we start getting yeah Chris question

does Simon's the Simon's gesture had

have a have a bell on it yeah so I'm

gonna pick up Simon and like walk over

to bag of nails

mmm-hmm and just kind of start jingling

it so yes he holds up this Marius

oh this is going so much better than

play have a cat friend to my bag and I

take out this little ball of yarn

Simon takes the little ball of yarn and

then he just sort of turns his head

right around to you paltin and gives you

this look like what the okay easier

okay realize that he could be slipping a

little is that the edge of like he's

like a little old Simon goes limp it's

like the Grail is whiskers and there's

something kind of like old and sad about

this oh it's like I think Simon has two

dads now sorry three dads now sorry do

you dragon bait will hold out his hand

to you palton for a nut see oh yeah

you're here here you go man sorry and

steal the bell and immediately start

running down the everyone let's go the

longer we wait the longer the worstest

kiss and as we start moving with bag of

nails kind of leaned the way yeah kinda

looks back at the rest of the party

shows us forearms kind of goes evil like

real quick just Pat it Pat like one hit

point into it to make it better okay

yeah Hoyt rolls feedback down pulls the

ball up just like all right as you make

your way now bag of nails does not walk

along the main

thoroughfares he basically needs between

yeah sorry I'll go I'll take the high

road and go from like this plop the

rooftop keeping my eyes peeled yeah yeah

I could like a pace I'll be about 30

feet in front of them watching or great

yeah I could do that if I wanted to I

just don't know the way okay so the rest

evylyn and Strix are you staying close

to the ground are you going high since

you I will be flying yeah I'm always

flying I don't want to be by any snakes

how high up do you want to be I'm not

gonna be I'll be at rooftop level kind

of like as bag of nails is jumping I'll

be level with him okay and palton are

you on foot now can I make lichen like

an ice cat that I can ride yeah I guess

I'd be like a sabertooth yeah

yeah okay cool yeah you spend another

four charges leaving you with four

charges in the ring and you get your ice

saber-toothed tiger whoa oh and Simon

will you pull him up as well and hit him

right along with you dragon big little

up the rear with waffles Darren's face I

stopped my tracks

yeah absolutely

yeah and he stops and jumps down and

smells that things but like oh yeah okay

yeah you do there's no yeah there's no

no smell coming off of whatsoever it's

literally and made of ice just as

unnatural as the ice rhino it's hardly a

pleasurable experience as you leap

across the rooftops you come to an area

where there aren't any more rooftops to

leap onto there is a shrine with a low

wall around it to one side and then

there's this sort of absolutely rampant

overgrown vine garden in sort of this

marshy but you can leap onto the wall

and kind of run across the wall of the

shrine if you want to stay above the

ground bag of nails just be like a cat

on a broken wall basically yeah

unlike making athletics check yeah

shouldn't be a problem 17 yeah you're

good

so yeah you see bag of nails springing

along a wall that runs alongside

one of the shrines of Omo and you can

see the motifs in the wall bear images

of or bar reliefs and sculptures of what

looked like a cheetah or leopard with

snakes coming out of its shoulders and

those are sort of in inset and

protruding from the walls of this shrine

I think I remember that lovely snort

Elling us a little bit about something

like that

the trickster gods yeah yeah it does

look like one of the representations of

one of the trickster gods right as

you're making your way along and see

that the the vine garden has a few

shattered pillars kind of erupting from

it and they've been sort of broken off

or sheared off and their top ends lie

toppled on the ground and completely

overgrown and they're just sort of

broken off at weird angles but I'd like

everybody to make a perception check to

see if you notice anything 18 very good

also 18 Wow okay okay everybody

everybody sees that on top of one of

these pillars there is a perched and it

is a giant four-armed gargoyle

oh no we're good against these it's fun

yeah we're not I'm not and you know that

it's not just statuary because its head

sort of follows you and it it's wings

are pulled in tight it doesn't look like

it's taking off it's just gripping the

top of this shattered pillar with its

clawed feet and sort of watching

well no harm no foul if you don't want a

tussle then that's fine probably a good

choice on your end gargoyle bag of nails

do you know anything about this I am NOT

playing around with a gargoyle and he

you see him he grabs his bow and takes

two shots

what all right twelve here we go this is

kind of what the creature looks like oh

no that looks all right

so make your make your attack rolls so

your two attacks and there's no - on the

second attack correct correct

so 16 and a 29 or the 29 is definitely

gonna hit and the 6 the 16 is going to

shatter against his stony hide but not

penetrate so a big one hit okay take

stand by okay

take 14 okay as the first shot strikes

the gargoyle and basically takes a large

chip out of it you see that seems to

incur its anger and then its rings

unfurl and I'd like everybody to roll

initiative 18 18 for evylyn 15 first

tricks okay 15 for balton 21 for DES and

bang I'm looking for my looking for oh

that would be here dexterity bonus

attitude is a 24 okay great

bag of nails you're going to get to go

again before anyone else right okay

excuse me nope Alton first ones immense

and the second one is a 23 that is going

to hit you she died whitening marrow

he's cooler wanted yes I said I'm

something you could have his arrow

transform his arrow transforms into a

bolt of lightning in mid transit alright

so you do 48 with that right or

additional da yep

that's 15 and then the lightning is 48

yep so it's 14 plus 15 20 25 30 one damn

it holy smokes alright yeah so that

lightning just blows a large chunk of

the gargoyle but it's still intact I'll

take my move action and find parcel

coverage yeah you can sort of drop down

behind the wall that you're on yeah bye

ciao okay so after starting that fight

and then ducking for cover a bag of

nails drops out of view except of course

evylyn strikes you can see him because

you're airborne DF what do you do so

gargoyle homeboy still like up on this

wall he's up on the pillar pretty high

up

yeah the pillar it puts him about 20

feet off the ground now there are there

are some vines and things growing around

the outside of the pillar and there's

some carvings on the pillar that make it

climb a bowl whoo I'm gonna climb not up

to gargoyle instead I will similar to

two bag of nails I will also find

something representing cover oh yeah and

then I'll use my action to take the

defensive defense action got it now I'll

wait for the guardrail to act first all

right

evylyn what do you do after a bag of

nails launches a flurry and

of arrows one of which is lightning at

this creature and it's very clear that

the gargle is coming after us now that

gargoyle looks plenty pissed well

alright I mean I haven't smashed

anything today I just go for it with

tree bane okay am i close enough that I

can easily get there and do my two

attacks yes cool fly up there swinging

tree Bane that's a 25 a 25 is it's sweet

and I do uh seven damage with that one

good and then one more hits

hopefully nope probably not that's a

fourteen that bounces off its stony hi

alright um the gargoyle goes next and

since he's got a foe rate in front of it

it is going to attack you evil and don't

worry about it guys I got this it's

actually with a bite and four claws

that's fine that's that's too many

attacks so bite is a crit so that's

going to be the bite does 25 points of

damage to you and then of the four claws

only one of them hits you and it does

nine slashing damage okay you said

twenty five and nine and goal slashing

the bite is piercing so twenty-five

piercing nine slashing for a total of

thirty-four that's its turn paltin you

know you see evylyn fluttering up next

to a gargoyle that's on top of a 20-foot

high shattered pillar even they're

duking it out

so bad don't worry just they say how

many charges on the ring do I have left

you have four I have for us what I

thought yeah

can I try to do the thing that had

frozen me before to it that had thrown

something frozen yeah frozen to a statue

come on to the colder so okay so yes you

can do a Big B's ice hand which creates

this ghostly ice hand that squeezes and

crushes things that's two charges or you

can blast a cone of cold which is two

charges which is what he hits you with

that froze you you can do flesh to ice

which is three charges but it turns a

creature to ice you can do an ice storm

which is a wide-area effect you probably

don't want to do that you can do but

that's basically it so the cone of cold

is basically what zapped you last time

okay okay and that had the chance to

freeze right if it dropped them to zero

yeah oh okay but it does it does eight D

eight cold damage okay I'm gonna do that

and I call out like alright guys ready

to start a blizzard all right so Paul

Tain's eyes glow blue as he holds out

his hand and a cone of cold energy

erupts from it you can you can shift the

cone so it doesn't hit evil and just

catches the gargoyle yeah without a ring

all right the gargoyle failed it safe so

it's gonna take all 88 nice all 88 okay

okay I need to do some math here so

[Music]

always good okay still got two more oh

good okay okay all right okay so fifty

holy Wow all right after it gets

absolutely blistered by this cone of

cold you can see that it's got this icy

casing around it and the pillar is all

sort of frozen as well and then it just

sort of breaks out of the ice and is

still alive but it looks very very badly

hurt in fact it's so cold it's skin is

all it's it's flesh has all got these

cracks in it that weren't there before

even's never seen paulsen deal that much

damage in a single throw or at least she

hasn't in a while and so she sees this

and she's like dang

[Music]

hit with the icy hot yeah and it looks

quite hurt at this point strix europe

stretch was really mad that Paulson's

trying to like steal her magic thunder

she's like so she's gonna go at it I

guess just fireball it careful spell I

was the same level as usual not not that

era so after the ice blast goes off this

huge plume of flame erupted surround the

pillar completely engulfing it but

sculpt it around

evylyn so it doesn't touch her and it's

got to make another saving throw it

rolled a six so it fails annihilated 31

all right

the fireball blows it to pieces and bag

of nails is you sort of peer through a

hole in the wall and and watch this

spectacle you realize that that fireball

and that ice blast were so great chances

are good everybody in the city knows

you're here yeah mid bits of the

gargoyle sort of dope and just sort of

land all around you these splintered

pebbles and shards of the creature I

a claw lens right beside you

paltin sort of and then stops I'll go to

paltin and immediately start licking his

face Thank You cat dad okay as we're

like running like I'll turn this tricks

and be like hey it's pretty cool how

like now we have like two powerful magic

casters right just use my girl she's

like for a minute yeah we're headed

there strict like the magic on your

broom cuts out to focus on it again to

get it started and it kind of backfires

and lets off this huge burst of smoke

just stomps past and of course that the

backfire descends all these birds and

the trees up everywhere two cans and

parents flying all around you yes and

you're all following a bag of nails as

he leads you down back ways DF you sort

of step in some one looks like dinosaur

poo and you scrape it off your boot and

of course I do continue to make your way

along too many books bag of nails I

don't need you to make any check you're

able to lead them to a river that flows

through the city this is an accidental

River there was never originally a river

through Omo but when it sank one of the

rivers that sort of fell into the canyon

kind of formed and flowed through parts

of the city flooding it you're gonna

have to you've sort of taken them to a

section that you know very well where a

log has fallen over the

span and you can cross it easily you've

cross it a hundred million times you

leap across that they follow you across

at those who are on foot waffles pulling

up the rear and that takes you to

another broken Avenue with buildings on

either side of it and lots of back alley

ways that you can take them to try to

stay out of sight you're very close now

to the outermost Palace wall the palace

was a big circle your series of circular

walls and many of which have great

gashes in them where they've fallen and

collapsed but you're close enough now

that you can see the wall looming up

through the falling ash and it looks

like the the ash is continuing to fall a

kind of a slow almost pretty pace and is

just starting to accumulate on the

ground maybe like a centimeter is worth

I'm gonna take a perception check my ET

tracks absolutely especially snakes in

that case make a make a survival check

Wow he's smart thank you for being here

okay you do see now the the you on T

tend to stay off the the raised roads

and you're not surprised that you don't

see much of there but yeah in the area

where you are you can see slithery marks

through the ash signifying that there

are you want he close by sure a heck do

I have a sense I mean not and not

surprisingly this close to the palace

they have patrols and you can actually

count with your roll you think you make

out what looks like four distinct sets

of tracks okay I do that I'm evil crime

crime evil awareness yeah yeah so you

can use this if you if you

use a level of the spell like a spell

slot you can determine creatures within

a mile of you aberration Celestials

dragons elementals Fae fiends no really

what we're looking at here you want to

you know or not of any of those types

after bag of nails points out the Yankee

tracks can I make a mental note or kind

of quick memorization of what those

tracks look like so I could potentially

look for that in the future yeah

absolutely

great continue but be ready and pull it

and start to move slowly okay stay

behind me I'll scan for similar tracks

alongside bag of nails as he continues

to lead us dome idea which I want to do

I remember

the Arias snake girlfriend correct there

any way that I could do alter self to

make myself look like said snake

girlfriend

yeah the alter self spell the the

difference between a human or a tiefling

and a you want a pureblood which look

basically human except for some subtle

serpentine features is not hard to pull

off with the style so alright that's

what I'm gonna do okay so you turn into

a you want a snake woman and I'm gonna

look at everyone be like if they see us

you're my prisoners that's so smart

you're so smart Strix oh woe is me

I have been captured here still dressed

like Strix but you're sneaky

no alright yeah as I see them like like

readying like getting like you know

ready for whatever is coming I like hop

off the sabre-tooth and I ready to and I

like just aggressively like take out my

mandolin perception checks and you all

have advantage because bag of nails

warning and pointing out the tracks but

with her new alter self dia thing Strix

looks gross

I got on the wagon : l distracted by the

ante with us that I see now I got a six

with advantage I got 13 alright paltin

you alone actually dragon base not

surprised either you and dragon bait are

not surprised when you can see in the

ruins and buildings around you shapes

that you take to be serpentine in nature

obviously they are aware of you but do

you want to say anything when you see

them like looks like this they look like

half serpent Half Men creatures with

bows and scimitars I quietly warn my

party this I'm like I'm also not

surprised by them at all with Bolton's

warning none of you are surprised when

six you want to appear and you can see

that they are unlike Strix they're not

they're not just humans with serpentine

features two of them I'm sorry four of

them actually have like snake heads full

on and then the other two look like they

have human heads and human upper bodies

but instead of legs they have a big long

Serpent's tail also gross yes my snake

brother do any of these look like those

who attacked us back in port neons aru

when I was almost poisoned to death on

the roof you know it's really hard to

say the you don't think you've seen

these ones specifically no okay one of

the ones with the human

heads appears to be the leader you can

see that she's got this sort of high

gold collar on and her hair is most

Daved except for like five top knots

that sort of hang down long and she's

got gold rings kind of looped through

these her braided hair and when she sees

you she says oh yes are my prisoners

hiss make a deception check you really

selling it just for flavor the little

song I've been playing is a little extra

inspiration to make you more convincing

[Laughter]

just like you just like her hair comes

back onto like the snake the snake head

oh yeah yeah same I already did

me too wait no I didn't I don't need to

twenty-three

one two three four bag of nails 14 I got

a 7 7 14 yes it's 13 13

another NAT 2000k bag of nails you're

gonna be the first to go where we I

absolutely stand terrain so you manage

to get a sort of cross over the

boulevard into the between what looks

like a quad of four buildings you're

kind of in the courtyard or what used to

be a courtyard with building with these

four buildings on the corners these one

storey buildings have all fallen into

ruin but the you aunty were hidden there

and they've all sort of come out of

those buildings so imagine if you will a

square enclosed walled area

with buildings in each corner just fall

into ruin and the you want er coming out

of those and you're kind of in the

middle of that square all them all for

you can a deathtrap right yeah actually

they are not coming out of the one

building that you would have left over

to basically land into the courtyard so

there's one building behind you that

appears to be clear but to each have

emerged from the three other buildings

making six altogether okay

find the closest pack to us

my volley my volley attack is a ranged

attack so any number within 10 feet are

they I think yeah two of them are within

10 feet of each other so you've been hit

by both two attacks against each are

just one against each so the way your

volley works is you can use your action

to make a ranged attack against any

number of creatures within 10 feet of a

point you can see within range you make

a separate attack role for each target

two shots against one guy right it's one

of the human head ones assuming it's a

spellcaster okay alright so same attack

against that person oh my one of the

human head ones is the leader the one

who just barked out at you do you want

her to be the target sure okay my 21 and

18 both hits and then 16 26 total okay

jump on top of that building nice kind

of give a battle cry excellent even

tries to join in he does have a hairball

Paul

you see bag of nails get off the two

shots both into the lead the leader you

want to and then do the back flip up to

the roof and start screaming like cat

caterwauling in fact so this leader one

yeah well is that one of the uh she's

one of the human headed ones with the

snake bodies would that be considered

humanoid she none of these you want to

you're considered humanoid they're on

straw cities okay

it's like you knew exactly why I was

asking okay I wanna I want to do that

that ice hand and like grab one of them

okay also does my that's my ice

saber-toothed get to make an attack at

some point you can command it to

absolutely but you have to use an action

to do so I'd like to imagine that

Spaulding's actual thought process I'm

going to do that ice so you can either

do the ice hand or you can command it to

attack as an action your choice I'm

actually gonna command it to attack

first

alright do you have a target in

particular like nearest you aunty the

leader

let's go leader alright then nice in

that case I would like you to roll for

your saber-toothed tiger that would be

now you can use the pounce

action which means you can run toward it

then pounce at her and force her and

then make a claw attack against her so

add six to your d20 role okay

[Music]

that would be a 21 okay that is going to

hit her now she has to make a saving

throw she does not which means your

tiger knocks her prone screech and now

you can now that you've knocked her

prone you can also made a bike a bite

attack against her so roll another d20

and add six okay that would be a sixteen

that's also a hit

so now roll damage for the claw which is

2d six plus five

okay so that is 12 okay and now all

damage for the bite which is one d ten

plus five oh eight ten weird okay plus

five yes fifteen fifteen okay

she is very very very badly bloodied by

is still alive I call out to Sabretooth

I'm like about Jeremy do you want

to you going next

she even though she's down she's going

to cast the spell on you palton and she

is going to say surrender and I need you

to make a wisdom saving throw sorry yeah

lisbon saving throw oh that is an

unnatural 20 okay i just like no she

plants a suggestion in your mind to

surrender and you refuse her companion's

that's badass yeah strips you are

targeted by one archer who shoots you

twice hitting you once with a poisoned

arrow oh no I have poison resistance

she's next to me no you take six points

of piercing damage from the arrow and

only half damage from the poison so

that's three points of poison for a

total of nine

all right evylyn you are targeted by one

of the archers and both miss you on the

bracers Wonder Woman style my cat just

sat on my character she's Simon is

attacked by two arrows one of them

sticks in him he's not affected by

poison but he does take five points of

piercing damage and he just sort of

takes it it kind of sticks right in his

chest

and then he just sort of looks down in

it you see it's sort of created a crack

down his and then you see his eyebrows

lower Tom waffles is targeted by another

one and is hit once with a poison arrow

she chews got the poison resistance so

she takes nine piercing damage and three

poisoned image bag of nails one of the

archers shoots up at you missing with

one attack and rolling a twenty on the

second attack yes all right so you are

hit for eight piercing damage and you

take half the poison damage which is

three as well so a total of eleven

anyone near me and then finally the last

Archer you're flying or two Edelen yeah

now last one will go after dragon bait

and miss him twice so that's it for the

yuan T and that brings us to evil and

arrows just went by and E it was just

like yep and then evil and you can see

one of the UM T is down with the

saber-toothed tiger looming above her

the other human headed snake body to you

on T E is standing next to her with

arrow or a bow and then the four which

have the serpent heads and the human

bodies are over in the other by the

other buildings

I'm gonna go for the ones that are

engaged with the saber-tooth Tiger

because I perceive those to be the

leaders right they yeah it looks like

okay yeah so do you want to try to

attack the one that's on the ground or

the the second one who hasn't been

attacked yet the one who's on the ground

is pretty severely wounded right like

she's not long for this world so I'll

let the tiger finish her all Jeremy

excuse me

Jeremy finish her and I'll go for the

standing one with the bow okay with tree

bane and 15 is a hit

sweet I'm also going to use divine smite

so we've got let's see oh these are

horrible these are the most horrible

rolls 12 okay that's her first attack

yeah

and then I come at it again ooh that's

nice that is a 25 oh yes

and I'm gonna divide sprite again the

Holy Land of Hope and er compels you 21

oh all right those two hits are enough

to bloody him so he's lost half as it

points at least and and your fluttering

right in his face now DF you have so far

been ignored I could do what is

reasonably within range of me of all

these different foes so the archers are

the the forest snake-headed archers are

about 20 25 feet away from you okay are

they like up on walls or they just now

they're on the ground okay great I want

to go after one of the archers okay

they're all technically archers but well

gage not the leaders mistakes okay I'm

gonna go after one of the lesser ones

I'm just kind of giving my target so

they can't use that poison bow right and

just come in

coming up at them and just sort of

slashing away great so just just an

attack I suppose mm-hmm yeah 23 that's

hit great engine 7 damage okay yes so he

takes that wound and it's still alive

and both of those guys are now focusing

on you all right the next step is

waffles annoyed that she was shot by the

bow she is going to come over and be

next to UDF yeah yeah give him girl yep

she's going to attack the one that you

attacked hitting it twice

good girl yeah with her claws 214 and

her bite it's just 12 Chris you have to

do the Alber noise thank you all right

yeah and that one is now bloody ah next

up is Simon murder bot he will

evylyn the one that you're fighting a

little darts gonna come that guy's way

all right Simon hits the you aunty with

the dart now the auntie is immune to

poison so sadly Simon's attack does one

point of damage he's a good boy good job

good job

yep okay and then we drop to Strix look

at Lenny Utley at paulten yeah

Owen mill cask careful spell Kota Colt

on all the yachty well she they're not

all within the range of the car I like

this though all of you can you get oh go

foot long cone you can get

one two you can get four of them

including either the 2d áthis fighting

plus the two that evylyn in in Paul

tenor fighting or you can get the two

that evil and and Paul Turner fighting

and then the two that have not been

engaged in melee at all hmm wood fire

ball get all of them no okay could I

miss you step into a position where I

could get possibly more than two you can

get like I said you can get four of them

oh four okay all right well if I can get

four or fine okay I'm still gonna look

at Paul 10 poignant Lee do you want to

catch the ones that death and waffles

are fighting or the ones that haven't

been engaged yet I will get the ones

that deaath and waffles are fighting all

right then roll your damage and I'll

make my city gross you're a cone of coal

just wraps around all of your allies

avoiding them as it blasts the wanti and

that's 8 d 888 37 good grief alright

deaath one of you are you on T is killed

the other bad blistered bloodied you

might say and both of the human headed

you on T that Evelyn and Paul Turner

fighting are now frozen solid we both

can do that you guys make such a good

team

there are now three you wan t left alive

one fighting death and waffles and two

that haven't been attacked yet and that

was it is dragon baits turn he's gonna

rupture the two that have an attack yet

and hit them with his holy sword he's

gonna hit one twice and he is they are

not fiend or Undead okay so he hits one

twice

bag of nails top of the round I don't

want any escape I'll take I'll shoot the

one that's on the app and use that +8

cuz he's below as Max I got a 20 not

natural

okay that's it so that's 15 plus 19

damage 15 plus 19 or 19 told okay

if you drop no he's still alive I'll

take my other shot on the same 117 you

kill it nice yeah that just sort of

flies off to the side from the sheer

force of the arrow okay I'll stand next

to my son yeah thank backside

alright are you talking about me no he's

talking about Simon okay so the only two

left are the ones that dragon bait is

fighting and it is Paul toons turn so

the one the saber-tooth was on her

Jeremy was on is now dead

correct frozen solid gotcha frozen bikes

tricks his spell is there is there

anything near well about 20 feet away

within charging pouncing distance is are

to that dragon bait is single-handedly

holding off okay let's go for the

nearest one okay make another claw

attack for me as you pulse okay so that

was nice it here so for the attack will

is due to the +6 got it

that is a 13 that's a hit oh so roll 2d

six plus five damage for the fall okay

[Music]

fourteen

okay he is still alive but bloodied but

he is knocked prone because he failed

his strength saving throw so you can now

make a bite attack with advantage roll

to D 20 and take a higher result cool

that's pretty good

19 that's it roll 1 1 d 10 plus 5 damage

for the bite ok hmm

11 all right it is still alive but very

badly hurt

Jeremy at this point in time I'd like

everybody to make perception checks

[Music]

strikes got 17 good did you say with

advantage no just regular you're just

hearing what you want to hear it I don't

I I weirdly just rolled to D twenties

well that's cheating I'll just take the

lower result which is still pretty good

14 okay

24 what for okay those of you who rolled

a 17 or higher raise your hand

excellent you're all dead over the din

of battle and the chaos in this

courtyard which is just outside of the

Royal Palace of omou as through the

falling ash that falls like snow from

the darkened sky you see a shape a

descending down from above so big as to

seem almost beyond measure its wingspan

probably about a hundred and twenty to a

hundred and fifty feet across the

biggest red dragon you've ever seen in

your life and when it realizes it has

been seen it says it is still about a

hundred and eighty feet up in the sky

but it looks it's not close enough you

could practically touch it I'll raise my

bow above my head

[Music]

[Laughter]

[Laughter]

is your turn I oh I'm sorry no it's

co-ed skip you auntie oh great so do you

want tea when they start serious they

look at this

yeah they sort of poop themselves and

turn into snakes and begin to slither

off but that will provoke a not be from

dragon bait he hits one of them it's

your fault yeah so those two snakes

slither away and kind of disappear into

the rubble of the nearest building

leaving you alone with this behemoth

and now evil and what do you do as Klaus

descends upon you Klaus wasn't a big

deal get imagine why he'd be here we

should go is he looking at anyone in

particular Chris you can make a

perception check to ascertain that or

insight if you prefer I definitely

prefer insight thank you

seventeen palton he's looking at palton

can't imagine why he'd be looking at me

evylyn slaps waffles on the run she's

like go get to cover everyone get to

cover and she tried to tries to fly up

in front of the dragon you're almost not

heard over the sound of that

so you're just going for cover is that

what you're doing

no I'm sending them to cover and trying

to that's a free draw the attention how

do you want to do that I want to because

right now the dragon's Terminator like

sights are set on the guy with the ring

great friend we welcome you to this

place I'm so good to see you I'm trying

if you don't remember me I'm evylyn and

I just think it'd be so great to sit

down and have a talk I'm trying to

persuade him to engage with me and not

attack us okay make a persuasion check a

disadvantage this is Chris Perkins it's

a dragon for you 16 okay

I'll let you you can't ascertain

anything right away nothing is gonna

change until his turn comes around DF

what do you do as evylyn pleads to the

dragon for negotiation D immediately

turns towards a bag of nails like with

the most urgent sense of like danger and

panic not not quite panic but just a

sense of urgency within his eyes just

says the entrance how close is it give

me a sense Chris where we are okay I can

do that

so just past this courtyard is the wall

of the palace and the reason you came

this way as you know there's a fissure

in the wall that you can slip through

which will lead you into the interior of

the palace which is kind of set up like

a maze and you haven't been there inside

the palace a whole lot so you know the

configuration of the maze is gonna take

a little bit of reckoning to get through

it was designed this way of course so

that it armies attack the palace they'd

get lost inside the walls and be picked

off but assuming you can get through the

maze inside the walls that will take you

to the center of the palace which has

this collapsed ruined Palace in it and

therein lies the entrance to the Avanti

lair in terms of raw distance it's only

about I want to say 600 feet from where

you're standing to

ruined palace but then there's all these

the walls in the maze and everything in

between you I'll relay that and I'll say

make your way

I will hold off this is a red drip you

got it that's a good plan yeah

d/f will immediately call towards

everyone else and basically say like

we're going we're so close we have to

get inside once we're deep underground

he won't get to us come on and then just

full sprint make it making sure everyone

is coming with okay so you bolt and it

looks like Simon waffles and dragon

Bader of a similar mind but it's not

their turns yet and strix what do you do

I mean I I just like Kermit run I've

already I've already I mean I'm so

you're on the ground I was in the bushes

on the ground yet so I have to stand up

from the bushes with like twigs Eric

yeah and if I see deaath running yes and

waffles everyone running I'm gonna

follow them but I'm also gonna look back

at evil a Napolitan and being like

please come please yeah

now you and you and the rest of you know

that there aren't a lot of places to

hide from an aerial creature because the

rooftops have mostly caved in you're

basically got walls and that's it

but so running doesn't do any good

that's what you're saying no if the

creature is directly above you I mean

you know what I mean can I bonus action

lie on the ground and cry you can yes

yes absolutely I'm on the ground crew

all right dragon bait comes by and picks

you up turn and just hope he's strong

enough to just carry you over your

shoulder while you're crying and weeping

he follows dear what does he smell like

oh that's a very good question

he smells like so dragon dragon bait you

understand communicates with smells yep

believe you're looking it up Chris I am

no it's something I wrote down so I

didn't have to remember he smells like

ham okay nervousness and worry

Pam is the smell of fear

all right so hungry all right waffles

will go long behind you frantically

trying to keep up well actually having

no trouble keeping up Simon will have a

little bit trouble because he's a bit

slow but he will run fiercely behind you

and as you begin to weave following

Dee's crazy path through this maze of

collapsed buildings and walls it's very

clear that that shadow of the dragon is

descending upon you and even here and

now a wing flap that just it's the first

one you've heard since he appeared and

it just kind of echoes throughout the

entire city and as you watch you can see

sort of magically coming out of the tips

of his wings are wands and that's where

we'll stop for today all right all right

so that concludes the session I want to

say thank you Matthew for joining us and

we look forward to having you back in

the new year
