camera action we are back from the

stream of many eyes so welcome everybody

and welcome to our returning guest star

Travis thank you bye hi everybody thanks

for coming back Travis yeah no problem

crazy bad dream you know the guy aground

got really gross so I couldn't see my

battle buddy man yeah that's fair

oh that's right you guys totally totally

totally just ran roughshod yeah quickly

generated fan so just to catch people up

the waffle crew is in water deep and

went to chair con where they met this is

by the way a local convention in water

deep held at a residence in the C Ward

one of the more upscale parts of town

and so they had to dress up and make

themselves presentable and leave many of

their big weapons and things behind

except me except even and when they got

there they cornered Renier never ember

son of the ousted Lord of open Lord of

Waterdeep d'Agoult never amber and

Deandra near had a sort of Sons against

fathers moment but you also encountered

Renee's friend adventurer named Magnus

who joined forces with the waffle crew

when chair con came under attack by

creatures boiling up out of its cellars

as well as a what appear to be a

betrayal by members of the dung sweepers

guild of the city who sort of locked the

doors and sealed everybody inside

however the party prevailed Strix

animated a piano that proceeded to

tumble down a staircase fell on top of

Magnus but Magnus was able to heave it

off of him and crush a bunch of bad guys

underneath it

and evylyn using her paladin presence

all of her all of her charm and charisma

swayed the leader of the bad guys a

dwarf who's missing one of his arms and

has a crossbow attached to the stump was

able to sway him over to the waffle

crews side at the end of the session

assassins or thieves of those of the

Santarem sent the kidnapper anair during

the distraction where themselves

defeated one of them tried to slip away

on a zipline to an awaiting coach but

the waffle crew lucked out after him

intercepted him and captured him alive

that's where we pick things up so you

guys have boiled out of this mansion and

are kind of out on the street or running

rapidly toward the coach where this guy

has been apprehended by I believe it was

DF who first he he had like zip-lined

down and then it was Magnus jumping

through a window even flying in on a

strict misty stepping yeah I did

something cool too right Papa paltin

sauntered out through the front door

flash and in no particular rush you see

Warrington monk filling the doorway

behind him and several other people

pouring out of the residence in terror

but nobody really paying attention other

than you guys nobody really paying

attention to the coach parked on this

side street the fellow that you

apprehended is dressed in black leather

armor he has a scar from his lower lip

down to the cusp of his chin and he's

got these sort of bloodshot dark shifty

eyes and he he seems absolutely panicked

at having got how many of those eyes

does he have yeah two of them currently

a standard say that mom yes

you can see that the coach isn't going

anywhere at the moment because he didn't

get a chance to sort of mount up and

take the reins so the horses are just

waiting in the street you can see

members of the dung sweepers guild

scattering among the various other

masses fleeing the building all right so

he was he inside the coach he didn't he

did not make it over the driver's seat

before he was pulled down and

apprehended by you raped and I try in a

whole person on one of those dung

sweepers that are fleeing sure 60 in

real nervous I'm sorry yes you cast the

spell and you freeze one of them in

place all right excellent one well done

Strix now you know it'll only be a

matter of time before the city watch

shows up probably not long I would like

to set the horses free from the carriage

okay you untie the horses they bolt down

the street once you smack them on the

button be free my friends and never tell

your story would like to talk to very

sternly with this

supposing assassin and I'm gonna request

the assistance of paltin in this Oh

evylyn if you could give her to the one

that Strix froze and make sure that

doesn't go anywhere and get ready to

because we have some questions for them

too

she goes over and stands hold them with

your strong arms isn't it are they

already Hills well they can't do it

forever and she just kind of like gently

embraces them just let me know we mean

business she Pat's him on the shoulder

so so with palton here des will then

start talking to the suppose it assassin

mm-hm

and just be like hey buddy what was all

that about problems like I'm not saying

a word call him just smacks him in the

face

[Laughter]

sorry I just got here I assume that's

what we're doing but oh cool

sorry hey and also hi nice nice to meet

you yeah you sort of send him rocking

his head kind of bangs off the side of

the cab

mm-hmm yeah it'll look kind of like

again after Halton slaps him up a bit

yeah and that's the gentlest thing that

my friend here can do to you yeah man

it's gonna get rough I mean unless

you're into it in which case you know we

can get Gendler I don't know whatever

sinks your sub man carry on

why were you after Rainer make a

intimidate check with advantage all

right so with advantage yeah 8:00 okay

Oh Gary nice boy oh he says I'm not

afraid of you lean scrawny little runt

what not wrong Magnus I was right tip

over the carriage strength athletics

check that is a 19 ok tables yeah City

does that does that deer feel like not

even looking yeah just maintaining eye

contact assassin just says oh I'm not

the one you should be scared of I'm

actually trying to protect you uh-oh I

your safety net and you don't want to

have to you don't have to lose me we

think he might know the location of the

stone of gold

it just the stone of galore is an

artifact that contains knowledge about

the location on the vault of dragons

where his father pointing in Rainier

hidden half a million gold pieces Paul

misses leg on the stone knows where the

vault of dragons is and he knows where

the stone is I'm sure that the stone

knows yes it's an intelligent item or

artifact or something it's about this

big and you as you talk to this thing

yes his father put the knowledge of the

vault in the stone some wizard helped

him create it Paul turns idiot he's like

stealing mac talking stone this guy's I

think he's out of his mind

no it's real it's a talking stove damn

it of course yes oh it's it probably

talks a lot not man Dave actually takes

this and kind of plays along with palton

rather than Fulton as being genuine or

not yes just like oh yeah okay I talking

stone a wizard made it to hold the

knowledge did it okay and if they have

the stone and then you lose it you also

lose the knowledge it takes the

knowledge out of you after it's given to

you that's why of course yelling for

Nick yeah we're talking about magic

stones that talk and have knowledge it's

it's all true can I are gonna check that

um you have nothing really to Arkana

check oh he's just okay fine never mind

that's totally possible well then how

about this who sent you

he says I work for the Zen Terran that's

all you need to know does he have any

visible markings of this entire room

tattooed

and like I've seen other people or the

rings or you can see he's got a signet

ring with his entire symbol on it on his

right hand

it seems legit middle finger it looks

like a looks like a legit ring yes

is that bad just confusing okay in the

meantime

evylyn is having a quiet and meaningful

come to life and ER conversation with

the person she's holding Strix does not

tell her that they can't hear her she's

just whispering sweet with Anders in his

ear

usually that dwarf with the the armature

mo you can see he doesn't like this guy

that your friends are interrogating it

all and he looks like he's ready to

appear some full of crossbow bolts mmm

interesting is it is he hanging around

me yeah in the general vicinity and he's

sort of looking all around him very

suspiciously like he's he's expecting

the city watch to show up any minute and

he's afraid he's gonna get arrested and

he doesn't want he wants to run away but

at the same time he doesn't want to

leave your presence remember that the

morning Lord shines down and all of his

mercy and protects us and we don't need

to worry about a single thing he just

takes in some air and does you know I

didn't catch your name

he says Nazca write Nazca I think I did

catch that but I forgot cuz it's been

like way too many weeks since I played

Dean Dean that's safe out here well if

you really think about it what can

anyone do to us when the light of the

morning Lord shines down upon us a lot

here when we get underground

I want this conversation to stop so I

undo the whole person I'm like grab them

hard evylyn yeah I got ya you've got

this dung sweeper who is basically rigid

alright and I'm you know I'm gonna walk

up tour I'm gonna look at the dung

sweeper and be like hey cutter why'd you

lock us in there there's me picking up

trash Oh

okay yeah okay evil is just holding them

by the shoulders and like showing them

districts like this letting her talk and

that's a 21-2 yeah it seems fairly

intimidated and says tells you to ask

the dwarf I looked down at the dwarf and

I'm like tell Lysander what you did the

dwarf shoots the dung sweeper guild want

you to do and know through that right

through the chest it dies in your arms

no can I lay on hands really quick I

have hands on them dies in your arms and

then almost immediately you see a it

goes limp in your arms eyes roll back

into this dung sweeper guild members

head and clearly clearly expired from

the wound and almost instantly all of

you see phasing onto the cobblestone

street about five feet away from the

corpse is a creature that looks like no

no do a brain with legs you know some

people like to call me a brain with legs

so yeah so one of these guys it looks

like a human brain

purplish brain with these ghastly

ghastly legs and as it faces into

existence I like everybody to make

initiative rolls do we any of us

recognize those that is a good question

let's go over to the first and then

we'll see I rolled a 12 why go for

Magnus 12 did you also get a 12 people

no I got 16 16 I also got 16 16 Strix

I got an 8 I'm using my Friendship magic

dice you got me Chris there good one

good 12 12

all right and warrington neutral and

great what's-his-face nuts go what was a

14 yeah and so as soon as this creature

appears nazca says that is an intellect

devour bomber and it is deaths turn

death what do you do oh never mind it's

the inflective hours turn know what does

look like an hour with you not my

intellect hmm

I'm not that worried about it it will

target one creature that I can see

within 10 feet of it that has a brain

let's see um a whole bunch of brains

here so we're all randomly okay that

will be interesting unexpected maybe

saving for coming excitement exactly

okay alright so Warrington Mundt grips

his head in pain and says blimey I'm

being assailed and enough to me that my

aura does anything for him oh you know

what that would be that would certainly

come into play you see you had a +5

right yeah okay

he says the exact same thing and takes

11 psychic damage Warrington after all 3

d6 this is how much intelligence he

loses

oh wait loses yeah loses all right so

yes he grabs his cranium in horrible cry

in pain and you see he just sort of kind

of starts to stagger around and he

appears to be stunned at the moment and

then it is DF turn kill it kill it

all right so with all this crazy

nonsense do you thought wanting to lose

his captive mm-hmm

pull out gutter and kind of use it to

threaten him with just kind of have it

Adam just be like you're not going in

the air and then we'll take the dagger

from the front of his belt and then

throw it at the intellect of our earth

okay the cool one the cool one yes all

right make your a capital it's not very

good 18 that is a hit great I'll just do

whopping six points of damage all right

so you stick it um did you want to

recall your dagger uh no I'll keep it in

there for now

all right yeah so did embeds in his

brainy body oh I don't have a gutter

that's right I left behind before we

showed up here oh that's right yes okay

so that jagoff throat the intellect of

our reforms it into his hand and points

it back at its captive

okay yeah evylyn what do you do at

almost the exact same moment deaaath

attacks this thing with his dagger I am

gonna just let go of this now dead

corpse yep and to the ground with a

splat and I'm gonna meaningfully look at

Magnus as I ignite my my

Spinelli and I'm like you thinking what

I'm thinking yeah all right she goes

goes to attack it all right try stop

around to stay out of striking range of

you but that's easier said than done

yeah I oh I only rollin 11 that is a

miss oops uh I go again okay okay that

is a hit it is hit on a 12 okay good

evylyn was going to be very chagrined um

especially after making a big deal out

of being battle buddies yep uh let's see

eight six fourteen eighteen okay so you

just turn it into a flaming pile of crap

so it's dead now yeah you sort of kick

it with your foot Magnus I was so ready

and it twitches a little bit but you

know it's dead you you know that this

brain just looks around for other things

to attack well let's see there's the guy

that DF is holding at knifepoint isn't

armed

kidnapper that you captured and have

been interrogating there's also the

dwarf with the the missing member yeah

I'm gonna say I do attack the dwarf but

I'm not going to use my super powerful

sword I have a gauntlet called phantom

fists that lets me push people around if

I hit them okay great beat him up yes

that's 24 oh yeah you pound on it and

tolling one D four plus four so only

five points of damage and I'm gonna kind

of push him backwards you know yeah

far five feet yes not to be like and

there's more of that more attacks if I

chose to

so this was like a like a right hook a

left cross an uppercut kind of yeah

let's go with uppercut I'm really trying

to like I'm leveling it yeah yeah you

basically launch him off his feet and he

goes stumbling backward and lands on his

butt and you can already see the big

welt forming on his head from the

Smashing phantom fist all right and the

rest of you see this dwarf knocked off

his feet and he sort of snarls and then

he looks up at evil and plaintively like

nasca sometimes we have to face the

consequences of our actions even though

the morning Lord forgives us he wrestles

with that moral conundrum for a moment

giving palton a chance to act so like

right after like the the brain thing

dies there's like a there's like a knife

in him and then evylyn comes in and just

like slaughters it to mush you just look

so he's like yeah I think y'all got it

and then uh so what's uh so what's

around what am I so there's there's an

overt you're on a a cobblestone street

in sort of one of the wealthier parts of

the city where all these sort of big

ivy-covered manners or staring down at

you with blank vapid windows and there

are people who have scattered through

the streets even here whistles of the

city watch converging on the house and

your location there is an overturned

carriage next to you free of horses who

have gone on to better lives and a dwarf

on his butt and a hippo man staggering

around making the poor hippo man like

ask the poor I'm like stood dwarf are we

oh yeah are we fighting him is that what

is that we're doing

instructions unclear I appear to have

forgotten how to walk in a straight line

it's a

doing great we all believe in you you're

killing it left right left right right

oh it's alright dude don't worry about

it asking why he did that make him tell

us the truth what's going on okay cool I

will approach the dwarf and give him a

good chatting okay at this point what do

you want to say to him I like kind of

he's still like knocked down right yeah

so you can just kind of kneel down or

crouched down beside them I just kind of

uh I like squat down and look at him and

just kind of so what's your deal man

what's going on he says I am enforcer in

the zenith our guild I work for the

beholder we are enemies of the Sontaran

I would see them all destroyed and rid

the city of their presence forever okay

this city isn't big enough for the two

of us but for you and me it's alright

it's me and that's fair like we can we

physically fit here now so I understand

what you got yeah so is he one of the

good group which one's the good group in

which was the bad group is there is

that's no good group here yeah I'm

unclear yeah all right cool Ranieri

wills just say that the the zanaffar

guild although it operates underneath

the city is not welcome in water deep

thieves guilds are not allowed generally

speaking and this is basically a

criminal organization that's been

allowed to persist below the city

they're all terrible horrible monsters

these ant doesn't Arum while they

present themselves as legitimate

business and have solidified a hold in

the city they too are just as

reprehensible in a lot of ways he has no

high opinions but either of these

organizations and would love Waterdeep

to be rid of the book and if either of

them gets the stone of goal or that's

bad and he says to you paulten and to

you

F and I do not know where the Stono

galore is I do not know what my father

intended to do with it after he left the

city cowardly that he is I believe

him

can I click quick question the guy by

the carriage said something about it

taking the knowledge away Aranea is it

possible you did know at some point well

if this person isn't lying to us then

yes it is possible that I have had the

stone in my possession and merely

forgotten about it but there would be no

way of him knowing if it took is that

knowledge away from him correct if you

believe if you believe this piece of

 I want to turn back to the entire

I'm a sand

yeah and just be like Do You Know Who I

am who we are no do the names dable or

Yarra mean anything to you

oh yes you stupid idiot does the

name Magnus let's find out I travel with

the wizard you killed the black spider

that's yeah I did do that both the guy

and his actual big black spider I think

he's a real hero versus oh really I've

done some stuff I did I'd saved a plane

at least I think a bunch of other ones I

didn't follow up but what's that like

being a hero endorsement deal Alton the

dwarf tries to get you to help him get

off the ground well this is going on I

also opened a dog training school I'm

just like yeah this is I know this is a

lot this happens I guess

and then once he once you help him up he

just sort of pushes you aside and goes

over to evil him because you're in his

way and then he comes over to you evil

and he says I killed that man to make a

point there's a creature in the city

that is investing members of the dumb

sweepers guild with those creatures that

you've just killed though you killed

that innocent person because they were

infested by another creature yes to be

fair he made that wrong what what point

were you trying to make they cleaned up

 for a living I mean don't bash his

job man he's just trying to get by hey

I'm trying to have a conversation with

her shut up leans in you done up

now son look I know you're you're

turning over a new leaf the world is

very confusing and it's hard to know

right from wrong and I'm not one to tell

you what's right from wrong I'm just

trying to understand he's wrong okay but

I'm not sure I'm clear on what point you

were trying to make other than just to

show us that that person was infected in

which case you could have maybe just

said hey evylyn new friend servant of

Lysander guess what that person's

infested by someone that's making them

do bad things okay shut up for a minute

I throw rock you're great oh okay you

and me in turns he turns to you falton

and just starts doing this to you with

his one arm you and me right now these

sort of stands in front of you

protectively noski like he's protecting

you from palton me yeah

[Laughter]

so while this is going on you can

actually see

coming down the street a big swath of

City Watchmen thank good you're gonna

take they're there they're about 30

seconds from reaching your position and

nasca says turns back to you evil and

says there was nothing that could be

done his brain was eaten by that

creature he was already dead he was just

a meat puppet there was no way to save

him and if you don't want if you don't

want other people in the city becoming

like him then maybe you should kill the

creature who made him who's that and

I'll help you it's name is nyle aura

it's a mine Slayer Oh mine flavor oh my

and you'll help us I'll help you

of course I know where it lives okay mom

it's a little I don't like mine players

and I don't like people being possessed

you see him load his crossbow and kind

of stare at the city watch and he says

I'm wanted by all want you well I really

don't like to arrest me well I think I

won't take care of that I don't like

taking alarm unarmed he says I'm always

armed so you see Laska sort of standing

planting his feet as though ready to

basically unload on the approaching city

watch me now I know you've maybe been in

a place where violence solves everything

for a long time but trust us the Centaur

guys like yeah I'm wanted too

so let's get this taken care of you know

we clearly made a mistake you know

dabble and Yara you're working for them

well yeah I'm sorry this was all a

misunderstanding

just no shooting guards okay can we all

agree no more shooting no more stabbing

let's all just talk um so here is there

any kind of like sewer system or

something we can escape into yeah

Nausicaa tells you that there are sewers

all over the city

and sewer access points here over there

everywhere he actually knows where the

closest store great is

should we Magnus we don't need to escape

we've done nothing wrong and I have a

lot of parking tickets I'll take care of

like burnished is her like chest plate

you know she's kind of like rolls or

shoulders back if she's like hello

protectors of Waterdeep and discuss to

meet them at Oxford she goes walking out

toward this way yeah that'll be fun

death will turn over to Rainer it's like

uh I'm sure you can about her exactly

that everything that's happened here

like you know we're just yeah you could

get Bouch for us you know what was going

on I'm sure you as a noble you'll have

some sway with the city guard he he

looks at you knowingly you can see a lot

of things racing through his head right

now he's taking in your words he's

looking at the the corpse lying on the

ground bleeding out the burning wreckage

of the intellect devour the dwarf

criminal these and teram criminal and he

sort of sucks in some air and here's

your words and nods and we'll sort of

follow evil in toward the guards great

diesel didn't turn back hasn't talked on

positions and just be like you have

seconds to escape he nods at you and

darts away then he'll turn to over back

towards Nazca and just be like this

one's your call

the nazca says I'm with her all right

even as we approach this weight this the

all of these guards and there's a dozen

of them approaching you from this

direction alone you can see that there

is a sergeant who appears to be a female

half work leading a company of

impeccably dressed city watch officers

male and female of various races human

dwarf baffling and her evylyn approaches

like the like the boss like she she

walks up she's like I'm so glad you're

here I am very concerned because I have

heard of a scourge affecting the city

and that is these monsters do you see

that mess of brain matter I just had to

kill that because apparently these are

infesting

all of your citizens did you know make a

persuasion check Strix is behind her by

the way dragging the body core we're

just like to the side of the street oh

he's just like lost it and she's just

like blacked out and is just dragging

the body away like I get the body gotta

get the bodies out of the street it's

her old signal habits do I know the

damage cuz Lysander no but you have a

method you have advantage unknowingly

because Ryanair never ever sort of crept

up behind you okay and his presence

lends much better lens 43 all right she

asks she says to you would you mind if

we take a full deposition from you and

your companions well we don't have much

time because we are on a mission of the

morning Lord but I'm certainly happy to

help you with anything that you might

need and she says how about you Lord

never amber do you have anything to add

and he says I think I can probably

resolve this for everybody if they have

to be on their way and she says that

will suffice

that's so very kind thank you you are

doing such great work protecting this

great city and I am so honored to have

been of any service you can see that

they the Watchmen don't hold you up any

further evilly she blows them a kiss and

walks back to her party all right

okay where are we going how's evil a

never run for political office even

though this is the first time this

probably even mentioned to you

oh you office I could I couldn't have I

you think so oh yeah well I know a

couple mayors I think at this point and

you're way better at you know talking

than they are this can only go to good

places Church walks up with like blood

on her hands and she's like I moved the

body but I don't know where to wipe the

blood and I was close since she has it

on her like nice robe and she's like

yeah that's fine even kind of like

points to that and she's like I don't

know I've kind of had a chance at the I

don't know the political or the whatever

you call that kind of life and I kind of

prefer this one strix you know that you

can press the digitate that blood away

and of course she does

yep after smearing it all over her dress

uh-huh

evylyn just kind of smiles lovingly at

that and is like affirmed that she made

the right life choices so you just

talked to them and they gonna let us all

go even me well you know oh yeah well

actually approach Rainer at this point

yeah you can see he's having a

conversation he's just relaying

everything that he saw witnessed inside

the mansion omitting any real business

with you yeah death is a bit

apprehensive of the guards kind of

maintains his distance but whenever that

discussion is over

he'll just let Rainier know that dia

feels that you know they have more

business together where they're

professional or personal that we could

pop up to talk about more sometime and

that potentially more people could come

after

Rayner and should he need assistance

this is how he can find me and tried out

really information to him to whoever

Deif likes to stay and where does the at

like this day you know all-around

dawning portal I mean we stayed here

there we stay at the spire or will you

used to say at the spires of the Sawyer

but you haven't been there in a long

time you haven't even checked in there

evil and they don't even know that

you're in the city know the ethics

tricks had like like a shed or a hovel

that they're all this yeah there's no

way that's gonna be good doesn't have an

address

yeah you guys can stay with me other

holiday in if you wanted I mean you've

been to the awning portal you do know

that they have rooms there you could

just say that's a as a place yeah I

would say just leave a message at the

yawning portal okay he tells you at a

time he goes to be on a portal fairly

frequently he's got a friend named flume

that he drinks with there from time

excellent and then should we ever cross

paths again or need each other's

assistance then yeah do he says I'll

come looking for you shortly

great and then da just kind of give them

like a hand across onto his shoulder and

just be like we're more alike than you

could ever know stay safe as you walk

away back yeah if you can see some other

guards who have the mansion and sort of

checking it out are reporting to the the

sergeant that it looks like there was an

incursion that came up out of the

settled cellars underneath the house

goblins bugbears that kind of thing none

of the monsters seemed to have survived

in any way shape or form it doesn't look

like any of the patrons got hurt or any

of the staff got hurt

looks like it was all on the bad guys

hmm all right great and none of the

chairs were seriously damaged it kind of

saved I think yeah I do hope badge

members got reimbursed

but constricts Co I'm gonna go up to

Magnus and be like hey Magnus um didn't

did you say that you will you travel to

someone that looked like this before

oh yeah I mean I'm not really good with

this kind of thing my memory is pretty

spotty I had like a century's worth of

memory storm years in a swamp and even

goat blood really uh-huh I was in a

mannequin for a while a warlock

generated a new body of mine yeah but it

was great because I got my eye back or

was it what was wrong something I got I

healed it was great I'm like 85 what I'm

140 oh I I remember it mmm it was

something cuz I carpentry carving this

this big hippo man taps you on the

shoulder Magnus and says my dear sir are

we friends perhaps I don't seem to

remember who you are can I try to heal

him what do you do what you try on him

clay on your hands how much do you want

to lay on hands for just tend to see

what happens okay it doesn't seem to

have any visible impact he seems quite

confused and confounded I say you know

we've never met before now but I'm

always open to friendship yes

have you always been with them seems

like you know I've travelled quite a bit

I'm just here now taking in the sights

it looked kind of guiltily Pat's him and

she looks at ever just like I don't know

what I'm gonna is this like a frying pan

thing I like maracas I

turn my staff into one of those I'll

turn it into a frying pan no we're not

hitting him Walton I'm gonna go up to

Warrington just like look at him like do

you remember me what kind of silly

question is that Pippin because I

remember wow he's so far gone

poor man will never be the same what I

know that he needs a restoration spell

or like a temple spell or should I need

to make another kind of check just to

you as Holly knows that I'm Strix does

it 15 yeah you think

a restoration spell can restore his lost

intelligence you also think well let me

see let me just double take something

but that's the that's the quickest

surefire way yeah and I believe it's a

greater restoration was needed I think

it is as well yeah which would be only

something we can do at the spires of the

morning look unfortunately indeed

all right so strictly and be like hey so

he needs like bigger magic than any of

us can do so like we need to go to we

need to go to the spires probably I'm so

yeah I know I don't I didn't like living

there either but I insisted I didn't say

I didn't like living there you're giving

me that look evylyn look I wasn't it's

fine today when we say something about

it you're like look at oh I am I mean we

also have a mind flare those for some

reason trying to take over the dung

sweeper guild for well we know could be

an agent of the zenith art or isn't Arum

and it's placing agents all around the

city yes we use them as spies for

Thought guilt oh it's okay so you just

admitted it there yes well they often

come down to the sewer so they make easy

targets to capture sculptures well

personally

all of them are zenith our agents know

it takes a while to breed these

creatures but whenever we get a new

batch we try to find captives to put

them in not always dung sweeper guild

members other

- is there any way to identify someone

who has been infested with them of them

he says Nile or keeps a list and are you

safe - yeah these things are grown in

vats out of brains that have been

surgically removed from other creatures

by the mind flayer and transformed into

these monsters Oh gross

okay no come on I was growing into that

it's father gross okay uh okay um well

maybe not that I don't want to go there

but maybe we should ask someone to take

Warrenton to the spires and then we

should deal I have thought mind flayers

very brittle spines uh-huh okay well I

think we need to help him with his

problem but can you fight Warrington of

course I see doesn't matter you can

fight it let's take him along

I think he's I'm training them seven

martial arts do you do you feel okay

Warrington I feel a little out of sorts

do you do you want to get some medical

attention or do you want to fight my

flares and rip their spines out this is

that is always a jolly good pastime game

if you are good enough for me the

headache is a little crashing but what

can you rule great Nazca where can we

find this Nigel er guy he says that

there is a sewer complex or a sewer

Nexus in the doc ward which he can take

you to lead you down into and there and

you will find the creature should we

like prepare a little bit like maybe

like maybe some like potions of not

he says he says that there's a the

absolument employer hats maybe the the

access point is under a shop called the

old za blob shop oh I've been there

lob shot the Saab lob shop and deaath

you you know that it is a Curiosity Shop

in the doc ward so sort of near an

intersection at the end of candle Lane

and it's a dark part of the neighborhood

and the most distinctive thing about

it's got a stuff to be holder in the

window yeah and it's currently run by a

gnome this is named Bob's a blob

his name is na he calls himself za blob

his real name Tony you don't think za

blob is has given me no ya know so death

will say nasca you do understand that we

have to stop this of course yeah but I'm

with you now I just I've seen the light

mm-hmm Lysander yeah and what a light

all right good enough for me do you all

need to go grab the rest of your

equipment or are you ready to go portal

we should find some potions of like I

don't know like 9 she'll dig or

something if this is brainstuff just

saying close to me it'll be a little bit

better I do recall that mind flayers

have some ability to project their

psionic thoughts I don't remember how

they do it exactly oh damn it can i

Arcana check that baby then guess sure

all right

that's a dirty 20 Oh Great yeah you know

that they all mind flayers can basically

project a cone of psychic energy that

blasts and stuns you into oblivion it

tears your mind to shrapnel basically

yeah and that's bad yes they also of

course while you're stunned and reeling

from the effect use their tentacles to

pry open your skull and suck out your

brains this may be some sort of

constructs that doesn't have a brain is

there a range to the mind flayer yeah

you know that it typically this blast

that it emits I think extends out about

60 feet in a very broad cone so it can

get a lot of people at once

cool yeah that's exactly right

extracting brains they also have the

ability to detect thoughts and to

dominate creatures with magic fun they

can bend the wills of their enemies and

use them as pawns against their allies

so weak minded creatures beware I can do

that so this is like boss fight it's

it's mind flayers our butch are we doing

this the potions for something we

probably should have wore Internet full

capacity first things first let's go

retriever stuff maybe take a moment to

get a short rest or a long one if you

need it let's get up let's take more

maybe Mornington will get better after

he sleeps well how long does the does

the ritual take I could take him well

you guys retrieve your stuff oh yeah

that's true you can visit the spires at

the lovely place evil it has enough to

go with you and be weird I have been

looking forward to visiting a spires

I've heard great things it's in all the

travel it's not that I don't want to go

there I always want to go there

obviously uh-huh so it's just very kind

of you Magnus but that's all guess we

shall definitely split up

[Laughter]

[Music]

it's just we're gonna rest make sure

we're all ready get some food in our

bellies take a moment to recollect and

consider all of our options and then

we'll figure out in there Magnus just

wanted me just later yeah that sounds

great and then Magnus says in thieves

can't the DIA

it's just possible I'm suspecting now

that maybe Warrington might have been

dominated and if he attacks me I'm gonna

kill her yeah back you do you man okay

make sure we're on the same page all

right so this heads off with Warrington

and you all you hear is Warrington's

voicing is splitting the party never

fails accurate I don't like how fresh he

is yeah I like this for Ian he should be

like this forever SAS what do the rest

of you do uh go get her stuff back at

the yawning portal okay guys we're

elected right that's right yeah when you

show up the lung the only portal not a

heck of a lot has changed there's more

people here and it's a little more

gregarious than it was before nobody's

going up and down the big hole in the

middle

it's pretty quiet and gloomy but make

perception checks to see what else you

notice around you 23 23 13 13 14 14 17

17 palton and DF you can see that yara

stone fist the half-orc

centaur bodyguard she's in an arm

wrestling contest right now with a big

burly guy and she's she's she's got this

pretty much locked over by the bar

chatting with Durnin is the elf Da'Ville

star song

so those are two familiar faces that you

see amid the myriad other faces that you

don't recognize palton you see that the

bard that you stole the loot from this

little boy to ring around he's having a

conversation with some halflings at a

table but currently not performing he

looks very tired and weary I still have

it right you totally do you did not give

up

I like walking I see him I'm just like

yep

you left waffles in here safe keeping

still safe you can also see Simon was

left here and is still is fine

he and waffles who don't see him any

worse for wear did he make any friends

who Simon mm-hmm yeah he's made all

kinds of friends in fact he's probably

like dancing on a tabletop right now

much joy of many onlookers

he seems like that girl that was chasing

him oh no it's probably just some other

folk who who of entry including some

adventurous types you can see who might

just be starting off their adventuring

career but they have taken a shine to

the wooden boy who they believe is just

animated through some sort of artifice

or magic and is some attraction that

Durham managed to procure and so

everybody seems on their best behavior

by and large Jared sorry yes uh no this

is DF notice is one other thing

and that is that the blonde fellow who

came out of the water not too long ago

and partook in the battle at the docks

who was carted off by the authorities is

here in the awning portal playing darts

with some other guys oblivious to your

arrival and seems to be having a good

time the one that was hitting on evylyn

the one that was hitting on evylyn oh

maloo maloo yeah he is here he he

obviously wasn't incarcerated and is

back in play and having a having times

life he's got he's throwing darts but

he's also got a mug tankard of ale in

his hand and is just laughing and having

a good old time so i guess as the

returned da thumb which just says out

loud like not even thinking about it

just being like Malou doing here Melissa

you start looking around frantically

evylyn for signs of this oh yeah as soon

as you wrapped to her nasca points

sticks his the pointy end of his weapon

into Paul tans buttocks and says what is

up with

him I don't know man he's bad news

though that guy okay become best

friends his eyes narrow as he stares at

maloom across the bar malloon turns

around it's like oh that's you morning

Lord going oh it's going great

everything is so awesome you're not you

just feel his blessing on you every day

and your life is so changed would you

like a beer I'm sure Oh have mine I'll

get another one can I can I like grab

some darts yeah whoever you snatch them

out of some Dwarfs hand mmm as he's sort

of waiting his turn I want to like try

and just like a mammal luminously all

right make arranged attacks with the

dart he's dying he's making his way over

to the bar right now 13 okay well

somebody's just totally stuck me with

the dart like it's good right hmm you

say that he holds up his crossbow things

like he's like no yeah so evylyn um

he'll come over to you again with his

ale evylyn just continues chatting him

up about nothing but love and ER she's

just like % interested in like the new

believers life and at one point his

flagon gets shot out of his hand and

shatters into a thousand pieces and this

big crossbow bolt sticks in a pillar and

he's just like oh did you see that my

drink exploded wow I'm just like

so I've got a room upstairs want to

check it out I mean is there something

cool about it it's got a really good

view do I hear this he says I'm not sure

but if we go up and look out the window

then we'll know Kenna is he sitting like

on a stool or something

I just stand-in there he blooms like

considering this she's like wanting to

be nice but super not interested in

seeing a view of Waterdeep right she's

like I mean oh how about this we go for

a walk there's a beautiful fountain like

ten blocks away it's strict hearing this

- she's this like stage so much noise

okay from the place you're not hearing

the the specific said you can just see

the gestures and the sort of

contemplative with all I don't want to

see this anymore

we could go see the god catcher it's one

of the walking statues but they don't

walk any more than just really big and

people build off stuff on them now is it

cause a cemetery of the Dead we can go

there for a picnic I'll get some stuff

from Durnan who else is in like is in

here

is there someone like particularly large

so something that I don't know you don't

have Warrington there are some burly

types I mean malloon is a big guy if you

want to go for somebody about his size

Yarra the half-orc

armwrestling champion is a candidate I

was more thinking uh just like some

particularly yeah some big burly Rando

yeah you look up and you can see on the

balcony above you that there is a in

who is so big that you think he might

have like giant blood in his veins he's

just a big looming figure sitting at a

table with a bunch of much smaller

humans

I'd like to approach this fella okay so

you start walking up a wooden spiral

staircase to the balcony to intercept

him d/f while this is going on yeah

make another perception check all right

great

you see coming through they were all

sort of in a booth in sort of shadowed

in darkness but as they step forth and

come out they're clearly moving toward

you and you can see that it is a group

of seven dwarves and they're moving

toward you with purpose the one in the

lead has a Chloe green cloak covering

much of his face certainly his eyes but

poking out you can see his nose and his

bushy beard which is really sort of

short and stubbly and you can see that

he is walking with the aid of a stone

cane and his arm is covered with burn

scars and as he approaches you he pulls

back his hood and his whole face is one

big burn scar through which patches of

beard are just starting to grow back and

you can see a cataract in filling one of

his eyes which is just sort of blackened

and charred

and he says you did this to us

death is unable to respond he is just

frozen in completely paralyzed out of

fear and guilt the Strickland turns from

moon is like no strikes is already

running over there advaitha surrounded

by these seven dwarves and paltin as

you've climbed the steps and you come

over to this half giant using at the

table and he's just having a good time

with some friends let's focus on his so

we're doing okay and below you you can

see everything in the the level below

and that's the first time you notice

that DF is has been confronted by Seven

Dwarfs one of whom looks badly badly

burned I looked toward that and then the

potential hiding do I feel particularly

suspicious or perturbed by the presence

of these doors there is something

threatening about their posture okay you

already see Strix flailing leg really

really quick I'm gonna go to this giant

man just like super cast it's like hard

hi how you doing great you you seem like

a real you seem like a stellar stellar

awesome person is that true oh yeah my

mother think so my saying yours think so

right on they sound awesome hey awesome

so what are you planning to you look

like you might be an adventurer do you

want to go down into

mountain with us what well let's let's

put a pin on that I actually had a I I

actually had a different thing to talk

to you about really quick but I'm very

limited on time if you got a second yeah

go ahead

okay I'm gonna point it gonna be like

it's like you see that guy you see that

guy's standing over there

well done more dragon huh balloon war

dragon that guy

yeah know him the super famous

adventurer member of force gray friend

of the black staff that guy yeah yeah ah

yeah I know that guy - I was just

talking to him and he was like he he

liked pointed at you and it was just

like man that guy probably can't throw

me through a window but I mean I don't

know oh yeah he's not too bright yeah

but you know he did save the city so I

guess that counts for something I'm

going to uh push swayed him be like so

you're saying you can't do it

what no I do it

I don't he was saying you can sir I

don't know I guess me maybe he's right

you know it's none of my business I

guess you got persuasion check actually

make it make that deception because

you're lying to imagine okay okay sure

in 1908 right I'd say Oh also actually

if I could just for fun I want to play a

little a little jingle be like here's a

little tune - yep alright you play it on

this three string lute I take it mm-hmm

all right downstairs the Bart's like I

know that Luke

so is your string as you're stringing

the lute you make eye contact with the

bard at the bar and he just looks up at

you it's like hey you got it set up for

you you see him right yeah where

everybody's maced

they started their own little thing

thanks what do you do as you see these

dwarves you can see they're all sort of

pulling something out from their cloaks

oh okay well I'm back in my I'm guessing

I've already changed for my fancy outfit

like back in the bite garbage you just

literally walked in the door one OK for

me just ignore that yeah Strix will just

run in front of in front of Dean's be

like oh what's so what's what's what's

the problem here it looks like hi hello

you can see of the Seven Dwarves only

one of them bears these horrible

horrible burn marks and he says my name

is Kaz great dragon heel I am a survivor

of the iron slag Inferno oh that was an

accident

no it was not it was absolutely an

accident but that was a lot sometimes

when fire is involved things get burned

and usually the fire is good attention

but that's that was an act I was let me

tell you isn't it as an experience you

see they're getting higher and do you

want to burn me Mabel that make you feel

better and leave you can go ahead and do

it what they're all pulling out appears

to be a stone coin bigger than the coin

you would use as currency and these sort

of slap it they slap them down one at a

time on the bench near them and you can

see each of these stone coins has a

different icon in the center of it

almost like a crest or some sort of

emblem mm-hmm and that's when behind UDF

you hear Nazca say aw crap Emma Stone

Boulder shoulder paddle sure to walk to

the fountain sounds real nice yeah see

you're walking arm-in-arm with balloon

and then suddenly evil and Melina's kind

of stopped when a half giant taps him on

the shoulder and says hey Lou oh hey big

guy what's up that guy over there with

the lute playing with a lute says well

he had some words saying that you

thought that I couldn't throw you

through window millions like oh don't

dude you totally could throw me through

window you could throw me through

 killer I go invisible hey Travis

here's the kind of stuff that we yeah

eventually yeah yeah and so even at this

moment malloon seems distracted by a

half giant who's about twice as big as

he is

even though malloon was quite a large

man so they seem distracted

hello my name is evil and greetings in

the light of our morning lord levander

and at that point you just sense evil

and attention in the air your paladin

senses are tingling

and your eye is drawn to the dwarves

we're slapping these like you are

slapping these stone coins down don't

really need to give I mean thank you we

are poor that's money we do any money

but they know there's no need for this

she kind of like Pat's mill and she's

like will you just excuse me for just

one moment oh yeah

thank you she walks over there to stand

next to Strix and looks at the coins and

she's like okay what's going on jóska

will

tap you and say those stone coins are

the emblems of the seven great dwarven

clans of the north oh that's so nice

these are the seven great dwarven clay

it is a pleasure to meet you greetings

in the light of our morning Lord levator

the bat the fire scarred dwarf says for

the crimes that you have inflicted upon

dwarven kind we the seven clans of the

north demand recompense crimes us him

pointing a deer no I think you have the

wrong he unleashed the fire primordial

LA and then sinner ated scores of us

that bad what that was the black that

sounds very unbelievable yes I've done

that death would have told us I saw it

happen

I was there I survived but that did it

that didn't happen what do you have to

say to yourself you dis it just exploded

uhh

speak you coward no Strix

evylyn enough

I confess and I admit I unleashed a fire

up armorial and I incinerated so many of

you in your people and no apology will

ever be enough I'd I thought I would

that's right no apology will be enough

we don't want your apologies why why

would you do that

Oh what it must have been an accident it

was an accident it was an accident

he did it deliberately no he would never

do that

am i lying he's not lying I admit my

guilt well it was an accident

that's not guilt that's its intent

intent is important he raced it

intentionally you know he didn't

dan you wouldn't do that tell she

comforts tricks she come free sushi

she's like Shh this is like even quiet

leader says tell us the truth what

happened inside before I could ever

release the fire primordial to destroy

the heart destroy all of iron slag I

knew that I wanted to help the slaves I

knew they were there and I thought I

could get them out but the cages the

locks they were there a massive it

wasn't beyond youth I could do I thought

maybe the fire would I could melt away

the the locks and the cages and get them

out but it was it was too intense and it

doesn't matter you stood among us and

you released that thing and then you ran

away yes I did and now you're going to

pay for it

it was an accident he wanted to save the

slaves nasca says the dwarf clients have

already made that decision no no no no

one's making decisions if even one's

gonna have to sit like sedate strict

she's like continually talking she's not

stopping the seven cleanse the seven

greatest clients haven't agreed on

anything since the end of the silver

March is war and what did they agree on

and the burned guy says recompense

yes yes recompense what does that mean

divination spells cast by our clerics

have revealed that you will come into

possession of some treasure we want that

money oh well if you just want money

that's fine yeah that's fine right we

can't just give them some money it will

be service reparations to all the

families that you have caused pain to by

releasing that creature in the north

that still plagues the north to this day

that's that's all you seek is that gold

was taken from dwarven mines and it will

come back to the Dwarven hand you can

get it so get it if that is the very

least I can do

all we want you to do

deaath we'll get down onto both his

knees and not exactly bow but just kind

of like lower his like posture and

position down to them and just we'll say

I will retrieve your money though the

coins themselves will never Express the

amount of sorrow I carried with me

I have so many regrets in pain and the

very scars I plague you carry with me

every time I look at myself or think of

myself or a moment alone I've never

forgotten the faces in the screams I

meant no malice I only I only wanted to

help

you're pathetic you don't have pain and

then he just sort of pushes past you you

see that the other dwarves haven't said

much and they're they're just sort of

head lowered very stern stone-faced they

don't seem to look at you with the same

disgust you do see some hint of pity on

their face but you they strike you more

like emissaries or envoys than those who

have suffered directly gotcha am I like

still I'm still like up on that second

floor there that that bard has come

upstairs to look around for you but he

just sort of during this I was like

listening so I want look like I was

still like invisible it turns out most

of the bar was listening at that point

it's dead silent so like I I like like

turn Rhian visible and I like when I

like try and grab you villains attention

like hey he looks up and I'm like

charging a thunder wave I'm like so do

we not okay I also still imagine that

vivillon is covering strictest mouth at

this point just like she's kind of like

turning purple cause like she's like

she's just gonna passing out in her arms

yep

I also just want everyone to know across

town Warrington and Magnus have stopped

for ice cream well it's funny I was just

about to hop on that train so yeah you

guys are having well it's it's late

winter it's the beginning of spring

actually in water deep it's it's a cold

damp day there's still maybe hot

chocolate but hot chocolate definitely

and he's like I wonder if there's a

place around here where we can puke rare

are some firearms I feel positively

naked

like um we should probably okay listen I

I know I'm not normally the one to say

this but we should probably restore your

intelligence before we arm you my what

okay you'll have to talk louder I'm deaf

in one year you're what

I said I'm deaf in one ear no I know I

heard no never mind

um so I guess let's head towards the

spire there's a spire of course and fix

your brain right and then we'll get

weapons yes and kill the mind flayer

right yes

jolly good have all and you lead them to

so not too far from the water Dave's

great market which is just starting to

bustle with activity morning turning

into afternoon

you see rising up among of top above

rooftops the many many spires of the the

spires of the morning the temple of

Lysander and the sunlight gleaming off

of them warmly and as you make your way

around the buildings and enter the

structure itself you are greeted with a

temple of absolute majesty and immensity

beyond all expectation light that stands

in front of it and asks the passerby to

do a quick sketch of him in front of

n-gram yeah

shall I wait over here do you want me in

this ya know get in it of course

king of the Sun oh that's good we're

holding up the spire right oh yes we can

do this right

so afternoon wears on and you're handed

this piece of paper with several pieces

of paper with these charcoal sketches on

them of the two of you standing before

the spires of the morning and when you

enter there it's a hive of activity

people are leaving from their morning

their dawn prayers you can see that

there are acolytes

giving coins to some poor folk who have

been kind of corralled and brought

before the temple as you make your way

down hallowed halls there's all kinds

all the activity that you would expect

in a place where there's just a

tremendous amount of worship and traffic

going on and precede me I'm looking for

somebody to fix my friends brain please

it was eaten your presence given given

just your size and all the accoutrements

that you carry on you and the fact that

man with sort of golden yellow hair

mustache and beard in full priest's

regalia the image of the son prominent

on his on his vestments and on his stole

handshake and you know it maybe even a

hug with this sunbright person and I'm

going to pick their pocket

oh so you're gonna like swindle the

stuff out of the box or just take

something off of them that you didn't

have before uh either one it's a 20 okay

okay

so you Basin I've trained it the rogue

and I'm very profess so you bagged this

golden son safe holy symbol that is

absolutely encrusted with jewels grain

something that the priest was carrying

on him but not openly and you slipped

that away without anyone paying sick

mind and do you think it might it's

something about it suggests it might be

magical in some small way anyway you you

you steal that without the priests

knowledge and says really it best be

headed back to our friends Pippin

dingdong Evelyn and Strax well we can

look for them after we look for palton d

after the priest says did you say evylyn

know what yes why I know many Evelyn's

but I know only one evylyn and it really

it isn't perchance evil in a Valona how

vague morphine like I'm going to roll

perception to see or maybe insight to

see how he I think he feels about that

eighteen paladin of Lysander Lord of the

light how does he seem to feel about

that it might be even your role suggests

that he is a longtime acquaintance of

hers and was just sort of things set off

like oh my god that can't like it's just

one of those weird he's overcome with

the coincidence of the possibility of

seeing her again

it doesn't you don't send sense any

malevolence okay yeah cells sounds like

the same person I mean listen it's a mad

mad mad mad world who knows we could be

talking about two different Evelyn

paladin's of the fans or good shining

light you know that person but it's

probably the same right he says I wonder

so she has done something immense

possibly even saved the world oh cool

if she is who I hope she is and you know

where she is I would very much like to

see her again tell her please father

Luke sunbright that the spires of the

morning wishes to meet with her okay if

she is the evil and I know she will want

to see me again

okay it's possible we might be

distracted as we are going off to fight

a mind flare in the sewers if she

doesn't return I will be sure to relay

that message to you good sir and you're

fine temple will be none deprived of the

information high-five

yes off we go and off we go yes Lord oh

[Laughter]

I didn't roll from warrington to see if

he would have noticed this actually

anyway so where are you going after the

temple because Warrington does have his

Hawk rather settled getting some guns

yeah okay um yeah let's go buy a weapon

for the hippo ma'am

right you go into the market where all

the activity and the hustle and bustle

is starting to kind of take over the

place as you do two riders on Griffin's

fly over your heads and over the market

and the riders are wearing gleaming

armor they seem to be part of the

Griffin cities Griffin cavalry and the

market is a dazzle and the buzz with all

sorts of activity and as you make your

way around sniffing around for anything

that might interest the Warrington you

are gravely disappointed and as is he

that there is nothing really a for his

size and of a blasty nature he was

looking for something loud with

gunpowder and that can blow holes and

things and

there's nothing of that sort here well

no luck but we'll keep an eye on it

because we walk back to the yawning

portal and meet up with them what I

promise you if we see a blunderbuss

store all right

Warrington says leave it's all right

with you I would like to continue

looking around all right

can you find your own way back yeah

probably I mean what who what are the

odds all get lost or get in trouble or

something

all right make a survival check 16 you

do not get lost yeah all right the rest

of you yes

the dwarves at this point are filing

themselves out and they nod to the rest

of you introducing themselves by various

names and the clans to which they are

associated but they leave the stone

coins behind oh they do good yes great

after they you see us Gus actually

picked up one of the coins and just sort

of inspecting him can we ask for some

more details before they leave like how

much money did they need so the burned

one Kaz grid is done talking as far as

far as that was concerned but the other

ones will say that the seven dwarven

clans represented by those seven discs

have gotten together and through

divination spells not only were able to

find where DF would be on a given day

and so that they could actually

intercept him but also divined through

their gods that he might come into

contact with a large trove they don't

know really much detail beyond that but

you get the impression they want it all

they know it's dwarven that it's

originally gold taken from dwarven mines

fashioned into coins

they don't they don't know anything more

than that other than DF will have a hand

and possibly finding some of it okay

that's simple enough whatever he finds

he gives to you I mean that CF does that

seem fair to you yes I think this is all

just very sensible and of course we want

to help those families right yes the

death gobble-gobble star song the elf

sort of comes over to you after all of

this heady business and he says wow you

made enemies of an entire race of people

and you've only been here what a day can

we help you in any way

death will solemnly collect up the stone

coins yep

just kind of like look upon them yeah in

his hand what do those mean they're

dwarven house insignia says dabble I've

seen them a few times why did they leave

them with us as proof that their claim

is sincere that they are emissaries of

the clans involved

Keith will just say well if you need

anything don't hesitate to ask yeah yeah

defection won't say anything like if

that deaath was kind of like not even

making eye contact we'll just kind of

give him a kind of quick nod just

alright some time passes things have

chilled out enough time has passed that

Magnus is able to find his way back to

the yawning portal there are pockets of

levity around Magnus but the table

around which the waffle crew is

currently gathered there is no levity

there is a black cloud hanging over it

Strix is just bringing back food to the

table and waffles is basically following

every step that she makes back and forth

to kitchen basically just getting

anything that Strix accidentally drops

on the floor she scoops up needs know if

anyone's eaten the food or if it's just

sad I'm not sure she's it's probably

good food but it's all just arrayed in

like sad faces so can i before I get

over the table kind of like ask the

bartender like so what's what happened

what what what's going on Durnan says a

bunch of dwarfs showed up gave that guy

hell blamed him for a bunch of deaths

and then left blamed him for a bunch of

deaths yeah I think reasoned apparently

apparently he's the one who released

mogera the dawn titan the fire

primordial that's assailing the north oh

when you say so man use crosses to the

table that's a lot to bear on those thin

shoulders dear

[Laughter]

I need to talk to you outside

the DF will just rise from his seat and

silently go with Magnus jerks is gonna

rats after them okay rats got a lab so

it does that leave just Eaglin and

paltin at the tea house Alton still

hiding invisible

he's probably I don't know Paul I unand

Isabel yeah so so dad gets up and leaves

with Magnus Strix just rats away and

we're just like there's food mom is like

oh hey evil and Mullens forgotten about

you at least for the moment than his

upstairs having drinks with the big half

giant guy they're friends now

so DF I heard a little bit about what

happened but it seems that you were

responsible for a whole lot of deaths

innocent deaths

I assume yeah you're correct how are you

doing what how are you I dislike starts

like getting really introspective this

moment because he's not really sure if

this has ever been asked of him really

before you know when I was a lot younger

literally from my point of view a

century ago my first adventure with my

friends we up and in the end a

city full of people died no one survived

because of us and it took me a long time

to come to terms with it and even longer

to understand what it meant to be okay

with it it's hard I know that it is let

me tell you something that I wish I had

known when I was young you don't balance

the scales you can never save enough

people to feel okay with it

every day is a new day to do good don't

do good out of a feeling of debt or

guilt do good because you are still

alive and you can do it because it's the

right thing to do part of who you are is

what you did and that will never change

and your friends love you and they'll

accept it you are who you are

this isn't separate from this this is a

part of you and if they love you they'll

accept you that's what I wish I had

known when I was your age death goes to

speak and say something back but rather

than no words can come out of the breath

instead it just keeps getting choppy as

tears start streaming down his face and

he literally just drops down to his

hands and knees and just cries Magnus

hugs him yeah you just just still going

the rats the rats hug both of them the

writers are very slowly being too swarm

over them and just cling to their their

clock it's a cry or he's not just sad

he's really like

both screaming out this sorrow that he's

been holding on to for so long like he's

literally just trying like screaming out

as much as possible that's we're gonna

stop

[Music]

I'm so sad it's like pretty sad all

right so that's our show for this week
