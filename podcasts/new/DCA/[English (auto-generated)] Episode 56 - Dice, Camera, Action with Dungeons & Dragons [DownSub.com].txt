you

and we are live for the latest episode

of dice camera action

yay welcome back everybody and those of

you who are new thanks for joining us

for the first time my name is Chris

Perkins and this is the waffle crew and

the last time we left them they had been

born back to the dark domain of burrow

via by Paul Tain's shadow which had been

left behind and which contained a shred

of the vampire strawed bonds are ovitch

in a climactic confrontation in the

chapel of castle Ravenloft paltin

fulfilling a prophecy dealt to him by

Madame Ava at the start of the campaign

took the Sun sword and drove its radiant

blade into the shadow destroying it and

blowing straud away forever

in that moment and in the moments

thereafter reality started to do weird

things and the waffle crew found itself

flickering between the the rainy

encroaching knight and stormy morovia

and a bright sunlit morning in a version

of the castle that seemed to be from the

days of yore and just before they

shifted wholly over to this other time

their wizard acquaintance Morden Kanan

thrust a bunch of items into Evelyn's

hands things he knew they might need in

the future

and then he faded away now

evylyn and paltin ran out of the chapel

because the roof started to collapse

well then start to collapse it collapsed

and so they are deeper in the castle now

in a hallway and when they look back

they can see that the dark rainy chap

has switched over to brilliant morning

lit Chapel no sign of the devastation

that they just ran away from meanwhile

outside the chapel in the rose gardens

behind it

DF and Strix were beset by a bunch of

flying brooms and Strix actually got

yanked away by one was basically pulled

through the air by it and she tried to

tame it but it wouldn't be tamed DF was

protecting waffles whom he just saved

from a precarious fall and had been

surrounded by the brooms when Strix cast

a dispel magic on them and they all

clattered to the ground except the one

of course that she couldn't control but

that one seeing what she had done to its

broom buddy is decided to cozen up to

her and become her friend so now she has

a broom and in that is whiskey whiskey

and sure paulten approves and in that

moment isaac confronted DF and warned

him to stay away from Strix calling him

lorca 'this scum whatever that means and

Strix bravely oddly enough flew in

between isaac and DF and said the

immortal lines the waffle crew is my

family defying her brother and that's

when they shifted out of the reality

that they were in to a new reality that

finds them in a morning lit rose garden

not dead like the one you just left but

live and lush and brilliant with roses

of varying hue and you are suddenly

overcome with the smells of spring and

the smell of roses in which you find

yourselves the rusted wrought iron fence

that surrounds the rose garden is no

longer rusted but actually looks quite

new and as you guys stand there in the

morning light still wet from the rain

you hear a sort of a singsong hum from

somewhere in the Rose Garden and quickly

sort of pinpointed to a figure who is

hunched over and picking roses and as

she sort of stands up and sniffs one of

the roses that she just picked you can

see that she bet she is

arena kalyana great she's dressed in

this just this almost like a riding

outfit and yes she is picking roses from

the garden and has not yet noticed your

presence well I'm really really allergic

to all of these plants because it's just

not gonna start stiffly like when you do

that arena here's you for the first time

turns toward you with some surprise and

then the surprise on her face is quickly

masked with an expression meant to be a

little bit less startled and a little

bit more friendly and open it's clear

that she doesn't know who you are and

you're not there you guys are you to her

in the castle right yeah yeah so it's

just tricks death and waffles at the

moment and yes thanks Trix will

awkwardly try to yeah and she says are

you servants of the Duchess yes and did

she send you to the gardens

yeah yeah mm-hmm flowers for the wedding

no doubt yes yes and I start like

strictly picking up like just putting

flowers like in her robes like but

sneezing like they smell way too good

all right yes and Arina sort of walks

over to a basket on the ground where

there's some more picked flowers and

brings it over to you and just sort of

puts it on the ground in front of you so

that you can actually layer flowers in

that instead and she says a good bounty

this year there are more than enough for

our needs has there always been flowers

here she says well I haven't been here

very long but where how long have you

been here I is your name Arena right

tatianna oh I just look back at deaath

like hey making eyes this old really

awkward and then she sort of leans in

sort of smiling it says I'm the bride

congratulations we're quite excited for

you we'd better just keep picking

flowers tricks that was the girl puts

like more flowers in the basket she sort

of seems surprised that you don't know

but then when she regains her composure

again she says his name is Sergei he's

very handsome oh yeah he's but a luckier

man keep him close oh I intend to

she says since you are obviously new

arrivals here perhaps you two have a

chance to meet him later oh that would

that would be wonderful when is the

wedding tomorrow morning oh good we

still have plenty of time for

reparations mm-hmm she says yes and I

think we've got enough flowers now

perhaps we should head inside I can help

you find your mistress good flowers more

flowers he says is that a dog

[Laughter]

this is waffles she's harmless worry not

she's very faithful all right

waffles we'll make some sounds and then

just start kind of running around the

garden in sort of mad energy depleting

circles glad she's enjoy someone's

enjoying them there's a butterfly as she

can chase yeah that yeah in fact she

probably does find a butterfly a bright

yellow butterfly that she can leap and

bound after you don't see this even

evylyn what you do see is morning light

streaming through the stained-glass

windows of the chapel that you just left

leaving colorful patterns on the floor

so bright and brilliant as to be of a

like you've never seen even in even in

church as you visited in the past and

through the open doors you can smell

hints of incense and also see that there

are tapestries with Sun

iconography upon them yes this hallway

that you and paltin are standing in has

armored statues of knights lining it

they're all made of kind of a white

alabaster and there's another set of

doors at the far end of the hall that

opened up and coming through it looks

like they were opened up by a pair of

servants and then coming through the

doors making her way toward the chapel

and you is a heavyset woman quite big

her face done up with makeup in a style

that almost makes her look like a

waxwork doll and she's gotten draped

over her clothes a law a heavy quilt

that kind of drags on the floor behind

her and it looks like it's not a fashion

statement she's trying to make here she

must have a chill or using the quilt to

fight off the castles draft or the

morning cold and I'm just holding like a

seven and a quarter foot pull yeah

there's a butter melt yes yes and this

woman is coming toward you and paltin

with purpose although she at first she

needs to be looking past you toward the

chapel there's something about her that

suggests aristocracy and it seems to be

her reflex not to look into the eyes of

servants and at first blush you think

that's what she thinks you are the two

of you it looks like she's gonna blow

right past you if you don't stop her or

or do anything uh I think that I don't

stop her I think I just kind of am

frozen motionless trying to figure out

what's going on here paltin do you want

to do anything to stop this large woman

yes all right what do you I'm gonna I'm

gonna say hey when you do that she turns

to you with a look of scorn and

indignance like how dare you interrupt

her morning purpose and but then as she

fixes her eyes upon you and kind of sees

that you're carrying weird instruments

and things she smiles and says are you

the Bard of Burrus that I've heard so

much about she's talking to me repulsive

paltin

say yep that's me

so you will be performing at tonight's

dinner yes absolutely looking forward to

it

where's that Jesus here in the castle oh

cool

you don't know where you are you're lost

perhaps um as as per day before a bar

bar de preparations I may have forgotten

a few details

she says this is very important much

more important than talking to the

Father I'll do that anytime how about I

take you to a place where you can

practice and set up your motor sounds

wonderful they have a conservatory here

you know and then she notices evylyn

your companion for the first time small

small little evylyn and she and then her

eyes grow wide like it's the most

marvelous thing she's seen in her adult

life and then she reaches out evylyn and

just pokes at her hopes you in Avalon on

the forehead and says is original Vaughn

we just sort of tapping your forehead

evylyn like she's not expecting you to

react

it's like yep that is correct remarkable

I have one you know we have one word is

gift for for the war for the beautiful

Kabul couple right the bride and Colonel

of Sergei and Tatiana Oh even hears this

and decides that it's probably best to

just like go along with this too so she

starts acting extra robotic like super

chunky bound she's like my lady what may

I call you she she freaks out and

screams in the hall and after letting

out a scream she puts her hands on

evilman's face and then takes him off

and then puts her hands on your face

Paulette and says

how do you get it to talk mine does not

even just like smiles motionless like

sepia is some sort of magic sure flan

even takes the buttermilk and holds it

out would you like some buttermilk

she kind of looks at it suspiciously

kind of smells it she says well it

smells all right I will try and then Wow

god I hope she doesn't die it's very

good very good

I'm sure it was here we go little

servant construct yeah

it's about half empty even opens like a

compartment and shoves it she and so uh

and then she says I am Duchess door

phanie Atalissa

a friend of the family's door just don't

I'm so glad I'm not there right now

pleasure like well I am uh I'm paulten

and this is the robot what is robot so

you were saying there is a wedding yes

and I'm sure you're tired after long

trip from Perez I take you upstairs now

okay we talked on the way sure sure sure

and she says aren't you cold I'm

freezing she bundles herself up a bit I

cannot get cold

all right and the Duchess will lead you

up into the castle when she goes back

the way she came the doors open

she basically knocks on the doors and

then two servants open them up revealing

the grand foyer of the castle where what

you arrived with Morden Kanan once and

battled some gargoyles and slew the dusk

elf Chamberlain raha Dean now it is

spotless shiny and not a cobweb to be

seen and from there she takes you

upstairs you can see that there are

servants bustling around everywhere

running around almost like chickens with

their heads cut off feverishly trying to

get things ready some of them have

tapestries under their arms some of them

have candelabra candlesticks candelabras

that they're shuffling around with

others are moving around with plates

others are carrying what appear to be

covered dishes upstairs possibly to

guests you don't know but the place is

absolutely alive as opposed to dead

which is how you're accustomed to seeing

it and she leads you up the stairs up a

spiral staircase into various rooms and

you sort of disappear into the interior

around the same time that Tatiana

outside is suggesting that maybe she can

lead Strix and DF into the castle where

they might be tended to will follow her

or I'll follow her idea but I want to

see if there's any any plants that I

recognize as poisonous or anything I can

use as a poison anywhere um here in the

Rose Garden not so much but you you

might see some other plants and other

gardens back here that you can pilfer

all right if you want to stop and just

start ripping them out yes please

okay anything that looks remotely that I

could make a poison out of at this point

Tatiana sort of confides in DF and says

hmm I thought she was a maid she is

she's also quite particular about

what flowers and plants are on display

she's actually quite the expert in her

field and I simply humbly request that

you trust her and her expertise they

should a look at Strix alright there's

an awkward moment where tatiana india

they're forced to wait while Strix is

being kind of choosy and selective right

it comes back with a bunch of plan and

then there's like one wait one weed

where she can't get it out of the ground

and she starts fighting with it and

cursing at it threatening to put a hex

on it yeah all right cool

so do I get any poisonous plants yes you

get three poisonous plants yes which you

think would you think that in order to

use the poison either after

force-feeding him the plant or mix it in

with something perfect alright

and then she will lead you around the

castle to a servants entrance and slip

you in that way d/f or sorry evylyn and

palton you're led upstairs to a chamber

that's you that you had passed through

in in old castle borough via you can see

that a table has been moved into the

center of the room and a space has been

cleared in the middle and you here you

can see a couple servants disappear as

soon as the duchess shows up they leave

the room promptly they bow to her as

they leave and pushed around the edges

of the room you can see there is a giant

harp and a stand that looks like it's

designed to hold a lute or a guitar or

some other stringed instrument but

there's nothing currently in it and you

can see in another corner what appears

to be a zither

and some other old instruments and the

Duchess will lead you through a door

into a bath chamber and through there

into the master suite

she says no one is going to need this

room and it's probably quieter than the

the conservatory looks like they're

redressing it for the wedding cake

this'll work you can see there's a tall

canopy bed quite large there is a

free-standing mirror there are

decorative suits of armor a big rug on

the floor you can also see that there is

a large wrapped present standing by the

door near some suitcases that present is

beautifully decorated it's got a big bow

on the front it stands about four feet

four and a half feet high and is about

two two and a half feet wide and deep it

looks like it might be a wrapped trunk

or something standing on its end and she

says I will reach up to the servants and

have them bring you some beverages but I

will make sure that they knock first so

as not to disturb you unnecessarily that

would be fantastic

and then she will leave through the way

she came now near the present the

wrapped present on the suitcases are a

pair of double doors that you know lead

to strods library and study those doors

are slightly ajar and through those

doors you can hear someone playing a

lute but the doors aren't open enough

that you can see them there is a great

window across from those doors that

looks out over the front of the castle

and you can hear outside out front what

sounds like marching like soldiers

information I look at Politan and I'm

like are you actually gonna play I mean

I think it'd be awesome if you play it I

really like it when you play music if it

helps us then sure also second question

okay what happens if we kill straw in

the past I feel like we might have

skipped a few questions we felt like we

were in the past maybe we don't we don't

know where we are but I'm ready to take

it back you felt you feel like you're in

a different time for sure because

everything that you're surrounds you

looks like Castle Ravenloft at its in

its heyday all the furniture is

beautifully maintained all the wood

paneling on the walls is flawless

there's no dust no cobwebs all the

chandeliers are clear this is clearly

Castle Ravenloft from a different time

okay I take that back and I'm like a

better timeline than that what happened

I don't know I stabbed a shadow and then

like went haywire wow it's opened

up in the ceiling fell in and it was it

was it was crammed I told you that sword

was powerful thank you I've learned that

[Laughter]

I just asked like do you like do you

hear that like that it sounds like it

sounds like music do that door yeah

should we go see who it is starts going

toward it I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna do

that you sort of poke your heads out

scooby-doo style yeah all right mhm

when you look into this

study you can see that in front of the

fireplace which has a fire in it there

is two overstuffed chairs you know that

from before and there are other

furnishings in here as well but they're

all sort of beautiful and new and the

sound of the music is coming from one of

those overstuffed chairs you can't see

the figure playing but you can sort of

see one arm and hand on the end of what

appears to be a lute and and it's

probable it looks like it's a man is

playing that instrument while looking at

the fire now above the mantel where you

knew there was a giant framed portrait

of Tatiana that portrait is gone and

what you see above the mantel instead is

a gigantic mirror that sort of increases

or gives the impression that the room is

much larger than it was before

there are also lit candelabras from the

ceiling which gives you enough light

around the room to see that seated at

the desk listening to the music but not

really paying attention to it is a woman

who you think is probably avestan e

given her olive complexion and her dark

hair in fact she looks strikingly

similar in many ways to your old friend

Esmeralda and she is seated at the desk

with a deck of cards and is kind of

drawing them and laying them out on the

tabletop and there's a little lit candle

beside her and a cat a living breathing

cat sort of on another corner of the

desk looking down at the floor and we

can't see in the mirror who's playing

the lute the angle of the mirror does

not allow you to see who that is

I'm going in paulten hold on

so they don't notice us yet right no

okay

evylyn start shuffling in c-3po style

and she walks over to the lady and says

alright you're out your head is actually

a bit lower than the desk so it's it

like you just sort of got this little

bobbing head above the edge of the desk

yeah it's it's a it's a huge oak desk

yes yeah you can serve if you sort of

stand up in your toes you can look over

your nose is basically above the level

of the desk and yes when you do the

woman stops drawing cards and I'd like

you to make a perception check for me

she's like walking and you you've never

seen this young woman before but you can

see that her left hand as she sort of

holds a card up the card facing her not

you that she has a ring on one finger

with a red stone and it is the same ring

worn by Madame Ava

ah does she look like she could be she

looks like she could be a young version

of Madame Ava even takes a gamble and

she says my lady Eva and she looked up a

little bobbing pal

she says my name is Katerina but if is

nice name would you care for

refreshments

at that point in time the music stops

and sort of peering around the chair

toward you evil and with some annoyance

I might add is a young man probably the

same age as the woman at the desk or

there abouts certainly within five years

of each other with straw blonde hair and

a very sort of thin Van Dyck blond beard

same color hair and same color eyes as

paltin does he look like Paulson

anywhere just the same color you would

think a family resemblance and you can

see he's got over the eye that's looking

at you he's got a scar like somebody

caught him with a sword above the eye

and sort of took off part of his eyebrow

but it's healed it's it's a it's an old

scar probably something that happened in

his youth is uncaged mastani youth do I

see him and that's the first time you

see him palton it's like yeah it's it's

could be could be your long-lost brother

he ones eyes kind of like her little you

know her little construct I was gonna go

pray for you but then she keeps her

composure and she says I am your new

servant construct I would bring you

refreshments Alton do you do anything

I'm just kind of like staring at him

like looks familiar huh

evylyn shuffles over to him and you my

lord

enter name please he sort of sets the

lute down on the chair stands up and

kneels down kind of to your level

because he's he's tall and also five two

aren't I

I thought you were actually shorter than

that but never mind yeah you are but for

some reason I for some reason I fall

asleep

remembered that we were actually under

five feet but but wait so he will he

will kind of bow down to you and extend

his hand in friendship basically trying

to shake your construct hand great he

extends a hand yes high go and he says

greetings pretty one

I'm yes Bret yes / thank you do you care

for refreshment and then he looks up at

Catarina behind a desk and says it's

remarkable isn't it who made this and

Catarina says that construct is not what

it seems when she lays down a card and

then she draws another one and she says

it is from a different time

she says understands like this and then

she draws another card looks at it and

says a time that I may yet live to see

and then she draws another card this one

was not always what she appears to be

and then yes Bertie more intrigue is

like really was she alive she looks just

like Alton and yeah do I hear all of

this yes I'm just understanding in the

back like and he says to you even you

can talk but do you drink no thank you

it's at this point where some of the the

buttermilk starts to seep out from your

compartment and run down and run down

your leg and you don't notice it until

you hear it go sort of plip plop plop

down on the floor because you have no

feeling and then and then it looks down

at the floor at the puddle of buttermilk

and says apparently it can you can see

that it's the bottle is sort of fallen

on its side inside of you so when you

kind of open up a compartment if there's

just sort of like this sploosh clumsy me

I will return and starts to try to leave

we're gonna have to hose her out yeah

that's gonna spoil real fun so gross

I'm trying to depart Oh like a robot

like c-3po I'm like oh I gotta go clean

that up

are you going in just a random direction

or are you going back

someone toward the door toward pulpit

okay I'm trying to to return with the

information I have gathered okay

Tatiana leads Strix and DF up a

staircase that spirals around the inside

of a very large wide Tower and when she

gets to an open doorway leading out onto

the battlements and can hear what sounds

like horse hooves she says oh come with

me you have to see this we'll see it

together and then she sort of grabs you

both by the hands and kind of pulls you

along and she says my so Gaius returns

great saluted and he rushes down the

battlements and from up here outside you

can see out on to the walls of Castle

Ravenloft and see that there are guards

on the walls that you never saw before

dressed in their gleaming armor and

carrying their spears and crossbows and

as you make your way around the

battlements toward the front of the

castle you get a view of the front

courtyard the courtyard between the keep

on which you stand and the gatehouse

out front with the drawbridge and

entering the courtyard having just

galloped across the drawbridge are three

figures on horseback the one in the lead

is straud alive and in the flesh he is

riding a great black stallion looks

remarkably similar to the the flame

hoofed flame maned one that he rode as

undead but this black stallion is now

alive and behind him and strawed is

wearing his fur mantled cloak he's got a

sword at his side and all the regalia

you'd expect of a kingly figure

and his stirrups sort of gleam in the

morning and then behind him on a

beautiful white and brown horse is a

younger man who could be his brother

dressed in light gleaming armor and with

what appears to be a table art or symbol

of the morning Lord on his chest and he

carries a golden hilted he has a golden

hilted sword by his side and he whereas

strawed and his features suggest a man

carved by war this younger brother

figure is somehow in his posture and the

way he holds his reins in the way he

just presents himself a much lighter

figure untempered and a smile on his

face

a happiness to be back home and then the

third figure that you see is maybe some

sort of guard or guard captain you don't

recognize because he's under a helm and

seems to be accompanying the brothers on

their return and as they enter the

courtyard and approach the entrance they

stop and begin to dismount and a bevy of

servants pour out of the castle doors

below you to tend to their need now in

the castle courtyard you can see lines

of soldiers that have just been marching

here now moved to formation to greet

their Lord in a very formal way and some

of them have banners that have the

Ravenloft Peruvian crest on them and

others are just standing with their

swords drawn held up to their chests

perfectly silent the lead following the

servants out into the courtyard and

greeting the king and his brother is

raha Dean the palace Chamberlain

the dusk elf whose screams echoed

through your mind and haunted your soul

who you killed in the castle

alive and well he takes trod by the hand

and then they have a conversation that

you can't hear and tatianna has perched

on the battlements looking down and

points to her beloved Sergei and says

that is my groom isn't he beautiful

very handsome uses dashing dashing yes

- she's dashingly handsome it's so

dashing that you should yes he is so

full of life so full of life he is he

was raised in the teachings of the

morning Lord we have a friend that was

raised the teachings of the morning Lord

they talk about it all the time and they

talk about it all the time he does talk

quite often this is all quite wonderful

and we cannot wait for your grand Sarah

Paulsen shadows seem to fall in the room

behind you and that's because when you

look past

evylyn who's marching toward you back

into the room in which you stand there

are figures standing outside the window

on the battlements that you never saw

before one seems to be although you

can't tell just by looking at her back

Arina kalyana reborn the other two are

very familiar to you your companions DF

and Strix they've got their backs to the

great window of the master bed chamber

you're pretty sure they won't be able to

hear you through the glass you'd have to

open the window and there at this

distance you know this room is huge

Aaron is about 40 feet away I'm gonna

like I nudged evylyn but I feel like I'd

hurt myself

you make it back to the doors where

paltin is currently standing behind so

they just the two in the room just

allowed me to say yeah the the man just

sort of started laughing at you and and

the woman looks at you and just sort of

says most puzzling I see them outside of

the window so I'm just gonna like like

pinky ones head just like I mean I'm

just gonna plant the window bay yes you

can see as Irena turns in profile to

speak to DF and Strix and you can see

her more clearly yes it is indeed straw

it's bride risen from the grave or some

facsimile I don't know what do we do did

he do I feel like I've seen him before

um without a real closeup look a little

hard tail but I'm gonna have you make a

perception check okay that would be an 8

definite family resemblance but you

don't you can't say you know he's

somebody you met in your lifetime okay

it's like I didn't I didn't get a good

look at him side or no it's very it's

uncanny but but with the outside and I'm

getting decision fatigue I don't know

what to do it's a it's at that point

that the present the wrapped present

which is only about five feet away from

you standing just inside the the master

bed chamber kind of shakes

[Laughter]

can we hear them screaming now dying oh

and now the box is moving and why is the

Bach archive I don't like this time like

at this point I think that I have enough

evidence that even says I think we are

in the past okay what about the moving

box that I'm still really concerned

about do you want me to stab it maybe

we'll put it we'll put a pin in that

what if there's a puppy in it greater

good okay so the question is find the

essence tricks because I think that

should probably be a priority don't

forget he points across the room or

through the giant windows and you see

the backs of DF constricts looking out

down upon the courtyard below alright

cool one out of three done what's next

look at the box I'm just like okay let's

go but it's not our box that's very very

morally mature well well I was gonna say

this that makes it even more tempting

alright here's the plan and before I say

AP I'm just gonna walk over and open the

box so you sort of tear open the

wrapping paper to

like okay I try and like like you know

kid who found their president okay I

will let you make a dexterity sleight of

hand check if you don't have the

sleight-of-hand skill it's just the

dexterity check okay you should be good

at this

ten okay so this is not rocket science

so yeah you're able to very carefully

remove the wrapping paper without

tearing it and you sort of undo the

ribbon in a way that would allow it to

be tied back up again and so the

wrapping paper just kinda gets folded

and falls away exposing a box kind of an

unremarkable pine but well-fitted box

with sort of a shiny varnish and you can

see that it's got clasps but not locks

so you can just basically unclasp the

lid it's almost like a little little

standing coffin before I do that I'm

gonna like knock on it okay how many

knocks just like a little just like

little here back my attorney gave them

like there's something in there alright

when you open it you see that it's lined

with well the first thing that happens

is a bunch of peanuts fall out basically

some some stuffing falls onto the ground

and you can see that the interior of the

box is lined with purple velvet to sort

of soften its inside in that there is

all this sort of what looks like

feathers and pillow stuffing or sheep's

wool in here but nested inside the

cavity

is Simon now there's a couple a couple

one one minor difference is that this

isn't these sort of beat-up old

deteriorated you're rotting away Jester

Costume Simon this is freshly painted

waxed polished Simon all of his clothes

are pristine

the colors are pristine all the bells

are on his jester hat you can see that

the suit made jack-o'-lantern makeup

that was on his face is not there and

it's more of you know

a well painted face still kind of

clownish and freakish in a way but I

like drop my knees oh yes oh yeah you

start here around the corner of the lid

and yes you see Simon all right yes he

will sort of come walking out of the box

with some of the the packing material

kind of still stuck to him and then he

just sort tries to get it off like that

scream let's scream death and Strix I'm

going to let you make perception checks

24 okay Strix you do not hear it over

the sound of the ruckus below but DF

through the big giant window behind you

you hear evil ins Mecca scream alright

like look back assuming that it's her in

some kind of danger yeah you have a hard

time looking through the window at first

you kind of have to put your hands like

right up to it cover your eyes and go

right up to look inside but when you do

you're looking into the master bedroom

Castle Ravenloft and on the far side of

the room

near some ajar giant doors you see

paltin kind of on the ground

evylyn kind of freaking out and a figure

that is unmistakeably murder bot oh no

ok so looks like they just unwrapped

somebody's present so from that camera

viewpoint of justice is right there do

you just like jump off the balcony you

should go see your husband-to-be alright

stay away from his brother ok so yeah

you pull you pull Strix away you have

some parting words with tatianna and

where is it that you DF intend to take

Strix at this point towards the vague

direction that I saw evil and pölten to

stop this okay

you have you have two options you can

either run around the castle and look

for another window that you can get into

or a door those are possibilities or you

can try using your thieving ability to

open the open of all parts of this

window from the outside essentially use

your thieves tools to try to flip a

catch or two and because it looks like

the this master window does have

swinging out parts how entranced she

would notice a brand new eyes and be

like I can distract there if you want me

to or you think it would not be much to

convince her to go down and meet her

beloved in the look in the downstairs I

do that there's like oh you should go

meet up with him she she she asks you to

make sure she must make sure you're

alright you'll be able to find your way

we certainly are we'll take these

flowers and Aimee and I will continue

the preparation Oh she'll take me me

she'll take it

she'll take one of the flowers out and

just sort of cradle it and you can tell

just by looking her face that she's

going to give it to Sergei

and then she hastens off and disappears

leaving you by the window

Amy great all right paltin and evylyn

you can hear the window frame kind of

shake and C D F up in the window

basically using these tools to flip it

open go make your dexterity sleight of

hand check yes okay so as dia flips the

Catchpole news to open another one right

next to him like get in here yeah

all right you are once more United dear

son I don't think he's happy about that

yeah I'm yeah I'm so ecstatic for you

I'm gonna make sure all the other doors

to this room is closed and just close

them all up okay right now done you are

now you know hermetically sealed in the

master bedroom reven loft right great

know just what you wanted I know we're

back in time as well right well we

figured that out mostly yes based on all

the evidence you've seen you are clearly

at an earlier time before the fall of

burrow via all right I will also tell

them that strata is outside we just saw

him walk in just so you guys smell I got

some poison plants though so yes you did

and I need you to throw those away no no

no listen I know we know but you know

what's going on here we can't do

anything yes we can

no but if we do anything everything gets

all whack what whole person stuff plants

in mouth mash them up run that could

change everything

Oh Jake completely changed the history

of everything that happened here it

could change everything in other planes

makes is

since who knows it could make it you

could sue in such a change that we may

never meet was never born here that

would be sad but maybe it doesn't work

like that do I know if it works like

that

Makana check could see if you skipped

temporal mechanics did I I didn't 21

alright so the study of time and the

magical ability to manipulate time aka

chrono Mansi is a very underappreciated

and under studied segment of arcane

magical lower button with your roll

Strix oh boy and your understanding and

experiences in burrow via first of all

you're not altogether sure what

propelled you back here short of

possible divine intervention this this

would this would this would this is

either the work of gods or somebody

using some kind of wish spell or

something very very very powerful be

burrow via from all you that you know

was kind of pulled out of its native

realm to the shadow fell and trapped

there after straw became a vampire so if

you're in burrow via could be in

wherever burrow via actually came from

or you are in a version of burrow via

that is sort of locked in time almost

like a part that's played over and over

and over again ad infinitum that kind of

led to the creation of the domain of

burrow via that you know and despise so

much in which case that whatever happens

here may not necessarily echo or resound

out into the greater world but could

have consequences for the future of

burrow via and burrow via alone right so

our experiences won't go away right so

you think potentially let's say for

instance you were to I don't know

kill Stroud

and strawed never actually gets around

to killing his brother and causing the

death of his brother's bride

it is possible based on your role that

the consequences for burrow via would be

profound ie it would never sink into

darkness and its people would not be

lost would that change who you are or

say who paltin is who has ties to burrow

via it might but it wouldn't erase you

all right well I will articulate all of

my schooling apparently there I wasn't

just drawing rats and bats likely likely

your experiences and what you know would

never change

alright so I'll tell them that and I'll

also make sure to look poignant Liat

evil him and say a power brought us here

yes probably to do some good you like

that right he learns like kind of like

not she's she's not looking at you she

kind of nods she's kneeling she's

kneeling on the floor and she's looking

really closely at Simon or at Simon and

just kind of like looks like they're

gonna kick her over shoots at her arm

and then she looks at Simon and then she

looks at her chest and then she looks at

sudden she's like mind blowing right now

misterx is so mad that she's not

listening to this Simon is kind of like

yeah yeah yeah Simon or whatever he

thinks he is looks you up and down to

evylyn sort of comparing contrasting but

he doesn't say anything nor based on the

way his mouth is built does it seem like

he could say anything

you can't talk the more important

situation right now is how do we get

back oh I don't know if I know that I

pretty much a power someone powerful

enough to be a power a God yet let the

end on it it could have been the dark

powers we don't know they are also a

power but it was a fan that's a good

call

tomorrow is Tatiana's wedding to say

okay

and during the wedding itself

when strawed murder sir day and that's

when tatiana throws herself off of the

castle right no whiskey and I can save

her if that happens and you're saying it

might be a good thing to completely

change the outcome yes we can save the

people of borough BIA we can make it so

that they never have to be burro vo they

never have to be sad that never has to

happen but Evelyn perks up at this and

she's like we can't let's do that but

there is a small possibility that

everything we haven't know about each

other

no no that's there's no possibility

we'll be fine I know it's fine and we

had a diamond now meanwhile while she

says she knows magic she's gonna press

agitation the buttermilk out of e blanks

it's gross okay thank you

nice you're welcome it might like I

don't know stick your gears or whatever

is in there I don't know I don't either

so pretty much what I'm trying to say it

won't change anything that happened to

us and it might change palton

considering that that you know palton is

from here

wait what change politic that's paltin

yeah what change paltin jerks will try

and explain its a palton but she'll use

way smaller words yes please I just got

reunited with my dead son so I'm kind of

going through a lot he is not your son

what's not just pulled him loose tricks

with Indies ik I personally I would like

to forget about that just anyone

disagree I don't know I don't I don't

disagree but I don't know worst case

scenario if I forget the best-case

scenario I forget it fault in reacting

to this he fell to his knees that been

like is he fine or is he I'm just like

there's a lot going on

I'm trying my best to keep up like what

if we did we change things or whatever

and we give whisked back hopefully to

when when we were rare we were what

guarantee we had that will still even be

together that will still know each other

the fact that I know magic

well dia would you put us knowing each

other over the lives of all of those

burro beings and the suffering they went

through yeah I would be one kind of nods

and I didn't expect that answer but it's

thoughtful look at everything that

happened here has already happened I'm

not sure root can't or are supposed to

change that well if you really want to

know and you don't trust my opinion you

can always ask your sword yeah I don't

recall D F ever saying here's my sword

Evelyn would you like to meet strict

sense of course yeah strikes will be

late yeah so Dan has the sword and it's

so much a mishmash smushed America

that's an art can a lot she's very

powerful she's from sigil that's where

I'm from

and then if we really wanted to go we

could probably just like to open it and

jump through the portal but I really

don't think that's a good idea so we

should never ever ever do that that's

what she apparently will answer

questions just for DIA though but she's

really mean and she tried to sell me as

a slave once or buy me as a slave I'm

sorry yeah she sucks yes she's the worst

that sword sounds amazing

I'm kind of jealous what song should use

it please stop Alton kind of regains his

composure like stands back up mm-hmm

like look there's a lot going on there's

a lot to take in

I'm still not sure what's going on and I

want to alarm anybody but I'm pretty

sure we've been sent to a different time

[Laughter]

listen listen we had to kill straud

we've killed Stroud we killed strut

again whatever power wanted us here

wants us to kill strawed again one last

time that's what we need to do stretch

do you wholly believe that this is what

we're supposed to do yes why else would

we be here cool let's do it evylyn the

doors to the room rattle somebody is I

mean hugs draw not somebody sort of

grabbed grab the handle and realize the

door has been locked and ER send me back

for this express purpose and we must

kill strong also cottons dad I think is

it there you hear the rattling Keys okay

do you feel like kind of take a brief

swallow to himself and give a quick nod

and save for save to you we can't use

our real names

strikes your doors open and you see a

figure standing in the doorway in front

of you as that as this double door parts

right in front of you near the open

present and the pile of luggage the

figure standing in is instantly

recognizable as the dusk Alfre Haddon

immediately wiping the window with his

glove just Simon just turns his head to

hundred and odd degrees around and just

kind of doesn't move his body but just

looks toward the Chamberlain who takes

you all in in an instant and he snaps

his fingers and orders you happen or

does also yep nice ice cutter like a

cockroach the lights and you're close

enough to him that you know normally

last time you were this close to raha

Dean you heard the screams

around him there's none of that I like I

like remember that and like walk by him

and then like stop I'm just kind of like

lean in huh evylyn takes like robotic

Lee takes Simons little hand

yeah and tries to like c-3po and r2d2

walk out with them okay you succeed

raha bien turns to you yeah you still

have waffles success waffles nearby

paltin raha Dean turns to you and says I

spoke to the dodges she says you will be

performing at tonight's dinner correct

sir

he says the master is coming you should

find another place to practice can do

and he just sort of he he moves aside to

let you past all the while giving you a

suspicious look I just came I'm like a

alright as you guys exit the room into

the study you see that the the vez tani

woman is gone but she's left her cards

on the desk

yike the man playing the lute is gone

and the lute is still resting on the

chair you'd have to go around to the

chair to pick it up to really get a good

look at it

oh I'm so bummed I wanted to show you

guys these people I think they looked

really familiar yeah it's fine

everything here's bad I don't I go pick

up the loot and I kind of hold it up to

false and I'm like what do you think you

see that in fact it's not a lute it's a

mandolin and it looks like that Oh even

tries to pretend you can make an arc on

a check

oh boy intelligence yeah it was like

when you strum and open guitar it's like

bang bang 15 you believe that this is an

item called a magic item called an

instrument of the bards a famous item

called the kenneth mandolin it

incorporates images of sort of there's a

bit of a Celtic knot motif combined with

images of lightning bolts so cool too

bad we gotta leave it behind it's like

yeah totally

I'm just tuck it away okay this is

totally gonna walk up to those cards for

sure you can see that the cards are

actually left pretty much untouched from

when she just got up but there is a very

distinctive and familiar cross shaped

pattern for cards with a v card in the

middle forming the cross and then the

rest of the stack is off to the side and

those cards are all faced up you see in

the top card position is the two of

swords or the Paladin card in the bottom

position is the Raven card okay starting

to get a picture in being scared the

card to the west or the left is the

master of coins or the rogue card okay

and the card to the east or the right is

the five stars or the elementalist card

and the card between them all is the

three of glyphs or the healer

card who thought it was gonna be deaf

thought it was gonna be death whoo-ha

right um I get Strix kind of gets an

idea of this for sure but uh obviously

we're here to fix this place she's gonna

point out and be like oh look at this

magic on the desk it means we're here to

fix it no thanks already have one all

right but the cards I've already got one

it's fine no no not for you it's this is

good this is a good thing evylyn comes

over and looks and she's like yeah

they're real pretty no one is listening

to me today so I'm just gonna sit on the

floor

[Laughter]

okay straud enters he comes through a

secret door in the corner which you know

has a staircase behind it and the door

just sort of closes quietly behind him

he does not even look at any of you he

just walks across the room to the doors

to his master suite opens them turns

looks into the room where you all stand

or are hiding as the case may be and and

the albear and closes the doors behind

him like he couldn't have given to Fox

make an inside check 18 they're good

eleven thank you

I got it twelve okay the eleven and

twelve is enough to suggest that there's

paltin and Strix you would say that he's

got a look of annoyance

whereas evylyn and DF would say that he

is consumed by other thoughts that he is

so in his head right now that he's not

even really pay

attention to anything else I didn't I

didn't we attack him just now cuz it's

 strong he's odd yet yeah he's

not a vampire the Strada of this era if

if the if what you've been told of your

history of this places is to be counted

on is after his father died after his

father King Bharath died he became the

King apparent though he was never

crowned he never had his coronation and

he picked up his father's sword took

over his father's armies and won all of

his father's remaining Wars driving all

the enemies into the valley at bravia

slaughtering them and then building the

castle here because he thought it was a

very pretty place and a nice place to do

so so this is general estrade king

straud master of armies straud guys how

drunk are you look I don't know you know

the wedding is tomorrow morning we need

a plan when do you want to act well

let's go hey fellas door is right there

well there are lots of other good you

could take your take the mandolin and

scooch and find just another corner of

the castle work to conspire and if you

don't want to be in his study /library

definitely don't know why don't we go

right now no we can't right now we need

a plan we need an actual plan and we

also need to we also we also need to

show that he's the one who's bad if we

start going around just being like up

there dead then like we look like just

straight-up murderers we can't we have

to be like he was planning this all

along you know what I mean right

so you think we should wait until the

actual wedding itself or when he makes

his move

and then interview yes okay I like Strix

this idea the will of Lysander waits for

no one's perception it doesn't matter

what these people think of us it matters

that we do his holy will in the light of

the morning Lord right maybe Simon maybe

Simon just sort of looks at you

quizzically and just

see he's already grown up so smart

look I just got an idea it's a bad idea

let's do it's so bad but it's um okay

it's a wonderful bad idea alright now

you know I can do this and strict so

I'll turn herself into strods brother

said oh if we can capture him and get

him and polymorph him and keep him on us

when we know that strawed murders him I

can be bait and strawed can come after

me and try and kill me he doesn't know I

have magic and I know magic so what we

can do is all of us can be waiting

invisible or otherwise and then as soon

as he comes to kill me as in Strix as

Sergey but not but not certain but Strix

then we jump it and we make Sergey watch

the whole thing like hide him in a

closet or something behind us I'll be

like see he sucks that is a terrible

idea I don't like putting you in danger

but I'm into it this is a terrible idea

all right let's go kidnap him wait so

we're kidnapping Sergey yeah and then

I'll be Sergey I'm still stir gay right

now I'm so handsome you look her out

real nice

I've big muscles also this suddenly

reminds me that we had a date with that

not King who we were supposed to go see

in three days so yes there tend to be

king yes well we're also supposed to get

rewarded but here we are Strix make a

perception check 13 ok ok ok

well I'm still sergey to stand in there

just like hey

we're gonna do all this crazy stuff any

input from it's a bad idea I know but

it's all we have

I like I don't know what else to do

otherwise we just lay in wait and try to

defend Sergey when Stroud decides to

attack I just don't know that we'd be

quick enough in that case yeah

well should we go like do servant Lee

things yeah I think so I already tried

to bring him drinks they didn't want any

look there's a lot of people here I

think we can fake it long enough

tumbling into the room through the

servants door is Sergey and Tatiana and

you can see that Sergei has Tatiana in

his arms and they're sort of they sort

of stumble into the room spinning around

romantically kissing each other and they

sort of bang up against some furniture

and laugh and stop before they realize

there are actually people in the study

for a moment they do they probably would

kind of look at you before your illusion

falls all right I'm just gonna hold my

hands and be like we need to talk to

both of you immediately they they kind

of laugh at you like this is must be

some sort of joke we're from the future

Oh yep yeah change back into Sergei and

do the whole I'm you from the future

thing strikes will change into Sergei

yes and say I'm you from the future

[Laughter]

we've come to warn you that you are in

grave peril

I'm providing dramatic background music

I grabbed Paul by the shoulders how's he

supposed to be surrogate from the

futuristic ties and Jenna says that's

not very funny no it's not funny

you are in grave and and Sergei says I

hope you will have better act for dinner

tonight

oh my god okay the actors crouched down

behind their legs and then that Tatiana

and Sergei sort of look at each other in

both at the same time says theater

performance and say look at them

extremely seriously as Sergei and to say

you Kotter's are gonna die if you don't

listen to us right now we are here to

save you and we need your help

and then she's gonna try and intimidate

them okay go ahead

20:21

you do intimidate them and they suddenly

realize that they are being put sort of

set upon not by any mere entertainer or

musician or whatever by a crazy deranged

person who in whom they become instantly

terrified

you have got their attention he tries to

do like a persuasion type of thing where

she's like hey I'm sorry for my friend

she's just very concerned for your

well-being but we have come indeed to

save you we've been blessed by the

morning Lord with visions of the future

and we know what happens tomorrow we'd

like to say dart from somewhere flies

out and sticks

Tatiana in the neck and then his mouth

closes and she falls over or sort of

falls and then Sergei catches her before

she hits the floor

d/f make a perception check plans

already ruined we have to plan for five

minutes and it's already ruined more all

right

something that Strix didn't notice was

that a couple of some of the cards from

the table had apparently fallen down

onto the floor they're just cards who

cares which cards were they Chris yeah

well when you sort of reach down and

pick them up there are three of them

facedown on the floor you can see the

first card you pick up is the queen of

diamonds and it's the tempter card or

sorry not the queen of diamonds it's

just the tempter card the second card

that you pick up and the tempter card

basically has this woman with a sort of

a fan and yeah very suggestive the

second card is the whip so that's my

spot the second card is the marionette

card great perfect and the third card is

the executioner great that's probably

fine I'm sure this means nothing

sure absolutely even shoves Simon toward

palton like you deal with your son and

that she goes and tries to like lay on

hands on tatianna okay I'm just like

slight subtly disciplines I'm not

certain assignment just sort of turns

his head up at you and stares at you

palton as as evylyn throws herself down

onto Tatiana and attempts to administer

healing now you can see disco

sort of a greenish black discoloration

around her neck that's familiar to you

you you saw Simon shoot the same kind of

dart had a child and kill it all right I

turn to Simon like Simon did you use the

dyed art naive little boy okay this is

bad

can I polymorph Sergei sure all right I

polymorph him into a tiny mouse

what's the save DC mine is a sixteen

okay laying on hands not working when

you lay on hands you can see that she is

dead she's just dead yep she was killed

by the poison we can't find a healer I

bet there's an abbot somewhere so let me

just look up the spell here yeah yeah

it's you touch a creature if it's poison

you neutralize the poison and then she

has advantage I'm saving throws against

being poison all right I'm gonna let you

make a just make a wisdom Medicine check

for me deceive because technically the

the poison damage would have killed her

outright but I will given the nature of

this spell there may be some bit of life

in her lab yes

[Music]

yeah you don't think this spell can help

her hold on

I turn to Simon the the sergey becomes a

mouse i just put him in a tiny bag and

just like tie him to myself for now okay

okay this is just one problem solved

just temporarily

you got another spell there Evie it's

just like magic there you go all right

breath comes out of her mouth as she is

suddenly alive once more this is the

first time she's actually use this so

she's like cool yeah I'm gonna I'm going

to turn to Simon I'm like do you have

any more of those murder darts I point

to the floor I'm like drop it you may

can intimidate check if you want to that

would be 12 he shrugs his shoulders like

he doesn't know what you're talking

about

just like I know you know what I'm

talking about

wait till we get home I'm also going to

cast as soon as Tatiana's awake death

ward on her okay great so putting up

putting a pin in that one got him

so Strix is currently holding her

husband as a mouse yes close to herself

and she said when Tatyana sort of

regains consciousness for the first word

out of her mouth is Sergei he's right

here

probably squeaking but we need to keep

him

as a mouse for a little while because

his brother is trying to kill you or him

kill him or he kills you it's a long

story but will you help us please you're

insane evylyn tries to hear listen to my

friend Abel and who loves Lysander and

great man he would never do that for all

right you're lying

why do you lie evylyn just like takes

both her hands between her hands and

holds them and she is about for your

soul

it is his lion is so bad for our souls

prays holy with and her in heaven for he

knows the truth that is in our hearts

and I tell you with everything in me

that is true that we are here to save

you and that the entire fate of morovia

rests on our ability to do so I try to

persuade her ok considering she was just

murdered by a robot no show me this

would be fun yeah yeah yeah that's more

like it

that is a 25 she is confused for sure

when she looks into your your fake

little doll eyes and but somehow somehow

she can see in there something which few

people can see a genuineness and an

honesty and she says I believe you thank

you praise good morning Lord stay a

little Lysander buddies now you have to

help us I think that my friend strikes

over there bless her I'm sorry about the

outburst is going to have to impersonate

Sergey so you're gonna have to pretend

that she is him she says can't we just

run away

[Laughter]

I'm just I'm just gonna say that's never

really worked for me so it's probably

not gonna work for you and one way or

another when someone's as evil as stron

is at his core he'll find a way to no

you know he says I she says I don't know

this evil man you described straat

that's not like that he has a he has

committed he has killed many to defend

his family and his lands and his people

but to hurt us to hurt his brother whom

he loves above all I can't imagine it

even kind of gets like persuaded by this

and she's like maybe we could just talk

to him and maybe he wouldn't turn evil

that's a good idea you should try to do

that ya know I mean maybe mostly no he's

he's it's too late he's already I'm sure

he's already made a pact with the dark

powers it's too late yeah I don't think

there's a way that we can convince them

to act otherwise the best that we can do

is try to counteract his his plans so

you can't know anything suspicious is

happening so wait do we have anything

left to show her that shows like struts

do we still have the tome of strawed or

anything you do have the tome of Stroud

and it would not have been written in

this timeline I say don't you have that

book you might be able to show us it'd

be difficult to see but if you feel up

to it you do I have the book yes so you

gonna show her the book yeah this draw

talks about all the horrible things he

did in his life yeah I'll show it to him

be like totally is he writing yeah

Sheila she'll get up off the off the

floor now you can lay the book out on a

table or on a book stand and she can

look at it and as soon as she starts to

go into it you can see her disbelief

changes to fear and horror

it's like comfortingly Pat her on the

shoulder

like rub her back a little bit sorry

mistress is just like bads the face were

used to and she recognizes the hand in

which it's written

she knows that strength draughts

handwriting yeah and she looks at that

the ink and she says is this blood yeah

yeah yeah he does she says no we can't

stay we have to go we have to we have to

end him so that he doesn't hurt all

those people we just set this timeline

right

he is a God in this world you will I

don't wish any harm to befall you that

will almost certainly happen if you

fight him well I've killed him before he

has armies at his command No don't you

think if they see him try to kill you as

he will tomorrow and we save you that

they will understand she says I just

want to be with my beloved Sergei I know

and we'll make that happen

don't you worry we can make it happen

and make sure you're still the rightful

rulers of barodia I think the best way

for that to happen is to simply look an

act neither of us want that we just want

to be quiet life together is just gonna

look here just feel like sorry

you think I'm barmy but to save your

people Simon shoots her again what she

has death Ward on it's fine

yep it's fine so she's she's reduced

once again to she basically falls into

the book stand with another dart in her

neck and is rendered unconscious by the

dark but not killed by it yeah that

brings up my next point

we have

that's a polymorphic Simon no Simon you

dropped those darts just like Carlton

said you drop them right now right now

persuade him we have to destroy him 18

persuasion Simon if you want dinner

tonight we're gonna send you to your

coffin Simon you're gonna go to your

coffin ooh you're gonna think about what

you did

holy even I'm like thrown off by

Hunter we are not destroying him dia can

we at least put like the Simon sort of

takes palton by the hand like like sort

of a protect me gesture right here right

now you've bleed everything else that

we're seeing look at the floor look at

those cars the executioner the otamatone

it's Simon

well now Sergei dies it's this dude yeah

he's gotta go he has to be destroyed

whatever pre could can you have before

well you see you see paltin there's a

third card there Tim third card there's

tempter marionette executioner if the

marionette is the executioner who's the

tempter wait I don't know if we do if

she's the tempter what did she ten

strong Gianna oh is she hearing

this conversation she's unconscious

oh right right call the dart guys a

mouse and we're screwed

does Sergei hear all of this does he

understand as a mouse it's got little

mouse ears but he can't communicate he

can't communicate with us but he can

still understand comment right Oh

evylyn yeah we're getting her up wake

her

slapper I don't care you'll need the

healer healer and cast your truthy spell

I know what's going on here okay even

picks her up before you do that baby

destroy Simon so he doesn't shoot her

again maybe just tape his mouth shut

wait hold on okay shove them in the Box

I'm gonna the box is in with strawed

yeah like Simon Simon can you hold off

on the next Dart

until I say so he's a good boy yeah he's

trying his best I wake her up wait

so you're gonna give her some healing

like night I put her in the chair

give her like a point of healing from

your lay on hands yeah and then I just

like yeah she lumped in a chair and a

stone of truth death Ward looks around

she's sort of lost her sense of bearings

and she says what happened you fainted

you see was overcome it must have been

the book it was a lot to take in

gonna take the book back and stash it

away what exactly do you think of

strawed he's too old for me but I told

him that he wanted me and I said my true

heart belongs to Sergei and he

understood and he has been very

supportive is there anyone that might

think that you're a temptress me

I I don't know I don't know anyone who

might think that about me

I just maybe think I might that way

maybe straud maybe he might think you're

a temptress and make up murder bot to

stab you

he didn't make that I don't think I'll

hire someone you know she said make it

know where did it come from

do you think there's anyone else around

that might be just well described as a

temptress well there's the Duchess

Dorothy atlas Nia she tried to seduce

strut but he would not have any of her

do you think she might try to seduce

anyone else I don't know no it's the

Duchess what's the Duchess I don't know

but listen to Tatiana she wants tried

sure I want to talk to you Anna

Tatiana Australian wants no one else

until she wants Duchess

can we roll the Duchess also mentioned

to UDF and Strix are sorry - you evil

inand palton down outside the chapel

that when she looked at you evylyn and

asked you if you were an original von

weird she said she had one of her own

yeah okay so can I roll an insight check

to get some clarity about what I

understand about this situation sure

it's very poor it is a 9 mm murder

bought bad and that's where I'll stop

for tonight I've been saying that for

months murder pop back but he has

potential he's trying

there's a big boy in their box

more to burrow via next week and we'll

pick up the game then

want to share about where they're going
