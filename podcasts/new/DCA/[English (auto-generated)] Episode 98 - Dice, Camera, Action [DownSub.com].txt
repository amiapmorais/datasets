hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action a D&D show super spectacular

happy fun 90-minute hour so previously

in dice camera action the heroes arrived

in water deep and over the course of a

day or two crossed paths with a number

of representatives of the zenith Art

Guild and discovered that some of them

had intellect devours brain like

creatures with legs hiding out in their

skulls basically using them as meat

puppets

evylyn at chair pond evil in one over a

dwarf with a crossbow mounted to his arm

who is actually an enforcer in the Santa

thar guild and brought him over to the

side of the light and caused him to

forsake his previous allegiance and

nasca her gray the dwarf revealed that

these intellect of ours were basically

being put into the heads of people by a

mind flayer in league with the zanaffar

meanwhile father son bright of the

spires of the morning the temple of

Lathon durr in Waterdeep had an

encounter with magnus Burnside's at the

end of which there's some there was some

exchange of currency magnus stole a holy

symbol from the dead father what are you

gonna do yeah and also and also

name-dropped evylyn which prompted

father sunbright to ask magnus if he

would be so kind as to let evil and know

that it's it's time for her to come home

he wants he wants to find out what she's

been up to and what she might have had

to do with the end of the death curse

when magnus rejoined the waffle crew at

the yawning portal tavern deaath was

just coming off of a brutal encounter

with seven representatives of seven

dwarven clans of the north who accused

d/f of basically genocide

of murdering a bunch of innocent dwarves

and then abandoning them to their fate

and the dwarves demanded recompense in

the form of gold dwarven gold that had

been taken from dwarven minds and minted

into water Davian coins

d/f was pretty distraught but Magnus was

able to provide some much-needed comfort

whereupon DF broke down before he was

engulfed in this swarm of rats but like

in a good way exactly in form of hugging

rats there's a comforting swarm of rats

okay

a warm swarm Strix strips Strix in her

rap swarm form alright I'm swapping

apart hashtag everybody roll initiative

[Applause]

[Laughter]

Travis I too got NAT 2000 Wow so what

does that mean total if I'm 25 okay so

50 years enemy mine 20 to 25 for DF 22

for magnus paltin 15 for evylyn 15 for

even dirty 6 I'm sorry what I thought

you said 36 no dirty 36 a man you earned

that so yeah oh yeah Strix 5 okay

alright you are all inside a vaulted

sewer chamber 20 feet high about 40 feet

across with three different tunnels

leading into it and also water and filth

kind of dribbling down the walls through

pipes in the ceiling it stinks down here

it smells like troglodyte poo and

there's some light bleeding through what

appears to be a great high up

in the middle of the ceiling and it

looks like the light of day coming

pouring down into the sewers you have

been led here by Nausicaa or gray who

knows the path to where the mind flare

has been hiding out and abducting people

you are presently engaged in battle with

said mind flare who stands in the middle

of the room in sludge wearing a leather

gas mask over its face that has its

tentacles coming out through it and

goggles over its Oppel essent eyes and

behind are next to it you can see two

trolls wearing balls and chains their

feet shackled together by short lengths

of chain so they can't really run too

fast though they can still move around

and floating all around you are spores

not to mention what appeared to be or

what appeared to be three B holders

however they are all sort of rotted and

decayed some of their eye stalks have

fallen away and their central eyes are

either just blind or gaping holes where

the ice where the orbits used to be

drool just sort of pouring out through

their undead mouths they are surrounded

by what appeared to be beholder like

balloons smaller than the B holders

maybe about three feet across but they

kind of look like weird spherical orbs

with false eyes and little stubby eye

stocks coming off of them one of them

has already exploded in the room filling

it with spores and I would like to know

what DF does next

first thing that happens is throughout

the entire chamber you hear a record

scratch and indeed turns to the camera

says yep that's me as like as the scenes

froze didn t hear dad's voiceover you

hear paltin be like do the you

do

[Laughter]

what what Dwight what I why what what so

the first thing you guys need to know is

that there are some corpses lying on the

floor around you what appear to be dead

dung sweepers you can see a dead undead

beholder and other just sort of globs of

rotting flesh all about the room you can

also see what appeared to be a couple

dead intellect of our as their little

tiny clawed leg sticking up in the air I

would like you all to decide before you

act the f you have lost a total of 100

hit points divide those up any way you

want

between just a clarifier we've had a

rest since the day before right that's

correct yeah so your your fresh - 100

hit points which which you have lost

which you have lost over the course of

making it here basically I'm I'm happy

to take 30 of them okay I'll take 30 as

well by uncanny dodge it down to 15

no-nos Joe and Oscar will take ten so

that's 40 and 30 is sorry I can take ten

as well okay so that's with Travis strix

and Nausicaa that's 50 there's 50 more

I'll be 15 okay I take like 20 okay so

that leaves you with 15 in it I mean

yeah it might be better if you have a

lot right now yeah you need to have a

lot you'd let me take more I have a

bunch of hit points let me take like 20

yeah

also Magnus can't heal magnets can only

do like one thing like 15 away from my

total is like nothing right that's fine

yeah I'm just saying you might want to

give me some more well you've got two

fresh trolls three undead beholders a

bunch of guests bores I don't know

you've never even fought one beholder

this is

uh yeah just well I'll take 20 I'll take

20 I'm taking 20 it's done so 20 off of

paltin 20 off of Strix 15 off of DF 15

off of evylyn 10 off of nazca and a

shit-ton off of magnus DF all right so

where was the mine flare placed in the

room sort of a sort of in the centre

with you guys and the two trolls the bee

holders are kind of floating around the

edges of the rooms along with their gas

pores okay and you also had mentioned

the fact the sewer pipes pouring water

into the room yeah there's sludge kind

of their high sewer pipes covered with

sort of moss and mildew and they're just

sort of seeping out water down the walls

into basically troughs on the floor okay

that's not like I've trying to flooding

or anything like no it's just sort of a

continuous filtered stream okay cool

well this will be this is sort of a

junction chamber it used to be sort of

cordoned off with iron grates and things

but those grates were torn off their

hinges are removed long ago all right so

that mine fires gonna die so all right

so dethaw already having out gutter

obviously into this fight with his

offhand he actually unsheathed the

dagger from the front of his belt okay

and then makes a motion to throw the

dagger at the mine flare but rather than

actually throwing it it's just

misdirection because as soon as that

hand comes down he misty steps behind it

and then tries to back stab it with

gutter okay so yep that's all I got

you take the mind flayer by surprise as

you appear behind it with your dagger in

hand yay and gutter drawn as well 25

that hits good you pierce through its

leather armor

started off right then that's with

several D sixes there's a lot of those

six 11:15

21:36 total points of damage okay

it does not like that I don't like that

it had time to think of it didn't liked

it or not all right we get the potion

Strix mentioned earlier the what brain

stuff Magnus what do you do um with DF

behind you I have advantage so you do

have advantage on the mind flayer you

also see the two trolls that are kind of

guarding the mind flayer are turning

their hungry eyes upon DF so I would

have to probably get past the trolls to

get to the mind flayer

no you could you could storm right up to

the mind flayer no problem there I would

like to do that okay then I you know go

ahead I was gonna say that will provoke

opportunity attacks from the trolls cuz

you're they have reach

okay well then instead of that you said

there's a great up above I'm gonna use

the grappling hook to jump up controls

okay just make an athletics strength a

strength athletics track not uh sixteen

that succeeds okay and then I'm going to

attack the mind flayer six times with

the flaming raging poison exhort of doom

excellent that's a 22 yeah okay now lots

of math okay it's a hits that's 28

Oh points of damage and then 17 that is

a Miss that seems to bounce off of what

is like sort of like a psionic shield is

my superiority dice for

or what is it to use it on precision

attack roll an extra dice okay that's it

[Music]

so actually 25 you pierce its psychic

shield so that's 25 points of damage

okay and then mm 13 that's not gonna do

it but I'm gonna do precision attack

again okay and so that would be 18 that

is a hit that does 27 points of damage

okay and then 26 oh yes and then that's

30 points of damage and then 17 which I

know is a Miss or there's another

precision attack 304 that I can do and

that's a 20 okay that's a hit even has a

similar moment to palton earlier where

like you just you can't just take that's

27 very good and then nice yep and then

oh that's only 25 points of damage

oh my oh okay and then an 18 that's a

hit and that's 32 points of damage okay

so thank God so I helped yeah so you did

help you're kind of I guess hanging from

the rope is that right as your maker I I

imagine kind of a zip down okay you know

so when you kind of land next to him you

just go full Cuisinart and this whirling

blade it just sort of slices and dices

this mind flayer until it's into tiny

little pieces and its head just sort of

floats in the air for a second staring

off into oblivion and then falls upon

the pile of severed flesh that way we're

fighting all this because he's here

and yeah it's not alright

the mind flayer would normally go but it

is

now kaput the trolls

it's thralls will turn to Magnus and

angrily try to tear him to pieces yeah

that is there yeah it's kind of helping

like you would give her the mind control

or somehow this is fine what is the AC

of one Magnus Burnside's

with the shield out 20 okay so one of

the trolls rakes you with its claws and

also hits you with its bite and it does

it does a total of 18 points of damage

to you Magnus okay and then the second

one is only going to hit you with one

claw and it does 11 points

so a total of 29 points of damage from

the trolls okay and they just are

screaming insanities at you and it is

evil UNS turn evil UNS like looking at

her own flaming sword kind of having one

of those moments of like the Charlie

Brown like dude but but she jumps in it

tries to help with the trolls that seems

to be what's threatening Magnus the most

right now right yes so yeah she'll jump

in with the heart of Spinelli okay and

rolls a nineteen that is a hit so she

does 18 damaged all right

oh man she's gonna take one more swing

same dude okay and that's gonna be a 15

and your sword is on fire right now

right mm-hmm yes

part of that is fire damage I don't ya

know it's great when you hit it with

fire you can see that the wounds that

you leave in its flesh you you've known

trolls to regenerate before this one

cannot reach

the fiery damage burn with the fiery

power of the morning Lord all right and

enjoy your second damage mm-hmm is it is

it undead funny the troll is alive oh it

takes 20 more okay

the troll is sliced by the fire you see

fear reflected in its black eyes as the

flames dig deep into its warty flesh one

does one attack and then two and then

she like looks like she wishes she could

do another one and she's like I figure

did a great job

alright paltin you see you see Magnus

evylyn engaged in combat and and deaath

engaged in combat with the two ball and

chained trolls and then you see these

three undead be holders floating about

20 feet above watching all of this

unfold and these beholders are he said

they're 20 feet up yep and each of them

is surrounded by three floaty balloon

like gas pores is there uh is there

anything that's maybe roughly I don't

know five feet tall that I could get on

top of there's a particular range I

would like to meet

yeah so you can essentially climb up on

two waffles your friendly neighborhood

al bear would that count as my action

that's that's part of your movement so

you still have an action of you okay

cool I'm gonna just like walk up to

walls be like sorry excuse me

I like give waffles like a little pet

when I like yeah okay good very good

and then from up there I want a thunder

wave those beholders okay if I may well

alright

you could get since they're all sort of

spread out in different parts of the

room you could get one beholder and it's

three gasp or bye

I'll take it all right so I'm up here

Griffey and they have to make a saving

throw mmm okay they that I'm not gonna

roll for the gas pours but the beholder

zombie failed cool so that's two things

that should never be together filter and

zombie so we got great I love that

there's still people in the chat talking

about how much damage I did

I am also sorry I know that is 23 all

right so a ripple of thunderous energy

washes over the beholder

it blows up all three of the gas pours

around it and their spores just begin to

sort of settle and pervade around the

room we the zombie is still alive but

sort of blasted backwards it kind of

bounces off the back wall with a

squishing noise and and leaves bits of

itself kind of stuck on the jagged walls

it's actually sort of impaled on a

sticking out pipe for a second that's

gotta peel itself off and you just hear

this sort of sucking sound as it comes

off mmm tasty and then it sort of rolls

back around to face you paltin and just

sort of glares at you with its four

remaining eye stalks it looks at me I'm

just like behold these nuts good

question oh my god okay I would I guess

I will the mine player is dead and the

trolls are yes

because I could burn the trolls but by

doing a fireball I can pretty much

encompass everyone in this room yeah so

um let's burn the crap out of everyone

so fireball goes Ground Zero and I would

like to do a fifth level so I'd like to

make it and how many how many creatures

can you sculpt it around I'm gonna

exclude the party and Magnus obviously

and waffles okay you can get everybody

yeah I think that should be everyone oh

and uh our who's with us

what's an Oscar Oscar Oscar and nasca

okay and I don't think Simon is there

right

Simon is that's a good question I'll

leave that up to palton to decide

whether he left Simon back at the inn or

brought him here waffles is here right

yes yeah but waffles is a killing

machine

I guess Simon is literally killing me

I'll say if we if we brought waffles I

woulda brought okay great okay and he is

all sings yeah he is also excluded then

he's just sort of riding on waffles neck

okay good boy all right

so flames fill the room people in the

city above or aghast as some flames

shoot up through the grate into the

street above meat that's only 35 damage

only 35 damage you're saying DC 16

so first behold first roll roll very

well second troll failed first beholder

zombie pay old second beholder zombie

succeeded so takes half also I'm really

happy to be casting this cuz I can't do

it out in the streets and a soul just

like way and the third succeeded takes

half all of the gas pores are blown to

bits and your flame also incinerates a

lot of their spores that are kind of

over you I'm real happy about being

useful it's also gonna be like it also

kind of burns away some of the stems

that pervades the room I probably don't

notice that probably not and so when the

fire subsides the trolls and the

beholder zombies are the only creatures

left in the room

Nazca will fire off his crossbow at one

of the trolls and he will hit it I

really love the image of like us all

doing these multiple attacks and thunder

wave and fireball then Nasus like yeah

his shot goes clean through the ears of

one of the trolls and it falls back dead

on the ground

it is the one that you were in melee

with yes I turned to Nazca and I give

him a little nod like and then he just

sort of gestures for you to look back at

the troll and when you do you see one of

those intellect of ours phase out of its

head onto the ground just starts

scuttling around was it like attached to

its head it was in it was where its

brain used to be so was in its cranium

and now has phased out good in search of

a new host let's see so we're down to

one troll and the beholder zombies go

alright one of the beholder zombies the

one that paltin attacked will target it

with an array paltin I need you to make

a dexterity saving through

how close are you to evylyn question of

the day how close something that

probably not within 10 feet at this

point yeah that's cool

all right buddy okay so how okay okay

Paul Tennyson unless you know a for a

green ray launches from one of the I

stocks of this undead beholder strikes

paltin in the chest and paltin takes 45

force damage that's not nothing good

neuron on the way back up okay how much

45 okay just like all right guys

gonna take a little snooze II you have

any hit points left huh Jim I am

unconscious so you're 45 like you're at

zero well I had a because they took that

20 before we got in here I told you not

how close is Haltom to me well hang on

so paltin are you at zero currently yeah

okay if the damage reduces the creature

to zero hit points it is reduced to a

pile of fine gray dust I was how close

is paltin to me he's about 20 feet away

hmm disintegration right that's fine we

have a scroll resurrection it's fine

okay so paltin is struck by this ray and

then you just see this explosion of dust

and he's scream he's gone blood-curdling

scream okay a couple a couple kids up in

the streets above here scream emanate

from the great that this flame just shot

out of and began to sort of peer down

into the darkness

all right Paul ting is Paul tunes gear

by graded so just sort of all like War

of the Worlds style kind of Falls and

cascades around him

gherkins I don't feel so good all right

the second one to beholder Holly you

know what okay the so can you say dust

dust dot your turn to dust for Paul

integration spell it makes your portrait

go great Mother's Gabe if only you were

closer to me all right the second

beholder will fire a black crackling ray

at Evelyn who has to make a constitution

saving through 22 okay you succeed and

take half damage from the beam and take

18 necrotic damage barely a scratch and

then strix the third one third beholder

is gonna fire a meaning at you you see a

pink ray launched itself at you you have

to make a constitution saving through

okay okay that's a sixteen you are

successful and suffer no ill effect oh

okay it wasn't gonna dominate me was it

hmm you're not sure all right

the B holders are all done at this point

which brings us to who are they waffles

grain waffles cease this sort of shower

of fine dust all around it and then goes

barreling at with Simon writing on her

back at the sole remaining troll and

just sort of locked rears up and

launches herself

at it tearing into it with her bite and

missing with her claws but the bite does

a fair amount of damage the troll is

still alive after getting chewed out by

the Al bear and it is d at Stern

okay so one troll remains in three

beholders that's correct and the brain

with legs and the brain with legs that

just came out of the dead like the legs

with brain however you want to look at

it okay

the death will just swiftly step towards

that intellect of our and try to quick

finish it before it does the other awful

 that's probably wise thank you

go ahead appreciate the reassurance

right now yeah 25 you hit it good no

sneak attack or anything is you you have

advantage because evylyn is close to it

Oh sick well then just to make sure okay

all right Larry why the ones why so many

ones hmm because Jared this is dice

camera action were you mistaken for

having fun

23 no yeah you kill it good all

right it's it's 21 hit points can't hold

up against your raffle strike yay I

would like to use my cunning action to -

to evil app okay I'm just gonna stay

right near that aura okay I think I'm

buying it too right yes okay yeah the

only one who sort of ran off was paltin

cuz he ran up to waffles and got on

board yeah Maggie that's really really

really really quick yeah between just

like before next turn

just another record scratch another

freeze-frame freestream imagine if you

will paltin walking out he's clearly not

there just like in front of the screen

yeah and you just turned straight

forward and goes what the Perkins

come on

[Laughter]

carry on

box off-screen like that like the

Emperor's New Groove scene yeah hi ok

yeah ok

so left are the 3 B holders 3d hole

doors wrong and one troll ok I'm going

to first scoot closer to everybody else

so we're all back together y'all and

then I'm going to switch to the chance

Lance and throw that at one of the B

holders okay there's one beholder that

why'd he hit with the Thunder way okay

that one's the worst off yeah uh 23 that

is it 9 points of damage

not that much okay it's certain pails in

its soft flesh and I call it back and

throw it again well that is the one but

luckily I have gamblers luck on my tooth

necklace that lets me reroll ones on a

tag very good okay that's the one again

[Laughter]

I'm sorry what was the second row 27

okay that's a hit and then that's 9

points of damage again

alright okay that beholder is still

alive I'm gonna throw one more time my

third attack yep 23 hit man 6 points are

damaged okay it yet lives little

floating sacks a hit points that's what

I got okay great

so that is Magnus and it is the trolls

turn no yes the trolls turn it is pretty

single-mindedly going to all it's got so

many choices what's it gonna go after

it's gonna go after evil in however it

didn't roll higher than a 6 on its d20

roll so evylyn you were able to easily

deflect this trolls raking claw

and it's biting teeth I SWAT it like

it's like a fly yep

and then we come to your turn evylyn

even Supremes runs over to the pile of

dust that will provoke from our troll if

you care she takes it okay

I think they rolled a four so cool she's

trying to gather the dust into a pile

okay muttering bringing drinks I told

him to stay close

I told him to stay close to me I told

him and she just that tall she does okay

uh yeah he is he's very very fine powder

it's not even like ash which is sort of

flaky it's just sort of like very

granular I imagine it's probably all

over her - it's like iron yeah

everyone's asking if he still has the

snake person gift can he still that's

still count the what oh well you can't

die or is that still is that not active

anymore after

you so evil in you notice that it this

dust even smells like pollen sell this

nursing gift only lasts like 30 minutes

or something like that yeah that's good

like that death ward yeah I think it was

30 days but yeah yeah it's gone yeah

okay so that's Evelyn's turn which will

bring us to oh and then Strix oh darn

gosh to skip over him dusty McDuck face

yeah okay I noticed that yeah you see me

weeping over take note tired of that

happening um look over I can't deal with

that emotional trauma who is left for

the beholders over there who is left for

the Bell

and her two boulders left there are

three be holders left are three boulders

list Oh quite badly hurt gosh oh oh dear

there's also a troll really really close

to you fighting waffles and evil and

we're not evil in anymore um okay

are the be holders clustered together no

okay

no I can't do that okay well then I am

just going to try and twin spell

polymorph two of the beholders okay what

are you trying to turn them into um

since we're gonna Stuart I mean since

we're gonna see where I'll try rats okay

okay the very very wounded one turns

into a rat No thank God then falls takes

damage and turns back into a beholder

but when it hits the ground and go splat

like a rat and turns back into a

beholder it's now kind of on the ground

lying on its side rather confused

kicking the other one really scrapes are

you kidding me

the the other one resists roll roll

damage to d6 for the falling damage the

rat the rat rule eight okay we'll take

good 77 points the damages okay so that

beholder on the ground is still alive

albeit a little bit perplexed quickened

spell to give myself a bonus action sure

again so I'm then I'm going to use my

sorcery points to quick and spell

another fireball more waves of fire fill

the room the kids up topper sort of

blown back as flames shoot up through

the grate I will make saving throws for

the troll and they're zombies okay

that one was 32 even it was a normal one

there 32 yeah okay the beholder on the

ground is incinerated you blow it to

pieces as flames course through its body

really nothing's left but ashes and bits

of decayed burnt flesh the two floating

be holders are still alive

one of them took more damage than the

other basically caught the full brunt of

the fireball the other one only caught

part of it the troll took all of that

damage and is incinerated as well

collapsing into a pile upon at which

point to the intellect of our in its

skull phases out untouched by the flames

so there there are to be holders and an

intellect of our left and it is waffles

turn waffles can only see the inflected

can only attack the intellect of our so

he's it's she's gonna go after that and

she just gobbles it up good little legs

sticking out from under her beak and

then they're gone mmm Britney not no

more intellect of ours there are two

floaty B holders both burned by scorched

by flames you can see waffles look

confused because she doesn't know what

else to attack at this point I guess

she's done Simon will just hang out on

waffles back and nasca will attempt to

shoot one of the beholder zombies

succeeding and it takes 19 points of

damage and is still alive the B holders

go evylyn is off with Paul toons remains

the rest of you are clustered around

Magnus beholder number one is going to

target evylyn with a green

disintegration ray evil and make a

dexterity saving throw a ender have a

nice - oh no oh come on

come on 600 all right I'm gonna roll the

demon

but a lot of hit points don't do this

even's literally like back to the

beholder like I told him just to know

what this can't I can't but my I told

him to stay close

evylyn you take 44 points of damage okay

do you have any hip pointing would I

yeah I still 44 you said yeah yeah I'm

still okay okay she like that happens

and she just like her eyes blazed and

she kind of turns around and she's like

okay Oh Alton's like watching from a

theater just like alright Magnus you are

targeted by the second beholder a pink

ray lenses for that you you have to make

a constitution saving through okay

well that's bad but good news I'm gonna

use indomitable okay cuz otherwise would

have been a seven okay oh that's better

19 okay you resist the effect and

nothing happens yeah alright we are back

at the top with DF Woodrow there too

bit damaged B holders floating above

we're all floaty and stuff they are

floaty and stuff I can't reach that 20

feet up yeah I do

yes you can do it I believe in you you

have never seen me throw a dagger no it

doesn't refers time I used it I don't

tell it

yeah diesel just take his magic dagger

just try to throw it at uh whichever one

shot evil in just now I don't get that

one alright go ahead and make your

attack complete with that

[Laughter]

yeah well 12 that does not hit that was

after a +9 okay oh Jesus dagger comes

back your hand

yup okay okay uh let's see

Magnus you see the dagger hit nothing

return to his hand you tried and I'm

proud of you it's okay we'll talk about

it later there's a lot to unpack so the

first thing Magnus is gonna do is fish

the holy symbol out of his pocket that

he stole from whatever father white

belly or whatever son right yeah and say

Eva like catch and I throw it to evil

evil and just make a dexterity check to

catch it no it's not a hard 119 you're

good

it's not anything I have no idea what

that is you see it is a bejeweled holy

symbol I make a like a wisdom insight

check these new dice are fire um 20 you

sense that there is some magic embedded

in this thing but more than that you

think you recognize this symbol you have

seen it worn on an individual before

somebody who haven't seen in years back

when you briefly stayed in dagger furred

you sort of hung out at the local temple

there and be priests there one father

Luke son bright Sun bright right wore

this prominently while he was basically

giving sermons and doing does that mean

I know what kind of magical properties

it has you know this gives evil and

pause and interesting enough I actually

have this like physical symbol it's at

my office but as Schultz on twitter sent

it to me I have this crazy

but you also with your insight you also

realize that some the sunlight streaming

through the great overhead is sort of

falling upon you and the dust pile that

used to be paltin and you can see the

beholder is all eyes staring at you

right now

you think this symbol is so bright you

could reflect that light and possibly my

turn blind it well that was so Magnus

just chucked you that thing so it is in

fact your turn I like ah try to reflect

light with it I guess there's just yeah

so you hold it in the Sun beam and you

kind of shine it flash it across the

beholder Zizek a lot of Lysander compels

you and it has to make a constitution

say McGrew and it rolled a five so you

see all to be holders eyes flick and

close and sort of turn away and the

beholder just sort of bump into a wall

as it tries to get away from the light

ah

is that my action using an object or

could I also attack you can use an

object basically as a free action on

return so sick so I can also attack yeah

okay so that one is bumping up against

the wall where's the other one the other

one is on the far side of the vaulted

chamber closer to your friends than you

the one that I'm facing is the one that

came at me right that's right and it is

currently it is currently blinded so you

would have advantage on attack rolls

against it yeah it's getting the heart

of Spinelli right in its bulbous body

mm-hmm that's uh 22 all right so you've

launched yourself at it and embed your

flaming sword into its bulbous body roll

damage 23 okay it's still alive and she

just she's just like cuz it's like face

against the wall and she's brutal like

like Princess Bride Rous ha ha just over

and over again pulling it out and

sticking it back in this is an at 20 Oh

scary stuff okay so we're all your

damage twice and then add your bonuses

twelve

tene 18-plus okay

[Music]

and the modifier only once or twice once

35 okay you kill it with fire and steel

and be blind to beholder falls dead and

goes splash down onto the floor that was

awesome

he was just standing there evylyn

standing there with like dust up to her

elbows with a flaming sword in her hand

like staring down at this mush and just

going like you've never seen her so

angry

alright then it is Strix is turn hi hi

welcome welcome

misterx is a fireball Factory I um so

upset okay so our both will be holders

blind no just the one caught was blinded

by the flashing light of the holy symbol

great okay so that one is blind so it

can't I

it can't cast it's it's dings okay was

dead okay good evil there's only one

left there's one left it was it's been

burned by your previous fireball okay

okay um is there a way that I could cast

darkness on its head sure you could it's

it's a darkness is basically a 20-foot

radius right but it's above us though so

it is okay

it would also blot out your friends view

of it that's right yeah I don't really

want to do that oh okay you know what

evil looks real mad so I'm actually

going to quick and spell it's making a

bonus action haste okay on Evelyn all

right evylyn you are

tasted and that means you're cool you

have a bunch of really cool bonuses and

then I'm going to try and is it less

than half its hit points it's got more

than half its hit points

it's got more than half at these points

okay then I'm just gonna have to do

another fireball alright people up in

the city are very confused by what's

happening down here oh okay so that's

just the normal 8:28 okay it takes half

of that as it slightly singed and then

Nazca will take a shot at it with his

crossbow he will hit it he'll do 19 more

points of damage to it it is now has

fewer than half its hit points left

clearly it's on pretty bad shape pieces

of it are sloughing off and then it is

going to fire a disintegration ray at

you Strix like make it a dexterity

saving throw cool cool cool cool cool

cool

great cool oh yeah um okay that's 17 you

are successful haha hard can't take this

you dodged out of the way look at your

paper fat you dodged the beam and don't

get the plus and huh you at that point

the beholder just sort of yawns yes and

you see a tiny little beholder fly out

of its mouth and immediately sort of

disappear into the nearest pipe

it's like the little tiny beholder that

you saw at the docks who was alongside

the tiefling child I hate this yeah this

baseball-sized beholder comes out of its

mouth and that disappears into a pipe

how oh is it like a tiny pipe it it's a

creature could fit down this pipe or

squeeze down this pipe if were you know

agile DF could fit cuz he's not

particularly heavily armored or anything

evil and could fit cuz she's kind of

small but Strix could fit as a swarm of

rats no problem I don't know what Magnus

has got in his bag of tricks you might

you might just try that you know cramp

his way down yeah it's almost certainly

separately boy it's yeah it's almost

something you'd have to crawl at least

it would be like Bruce Willis in die

hard crawling through the vents

basically come to water debase down

right okay so you all see this little

baby behold our fly out of the undead

B holders mouth and then disappear into

a pipe and that's it for it strong and

then D F what do you do okay chat goes

paltin could fit he's fallen watching

also sees had in Chinese like that was

good it's too fast

it's too fast for us to be making jokes

so yeah this pipe that this small older

went into yeah how it was that like high

upper it's about it's about 20 feet up

but there are all kinds of little

protrusions out of the walls and things

and bits of iron sticking out and stuff

playing on so it's not a it would not be

arduous to get up there all right I'm

like hop off around some pipes and

things and yeah way up there yeah

there's actually a piece of what looked

like like an iron bridge that may have

crossed that a higher threshold one

point this sort of fell and kind of

banged up against the wall and sort of

rusted there you can kind of clamour up

that and then leap over onto yeah it's

it's very spirited and then see if I can

see it down inside this pipe at all okay

yeah when you can see that the pipe is

wonderfully greased it's got all sorts

of mildew and fill

encrusted upon it so you think you can

slip in there pretty good it's kind of

its kind of stinky because it's it's

stuff spilling out basically from sewers

of the city but can I can I see the

little guy in there you're a human

let's see your your range of vision

isn't great so now you'd have to look it

up to like light something yeah I don't

think I can chase it yeah actually reach

it like look like I did I would be on

hands and knees and crawling pretty much

right oh yes yeah you'll be able to

navigate it pretty well but yeah but I

feel it just helps speed me fine I from

then where I am to just notice he's gone

I'll turn back to the reporter and just

the dead rat okay mom

hanging out up here all right it looks

real cool yeah so cool that by rolling

terrible 22 that's it good 9 th9 damage

alright it is still alive but in bad

shape

good so you're hanging up here with it

Magnus you see DF hanging off the wall

stabbing this thing yes so one of my

attacks I am going to look at

evylyn and say hate it again and use a

commanding strike or commander's strike

and give her a +6 bonus hello to her

attack no to damage oh okay great so

even you got +6 on damage on her next

attack is that right well so no she

attacks right now oh oh right now you're

giving her your action attack oh I still

get two more attacks guys my first

attack even gets to take it with

classics damage but she also gave about

crazy haste advantage and stuff on her

swing too or Paulie what are all the

benefits of the haste

oh here let me check real quick look I

found the holy symbol while she's

looking

so cool actually long as shulte on

twitter it's actually bejeweled symbol

of what they are made of brass it's

amazing and you can just keep it around

- I don't know bless things okay so you

get a +2 you bonus - a C and you have

advantage on dexterity saving throws and

you gain an additional action on each of

your turns what and so that action can

be used only to take the attack action -

disengage hide or use an object that'll

be on your turn

yeah that's all in your turn so plus you

bonus a you see advantage on dexterity

saving throws and you get a bonus at you

get another action not a bonus action

but an actual action because this isn't

a real turn this is a commander's

correct yeah yeah but your real turn

you'll get another action okay and

really quick can I just point out when

anyone else dies it's so sad and

traumatizing it's cetera et cetera

paltin gets disintegrated and the chat

is just fire Joe the chat okay so first

okay the two shout outs I want to I just

want say Paul wants to say real quick

our new name Ashton the follow-up for

the follow-up tour is the drunk off my

ass how you'd want to go out it kind of

is I appreciate it

it is the most appropriate funeral oh it

hurts

as Magnus's words Marshall you into

action

evylyn MA sending spell taps into your

mind and says evil and marth aim if this

is you this is Luke sunbright at the

spires of the morning come visit let's

catch up I have something to show you

you up leave LA read bloom on read like

evil ones looking at the thing and she

here's this this vo she's looking at the

symbol she hears this and she looks at

the dust on the ground and she looks up

and she's like yeah she just like

declines that call okay ignites the

flaming sword all right make your attack

uh sixteen that is a hit for fifteen

damage is that wait the six oh no not

with that with the six with the six you

kill it you slash clean through it and

it falls away evil in as it goes down in

flames and falls away you see DF

standing before you hanging off the wall

Hey

okay all of your enemies are dead we

were out of initiative the sounding

spell that she just kind of like put on

hold was it something that she would

like respond to or was it just yeah she

can respond with up to twenty-five words

if she so chooses so all the baddies die

palton still watching he's just like

alright it's over it's gonna be a dream

sequence watch watch just like watch

tapping whoever's next to him in the

theater it's like it's not real watch

its Falcon weird this deters sold-out

Asher is sitting right next to just run

a little bits of popcorn at Polly's okay

a couple rows back he's like trying to

sneak a hand onto his arena's bringing

some pop crap

Esmerelda's somewhere okay so people

you've killed cuz I'm getting loved and

killed an actual child also ride right

yeah yeah the little girl that you

killed

look in charge yes it's like that scene

in American Werewolf in London where all

the dead people that you mauled yeah

corner in the theater and tell you to

kill yourself

alright no jokes this isn't funny you

guys okay so you're all this immediately

try and sweep up those ashes into a safe

place oh you gotta get them all yeah

yeah there was mention of a scroll

someone said something about a scroll is

that is that something yeah I have a

scroll of resurrection but I don't know

if that's the kind of resurrection that

we we need for this I know magic but I

don't know if it's that good of magic

because he is disintegrated like oh my

gosh is poor dead that's okay we've all

been so dead not white nos no sort of

stands over strictest as you're

collecting everything he says so you

have an opening now then I actually then

Nausicaa Tosca sort of comes over sees

evil and and says hey I actually could

have a connection that might be able to

help if you got the router extra spell I

I kind of have an in with the Raven

Queen well yeah I know a couple of

people that work for her oh I mean she's

really sad yeah I mean like we met her

we met her a person

yeah the Raven Queen has a specific

connection to paltin right so so would

see me yeah yeah yes very much there she

has a very least an interest in paltin

beyond the normal I know a couple like I

know a couple like Reapers um I could

probably get a message to her and see if

that's something that she could maybe

help us out with usually ask Lysander

[Laughter]

like one like it ones like oh oh yeah

press is that like unhold button Hey so

nice to hear from you totally would love

to catch up see you real soon hope you

don't mind me asking for a little

okay bye let's go to the spires were you

talking to that cookie dear flora

approach

evylyn at this point and kinda like

hands on the shoulder and I just kind of

face her like just right like just I to

eyes like people in are you okay look at

me right here

evylyn it will be okay stay with me stay

cool how could it possibly be okay okay

look I have another thing I can maybe

help out with it's not as interesting

hold on one second and Magnus pulls out

his pocket workshop which is the pocket

dimension he has that's his woodshop he

ducks into it real quick and comes back

with a bag of 2,000 golds and hands it

to evil and it's like this is probably

gonna this is like grease and palms if

you want to like do that usually there's

like some kind of like donation process

the church right you pay for

resurrection or whatever so this should

help

how much more gold do you have in there

what I'm doing pretty good

I mean no listen we just met 36 hours do

you have unlimited cookies in there - no

well drinks were kind of busy right now

can we not think about cookies I'm sorry

evylyn you focus we know what we need to

do we have to go do it you keep your

mind on that until the ashes yeah yeah

you've collected you it all

though all the ashes that you could find

yeah I'm actually licking my finger and

like touching around like I do little

thing if we go to the spires I do think

that they probably have the power to

bring him back right

in some way or another you think it's

it's within the power of the temple to

raise the dead now they need a body

typically I know sander was going to

help me it has got to be now do I know

if the scroll that I have is true

resurrection or just resurrection I feel

like it was true resurrection it came

from the hells and was big so I'm

guessing it might be true resurrection

yeah that's true resurrection good I'm

just like don't worry I got this and I

like pulling it to my room but you you

know you know that a spell that high

level even cast on a scroll if you're

not high enough to actually be able to

cast the spell there's a chance the

spell could fail right well we'll have

to Strix will hold it up and say

wherever she gets it from inside of her

person and say this could bring you back

I can't cast it though I don't know

enough magic especially like holy magic

to do this well so we need to go to the

temple unfortunately even's kind of just

like staring at the holy symbol sadly

and she's like this is all my fault

nope it's gone to the spires no we can't

go here madness has gone bad do what you

did to death to evil and I can't deal

with this you let another that right now

never talk please Nazca will say it's

it's not your fault

what naka yeah I was gonna say I was

like yeah fine that guy I believe I

believe in the light of Lysander yeah

sander is showing me where I should have

been all along let's go we need to go to

the spires right now all right you leave

the sewers by the same route that Nazca

brought you here minus one member when

you come back up you collect up all

fountains things obviously right yes

you've got all of his belongings left

nothing behind except corpses of your

slain foes you follow no leave only

footprints what did we need from the

mind flayer we need to take it so you

didn't need anything you were just

killing him off so that he couldn't

continue to lead into elective hours and

stick them in the heads of people so

you've done it stopping the intellect

devourer

do you have anything that we could sell

on him he I don't know he his chopped up

remains are just sort of lying in a pile

in the middle of the room Moss is his

gas-mask is designed to fit his head so

that won't really serve you well is a

fun memento yeah was there stuff in his

lair

so this he was using this place to

basically capture people and implant

them in you don't really think it's his

lair lair as in fact Austin Oscar Borg

Oscar will tell you that Nia Nigel

Laura's actual lair is in the zenith our

guild hideout they start looking eyes

evil ins just like standing at the side

of the room tapping her foot and finally

it's over we've left wipes paulten ashes

from Strix and it's like and just walks

off toward the spires alright look you

Nausicaa will tell you in passing is

just to sort of create conversation as

you head to the spires that the Zanna

thar guild is not sort of its members

are scattered all over the city and they

typically live in the sewers or in

Dungeon complexes underneath the sewers

but the zanaffar itself has a main layer

a dungeon complex where Nigel or and

even nazca actually have spent a fair

amount of time and he says it's really

well guarded but there is one major flaw

in its defense and that is the Zanna

thar's pet fish it would go crazy if

that fish were taken or killed and

Magnus instinctually reaches for his pet

fish the magic fish Steven the goldfish

that hangs on his Bell it's like I

understand

[Laughter]

Nazca says nothing is more important to

the beholder than that damn fish Andrew

you make your way into the castle Ward

you see this you see the gleaming golden

spires above the other rooftops you come

to the central plaza where the where

they Palace like temple sits you enter

the edifice you see its white marble

walls gleaming being cleaned

probably every hour of the day you also

see glass paneled walls separating off

various rooms and things these these

panel glass walls have leaded frames and

the colored glass in them often depict

saints and Sons and sunlight and sun

rays and all kinds of Sun iconography as

you go deeper and deeper and deeper into

the temple which you many of you know

quite well having spent some time here

there are marble staircases leading up

into the spires there are small private

confessionals and chambers of worship

there's also big tall alcoves and you

can see at this very moment a statue of

evil and standing in one of those

hallowed alcoves in a prominent position

and being stared at by a group of people

who look like the tourists and the the

priests who sort of the acolyte who's

guiding them through is describing her

as the the one of the temples great

heroes this is new right oh this is

brand-new this this this statue doesn't

look like it's resided in this alcove

for more than a few days and you over

here as you're passing by that this

statue was the money to carve it was

donated by house and Catherine as you

well know the richest of the noble Wafaa

Davian houses I'm Catherine Catherine

does that name ring a bell for me hmm

make a intelligence able and that looks

like that's evylyn right like you know

else it looks

I imagine that evens walking in like

with purpose you know cuz she's this is

like walking into high school like

you've been here a million times

attention it's like everything is

familiar and she's just like on this

mission with these ashes and she's just

kind of like walking walking walking

yeah you look taller when you're on top

of a plinth as it turns out yeah you can

see it the other thing you notice is

that there's a golden sheen to the

statue and it's actually rendered

evylyn as construct what oh whoa Wow

and what was the family name you said em

Catherine and with a 17 did I know yeah

so when you died and your soul was drawn

into the soul monger you had you have

this dim memory of having met somebody

there by that name the trigger is a

memory and then you realize oh it's the

boy I thought so so this is the first

time I'm remembering that boy yes the

little boy and I I'm like well I'm

Catherine how did they but what is oh no

she's just so overwhelmed she just kind

of hides and like walks past the statue

like huh yeah and you realize that you

can't remember what the boys first name

was but you realize you remember that he

he talked to you about something do with

a horse

I remember the horses yah horses

something with horse yeah but yeah she

like as soon as this this just becomes

very a lot and she's holding Colton's

ashes and so she sees that and the

symbol of levander and her other hand

and she's like huh and just like hides

from that and continues walking to her

already Matt Magness is gonna do a

stealth check to kind of hold this

shield up in her so it's almost like

well yeah 18 okay excellent you succeed

you're able to cut through the temple

and see a train apparently uh you see

father son bright

standing on a balcony having a

conversation actually he's sort of

berating or chastising waving his finger

at an acolyte but when he when they see

you they stop and father somebody she

was the acolyte away and immediately

comes down the stairs that's light belly

and I met him before I think right I

don't think you guys know no because he

was not he was not here when you guys

were staying at the temple he was

actually the priest of another temple in

Dague referred got it well Strix doesn't

like any of these people so she's just

hiding in a corner evylyn takes a knee

as he descends the stairs and kind of

like vows with respect I can't believe

you she she holds out the symbol of

levander that she knows as his he looks

at it and he says how did you come by

this I thought I'd lost it

just yesterday I believed it was a sign

of the morning Lord in His Holy Majesty

reminding me where my true place was

well I'll have to speak to that acolyte

again then structuralist high-five

Magnus a little yes I was I was a little

cruel toward him I regret that now even

kind of just how are you doesn't doesn't

know what to say that um I I apologized

that it's taken me so long to return I I

know that I should have checked in

sooner thank you by the way Thank You

Magnus for bringing her back to us

don't mention it I definitely yeah

you're welcome yeah he he says or

immediately sort of begins to tell you

that the past year has been very

difficult the the priesthood has had

really no way to deal with the death

curse that had

taken hold but when it was lifted

divination spells and whatnot revealed

that you had a hand in it or more

precisely someone you and someone named

omen ah--this drawn you were you were

essentially responsible for destroying

some sort of evil god thing that was

feeding on the souls and he was

responsible for destroying the device

that was trapping the souls and you

kinda did it at the same time in the

exact same moment even though it doesn't

remember this though right like she

doesn't remember any of that

no not really no when he says that does

she her reaction is it like that that

sounds plausible or is it like no they

haven't wrong

she has no experience to relate to it so

it doesn't sound right somehow and the

fact that it's tied to omen it's just a

weird coincidence but the name omens

Robin Paul is just like no I like that

guy but sighs the death curse has ended

and once more we can bring people back

from the dead you know funny you should

mention that or at least I can you you

can I know this is just back we have so

much to talk about a lot to talk about

and I know it's so weird to ask for a

favor just like wow this is going on

evil and you can see sort of in the

background tapestries of Liffe Endor are

being taken down off the walls excuse

what is happening here she doesn't stop

she's like I so much to talk about

obviously a lot to talk about but you

said about bringing people back from the

dead I was wondering if maybe that's

something you could do like right this

second oh absolutely

I'd be happy holds up the ashes all my

tricks tricks I'll see you and she'll

shuffle over with the scroll and

dealings I got one of these what's that

it's a true resurrection skull pot

scroll possibly from the house from a

bunch of hags

I'm six is the part where I come back

watch watch watch he looks at the scroll

and he says yes yes this this looks like

it could work it's some of the writing

is a little beyond me but I'm sure with

some research and some assistance I can

have it figured out in no time grease

grease some palms this is where that

comes out oh yeah the palms give him

some gold evylyn that's it is that this

is the negotiation part omen taught me

that then like after they say that Paul

is just like see that tech guy stop

fading my stats right now it's gonna be

fine okay he's between evylyn and sun

bright she would know whether it would

be appropriate to offer him any money so

he you would be offering the temple

money essentially and that's always

appreciated because it's a distributed

among various worthy causes and it is it

is there are expert

the spell and it can be a bit of a

burden even on a large temple even takes

the giant bag of 2,000 gold and kind of

like she's kind of pulled it back

towards her and yes we'll take that I

just I would just appreciate it if an

acolyte comes over and just sort of

drags it away if you could give any any

speed or care I would really appreciate

it I was to open a bakery absolutely

would you join me your friends can make

themselves comfortable around over there

on the bench for instance just knock on

the you know the imaginary door what if

we need their help

we won't are you sure yes that thing I

was broken points at waffles oh I

thought you meant me

yes sir points over your shoulder Magnus

at the big al bear behind you

that thing is named waffles and she and

obedient and listen to us oh good evylyn

design you know you can do this sander

stuffs tricks like Pat's the bench next

door okay okay yeah okay so you guys

evylyn you go off with father-son bright

and the ashes of paltin and the scroll

of true resurrection after she leaves

yeah death well I can take a seat next

to Strix and Kyle address her but almost

like watching people and as she leaves

he's like you heard what she said right

wait which part the part where we got

here and even said that she was supposed

to be

the whole time

I don't like that that's not true no no

it's not a couple of points back we'll

hit it really hard

some more acolytes come by and ask you

to stand while they take the old bench

which has sort of inscriptions of

Lysander and they put a new bench down

in its place wait wait wait why are you

taking it taking away the little hander

bench they don't say anything

wait what is the new bench say it has a

it has a son like design and some

inscriptions on it that that you can

probably translate it seems to pertain

to somebody or someone named a monitor

oh oh oh not all minato I don't I never

understood that right cuz I only read it

in a video game

Oh Magnus says in thieves can't - DF

how's your stealth subconsciously DF

channels a little bit of Paul - just

goes my dear how's my stealth

so yeah I'm between Strix --is brat form

and ourselves I suggest that we get

maybe a little bit closer to that

conversation and we don't this is

feeling real pinkie leaving evil in the

lone it's that just me am I wrong I

don't believe she's in danger but

something's going on here you guys wanna

make health checks yeah should you are

you gonna tell us trickster rats cuz

she's miss she doesn't understand

thieves can't she's like they're doing

hand things again it's so fun to watch

yeah I got a 23 and then we do kind of

like a Strix ok I got 27 all right make

a stealth check Strix

and this sort of pristine temple seeing

a mighty black rat sort of crawling

through is well so but you're probably

you're probably like falling like along

the corners of the walls and things yeah

behind tapestries and fonts and not

actually crossing the main floors

yeah that's nineteen okay you're all the

old role really well paltin haip Alton

there is what you get this strange

feeling of your your psyche your spirit

your mind and your body all sort of

coming back together as though they were

all kind of in separate rooms and but

suddenly joined in one place and when

you open your eyes there's sunlight

washing down on top of you evylyn what

you've just witnessed is father-son

bright successfully casting the scroll

which goes blank after he uses it and

during the course of the casting he

utters prayers to a manotaur not

levander this is troubling but your

friend palton is on this padded plinth

there are a couple acolytes standing

corners who just kind of ring dongs bum

every ten seconds or so and they do it

together when paltin awakens and sits up

you feel the warmth feel the one from

the Sun upon you evylyn is staring at

sun bright as he's saying prayers to i'm

a nod to her and like he rolls up the

scroll to put it back in the case and

hands it to

palton and says a memento do I remember

getting at least getting disintegrated

there was this feeling where like your

body was gone and you could just see

your like hands turning to dust and then

that's it

Paulding wakes up and like takes a

second and remembers and goes oh perkins

even like still has dust up to her

elbows like she hasn't even cleaned up

yeah and she sees him sit up and she

just goes

paltin says uh uh uh also like just like

oh we're crying now okay and just like

grabs Kirk and hugs her well your two

are hugging Luke sunbright is to sort of

standing next to you his golden beard

and curly golden hair catching the

bright light almost almost gives him an

aura and then he says having done that

the gold is a great boon to the temple

thank you for all that you've done I

could use your help personally in in

this mm-hmm she kind of did in dis

entangles herself from from

she's like of course anything in the

service of the morning Lord absolutely

so since the passing of mothers arrests

there hasn't been a high priest

determined for this temple I am of

course the leading candidate and could

use your support for all that you've

done to end the death curse your words

would carry tremendous weight within the

clergy and given our past relationship

and how seen each other

I figure the two of us can make this

temple stronger than it's ever been

I am just curious because when you were

praying just now I was a little

surprised to hear the name I'm not or

instead of Lysander and I was just

curious what that meant

Paul Nesta porridge is like Oh appalling

he says well

Lysander is the reincarnation of ominous

aura I manito is the ancient one uh-huh

so why it is that it is he who is the

foundation of our faith mm-hmm

but they are wondering the same all

manotaur isla fender yeah but why change

everything now why why'd we praise

Lysander before now we're I mean is it

just like an aesthetic change like a

rebrand he says to an extent but it is

always good to remember the past and to

reach and bring forth the past so that

doesn't become lost forever

mm-hmm when he says that we've always

seen each other well is that something

that

evylyn agrees with he was when you when

you visited the temple of Lysander the

the morning glow top morning glow tower

in Dague referred he was always

respectful to you

yeah I imagine he was like tough but

fair yeah I know yeah you guys you were

young you were sort of flirting with an

adventuring career not going for the

clerical path but for the paladin path

and sort of running off in the temple

and you could see that maybe he had a

sort of disapproving there's a hint of

disapproving Ness to that but that is

gone you don't see that at all anymore

if the side canon writing is to be

believed he was tough on her but helped

train her to become as strong as she was

right okay so she's like well I I can't

think of a better candidate so of course

you have my support he smiles and says

well I'll let you reunite with your

friends hey thanks that's real nice I

have some other matters to attend to

nice to see you again and pleasure to

meet you paulten do we need to roll now

to see if when they over the door we

totally can yes if you want you by the

way the rest of you have heard all of

this and you've seen Paul tins awakening

people ins like I I can just I can just

go there's nothing you don't need any

anything like well you're going to be in

you're going to be staying in the city

for a while are you mm-hmm perhaps you

could come by and we could go out for

lunch sometime catch up talk about the

future okay um may them the light of the

morning Lord shine upon you how do you

wrestle your deal in here stealth drugs

Oh 48

okay 29 all right okay so the rats are a

bit of a giveaway they pile out of the

shadows far I just kind of like looks up

he's like oh my god stop chat shut up

just let it happen when it does Jesus

Mac Magnus comes walking in like he's

been a long way we're like Oh

evylyn oh sorry oh come on

I thought this is the bathroom Oh

evylyn kind of like takes fault ins Han

did does he need anything like when he

just came back from ashes like how am i

yeah probably you probably could use a

long rest but other than that speak you

like clothes or is he just like draped

oh my oh he's probably he's probably

wearing something modest but mmm that's

it like a like like he's probably just

wearing one of the temple robes yeah

yeah so he's actually kind of dressed

like a son priest acolyte right now

Strix is laughing at him you look kind

of like looks him up and down she's like

we all need our rest right yeah I have

something I want to show you that I

think is gonna help with that so follow

me come with me okay just gonna turn

back into strict so got rats once she's

gone yes so yes she assumes her true

form as you sort of follow Magnus out of

the temple everybody just make

perception checks to see if you notice

anything interesting I rolled a one okay

distracted

I got a fourteen okay I'm natural 20 up

to 31 okay

14 DF you notice as everybody is

withdrawing that there is a priest and

acolyte basically an old woman in the

garb of Lysander she's got a gold and

white habit a robe that hangs down

golden slippers she is watching you

leave and her expression is one of grave

concern and it looks like she wants to

intercede and talk to you but then

something kind of stays her hand and she

realizes maybe this is the wrong time

but she looks nervous and afraid and you

can see by the way what looks like a

bronze carved symbol of Lysander being

car

- the way behind her like from one side

of the frame

yeah yeah uh I but she's very clearly

wearing levander garb yes and al

offender holy symbol draped over her

neck

dang I'll I'll give her her look to know

that I noticed her noticing

I don't know how else to really convey

it unless she knows thieves can't just

like a quick look around and then kind

of like a quick nod to direction we are

going and then back her giving her a

quick nod yes and then I continue

following Magnus to whatever magical

happy place he has in his pocket or

whatever the okay you notice as you

follow Magnus and company out that this

priestess has also sort of followed you

and watches you leave and we're get

Magnus so here's the thing so last chair

con last year's chair con I was here in

water deep and I kind of started

formulating a plan okay sort of a

retirement thing but more of just like

I'm gonna do that and I've kind of been

working on it over the past year getting

all the deals done and I actually just

like during just before chair con this

year closed on it and I kind of have a

plan for it but for now I just wanted to

show you and he brings them to you also

you know a coach ride later blah blah

blah blah blah you sort of cross a few

streets of town you head from the castle

Ward into the North Ward along one of

the main thoroughfares and then you come

to an alley that you take the cart

through and there's this big stone

archway that you pass through into a

street surrounded on all sides by tall

buildings many of them quite old and

fabulous so there was a building here

that

this older couple bond with Danes

mention of turning into a B&B and they

never ended up finishing it so I bought

it eventually I'm gonna find the time to

come in and finish it but that's not

gonna be for a couple years so I was

thinking I mean I I'm not gonna be able

to hang out here and want to eat much

longer I got to get back to my school

and to my friends and everything so

would you all want to watch over it for

me while I was gone you see this

incredible mansion on a corner and and

parts of it look weathered and worn and

probably could use some fixing up and

such but the structure seems basically

sound the windows are all shuttered for

the most part and there's all these sort

of verandas and balconies perched on it

at various levels for a bakery and

that's pretty cool and evylyn there's

one in the attic that connects to

turrets overlooks beautiful sunrise I

thought you would like that but also the

first floor is the tap room with a full

kitchen Oh Magnus this this is far more

than we could ever and also just FYI I

in shorted out the ass so like you don't

worry about if there's like a dragon or

anything like that don't know there

probably will be yeah I figured and I've

been kind of going back and forth about

different names but I have an idea

tell me what you think about this Waffle

House SEO on that oh oh my over did yep

he's just like he's a guest player kind

of guest player give us a house he's not

giving us anything we're yeah no we're

talking about a lease

like ten gold Imam something reasonable

cuz I mean I plan on eventually flipping

it and selling

you know I mean so this is why that's

like you'll be like caretakers of it

more than anything else

and just if you happen to unfortunately

pass away would that just mean that it

was ours

well canonically I'm not going to do

that where's the piece of paper a

contract or something where we got to

give you our magnets describes abused

baby rights you can stay here for ten

golden take the contract like I I'm not

I'm not used to this is pretty solid

you're kinda turns back to the party

he's like Colton's gone up to like one

of the windows and into this yeah go

this big gigantic taproom beyond with

this huge bar and yeah toss it I tossed

the keys to Bolton okay yeah stop this

thing

can we make a match can we make magic

here is there magic

room a pantry a kitchen on the upper

floors it's got a big common room a big

den on upstairs hall one two three four

bedrooms a library study private baths

balconies and attic storage and a

private turret well well you heard him

why don't you guys go enjoy Paulin has

already like chugged a concerning amount

of wine it's like now I know this is a

dream sequence so I'm gonna take

advantage of it for it is basically like

oh you kids go have fun this isn't gonna

go in until Dee it goes in she's not

gonna she's just like let's go would it

be okay if I talk to Diaz just one

second oh yeah I won't wraps around you

just a minute there's a basement that

sounds awesome

check it out yeah she just Rick runs

away like Muppet runs like says she's

down there in seconds yep

it's so big dia I hope I hope this isn't

too much I mean really I was planning on

doing this anyways you're doing me a

favor keeping an eye on it also was just

gonna set empty for like three or four

years no we we needed a place to stay

and this is this is more than I could

ever the North Ward is one of the nicest

wards and all of Waterdeep yeah this is

more than I've ever and will ever be

able to give any of them well don't

think of it that way because you have

you got them here you know what I mean

look thank I I wanted to tell you

something before I go I remembered one

thing about the person that I traveled

with it's not much

ZDF actually I tense up a little bit oh

I swear to you I've been trying so hard

to remember all I can remember is kind

of a crescent scar from like middle of

eyebrow kind of around like that you

know what I mean like I said I can't

even guarantee it's any connection to

you whatsoever it just seems right but

there is one more thing I wanted to say

about it before I go don't spend so much

time looking for your father that you

miss the fact that you've already found

your family gia thanks guys there's a

surprise living by this and turns back

and just says this might be the first

time you've got me completely wrong I've

never been trying to find him I know

exactly where I belong in who I belong

with that's an important thing to learn

I I lost my family a long time ago a

horrible horrible man took them from me

and it's a thing that for a long long

time I thought I would never be able to

replace and then I made a new family and

I had new experiences with them and grew

even stronger than I did before and I

want the same for you and for your

friends and for your family take care of

them you know they're they're great I'm

happy to hear that for you Magnus and I

will take care of them and unlike you

this is the only family I've ever had

well if you need anything and Magnus

handsome so in our game we have these

things called stones of far speech that

let you like contact other people

they're like pagers and Magnus gives one

to DF tuned to his if you ever need me

you ever need anything from me let me

know I can I have a whole magical Canon

thing I can get here pretty quickly so

you need anything let me know okay

I appreciate that Magnus and it's I

don't know how much it's worth back to

you but should you ever need us you know

where to find me he goes in for a

handshake we another Magnus tangent it's

like it's like the handshake enjoy yeah

yeah now go check out the house leaving

her head out one of the bathroom already

like like shower you know there'll be

some rats peeking out from like a

basement window and they'll is all wave

together with little rat hands

I actually before I go I have taken like

a ton of damage can I come take

little pieces and rent alright I guess

breakfast so yeah he'll crash it'll

crash for a while the rest of you make

yourself at home the Strix you can see

down in the cellar there's some evidence

that people have been kind of rooting

down there recently looking for

well knowing our pipes no effort tidying

up the place you get the impression that

maybe you know you might need to shore

up the security down here

they must be digging in from somewhere

but you love the fact that the

sort of rough carved out cellars in the

basement or so spacious and have so many

nooks and crannies to stick stuff in

excellent paltin your your sort of drink

you've drained one bottle out into a

glass and drank that you sort of ducked

down underneath the bar to root around

and see if you can find something you

haven't tried yet

and when you come out with something

that you look you want to try and you

look up at the bar there is a bottle of

wine pouring itself into your glass and

then just sort of sets it down beside

mom just takes it is like I'm gonna put

a pin in that and then you just see sort

of the the cork go in the top of the

bottle okay and then the bottle just

sort of float over toward a shelf and

lay itself in there this place is

awesome and that's what happened this is

a normal house so I have odd already at

my desk good thing I have a floor plan

to send you guys oh my god it's actually

our house like we're not gonna get like
