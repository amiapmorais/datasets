hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action

oh hi oh boy whoa boy

before we jump into the action let me

just tell the tech crew at the back

there that I can't see any of my players

so but I can hear their delightful

voices and so what about our crazy faces

that's what well you know and we're

shocked in a fog so last time in dice

camera action the characters escaped

from captain's on dollas airship via

teleport spell and wound up in the

tropical city of Port and ions are oh

and there they found a place to hole up

for the night and with the aid of their

guide artists Cimber are preparing to

embark on their expedition into the

jungle but there is a lingering matter

of the party's well-being their physical

well-being if not their emotional

well-being and emotional so to give them

added protection against the death curse

d/f acquired a scroll and some ink which

when combined created this arcane ritual

that Strix cast that is summoning three

hags over the course of three nights to

do something to three of you to protect

you in a way it doesn't seem to do any

good to evil in because of her construct

nature so last night well three of the

four of you slept

you were visited and written by a hag

yeah who who spit into your mouth and

then the next morning when you woke up

and you have just as gross the second

time

in the morning you woke up you had

breakfast downstairs and deaath saw a

flying snake chased out into the street

and it darted down an alleyway and

disappeared from his view DF would you

like to do anything you're out on the

streets till waffles is sort of howling

at you to be released from her post

where she basically spent the whole

night oh I feel bad I thought she liked

it down there I thought she was having

sneaky sneaks but it's been a whole

night all right I'll rob her real quick

and give her a quick reassuring you know

pet and then I'm gonna dash back into

the rest of the party okay there's

basically say I think we're being

watched by a flying snake thingy a wet

flying snake thing chilean like bert

like snake but I had bird wings oh okay

and it seemed to be way too intent of

looking at and listening to us and

watching us does it seem nice maybe it

wants to join the party

that's not nice evylyn nothing is ever

nice maybe you're like oh no keep no

keep rambling it's fine I mean look we

have an owl bear and we have our

beautiful construct son and I don't

think we should make assumptions about a

little snake bird I don't think we

should be adding it anymore can I do

like an arc on it check to know maybe

this is like a familiar or something

sure like maybe some sort of 21 it very

well could be yes it could also just be

an ordinary flying snake doubtless this

land is full of them great this place is

filled with flying snakes oh I don't

know my sake for a friend oh okay I

guess it's possible but I'll just pace

on the way that one was watching one of

the workers at kaya's house of repose

will tell you if you are interested in

buying any sort of creature you'll want

to deal with any of the merchants who

are associated with the merchants prints

Fonterra he is the one who basically has

the monopoly on beasts and beasts

training

I love beasts no paltin don't give her

that money don't don't give her any

money to buy an animal takes politics

money I am a woman of means and she like

ruffles through her pouch that she has

an access the entire game looking for

money

there's no money in there she is a

strong independent robot thing yeah

that's right well if we're being watched

we should set up some kind of trap or

failsafe or something to make sure that

we aren't continued to be watched maybe

it was a fan and it got really shy

okay I'm using a shy flying snake I

haven't seen any flying snakes so I'm

just not making assumptions or we could

die we'll probably die that's fine again

now that's no yeah just like Vietnam

flashbacks oh that's right

looks pointedly at Paul to the neck well

I I want to go and use the ins kitchen

do you think they would let me can I go

ask them if I can use their kitchen when

you do they object

no no not strenuously like they don't

push you out or anything but they they

give you scowls

as you I drew I just want to bake a

couple of pies I'll give you one make a

persuasion check okay oh I didn't do

very good I'm twelve they will let you

but they watch everything that you do

great I'll wash my hands then okay now I

wanted to bake three pies okay and I'm

also going to take hair from Paulson and

eat when they're not looking

so yeah okay well no I'm just gonna do

I'm just gonna run by

like hey friend rip it out of their hand

okay and so and the behavior yeah all

right cool while they're debating the

snake or whatever whatever they're

waiting I'm just gonna take him back to

the room be like this is for tonight I'm

hoping that maybe we can use these

instead of them no no touching us so I'm

just gonna keep them in the room maybe

they'll take those instead of being mean

to us just don't wear your hair isn't it

pulse and it's fine yeah it'll just say

well I don't know what you're talking

about I slept fine last night he's great

uh-huh

why didn't you make me one strikes we'll

just like she'll just like walk back and

hand evil and just like I don't know

something from a robe like it it's like

a cookie here I made you a cookie oh my

gosh I love it it's like I've got some

extra like some things you collected in

there you can't you can't even eat it it

doesn't even it's just walks off totally

callous so like the she was super

mean the evil in saying she can't even

eat

even still treasuring it like it's one

of smells special earwax cookies that's

not my problem

what flavor are the pies I'm gonna say

that they're I mean I mean we're in

Schultz Oh what barrier what what sort

of things could we find there is a local

berry called a sin de berry there we go

yeah so they'll all be cinder berries

but with different people's hair in it

and like symbols on the top denial berry

pie and is is like don't eat them don't

eat them like look like actually says

that to the whole in database all right

I'm sure those are delicious no we're

taking a lot of time whatever is

watching us this means that you were

trying to find what we're going or

they're looking specifically for us and

based on how that airship went something

tells me they're looking for us so we

need to get out of here

you're more importantly than that we

need to help we need to help Alton we

help ourselves

you did I've got to do this thing for

shemekka coming after you were also

gonna get some gear I think gorgeous yes

yeah okay yeah so we need start making

her wait or

or illunga i think we should do that

soon we're gonna go shopping your guide

artists went upstairs shortly before the

the snake took off he's still upstairs

at in his room presumably okay d/f go

get him and ask him about the snake he's

probably smarter than us well you guys

go ask

I'm gonna go procure some things that

we're definitely going to need for this

trip like a dinosaur yep see I you're

smarter at that that's exactly I'm going

to get can you get a cute one yeah I'm a

fast one so we can race it you should

take paulsen because we don't have any

money

yeah Dalton you want to come oh sure

even you should check on waffles she was

distraught this morning she needs some

love okay maybe I could go look at

dinosaurs too and maybe I'll find a

really good dinosaur and maybe we'll

find that we'll find a good one first

then we'll tell you about it that way

you just see once the best only see the

best one

let's go Alton listenings all I know is

that we're gonna buy dinosaur don't let

him buy a boring one Politan I'm gonna

be honest this did not go well for me

last time don't rub poop on them just as

well I'm you know I wasn't gonna but now

that the thoughts are all right so DF

and palton head off

evylyn will look after waffles Strix

will finish off making sure her pies

don't burn and then ya set them upstairs

where they can cool and not be eaten by

anyone I take waffles for a walk oh okay

like just a stroll around chill and I

also if I meet anyone interesting I'm

totally like new to the neighborhood and

just chatting people up and introducing

myself and showing off offal is learning

the patterns okay well suffice to say a

puppet like woman basically pulling an

owl bear along does it totally normal

the tracks have a fair share of

attention yes but people give you a wide

berth because of the ferocity of

this behemoth that you're trying I tell

them about how I'm here with paltin step

on the joys of dying tour and also that

and I'm also with Strix the famous

dinosaur racer and we're looking for a

dinosaur right now that we're gonna race

soon and all that that's what I like as

I meet people that's what I tell them

about myself okay

you're able to get some free information

about where you can buy dinosaurs and

different kinds of dinosaurs and people

ask you what kind of dinosaur are you

looking for I ask for advice

okay about what what's the best kind of

dinosaur that's the cutest and fastest

oh my god well if you want something

they tell you if you want something

sized for you then a healthy hail

ankylosaurus will probably do you quite

nicely they're seeing they're fast

runners they can really buck it but it

is just and difficult to train however

okay but what if someone was bigger than

me

mmm yeah then your best bet is to

probably get oh just something like a

Hadrosaurus and it doesn't know what

either of those dinosaurs look like evil

and probably doesn't either

the squat four legged dudes but they got

the ball and their tail face oh yeah oh

cool okay alright and the boys as you

guys head off you're sort of channeled

by the early morning crowds into a place

called the red Bazaar and it's this it's

at this big broad intersection and it's

full of traffic and people and things to

buy whereas the grand souk is a much

more sort of high-end buy jewelry kind

of place this is more like where you get

everyday items there are big slabs of

dinosaur meat that are hung out to dry

with buckets to collect the blood

underneath them there's people trading

in all sorts of things wine fruit

clothing insect repellent rain catchers

and other basic basic goods great

there's even a place that sells canoes

you didn't see a big giant can you sort

of suspended over a doorway Oh excellent

some of those actually artist told you

he secured one already okay this is the

155 wasn't a knock a canoe will fit well

a canoe will fit six of you okay

not so much the albear no all bears and

canoes don't really go together well do

all bears swim they the same way bears

can swim which is pretty good okay all

right mm-hmm all right so the only

things I'm looking to procure here are

just a lot of the basic adventury

supplies restocks on rations water skins

mm-hmm

yeah even secure rations you can secure

your water skins a few personal effects

such as flasks of oil and caltrops yawn

yep

how many fossil you want you can get a

bag of caltrops no problem there okay

you can get however many flasks of oil

you want all right I'll get one bag of

caltrops okay and go with three flasks

of oil very good doo doo doo so then you

know I also want to acquire a lot of the

more Wow local equipment such as insect

repellent it sounds awesome okay it's

tents for outside sleeping tarps rope

etc line okay and the insect repellent

comes in two forms a block of incense

that when lit burns for up to eight

hours and repels insects within a cloud

around it essentially or you can get a

gourd or vial of a South which you

basically spread on your it's like an

odorless grease that you spread on your

side I think I'll get the incense

because I think you'd like that the

advantage of the one is incense is great

like if you're making

and you just want to keep the bugs away

yeah a sob is great if you are traveling

around or if you have to go into water

and re-emerge it's actually sort of

waterproof it doesn't come off oh so do

I can I get one of each yep sure okay

everything you've asked for up to this

point is gonna cost you about five gold

yeah that's like nothing yeah the whole

time the whole time he's like asking for

like these necessary things I'm like

also see if they have like a collar that

lets you talk to dinosaurs I like just

deadpan her back to the shop owner he

thinks that's a great idea and you

should invent one okay um hold on I'll

take you something else all right

while idea--this shopping palton make a

perception check those are always good

and while he's doing that a df1 of the

shop owners as you're sort of as he's

inventory all the stuff that you're

collecting he asks you if you want to

rent a mule or a person to carry your

stuff around for you in town I mean oh

it's good you see other people kind of

do that big shoppers who come through

here and buy a lot of things they either

have a mule or they have a person who's

acting as a mule who's like a servant

just following them around I'm not

comfortable with the servant angle mule

sounds fine okay just I'm assuming that

Simon went with you guys he wouldn't

have stayed yes I'm it's probably

following popping around rent a mule for

the day okay so Paul so for my

perception check you know the the

picture of the lady who is like trying

to like figure stuff out with all the

like so that's me trying to figure out

how I would make a collar that talks to

dinosaurs don't fixate it on that cuz I

roll the two

okay you can fight no that won't wait

what if I know what language do

dinosaurs understand okay then a DF

yours you've basically acquired all this

stuff and you've got a mule to help you

take it back to the inn where you're

staying sweet

you see paltin very distracted use you

notice that Simon has wandered off he's

not around

Paul turn your sign I make a persimmon

do okay oh my son

this one's on you it happens little kid

gets lost in a big crowd see something

shiny

you actually Simon is a very colorfully

dressed little guy in fact it's pretty

easy to spot you sort of stand up on a

barrel just kind of look around and yeah

you spot him right away you see that he

has gone off into a corner of behind

some of these slabs of dinosaur meat

that are hanging he sort of run behind

them and is chasing after something kind

of playfully like a kid lured away by

like a small animal or something in this

case however he seems to be chasing

after a monkey and the monkey is wearing

a little Fez do you see my son yes he's

right over there

about like 50 60 feet away and there's

about two dozen people criss crossing

between you and where you see him but I

just like Naruto run through the crowd

okay so palton I'll let you make another

perception check with advantage because

a DF is pointed out where you need to go

you still haven't said 18 okay you do

catch sight of Simon as he sort of you

see him and a monkey has just thrown

what looks like a ball to him and he's

thrown it back to the monkey and the

monkey kind of runs away with it and

then Simon chases after the monkey and

then they stop and they do that need to

play

again and then they run a little bit

farther away you think pretty clearly

this monkey is leading Simon astray

can I catch up to him yes you can weave

through the crowd and by now DF you can

see paltin has sort of cut through the

crowd disappeared behind the slabs of

meat and it's kind of deacon into an

alley to catch up to Simon and you can

see him sort of reach Simon right at the

mouth of the alley

okay paltin when you catch up to Simon

he stops he looks at you no surprise

there and then he points at the monkey

and the monkey standing there with a

ball and little Fez on its head and then

the monkey throws the ball at you palton

like in a catch this kind of way and

it's a rubber ball about this big around

I thought it was gonna be monkey poop so

this ball comes hurtling toward you not

fast is it is it like coming at me like

like far up or is it just kind of

rolling toward me I the monkey tosses it

but he sort of underhands it so it just

kind of lobs toward you okay

yes actually it probably bounces once

because it's rubber and then boom do you

aim to catch it I'm just gonna like let

it roll I'm not I don't wanna try okay

it's just bounces and then sort of rolls

between your legs disappears into the

crowd behind you

the monkey shrieks at you are you

looking I'm just what and then the

monkey gestures like this it's like and

begins to make his way deeper down the

alleyway and I just turn around okay

it's like nope nope I don't want any of

that all right I'm gonna take my son and

go back to how am I pretty far from deep

at this point yeah you're about 60 70

feet away from DF D at least you still

have I contact with paltin so paulten

when you look over you can see di

standing on a bear

all higher than the crowd nearby my mule

cool can i reception check okay yeah

sure okay what do you want you see a

shadow of a figure on a roof above Paul

Tim's head just sort of moved into

position what do you say moved into

position has sort of come the the roof

above him and to the right is kind of

flat and it's got a bit of a lip that

figures on the roof can hide behind

almost like a Battlement but it's more

kind of ornate and stylized it's not

meant to be like a really a defensive

thing but this whoever this is on the

roof this dark cloaked figure is using

it to block line of sight as much as

possible and he's moved into position

and just sort of peers over down at

palton can I call out to DF you see if

you see what appears to be a hand

crossbow yep there's a hole palton

hasn't seen this and is kind of making

his way back all right I'm standing on

top of a barrel yeah all right yeah I

don't know if you'll be able to hearing

it from me or through the crowd but I'll

just I'll shout from here Paul don't

move at the same time I jump forward

from the barrel a bunch of crowd people

just sort of turn as you do this yeah

and then like grab onto like a sign pull

like swing off of it to like get as far

as possible it's like - my way Jeff

Alton as fast as possible

so in order to get across him to him as

fast as possible there are some penance

and things hanging overhead they're not

particularly sturdy you could you could

basically one-hand it along one of those

or did I hear him you definitely heard

him and most of the crowd did as well

paltin you think you are sorry da if you

think you might be able to get to him

quickest if you ran across the heads and

shoulders of the crowd I want to do that

I want to do that that's what I want to

do

immediately after you call out to me can

I just I just kind of like and like

perfectly just like throw a hood up oh

all right do you want it to be

transparent or opaque from the UH I

don't really think about it I just throw

up whatever is instinctive so I guess I

guess opaque okay so this black sphere

that you can see out of paltin but

nobody can really see in very well just

springs up all around him as a defensive

mechanism and it sort of pushes some of

the crap away some people so we get

hedged out by it and thrown back on

their butts when it appears idea of

making acrobatics check after the hut

comes up and dislike shape space 18

all right you nimbly stride across the

heads and shoulders of various crowd

folks who grunt and groan and cry out

underneath you and land on the outside

of the dome so just a side thought was I

in the crowd or was I pretty separate

and you were kind of separated yeah okay

I was gonna say her there like sorry

there are but since they can leave they

probably will have they will you can go

if you want

yeah they choose to go okay that's

probably for the best

it's Simon in that he is yeah okay

all right so DF you have reached Paul

toons Hut okay and then from there I

basically want to do you say it was a

baker transparent okay Nate okay yeah of

course here

all right from there I'm basically to

chase after that man okay you can run up

the outside of the dome of the hut and

basically get up to the roof that way

holding my second-story work class

feature it should be real easy to me to

climb up and get up there totally plan

to this it good

yeah good synergy yeah you did a good

job you gave him that little vault he

needed to get up to the room yeah I'm

like well done Michael this is like us

bringing us up a hot job mm-hmm all

right

when you land on the roof I'm gonna ask

you to make another perception check to

see if you notice anything other than

this dude you do see a second

similarly black-clad figure on another

rooftop on the other side of the alley

so that that would put him her him or

her about 30 feet away from you with an

alley gap between you now this one that

you're confronting is in fact a woman

but she is she's wearing black silks

looks like not armor per se and she's

got silk over most of her face except

her eyes and she's got her hand crossbow

in one hand and a short sword in the

other and I need you yes to roll

initiative like 23 okay evylyn make a

perception check ooh I would love to I'm

not gonna use my lucky die yet though

I've gotta save that are you outside

with waffles yeah oh my god 12 okay

all you hear is a bit of a ruckus of

some kind coming from what appears to be

a crowded intersection about a hundred

yards away from you you're talking to

somebody here's having a conversation

talking about the death and dying tour

people are looking at you mystified and

not sure what to make of you some are

just staying away from you you try to

talk to them and they just turn and walk

away oh if you all excuse me I hear

something over there and as I am a

paladin in the service of Lysander I

must make sure that everything's all

right come on waffles I jump on her back

and kind of ghulam posters yes all right

as you get closer to the disturbance you

can see fleetingly

what looks like DF spring off the

shoulders

some individuals onto a big black dome

and then from there hurl himself up to

the roof and then you lose sight of him

d/f what do you do you have all right

for the initiative so clearly she's

clearly armed yes I'm clearly

threatening and threatening okay yes

she's threatening him all right and then

other figure across the alley

similarly clad similarly armed equally

threatening but 30 feet away and loading

loading his crossbow all right well good

do you hear me from the hut the hut is

not soundproof so yes okay this like hey

how you doing up there but you can't see

each other because of the angle of the

building but you can definitely hear

each other yeah like I'll stop down

towards this hut but like not leaving I

contact it gets the target just saying

palton upon the rooftops and then got

her out and then I'll just engage with

the one directly ahead of me so that uh

he'll hand crossbows just become a melee

arrangement okay I'm just like okay I'll

find the stairs now if you leave your

Hut paltin the Hut will disappear just

see you now that's fine

I have more also while everyone's

running away I just I just imagine strix

standing in the window of like the top

floor the end just shooing flies away

from her pie and just like watches evil

and like just running off and it's just

like heck yeah watch as the son sees the

commotion and you know you know that

your broom is probably you know in your

room yeah and I'll just look at the pies

yeah just look outside look at the pies

I'll go get my broom yeah it's your

action alright I nothing super fancy all

I can really do is just to make a melee

attack against her okay so

all right 13:13 is dodged yeah when mrs.

alright she is going to attempt to make

two short sword attacks against you

since you are a little close for her to

use her crossbow

yeah the first one is not going to be so

great you were able to dodge that quite

able yeah the second one is a 22 okay

all right and she does

six points of piercing damage with that

blade and I need you to make a

constitution saving throw because there

is poison on it

all right okay this is fine 15 all right

that is enough you do not suffer any ill

effects from this none of the poison

gets into your system really yeah but

from this like I kind of noticed the

poison your yes she's trying to do yes

okay I'm not in the initiative right not

yet but now that the now that this round

has ended I'd like all of the other

three characters to make initiative

checks as well so palton Strix and evil

and good all right I got sixteen sixteen

four six thirteen twelve all right D F

you're up again no I'm sorry I made a

mistake the other one on the other roof

is going to attempt to shoot you DF with

its light with its a hand crossbow okay

and is going to hit you for for piercing

damage and I need you to make a

constitution saving all right I'm candy

dodged that one so you take doing - all

right

another Constitution's they think yes

please all right

- all right you have you are poisoned

well not you there's poison in your

system what that means is when you are

poisoned you have disadvantage on attack

roles and ability checks Oh No okay you

also have a one level of exhaustion

which at this point doesn't affect you

any more than the poison condition does

right it's just the ability of text yeah

yeah okay all right

and yeah you just pull the bolt out of

you you can feel the poison coursing

through your system yeah I'm like

shaking my head and yep struggling to

stand and it's your turn

oh no all right I want them to all right

I'm just gonna take the defense action

okay

like just rather than trying to like

fight to defeat them yeah I mean I'm

just fighting to survive until

ultimately helps okay then they will get

to go again before your crew does the

one with the short sword she will attack

you twice

and what's your armor class currently 17

but no I'm taking defense actually I'll

get the disadvantage yeah I'm rolling

twice on every die here so the first one

hits you okay and the second one would

have crits you but missed you ha roll

the 20 and a 2 alright so the one then

the one that hits you does 5 points of

piercing damage which you can under any

dodge and reduce uh uh defensive and

kinda dodge all right and I need another

Constitution say anything more oh this

is getting way worse I call out again

really quick still good bud that's cool

over 16 okay

you resist that and then the other one

will reload his crossbow and take aim

with another shot oh you rolled a 17 and

18 and so that's gonna be a 24 which is

gonna hit you it does three points of

piercing damage and I mean let me guess

another save you throw okay

11 all right you have now another level

of exhaustion which means your speed is

halved all right all right and then it

is strict Susteren strikes you're able

to get to your room get your broom and

fly out the window if you want yes I'll

fly out the window I'm sure I could

already tell things were going bad

evylyn you come galumphing into the

marketplace with albear startling a

bunch of people and causing some of them

to fall down as they rush away they sort

of don't panic citizens everything is

under control there's a Robocop I'm

gonna have any makeup persuasion check

to know that you are not the Menace that

will appear to be you see what you pull

out your acts in this happened in like

panic before everybody panics start to

scream and trample each other and as

they run through stalls and into homes

and residences and shops and things

think stands get pushed over you see

what appears to be like a back a basket

full of snakes gets pushed over and all

this across the floor and everybody

starts to freak out even more people

start combusting

[Laughter]

suddenly in the entire market within 30

feet all around you is totally clear

except for toppled stuff dropped

paraphernalia and shopping bags and I

see Halton has left his Hut great he has

and he's like he is basically I think

he's going paltin there are sort of

outdoor staircases as well as indoor

ones you're looking to go up through the

inside of the building or up at the

outside of the building so which of

those would be quicker whoo let's say

the outside so how much quicker slash

cooler would it be if I dimension door

it up yeah you could totally do that

cool I'm gonna I'm gonna do that yeah so

yeah you see him just go and up here on

the edge of the roof okay I do you like

a majestic walk out and just like sink

my own angel course like all right and

so evylyn I'm gonna say that basically

the how we're used all of its move to

get you there so you still have your

move and inaction okay actually you have

your just your action not a move sorry

oh I don't have a move correct you have

to use some of your move to steer ah

okay so I can't catch up to them this

turn you can't unless you sacrifice your

action just to move like you can use

your action instead of attacking now to

move whatever your fly speed is with

your boots uh I guess I'll do that to

catch up with them I'm gonna Pat waffles

on the head and be like you stay right

here until I come back you understand

and protect all the people and be nice

don't eat anyone and I take off with my

boots of juice and just head over and

I'm like hey what's what's going on

seems like my not is everything fine you

see DF is in a fight for his life on a

roof with a dark clad assassin of some

kind

and looking uncharacteristically sloppy

yes he looks he looks like he's normally

he's on like he's got sunstroke or

something and then it is actually Paul

tunes turn so you are now standing on

the edge of the roof Alton you've just

stepped out of your door which has

disappeared behind you and how close do

you want to be to death because you can

pretty much decide how close am I

you could be anywhere from like right

behind him to like 30 feet away and I

see these people trying to do a kill of

him right you see one in close combat

with him stabbing at him with her short

sword another one is on another roof on

the other side of an alley of shooting

crossbow bolts about 30 well actually

yeah about 30 feet away from DF can I

and the gap between the roof Iran and

the roof that that second assassin on is

about 10 feet can I try and persuade the

one right on him to stop just using your

you're an ordinary persuasion or a spell

of some kind I'm gonna go with ordinary

persuasion okay

hey please don't I just call out like

stand down really heroic Lee wait let me

see how heroic Lee is that's that's a

that's a 10 so it's like sis stand down

maybe alright wait assignment with me

well that's a very good question let me

it goes check the spell I think you may

have left me sorry get up here you

teleport yourself there you go

okay then retcon I tell waffles to

protect Simon yeah okay so okay so I

literally show up I yell at the guy

killing deer to stop

I'm just like I'm an I tried everything

okay dear what do you do well this

assassin does not seem deterred at all

strange is this a hut still there no

damn it

alright disappeared as soon as paltin

left it alright alright I'll use my my

cunning action to I'll pop home shows up

and just blows it I was telling like you

know their blades they're using poison

and then it's due to a haphazard swing

at the lady who hit me okay

oh that's a good swing 27 oh yes

you cut through her silken robes into

flesh wait

how close was palton let's say 10 feet

fine

alright normal weapon damage then yep

alright alright some of her blood

trickles down on to the ground she is

not happy about that and so she's going

to stab at you twice man these dice are

on fire I borrow these good okay cool

great awesome so yeah yeah you're gonna

be hit twice great cool

the first one is six piercing damage

I'll dodge that one okay three the

second one will be five piercing damage

alright and then I need you to make two

saving throws alright okay that's a

thirteen and a three okay you gained two

more levels of exhaustion

you're now on disadvantage on everything

attack role saving throws and ability

checks your hit point maximum is for the

time being halved so what is your

maximum hit points 54 so it is now 27

which means if you have more than 27 hit

points you currently have 27 hit points

got it okay okay all right

his her friend will take another shot

with a bolt oh man you're hit again

seven points of damage and I need you to

make a third saving throw remember

you're at disadvantage so roll twice all

right well first rolls okay

second b20 roll six all right your speed

is now zero okay so you palton you cdf

just kind of like fall like all his

bones just melted onto the ground i just

sort of falls back on his butt and can

barely keep himself up he looks very

very close to death very like dude it's

like this is coming from the drunk but

get it together dude all right and then

it is Strix astern Strix you fly your

broom you come up over the market where

people scores of people running away you

see in the middle of the market there is

an owl bear with a basket stuck on her

head

how'd she get like that already there

was a basket full of fish so she just

stuck your head in and starting the

basket got stuck on her head so now

she's like one of those cat videos where

the cat can't get it

I mean and she's looking around for

Simon with the basket on her head and

I'm one more failed Constitution saving

throw from death I'm well I'm upset

straight that do I see everyone else on

the roof you can see DF lying down with

an assassin looming above him and paltin

standing nearby looking confused like he

just tried to verbally tell them hey

stop you've got steps yet funk block now

from your from your unique point of view

Strix I'm gonna have you make a

perception check to see if you notice

anything else but we just got here Jared

you can't die that quickly please okay

you can see in addition to the two

assassins on the roof that there are

some assassins climbing up the walls in

the alleyway two more this place is

stupid

two more assassins coming up the walls

and you can see in the alley what

appears to be one of these assassins on

the back of a dinosaur oh great

take it for our own the assassin on the

dinosaur looks like a child it's a small

figure so here it's halfling perhaps no

is it a monkey no no but it's got a

monkey on its shoulder I knew I knew it

it is a it is a halfling assassin on the

back of an Allosaurus mount with a

monkey familiar or companion alright um

I would like to misty step between the

assassin and DF okay from my broom I

know and I also I before I do that I

tell my broom to attack the other

assassin okay your broom goes racing off

to attack the other one what I do when

you so that was a bonus action to miss

yes you are now standing over DF yeah

and I'm going to polymorph the one right

in front of me alright I've got to make

a saving throw

what do you attempting to polymorph into

what type of chicken should we do this

time maybe like a cute little baby chick

like a little a little yellow fuzzy one

and what's the saving through a DC 16

alright the assassin resists your spell

damn it I can't use my inspiration to

alter their role can I know

I tried bub well I'm in front of it so

come at me okay make a couple attacks

with your broom or old d28 4 okay roll

z/28 yeah six misses 18 okay that hit

the assassins a rola d4 +2 take that

you're gonna get flapped flap right in

the face 5 okay

yes your broom that's some significant

damage to this assassin he wasn't

expecting to get whacked out of the air

okay and that's tricks astern evylyn I

can I reach this bias okay as soon as I

see him collapse knowing what I know

about this whole death situation I just

make a beeline for him and I'm warming

up my hands as I go like a like a IDI

like clear like lay on hands and I I can

spend five lay on hands points to cure

poison but I guess I don't know that

he's poison do I you as soon as you see

him wounds that are sort of discolored

and yeah you can go okay he's been

poisoned

so I all lay on five for the poison and

like 20 more for well-being so just like

full-on like who wouldn't like his body

are just laugh you know like yeah like

an emergency like accidentally knock me

over and I was like yeah when the poison

effect is lifted D F so to do the so

goes the effects of the exhaustion oh

good all of it yep huh

evylyn okay so then you said you also

restored some hit points on top of that

yeah 23 okay all right I'm alive again

haha how do you react to being a shot up

to like the stench of strikes in front

of you're just not I'm like being like

I'd like the pure anger face like just

slowly rise up but then I just wipe the

drool off your welcome paltin yes okay

so how far is the assassin actually I

guess that doesn't how far our two

assassins from each other like who are

the two closest the two closest would be

the two on the roof one is 10 feet away

from you and the other is now 40 feet

away from you and they cool the other

ones being whacked by a broom okay

then I'm going to try and cast crown a

madness on the closer one okay and do

you know your saved DC 15 I believe all

right

the assassin resists cool

just as she shook off the poly more

spell so - does she does does she shake

off the crown of madness no but you can

see she's quite annoyed with how events

have transpired DF what do you know how

close is she to me oh she's right there

now Strix is kind of between you but

you're still within 5 feet of her all

right you have an ally in basically

basically yeah okay yeah so as she is

distracted and R is trying to resist the

poly more

and I basically like dive roll pass

tricks in her okay and as I'm rolling up

and I stand up behind her just like a

turnaround like backslash all right

right across her back okay I'll stand

the desk

oh 26 oh yeah that hits all right good

and gutter drinks this day which I got

all my days so much okay okay

sounded like a lot of things it's all

the G sexes item 35 oh my gosh all right

uh she suffers a crippling wound she is

now bloodied and in great great pain oh

it's still standing still standing gosh

quite quite hurt yes now it's gonna be a

little more dramatic but all right and

gutters like well done she goes next oh

she is from under unfurling from

underneath her robe but you can see she

pulls actually pulls back the sleeve of

one of her robes and there is a black

snake coiled around it it uncoils

unfurls its wings and flies off using

the disengage action to avoid attacks of

opportunity Ross oh dealing with yeah

she will then turn around again DF and

actually strix looks like the softer

target she will turn her poison two

blade on you strike

don't hurt my friend I'm not soft her

lowest roll is a 19 so yeah that place

you take five piercing damage from one

stab already have a better chance at

resisting boys in the night it's four

from the other so a total of nine and I

need to saving throws alright

constitutionally saving throws first one

is fourteen second one is thirteen okay

that's two fails yeah so in addition to

being poisoned which affects your attack

rolls and ability checks you have two

levels of exhaustion so not only do you

have disadvantage on attack rolls and

ability checks but your speed is haft

alright alright and I'm like I'm not

soft the one on the roof fighting the

broom is going to he's because I really

got a good weapon to attack the broom so

he is actually cool boy being annoyed

and they're indicative the face yeah

seeing his imperiled companion he will

stand there and suffer the abuse and

lord load his crossbow and attempt to

shoot at DF da okay he shoots you in the

back for for piercing damage all right

okay - and the saving throw Constitution

alright I got it this time

Oh sixteen all right that's resistant no

problem there I sliced the bark duh duh

the bolt out of my back to more dark

clad sent assassins come up onto the

roof having climbed up out of the alley

they pulled themselves up under the roof

and that's the end of their turn

so now many dudes there are now three on

your rooftop oh yeah we keep making

forgot about those right all right

Strix

all right I'm upset I'll just like shoot

a panicked look at a vlinn um so how

many people how many bad people are now

on the roof it's so on your roof there's

the one that you've been fighting the

female assassin who is between you and

DF currently the two that just came up

on the roof you see one is male one is

female as soon as they climb up

basically all they're able to do on the

end of their turn is pull out scimitars

okay each in synchrony chronicity start

to hate this speed up all around no

reason to show off I am going to cast

fireball careful spell raining on the

roof right here on the roof all right

from okay yeah so we're on the other

side of torn I'm sorry I just drop it

right like some other side of port nines

are one of the merchant princes is

waking up and looking out over the vista

of the city and then this big oh yeah it

also like to cast it at level 4 level 5

okay 96 great all right it's it's 86 for

a third level 96 for 4th level 10 d600

no so 3 of the assassins 3 of the

assassins including the one between you

and DF get engulfed in the flames

the flames wrap around you DF and

paulten and evylyn 39 all right okay the

bad news would like plays with the fired

pokes it as it's like like around so

that's the bad news is all of the

assassins made their saves but the good

news is that the two with the scimitars

as they're flashing them around doing

that are just completely incinerated

[Laughter]

clatter clatter clatter clatter clang

the one that's between you and Diego

often fire and most of her robes and

stuff just burn away and she's screaming

because her skin is all blackened and

scorched but somehow she is still alive

clinging to life she tried to basically

the world out of it but couldn't get out

of the danger in time oh and do I get to

do damage my broom against you do you

get to make two attacks on that guy so

roll the fire around them well that was

a four-person one misses okay just like

drunken broom all right yeah evylyn the

fireball evaporates smoke is now rising

from various things including piles of

ash where people yeah there is only one

assassin on the roof now and she is

badly hurt and not terribly far away

from you probably about five feet away

from you there's also the one on the

other roof who's being accosted by the

broom hmm I guess I go for the one

that's still on this roof okay I look

for quick confirmation from da Thor I'm

like ah kill Luca was killed yeah this

is a kill situation may you be joined

with the light of the morning Lord no no

I just chopper with tree bein right I

haven't wielded my little my little axe

in a little while yeah that's the one

yeah evil uns been feeling like she

needs a little choppy choppy action that

wasn't very good that was a 13 she

dodges out of the way of that narrowly

evens like with frustration because she

hasn't used her axe in a while so she

feels out of practice so she goes for it

again and that is worse oh dear okay

Poulter is quite ashamed yeah it's all

on you buddy one assassin

left she's badly hurt evylyn just

whiffed so there's one assassin and

they're looking like messed up yeah on

the roof with you guys I already blooded

her with a back slash the other

assassins still off on the other roof

being accosted by a quick question have

we did we establish why we're being

assassinated already no cool would be a

good idea

so I'm gonna I'm gonna go up to the

really the really effed up one yeah and

I'm going to try another persuasion I'm

gonna be like let's try this one more

time

stand down answer our questions and

maybe your life is spared alright make a

persuasion check I'm gonna give you

advantage on the job current predicament

he weren't maybe alright that would be

18 you are successful and she casts her

blade and her crossbow down onto the

roof and away from her and is currently

or apparently unarmed cool alright who's

got questions I do same and let's see

oh yeah what happened to the dinosaur

they were writing we didn't keep that

one didn't even come up yeah yeah which

I'm fine with

right now feel like there's a good

excuse to steal someone's dinosaur they

tried to assassinate us you're not wrong

but they they're a lot of work they eat

it a lot I'll take care of it I promise

[Laughter]

don't believe that Strix is out like

shoveling the Pope it's just like I

really made me I knew it it's all right

as you watch a fist the size of like a

storm Giants fist uh-huh but made

entirely of ice materializes next to the

assassin being accosted by Strix is

broom and then tries to punch that

assassin cool I know that magic all

right and this ice this giant ice fist

slams into and wounds the the assassin

being accosted by the broom and kind of

knocks him for a loop and DF yeah what

do you do all right

assassin in front of Me's she's a real

live and alive okay she the one I got

punched or the other one the other one

good the one in front of me who dropped

her weapons I am going to take them

mm-hmm and then fire the crossbow at the

other one okay you pick up the crossbow

and yeah excellent make an attack Rome

using your race

17 you're gonna hit so it'll do a d6

plus your dexterity mod now question

that broom was in melee engagement with

that target yes that allowed the sneak

attack

yeah good have to do a Constitution

saving thrill Chris Perkins because

there's so she's gonna have to resist

this poison like she's gonna suffer one

level of exhaustion okay assault my only

evil is being turned against me I I just

lost it all right 3232 oh my god yeah

okay so that is a serious wound that one

is definitely in the land of the

bloodied now and failed it's saving

throne versus the poison so are you

working with brooms instead of against

him all right so you see the the fatigue

and trauma set in as the as the bolt

Pierce's his flesh it's a nice being

accosted by a broom crossbows and a big

giant iceberg yeah as well as things

like the crossbows alright the assassin

who surrendered herself huh she's not

doing anything this round the one who

just got shot and who got punched by the

ice fist and he's going to disengage he

is going to withdraw and run away and he

sort of hurls himself off of the rooftop

and out of your view wait to my broom

get an attack of opportunity or my broom

just like shakes its face yeah the fist

shakes its fist

as that assassin vacates because he's

not gonna stick around he's badly badly

hurt alright so you have kind of

dispensed with all of your adversaries

at this point so but I'm gonna stay an

initiative just in case you want to do

something or follow up this would be

Steven everyone wants to check on

waffles and also see if the dinosaurs

down there crystal poisoned

another like on fire like you did so

usually so self-sufficient you know just

like okay can even like she's like she

walks over to Strix and she's like you

know patting her with one hand carrying

the poison but she's actually just kind

of looking for womble right yeah yeah

yeah yeah cure the poison

oh yeah you can see waffles are still

out in the square kind of ambling about

with the basket on its head you think

that she's either figured out a way to

kind of see through the holes in the

basket and there's not like colliding

into anything but right now she is she's

given up on trying to get it off or so

so I unpause and you though I laid on

here so your poison is gone usually

yours using five points Anna yeah okay

unless you need more do you need more no

I think that's it and I am good I don't

stand up any straighter

that's just it didn't really change at

all alright do I see Simon like is there

anything else I see do I see the

dinosaurs yeah when you look down the

alley and then sort of to your right to

the end of the alley you can see that

Simon is with a dark clad assassin

stranger danger and they are standing

next to the halfling assassin who's

riding the dinosaur with the monkey on

his shoulder and I I just do it Aladdin

off the roof like step off a true with

my boots all right yeah so you can race

toward them and get to them pretty much

on your turn in your turn will be done

at that point okay dinosaur with them

I'm very concerned about the show

the happening the black-clad halfling

think of a house riding wearing a turban

wearing a black turban with a black veil

covering his mouth and a black robe on

the back of a blue painted Allosaurus

which looks like a Velociraptor

basically it's a racing dinosaur

yeah it looks like a racing dinosaur and

he's on the back and he's holding the

reins like that and he's got a little

monkey on his shoulder when the monkeys

got a fez I'm gonna have to confiscate

both of those and next to him is the

assassin who's got Simon by the the arm

and he's actually I'm in resisting like

is he trying to pull away

no and the assassins actually got also a

hand over Simon's mouth like a gloved

hand over Simon's mouth do not touch our

son that way probably cuz Simon tried to

like dark him we could hurt him in the

hand didn't we did we load him back up

with poisoned darts didn't we think you

think well you you think that he he's

basically giving his kids not close and

so he's just sort of timing is just

standing there is a little docile

hostage not putting up any fight of any

kind and most don't worry mom I'll save

you yeah so they're just standing there

and the halfling will say to you please

ma'am we don't want to conflict yeah I

don't either so give me back my son and

stop trying to kill my family

oh we will attend to your son to your

man no problem there but we want

something in exchange

no you don't get to make me buy back my

son that's ludicrous in the Holy Name of

levander I have never heard something so

ridiculous

he says you took something that belonged

to us ma'am we want it back

what magic ring if you please I have no

magic ring do I look like I wear rings

your friend who companies you the artist

Simba

the ring that's not my friend he took it

from us he is with you could we talk to

someone else we're just all watching

this go to hell just like are we still

an initiative let's say no so you guys

can pretty much do anything you want to

let this know you can all hear evil and

grab Simon paltin what did you want to

do so I'm still on the roof with the

assassin that's yeah okay cool yep okay

so I'm gonna I'm gonna keep umm can I

like tie our hands so they don't try

anything

sure thing you shirk' without rope we

just thought yeah buy some today alright

so um yes you cut off like five feet of

MU you bind her wrists good and tight do

I see like do I see everything with evil

and now when you after you've tied her

off and you just sort of look down the

alleyway you can see evil and as in a

heated exchange with the halfling on the

dinosaur with the monkey companion in

the simon's there and you know

everything yeah okay and I can infer

that the assassin is with them right so

there is a there's an assassin holding

Simon and there's the black cloud

half-length who might also be an

assassin on the back of the dinosaur

along I mean the one I have tied up I

can like gather that there share the

same part same crew yeah I'm gonna like

walk I'm gonna like walk her over to the

edge of the roof uh-huh it's gonna be

like

hey so before I start bartering like are

you just gonna say you don't care if she

dies it would be an acceptable Lhasa to

get the ring back the ring the ring of

winter it was taken from us sir is that

the ring that makes the iceberg she's

trying to take that's not gonna work

because I want that but it belongs to us

sir

it was stolen from us he really is very

polite

you got like receipts or something no

sir no just to double-check if I

threatened to kill her you that is that

enough to give us our son but a little

robot boy back I will be very sad sir

but I must have the ring there's a

looming Harry well so much for

collateral all right guys I try to thing

y'all go at that point in time palton

I'd like you to make an insight check

okay ooh that is a powerful powerful

that twice in one episode now yeah

there's been a couple so you don't

notice anything or any any anything that

would would help you in this situation

dia and Strix what are you doing at the

present time I I'm like gestured for my

broom like yeah the broom will come over

to your head just like a cool yeah like

Harry Potter ask like Quidditch move and

I'm gonna go down and take the basket

off waffles head oh sure is it evil and

forgot I had pressing concerns

alright I was gonna take that off what

I'm just gonna I guess just be like

hover with waffles over to where Evelyn

is while she's just yelling hey I'm just

gonna like walk over there thanks for

that Elin impression straight

commander so during this battle we saw

this magic hand show up and punch the

other one right yeah all right I'm

trusting evil and in paltin to do some

expert stall tactics right now as they

are wanted to do and I'm going to go to

like sky the opposite side of the roof

and basically or keep an eye out and

start looking for artists all right just

make a perception check also side note

after I established that she's not

really used for bartering I just look at

her I'm like so how you doing

she's all burnt her flesh is all charred

and she's like doing okay you know I'm

just trying to have a nice chat but you

try to make friends that's all

all right exception 24 all right you do

spot him and then okay you can see that

off to one side of the the market there

is this structure this with this stucco

building and it's got a minaret that

comes out of the top of it he's actually

at the top of the minaret about 60 feet

off the ground he's basically up in a

thin Tower gotcha all right

looking down positing so you can see

he's about a hundred and twenty feet

away from his fist yeah is it possible

for me to get to him without the

assassins knowing where I'm going or

seeing me yes but it would take you a

while if you were basically running

across the ground and then had to

basically go up the inside of the

minaret unless you can fly or somehow

get to the top quickly I can be

acrobatic and cutting action - that

won't get you to the top of the minaret

all right I'll start kind of just

imagine artist sees me yeah you you

imagine correctly all right yeah so

while those the rest of them are kind of

distracting them I kind of signal to

artists to kind of meet me halfway and

kind of point to somewhere okay I'm just

gonna start going from rooftop to

rooftop

okay artists will basically fly down on

the back of his ice vulture and land at

the basically at the point where you to

meet out of sight of the assassins right

so then like face-to-face like yapping

voices down so they don't know where

they are artists who are they

there this entire we will then I they

want the ring clearly they say you took

it from them is that true yes but they

took it from me first do I believe him

can I get that same check you do believe

him you think that there's a long story

there that he doesn't want to get into

right okay then all that I'll say right

it should they retrieves a ringer winter

once more how bad would that be well

they're not going to because I'm not

giving it to them

putting me in a pickle artists they

sincerely believe you about this object

and its importance something more

important to my friends who's in danger

he says I've told you about the power of

this ring and it's evil influence on

people it can't be allowed to fall into

enemy hands again I agree so then what

are you gonna do he says I will help you

deal with these assassins do you think

we could take them on I don't know I

have a few tricks I'm sure you do as

well

getting spared Eclair rings on you

decoy rings just normal rings fake ones

maybe once I could possibly pass with

maybe a little light blue in color he

will take the glove off his hand so you

can see the ring of winter now on his

finger and he will concentrate and you

see forming in his palm is a ring made

of blue ice apparently he can use the

rain to create ice objects as well as

ice creatures this is perfect all right

I'm going to take it from him okay it's

actually glacial ice so it's cold and

made of real ice okay I got my gloves

yeah but it's fine I mean like brittlely

Oh Oh like go bike back and forth on

YouTube it gets too cold on one a little

son boy yeah it's more a case where you

know it will start to melt in this heat

after a fashion so time is of the

essence yeah I'm like felt like kind of

keep it covered okay I'll tell artists

to basically get somewhere where you can

see everything and act should you see

the occasion arise I'm going to try to

get rid of them and bias

I'm just rid of them hopefully there's

none the wiser will do all right with

that I like - right back cross the

rooftops - basically the point where I

was before and then kind of use my

second-story work to kind of go back

down the building you know hop down to a

window ledge and then like kind of slide

across the wall down below and then walk

up to the rest of the party okay when I

made you're still bickering back and

forth during all of this yes in fact

while the earth has been off let's see

paltin already rolled it for inside have

evylyn and Strix do the same inside

check wisdom guy try something once they

do that you sure can sweet I got a 6 I

don't know what's going on I'm picking

fish bones out of waffles for 16 okay

evylyn you're able to tell that the thug

who's basically got simon he's not that

he's not the boss the halfling on the

dinosaur is the boss but that thug is

deeply troubled by something and has his

eyes sort of dart back and forth you

think he's got some sort of connection

to a relationship to the female assassin

that paltin has he seems very nervous

isn't it horrible to feel the feeling of

knowing you might just lose someone that

you love for no reason other than some

dinosaur riding turban wearing halfling

scum leader I feel that woe upon me as I

look upon my son I wonder if anyone in

the whole world might feel the same as

me right now that role of persuasion

Texas feel yes you can and in the

meantime palton what would you like to

do well first I'd like to see how that

persuasion 28 I am I am making him cry

real tears like I hear that and like I

start tearing the love of family oh no

really there's a fishbone in my I gotta

get it out alright and as you do that

yeah you see that he turns to the

halfling and says i do not see the ring

perhaps we shouldn't just get out of

here before the the authorities show up

my innocent son

we can always try again later and the

halfling just turns to him and says be

quiet do not speak also they already

tried to kill us so it's kind of seems

fair that we would just go ahead yeah

and that guy that guy who was sort of

holding Simon he sort of lets go of the

one hand you can see he's sort of

putting his hand down on his scimitar so

do so did I

was I able to kind of see that the thug

holding Simon isn't actually like

calling the shots from that yeah okay

cool I'm gonna I'm gonna call out to the

other guy the guy who I'm inferring is

like kind of in control this whole

situation behalf like on the Dinosauria

yeah halfling like hey buddy question um

so in about two minutes do you want like

all of your guts to be like splattered

all over the place no sir okay because

that little robot you're holding is set

to is actually an explosive and he's set

to go off within a few minutes and I'm

the only one who can disable it if you

want give them to me I can stop that or

you know I'm out of range of it it's up

to you and I want to try and deceive him

if I can please do deception that's 23

okay he yes and you see instinctively

the guy holding on to Simon just lets

him go at that me and the halfling is

like please do not let it explode can do

would I be able to like I don't I don't

think dimension door works that way but

can I open it so Simon could just walk

through and then just door up to me or

it's only you okay um it's gonna be like

all right Simon come on make it snappy

let's go and the halfling turns the guy

who let him go and he says don't let him

go you fool

kaitlin can even when he lets go of him

just make a dash to try to like snatch

him in her feet okay yeah in fact

there's really well the only attack

you'll provoke is potentially from the

dinosaur so I can take it

alright oh wait actually once so once I

see that there that Simon is free I can

turn around and cast a darkness on them

as well like over the dinosaur alright

so what do I roll to make that dashing

grab well I'm gonna have you and Strix

just make a quick initiative check for

me to see what goes off first you oops

thanks I got 12 okay so the Darwin is no

8 sorry the darkness lands everything

goes dark in a 20-foot radius sphere so

evil and you've got a snatch Simon in

complete and utter darkness so I'm gonna

have you make an attack roll against

sorry we make a roll 2d 20 take the

lower result and add your attack bonus

your melee 11 okay you succeed yeah and

you snatch him up out of the darkness

and fly him up to paltin I'm just

holding him like like a like a really

big doll yeah

the darkness would actually answer like

over here yeah thank you the darkness

would envelop paltin as well so should I

roll to be able to find him you kind of

know where he is okay my heart leads me

okay I'd also like to yell time to rise

do you see the darkness appear oh and

you would like flies yeah out with Simon

all right I'm gonna take that that ring

and basically put it to like a spear

pouch and get tired up all right

and then I feel like these are kind of a

public menace I think we probably should

take their dinosaurs yeah if you see the

halfling on the dinosaur just bolt out

of the darkness coming

down the alley I'm trying to get out of

the darkness as quickly as possible and

away from what he perceives to be an

exploding puppet so like straight for

like away from straight toward you all

right but more interested in getting

away than anything all right

I'll basically get down at the rooftop

yeah and just wait for them to kind of

pass this guy leave on their own the the

halfling with the dinosaur and the

monkey seems to be leaving on his own

and actually he he does to stop and turn

and frown when he realized he's probably

been duped Mosel monkeys just like i

told you man and then he shakes his fist

at the darkness and says i'll get that

ring all right so are we like running at

this point yeah at this point I guess

you're just out of what are you gonna do

anything with the the bound prisoner

that you have on the rooftop um it's I'm

gonna go for unless you had she was

until all her hair and flesh burned off

I mean literally she was

temperature-wise very hot okay so before

we go like I'm holding her I just hold

her in front me I'm just like I'm sorry

things had to be this way but until we

meet again and I like almost going for a

kiss I'm like okay bye I just like -

okay all right you run off you never

passes up an opportunity okay so you

have all fled the scene leaving darkness

behind and some confused assassins good

and you are out of danger what happened

to your donkey that you rented it still

like standing where it was by the barrel

with all your stuff in front of them so

he's got doesn't need to go anywhere yep

the Market Square the the red bazaar is

pretty quiet a few people are starting

to filter back in

start to clean up the mess all right

well then after I know like all of them

are very gone and like they don't like

sense danger for them returning or

finding us then Allah I kind of

reconvene with the crew and my donkey

and equipment are we not gonna follow

them we're just gonna let them go yes

they'd have to kill us and try to steal

our Sun and then bailed that's the point

it's better to let them go and know that

we're really capable and tell their

friends okay Babel we are and then they

won't come back I really want them to

hurt someone else artists will land his

ice vulture cool and dismount and just

sort of leave it there with its wings

folded and he says this is a bad omen

doesn't harm know that I'm here they're

going to send others to come after me I

no longer feel like I can safely guide

you I agree in fact they'll probably

come after us with more I think they're

it where can you go he says I can find

many places to hide in this land I know

Scheldt well but I don't want to leave

you without someone I'm going to bring

someone by someone I trust to serve as a

guide in my place he will meet you at

kaya's house of repose well in the

meantime and I go to pet the iceberg

yeah you see the iceberg is perfectly

still like a statue it doesn't move or

not a muscle not nothing and in fact you

can see Paulding as you touch it it's

kind of runny like it's starting to melt

I'm just like one day you'll be mine

but artist says I am comforted to have

at least seen them now I know who some

of them are I can maybe get to them

before they get to me right well we did

what we could for you

and we appreciate your help in return

all right Emma

a little one of her little like trinkets

her little pipe okay that does little

skulls and feel like maybe this will

cheer you up while you're in the jungle

thanks for your help he'll take it and

he'll say an hour before midnight

my friend will come by you may be jarred

by his appearance but he is absolutely

trustworthy and as a good soul I say to

him say hey man

before you go you uh you can't have the

ring I'm going persuade him and go I can

happen all the persuasion checks in the

world are not going to convince artists

again wait no assignment with me yes

safety @df give him that ribbon oh she

doesn't know he has it

damn it I feel like to give them the

fake on so he'd be happy that would be

good it's like I'll get that ring it's

not today but I'll get that ring all

right artists will walk away and leave

the iceberg ice bird there just to kind

of melt away over time yeah yeah I got

the last word in that counts for

something you did all right don't put

your name in that bird when eleven

o'clock rolls around and you're sitting

in kaya's house you've got all your gear

and your back and just gonna rest up for

the night after what is a trying ordeal

Oh real quick Chris I wanted to say when

I was purchasing supplies

up just in the in the interim I also

wanted to make sure I got stuff to make

maps with oh yeah the cartographers kit

yeah / - ink quill etc that's a I think

a little bit more expensive just let me

look that up okay so another important

question where my PI's okay PI's are

great ok Kalyn up just fine

so cartographers tools are 15 gold

alright and then after this engagement I

can't want to make it a point to see if

any where cells say antidotes or

antitoxins or any kind of anti poison

things yeah if you want a vial of

antitoxin costs fifty gold I am a vial

of antitoxin what do you need that for

that's dry happens if you're not around

or unconscious I will get one okay

that's 50 gold alright that's a lot of

gold it is alright and then after like

artist walks away

d/f like opens up his pouch the head

back the fake wringing it I ports it on

his hand and then crushes it and like

looks at the rest of the party and it

actually says you guys handle that

session situation really well I'm really

proud of all of you Oh shucks miss lady

claw thanks buddy

remember how you like also almost died

that was something huh yeah I remember

try not to stress yeah so it's a

relatively speaking after the after

today's adventures the night seems to

pass pretty peacefully and then an hour

before midnight a figure walks in that

looks like that trying to see it as hard

as I like it looks like a saw and

humanoid with us it looks like a

humanoid with saurian or reptilian

features dinosaur man and he's got a

very simple cloak kind of draped over

his shoulders and when he walks in and

looks around there's a sort of very

strange odor that accompanies him and he

seems very trepidatious as he pokes his

head in and

he smells like cooked ham

I'm immediately just like kale sorry

ill sir what he means is pleased to make

your acquaintance new friend thank you

for coming to visit us you must be a

friend of artists he nods doesn't say a

word up to this point but then and the

three of you - evil and notice that the

scent changes it's no longer you know

there smells like ham he smells like

lemon I could be wrong but I believe

that I'm getting a waft of citrus is

that a perfume of yours or it's very

nice so you know artist wasn't kidding

you're really weird yeah you can see

he's nice he's got a big sword and he's

got sheathed to his side it's a long

sword but it's it's got sort of rawhide

wrapped around its hilt and it kind of

catches the light in a interesting and

weird way and then he looks around and

basically sits down in a chair and just

sits there

oh no chats chats pointing out can be

evil and smell no ha ha never mind she

doesn't notice that at all everybody

else does and you can see he just kind

of sits there and makes himself

comfortable like he's just gonna pass

the time sitting here right and do you

guys eventually feel sleepy well what's

your name silent person

well it's Erdman he he seems to

acknowledge you but does not speak at

all alright we're gonna go with John

lizard strikes will hand him a coil in a

parchment so that he can write it down

okay he will write out the name drag

bate oh that's that's bad hey what's a

literal literal or figurative whatever

starts will just like give him like a

hello and say dragon bait that's his

that's his name you know it's I like

lizard men I think we're gonna go with

lizard oh nice to meet you dragon bait

you smell very nice death we'll just at

this point artist says you know the way

to or illunga you thinks about it he

thinks oh boy

cool well well enough and then you his

smell changes from lemon to brimstone oh

I know that one why are all you guys

reacting like this out of nowhere what

are you guys like telepathically getting

some messages cuz I'm not getting

anything

evylyn Strix will like stick her arm I

heard you like smell me do you smell me

I mean I can remember how you smell but

well that's not the same thing so then

this guy smells so just go well that's

not very nice to say talk to juniper or

something otherwise you're gonna get sad

and then he goes up it gets up out of

his chair he walks outside me stands in

the street and he just sort of puts his

sword point down in the ground and just

sort of stands there almost like he's

meditating his head up looking up toward

the stars are you praying to laugh and

ER I'm going kneel down next to me I

also love to pray to lavander in the

evening isn't it beautiful to look at

the stars and just imagine the light of

the morning Lord shining down upon us

from there his smell changes although

she doesn't know this to be baked bread

I just feel so come on it's so nice to

have companionship while I pray morning

Lord

I'm drawn to the scent of the bread I'm

like food oh my voice is gonna go check

on her pies the pies are still there and

you have your rope to tie everybody

together like you did last night

perfect so that house can't spirit you

away in the night I'll go to dragon bait

as he's doing his beard meditative state

only assuming that he can't even hear me

he can hear you he acknowledged okay but

he's just sort of giving you a side eye

alright I'll inform I'll even spring

yeah I'll inform him of our original

plan about how artist was going to lead

us down the rivers of the jungle through

canoes and that's how we're going to get

to or alonga that word he has got an

idea or even started thinking about how

we would possibly get there and then

also let him know that we're gonna leave

first thing in the morning so should he

need any rest he's situated at

tonight he will nod and you see that his

his smell changes to the smell of lemon

again and then he leaves evylyn in the

street back into a chair in the main

common room and just kind of plops down

rest his sword somewhere near close by

within easy reach of his hand and then

just kind of knobs off alright I'm gonna

I'm gonna walk up to DF I'm good hey

yeah it word over here really quick I

think okay so assessing the situation I

know we're not the most tactful Bunch I

know we're not really great with secrets

but we kind of don't really know if this

is the guy we kind of just spilled all

of our plans to the first weird-looking

dude that we stopped being consider

maybe we should let him talk before we

like I don't know give them our socials

or anything like that like I don't know

if we're really open with strangers I

don't think you can talk I think that's

all he's got it's like okay so what

would swell house how does that confirm

that this is the guy no I mean you're

right that was careless but he was here

at the proper meeting time an artist did

say to be prepared for his appearance so

I just never seen anything like this

excuse me anyone that's I don't need so

rude Wow

I didn't mean look you know what I'm

trying to say okay look all I'm saying

it is that this isn't the guy that's

gonna be really embarrassing and just

food for thought you're right even stole

the street and please protect my friends

oh my god

and our new friend dragon Bay waffles

will sort of who'd you to get you out of

that state so you'd come over and like

your pets and things Oh better yeah get

her all situated for the night all right

as the night comes upon you and you

retire to strix his bedchamber where she

ties ropes around all of you again and

put eyes on their favorite spies near

your heads it takes a really long time

to fall asleep so I'm just like yeah I

mean I understand that maybe you just

didn't feel like making me a pie because

I can make you a pie I fall I fall

asleep with no problem just like sweet

dreamland take me away yes and Simon

will be just sort of lying next to you

rigid don't lie you're sort of past one

arm over him protectively and fall

asleep Simon my son if things get weird

turn away yeah this head will just turn

completely around into the pillow all

right and then when you finally all nod

off the F the last to go

spectral hags return to your room for

another hot date and you see the one of

them that crawls on top of you DF has

got a bag over her head like a stitched

leather bag makes it better it's got

sort of a hole in the front of it and

it's kind of dark within that hole but

then a chicken head comes out of the

hole and looks around and then withdraws

and then a snake head comes out and also

looks around and as she climbs on top of

you in her

of spectral ethereal form you can't feel

her and you're kind of dreaming this so

you're not actually you you sort of

dream the caress feeling that she has as

her as her hands and claws brush over

you and she takes a fingernail and just

sort of brushes are sort of scratches it

around your mouth and then your just

uses that finger to hook your mouth and

pull it open and then she takes what

looks like a pillowcase a black

pillowcase and starts shoving it down

your throat yes

and each the other the other hags do

similar things to paltin and Strix they

force open their mouths and stuff black

what looks like a black sack down your

throats and as you're sleeping you just

start to gag and evylyn you are awakened

by the sound of the three of them just

gagging and that's where we'll stop for

tonight we'll get to the pies next week
