[Music]

that's a tweet ding what to go live well

we're about to go live in fact you're

probably live hi everybody welcome to

dice camera action yeah show about the

waffle crew and friends I'm friend yep

and I'd like to welcome Rachel into our

group for today and we'll be introducing

her character shortly but when we last

left the waffle crew you had just well

you I used the term lightly and scared

off the big red dragon Klaus who took a

considerable amount of damage last week

from a variety of sources

warning his bid to steal the ring of

winter but when all seemed like it might

work out a group of frost giants showed

up we oriented the whole world and these

frost giants three of them came to

challenge the dragon for the ring and

when all was said and done the leader of

the frost giants this hulking female

frost giant s now managed to get to the

ring in her clutches

palton had managed to keep the ring on

the move by putting it on the hand of

his severed crawling claw and had it

basically running around the battlefield

all of last week being at it was a

really good plan and it worked out

really well the frost giant now houses

in his clutches but paltin appeared

right at her feet right behind her

actually at the end of last week's

session she doesn't even know he's there

yet and a fireball just went off in the

general vicinity so everything around

her and paltin is kind of fuming and

billowing smoke at the moment the rest

of the waffle crew realizing that palton

had abandoned them to get his ring back

have now abandoned their plan to head

deeper into the ruined Palace of omou

and are rushing back out to help

so since we haven't technically dropped

out of initiative it is now oh and bag

of nails is gone he took the

acquisitions Inc airship and flew away

so long respects yes fun yes yes yes so

let us start with halting oh I would

like you to make a perception check oh

to start off this game okay

you see that everything not only is the

giantess so distracted by the fact that

she has your hand and it's ring in her

clutches at last after what must be an

absolutely hellish journey for her from

the frigid frozen seas of the north all

the way down to the humid hot searing

hellish jungles of Kult thousands upon

thousands of sailing miles for her

crossing through jungles which must have

just been a hell and of itself

finally her quest is at an end she has

the device that she wants what she has

failed to notice and what you have

noticed is that coming out of the burnt

jungle all around her kind of enclosing

her in a ring are more of these small

little vegetable people that you saw

jumping on the dragon and fighting the

dragon they know no one of them stands

more than about three feet tall and it

just looks like a bipedal massive

vegetable matter with a little sort of

top knot and little yellow beady eyes

sticking out those husky corn husk head

and they're all clutching Spears and

they're sort of narrowing the circle

around her and you they don't seem to

threaten you they seem to be threatening

toward her

cool what would you like to do I'm going

- I'm gonna go invisible okay and what

can i what do I have left turning

invisible is an action for you so you

have movies your movement left and a

bonus action if you want to use that

like your I believe your inspiration

bonus action action I can ever remember

[Music]

[Applause]

force action yeah so you could do

something like that in addition to your

movement okay I'm going to could I try

and get the ring back at this point or

does it look like it's it's too hard to

get to it's too hard because she's

basically got in her big honkin giant

fist or blue fist your hand with the

ring on its finger so you can't even see

the ring right now it's just sort of in

her fist okay then I guess I'll do my

Bartok inspiration it occurs to me we

last week you asked a question can you

trigger the ring remotely because it's

on your hand it's on your severed hand

yes and I said yes

and I think it still has a charge is it

not it does okay is that is that a bonus

action or inaction actually it would be

an action unless you okay yeah so you

can't really do much with that never

right that's fine then I'm gonna as my

bonus action I'll just give these little

veggie guys some inspiration okay if I

can just be like you know I go get them

yes all right when do you do that and

you offer some inspiring words and

encouragement to these little creatures

you can target one of them specifically

to gain the benefits of your Bartok

inspiration if you want and you do

notice that one of them is a little bit

too

than the others and he's got a he's

wearing a boot on his head does this

boot strike me as yeah that guy's

probably important it you think you

think maybe among that this this

vegetabie tribe that that might be a

sign of importance because it doesn't

even taller okay um it's the sort of

worn lady's boot yeah like okay give it

to okay all right

he feels emboldened and puffs out his

veggie chest a little bit as they close

in around her all right and since you

are calling out to them she is now aware

of your presence she just can't see you

because you are invisible so she does

kind of turn and look behind her for the

first time seeing where the sound of

your voice comes from and she's very

confused

yes and then it is Oh Rachel roll a

initiative die for me it's only a seven

Chris okay I'll just put you in the

initiative order then no worries okay

yep so Evelyn as you fly out you see

this giantess turn and she isn't sure

where paltin is but she takes her best

guess and tries to bring her foot down

upon him paltin she has disadvantage to

hit you because you are invisible I

don't like it when people try to smush

people yeah we've seen bad things but

even on her low roll she rolled a 22 so

oh cool she is going to step on you what

this doesn't do quite as much damage as

her normal attacks all right she does 17

points of bludgeoning damage to you how

fortunate okay

that's Wow I'm gonna hit points to have

left hanging in 15 okay and once she

realizes that she has actually stepped

on you because she can hear your voice

go then she will try to step on you

again again was just add antic and she

rolls in 19 to hit on this one so she's

going to hit you again cool this time

she's going this is very traumatic

quickly boot veggie celery just you have

to attack now celery okay Dwight yep she

does 17 points of bloodying damage with

her second squishy footstep and that's

when you are mashed into the ground but

I still had death ward but you have

death Ward so you and that was one hit

point okay is that the same as been

separate from the snake skin thing right

yes yes

so the spell that Strix cast upon you

the death Ward's bell goes off which

means instead of falling unconscious or

dying you are now at one hit point and

just sort of pressed into a paltin

shaped hole in the soft ground under her

foot but invisible so if he takes that

much damage does he become visible

I know so what it looks like is after

your voice is silenced and you were

pressed down into the earth she lifts

her foot off and there's a holding shape

indentation with nothing in it and you

don't see anything on the bottom of her

boot either it's like she just squished

paltin into the very earth and evylyn

what do you do on your turn well

considering that I have watched Simon be

crushed by a giant before yes oh by

whatever he was crushed by this is very

very traumatic for you

and she was already booking it right

toward Politan to help okay and so as I

remember it she's exactly something like

30 feet away from the giant yeah okay so

you see evil ins like her even when

she's fighting she generally has kind of

a pleasant demeanor you know like a

smile yeah you see something come over

evil ins face that's just like the

closest thing to rage you've ever seen

her eyes kind of get glowy a little bit

and she just takes out that flame sword

and just right towards the Giant just as

like all full force superhero legs and

arms flying at the Giants face at with

the great sword all right so the sword

ignites as you charge the Giant and

misses slow motions freakin sake even

with a +8 I get 11 okay your first swing

she sort of bats away with the with this

big she steals Brasher on her arm she

just kind of knocks the flaming sword

away but you have your second backhand

swing

evylyn still in full rage she doesn't

even care that she got bad of the way

there we go more like it that's 26 yes

okay and she's gonna put her divine

smite on top of the great sword as well

I thought so yeah she's ruled me out

so her normal damage of the great sword

is 5 Plus oh ok so 5 normal damage yeah

Plus 8 fire damage plus for the divine

smart look I'm grabbin dice um

[Applause]

9:11 okay then you bring your sword into

the side of her neck you cut a fiery

burning gash through it spilling her

cold blood and dropping her like a stone

dam just standing there with the sword

like hanging at her side suspended in

the air like and as this giant just sort

of Timbers off to the side she her hands

get thrown up in the air she drops her

great axe and Paul Tain's hand as she

hits the ground scuttles out of her

opened grasp across the ground toward

its master come back to me buddy says

the hole says he barely caught this hole

yes palton you can see the giant topple

above you and fall off to the side and

evil and suspended above you flaming

sword in hand vengeance

dripping from her practically I caught

him like nice there's an empty hole

there right you're putting your hands on

his face and all that business like okay

DF you're the next in line you see this

carnage yeah I was basically sprinting

my way back as I wasn't able to fly over

all the walls and stuff sounds like kind

of winding through yeah so so you crest

the outer wall of the palace which is

just this jumble of stone where you can

see a bunch of small little veggie folk

surrounding this blasted circle with the

dead giant is lying in it okay so now

there's just a bunch of veggie people a

ring of veggie people around evil and

all right from where I am does it still

seem like they're in a hostile kind of

stay

when the giant falls they ease off and

they just sort of stand there now with

their with a crude Spears their flinty

headed Spears alright yeah I'm gonna put

the sword away just to be sure yeah and

then it's just a slow approach like

gentle I'm threatening approached

towards were evil and in paltin are as I

try to figure out what that just happens

all right

Strix what do you want to do um I'm like

crestfallen because I wanted to blow up

the giant like I'll just uh but it

wasn't impressive but it was too holy

for her so she's she's just gonna like

circle back down and um I want to loot

that giant okay debating magic so in

addition to her helm which has a white

dragons fin on it but it's a gigantic

helm so you don't even sure wait she

just looks like yes but there is what

appears to be a blue sapphire like stone

set into the front of the helm which

could be pried out and it's quite a good

size the other thing of value notice

about her is a worn on a chain around

her neck is a red stone it's about the

size of oh like a soccer ball whoa Jesus

and it's attached to this chain and you

can see all these weird sort of

engravings upon it morals and ruins and

glyphs and things and you remember maybe

seeing her clutching it yes was making

her way around the battlefield cool

could I do an Arcana check on this you

sure could twenty okay actually

twenty-one sorry alright

you believe that this stone is has been

in source 'old to become some sort of

tracking device Oh for the ring

perhaps mmm got it okay uh evil and I

need you to smash this all right oh and

that's dragon bait we'll amble over as

well and he smells like victory Oh

whatever victory smells like I just love

him so much

[Laughter]

yeah so he smells like tar but he comes

over and just sort of watches the the

veggie folk warily but doesn't feel

particularly threatened by them he's

more concerned with making sure that

waffles is okay so pads up has up

alongside of him yeah they seem to be

good friends now waffles kind of like

some of this smells particularly just

like now that he smells like tar she's

kind of making funny faces and shaking

your head but whatever and as they sort

of settle in again emerging from the

surrounding jungle vegetation and the

ruins and approaching the ring of edge

'epic mises here you haven't seen before

eh a figure that can only be described

as possibly an elf and at this point in

time I would like Rachel to paint us a

picture of what she thinks her character

looks like sure she walks without shoes

now she has a giant pack on her back and

you can see there's one single boot tied

to the back of the pack she has very

very long black hair that's been plated

in these big braids that she kind of

swings over her shoulder covered in

freckles very pale gap in her teeth

which you can see when she gets closer

very cautious elven woman yeah and as

she approaches the the veggie folk

sort of

warm around her protectively and just

sort of follow her like a carpet of

vegetation whoa evylyn is paying no

attention she's trying to lay on hands

on Carlton but not being able to find

where to lay her hands on okay I will be

visible at this point you can sit up to

if you want and that might help okay so

you're visible you can see him now you

can see Simon pressed underneath him he

sits up after paltin does thumbs up not

until he stands up and brushes the mud

and the ash and the filth off of him and

then he gives you a thumbs up boy all

right

everybody seems to be intact the only

the only creatures you see is the Horde

of veggie pygmies and their elven queen

or oh um if we're are we out of

initiative yet I I'm going to say yes

all right um I just remembered that I

was also Arcana checking the box that

evil ones carrying the egg yes no I was

gonna I was gonna do another one of

those cuz I still haven't figured out

what it is yet okay so so well Evelyn's

like like I imagine that Strix is like

oh let me check that box again you know

comes over to Eva and while evylyn turns

around to let her look at the Box she

sees this elf queen and she's like who

are you who are you guys

I've never seen you here we've never

been here before that's why but we're

I'm evil and this is Strix that's paltin

and simon and that's dude that's waffle

or albear and that's dragon mate he

doesn't say much I never really know

what he's thinking straight

peeks around evil and it's like

[Laughter]

20 on my Arcana check by the way and I

just need to ask right off the bat are

you evil are gonna try to fight us cuz

we've been fighting a lot of things

today and I just need to tell you that I

just killed an eye strike and also we

chased away a red dragon so don't try to

hurt us and I have an idea I know I'm

not planning to kill anyone

so yeah worries there no not yet no no

not in general was it planning that's

good

you're real pretty oh thank you

where are you from what are you doing

here TLDR go you're staring at these

sort of hot messes in the middle here

and then this this sort of fellow kind

of strides over from the periphery this

young this young slender man very young

like 18 years we come from lands far

north from here so it's the reason we

are here is for one purpose only and

that's to stop the plague on this land

and stop rasz new city ok well that's

actually why I'm here too I mean partly

why I'm here I do need to ask have you

seen at a fling or a halfling around

here a rogue a warlock the fellows kind

of look at each other for a moment and

look at Strix later I'm like this was

funny strikes is like her she's just

shuffles away I did not mean to be rude

we haven't seen anyone like that no

we've been making it a point to try to

have his little contact with others as

possible as I'm sure you noticed

lots of people are after us yes I see

the list there's a big list so strong

now at this time the severed hand has

crawled up you paltin so that you can

take the ring off any you want to and

put it back on your hand or you can just

try to keep it on this cloth I am

already putting the ring on all right

I'm just after us I don't understand

what what is that

what no worries it's nothing don't worry

about it the less you know the safer

you'll Aranda you can make a in

intelligence check either history or

Arcana whatever you prefer sure let's do

actually yeah either of those and so

that's basically gonna be just an

intelligence check for you because you

yeah 18 very good

you recognize that ring it's

unmistakable because it is it was made

by elves it is called the ring of winter

it is a powerful elven artifact which

has long been assumed to have been

either lost or destroyed and it has the

power to do many many things related to

cold and in there in certain hands

including some of the ancient and most

powerful elves it could even affect the

weather on a global scale I see that you

are wearing an item of my people how did

you come about this we only have been

for safekeeping purposes death points

that the frost giant bodies on the

ground you see them he points at the sky

where cloth flew away you see what flew

away we're making sure that things like

that

don't have yeah it's way better on me

safe long mean totally fine it does look

real good on you

sure okay Wow

I am Miranda and I am looking for the

rest of my adventuring party we came

here to stop first as well

I'm currently wandering with this band

of little friends that I've made and I

might keep them a couple of minutes a

couple them are sort of patting her

affectionately as she talks after she

said that they're there to stop her

curse diff eyes immediately scan over

her and look for any kind of sign oh say

missing flesh possibly decay or anything

that would be similar to what they're

afflicted with she doesn't seem to be

suffering from any sort of decay brought

on by the curse oh well she has never

experienced the trauma of death the way

you have yet I'm still behind evil and

by the way looking at the egg thing yes

I rode that twenty yes so having given

it some thought and looked at it and

studied it more you realize that it is

like an instrument of Armageddon it is

it's basically a wizardly crafted device

that contains within it the the magical

force equivalent of about ten thousand

magic missiles no big deal just carrying

a bomb a giant giant giant bomb a huge

large bomb I'm sorry do I know how it

works yeah it's basically got a

countdown timer I'm sorry that little

crap that little clock like device on

the one side of the egg is the countdown

timer and it's it's you just you just

said

and walk away Oh Oh you have to set it

though yeah it's not currently counting

dude is not currently ticking or or

counting down at all okay you know maybe

not an apocalyptic census like so maybe

just be careful put the thing on your

back I was being careful don't you think

I'd be more careful I mean does it did I

scratch it's like when we need to kill

something big and leave very fast that

Aldens like oh I think you did scratch

oh wait hold on there's like a scuff let

me try all right thank you

we're all secure - and a curse of sorts

wait dude

I like died like two seconds ago man

it's like a daily thing now you got two

more on me okay all right I'm fine we

suffered the death curse we've all

fallen before and because of that our

souls are being drained away from our

bodies

do we know how much longer we have to

survive and while this soul monger

exists should everyone else also be

slain their souls are immediately

consumed and they can never be brought

back we're here to stop that then we are

in fact of the same mind I God was here

for the same purpose with my adventuring

party of if you would be so kind

I would like to accompany you I'm

looking for the rest of my crew and I

have a feel

that they would have continued on

without me when we got separated oh

there's no like dicks yeah are they

looking for you they should be looking

for you I have no idea I assume they

might be I do know that they were

kidnapped

um no big deal just um if we're

approaching the same goal there's a good

chance we'll find them on the way there

if you say they're kidnapped mm I might

have a good idea of who possibly could

have done that do you want tea that's

the ones mm-hmm

excellent then we are going down the

same path I'm glad to not be going down

it alone except for my veggies um this

one is celery by the way he's my friends

with the boot on top of their head

celery okay

so as you approach him you have your you

had have your hand out and he he just

kind of looks at it and you see him kind

of look around and there's like a burnt

tuft of grass and he sort of pulls that

out of the earth and hands it to you and

she's like thank you very much

did she curtsies very deeply and she

like tucks away the burnt grass like

it's very precious just start pulling

out burnt grass and just like he's

trying to hand it to them and after you

did that he holds his hand out evylyn

thinks I see that and I butt in I give

him a piece of a piece of gold

okay you go he will he will look at that

and then he just sort of wanders off

with that piece of gold we're fine

yeah it suddenly dawns on you that these

creatures might be enamored by every

little thing that's adorable like ah

wait wait no actually I want that back

hold on you'd best leave it with them

once you give them something you're not

getting it back plenty the Lysander

provides everything we could ever need

yeah oh we're not far now from where rez

nice Eli's and fact I made a shortcut to

win Miranda you know you've heard of

razz Niecy he is a you wanting warlord

rumored to lurk in this haunted city but

in your investigations with the help of

your veggie pygmy army you have you are

aware that there is undoubtedly an

entrance to the underground you want a

dungeon in the ruined palace no doubt

because you've seen you want tea coming

and going from there routinely but your

veggie pygmies know of another way into

the complex a tunnel a hidden tunnel

that they use as a bolt hole or an

escape hatch and that is outside of the

palace near where the river kind of

flows through the city and as far as you

know unguarded excellent well I may

happen to know of a way that we could

get in parsnip who is this one over here

this is describing a separate entrance

to me that may be unguarded it's by the

river

Oh wonderful the three guys they're

faster that sounds awesome

can we rest I ran out of fireballs yeah

before we go anywhere we just need a we

need a hot minute just to catch our

breath sure sir everything around them

we just just give us a little bit it's

like on fire yeah certainly uh that's

perfectly fine I'm not in a rush

especially on my own well we are

everyone catch your breath we move out

in 30 minutes one hour then Jesus was

dead like five minutes ago he needs a

long rest I see I say we take tonight

mechanically speaking I was gonna do a

short rest so we get moving right away

because if we do a long rest some of us

are losing hip points right that's fair

so some of us are at one hit point

though well you can say you'd spend your

head days of course what some of you

like some healing before we take a short

rest

yeah I could take care of I could take

care of them it's fine

sure I want to touch him do you need any

I guess it comes down to if you guys

need the long rest recharge all your

spells or some spells back is enough I

mean I feel like going in full spells to

the tomb is a really good idea yeah I

only have X amount of huts all right all

right you see but no these parts wither

than that we do is area nearby foilage

or something at least somewhat covered

that we can spend the night I can show

you where the budget thing knees have

been spending their time it's not really

much of a hut or anything it's more of a

clearing Oh No we'll take care of that

shortly I can take you there I guess

through the night because whatever time

it is was take there eight hours and

then we'll head out after that okay so

you follow Miranda into a section a

fairly nice relatively quiet quarter of

the haunted city the ash from the

distant volcanoes is still falling but

not heavily and so everything is sort of

covered with a light blanket of this

white gray smoke ash and but as she

leads you into the vegetation clearing

there are a few dry mounds that you can

kind of sit on everything else is kind

of surrounded by swamp all right I mean

works for me yes

and as paltin you're going to create

another hut it's like anyone who wants

to chill in like 70 degrees for the rest

of the day come on in Miranda do you

need a rest you know I'm fine I think

I'm going to stay out here and she just

picks like a little mound that has

enough of a level sitting which he can

sit down and just go into a trance

are you sure it's it's real safe inside

the hut she's just out huh okay all

right all right so you're all in you're

comfortably controlled surroundings you

see Miranda off on a nearby Mound

sitting all of her vegetabies have just

kind of surrounded her and kind of lying

flat around her and so she's she's well

and truly surrounded by them at this

point except one you see one of them is

standing outside of your Hut and just

staring at you all and he see through

isn't it like obscured

well paltin has the option of making it

opaque or transparent if it's okay he's

just standing there and staring if it's

sorry if it's if it's transparent he's

just standing there staring if it's

opaque he's got his face up again it's

dead so like I so it's uh it's not fully

transparent so he's like looking into it

but then I like see him looking so I

like squat down and look right up and

then I make it transparent all right

startled steps away hmm then Simon sort

of walks up next to you and does this

[Laughter]

like oh it's okay you're here you're my

only son it's all right yeah then the

bed you pick me under misunderstanding

is just like palton you see Simon turn

his head around

Simon turns his head 270 degrees back

toward you palton and his eyebrows

furrow I I blame the schools it's even

watching way too much TV

okay now Miranda you know that there is

all kinds of creatures that stomp around

the the city but there are places that

your your army is big enough that they

can watch out in the perimeter

and well and truly alert you if if

something creeps upon you but as fate

would have it you enjoy a quiet night

and you're all able to rest up by that

happen by the morning the the winds have

changed in the ash is no longer falling

on the city it's still hot and humid

even at this early hour but you're

relieved by the fact that when you step

out of the hut there is a mist that's

just sort of settling around you and

it's it's cool it's coming from the it's

coming from the nearby river

I don't like mist so I'm just gonna

hover on my broom above it okay it's

fairly low lying mist only about you

know 15 feet high so you can easily

ascend above it alright so we get a

floor rest yep and as you climb above

the missus strikes you can see it's kind

of spread its tendrils this fog

throughout parts of the city and you can

see it creeping ever onward it's kind of

spooky and hearing and strawed came out

of it okay yep it was real fun as she

mentions that I like just kind of side

glance at my shadow just to make sure

it's it's behaving itself at least for

now

it's tricks you see a flight of three

pterodactyls

high overhead yeah there they look quite

small at first but they've descended a

bit now you realize oh wait they're big

flying lizard creatures they seem to

just be circling the city lazily I'm

just gonna hover up here until I get

them okay with everyone one of them

eventually does have the courage to sort

of dive bomb into the city not at you

but into the river and it comes out with

something big and fleshy that's fun does

paltin still have to make a check each

day for the ring or is that concluded he

doesn't have to make a check anymore for

reasons

[Laughter]

cool right but one of you is going to

randomly lose a hit point because of the

death curse and that's going to be di so

that means evil and in Strix are both

querying the rings of protection plus

one right now paulten in Strix

so both paltin and Strix are wearing the

Rings cuz her soul is literally in them

so I remember that for your armor class

and saving throws yep and reminds me my

desk and as I sew dragon bait in the

morning kind of wanders off to take care

of dragon bait business and when he

comes back you see that there is a

creature following him and it is a baby

Triceratops you can see it has sort of a

smudge like a plank a pod on one side

that looks like it may have been a

number at one point already okay this is

my dinosaur I wanna I didn't cook

darkness or well it's technically gems

dinosaurs can I pet its tricks Kenneth

oh yeah yes the same as 18 I covered it

in poop cuz he told me to decorate it

which I had to do because I was under

didn't little contract so I did decorate

it but I decorated in because I

didn't like him telling me to do things

Evelyn was like about to throw her arms

around it to be like huh sleep baby but

then strike says she covered in and

and she's like and dragon Lake wipes

eyes dragon bait comes over to you you

can see he's sort of smelling of

honeysuckle and that suggests you that

he's just got some concern about this

creature say there's a baby Triceratops

it is a it is a young Triceratops it's

about the size of a suitcase

yeah oh it's just like uh it was an

adult when I wrote it what I mean when

Jim wrote it

what yeah it's a baby now I don't know

why they yeah you have no explanation

for this trick so you have like last

time you saw this Triceratops

it was old not old but it was a mature

huge elephantine creature

I mean price do you think it's under his

spell yeah maybe JIT mean Jim's a shitty

wizard maybe he did it I don't know you

can make it Arcana check all right I'll

do that

guys who cares it's a baby dinosaur this

is great okay you think that magic may

be behind this that there's definitely a

transmutation effect has somehow taken

hold of a teen and reverted it to an

earlier form of life all right yeah so

this is definitely magic I don't know

why what or who but it definitely should

have been an adult dinosaur now does not

[Music]

and suddenly be a big dinosaur again I

don't know I mean okay that happens all

the time right

I guess maybe with paulten it's amazing

we should keep it

it sort of waddles around you it's

gravitating toward dragon bait probably

cuz he smells so nice but as it sort of

wanders around it does recognize tricks

and comes over and kind of makes it

sound I see I see Miranda's disapproval

of the dinosaur and hold up the ring

threatening I don't know you enough you

had to trust you yeah and if she had

wanders over to waffles and waffles just

does this and just sort of just sort of

knocks it about two feet to the side and

it's sort of one of these even goes over

in like

[Laughter]

oops up like a whole group of her

clothes the other yeah yeah the ones who

aren't picked up are so insanely jealous

that they just sort of gather around you

and you become this mass of vegetation

after after evens like telling waffles

all that I like Paulding walks by really

quiet just like do it again it was it

looks like it might be following dragon

bait no matter what okay you know what

I'm okay with that

yeah Dragon Age II don't care that I'm

glad that he's found dragon baby because

I don't think Jim was a good owner yeah

I feel like you say dragon take herbs

dragon beat when you say dragon make a

taker I bet dragon bait gives you a sort

of a wide-eyed look in the meantime this

dinosaur is probably way safer with

death when you say forth uh stood with

Jim dark magic well when we move on to

our racing career after we just beat

this curse and deal with the show longer

then we can you know raise them as a

racing trustee or tops and they'll have

so much fun

Kristin I may teach us on a ride can I

can I make an ice dinosaur that looks

just like it yeah I could have a friend

cool okay tell me use the first charge

of your survival ring could bring up

odds a witness

[Music]

you want it to be you want to be the

same size scale yeah so a little a

little ice baby dinosaur is formed out

of ice using four charges from your ring

and this was really important yes Evelyn

is delighted call this one ice team okay

so yes i steam the baby ice dinosaur

materializes next to a teen there's a

baby real dinosaur was first appalled

and she's like he named it see he likes

it time to go yep is really a good use

of my people's magic I'm gonna say a

hard no uh-huh I would follow that so

Miranda

having having tranced and meditated for

the night and rested it up and whatnot

and given some thought to the ring

something else that you recall about the

ring is that it became the magic that

went into it was unstable and the ring

you you remember in legends manifested a

malevolent personality and that's part

of the reason why the elves sought to

rid themselves of it that malevolent

personality could still be he's trapped

in the ring so you don't think it's a

wholesome thing you think it is a

baleful item well gee a malevolent

personality at odds with paulten oh geez

golly

interesting just keep an eye on him for

now I'm not gonna say anything okay just

thinking about like what if the ring and

the gutter we're putting next to each

other what they have like conversations

fine you don't know sword talks shut up

Oh true the ring would be like more evil

Oh

they're just like these guys are idiots

[Laughter]

all right and Miranda do you want to

lead them to the secret entrance that

your veggie pygmies found yes yes do so

at some point we'd have so many things

following us around Strix could just

Christy just an episode where there's

known the waffle crew it's just all of

their companions just Nerys yeah oh yeah

so what is there at this point there's

got you've got the hand and the

marionette puppet Simon you've got the

baby dinosaur you've got the ice

dinosaur you've got waffles you've got I

guess dragon bait doesn't count he's

like a baby this maybe he does

and then you've got 50-odd vegetabies

juniper juniper juniper packed away

inside your your stomach just not being

fat yeah exactly

probably getting fatter yeah and am I

missing anything I think that's it okay

and gutter and the ring who also has

proposed sentient right so I guess they

qualify ister mom looks around just like

 with us certainly your numbers

went up when Miranda joined the group so

you come to an overgrown sort of lodged

in the side of a ridge near the river is

an overgrown tunnel mouth and when

Miranda clears away the vegetation you

see it goes down into the earth and it's

a rough-hewn passageway and according to

her veg 'epic knees they have seen

occasionally serpent folk emerging from

this tunnel but not with any regularity

okay let's just

I will probably take coin for now okay

and you have become being an elf you

have dark visions so you don't rely on

light to see those of you who don't have

dark vision

how are you hoping to to see you ahead

of you

my staff into a lantern okay so I'll

turn my staff into a lantern with little

green green light in it okay I will see

my Strix is light excellent you can all

do that

Miranda mm-hmm you what are you going to

do with all some are all of your

entourage you can pretty much command

them as you will I'll keep a small

amount at the mouth of the tunnel that

we just entered just in case something

follows us in or ends up coming in after

we've gone down I'm gonna keep one or

two about 15 feet ahead of us to do a

little scouting and then the rest I just

want to sort of surround the party like

a little buffer okay yeah the tunnel

you're descending is about it ranges and

width from about five to eight feet it

vas elates as it descends and when's its

way into the earth the veggie pygmies

have dark visions so they don't need

light to see okay so there's a couple

Scouts ahead then Miranda's there and

the rest of the party surrounded by more

of these vegetable folk they said and

there's one that Simon habitually likes

to trip about every I'm gonna ask

Miranda like so uh what do these guys do

do they do any of them shoot poison

darts no no no okay well do you have

like some kind of telepathic link with

them no no weird little little friends

that I made somehow like mine does that

that's weird

well you know it's simply down the road

I'm really gonna have something fun to

tell you about that ring but for right

now I know it's pronounced oh I've been

there

all right again yep the vegie pygmies

ahead of you you catch up to the Miranda

because they have stopped when the

tunnel finally breaks into a cave this

cave has you sort of emerged from the

tunnel standing on a rock pebble beach

that forms one end of this cave and the

cave is mostly flooded with water and

goes off some distance into the darkness

at the edge of the water tethered to the

beach are two boats canoes each of them

looks like they could hold about you

guess four people and their gear and

they're just more there's more here and

abandoned

now as you stand here on the beach and

look at the possibilities of where to go

next

there is this underground river that you

can head off down but it looks like the

beach also to your left

widens a bit and there is a recess in

one wall with a stone door embedded in

it I'll turn and look to the party and

point the different direction

where things are and then just any

thoughts on how to cross I mean how deep

is this river the water is quite dark so

you can't tell simply by looking at it

do you want to use something to gauge

its depth yeah I like scoop up like a

small rock or something like a size rock

off the beach or something today and

then I'll reach it out towards tricks

and tell her to cast light on it okay

okay do I have light don't think I have

light

I don't have okay isn't that just a king

trip okay oh yeah no sir yeah I don't

have that's not that's not my style

Oh Chris yeah can can the hand of hell

swim it would it doesn't have a natural

swimming speed so it would struggle with

swimming oh go ahead sorry it would

probably sink and just walk across the

bottom of whatever it was on but he

wouldn't it wouldn't drown no it can't

drown

oh so didn't really his tricks doesn't

have life so no I'm gonna chill just

grab it and be like I can swim I'll go

down and look really last time you did

that you got eaten up by piranhas that

was that time okay cool I'll find out

I'm just gonna I'm just gonna throw the

hand in the water okay what is dead may

never die okay so the dead hand lens in

the water and kind of floats there for a

bit and then just sort of turns over and

sinks to the bottom and lands in the

bottom I'm figuring out how deep it is

it can it can it can convey that to me

yeah yeah cool has it hit the bottom yet

it hits the bottom it tells you it has

landed on the bottom okay

do we have an estimate roughly how far

out into the water did you throw it like

10 feet 20 feet let's say like 10 feet

okay it lands on the bottom and you

gauge that it's about 10 feet out it's

about five feet deep oh oh okay

I'm gonna I'm gonna convey that and have

it come back to me deeply oh yeah it

comes out of the water all silver toward

you again good job buddy I'm gonna get a

little little bump

alright it hops up pops your hand and

lands

hmm why do we need to swim we don't need

to swim I just need to know how deep

this was come try to figure out if the

boats themselves or something that that

yong-ki need to use to cross because the

water is too deep or they can't swim

driver girl what is used more often by

them that door or these boats what I'm

assuming is down the tunnel this

direction where the water continues it

might get deeper down there which is why

the boats would be here yeah but I'm

curious about the door I have to invent

alright give me one second I'll go I'll

go to the door and start okay you know

see if it's like trapped or anything

maybe peek around the other side are

keyholes or whatever you know you see

that the the stone door has built into

it what appears to be a metal locking

mechanism okay and it looks at a glance

to be fairly sophisticated it's not a

crude lock hmm that doesn't mean it

couldn't be safe picked but do you want

me to peek through as a cloud pick locks

he could just open it save energy if you

can okay

let's sit on the ground yeah no I'll

pull up the Delta tools twirling my

fingers a little bit you have to work on

this lock well he's doing that

evylyn kind of like sidles up to Miranda

and she's like so why don't you do like

in your free time like what's your thing

[Laughter]

free time I well and she takes her staff

which is this big dotted like oak staff

and it has some like curved vines on it

and she taps it and sunflower giant

sunburn and she plucks it off and goes I

I make flowers is she like handing it to

me evylyn takes it like it's the most

beautiful thing it is it looks just like

the Sun and it it's just absolutely

radiant and perfect

Evelyn's like

no they don't because her face can't do

anything well her mouth is hanging open

and she's like you can see her eyes like

they don't cry but they kind of go a

little like her irises are kind of

metallic so they kind of just go you

know this is the most precious gift

anyone has ever given me in the hope

well maybe not the most but it's very

precious and thank you you liked it well

and she does it again and there's like

little Morning Glory flowers and there's

crazy noises coming from beside hystrix

just looks over from the ground is like

nine hell's is happening over there

there's like a flower or coming from

evil and like when you know in your

computer it has too many tabs open it's

like and you look over and there's like

flowers in her hair

like of her body they're tucked in her

armor and then she's also showing like

she really quickly takes off one of her

braces and like pulls her sleeve down

and she holds up her arm that has some

floral engravings on it in like the wood

pieces and she holds it up to the staff

and she's showing and she's like look I

love flowers - do you like flowers

what's your favorite planner to show you

she loves to show off her magical

so she has this giant cloak on her and

she ships it and some dust sort of

shimmers off of it and it becomes this

heavily embroidered flower cloak that

goes all the way to the ground and

before it was just like this dinky brown

little cloak and it's just a regal great

two high school girls who just had her

first sleepover a couple of the flowers

have fall to the ground and the baby

Triceratops has wandered over and

started eating them

okay now sneezing because there's too

much she's just making more Miranda's

still making flour too much flour

it just looks just like links arms with

her and is just like girl talking like

blah blah blah not even paying attention

because Diaz is handling the dungeon

diving stuff she's just you know we

should probably resolve that by the way

yes as you finagle with the lock you

trip a needle trap inside of it and I

would like you to make a dexterity

saving throw loudly 21

you're like haha you I knew that

was the needle does not stick you it

just sort of comes out of the lock

threateningly you can see that it is

poisoned once it has triggered it's not

hard for you to gracefully it

loose and remove it so that you can

actually continue your work on the walk

sorry guys I remove the trap on the door

yep nice make another dexterity check a

dexterity check for the lock okay

rolling around in the dirt

that's a 31 you have no trouble tripping

this lock and opening it okay so with

that it's gonna be just a very careful

slight open so I can peek through the

other side and kind of get an idea when

I need to wave Strix over so that her

lantern kind of shine some light ends

like right when you push open the door

it makes a grinding sound of stone

rubbing against stone that's just the

way the door is yeah it's quite Eddie I

don't like

and when you shine the greenish light in

you see that the air beyond there's a

room beyond its dimensions aren't

immediately clear to you but what you do

pick up on is the moist and sticky air

and there is some natural light that

spills in the morning light spilling in

through cracks in the ceiling so this

chamber is not terribly far down in the

earth it's it's shallow enough that

there light can enter from above you see

what appear to be stone workbenches

arrayed around the room and they appear

to be laden with all kinds of clay

bottles of various shapes and sizes and

the whole place is quite a clutter you

can also hear what sounds like just

trickling water maybe just sort of

seepage into the room you're not really

sure and there is some sort of pall and

kind of hand dust hanging in the air of

the room because the air inside is very

very still but I'd like you both to make

perception checks to see if you notice

anything untoward okay

19 you both notice that toadstools

snakeroot belladonna and other plants

seem to sort of sprout up out of the

clutter sometimes growing out of the

floor sometimes growing on a tabletop

sometimes growing out of a wall fed by

water seepage throughout the room and is

so excited moving among the plants and

tables in the shadows are some humanoid

figures that are hunched and moving

sluggishly and abnormally suggesting

they may not be alive I don't really

want to deal with that yeah and they and

you also catch this sort of the reek of

decay is there any can we see any exits

from there like stairs going up your

lights not this room is let's see 10 830

it's over 30 feet deep

so you can't really see the far end of

the room the walls that you can see to

either side of you however

don't have any exits in them hmm so that

didn't seem to be another exit in this

room if there there could be one on the

far wall across from you okay it

actually you have you have dark vision

Strix so you do you do see an exit

tunnel on the far end of the room okay

so there is an exit tunnel yeah these

these like creatures look like they're

tending to the plants right now they

don't look like they're doing anything

and with your dark vision you can

discern that they are probably zombies

and human ones at that got it

they're zombies I know should we tell

evil in I mean she'll want to hit them

really hard I know it's just like and

what flower is next we probably need to

go that way though Miranda shouts across

the waterway what's behind the door

Strix just absent my own egos it's just

zombies oh wait zombies even like in

full battle dress with flowers now like

there's just flowers all over her it's

like her war paint nah zombies what what

do what do elves not like anyone zombies

evil rings evil no boring door now are

they oh I somehow think you're lying let

me roll a perception check there's uh

there's giant pots of stew and your your

little veggie friends might might not

appreciate that we're not no I think

that we should take the peek in the door

I don't know what's happening so I'm

just looking at Dee it's like are we

I'm Miranda you're sort of shouldering

yourself toward the door to see what's

in it yeah absolutely

look arrests tricks like it was locked

for a reason that's true you can make a

perception check Miranda as you listen

and peer inside our fighting zombies I

poked my head in like like if she's

poking your head in here I poke my head

all right

Miranda you sense more by sound than

sight that some creature has slunk its

way close to the door and is waiting on

the inside for somebody to enter so that

it can ambush them Oh mm-hmm

interesting here it's breathing guys I'm

real good at undead I'm real good at it

well you know I think there's something

right on the other side of this door do

you want to you want to smash Evelyn

evylyn looks idea

I asked her is it is it also and is this

a zombie I mean so it's a zombie

I guess sick all right just to be extra

cautious dear Phil just mentioned just

to beware the spores growing around you

never know oh yeah cast a protection

from poison on the closest person living

person okay living person that would

probably be their Strix or DF or

yourself or yourself I can stay behind

okay I can do range I'm good okay who's

your target then between the two let's

do it dia okay

yeah if you have protection against

poison ray and I believe

resistance from maybe not good community

remember protection poison okay you

catch a creature if it is poison to

neutralize the poison for the duration

the target has advantage on saving

throws against being poisoned and has

resistance to poison damage so there you

go dear right okay all right

evylyn you gonna go in or should I call

you I'm gonna flower bot Evelyn shows

the the magic is the heart of Spinelli

to to Miranda and then she goes and he

goes in states with fire and then she

just tries to like reach around the door

right to where Miranda said the thing

was and was surprised just like stabbed

so think you're going to do it you're

just gonna reach around without looking

at it yeah okay so you have make an

attack with disadvantage but I have

surprise I know but you can't see

alright alright it's okay okay nineteen

that still hits all right and yep she's

showing up levander would be ashamed

okay seven normal damage and ten fire

damage but Miranda super impressed

so thanks that seems to wound the

creature and it makes a hissing noise

that chicken another attack to yes you

do

this time I like I'll I got the surprise

so in now this time I'll look around I

kind of step back way through the door

alright what you see is a a what looks

like a man who has some serpentine

features but as basically a man you can

see his eyes though are more snake-like

than human and he is about as you attack

him with your flaming sword he has in

his hand what appears to be a

jerkle device with a pointy sharp needle

at one end do not like oh heck I was

like a two-handed syringe no no no rose

dare you try to poke that in my skin but

easy make your second attack it is a 17

that too is a hit that will be a 11

regular damage and eight fire damage so

19 more all right

he is extremely extremely hurt by that

and rather than attack you he drops the

syringe on the ground and flees just

disengaging from you essentially both

did an attack of opportunity oh no

because all he's doing is disengaging

yeah so he moves away from you avoiding

attacks of opportunity and runs into the

darkness in the opposite direction the

chamber as fast as as his human taken to

stop him yep oh I'll take a bonus action

Chris Chris Chris I'm so excited what's

that

what you do i I'm gonna use a bonus

action to cast ensnaring strike on him

ah as from your last attack basically

okay go ask to make a senior already yes

he strength saving through and I imagine

that in this particular moment the

writhing thorny mass of vines also has

flowers on them of course cut damage

alright and this is a dexterity save you

said right strength same strength save

sorry

oh he's not great at those alright you

tangle him up in flowery vines something

like don't go leaving yet

and so yes the threat has been

neutralized so at this point in time as

you all enter you see that trapped at

least for the time being in evil ins

flowering vines is a you want II who

could easily pass for human

under a cloak or somesuch but whose true

nature is betrayed by some serpentine

features that he has chosen not to hide

you can see milling around the room

behind him are five what appear to be

human zombies and you can see all kinds

of like spore growths and plant growths

on them they also look horribly horribly

bloated and it's like they have sacks a

bloated flesh clinging to their bodies

people someone go poke like look at that

syringe and try and see if there's like

some kind of magic sure make a either

Arcana or nature 17 is that our Conor

Arcana yeah you don't believe that you

see it's a it's a sort of a brass

framework but it's got sort of a glass

canister constrain and a pump and

obviously the needle at the end the

substance in it does not appear to be

magical it appears to be nature II okay

I just look over and I'm like hey this

is an a tree I didn't say I only know

magic hold the syringe out there okay go

ahead and make a intelligence nature

check since you don't have the nature

skill it's just intelligence for you

20200 nice you believe that it is some

sort of horrible poison cocktail

excellent I'm just gonna pocket that

it's the syringe is about like a foot

and a half long so it's a good

sighs device it's got a huge sort of

pump handle and it's a two-handed you

know you don't run with this thing

through crowded hallways kind of deal

but you can't careful with that you

could pack you could basically tie it

off to you if you want yeah yep the

needle just like hanging out yeah yeah

this guy was definitely experimenting on

these zombies also by the way I pick up

as many weird plants as I can there's a

plethora a plethora wild on those plants

you also see on some of the tables these

stone tables would appear to be all

kinds of bottled poisons among them you

see a Stoppard bronze jug I'm on that

John it's a it looks like a jug of you

auntie Kraft has a sort of guts

serpentine motif to its design and it's

stopper is made of jade so while they do

that the F is going to try to

interrogate this ensnared Deonte yes I

will go hate him okay even like presents

him to them like he's all yours

yeah he sort of almost sort of towers

into his untangling vines he's looks

like a kind of a malnourished spindly

fella all right because first thing I

ask is what are you doing in here and

with them

[Laughter]

brilliant okay he cowers after the after

the strike and says I'm working I'm

making the perfect poison poisons for

what poisons to kill things even things

that are immune to poison will succumb

to my poisons no no it's good we're

gonna use this on anybody everybody this

works on anyone it will when it's

working it's still in the development

phase so you didn't even do it right yet

he says it's only a matter of time I

have gathered poisons from all over the

jungle from some of the most lethal

creatures and imaginable and when I

combine them their potency will be

incremental II increased thousandfold

perhaps and then I will use it to slay

our enemies do a really good job

are you sure Maria at this point has

like five different completely uprooted

plants and she touched them under one

arm comes up with the syringe and looks

at the guy and then just pokes it in him

okay

you stick him with a syringe and she

does that dia for the look he just goes

oops

[Laughter]

all right to this okay

well interesting enough just the one

point of damage from the syringe is

enough to kill him I kind of beat him up

real hard before so you just sort of rub

this in and then inject him full the

poison he just sort of swells up and

dies and then foam comes out of his

mouth and eyes and I think that DS is

like

I like crouched down to the corpse I

just like look him over I don't think

we're getting anything else out of him

let's have one twitch even retracts

there flowery vines like if you were too

bad of a cop yeah

Rena still got like the needle stuck

energy I'm gonna take that needle back

okay me gonna be careful with that

you wouldn't leave you pretty much

emptied out the thing when you stuck him

with it so but there are other yeah yeah

there are other poisons I'm going to go

get one and see if I can put it into

that syringe that I got yeah you can

basically draw it up through the needle

of the syringe or pour it in through the

top you see that the syringe canister is

large enough to hold several different

kinds of the poisons you can pour one to

combine them all all right you start

from my jug John's mine thank Sep for

the jack you're bored you heard the

judge making the ultra poison alright

you start mixing poisons make another

nature check just to see what sort of

potent cocktail you come up with 19 okay

you think like these guys yeah you think

you've come up with a particularly nice

virulent combination so you're pretty

happy with that a little bit of scorpion

venom a little bit of other good stuff

yeah I look at paltin or Amunet Simon

and I'm like nice I know you like

poisons you I would like to that go

search on the slain yontif or any other

anything i'm not-- okay he carries a

brass key which based on your pickings

of the locks suggests that opens the

door that you opened take it anyway and

that's all that he has on him everything

else around everything else the value is

in the room itself the poisons and that

the jug so hmm all right may your soul

pass into the light and be blessed and

renewed by the light of the morning Lord

from the darkness whence you came yeah

even though I don't think that soul

things gonna work off at port the corpse

twitches again after that blessing I'm

like ya bish

[Laughter]

you sure we're good she blesses them

again real quick just if they also fin

the room that it's worth checking out I

mean yeah it's just it's a stopper jug

so you don't know what you don't know

what's in it it doesn't there's nothing

sloshing around in it so can I just open

it and see

yeah you absolutely can and when you do

you release a billowing cloud of green

gas no god damn it just curious it looks

fine like a fair ha okay I would like

all of you to make a constitution saving

through versus poison right so you are

immune so now this is all so we're all

within aura would you say yes yes yes

there would be a 17 for me okay I like

to imagine that in this case she sees

the the green gasps go off and she

immediately goes like a like a like an

aura of like light goes out from her to

like hit everybody real quick as they

make their saves yeah I got a 19 okay

Miranda 13 okay do you have a +5 to

yours okay those nuts that we ate that

were protection from poison did those

those are clean off doesn't yeah I will

make a check the dragon bait and I will

make let's see who else is in the area

probably oh and there's probably some

better pick me is here with Miranda

oh no okay Miranda your your for veggie

pygmies who are

in the cloud all pass out but nobody

else is affected okay I'm scooping up my

passed out kids yeah like like waving to

push it back down really hard you

blended that you've kind of let it all

out it's just sort of all sort of bursts

out the prep it's like it is it was

pressurized so just sort of erupted and

then you couldn't control it's just

spewing out for about three seconds and

then when you realize you have to put

the plug back in it's already empty like

Oh like a one time yes it appears to be

now emptied it was obviously left here

for the sole purpose of you know killing

you but the gas is now beginning to kind

of settle in the room and you don't

think it's going to have any long-term

effects except Miranda's got four

unconscious betcha pygmies who seemed to

be in some sort of soporific state a

deep magical slumber yep I would like to

go and check the other side the other

other possible yeah you sort of make

your way over there and you kind of have

to slip past the zombies who are just

sort of wandering around yeah I'm just

like not in your Fury with them no one

touched them there they occasionally

sort of bump into tables and walls and

things kind of redirect themselves but

there's a pretty directionless right now

and close examination them you can see

that they've got marks in and suggest

that they have been injected with

multiple kinds of poison probably an

attempt to develop a poison that can

actually kill King things that can't be

killed by poison but you you angle past

them and you make your way up the hall

you can see in the light of Strix is

lantern that the Hall continues on for

maybe thirty feet and then opens into

what appears to be a larger chamber also

dark hmm all right

and based on the sound the echoing of

the sounds it's it's significantly

larger than the room you're in okay but

you don't hear any noises to suggest

that's occupied like you don't hear

creatures or okay not sectioned off door

anything it's just like open it's just a

nope it's literally an open hallway

between the two chambers and the hallway

you measure to be about 45 feet long all

right so everyone good to move on I fear

I'd yeah I don't like being around these

guys that make me sad are there any

extra bottles of possible poison coating

left around on these benches there's

there are so many kinds of poison here

you're pretty sure you could find

something like something to poison your

weapons a sticky poison yeah are like

geez all right yeah you find you find

two gourds that have a sticky poison on

them and basically they will add a d6

poison damage to your attack to your

attacks so what about darts you don't

see any darts there no weapons here of

any kind heck okay so with that let's

move on okay as you begin to make your

way down the hall what marching order

you're gonna go in and morandi it is a

little bit of a burden to carry for

unconscious fecha pygmies not mind I can

carry him sure

okay if someone else would like to help

me carry these yeah so even you can

carry two and marenick you carry two

they can side with the nice artistic egg

thing in my backpack that's we're gonna

call that the death machine for now

maybe don't put them next to that the

obliterator 8,000 yeah okay yeah so each

of the veg of pygmies they tend to be

much heavier wet these ones aren't so

that's good they weigh you know about

about 35 40 pounds each but you carry

them under your arms as you advance

Miranda are you gonna

you're gonna let DF pick up that slack

um if he's gonna go first I'm gonna be

at least right behind him okay yeah so

it's da then Miranda then probably Strix

with their Lantern and as you make your

way down the hall you can all see that

both walls of the hallway have a sort of

a undulating carving that's a that

starts with a tail and continues down

the hall the carving becoming thicker

and thicker and thicker and more

textured with scales until you finally

get to the end of the hall where you see

the mouths and heads of giant serpents

that form the ends of these carvings and

based on the motifs and other designs

surrounding these serpents it's not a

long leap for you to conclude that these

are representations carvings of denned

are the night serpent oh yeah when you

become more uneasy you come to a

positively enormous chamber with at

least well several axis that you can see

to your left and right and the room is

held up by giant snaky pillars it is an

underground Cathedral at the far end of

the room is a sculptured balcony perched

atop five rearing stone serpents blood

dribbles from the Serpent's jaws and

falls into a great semicircular basin

underneath them and from there flows

along a sloped trough into a great stone

bowl set into the floor you are standing

facing this

bowl and the balcony behind it to your

left is a rate as a staircase going up

or sorry a ramp going up to a mezzanine

which has prominently situated atop it a

gong a very large gong suspended between

stone posts the gong is carved with

serpentine patterns and stands in front

of a wide arch way that leads off to the

left there is another exit that you can

see a set of double doors to the right

no one's touching the gong in my hand

I'm like oh you don't see anybody on the

balcony you don't see anybody by the

gong you don't see anybody by the double

doors in fact you've seen nobody in this

giant Cathedral except and undetected

let's leave it that way for now and then

the perfect time to do it in a gesture

of like defiance even takes one flower

and lays it like right in front of the

bowl on the floor and just kind of like

glares the goal the bowl is about like

20 feet or 25 feet into the room so you

kind of have to walk toward it just out

between the pillars is all and to lay

your flower down but you can see when

you look up and there's just the just

sort of the dim light of Strix is

lantern cast on the ceiling that the

pillars rise up the the ceiling has sort

of an arched almost Brid kind of design

to it you can see carvings of the Great

Serpent Dende are protruding from the

walls and devouring the Sun well not

like whatever you can tell us about that

evylyn have added while she's doing that

thing I'll go over to the double doors

and start scoping those out checking for

traps locks you start to spill into the

room and so

around Halton is fixated on the Gong

[Music]

what's it like I'll like try and see

yeah see if it's blood blood or like

yeah I mean a religion check you can you

can both look both you and Strix can

glaze gaze down into the blood straight

back you can make a Arcana check if you

want can I ask the ring if it thinks I

should hit the gun the ring doesn't care

[Laughter]

that's a 25 ok what did you roll

19:19 miranda what are you doing as the

waffle crew spills into the room to

investigate the double doors the bloody

basin and the gong I'd like to find a

way up to the balcony if there's a room

back there behind the Bell

yeah that's that's an interesting

conundrum as you make your way toward it

you can see there doesn't appear to be

any obvious way up to the balcony except

maybe by flight certainly climbing the

Serpent's heads that's an X that's

support the balcony seems awkward that

would not be any easier than just sort

of flying or levitating up there there

does seem to be some sort of alcove at

the back of the balcony yeah it so

you're kind of wondering it's not clear

how anybody would get up there

can I very quietly go invisible yes okay

to do that all right even like look

Sandy's gone she's it would you do that

evylyn what did you roll on your

religion check nineteen okay

both you and strengths can tell that the

blood that's dribbling out of the mouths

of the serpents must originate from some

other place it's like coming it's being

fed through them into this bowl and this

bowl which is about twenty feet in

diameter and quite shallow it contains a

fairly large amount of it suggesting

that whatever has been blood leaded it

wasn't probably just one creature but

several some of the blood is old and

Caligula today and the stuff coming out

is fairly fresh but it's a disgust

thing rancid effluvia

[Laughter]

all right and at this point DF your get

over to the doors you can see that there

is a there are no locks on the doors

that you can see but it's embedded in

the stone our triangular plates at about

head height sort of equilateral

triangles on each one and they're made

of some sort of blue metal and Miranda

as you approach you can see as you as

you fix on the balcony 20 feet above

that that alcove at the back of it has

what you think is dim light emanating

from it but you can't see what you can't

see what's creating the light because

you're too low can I step back far

enough that I can see any of the floor

and then use hidden paths to get up

there yes so suddenly the rest of you

notice Miranda is up on the balcony and

what she has seen is this alcove has set

into its floor your disc with some

glowing glyphs on it

which suggests maybe that's how they get

up here lift yeah okay like a pad that

the incident like a stone pad that you

can stand on and those glyphs are giving

off light is there anything else up on

this balcony in the alcove no but it

does afford a primo view of the rest of

the Cathedral and as you turn to sort of

gaze out with your dark vision seeing

the only light source being that of

Strix in the middle of the room looking

down at the blood it is only then but

you see dozens of snakes pouring out

through holes in the walls

all around the room and I think I like

everybody that's real initiative please

know I'm gonna make my way to you're at

the gong-gong you're at the gong am I

alone dude my alerted of the stakes

before nope oh so strict what was your

initiative eleven dear Oh God

seven evilly I roll the Nashville 20 so

one Alton hey I mean 22 is - Miranda

fifteen okay Miranda you're not

surprised

I'd like everybody else in the room to

make perception checks nineteen twenty

nine ten okay

eleven okay paulten and Strix are

oblivious to the snakes pouring into the

room but DF and evylyn you are not and

neither is Miranda and actually I need

to check for dragon bait G 2 does not

appear to be surprised and he stayed

toward the back of the room he's got the

baby Triceratops and the ice Triceratops

near him and waffles looming large

behind him I'm assuming unless you

decide otherwise palton that Simon will

always stay a couple paces away from you

but actually you're invisible so he has

no idea where you are so he's kind of

standing in the middle of the room head

turning around waiting to see if you

appear as the snakes appear evylyn what

do you do you count it must be about

thirty of them all around the room I am

really standing like this at the gone

everywhere you look so I I feel that

probably my weapon in hand might not be

the most effective way for me to deal

with this

so evylyn

yeah even just centers on the snakes

that she perceives as closest to her

friends and just goes and cast moon be

alright

a a brilliant Moonbeam shines down the

closest once your friends are probably

next to D F he's the one closest

physically to some of the snakes so she

does it like right off his shoulder like

all of a sudden just boom right up to

your shoulder all right so when the moon

beam appears let me just refresh myself

with this spell I can read it it's

silvery beam of pale light shines down

in a five-foot radius 40-foot high

cylinder centered on a point within

range until the spell ends a dim light

fills the cylinder when a creature

enters the spells area for the first

time on a turn or starts its turn there

it is engulfed in ghostly flames that

cause searing pain and it must make a

constitution saving throw it takes to D

10 radiant damage on a failed save or

half as much damage on a successful safe

okay so you deal damage to them they

have to make some saving throws right

away that you're gonna get two of them

right away one of them succeeded and one

of them failed at it saves so give me

damage judi 10 I was thinking it was

that one gets 15 all right then half for

the other one all right so they start to

bake in the radiance of the Moonbeam

spell next to UDF these two serpents

they are both still alive suggesting to

you they are more than just ordinary

snakes ah crap

and then dragon bait will draw his sword

and immediately go after the nearest one

to him and tried to cut it in half and

he is going to hit twice and wound that

snake as well but it is still alive

miraculously

after he goes Miranda that disk in the

alcove flashes brightly and a creature

appears on it you you see it basically

kind of looks like that a half man/half

serpentine creature wrapped in bandages

clutching a sword a longsword that

ignites in his hand just like evil uns

how dare and he immediately comes out

sees you on his royal balcony and says

your companions are my prisoners

surrender or I will have them executed

do this to me - Miranda Oh - Miranda on

the balcony uh how do I know you won't

kill them even if I do surrender you

don't trust me it's all you have and

that's what I'm so sad Rachel will you

be able to join us next week yeah

alright alright maybe don't trust an

actual snake Chris chat reminded me that

I only read my spell card and not the

full spell in the book and it turns out

that shape changers are disadvantage

against oh so they are and these guys

are shaped changers and they revert to

their original form they do they fail

yes

so they've both failed which means they

are only exposed as you want to do

there's big people when they adore

before you one is male one is female

they look human but their flesh is

covered with scales and where their arms

should be our snakes it's too many

snakes they hate the light oh good I'll

show it to him yeah okay so next week is

gonna be really really cool okay so yeah
