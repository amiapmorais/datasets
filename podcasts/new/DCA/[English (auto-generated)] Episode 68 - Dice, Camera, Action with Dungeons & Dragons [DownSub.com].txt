hi everybody and welcome to the latest

episode of dice camera action

so ralph the bat first nate apologizes

that he can't be with us tonight he had

something come up but we will be really

busy guys he's really busy he's got

another life outside of us all I could

say is we look forward to having Nate

back in our group again soon

yeah so let's just kind of jump right

into where we left off last time the

waffle crew along with their guide

dragon bait and a priest of Torme

a half-orc priest of Turin named

umbrellas silver tusks made it finally

to camp vengeance which is a fort run by

the order of the gauntlet which has come

to child to basically lay waste to the

undead that are becoming a real menace

here but it looks like they got a little

menaced by undead themselves and the

fort was quite besieged and morale

seemed to be very very low and the

commander there a commander breakbone

was kind of an ass but maybe he's just

under a lot of pressure who knows but

anyway

Paul has tried to set fire to a dwarf

captain's beard but didn't even consult

a beleaguered and wounded soldier and

sort of helped him with some magical

healing embroil was off in a hospital

tent dealing with a bunch of other

sickos

and so the party hung out there for a

while and were drafted or rather

dragooned into working for commander

breakbone as a patrol because apparently

in addition to the undead threat camp

vengeance has been beset by little frog

folk known as groung an evil menace and

you guys went off into the jungle on

patrol with the goal of trying to find

where the ground come from and at one

point you were jumped by some groung in

trees and Holly Strix blew up a bunch of

the mother fireball Jared DF ran up a

tree and started stabby stabby killing

some of them and even what evylyn was

fluttering around with her boots with

some mushrooms that she was that she

whirled

yes probe poison mushrooms but you

didn't seem to have any effect

whatsoever you protected people you

absolutely did and palton cast a spell a

count of madness spell that drove one of

the grunt mad and sent it off killing

and murdering its companions at the end

of the battle the waffle crew prevailed

there were some minor injuries

waffles was a little upset because she

got hit with a cup of poisoned crossbow

bolts and at the very very end though

coming out of the bushes not too far

from waffles and evylyn is a baby ground

sort of a grayish mouth color and it

just sort of comes out and blinks slow

blinks it's wide black dome like eyes at

you all and that's where we ended last

week I think it was especially looking

at dia yes especially eyeballing dia it

sort of holds out its big froggy its

spindly froggy arms with longs for long

webbed fingers

damn it once you your daddy now oh yeah

takes out the map where he's been

tracking progress makes little market

sis all right on to the next Waypoint as

dia walks by he strategically you know

slams his foot down in a puddle so

there's water sort of cascades over the

fog master even keeps like like kind of

got like instinctually reaching for it

because it's like a little baby trying

to be held but then she she's like I've

heard that certain frogs and reptiles

when you touch them they have disease is

their skin I would really like to take

care of this poor little baby but I just

am a little worried about touching it

palton WAP Alton walks over and just

sort of picks it up and licks it and

then he just sort of drops it and be one

of those wandering off even even pulls

on on some gloves and goes after it it

wanders off paltin does oh paul-dean

wanders off now I go after the grog and

I kind of like the head okay you can see

that the drug is is sort of wet slimy

like a lot of tree frogs look and it's

it just sort of when you when you pick

it up it just kind of goes lip and this

kind of looks at you blinks it's black

dome like eyes I look at Diaz death is

like moved about 20 feet away these

things live in the jungle I'm sure

they're fine week we just killed its

family can I do

maybe I guess like a nature check to

know if Halton is hallucinating sure 19

yeah you can see after a few seconds

after looking at he's just like no way

is that more than normal or it's like

he's slowly a new world is unfolding

before Oh No thank you seeing lots of

frogs in the trees yeah and then he sort

of looks over in your direction strikes

and he's just sort of started such whoa

I'm gonna walk over entire rope to him

and just kind of drag him

smart smart and he III didn't know you

were one of them ribbit are you sure you

want to leave your skin behind just

gonna ignore that just make crazy eyes

pick the frogs

evylyn take take it with us and I find

like I don't know does anyone around

here have like a like a big piece of

cloth or like are there really big

jungle leaves I have an executioner's

hood you would like to use as little

sort of slip through the eye holes kind

of like a black diaper that you're gonna

sort of hang them in don't ask I wear it

like a little baby bjorn okay on the

front okay so I'm just hanging in this

pouch in front of me with his little

feet kicking and I'm like try even

though by the way evylyn can't get

diseases but she still has a germ thing

so she's just like she's like trying not

to touch him really but yeah yeah

evylyn we don't need that it'll be fine

on the jungle let's put it back we're

not running a friggin orphanage

everyone who has a heart runs an

orphanage that's not true that's

absolutely not true you want this baby

to starve out here in the jungle and

find its dead parents that we just

murdered mercilessly I mean better than

fighting us dead look we have a job to

do let's see it efficient we can get

back to the camp of her something else

goes wrong look at waffles if we hadn't

adopted waffles where would we be now

what about Simon where would we be if we

hadn't adopted them

don't forget the hand - I think it's

ferrets now crawling on you yeah we're

taking baby Grundy F with us one way or

another everyone on the everyone get

back on the trail so death where are you

aiming to the party at this point or

guide them with dragon baits assistance

I basically kind of did like a waypoint

of the directions that they wanted us to

kind of follow and I don't know where

exactly we kind of got pause that that

this ambush pretty much at one of the

sort of the farthest points you could go

before you would begin to circle back

around all right great

yeah so I wanted like start throwing his

back they said he was the north-eastern

area this one they were particularly

person in yeah so I found her we went

like hot straight East if we're gonna

make like yeah I'm sorry I was Northwest

yes our Northwest okay so heading north

west and base kind of making like a pie

slice circle around them back to the

point back to the camp

all right at one point so and I do any

kind of like nature check or something

to see if I actually think I'm like

taking this girl away from its habitat

or actually saving it sure my good

nature trick I used by My Little Pony

dice that you sent me they works great

during the live show hey maybe they

weren't good on animal things okay no

they don't

[Laughter]

yeah you're not sure what what the

repercussions they the biological

repercussions could be of taking this

wee little baby groan away from other

than you know that camp commander

breakbone thinks or despises ground and

things their mortal enemies fit and

might kill it possibly if you were given

a chance to well I do think we just

killed his family right that's where he

came from is like yeah he literally just

sort of wandered out from underneath

some ferns amidst the cat the end of the

chaos it's not good those be his parents

that completely different colors we

probably just stole a baby no no he's

just lost we need to find his parents

he's obviously lost do you think I'm

starting to worry that I might be like

you know you're no no you have a baby

bird if it falls out of the night is

drawn frog man blink your eyes twice if

you're lost it blinks its eyes like four

times about ten seconds okay if you

think so strict I believe you sure we're

putting ourselves in danger by having

that thing with us why maybe he can help

us talk to other grunt or poison our

food or just get in the way or somehow

call its others into another ambush upon

us there's no reason for us to take this

thing other than good we'll definitely

it's a dangerous jungle out here if it

would it would die if it dies with us at

least we can keep parts of it

strict some mosquito the size of you

know your face sort of flutters around

you and goes off you're like see see I

was prettier than like strikes really

wants it don't take it away from her see

how happy she is not what I said

Paul turns like you're all frog people

aren't you how did I not know uh-huh

I was gonna I'm just gonna like take his

wineskin out and just like hand it to

him

he like he just sort of goes like this

like you're having a mistake okay tell

you what

Strix right now I'm not gonna answer

that let's go do you wanted to go

somewhere word you want to go I hate

this Halton sighs why don't we ride on

that giant beetle over there is there a

giant beetle over there no but there's

this like this kind of slick rock which

has some moss on it which could I guess

pass for a beetle carapace if you were

half blind just keep going so you guys

know the moment bad thing starts causing

any kind of trouble or presents any kind

of danger to us then we will teach it

and help it grow it's gone I'll just

throw it through dimension door into

some random area I'm okay with that

it's always an option I would cover his

ears except I don't want to touch him

all right at one point in your shortened

journey here the baby growing says

something evil and that he hasn't said

before before it was just sort of like

croaks but then he says yeah but no yeah

man ugh what does that mean he said Yaga

dug this what does that mean I don't

think I think it's means something it

drunk but none of us speak rum I think

it sounds like he's calling for more

attackers on us why do you think

everything is cute and innocent because

it is innocent man I'm just scared as

dragon bait uses his sword to hack

through some underbrush you see up ahead

of you

the there is a gorge appearing and you

can hear at the bottom of the gorge the

sound of a distant River but a great

tree maybe about a hundred

150 feet long has fallen across the

gorge and it's now just this sort of

hollowed-out moss covered log almost

like a covered bridge yeah awesome

you don't like babies but you like tree

bridges and death is you kind of look at

the map that you were given by captain

Saldana you see that there is kind of

like a weird scale that looked like two

lines with a third line going across it

now you realize oh that must be this

thing no yeah all right good

the tree is so big around that the

hollow tube inside of it is between 15

and 10 feet 10 and 15 feet diameter Wow

so it's like the hallway yeah yeah cool

you guys ever want to literally walk

through nature cuz I sure did over the

gorge mm-hmm yeah you know how you don't

you know how this you know how this

works

how many gorgeous did we fall into and

how many have cleaned my life but you do

pose a very reasonable threat the two of

you should at least fly us we don't put

too much weight on this thing so I do

worry about that I'll go across first

with paltin and then afterwards know

myself drag dragon baton paulten would

go and then afterwards waffles just to

try to distribute weight as much as

possible not break through the wood I'll

just hold up my extra rope and be like

you know what to do yeah I'd like to

have some sort of contingency plan to

get waffles across could you could we

cloud waffles if we had to I don't know

we make our small enough to care oh we

can dollar no we can make her smaller to

make her lighter yeah that might be a

good idea I'm just worried cuz she's

putting on a little weight

she's looking fat and sassy these days

my kind of patter on the nose it's a big

fluffy girl like I'm holding a baby

growing in a like executioner's hood

baby yeah that cutoff was zero we needed

all right I hope that happens I call the

hand okay it it really only responds to

paltin otherwise it just kind of does

what it wants to do and currently it's

just sort of clinging on to strix I hate

I hate that thing it's fine

I will make waffles smaller and

concentrate with my large reduce spell

to make her lighter all right yes she

was a baby yeah she shrinks down to

let's see this year she'll change with

England size category so she'll be

bigger than she was as a baby but

smaller than she is now she's not her

size large yeah so her sizes halved in

all dimensions so yeah she's she goes

from being the size of a small adult

elephant or right now the size actually

the size of a rhinoceros she goes from

the size of a rhinoceros down to about

the size of oh gosh like a donkey okay

much more manageable and you cannot you

can like remove that when you want right

tricks yeah I have to maintain

concentration and I believe it only

lasts um

talk to her

yeah at last concentration up to one

minute to get across

so I'll just mount my broom and just

concentrate on keeping heard okay so the

plan is a DF and dragon bait are blazing

the way with paltin yes okay you got

paltin by the ropes oh yeah and the Rope

is just kind of looped loosely around

his neck and where paltin goeth so too

does Simon so the four of you go into

the hollow tube of the rotted out trunk

of this ancient tree you can see as your

as you step into it the the the tree

underfoot is kind of spongy and soft but

there's a thickness to it it doesn't

look like it's gonna break out from

underneath your feet easily I'm hovering

as close to the party as I can with my

flying boots inside the outside so above

the yeah okay

you can't once they go into this thing

period you might be able to hear them

from time to time

little they're echoes from within but

you can't see them very clearly at all

I'm just trying to make my aura be next

to them in case for some reason they

might need to make any kind of saving

throw you try to keep pace okay

that's your flutter make sure the light

of levander shines brightly on all of

them are you you'd be closer to them

probably fluttering underneath them

okay all right Chris Perkins yep that's

what I do

yeah and you can see there are like old

dead branches and things sticking out

from the underside of the tree that you

kind of have to flutter around

periodically you also see from this

vantage point down into the gorge

there's all this mist coming up you can

see the thin river that winds its way

through and it sort of tumbles down

various small waterfalls as it goes is

it like a burrow via creepy kind of

mists

no it's more like a warm almost

welcoming well you don't feel the heat

or if anything it's it's just it's just

kind of opaque it's hard it's hard it's

hard to see through yeah but you don't

you can't it there's this is cetera

Christmas it's a rainforest mist exactly

okay and then you said that waffles is

supposed to sort of wait a little bit

behind or is well the idea was that but

I forgot about Strix is reduce spell I

was just more worried about our weight

like about feeling waffles in the middle

between you guys so you balance out the

weight yeah exactly yeah right and you

want to be in front death or do you want

dragon bait to be in front I'll do it

okay

then he'll pull up the rear okay so it's

DF palton waffles yeah Simon and dragon

baby okay with evil on land side and

Strix your brooming it I'm grooming it

above because I I know there's a lot of

flying things here someone's just

keeping a lookout above and trying to

keep concentration on read spell again

you hear evylyn the baby grown say yeah

yeah is that let's make a song about

yeah but up yeah but never having up

yeah I'm just thinking alright and we

pass without any problem

evylyn and Strix I would like you to

make perception Jax I'm gonna stop using

this die Chris did you curse these

before you sent them to no no I get a

four okay and sorry Strix you rolled a

nineteen okay

I'm distracted singing a song to baby

dear no dumb bug or whatever no I

I named him little baby grandia no

there's only one DF I will kick him down

low scores Strix as the as the party

gets almost two-thirds of the way across

you through the mist see

something that looked like a kind of a

tumorous growth on the tree itself

suddenly sprout tentacles and move oh

geez and sort of crawl in you see it

crawl or sort of squeeze through a open

bowl in the trees length which would put

it ahead of the party making their way

down the interior of the log scream so

you all here I'm going to scream and

immediately dimension door into the lawn

in front of it like on the other side of

it ahead of the rest of your party you

mean no the rest of the party yes okay

so that Strix becomes the first thing

that it will meet potentially yes all

right um dude to do it complete anyplace

you can see one that you can visualize

or one that you can describe by stating

distance and direction such as okay so

yes you can you can gauge the distance

and direction you need to travel in

order to dimension door and the range is

so great that you can appear exactly

where you intend to

so after Strix screams I'd like DF you

can make a prescient check to see if you

can hear it okay cuz there's the south

so as you're making our way through this

thing the thing that is loudest to you

is the sound of the river which seems to

just based on the way sound travels

carry through here quite loudly okay I

rolled fourteen perception okay so you

don't hear Strix you don't hear the

sound of the river but you do see a

flash of magical light ahead

which you can Intuit to be one of Strix

of spells okay it's what I've seen

before for sure yep

so not so ratchet isn't quite immediate

like swords out kind of danger mode but

more like first thing you see is that

little flash of magical light which

could be like a doorway forming yeah but

that was done for a reason so yeah I'm

still so like I kind of like a gentle

pace kind of maybe just picks up speed a

little bit to kind of get there faster

yes going on but so no real sense of

urgency quite yet

okay everybody roll initiative all right

21:21 palton I said I'm throwing this

die away okay how was your initiative I

also got six oh six so we're even

okay all right oh I forgot to laugh for

trying a bait I'm trying these tomb of

annihilation dice next if they work

better than My Little Pony then I don't

understand the world

evylyn once again the baby groung says

and so some parties in the power of

nature itself to destroy us

did I hear strict scream yes

okay then I yell yeah and I'm like

trying to figure out what's all right

and let's see on this round since death

is too far away to see what's ahead

Strix you see a creature lumbering down

toward you it fills up the entire

interior of

the tree it is a elephant-sized frog

like behemoth with tentacles sprouting

out of its sides and lumbering along

sort of big fat froggy feet and it

doesn't have eyes like a frog does sort

of sticking up against it up out of its

big wide Maw is an eye stalk with three

bulbous eyes built into it and they're

also that whole stock is kind of leaning

forward and all three eyes are fixated

on you as it as you with your dark

vision see it barreling toward you know

it comes at you and when it's 20 feet

away its tentacles it's too big

tentacles come forth and attack you the

first one is a 22 hit you take 22

bludgeoning damage and you are grappled

biotechnical and then its other tentacle

will come at you and roll a 17 okay it

does 24 bludgeoning damage all right how

you doing I'm still alive okay so just

barely you are in it all right

let's see it's dumb but I did it anyway

okay and once it has you in its

tentacles then that's

[Music]

it's tongue will lash forth what am i

and I need you to make a strength saving

through okay I'm really good at those

guys that is not enough it pulls you

within 5 feet of it great and then it

opens up its big toothy mouth and crits

you do not want a role the natural 20

bytes you buy Stratos it bites you for

21 points of piercing and it swallows

you here there is a monster a little

growing says but we heard you yep thank

you yes and so dear you here's there's a

monster up boom drop it jump off the

course do ya hear up okay yeah I heard

the monster then help and that's enough

for me to immediately like go straight

to a sprint letting go with a palton

rope okay

just sprinting for as fast as possible

and as I'm doing that it's like it's

like pulling out gutter just like

getting there as fast as I can

cutting action - whatever to get up to

it how far it is but full sprint

alright so it's running in a 45 degree

angle okay after about in about a 60

when you run 60 feet you see it four

first time and you can see it's filling

up the entire interior this tentacled

giant frog monster there's an odd sort

of bulge in it and a staff kind of

sticking out of one corner of its mouth

that and you can see strix his hand on

the staff sticking out of its toothy

mouth great just in case

she hadn't heard I'll scream for evylyn

okay and then engage the frog all right

so I like I guess I could see what it

was clearly like a Strix bulge I know

where not to stab right yes okay good I

hate I hate this don't go ahead and

stabby stab a 410 okay does not does my

ally within 5 feet have to be conscious

for us trick first you can check yes

damn you said 10 yeah okay so guess it's

more like kind of hacking away at the

tentacles and try to mm-hmm

yep okay but it find an opening to

retrieve Strix it takes all of that

damage and next up is paltin who will

sort of saunter up behind d/f

and let me make a saving throw for him

he'll go ah

and then he'll pull out his mandolin

mm-hmm and he will start playing it and

he turns invisible what sounds about

right all right Simon sort of follows up

behind him and tries to shoot to this

big creature with a dart from its mouth

he hits it

good boy Simon for a whopping one point

of damage got him and the Frog he must

make a saving throw versus poison ah

let's see it makes it save and suffers

no other ill effect all right and then

it is dragon baits turn and dragon bait

will run over to it next to UDF since

you guys can fight side by side come on

a dragon bait I know I pulled a lot

other people out of other things before

yeah what does he smell like let's see

he smells like violets currently as hmm

well he has a choice you can either hit

it with his sword or you can try to pull

Strix free I think he's gonna try to

pull strings free what a guy see I was

finding out the tentacles did he get in

there yeah all right so he has to make a

strength check all right he grabs Strix

by her hand and wrist and puts his

reptilian feet up against this thing and

tugs and tugs and tugs and he is unable

in this round to pull Strix out of its

mouth

oh no does wait he just did that would

that be a saving throw

that's know that's a that's a strength

athletic strength made to break a

grapple I really wanted it to be alright

and so we come to Evelyn who is outside

the log and can't really hear what's

going on over the sound of the roaring

river and the sound of the little grind

going alright so I immediately I hear

this commotion inside you hear that I

hear nothing inside the log

oh I don't hear anything nope I screamed

for her to have heard you heard scripts

tricks to scream and that was it staying

yet cuz I have such a cool thing that I

could do if I knew what was happening

but if I don't know what's happening I

definitely wouldn't do it

mmm frustrating okay uh I run will not

run I fly to the other end of the log as

fast as I can okay um with all of your

movement you can get there okay I get to

the and I that's as far as I can get is

the other end of the log yep I look down

the log you see I presume I see the I

only see darkness hmm I don't hear

anything still now you can sort of hear

kind of the weird sounds of the log

shifting slightly and creaking and

groaning like there is something going

on in there that's moving the log and

causing it to sort of crack and break

and there's something big in there you

don't think your friends good you don't

think your friends could make that

biggest sound but I can't see it to

attack it or know what's happening yeah

it's just like a black hole after about

20 feet you can't really see anything

well but I can't perceive how far away

they even are from me correct um I'm

just trying to think of something that I

can do in the meantime

well I'm going to cast did you evah is

this a bonus action no that was just my

movement oh I used twice the movement

like okay then nevermind I don't have

anything I just stand there

alright strip Strix let's see do you do

at the start of your turn you take acid

damage but you don't have to worry about

that cuz you're already down but what

that means is you get one death save

failure okay and now you have to make a

death save at the end of your turn

because you're at zero alright one

success

okay still at this rate you'll die

before you get your last save yeah yeah

is your turn alright it seemed that

dragon bait is struggling like I'll

immediately like get up there and grab

on districts and like hoists or pull

with him okay make a strength athletics

check I don't know chaos that there's no

longer concentration on the spell on

waffles right

why did you know this is good we need a

big waffles get this big real fast yes

okay we've pulled Strix

out of the mouth of this creature and

just kind of like with such a sudden

surprising force that she kind of goes

flying out of the mouth over you and

just sort of flops down onto the the wet

wood that paul tunes feet behind you and

dragon bait and she just like falls

absolute face down just

covered it just catches on fire a little

and actually she's got like acid kind of

dissolving a few more holes in her in

her wet mucus covered yeah yeah it's the

huge uh stories about that mom whose

baby got caught underneath a car and

then she was something able to lift the

car yeah like that for that brief

instant I was stronger than dragon bait

uh yeah he's really surprised

smells impressed those wiry little arm

zodiacs really was what he was expecting

what does he smell like Chris right now

he smells like that would be brimstone

and and it's a it's a fleeting thing and

then it switches from brimstone to lemon

and then switches from lemon to ham as

he looks upon the hungry creature with

worry it is Paul tunes turn you can

still hear him strumming and visibly on

his yeah and let's see Simon or sorry

the creature goes next and let's CD ass

dragon bait das dragon bait dragon bait

is going to be attacked dragon bait is

missed with one tentacle and missed with

the second tentacle and then the

creature is going to try to bite him and

hits dragon bait with the bite

sure it's fine and the and dragon bait

is swallowed oh jeez don't worry I got

another enemy hold on all right can we

just stay out of the giant frog thing's

mouth for a second please

so down dragon bait goes except maybe

for his feet sticking out and then it is

Simon's turn Simon hits it with another

Dart

does another light does another one

point of damage the creature must make

another Constitution save Oh interesting

okay that's 40 minutes he makes it okay

so the creature does not fall

unconscious and it is dragon baits turn

dragon bait takes acid damage as he is

dissolved inside this thing did it look

like he was actually knocked unconscious

and sucked in oh he's all I'm in there

he was swallowed alive and kick'n killed

so badass yeah out of there you can see

you can see him kicking now actually he

kind of went in with his sword so he is

going to try to carve this thing out

from the inside haha he hits and he hits

and okay

you see dragon bait sword come out

through the creatures side and kind of

tear a jagged hole into it and let's see

what happens

Oh asked Mycah save me throw oh it

failed and as he carves a hole in it the

creature actually regurgitates him back

out haha and dragon bait is basically

spit out next to you death onto the

ground meet people with swords yep

and the creature looks quite wounded by

that all this acid and other bile is

sort of leaking out through that gash on

its side

and evil and what do you do I run toward

the noise alright as you run in you see

the back end of this mottled creature

there are two tentacles kind of trailing

out behind it that it kind of uses to

thrust itself along this passageway but

you're really only looking at its big

giant rump and backside I want to try to

get it to chase me instead of my party

and I you also see just above it's

almost right above it there is a hole

the bowl of the tree that it flopped

down through is kind of a above it as

well I mean I was gonna do something

fancy but I think I'm just gonna poke it

in the butt because I figure if I were

getting chopped in the but I would

probably turn around to see what's

chopping and that's what I want it to do

so okay I'm just gonna take tree bane

and say time for spanking and the line

and I'm going to roll a natural one so

ironically tree bane gets lodged in the

tree

I'm your back swing you're like luckily

no one saw that because right it's just

his butt to me so I'm gonna try again

okay this die better redeem itself

natural 20 okay you should be able to

have to brought the broad butt of a

creature yes yeah I'm also going to

expend one spells lot to do divine smite

all right as well don't forget to add

your extra weapon die damage for the

crit okay

wait how much an extra you roll the dice

twice yeah gotcha okay so we get three

plus five is eight on the crit and

and we get 7 plus 7 is 14 so 22 okay and

yeah that's it outstanding oh wait no

one more one more is it no one this

isn't 23 very good yeah you can you hear

all of you hear this thing let out a

horrible horrible croak that just echoes

up and down the tree as it gets wailed

from behind that's why you shouldn't try

to eat my friends and the rest of you

can hear the evil loons muffled voice

and battle call even though you can't

see her through this creatures bulk

Strix you've got another death save

coming I have a special divine sorcerer

thing where I can roll to d4 to change

my destiny it's like a special thing I'm

gonna do it that's plus four so that

doesn't matter

apparently this is your destiny okay so

you're at two failures and one success

lying there hopefully paulten remembers

that he can heal now or evil is nearby

but why would he heal this dead frog

creature in front of him alright nearby

but I can't get to you cuz there's a

giant frog but in the way that's exactly

right and I don't know that she's not

near death otherwise there are things I

could do yes

okay we circle back around to UDF great

after like pulling Strix out and like he

regurgitates grab dragon bait yeah and I

heard evil and attack it pretty much yes

alright so you attack now because ya

live so then I do like like a leaping

kind of stab and one of its ten

it's just like let's take the sword

reversing the health like doing a

leaping like a down stab at it and

there.good as like the blade enters in

presumably when I hit

I'll even yell to yell even yellow is

over ten feet away from you dang it

the things that be yep it is that big

it is thwarted you at every turn it

seems so DF yeah to make a feel a little

bit better because this is sneak attack

you have advantage I was done at that

point out that's D it all right hold on

so this is one okay all right these it's

a lot of ones 20 28 total oh okay that's

good this creature is almost bloodied so

you pull it out this infuriated creature

now torn between attacking you and

evylyn palton is then you can heal

healed up frog you do what I say no he's

the wrong frog he will cast cure wounds

spell on Strix using the manual alright

so Strix you get back 22 good points

that's good Oh apparently there's I have

another divine thing where I can get

more hit points back and I don't have

the book but someone I asked in chat and

Paul and say frog guys alive now don't

swallow me oh my god alright

the Frog monster is going to turn on you

evylyn it just basically it's kind of

got a squishy body so it kind of

revolves in place so that it's I stalk

and mouth are facing you evil and it's

PS exactly uses its tentacles to

basically rive its way around and will

strike you with one tentacle and missing

with the twelve it will print you on the

second tentacle so it just comes right

down on top of you BAM sure sounds like

really it's true yeah and actually it

comes down it comes down with such force

it sort of shatters through the bottom

of after it hits you it kind of slams

and breaks a hole in the bottom of the

tree trunk

bits of tree fall away underneath your

underneath your fluttery little fun oh

this stuff does give even an idea evylyn

you take 42 points of bludgeoning damage

from that tentacle nothing and then it

wraps around you and you are grappled by

it and then it will proceed to insert

you into its mouth or try I mean yeah

it's nothing to me but it's the

principle of the thing

that's too much yeah all right but it

only rolled a 15 on its bite attack oh

it's got advantage I forgot because it's

grappling you well no it's still only

roll the 15 on its bite attack which is

not enough to hit you right even right

great so you you sort of kick and stick

your arms out and avoid being shot or do

this thing's mouth yeah as the tentacle

is wrapped around your little body and

that's pretty much it for the creatures

dude 42 42 points and we were full

health before this unless you've lost

some hip points in the battle which I

don't believe you did they'd grown

battle I don't think he took any damage

in the groin fight I don't think oh no

you did because you got hit with some

arrows I remember I have a mark here but

I can't read it

oh I can't tell if it's also 42 or if

it's 12 it's 12 okay so I'm I'm down

before okay Simon will shoot another

arrow or another Dart this time he's

gonna go straight the damage poison one

he does three points of damage has to

make it come out but it made another

Khan save so good and dragon bait we'll

get up and proceed to hack at this thing

with his sword swinging twice hitting

twice and he does another 18 points of

damage to it

alright this thing is now bloodied and

we've come to evil ins turn well best

finish what I started I guess I'm just

gonna keep hacking at it yep that's what

I'm gonna do

alright I raised tree bane

and get it 12:12 does not hit and try

again

this time I get a 22 yeah aha

I'm gonna divine smite this sucker again

I'm shiny alright alright so 9 plus 11

and you're still grappled by the thing

you're swinging around I just my pen

away alright so I only do 13 to it that

time okay as you are 80 and damaged yep

as you were swung around there's a flash

of light as you hit from the divine

power that you send through this weapon

as you were sort of tumbled upside down

by the CENTAC alanda bashed around the

Grum pops out of his little

executioner's hood sack and goes running

off away from the creature down back

toward the mouth of the tree tunnel

babies yeah and you're hanging there

upside down in the tentacle just

watching upside down as this thing

bounce away from you on what looks like

the ceiling alright and and at that

point in time it is Strix astern Strix

you're conscious you're lying there you

sort of flop over look around yeah all

right great

and there's a still monstrous and

rolling around you're kind of looking at

the back side of the creature now its

tentacles have sort of pushed it around

so it's facing the opposite direction

and you can hear you can hear

evylyn through its bulk all right I'm

gonna try and I don't think I trying to

figure out what I have left after the

Quran say - yep

maybe not fire you know I'm not doing

fired so I look around

spot I'm about to do it look at the wood

and I'm like here maybe this stuff on me

is flammable too like in my head can and

I kept seeing her almost fireball and

then be like I think actually what I'm

gonna do is I think I do have enough

sorcery points to do a polymorph on this

guy who likes a polymorph this creature

into maybe a tiny AK speed okay baby axe

big here comes alright

you cast the spell there's a flash of

swirls of magical energy around it

it attempts no it's actually got a bonus

on its wisdom saves +5 it attempts to

resist the spell but the magic is too

powerful for it and it suddenly turns

before your eyes into a tiny little axe

peak vote which wasn't told and then yes

evil and you sort of just crash into the

ground in a sort of half in and half out

of the tree

you kind of land in the hole that it

made with its tentacle and just sort of

brace yourself there and yeah and this

little bird is just hopping around

maniacally merely go to pick up this

birds and then throw it out the hole

alright just make an attack roll to hit

the bird it can't fly yet it's a really

small baby right little axe things don't

fly do you want any kind of bonus on

that you're just essentially grabbing it

so just make a strength athletics check

okay that's a minus one so 17 total okay

you grab it by the few host it up by the

feet and then throw it out the hole yeah

find a hole and just alright none of you

see this but there's this little X peak

this flightless bird wily coyote style

just yeah

No all right but if Strix is still just

lying in a plight with our hand I just

on the ground in a puddle like covered

in ooze just not moving even for the

first time can see the whole party and

Paulson's there what happened all the

clowns

[Laughter]

where'd the clown's go alright I'll be

I'll get over to districts and gifts

will start like helping her to her feet

okay cleaning something to goo off throw

up some good Juan do you're gonna evil

then you can extricate yourself from

that wood hole yes I'm phased by it just

yep yeah districts cleans off her hat to

get out of this probably a good idea

stat check is everyone okay

evylyn Strix palton dragon bait yeah

waffles

Simon dragons madman dragon bait smells

like tar right now alright I know I'm we

did what we could do any clean must be

cleans the baby

he uses his cloak the outside of his

cloak to sort of clean off this sword

and then tucks it away he's badass

quickly I'm going to try and rip apart

there's a piece of this frog moss I want

a piece of them there's well there's a

few little pieces and chunks where it

was carved out by DF and evil and so you

can sort of wade through that flesh and

try to extract some there's some there's

some frogs no bile that you can collect

Oh gross yeah that's perfect that's acid

yeah I'll take some of that in a joke

just like put it in my room but I use

later yeah

all right I'll start walking down the

tonal you emerge from the other side

because just kind of like hover under

the whole like don't follow the whole is

easily avoided and do you make your way

out the other side back into the the

jungle on the far side of the gorge how

good and continue on your merry course

and after about an hour of travel with

dragon bait helping out by hacking away

some of the The Verge everybody make

percentage checks 623 okay DF well you

notice that the the jungle grows quiet

and your hackles go up and you sense

trouble and you can see shapes appearing

around you familiar to you because

you've fought them before more frog folk

are converging on your location in a

sort of Crescent in front of you almost

like they're trying to surround you yeah

you see a few of them kind of leaping

across boughs of high branches trying to

get into position and a few of them have

what looked like Nets between them

almost babies for bringing little baby

deer yeah stop

stop based on what I can see in looking

around do I see any possibility that we

can get around these frogs or avoid them

entirely and still make our destination

no three feet back to me you'd have to

go back the way you came okay you're

just saying words just like collapse to

the grass they're on our side

hot covering her face here we go maybe

she plays dad the frogs will think she's

dead okay at that point in time paltin

just sort of has room let me check

doo-doo-doo-doo what does he do yeah

he'll pull out some rations and start

eating them yeah maybe we can circle

back and take a brief rest and then we

can continue for in a little bit they

not yes I think they know we're coming

but I'd rather not encroach on groung

territory or whatever whatever it is

that's going on here is I could see it

there there look at the look to harm us

well they're not harming us maybe it's

all a misunderstanding

yeah they're not harming us is we

haven't stepped forward into their trap

yet well I don't mind resting but I

don't think that they mean us any ill

will I think that we're probably gonna

all be friends

I haven't able to discern what color of

these frogs are right most of them

appear to be green uh yeah see that's

the same color the Texas before but

there are other colors too I'm sorry

they're rather cool from the ground

I know there are also orange ones and

the purple one alerted all of them so

cool the color of the little babby that

we had is the only one we've ever seen

that color right yep that's right maybe

he was special

I'm just gonna look at Paulson from the

ground of apalta drama snack do it

paltin will take what he's eating and

just kind of throw it into a bush yeah

see we come in peace good there's snacks

and then the bush starts to shake a

little bit and Paul's like fireball

fireball as you think about kindling a

flame here your little grump end comes

out of the bush he's eating the little

thing that palton threw in there yeah I

say yeah burn up to him and see what he

does I hold out my hands to him does he

come to me yes basically it's up into

your face you just sort of grab him I

like keep him away from my face like oh

alright then you see coming out behind

him at this point in time is a adult

groung with orange skin bright bright

orange skin and it's got a it's got a a

short boat in its hand and a little

quiver of arrows over its back i and it

says I bow respectfully and say Yannick

and then I hold I I motioned to the baby

Greg and I go yup and up it blinks its

eyes at you the one the the one I'm

talking to that I don't this I know that

for the baby

what is that I'm emotionally it to the

adult like

the the adult sort of gestures with its

short bow and says people email me both

EEE bow huh

I'm looking at DFM Strix like then the

big ones sort of waddles over toward you

and points past you the way you came and

says blah blah blah yes I agree

we should leave oh yeah III pantomime

killing the frog thing I'm like hey just

make a that was very - perfect make a

charisma performance check I'm

channeling c-3po giving the story to the

Ewoks and actually if Alton will start

playing a little tune as you do it he'll

give you a d8 on your roll for

inspiration is okay it's either 5 or 9

which gives me a you said yeah

so 14 and he gives me a what d8 14 plus

oh no 14 plus 2 16 all right ride real

hard actually it's it's the inspiration

that kind of puts you over the top there

and you were able to with the music

convey and it's it's dramatic at all the

right times of course yeah exactly

exactly what happened and as you do and

you fall over the groom will come over

to you and just sort of help pick you up

I look really offended by that

no one you see he kind of takes you by

the hand and leads you off the way guys

I made friends off toward the north come

on do we do we go we don't know finally

I just talk on his roping me like no

we're going tied to is loosely around

his neck that was probably not the best

idea when we were worried about falling

from a tree as we started walking if

we'll just kind of gently say districts

they're going to throw us in this - no

we saved their we I think they're yeah

you're right

alright you are lead way off the beaten

track and you eventually come to what

appears to be in the jungle this sort of

still lake and there are trees growing

all up around it and from the trees

around the lake you can see lines almost

like ladders going over to the trees on

the island so the grip Li never have to

enter the water you can also see that

there's steam coming up off the water

indicating it's probably heated by some

sort of volcanic activity and on the

island you can make out all around the

shores what looked like crude mud and

thatch huts and there is evidence here

that fire has claimed a number of the

huts like there's been damage you can

also see that many of the trees overhead

show signs of fire damage as well

and they're sort of burnt and scorched

probably don't do any fire around here

strikes I'm not okay good

ice also I think racist guy did this

that guy sucks and one of the as that

you're followed by the this wave of

grown adult hunters who sort of back you

up and as they get to the shore another

one of the orange ones plays a horn and

there's another from the island and then

slowly but surely you see groung coming

across the water on what look like large

lily pads

but they basically use Reed's to row so

cute evil ins being very courtly with

that ruin just like how do you do yeah

but it's the only word I know I'm being

diplomatic yeah but no and when the when

these big lily pads come over you get

the sense that the the groung certainly

don't weigh much but you don't think

anyone lily pad can bear more than one

of you and you look at waffles and well

you're not sure any of these lily pads

can I point at the fire burned stuff and

look at the orange grog and just kind of

ask breakbone blink blink blink blink

blink this very racist make a making a

charisma performance check okay that's

enough to get across the basic sentiment

when you talk to one of these green

drums he kind of points to DF

[Music]

who's like pointed paulten why not

[Laughter]

[Music]

because paltin is already on a lily pad

playing his mandolin and being ferried

across the water toward what's probably

going to be a cooking pot I even asked

you don't have any any magical way to

talk to these guys do you know these are

used to and then I changed my cells to

have more damage so that we'd stop dying

well that was probably well advised but

not very useful here right and these are

not animals right

these are they're humanoids obey the

small ones just had to check dragon bait

smells like ham and you've come to

recognize over time even those of you

can't smell the ham that he does with

his expressions betray a certain look

when he's nervous and this is one of

those occasions when he's feeling kind

of nervous like this is gonna be a bad

situation but I think dragon bait looks

kind of nervous I'm nervous too I point

to the little baby groung and i'm like

'i bow like where should I take him

where it is although none of the adults

seem to give you any clue ok he's our

baby now let's go get paltin he's like

floating away I don't think you should

be alone right now I look back and like

the Rope is just he's not there anymore

like that yeah you're hanging out doin

the Rope is actually around Simon now

it's and you hear palton off and the on

the water saying I think it's wearing

off and come over here the little guy

and he just licks another it's like oh

yeah that's better yeah you think I just

I just need another hit yeah Dalton

that's very rude don't lick new friends

you read do we do we go look I think

waffles has shown that she can swim she

can swim alongside us I can fly it's fun

yeah I test the water even though I

can't feel anything and can't

it's like bath water it's like a nice

little relaxing hot tub right waffles

we've got you're under the beak you one

of those one of those swam waffles yeah

okay okay you find it's easier if you're

like down like sitting on it than if

you're standing on it yeah yes once you

once you get on and you get used to the

sort of the weird voyant effect and you

plop down in the middle they're able to

you're your farrier is able to row you

across pretty easily and you sit I'm

sitting on it but it's like knees up

yeah like I kind of want to get this

like slime off of me considering it's

just making everything sticky mm-hmm so

I might just use my dirt but I'm just

gonna use my alter self to give myself

gills oh I'm gonna hand my hat to dear

and just like swim in the water

very cool something I probably done

before it hatches

[Laughter]

so you and mumbles are swimming together

that makes me feel better okay as you

make your way across the water strix you

suddenly fall prey to what you think is

a swarm of piranha fish cleaning myself

yes you're suddenly surrounded and they

start to devour you you take you take 22

points of damage so strict starts to

swim and then suddenly she shrieks out

and then kind of goes under and then

there's this frenzy of blood the

spills out waffles get out of the water

right now and I dive in after waffles

does a little circle and goes back was

sort towards Shore I like missile dive

and I remember and I hands ebo evylyn

drops a bow on the lily pad next to D so

basically India's laps ODF is fraught

this slick little frog baby lands in

your lap whoo sploosh down into the

water

evylyn just make a perception check to

find strikes and Holly make a death say

of koala we're waiting okay I'll save

you all yes so you music you get one

success in your does save then suddenly

even dives in and comes out with strict

soaking wet and unconscious light blaze

of glory yes and where do you put her

when you have her on a lily pad you're

gonna go along the shores what I didn't

think this through I can I can I carry

her back to shore yeah absolutely

okay I carry her back to wall you drop

her waffles by this time has climbed

back out of the water you can see

there's actually like a couple little

Clippers chewing on her butt and she

just sort of shakes and they go flying

off she was smellier right yes and I say

dad I don't think waffles can swim this

sure would be funny if I was just like

[Laughter]

dad going away he's like yeah can't you

turn away hardly come back I'll ask frog

man can we turn around go back

okay I lay hands on strikes real quick

how many I give her 20 okay 28 points

okay I Pat her on the head I'm like hold

on and I fly back over to dia okay and I

yeah have you have you retained the the

baby growing up to this one and holding

on to it okay in that case I would like

you to make a saving through oh no you

didn't let it touch your skin did you

you popped it on my Constitution

Constitution saving through I didn't

like it no he didn't so what you are in

contact with but wait am i close to him

when he makes the savings route no no

you're you're still one I wrote 14 okay

you're fine yeah you don't actually you

realize that it does have kind of

poisonous skin when you kind of brush

your like a part of your arm up against

its flesh accidentally you can feel it

burn just from the poison but you

realize all these things okay so we

didn't even like returns I was like take

this from me I'll give back stresses hat

- all right evylyn goes to like put it

on her head and then she's like yeah the

water did not clean her off at all it's

just it just made it so that you know

when like pieces of cloth yeah hard

tricks when you when you stand up sticks

you realize there's still a clipper like

wiggling around in your underwear so

you're like shaking and trying to get it

out you rip off your pull your under

clothes off somehow without taking your

robe off and dump them out

[Laughter]

all right you can't make waffles small

again can you

I can't oh wait it's not small enough

for a lily pad no I don't think if you

were if you were to shrink it down it

would be small enough but it it would be

close call whether she gets the other

Shore in time hmm before she suddenly

becomes big again I mean if I rested we

could polymorph her what

I'm already on this ride oh yeah

dragon Bay it hasn't gotten on a lily

pad either he seems reticent dragon bait

doesn't want to go over there we're

splitting the party right now it's

making me very nervous when in frog land

yeah dragon Bay will nod put his hand

put his hand comforting hand on the side

of the great al bear be sorry I'll get

on my broom and fly towards Dias all

right I don't like leaving her alone you

take good care of her

dragon bait I'll throw one of the

Clippers two waffles like stay safe okay

he'll eat that nice as usual yep okay

and the rest of you make your way across

leaving waffles and L&L bear waffles and

dragon bait on the outside of this drunk

immunity yeah you can see evidence once

you get close that it looks like flaming

arrows were shot across the lake and set

a number of the huts on fire and burnt

them up but all the huts are kind of on

the shore of the lake and then as you

make your way inward you can see more

big trees and stuff but as you just get

off your lily pad DF and Pelton's

already standing on shore

you can see what must be several dozen

groung have come out to greet you and

they run the range of colors from red to

blue to violet orange and green as

you've seen before and then there's one

groung who's a little bit bigger than

the others and he's sort of a bright

gold yellow color nun the color of our

little baby correct

but you see other little babies hopping

around and they're just like the same

color as little ebo so maybe they change

color as they mature that makes sense

does the gold one seem to be like the

leader he's kind of the guy yes you can

see that he has he carries a staff a

stick that's carved and tied off at the

top of it is a live lobster and it just

sort of snaps its claws in the air

helplessly looks suitably impressed by

that

and then I I walk forward and kind of

like again very stately I say young ugh

and I say when you say yeah but now

there's some cringing some of the other

like children and stuff which is like oh

gosh they're booking in I said yeah and

then I say yeah II booked and I put ebo

on the ground in front of him and then

yes ebo kind of goes over to him and

then he takes the staff and whacks ebo

on the head with them and says something

as he as he bangs people on the head and

Abel's like he's right you know

and then contrite ebo sort of goes

hopping off wound his pride wounded for

straying this far from home Oh

discipline is very good for children

yeah and then another groung steps in

and starts to talk to this chieftain in

their own language and you get the you

don't understand what he's saying

exactly but you you hear the word yeah

but not mentioned you think he's kind of

right here yeah yeah yeah obviously

they're recounting what they believe

happened based on what ebo told them

after it ran away from you and the a red

drum comes over to you and or comes over

to the chieftain and the chief didn't

pulls out a gourd and hands it to the

red one and the red one comes over to

you and it takes its hand in the gourd

and it's got some sort of paint or

something in it and holds up its hand in

front of you I think he wants to give

him a high five does it want my hand and

that sort of pulls away from your hand

no evenly kneeled down he's trying to

give you a war paint I kneel down yeah

he puts the hand on your face and you

get this big sort of kind of bluish

colored handprint on your face even's

like she's trying to be polite because

this is obviously like a really nice

thing that they're trying to do but

she's like and then the preacher goes

back into the gourd and walks over to

UDF holds up the heck yeah I'll go down

onto one knee

okay it splashes you with that paint on

your face and strix how about you oh

yeah I'll do I'll go down oh just like

fall over okay just slaps the paint on

you as well Paul no Carlton no way man

keep your mind eating slugs away from me

[Laughter]

no no get away get away and they start

to like try to corner him as this and

suddenly he's running around this frog

creature with paint on its hand chasing

after him and then he starts playing his

mandolin and he takes to the air riding

the mandolin

Souls soars away can I attempt a

creative endeavor all this is all going

on yes I want to try to draw breakbone

with my staff in the ground or a

rendition of as you do that you start to

hear some of the ambient conversations

among the growing around you and they

all start to make sense to you what like

suddenly you can understand what they're

saying oh now we're tripping just like

paltin so all of you who are touched by

the paint nice whoa I stopped drawing

and I'm like oh yeah and the Grunch

Ethan says why are you like evil and

take it Strix is like it has none oh

it's it's my pleasure I am even avila to

helping maher zain light Forge servant

of our holy morning Lord Lysander and I

am so pleased to make your acquaintance

we just knew that we had to get little

obviously platters of candied bugs being

brought out to you and held out below

held out by purple groung well we're

here because we wanted to bring little

Evo home and also we were talking to

this horrid man break bone and he said

that you guys have been trying to kill

all of the humans down there and

possibly eat them and we were hoping

that maybe you'd just stop doing that

because he's gonna try to kill you if

you keep doing that and we really don't

want him to try to kill you and we don't

want to try your gun cause what they

attacked us oh I see that is very rude

of them and we will charge or

exterminate us why do they want to

exterminate you cuz he's racist oh

that's horrible and I turn to death and

Strix and I'm like they've tricked

this is horrible we have to protect

these poor groung people the brach I

agree with you in these grown people but

if they're attacking the undead I have a

feeling that they had some reason maybe

unless maybe he's just racist but I'd

like to think that they have a reason I

think he's just racist I think there's

probably just a big misunderstanding

don't stop even ask him ask him about

the zombies and skeletons and stuff oh

yeah do that I mean you can ask him

things too no you got the wheel on this

one yeah yeah that's fine yes would like

me to ask you about the zombies and

skeletons and stuff at this point I'm a

bunch of the groung children have

bravely come over and are starting like

cling to you and grab at you and so

we'll jump onto and off of you and

they're just you you're no longer at all

sort of intimidating to them they just

sort of think you're a novelty and they

what the chieftain tells you what a

number of the groung tell you all at

once because they all start to Yammer is

that the undead are a terrible threat

and zombies attack them all the time but

when the zombies go into the water the

the fish creatures eat them so this is a

safe place for them but man have bows

like they do and they strap pitch and

fire to their bows and try to light the

drums on fire that is just unacceptable

yeah and I'm sure there's just been a

big misunderstanding and you know we

should do we should all get together

have a little summit just have a little

talk

we'll have kind of an all-hands meeting

and it'll be great words will solve all

these problems they tell you that during

the last after the after the initial

human attack to try to wipe them out

they fought some some ground followed

the humans back to their camp and stage

to counter-attack but so many grown were

killed that the the chieftain is

reconsidering maybe not doing that again

but he tells you that they caught a

patrol and

two of them but two of them are still

alive oh so you were eating humans see

generally that makes humans real upset

when you eat them it's just a thing that

they have they they tell you that they

didn't eat the humans and until after

they were attacked by them yeah but now

they like the taste of humans you know

there's that yeah probably don't mention

that when we have our pizzas not

something that people generally like to

hear you do yeah if you sort of look

down there's like three groung children

all staring at you with big yeah I'm

just like in the mind argument even

pretending to care or even give them

like a mm-hmm not now you mean give him

the time of day and I'm entertaining I'm

just so you like the ones hopping off

yeah I'm just like yeah no reaction

whatsoever I want to do magic tricks for

them my goof do fancy little

prestidigitation tricks all right little

lights okay um and as you entertain them

with that there's some clapping and

stomping of feet and then the the

chieftain one of the Chieftains

attendants another red groung comes out

and the chieftain presents a gift to you

for dealing with Yavin ah

and you see that it is a exquisite

carved horn like it's meant to be blown

that's fine yes you can you can see that

it is carved with an image that kind of

looks like a Kraken with its tentacles

wrapped around the horn and sort of

foamy waves at the end do I think it

might be magical we're just uh yeah you

do oh yes

they tell you that when you blow this

magic horn it emits a thunderous blast

on a cone that can be heard far away and

anything caught in that cone can take a

lot of damage they they used it to sort

of blow away like a leaf blower

so four blow away refuse and stuff but

you could knock down a tree with this

thing they give you a horn of blasting

mm-hmm they give you all they give you

all a horn of blasting what no no I mean

standing there I receive it and I kind

of like turn to D F and I say I think

this should be yours as a reminder that

helping others always reaps rewards I

think it should be his because he's

really weak it needs to blow things away

from him that - I think it should be

Mike I don't get anything nice you can

see that it's got kind of the strap is

missing from it that looks like there

could be a strap attached from it to

make it easier to carry okay I don't

tell you that they they found it in the

jungle near the remains of some dead

explorers I thank them profusely and I

asked the chieftain how we should

address him because I realized I haven't

introduced well I haven't been

introduced you didn't he says you can

just refer to him as chief I'd like to

ask the chief obviously they followed

the humans back to the camp so they know

where the humans are does he think does

he know if the humans know where did

they are you mean in the jungle yeah I

like to do the humans is the chief think

the humans know where their encampment

is yeah they do okay yeah damn

right

hmm okay so the chieftain says maybe you

could tell them to stop yeah physically

some of them would listen so you two

have been dealing with this whole zombie

threat is there any other information

you can give us about them do you have

an idea where they're coming from yeah

the Italian eat them they tell you that

they the waves of them have been coming

from the lands farther south a place

called the AL Donny basin ah okay yep

Oh Donny is it al Donny da da da

okay yeah there's a it's a it's a place

that lots of lakes and swamps and things

but also some very towering plateaus and

other features if the humans like to

stop attacking them maybe they could do

an alliance with them and help them

defend each other's camps you get the

impression that grunting don't like that

idea all right they don't want to have

anything to do with ferrets there

I certainly don't blame them I just will

just take this message back to them and

we'll tell them that there's no more

need and that you guys are not going to

attack them anymore and that there's a

ceasefire and we have a peace treaty and

everyone's fine then we're all just

working together to kill these undead

right yeah okay good but you have to not

break that promise okay I don't like

being made a liar okay

yeah all right well I think our business

is done here we've done great work are

we are the prisoners oh yeah that too

are we always gonna be able to

understand you now that you've painted

our faces until the paint wears off and

then we have to get new paint or we

won't be able to understand you

what's the paint called I think it's is

called blue yeah even practices say it

like a frog go talk to these prisoners

thank you so much

thanks for heard of blasting in the blue

hey they will take you to the prisoners

who are hanging from a crude wooden cage

from a tree about 30 feet up in the air

and to make it easier on you the groan

will sort of untie the cage and lower it

down to the ground and you can see the

figures in there

they look fevered from being trapped up

here in the heat it's it's really

stifling here and it becomes increasing

you don't feel it evylyn but the rest of

you do the surrounding heated water and

stuff basically is like a permanent bath

sauna situation so these humans look

like they've been suffering here they've

been stripped of almost all their gear

really except for just their

undergarments and both of them are men

probably in their mid-20s their hair

sort of plastered up against their faces

and they look like that

they've only been fed bugs hey guys yes

one of them looks at you you can see one

of them is dark skinned one of them is

light skinned they both look at you and

they're surprised to see you at first

and they say did Condon I'll send you to

get us out of here so sorry captain bone

all right mmm they'll be real not

exactly he was leaving you for the dead

book yeah he just assumed that you're a

dead and he wasn't gonna bother here for

other reasons but don't worry we made a

peace treaty with the grog and now you

guys don't have to fight anymore why

don't you tell us exactly what you were

doing why and what have

one of the one of them says we didn't

want to fight in the first place

so one of them says to you that they

were sent on a sortie mission to find or

to basically hunt down and kill groung

on sight and bring their corpses back to

cat vengeance so they could be skinned

and strung up outside the fort that is

not cool but they were they were

overwhelmed because commander breakbone

one of them says is absolutely petrified

of these creatures and frogs in general

so for the record this whole groung

conflict didn't start until break low

and arrive at the camp

that's right I think that breakbone

deserves to this this one guy tells you

that and you can see he doesn't seem to

be any fan of commander breakbone he

tells you that shortly after they

arrived the patrol started to see wrong

sightings like the groans were paying

attention to what the builders were

doing of the fort because the fort

seemed awfully close to where they were

living but they weren't a threat they

just seemed to be watching them but as

break bones started to get reports of

these creatures his demeanor changed and

became more panicky thinking that they

were going to mount some sort of

offensive so he and he this guy who

tells you he remembers once when he

remembers coming down here with break

bone and break bone saw a frog in his

bedroll a long time and freaked out at

an ordinary frog thought the thought

that there are bipedal frog monsters

near him just practically drove him mad

with rage oh my god well wait until he

sees you bug yeah if he saw you I don't

know you'd probably just have a stroke

well you know what I think that if

someone has you know some fear issues

such as those then they probably need to

take

a break from their position of power

until they can resolve those so I think

we go tell breakbone the needs to step

down for a little while the other man

says that that'll probably never happen

I say we scare him out

why don't we collect as many frogs as we

can and overrun the camp just regular

frogs just regular frogs and I can make

some illusion big frogs we can get him

out of there I kind of like this idea

he'll never come back I I do feel bad

for these prisoners because they were

just following orders and I don't think

they've meant any harm or have any

actual ill-will towards the groung I

imagine right guys well they kind of do

now since they watch the groung

basically eat two of their friends but

if you're saying you know they want to

fight to the death against these things

no well what I'm saying is help us

collect frogs try to see if I can maybe

I can try to help negotiate their their

release and get them back to the camp at

least yeah that sounds like a great idea

I'll leave they help us get get frogs

yeah but only if you help us get frogs

if we have to get a million frogs to get

out of this place we'll get a million

frogs whatever you think that River

specifically I would like to return to

the chief okay and say basically you

kind of reiterate that you know I could

return back to the camp and help make

sure that they will not attack you

interview with you or cause you any more

harm however they need a sign of good

faith in return said they know that you

won't do the same I think a good way of

doing that is by allowing us to return

with these two other humans to show that

we least brought something back in good

faith I was gonna eat that one no I know

he looks real tasty but then he looks at

evil and what rumor kind of remember was

the evil and said earlier and it's like

okay that's all we ask

Leland's just hovering behind you oh my

god like a Strix already has five frogs

[Laughter]

mind yet like a proud mom cuz like

deaath hasn't been participating all I

you know he's been like kind of down so

she's like really proud that he's

engaging in diplomatic negotiation so

she's like just behind him like that

right so then after that I like returned

to the two prisoners and even just right

behind you yeah basically I was like all

right we can get the two of you back to

the camp but as previously stated

conditions you know help us get frogs

cuz you're like break bone we don't like

break bone he should not be in power we

need to get him out of here

Strix is already like she already got

you a head start

they're making all these croaking noises

in her bag what we need from you guys is

to one cooperate soon return to the camp

help explain that for groung actually

mean no harm and they didn't we could

talk to them they didn't mean any harm

they only wrote it yeah retaliated

because they were attacked first this is

not the threat zombies of a threat and

base to them we know where they're

coming from and we can help stop them so

you're coming with us if your brain back

you're gonna go to go see your family

you'd be safe you'd have to cooperate

you'd be chill about it they both look

at each other then they look at you and

at the same time they say yes sir and if

you do would do anything that would

somehow impede or put more lives in

danger I will kill you

they know it all right I was your

clothes still around or yeah the grumble

the Grum will sort of collect the stuff

that they took off these guys and pile

it out as they sort of unlatched one

wall of the cages sort of falls apart

and these guys can climb out stretch

their legs and neck

and then start to outfit themselves with

their belongings I don't want them to

have their weapons okay you couldn't

leave the wrong will run off with their

weapons all right yeah just so they're

not naked and they have like some food

or something and then with that I have

this map it we should be able to get us

back to the camp as soon as possible

all right everyone in agreeance here

everybody seems to be in agreeance last

you saw him he took off on his mandolin

so he knows how's it he'll find us he

can follow me I'm sure he'll be back in

a couple days treetop somewhere that's

returned all right

you gather up these prisoners you head

back your shuttle to cross on lily pads

all the drums will wave from the shore

as you're taken back dragon bait and

waffles are still waiting for you when

you return I'll even tell dragon bait to

uh take she'd give extra attention to

prisoners okay it's like an extra guard

like don't let them escape or run

anywhere or do anything

the prisoners tell you their names are

larsa and Wolf hi Laura Ann Woolf and as

you head off and you follow the track

back to camp vengeance using the map

that captain Saldana gave you and you

spend the night in the waffle hut when

palton finally Danes terrific okay much

to evens relief because she was very

concerned that he was gonna get long all

right

and as you sit there and it's Trix dumps

out her big bag frogs you didn't see

that she's she's collected about I don't

know 50 of them at least

so she tricks tricks tricks surprisingly

adept at this tricks I'm gonna say you
