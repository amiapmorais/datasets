welcome to dice camera action bunch of

us are around the same table

bonus bonus Sam I found the button guys

it's okay

previously in dice camera action the

waffle crew had an altercation with some

gas force out in front of their

residence and during the altercation

evylyn detected the presence of a fiend

and then attacked it with Ben winds help

SLU said fiend at which point Ben win'

broke into a detective agency and stole

a book written in all infernal blood and

eventually that book when did its way

from Ben wins hands into deaths hands

into strix his hands there's also in

bitumens pants first can't forget that

and not realizing said book was very

important to somebody else the waffle

crew was accosted by their own unseen

servants which turned out to be a

distraction that enabled an imp to steal

back the book and escape with it

evylyn charged after the IMP in an

attempt to overtake it well actually

defined it and when she activated her

divine sense realized that there were

eight more fiendish forces still in the

house so that's neat how many eight in

addition the waffle crew encountered an

old friend

frozen part a drow who claims that he's

got to put a hit out on one of the Zanna

thar's guild members and would like the

waffle crews help to do it

and pitch to the idea that maybe the

Zanna Thor would get off the waffle

crews back if they kidnapped its pet

fish

and use that as leverage to keep the

beholder at bay it's probably far so

that plan was put forward last week

evylyn what would you like to do once

you detect the presence of eight fiends

in your house okay

by bug and I'll leave you all with eight

fiends right here's the map of the

Waffle House in case you need it I can

actually show it to you because we're

sitting on the same table I the marked

on sections here are the destroyer

that's the destroyed section of floor

oops and that's the sort of destroyed

section of ceiling above so evil and you

fly through one of the windows into the

main floor of the house and you bear

down on the nearest fiend

it is a rat crawling across the floor

Greg's not mine actually that's not my

rat wait wait I just hear my name so

everybody else is upstairs on the second

floor well I think seeing a rat evylyn

would just double-check that it's not

Strix so you you concentrate on that rat

and as it quickly scuttles away from you

you sense that it is a fiend I chop it

in half all right make your attack roll

he's a bean rat he's a fiendish friend

does he does he have horns just a rat

that's a ten ten misses it your axe goes

back into the floor you lift up that's

better 27 27 that's gonna hit this

little rat go ahead and roll your damage

and this is a magical weapon so you

ignore its damage resistance hey David

yes

13:17 okay you cut that rat in half and

then you see it instantly kind of

transform into the top half and the

bottom half of an implement that the top

half just starts screaming and then it

just sort of melts away into a pool of

reeking smoking occur y'all we got an

infestation in here I heard him

screaming is that what I heard we have

seven more okay

all right let's reroll initiative for

everybody sure I heard the screaming and

we'll start with our illustrious guest

mr. Sam sakes I got a four four-four

cozy knees palton 22 22 evylyn 15 15 DF

my June 19 and Strix 13 13 and the imps

hmm oh that's in that 20 great all right

then so the amps go first

yep evylyn you can see that there are

some other rats crawling around three of

them to be example to be specific they

all kind of perk up look at their

severed friend melt away their eyes get

big and wide and then all three of them

look at each other and turn invisible oh

man damn it

those of you up above in the common room

can see that there are some other Ravens

flapping around they also turn invisible

and then you hear them kind of flap

downstairs into the main floor they go

through the whole floor down to evil ins

level so we heard them fly down yes we

heard their invisible wings fly away

from you downstairs onto the main floor

probably because there's a lot of busted

out windows on that floor yeah but none

of them attack they just all turn

invisible at that point and paltin what

would you like to do so I saw them all

go invisible and they're like flying

down so where so I'm on I'm up above so

you're

on the second level kind of up here

gotcha

and I and all that's happening like in

here yeah and right now all you see is

evil and down there fluttering with her

axe in hand okay and when I see them go

invisible I'm probably like I can use

some fairy fire mm-hmm oh that's an idea

okay yeah so what's probably reach huh

yeah okay you have no trouble

it's a the fairy fires effect Phil is a

20 foot cube no mistaken and yes so each

of those squares on the map is five feet

so you can basically get a four by four

area on the map cool then and we'll say

for argument's sake that Evelyn's like

oh right there okay and then so I just

really want to really want to cast Barry

if I are like wherever I like just saw

them like it's all where I'm suspect so

kind of in the middle of the room yeah

all right all right

random die roll says after you cast the

spell there is magical light around a

bird-like creature fluttering around in

that space but you only illuminate one

of them cool hmm the others must be just

as was it were their raven sized where

it is right it's like it's like you're

seeing the glowing outline of a raven

without actually seeing the raven cool

so like this happens and only like the

one lights up in the sky look city

volanges alright

that's Bolton's turn death alright if i

was able to hear one of them fly away

yeah I consider myself a pretty

perceptive person mm-hmm and knowing

that puddle was able to at least light

up some of them I'm gonna try to go

after the ones that we couldn't see okay

so I'm like listening for a flapping or

scurrying of feature I'll hop down from

that second floor down to the down onto

there to kind of chase after them okay

and just speed up to as quickly as

possible to dry

just just to Amelia /with gutter okay go

ahead you can certainly make a

perception check at least localize one

to a particular space right twenty-nine

you are successful you're able to follow

one of the flapping birds as it flaps

around yeah and get close enough to it

that you can make an attack against it

you're a disadvantage because it's

invisible right I wanted after the

flying ones because I'll give a fast

little scurrying rats they're bad at

disadvantage thirteen thirteen is

exactly what you needed

cool haha shop invisible bird alright

roll your damage is this a magic weapon

you're hitting it with gutter that's

it's got her okay you consider that

magical and yep or cursed another work

be nine total okay it does not die it

seems to have more hit points than that

and keeps flapping away from you that

doesn't break the invisibility does it

no only if it attacks or it cast a spell

not something follow the blood trail yep

alright then it is evil ends turn also

even has this divine sense so she she

can sense where the other ones are right

but they're invisible right so but she

doesn't necessarily need the fairy fire

so much as it was like to mark it for

somebody else well if it's marked you

don't have a disadvantage to hit it

because it is you would still have

disadvantage to attack an invisible

creature even though you couldn't use it

for divine sense to locate its position

if something that's invisible is very

fired he does it just go to normal or

doesn't get the advantage

so with fairy fire you have you have the

advantage to hit it so it's easier to

hit with the fairy fire

I think evens gonna same as death she's

like I have I have a an edge that the

other of the party don't have so she's

gonna go up to the ones that aren't very

fired so she's right ocupado mad hack

sad things on the floor

well paltin you know was like pointing

at it for her and she's gonna go back to

him and be like

and then she's gonna go after God I just

you got it I believe in you

so she'll go after one of the other

various ones that had just kind of left

the room then go ahead and make an

attack a disadvantage sixteenth that's a

disadvantage yeah okay so the lowest

roll is 16 that hits all righty and

that's gonna be 18 okay you murder

another rat haha turns into a pool of

gross goo begone fiend and that was just

your one attack right oh yeah so you

could move and try to get another one ah

I'm hearing a lot of smiting yes that's

a ten

okay that's a miss she gets too

overconfident no tries to just go on the

backswing but she kind of stuff I'm

hearing house destruction down there

your house needed more gooped Strix okay

so where I don't know where I am you're

upstairs on the second floor okay so I'm

buying in my room yeah okay all right as

soon as I hear the smiting and

destruction and all that you're actually

in here in the spare room because that's

what you are using is a panic room the

panic room okay all right sorry here

yeah the gas room which I also known as

the panic room yeah all right um yeah

all those open this door into the void

look out me like what sorry about your

book you see a glowy bird flapping

around

bonus points like dia shuts out

invisible imps several of them so

fireball or that work Oh looks around

like the bird as she remains so Strix

you would know that MCM you into fire

yeah yeah yeah no and she just says it

as an offhand um I'm gonna go ahead

though and cast

on the bird I'm gonna cast sacred flame

as Mike and trip that does a 3d8

radiant damage anything yeah they have

to make a well they have to make a 16

deck saving throw oh I'm sorry oh yeah

I'm trying to get the illuminated bird

yeah alright I had failed yeah I like

that radiant damage it's still green

though so you don't know what's waiting

pretty yeah like you think it's the same

fire she definitely wouldn't allow you

to see that it was radiant damage it's

not radiant damage oh no I have one I

just like didn't take it out of my ice

bag because I just got too overzealous

there it is alright 11 damage alright

you're eliminated imp Alton explodes

cool in green and dazzling green light

it's not really damaged so pretty and it

is dead

got him and then then Couzens right

you're standing on the battle you just

watched EF leap down away from you

okay Strix has poked her head out and

done some damage to an imp there are no

imps that you can see and no imps that

are magically illuminated by a spell oh

no see Evelyn downstairs whacking away

at things unseen but I know imps are

around yes so logically if I used my

draw ability to cast darkness mm-hmm

imps will be on the same level as us yes

your logic is impeccable what about the

one that DF wounded is can I reach that

one yeah you couldn't you could either

leap down and try to skewer it with a

melee attack or attack it at range you

would be a disadvantage because even

though it's been wounded it's still

invisible oh all right yeah just to show

I'm a team player I'll go for the option

that

has the least amount of repercussions

for me okay

and what are you going to attack with

I'm going to attack with my rapier okay

and I'm rolling and I'm rolling a

disadvantage right yep so world twice

take the lower that would be a 13 that

is exactly what you needed

oh boy refresh my memory how much does a

does a rapier do 1d8 plus your strength

or your dexterity if you're a dexterity

guy oh okay but you are um that's an

eight all right yeah plus 2 that's 10

okay yes you skewer this thing do you

see cozened leap down stab your prey and

then and you think what a great guy

maybe I was wrong to judge at the end of

Cozens turn evylyn you see are you sense

the remaining amps all sort of scatter

from the building dang alright they're

all leaving I'm going to try to go get

your book hold on it's not worth it are

you sure I mean there's lots of I feel

like making some more devils mad it's

just not really worth it I mean if you

don't want it back that's fine I do want

to back I do but it's just it's you just

gotta ask for what you what do you want

don't ask me that evil eyes I'm just

like it goes into her room anger later

and she can't close the door cuz it's

probably like bust it off so she closed

just like pieces put fly into the void

slams should I go get that book deal I

don't know it's quite a nasty to me it's

like too far gone right now they've been

distracted too much for these spies why

were they here you think Oh

someone wants that wanted that book

specifically well now they have it

that's probably not our problem you hear

from upstairs it's for sure a problem so

have all the other themes basically like

evacuated

yeah but the payments have retreated out

a readout of initiative yes point all

right well alright barring some effort

on anyone's part to go running out into

the streets because the guy who was the

one was carrying the book went invisible

right

he won't left out the wind just like

really far already okay unless you think

you can fly faster than easily could

turn I mean I can fly faster than an if

let me try alright okay Yvonne

disappears just let her go what do the

rest of you do thank you I stormed up

into my room so I'm just soaking at this

point because my magic book was taken

away which I thought was going to be

very useful

Couzens you're on the same level of

Strix the upper floor you see Strix

retreat to her room okay now in our last

episode Strix made me a pie yes that's

true I have I finished your call did you

save any or did you gobble it down I

mean I'm going to finish my pie okay

like this seems like a you guys thing

that's right is it you know you got

you've got you've got a lot of dynamics

going on and that's great but I'm not

seeing a lot of fish stealing going on

say history like you just work it out

and why where if there's any wine left

or is that done it's gone yeah in fact

well while everything was going on you

you actually had to go to the yawning

portal to get your wine fix for a while

because the the work on the bar has

proceeded more slowly than you'd like

getting those permits paltin could you

make sure the kids are okay they will

probably poke their heads out at some

point okay cool yeah at this point as in

with him like being themed today they

will they will show up and it's like

look at that just like that just like

that jobs done and then they all tackle

paltin not not fine and what a horrible

babysit like like like in a way you know

you're overly trampoline like cousins

will pounce on you favorite uncle all

right well evylyn attempts to find the

investigate with the book I'm gonna take

that brief moment to look around for any

kind of tracks or anything that could

possibly show how these imps got here

close through the front door that came

through the windows or the giant gaping

hole in the basement like anywhere so

make a wisdom survival survival for

track your tracks and I'm not sure it's

right there master imp tracker so you

look around and based on your estimates

you think that the Ravens probably came

in through the broken windows and the

rats probably came in through the gaping

hole in their basement leading all the

way down to the sewers now just standing

over your shoulder with like just the

crumbled remains of a paw yeah I feel

like upstairs you hear like Strix just

like nailing like beams into the window

to cover it up like now are you stealing

my stuff can squidly go try to find

Strix yes okay yeah and you you go

upstairs into the room where squidly

normally sleeps when they're staying

over

and strict says they're putting boards

up against a perfectly good window which

has just been sort of slid open if you

could just like slide close and lock it

but she's actually hammering boards okay

[Laughter]

now she finishes that realizes that's a

perfectly good window and she's just

like on her like workspace with the

beholder tactical just like she like

walks up and like pokes her in the back

of the head hi what what what are you

doing I'm I don't know why I didn't

think took my book I wanted that have

magic in it I was gonna help and it was

supposed to help the book was supposed

to help it was supposed to help all of

our problems and got taken away

why because bad people do bad things to

good people why because the universe is

a there's a balance between good and

evil and one has to outdo the other

until it balances out again and if it

doesn't that signal falls off the spire

and everything falls apart are you my

mom what no why because this cuz you

have horns doesn't mean I'm your mom why

you see strict pull the boards off the

window it's just like opens it she's

likely like starts like trying to help

her she doesn't know what to do she's

like can't talk child I don't understand

since and she turns into rats huh skew

like tries to like you like curls over

like trying to do the same he's like

how'd you do that

[Laughter]

do I have any luck tracking the IMP no

because it turned invisible shortly

after it left your building and

and I got it's too far away okay I knew

it I think she does like some widening

circles trying to like see if she can

sense anything but when she can't she'll

come back all right

stretched full just coalesce somewhere

down probably near the kitchen we're

cousins you take the pot I'll try to

regather the party at this point and

just kind of take a moment to I don't

know maybe discuss some things before we

run off and do anything else hurt

ourselves Sultan was like already on his

way out the door to get why he's like

yes right right now right NAT stands

like right behind to the side of death

like this as though she's also giving

whatever announcement he's given yeah so

if I had to guess most of these imps

either probably mostly came in through

this basement which raises the question

where that come from because as we all

know this a our clearly has a pathway to

us from those sewers right someone else

knows about it some other third party

whoever that book belonged to is raised

for concern Markham can't we deal with

that right now I'm gonna have to guess

at the servant runes being tampered with

has probably done under order by these

imps if they were just creatures no one

else would have seen that so I'm

guessing Dowd that's how that happened

so um probably the solution is go

confront the Santa thar and cut off his

eye socks

wait wait wait can we call the magic

lady Orissa Orissa Oh Cory Cory I'm

sorry can we call her cuz she was gonna

warn our house that sounds nice for 300

gold pieces per glyph awarding yeah well

hmm what what I don't know if that only

isn't that much money especially we

thought that she also said that she

wanted to cook what was it Commission

you know what Commission the other word

for helping people with money with

people who have money invest invest

that's it the best

in the house and me oh well if she wants

you that's nice but cozen said we should

go kidnap this fish yeah you know like a

fish would make a really nice addition

to a house okay before we do that

everyone take a moment and we'll take a

short rest okay cuz I feel like a lot of

us need that yeah sure

can we take a long rest oh no bad things

happened if we can't see you for more

than everyone takes 30 minutes eight

hours means more stuff's gonna show up

in our freaking house you know what

would be crazy is if we stayed somewhere

else this is our home everything it's

everyone's home everyone keeps showing

up and trying to blow so that's because

we have an open-door policy because we

blew up the door isn't there some kind

of like witness protection thing here

like can we like a cheap hotel or

something why do you want to close off

our home to those who need it I don't I

want to open it up to them I just don't

want to be here what they like you could

take the kids to the yawning portal and

stay there kids pack your bags we're

going to the awning portal there's

quickly get the poles with a little

sacks tied on at the end of them yeah

jinx is like oh boy can I have some wine

any other time I can do anything Wow I

know magic yeah you do Matt signs again

he is a horrible any other time Paul and

I would agree but I think we actually

don't need you for this one what for you

no it's fine I'll just stay here

suffering all right Chozen if you came

here through the basement and clearly

you know where the zenith r is yeah do

you think you could easily guide us

through these sewers back to where the

zenith Harlow cated guide yes usually no

no one but accepted Li yes all right

how long would it take us to get there

do you think maybe through the sewers an

hour without interruption only an hour

how loose is the story I have to go

through this exactly it's nice its

covert option we have uh what we can

real gross it's gross but should we

should we like what mine waffles in cyan

but what should we do with them we need

a babysitter squigglies likes I'm not

going to Simon you can do I actually

think Simon would be the best option to

I don't know maybe we should leave Simon

alone I'm Simon's I think we need

someone who really wants to go with

Strix

I'll go it'll be fun no Emily

world-class Archer number what didn't

you guys haven't heard the zipper she's

like she's like I'm not your mom alright

I'm not your mom

you don't know that I do know that very

surely I do in fact positively I know

that oh so if you're not my mom I can't

hang you don't hang with your mom I

don't think so I don't have a mom oh

maybe I do why this is what maybe

Warrington mutt wants the babysit we

don't know where he is I bet if I follow

up on any haunting portal I bet I could

find him he's pretty big dance will

actually yield down to Simon and

actually tell how I was like you can

watch over on my trust I trust him to do

that and then you actually look over at

NAT and well look at that and say you

also need to watch over your everyone

else keep them safe and keep both will

save - there's still a couple of rooms

upstairs that you can use lock

yourselves in there until we return do

not open it for anybody else I'm

counting on you that's cool with that

yeah but even is not cool with Simon

being left alone and keeps looking at

paltin like they could play together we

can Simon sign anything than that like

yeah he's learned some basic stuff from

that okay so

evylyn can ask him she's not asking

she's just worrying oh that's alright

hang with some friends for a little bit

do that he's been going through stuff

no sign of Simon what Simon is this

something you want to do are you going

to be safe sort of looks around or takes

it all in and says all right you stay

next to waffles the whole time you hear

and that you watch out for Simon and

Simon you watch out for NAT and everyone

else

squiggly it's like all right I'm ready

let's go

right that's right skids squiggly yes

you're on point for defense again if you

hear anything that's not us

you're me the first one to take them

down it's like I'm ready

yeah no not yet not yet okay I love love

the energy and attitude it's good keep

it keep it for that lock ourselves in

that room bored ourselves up get that

place fortified okay so they stay in the

room and I'll be on Patrol

go I have an idea I don't know if this

works you're a little you're your little

dehorn thing you can give it to them and

then if they want to contact us and they

need help they can oh right what'd you

say the range / rates

release just like 600 feet so you

wouldn't hear it yeah for traveling /

telling you know it's quite a bit

I tried it's a good idea though you can

just leave them alone with like a knife

or something we do that in the Underdark

all the time just let nature take its

course man I'll call waffles over and

have her just like grab squigglies cloak

and just kind of like carrying the drag

of also tell jinx say he can use his

magic to set up a protective ward

outside the door cool lava wall or

something he's like oh I'm on it I

there's love all around the house I

don't know how those imps got in I don't

trust them we're going it's not them

that I worry about we're going to get

the same guard

yeah we're gonna get in I'm gonna get

out nothing more

yes yep says he looks at red cozen

nothing wrong will happen no one is

going to betray anyone I don't know why

you would think that I don't know I

think that I don't say okay Paul was

just like okay instead I just give a

wink bones like okay house is unsafe

I suggest we stay somewhere else says no

let's go but leave the kids I don't know

I'm overwhelmed I'm not the party leader

so I mean yeah it's not my call well I'm

not my hope they can do this I believe

in mum oh no it's two against two should

we just like rock paper scissors or

something would any of our neighbours

babysit we don't know even talk with the

neighbors I'll do it you've done so much

for them okay can I talk I can be very

personal is that the plan okay we can we

can send a missive to the law to the

guards yes I know lieutenant there you

can use that God or to Todd we can use

it to have your waffle multiplied dear

top okay because that's the city watches

job to babysit straight children just as

a heads up our house has recently been

under attack by all sorts of evil forces

also just some mean people and sometimes

by dot dot dot accidents so if you

wouldn't mind keeping an eye on our

street troll skull alley and also the

children al bear and construct that are

staying in our house while we go on a

dangerous mission we would be so much

obliged hope you're well miss you heart

heart

evylyn Martha well you're doing that

strikes is gonna just start building

like some like of those messed up like

stick like effigies and gelareh witches

yeah yeah like those I'm just like

I'm up in the in the open polls and just

being like I don't know this year after

the neighbors yeah all this nonsense is

happening I'm just gonna go nearby okay

I guess mechanically speaking this is

all during the dark short rest period

sure that makes sense just give it a

little knock well Chris has the book now

I do that's right

well that's tear the reels that's so

well okay yeah so you go across the

street paulten and you knock on the door

of an herbalist shop and a member of the

guild of apothecaries and physicians

okay and it's a three stately

three-story townhouse the third floor of

which has been converted into a

greenhouse and when you knock on the

door a wood elf

with long braided hair greets you and

recognizes you and then looks at you

very suspicious oh hi how you doing

today she doesn't say anything

me ie me may I ask a a little neighbor

leaf from one resident to it she the the

elf who's you've never even ever really

interacted with her but she's obviously

spied on you a number of times based on

the look that she gives you there's such

an elven quality to this person that

it's hard to really distinguish if it's

a he or she and may not even be a it

doesn't seem to be I want to see ya and

they just start closing the door on you

30 seconds is all I need we're in

desperate trouble and children are

involved makeup persuasion job okay

no really opening children 16 they

stopped closing the door and leaned in

and intently to hear what you have to

say we have been tasked with a very

dangerous mission as I'm sure you see

that several times a lot of bad things

but fall unto us in our are very modest

home for no reason whatsoever we can't

even figure out why this keeps happening

it's very odd actually but regardless I

don't know I blame the schools but still

I think we have the children that word

kind of dropped into our care and it is

definitely not ideal for them to go with

us on this and they could just really

use someone so caring and lovely as

yourself to just watch over them for an

hour or seven alright alright fantastic

and also there's a cause for an elder

I'll be back Paul returns alright did

you work everyone get there a shark rest

and hitpoints back inside for spells or

anything that they need

all right all right cousin all right we

need to make this as quick as possible

yeah yeah absolutely it's just in and

out steal a fish kill the drow pretty

simple stuff yeah yeah you tell them

what em hmm I'm just like all right we

got a neighbor to watch dance come with

me let's go and the Alpha and the L bear

and the contract boy you parade across

the street okay

you knock on the door you're a little

bit worried for anything cuz the door

doesn't open for like a minute or two

but then you hear noise on the other

side bolt lock slipping past and this

elf opens the door wide wide stands and

it looks at you all realize widen it the

size of the L bear squiggly you can see

that there's a big ass like atrium slash

greenhouse on the third floor of this

place you got your eyes on that like as

soon as the door opens he's like oh wow

oh you look like you know way better

magic than the smelly lady and I'm

staying with they say come on inside

I'm follow and she just watches them one

after another walk in that she gets all

the way for the albear and then Simon's

there I like to think we taught waffles

to shake with new people

Oh bonk

all right down adorable so everything

about this place

- yup Alton suggests that fala is a

druid and there's all sorts of herbal

concoctions on niches along the walls as

well as plants growing rampant all over

the place so immediately the kids kind

of take a shine to it the spirit side

even waffles is captivated by some

Center odor and goes sort of stomping

off after them those can go on the

greenhouse mehron plants like peace

around I was like you have a lovely home

[Laughter]

and now we have a nanny yeah yeah yeah

that'll be fine yeah

bald returns sons albear Simon and kids

has made like 10 other now effigies of

sticks and broken wood at the door she's

like I think these work I don't know I

saw van rycke didn't do weird stuff like

this well kids aren't here so I thank

you Paul to me

yeah cousin let's go have a grand old

time

alright you descend down into the sewers

and Sam make a wisdom survival check for

me wisdom server oh my god wisdom yeah

that's that'll be a seven okay after the

first hour Oh God you realize that it's

not as the this maze of tunnels isn't it

a map yes can I follow can I backtrack

from that map absolutely

all right well it's like afternoon how

here's like my bad make another roll

okay that's a okay again you find

yourself at a dead end you learn dare

you turn your map around you look at it

again you walk back about ten minutes

you to another branch you try that one

out

make another roll okay got to be kidding

me

now it's a seventeen okay during the

walking just like here D yeah after the

first two hours of stumbling around and

backtracking

D a few here cousin go aha gives one of

those like ohm like terms of cosy I was

just like if we gotta pay the babysitter

overtime feel like storks during this

time would be like feeding the rats

down there just like throwing scraps

like even let's just trying not to touch

anything

she's like flying and like and I

promised her 300 gold so I mean if we

all make it out alive

done and done 300 gold from we're it is

carry on at one point in the sewers you

come across what appear to be a couple

dung sweepers sort of cleaning out a

clogged portion of the sewer oh wait I

know them you hear them before you see

them now they're easily avoided aboard

that yeah okay and now now Couzens has a

confidence in his step that may have

been lacking so he's starting to see

familiar stone formations signs and then

he is able to lead you to a wall that

has a secret door embedded in it and

crack open that secret door to reveal a

crumbling stone staircase spiraling down

into darkness all right so I mean so I'm

whispering now like how do we I'm not

really good at subtlety I just I've

realized that about myself thank you

stay under control as much as possible

until we call upon you

major magic all we'll need yours for

sure - and even if things go terribly

wrong and we come to a confrontation

you'll be needed for that certainly so I

shouldn't just go in choppy choppy

stabby I will chop yours are you sure I

am asking you to show great restraint

before now what are we doing

just for now stealing a fish Oh all

right tell me you said that that this

fish is most vulnerable during feeding

time during feeding time he's left in a

much smaller bowl his big bowl is far

too big to hold right and you think you

can be as to that I believe I can if you

don't think about how much time we just

spent leading back

to this yes no it's absolutely fine did

we miss his feeding window do we have to

wait another 16 hours is that what's

going on right now

uh the zanaffar seems to spoil him a lot

I wouldn't be surprised if he has

multiple feedings throughout the day

great I will have to rely on that and

again we're gonna try to stay as quiet

as possible though should we need it

distraction force that's enough even I

guess actually like take out the horn

little bit it's like you'll know all

right should I just be rats or something

like I just like hide be invisible

not yet but hold on to that because

there might be a few ways that really

help cozy you mentioned earlier about

these singing eyestalks

yes the santa thar has multiple

eyestalks jutting out of the dungeon

okay

and you know where those are I know

where one is but they tend to be in the

ceiling and possibly from other areas as

well so if we just keep our eyes open we

should see them before they see you

we'll keep an eye out but keep an eye

out for eyes then and then once we find

them Yap Alton turn yourself invisible

go in destroy them disable them whatever

excellent can we can we maybe just cut

off the eye stalk that does the charming

thing no there's a little spy ones I

know but I also I it should have come to

that yes but for now we need to think

about we also gonna keep the children

safe even just for now okay okay just

wrap all right cozen you want me to be

rats I'm scared not yet because I might

need you to cast spells before what and

you can't do that while your rats here

just stay close stay calm we're all calm

now no one's home this is a great Anakin

let's go let's roll what is your

marching order as you descend the

staircase cozy broad question what well

yeah but you're better at spotting I'll

be right behind you buddy

Wow

I will definitely tell you about my all

the dangers you're going to step on oh

good before or after I step on them yes

I will tell you okay

who's following cozen da ba ba yes I can

go behind the earth all right I don't

know

we'll go Strix then paltin alright

Oh a bit Fulton is to take down the eye

stalks though shouldn't he be further up

front yeah should give a little for

no problem hmm

it strikes and go in the back reasoning

able to see the eye stalks before they

see anything else

alright strikes will go on the back yeah

I just wrote it down push me like in

front of you I'm just like a plan we

made a plan be proud she push them

forward alright so strikes you were

pulling up the rear are you gonna pull

the secret door closed behind you chosen

does it open from both sides yes

whilst leader correct how heavy is it

it's it's heavy but manageable yeah we

have like is there like a like a rock or

something nearby that can just like keep

it crackling so it won't shut all the

way what's this closet yeah yeah okay I

just kind of just in case I make it as

minimally open as possible alright and

then you go down yeah while you descend

this staircase back at troll skull

alley-oop Coria stone marrow the Dwarven

wizard knocks on the door of the house

calls out to see if anybody's inside

realizes nobody's home and then goes

inside to look around see the effigies

yeah cool I'm glad we had a nice quaint

little camera cut away just so Oh

trouble back at the house Wow as you

descend this narrow spiral staircase you

can see carvings start to appear on the

outside walls carvings of opened eyes

that glow with a faint magical light and

they look purely

decorative like they're intended to

illuminate the staircase for those who

maybe don't have dark vision can I poke

one personally

sure it's just like a magically glowing

carving this is like holding under staff

saying as far away from the wall so she

can like and when you get to the bottom

that's going to tell you there's the

spiral staircase there's a door that

leads out into this hall okay

and this wide hall chosen will warn you

before you go into it that's where he

saw the first scrying sensor right okay

great

Alton you can turn invisible and then

fine do whatever is you got to do to

take take it out or at least disable it

what so so once I go invisible what you

want me to do find the ice dock okay

yeah well you just like chop it chop it

chop it off for coffee or poke it into

yeah I like just like pull it out of the

thing that'd be bad

it seemed if you cut him off they just

died so you just just use it just use it

nice or your son stories or just chop it

off with the Sun sword seems a little

extra but sure okay I will I'm gonna go

invisible yeah you slip into the hall

make a perception check upon entering to

see what you see okay give me 12 minutes

to navigate this

[Laughter]

you said purser something cool

this is so sad can this work nope not

that hold on hold on while he's doing

that I would like to remind dia that

there is a dwarf who thinks he's a

Minotaur roaming around here somewhere

right

also there might do you know what a

Grail is da you hear Strix going

that's all those brain things with the

beaks yeah one of the brain things with

a beak we're going I we're gonna have to

deal with that as well cool some more

details showed up 11:11 okay cool when

you go out into the hall it is magically

lit and you can see that there is a set

of double doors this way right there

they're big and round

with a seam down the middle where they

split open but they're currently closed

tight and you're looking around for some

sort of sensor but you don't see one

with your 11 you do however with an 11

hear what sounds like the Zanna thar's

voice coming from a door in the corner

that is partially open and has been left

so oh and the voice doesn't sound like

it's right on the other side of that

door

it sounds farther away I haven't gotten

super far from everyone or anything no

okay not at this point okay just like go

whisper to them yeah just convey this

really quick

so does that mean he's not with his fish

right now comes a that would almost

certainly mean he is not with his fish

right now okay right that's that's good

if we don't we don't want to deal with

him so he's away this is a good thing

this is fine I could just go deal with

him well you know the fish not Yeti but

I'll let you know okay we will evylyn it

so strictly I just it's very important

to say he understands the error of his

ways strikes like calls her over she's

like hey listen if we take his fish like

you imagine if someone took waffles how

hurt when we they did that how hurt we

were now imagine taking his fish it's

going to teach him more than just

killing him I don't want to hurt him I

want him never to hurt anyone else

well we'll teach him that through taking

his beloved fish you say so I mean it

fine here's a cookie this area where did

you see the eyes talked it was up above

the door I believe you had the double

door right above the double door did you

see a paltin don't look DFO colics

inches way forward and I can't get the

corners be like just make a perception

just like peek an eye out just to make

sure 27 you see it it is a ghost

it is a ghostly iStock just sort of

sticking down from the ceiling peering

down the length of the hall yeah the

right way it's like backs like yep it's

there it's just that looking for those

take it out it's not it's no surprise

you didn't see it because this is a

big-ass hall and it's a high ceiling and

it's not a very big I stopped coming

down from above and it's kind of ghostly

and spectral so yeah I thought you said

ice for something of okay I walk up to

it so what what's it look like

is it like way far up there or would I

be able like kind of like so you're

going to have to either climb up a wall

to even get close to it because it's too

feet up cool let's go work out my spells

would break my concentration or you

could just throw a dagger well it always

even when I attack I thought was just

the spell if you cast a spell or you

attack your invisibility goes off with

less unless it's greater invisibility

could I think cast greater then you

could okay cool in which case you remain

invisible even if you do take so those

actions okay and now I would like to if

I can steal a dagger off yet

okay make a sleight of hand wouldn't

make a perception yeah some tells me I

noticed this dirty 20:21 if yeah he

slips a dagger I was like push he's like

as he's pulling it out I was like slap a

hand on it at the moment just go okay

try and just kind of okay you go out to

the hall and you roll the dagger you

don't have to make a roll to hear the

zanaffar say why should I trust you now

after all the betrayals and another

voice say it is time that we just put

aside our differences and dealt with

this common enemy do we recognize that

second voice at all you don't hear it at

all

paltin you can make a perception check

to see if you recognize the second voice

18 it does sound familiar it sounds like

one of the guys you fought it chair Khan

one of the leather-clad fellows Oh in

fact it was the guy that you cornered as

he was trying to escape in the carriage

okay and you throw your dagger and

making a chapel okay so what should I

oh you're making a ranged attack so it's

your dexterity okay plus your

proficiency bonus just dexterity is 19

okay the dagger goes through the ghostly

I stock and then it looks down at the

dagger on the floor what do you weigh

just went through it didn't actually did

not hurt at all it's like it it like the

thing it has no substance it's

transparent I just I'm just like it's

just looking at it it's just looking

down at the dagger now if I were to pick

up the dagger would okay so when

withheld objects while invisible there's

something I pick up turn invisible yeah

if it's something that you can

reasonably carry it would turn invisible

I just kind of like put an invisible

handle on this so it disappears I just

watch okay the eye is now just focused

on that location and looking intently

and then it looks up and around the hall

and looks back down to the dagger see if

where it went

it looks momentarily confused it's like

a dog when you turn off a laser pointer

yes yes

I guess I'm sorry these were like cool

weapons are extra let me look at it I

know magic can I see it

you peek out mm-hmm make a stealth check

all right the eye looks right at you as

you peer around

I like Chuck the dagger in a different

direction the halt is one thing ting

ting ting the eye looks away thank you

back that looks back for the staircase

and you hear coming from where the Santa

thar is the zenith are say look I don't

even care about the damn store and the

voice say we're going to put out a

couple of our agents these are not your

normal as interim agents these agents

can look like anyone by the time we're

done with them they'll be in such

trouble with the local law they'll be

lucky if they don't get out of prison

for the rest of their lives what do you

mean these agents they're called

doppelgangers do all of us here this

just

I like this plan so I will I'm assuming

nice I'm just like it doesn't see me bum

just like maintaining eye contact oh can

I did I see the eye stalk long enough to

Arcana jacket when I'm sure okay at

least at least I did that that's a five

okay so thirteen thirteen you believe it

is magical and that's a high enough role

to know that it's a sensor device yes

that somebody can remotely scry into

this hall using because you also know

with that role that it's a magical

effect so perhaps a dispel magic would

affect it right we're like an attack

wouldn't right I'm gonna like go back to

the party okay be like so and I will

convey what I heard okay

do you know it's just looking down the

hall but there is this basically Klaxons

and we have to go somebody's can you

make evil an invisible I'm sure that's

fine

you could do that okay okay can I do

that with the because I already cast

greater invisibility but am I able to so

greater invisibility I think it might be

concentration yes so if you cast it your

your greater invisibility would

disappear evil Lincoln go I mean regular

invisibly isn't though is it yeah it is

it is so while that alarms going up and

let's go turn to codes and gave me like

cozen what is that that is probably what

happens when you try to kill a ghostly I

stop with a dagger

why don't you said anything I didn't

know what are you good for

well I knew how to get here

that's great cool I know about then the

alarm stops after about 10 seconds okay

I'll see it solved itself could that

possibly be like a feeding time thing oh

maybe maybe it's like a routine or maybe

we're being overly optimistic look I

don't know but so far we've been

standing here not capturing a fish we

gotta go capture this fashion we all

have to be someone invisible and how

about we just walk evil in it well can I

I can polymorph you

that sounds great try to Sun sort it cuz

it be invisible right yeah

the I suck yeah yeah you'd have to get

up to it and be able to reach it it's

orange right okay I'm going to try why

don't i can also try to cast my spirit

Guardians in there and have them attack

it it seems a little bit noise seem

excessive that's all I know how to do is

excessive let him try to use the sword

oh wait just kidding I would like to try

a dispel magic wait yeah

you see palton scrolling through this

little thing alright palton he's talking

to himself again dispel magic he does

not require concentration I don't

believe so you cast the spell and the

ice dock disappears Oh guys that was so

easy why weren't we doing that from the

start and he's still invisible yes right

great

good job where you keep moving it's just

like shaking yeah I'm with you let's go

do all this there's just one oh do we is

the door what we're trying to go for are

we go on the Dumbledore is where Pope

cozen went last time

yeah you're saying the fish was that way

right yeah this leads to the fish after

I believe it's after a chamber where

after saw yeah Harley you all right yeah

beyond the double doors cozen tells you

there's a big curved hallway held up by

pillars and there is a secret door there

is a secret door if someone comes down

there we could disappear in there

excellent I it was full of goblins last

I saw

I'm sure that's fine it's fine let's go

so while I'm little everyone go ahead

and real quick I'm gonna go to the door

that paltin told us about whereas

hearing this Anitha

it's talking I'm gonna check that door

real fast just see if I can close it and

to see if I can lock it from the side

that I'm on whether it has its own

walking mechanisms or if I can use my

lock picks to reactivate it hmm

okay so DF you immediately go for that

door you can see that it is a it is a

stone door you can pull it shut it

doesn't have a lock but you think like

if you were to take like a spike or

something to kind of jam it in okay

just so it's kind of it you could keep

it from opening okay I don't have a

spike but what a dagger suffice yes it

would be probably a little bit more

fragile yeah but something yeah

okay be something oh I'll do that just

to so you start to jam that in one of

the rest of you doing well DF is trying

to spike that door just keep moving

forward I'm just trying to write Arcana

check anything I can see like if there's

any traces of magic in this place

anywhere okay go ahead and here at caño

check anybody else do anything okay so

it's 22 you look around there doesn't

seem to be any other other than the fact

that the lighting the ambient lighting

here is created by magic they don't seem

being either effects about as well I'm

just kind of like walking up to people

or party members and doing the tap on

the shoulder thing and I'm done there

people's like oh I really evil and

you're gonna do that districts

I was just waiting okay you're really

gonna do that districts right now even

thinks it's hilarious while you as you

basically Jam this dagger in and you

secure it you maybe tap it down with

something as quietly and gently as

possible right and you probably have

like a soft mallet okay you didn't tap

it with the double door is open

and you can see in the shadows through

the doors a dwarf

wearing a horned helm has just pulled

the doors open you can also see that

there is a plethora of other creatures

with it

it looks like goblins and bugbears roll

initiative to talk to him

let's go say cozen you got past him last

time no alright strikes Oh 20 so 21 DF

also 21

evylyn 18 paltin 18 Couzens 11 alright

and what does Strix and DF do let's go

with DF first actually DF all that

starts go first thank you he's closer to

the front she's a little more explosive

than I am yeah well first I'd like to

yell because Pompton tapped me on the

shoulder and then I will I'm going to

cast darkness on them alright so the

double doors in the area behind them are

just suddenly enveloped in impenetrable

blackness good cool

Noah kids yeah well but they can't see

us right all right yeah yeah I'll take

that moment to after securing the door

actually make my way up to cozen and ask

him how did you get past the doors last

time oh he still thinks I work for them

but I might have trouble explaining all

of you well we're the renovation crew

that's right come back and see zanaffar

weird cuz he's my friend we were the

goldfish surgeons he's very sick

he you know the Zanna Thor did

specifically say he wanted evylyn alive

so maybe I just wanted to see him weak

it yes and I brought the rest and I have

a hat that looks just like his hat and

maybe we had with horn wearing people

can get along I think the last thing

we're gonna do is like zennith or know

that we're here at all and he probably

already does what would the klaxon and

the spells being cast you know just to

have some positivity I mean yeah it

right damn it

alright so Diaz who withdraw gutter and

then basically stealth is way into the

darkness area where you saw the bug

bears and basically lie in wait to hear

them pass them okay so you can

potentially sneak attack if like they

all just start throwing down make a

self-check

alright not 20 how about 24 all right on

account of my reliable talent bugbears

big beers all right there doesn't seem

to be any reaction yes to suggest that

they noticed you great even though

they're highly heightened at the moment

yep

looking for trouble somehow you have

eluded them great and I'm still lying

wait for the moment to strike

okay evylyn or paltin who wants to go

next

did the dwarf do we know for sure that

they saw us did we see them see us see

them

what are the when they came through the

double door I'm unclear the dwarf had a

big helmet on with just eye holes as he

was pulling the doors open the goblins

were kind of in the dark Paul beyond I

think I'm going to I'm gonna hold action

as well and just kind of stay hidden

but my action that I'm holding is to

jump out and make myself known and try

to like talk my way out of it okay so

we're not we're not we're not killing

I'm hiding paltin Ashley are we not

killing we're not fighting

they told me not to stab me stabby I

doesn't make much sense to me either but

I don't know

all right paltin DF left into the

darkness

yeah that's why Allah hates things I'll

dodge it so I didn't I didn't get the

idea that they saw us unclear they

certainly didn't see you maybe you

should just go steal the fish I would

like to go try and steal the fish all

right so you're gonna go into the

darkness yeah all right I would like you

to make a perception check to blindly

move through the darkness without

hitting anything I'm invisible where

they keep where they can't see anything

oh taps page their shoulders 15 okay as

you make your way into the darkness you

do bump up against something sort of

pointy and hard might be a person with a

weapon of some kind you sort of it moves

it grunts you move aside you bump into

something else that's sort of big and

fuzzy and armored and and then you sort

of bump and slip your way through what

is a very large gang of creatures mm-hmm

do they sound like they were like

hostile and ready to fight about or yeah

like maybe they like oh well armed

sounded a fighting but yeah they're not

they don't you just sort of brush up

against them and slide through them

until you emerge from the other side of

the darkness mm-hmm and then you realize

you're in a dark unlit Hall

I can't see anything okay the dwarves in

the Goblin rites of dark mission do you

have any torches the Sun sword I'm going

to mine

do I have like a gauge of like how long

the hall is no you can't see you

know it's big because the sound mm-hmm

is sort of echoing in a way that

suggests it's its immensity I'm going to

cast faerie fire relatively far ahead of

me has to not light myself to see if

anything gets lit each object in a

20-foot cube within range

dexterity saving that will end your

invisibility because it's a

concentration spell well here I go

so you cast it if there's a creature in

the area it will be outlined even if

it's invisible and whatnot when you cast

it nothing lights up except well you do

get sort of a glimpse of the area

briefly since the glow only well you can

latch on

you can outline any creature objects and

effective creatures saved in life yes so

you kind of outline the pillars in this

hall this pillar this pillar this proxy

you probably get these three pillars in

your area of effect okay so they sort of

glow with whatever colored light you

want and there is like no there are no

creatures okay in the area and you are

now visible and there's a wall of

blackness behind you mmm where the bad

guys are but they still wouldn't see me

because I they wouldn't because they're

currently in the blackness this is where

the fish oppose me in this circle oh

you're not sure Oh didn't close and tell

us no no cousin doesn't tell us anything

thanks good thanks man you didn't ask

[Laughter]

pertinent information

[Laughter]

all just sort of left into the darkness

okay cool

same team Couzens all right we caught we

call that Poquoson exactly i mean took

Cozens credit Paul didn't stop and ask

before he dodged left in - yeah there we

go so maybe you should make a manner all

right so yeah paltin there doesn't seem

to be any imminent danger in the hall

except the big swath of creatures and

the darkness behind you just kind of

look back I'm like just start wandering

off down the hall okay and so that

brings us to chosen oh wait did I use my

bonus action no oh wait that would make

a loud sound carry on we thought about

it so cozen you've seen evil and it's

still kind of hiding out with you

waiting for her moment

d/f is in the room or it actually you

saw him disappear into the darkness

right Strix

is nearby so really just evil intense

trickster the only ones with you at the

moment dear and paulten have both left

into the darkness like I kind of walk

you he wandered onto the darkness

invisibly the darkness as I do alright

and the the dwarf and his goblin pals

they have not emerged from the darkness

yet they have not acted yet so no all

right I am going to draw my sword

okay but I'm not going to do anything

I'm just going to look alarmed and on

high alert okay then you and Strix and

evylyn can hear somebody trying to open

that door that DF jury-rigged shot with

his dagger and it sort of trembles a

little bit but is unable to be opened

hold please right yeah there's a time

for distraction for spalting went to

steal back very far away yeah yeah all

right you should you should go help

Alton steal the fish I'll distract him

here what if I don't think he knows

where the fish is Hey

all right what do you what if instead of

distracting him we let them do their

thing because the dwarf still thinks I'm

on his side so if we've got a massive

crowd of goblins coming through all

eager to kill feels like it'd be a lot

easier to convince them that they were

not being attacked by us okay so we're

going to do distraction force but with

charisma force

distraction force charisma addition plus

13 for the Asian isn't there all right

well I owe you you lead the way then

cousin all right

are you moving into the Hall cozen are

you staying hidden I wait are we hidden

are we you're looked up you were sort of

tucked in a the shadows okay in that

case I am going to storm into the

hallway okay and look ragged and out of

breath as best as I can I'm gonna stay

all right then you are there in the hall

when the dwarf and his entourage which

consists of eight goblins and four

bugbears

stomp out of the darkness into the room

yeah

and they kind of stumble in a little bit

but regain their composure and now

you're just staring them all down

all right Tim can I act yes ice cream

we're under attack you idiots like

didn't you hear the the alarm go off

Amerigo will say yeah well you left the

when you showed me to the sewers you

left the secret door open what that

wasn't me that was you look no it was

him it was not me look we can either

argue about this or and both get killed

by this a Mathare when he finds out or

you can go clean up that mess in the

sewers and I will secure things down

here

I'm the enforcement make a deception

check charisma that is that is a 14 you

can see he looks back at the bugbears

just to see what they think but then

looks toward you and says you're lying

sack of oh come on

finally someone says it yeah and I says

you're fired

kill him all right in that case I scream

charisma addition has failed kill him

[Laughter]

captured the waffle crew I just had to

come back and see the Santa thar who has

charmed me so

okay deception 18 well why didn't you

say so

I was ashamed of my love yes probably

just tucked it inside the little alcove

or the entrances it's like do you can't

see this but here's every yes just going

thank you there's no need for bloodshed

if someone will just calm down and move

toward the secret door where we can all

work together to close it

while we vacate this hallway yeah you're

not that far okay yeah

because that is the problem here is the

secret door right

being open good thing that the fish is

fine yeah I'm just like can she persuade

them to go to the secret door she's

already made a deception check yeah so

she's basically done for now but let's

see you have stayed the bad guys hand

for the moment

Amerigo orders the bug bears and goblins

not to attack and kill cozen okay grow

well evylyn is putting on her remarkable

performance that's me at which point the

door that deaath gyrate shut

disintegrates Oh

just turns to dust I knew it's only

gonna last like one round and the Zenith

our glides into the hall cool and unlike

the last time you saw the zenith are he

has got a big eye patch

covering his main eye with like four

straps wrapped around his or Bechet body

holding it in place

cool I do hold back a chuckle I'm glad

you could find some humor in this and

evil and you turn around and see the

eyes of the zenith are gazed upon you

and cozy oh me oh my

Rosanna thought and I just gesture at

her like huh I'm so glad that you

Couzens have brought me back face to

face with two eyes death what do you do

are you still just like I crafted he's

in the darkness yeah hearing all this

like I think I'm actually now things I

can't calm down I think actually I'm

gonna like kind of move off my Crouch

stealth position and just kind of like

squeak around everyone like get through

the darkness through the doorway back

into the room with cozening repulsions

oh we're pulling like into this hall

yeah so like if those doors like opened

up and I'm like here I'm like just kind

of like scooch in here like here right

past them yeah I'm trying to get I don't

think I know

Talton whatever but I'm trying to get

there so I figured yeah as soon as you

basically get out of the field of

darkness you see palton in the hall oh

because he sort of illuminated the

pillars with a fairy fire effect and so

you see are illuminated cool yeah these

three pillars dominated by your fairy

fire okay so they're still lit sweet

yeah they'll be lit until you stop

concentrating on the spell so he walks

through I was like

yeah good job hey I have no idea where

we're going

well that's okay well his anethe are

just showed up if we're gonna do is we

have to do is quickly stay with me

and then because like the restrooms like

still super dark right yeah

all right so death will basically well I

cut put hand on one of the walls and

just follow down the hallway with like

the handle on that okay

until he finds nearly a secret mm-hmm

I'm not going this yeah yeah okay the

lights doesn't extend much beyond the

these doors here there's a hallway that

goes off into darkness here okay

then there's a closed door there all

right and so stone it's a stone round

door about six seven feet in diameter

that's hinged on one side okay I don't

hear a thing on the other side at all

there's a stone okay I'll try it I'll go

through that door you push on it it

takes a fair amount of effort but you

are able to open it and you're sort of

on a raised platform with some steps

leading down to the floor of a large

circular chamber that is magically lit

good so you can see and as soon as the

door opens the light spills into the

hall lecture in paltin and so you can

see a bit more clearly cool but when you

look through even see a very it's a

large opulent audience chamber but it is

currently empty

okay and there are two other doors one

on the far side of the audience chamber

and one to the left just like you see on

the map here okay now they look like the

same kind of doors I guess through yeah

big round stone doors great alright well

they're loading in here I'll use my

cunning action to - and keep moving a

prize try the door directly across for

me okay and just like go there and same

thing like peek through see what's in it

and then do the same with the other

durable like make the perception check

he's like making all this movement I'm

watching like ya know I'll catch up

perception 21 okay as you cross the room

you notice that in addition to the doors

you can see there is a secret door in

the floor hmm

but you nearly stepped on oh and it's

just a stone square shaped door it looks

like it might push open I was like a

trapdoor

come on check that one too so you stop

yeah from the audience chamber though

take note yeah it's in the floor of the

audience chamber it's like right about

there oh oh man

okay so tempting for a little robe so

you stop you pause yeah you notice it

it's the seams okay in the floor alright

I can't help myself

I fired a high to finish somewhere safe

we'd be here alright so you want to try

to open that door then nice alright try

stopping your weight both feet alright

so you'll need to make a strength

athletics check well oh 17 you succeed

great and as you push it open you can

see that there is a wooden ladder

underneath it that descends down to what

appears to be a lower level oh my god

okay

I'm just gonna leave that there for now

like I still want to check the other

doors okay just I want to know all my

options first yeah okay so you're

basically done at this point

yeah strix wow you're still in the room

left alone and the behold the beholder

says well

because egg you know me I'm just faster

than I expected

I have other company good Oh will it be

rude not to introduce me to your guests

evylyn stop trying to stall as much as

possible so she's like etiquette

dictates that you would make a full

intern into one rat right polymorph

yourself into a rat that's a yeah like

yes yeah I can polymorph myself to do a

rat okay okay I feel like he's not going

to hurt even one he's already made that

very very clear yes and there's a brief

exchange going on right now in fact

we're okay so I will polymorph myself

into one rat and he says to me he says

something to the evil into the effect of

well you didn't have time to clean I can

stand here and close my eyes if you need

a moment or a few moments and I'll just

I'll just like scurry along the edge of

the wall and just like try and yeah try

and find these guys all right just make

a stealth check I'm gonna give you

advantage cuz I'm a rat yep please ten

okay as you sort of stealth your way

along a year you're you think you're

being as sneaky as you can right she

always does a little and and you you

creep along the wall

I do rat things yes and then the zennith

are horrified that evylyn would think

this place is infested with rats fires

the disintegrates right can't even react

and jump in front of it uh does evylyn

even know that it's tricks it's not a

crane it's just a rat wouldn't even have

some sort of yeah evil and you can see

when there's an authority

horrified that you might even see that

this place is infested with rats you

sort of you see its reaction you look

back and you see Strix creeping on the

wall I go shield first right in front of

it all right no then it will hit

automatically and I need you why did you

I could just let me die to roll a

dexterity same 800 15 okay not enough

more fun watching a suffer in person

everyone do you enjoy this

so you leap into the path of the rat and

you take 52 points of damage you're okay

ow I like animals can can I like

absolutely say something I would say uh

view of my Lords an ATAR permit me to

handle this rat so that you can comment

bare your guests the rack just because

if you see the rat sort of going through

the darkness don't hurt it I like

animals

ow she lays down on the ground and she's

like oh oh that centration I'll try to

seem I'll say like you know so as to

avoid any unpleasant tree let me just go

take care of this rat dark I think I

need medical attention

alright so the darkness disappeared when

Strix became a rat so you do see the

rats scuttling after and then

does Anna Tharsis well if it doesn't

bother you no but I don't feel very good

now and I just I need some I think I

need medical attention I think all the

focus should stay on me right now as

your guest the others the beholder said

Wow I just just said I'm hurting and

your first thought is someone else he's

turning on the eyes turn on you Couzens

and he is anitha's I told you yes but

you indicated that Evelyn Evelyn was

highest on your priority list I saw an

opportunity to bring her down here

independent of all of them if you just

give me a little bit I will get right

back to work on the uppers your one

failed me for the last time this is the

first time I would like you to make two

saving throws Oh first first one is a

dexterity saving throw alright one

second here the boss is mad why did I

thought that maybe you care that I was

hurting but apparently not yeah well I'm

starting to see why no one comes to

visit museums are the first 112 okay so

you are hit by a black crackling Rey

awesome awesome

oops even might have reacted by jumping

in front of it but she's sprawled out on

the floor it's already used a reaction

alright it does 55 points of necrotic

damage alright well your boy cozen is

hanging in there and and then it's a

second ray will require a a strength

saving throw oh good oh good

[Music]

17 okay that one you're actually able to

avoid and it looked like it was trying

to sort of telekinetically propel you

okay but you resist it

alright well and then it is Bolton's

tournament I am out of you though oh yes

okay cool I will even follow death into

the room if you want I would love to

honor that you see death has opened up a

trapdoor in the floor love articulatory

do yes I know how much you like secrets

we need to look over every other option

first give nas and points to their doors

and ssq to check them there's the door

closes doors here okay I'll check that

door okay when you open that door only

in quiet and you look beyond you see a

giant fish bowl with and it's about 15

feet away in a strangely shaped room and

inside the fishbowl is like a miniature

coral reef and a miniature sunken ship

like a gallium and next to that is a

small table outside of the fishbowl on

the floor with a smaller fish bowl

inside it that is empty that's because

of the fish the golden fish susana stars

golden fish is swimming around in the

big tank amid the wreck of the ship what
