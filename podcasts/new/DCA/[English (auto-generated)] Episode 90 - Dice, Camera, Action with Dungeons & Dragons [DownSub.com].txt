[Music]

buddy welcome to diced camera action

dandy game where people cry a lot and

it's real no seriously we are at the end

of season three this is our season three

finale and welcome Jerry Hawkins to our

fun little game yay mom when I am NOT I

am NOT in my usual digs I'm not a wizard

of the coast I'm on I'm in Burbank

California so that's why my surroundings

look bizarre and my computer my internet

connection was not great so I'm actually

doing this over my phone oh that's level

yeah we have further ado let me do let

me paint a picture of where we've been

and set a course for where we're going

the waffle crew went into the shadow

fell to rescue their companion paulten

then succeeded and emerged in the lair

of three hags and a deal was struck with

these hacks in exchange for some body

parts from Strix and D at and palton the

hags would give them a scroll of

Resurrection and a what else strim escas

book sham and missile DOCSIS and a pair

of spectacles from on Arkana lost named

mr. Fox and the deal was done the items

were traded the waffle crew got the hags

the kind of turn and fight each other

creating a distraction for them to slip

away before Strix made the worst deal of

her life a second deal involving

possibly giving birth to a hag child

wait wait wait wait no she didn't agree

to that

did she well she didn't agree to it no

you got away each other way before Strix

could commit herself to that okay

God she also got this agree to it

whoa whoa whoa chill she she was she was

interested but

was having none of it crammed Chris

quick yeah what are you what type of

stuff do you guys get up to on this game

welcome to our world you live in heaven

we live in hell but a single stanza have

you ever heard of like a whipping boy

you know you know how he plays

acquisitions incorporated everyone has

just a jolly old fun time yeah we're the

we actually heard he talks about the

aggression we have the opposite of a

whipping boy on our game so well I'm

whipping boy yeah yeah so the sad part

is we're never gonna see the parallel

universe waffle crew campaign with hag

child strikes running around but you

know never known him at all we can't

have it all but there is one party

member missing that being evil in who

sacrificed herself nobly after she was

trapped in the soul monger her spirit

now resting comfortably in heaven and

before we jump in today's action and I'd

be remiss if I didn't mention that there

is a second waffle crew running around

in the very city where the waffle crew

currently finds itself port nigh and

Zara this other waffle crew where it was

created from body parts given to the

hags previously they've created these

evil clones and had them running around

basically capturing people in a black

sack for the hags to twist into evil or

to devour so there are two waffle crews

running around port and ions I remove

but before we get to their really really

bad ones let's start off with the three

surviving good ones and they're al bear

companion waffles who are back in Port

lions are this tropical City on the

shores of chunks and they're surrounded

by this these myriad colors and this

panoply of activity all these people

hustling and bustling around going about

their daily lives the city is enclosed

by tall walls to keep the dangers of the

jungles out of child and the place is

alive with music voices screams shouts

sounds dropping dinosaurs and other

beasts

d/f you haven't your possession these

spectacles they were stolen from you by

a little girl whom you rescued from the

hags now she is running away from you

pell-mell through the crowded streets

with the stolen spectacles in her grasp

that's right and there is no way that

she is ever faster than I am so I am

chasing her down cunning action - -

however as I need a deer to get caught

way up in there so that I can get my

grasses back so do you if you were the

only one who noticed she had stolen the

glasses do you want to say anything to

your friends before you dart away after

her yeah uh basically are they they just

see deer look down will quick look back

up and dart off and Olli here is that's

what you hear Strix and palton did she

just take the glasses I don't know he's

just see like dances beating cheeks

yes and yeah certainly has the speed on

her she has the small size that lets her

basically run under things like pollen

cans and through the legs of taller folk

and it's a real cool chase I'm like

bolting over crates and barrels yeah

like being like swiftly ducking in

between around people as I'm chasing

down this little girl it's very

impressive looking I swear all right I

would like you to make a grapple roll

that's a strength athletics check do I

get advantage because she's for whatever

and she's she's a slippery street urchin

type so you know right you just be

embarrassing if I can't out strength a

little girl but thankfully I did roll an

18 just flat me today alright you grab

her all right good and as soon as you do

she screams very very loudly and all

these people turned to you and she's

kicking and flailing you and calling you

a thief

and a child beater oh do I see the

spectacles in your possession

yeah she's she still got them all right

I would like to take them from her okay

make a you know you can actually so you

want to do it in such a way that you're

not gonna break them so make a

sleight-of-hand okay well thankfully I

can do that quite well unless unless

knowing my luck oh no that's great

thirty-two okay you have no trouble

snatching the spectacles from where and

now just make a perception check and

actually Strix and paltin you can make

the perception check as well all right I

was on the way over to where the kid was

whoever deaath win if I could that was a

natural for my dice are on fire I got 29

card Walton to see what's going on

through the bottom of his and but deaath

you're the one who sees that the girls

antics have attracted the attention of a

very big bulky portal a turtle man with

a big shell comes over to you and taps

you on the shoulder with one of his

turtle fingers and says I don't think

that what you're doing is very nice so

after I retrieved the spectacles I uh

how much money do I have left on me you

would know it's that's not a lot so

after we treated spectacles I like I

well set the girl down and then I looked

at the turtle and says he stole my

mother spectacles i broom over there by

this point yeah air smoke billowing from

the back of your broom a nobody is

looking at you sorry well I don't far

did she uh I want to hand her a highest

coin in my possession which I think I

have at least a gold piece

I want to hand her a gold piece and just

uh to her like almost like kneeling down

to her giving her the quarry and I want

to say to her there are better ways to

survive and give her the coin those are

worth 25 times this might have my

godness

it makes me donate what you say have I

gotten over there yet how far did she

even get so you're kind of clueless for

a minute because you failed your

perception checks so spectacularly and

then there's a big cloud of smoke when

Strix took off in front of you re but as

you come through the smoke and you

stagger over you can see that palton is

down on one knee talking to this little

girl holding up with all peace in front

of her she's just got her hands on her

hips shaking her head and there's this

big total looming over them both paulsen

help is there with kids

Moulton also has money I'm gonna lean

down to the little girl and just be like

Oh am I gonna be like I'm gonna tell her

like it's like you remember in like

little little one you remember you

remember our deal right you find the

glasses and give them to us and then you

go home and then you get your supercool

reward I'm going to use suggestion on

earth right disadvantage Turin great

disadvantage because she's Pete right

yeah cuz she's a stupid kid kid believe

anything hey I've known eight-year-olds

who's gonna have Fox me so I'm not gonna

I'm not gonna be it's not gonna count

that as advantage but I am going to just

check the spell for a minute here well

we are grown adults and we have troubles

up boxing you so yeah okay yeah so you

don't have to do any sort of wild

gestures to cast the spell it's just

mostly verbal so she makes a saving

throw and she says you're right

silly me and walks off then she turns

back round takes the coin out of

dad's hand and run and heads off with it

just like ah that's right the deal that

we totally planned out with consent from

said little girl who was screaming went

through without a hitch is everyone cool

with that or we call her a saint the

turtle turns to you paltin and says I

think you handled that pretty well oh my

god talking turtle we met a talking

turtle remember I remember yelling a

stood like oh that was real

oh there's two talking Turtles Thank You

Paulding you really saved my hide just

now anyone now that's tricks that you

want to do anymore when you see palton

uses no I would just like to look

depressed okay

are you still flying are you gonna blow

land next I'll land next next to them

all right a bunch of strangers come up

to you and ask you if you're the one who

won that dinosaur race at this point she

goes no I do

Jim dark magic wanted I can't even do

magic anymore and my friends won't let

me help them and she doesn't look sad

okay they sort of look at each other and

just sort of sashay away

it's like one of those really awkward

times when like you're in public and

like you get into an argument and like

she's but she's arguing with herself and

so everyone like in the coffee shop is

just like that's pretty much what

happens here yeah so the three of you

again are left waffles will just sort of

come sauntering up behind you and the

turtle is still there and he says well I

thought that that groom was very

impressive Thank You turtle man who is

one of many because you're a race good

day now can I just give him a hug for no

reason

sure okay I do that and he'll he'll

actually hug you

oh yay and you start of Pat's you on the

back and he says they are there he

reminds me of SOPA I needed a hug she

cries a little Diaz has actually taken

aback by that a little bit because he

knows hugs aren't something that strix

gives out freely maybe when she's

depressed she dies because she can't do

magic and her friends don't want her

help even if it was a hag baby well my

work here is done

he didn't do anything

thank you sir I appreciate everything

have a nice day now

think thank you and he walks off and he

sort of stop he goes over to a wall he

picks up a fishing pole and then from

those walking off okay into the crowd so

the three of you are again together

you've got all of your items once more

in your possession strix it wasn't that

I didn't want your help

I just it was a bad deal and it would

have hurt you really badly I was just

trying to make sure you were safe she's

just like I'm strong enough to be safe

on my own I was alone for fifty years

I know I know you are listen look just

the scroll do you still have that oh I

think it's really big Pauline you said

the scroll on you do I yeah I gave it to

you so totally here look at that great

okay so we need to find someone who can

actually use that and during that time

strict I have something very important

for you to do and only you can do it why

you know magic you are magic we have

some mesh cos book I want you to read it

and learn everything you can can i what

about me and paltin Paulson's better at

it than I am

no you're not and you have the power of

knowledge

you cannot learn from this book I'm not

reading she thinks I'm in and she's like

yeah he probably won't read nah man I

would like sparknotes at at best my dude

you should probably like go in on it

well told us look at you Paul's gonna be

like well maybe once I learn it we can

talk about it sure you forget it magic -

and I want to be better I was better at

magic because I had a I had assistance

a little a little while ago and it was

it was not ideal

look Paul's good at a lot of things and

I'm sure someday I'll he'll be able to

help the both of us but right now we

need to some time and we need evil I'm

back what are some day I hoped you just

now it starts it starts right out of the

blue absolutely pouring rain it's kind

of sandy and gold and people start to

dart for awnings or under sails

there are also rain catchers in the

middle of town squares which have big

sales to catch water they start to

gather under those and some of them

actually have umbrellas that they pop

out but you're there standing in the

middle of the rain is there a notable

restaurant or tavern kind of setting

nearby that we can clearly just easily

get ourselves to before we get too wet

and muddy not super close but you can

just walk a little ways down to where

you heard a lot of the hustle and bustle

and once you get down in that direction

yes you do find lots of little play off

to the sides where you can duck in where

they actually serve food okay Rick's

would like to just stand there in the

rain like that gif of the doctor

standing in the rain looking really sad

for a while it's just yeah I told her

clothes until her clothes weigh twice as

much as exactly and she camp she becomes

encumbered and loses half her walk to

the inn okay so you're all inside you

shake off your hat great Halton empties

the water out of his loot to be end up

at a an inn or a tavern or places like I

say essentially

it's just a kind of like a deli okay

there are some dead snakes hanging in

the window and there's somebody

filleting some snakes on the counter and

then you can see some other things some

bread as well as some sausage and other

things behind the god great okay

we can actually get ourselves some fresh

food as well yeah said okay Paul can we

use some of the money for that oh I have

I have an idea I'm gonna Oh is there

someone like at the deli like oh yeah

okay I'm gonna ask him so what kind of

what what foods like right in front of

me like what looks just what's the first

thing that catches my eye that looks

like most appealing a meat pie a meat

pie I say good good friends is it assert

as it look like a sir

good madam not to assume but how much

for one of these lovely meat pies to tip

letting bad actually oh yeah yeah and

I'd turned it I'm like yeah you know

what that's easier than plan a song so

[Laughter]

all right let's get some meat pies just

out of curiosity what Spartans threshold

they're like is it three copper when

does it become so expensive that he

tries to play the music instead I think

if it were like I think I don't know

actually because I wasn't sure with the

expect I was expecting if it were just

like Oh like two gold for a pie I'll be

like alright let's let's let's play a

little let's play a jingle but yeah no

we're good

that's fine that's totally as strix is

basically ringing her hats yeah they

crumpled up piece of paper fault

well it wasn't coupled until you

wrinkled it up button but it falls out

of your hats and lands at your feet oh

and I pick all pick it

and look at it alright you you recognize

the icon the emblem the letterhead as

belonging to acquisitions incorporated

oh I don't is the rest of my is the rest

of my where's everyone else when I see

that we're picking out meat pies right

now yeah they're staring at the new

price and waffles waffles is waiting

outside the door because she's trained

not to go into shops and just Stampede

around right old we should get something

for she's sort of tapping the paws

expectantly Oh going like this yeah yeah

I believe I know what this letter says

and I'm guessing that it says that we

could get help from omen and that lovely

writing it suggests she might be

available and might might waive the fee

and potentially waive this right well

Strix is gonna like scribble an answer

on the back of the Hat like very hastily

and it makes sure it makes sure's to

also say that it's her fault

that Simon and evylyn are dead she

thinks all of this is her fault and she

just looks very fat and is like of

course it's put a mailbox in my hat

that's so stupid

it's just like crams our back into the

hat as you do that as you do cram it

back into the hat you can see that there

are two old women who are just sort of

been watching you the whole time just

with disapproving looks like you're

almost like you're some rats that sort

of crawled in here and decided to just

park itself on the mat she doesn't look

sad when she's like bye Goff and she

just like they get really scared and

they sort of turn inward toward each

other almost for protection not perfect

both of those letters you can check the

Twitter's on Holly and Jerry's Twitter

you can see the actual letter it's true

but I changed it to her hat being the

messenger but that's fine

she just crams it back into her hat okay

you stuff it back into your hats you

throw your hat back up on your head and

all tonight the other still faulting the

death are still

meat pies Ollie shop I'm gonna be like

so um what period I think how to phrase

it I have a a child allergy or their

child's in these meat pies I'm just

saying

we'll run up what if she hears that and

like stick a finger in it taste and be

like nah there's no kids in here okay

cool

it's like yeah well yeah I guess we'll

buy the one that had a high me upset

before you take the money she's sort of

stares like maybe something got lost in

translation like she didn't really fully

understand what you were asking so you

spend the next ten seconds trying to

clarify that you do actually mean

children you know when you are there any

like children nearby like walking around

only only outside not some they're

basically kind of running around in the

rain I just point to them it's like do

you put those in these no okay great

just needed to clarify thank you you're

buying how many of them for me pies

please or meat pump for each of us in

for waffles

there we go never getting one idea

they'll take one out two waffles okay

put on the ground so she can just yeah

good of town Nick she eats it basically

almost in a gulp yeah strikes we'll go

sit outside and eat it because she

doesn't think that the people in there

want her because the ladies were mean

yeah actually next to the building you

don't have to make an insight check to

realize that you're this scary tiefling

woman dressed all in tattered black and

you probably smell bad and they're

little moths or flies swarming around

you so yeah they're not terribly

disappointed that you leave I'm sure

Jesus outs like crying into her pie

okay now Jerry yes Chris how would you

expect strix is mad missive to arrive at

you let's see um let's see I've just now

gotten back home my suspicion is I would

probably arrive via

a an intern okay

yes the intern hands you this kind of

damp topping sheet of paper with your

letterhead on the one side green ink

bleeding all over the other and tears

it's okay you can't play tell like it is

at a certain point yeah yeah so oh yeah

you actually rather disappointed that

the intern did not bother to dry it out

first

oh yeah X Center so I take a I take a

peek at this and I am ready to move

having having very recently been

rendered assistance above and beyond the

call of duty I mean it's very rude

whenever I call upon her mom I

I hate to admit it but I think that I

probably feel like the scales are not

quite balanced right now yeah now she

did not do you to the service of telling

you where she is no of course not

[Laughter]

so you're gonna have to probably take

the probably have to perform some sort

of spell possibly a definition or

something commune with the gods as it

were to find out where she might be

yeah absolutely wouldn't my suspicion is

it would not be difficult as a cleric of

ninth level to take advantage of the

services at a temple of time Laura I

indeed I suspect this sort of thing is

incredibly common it's like a clerical

thing brain so to speak right and the

nature of your contract is such that you

can easily get to her and she can get to

you just by the infernal summons yeah

but yes so if you want to go to the

temple you can use your influence there

to have them cast basically a divination

spell yeah they can tell you that she is

in Porton ions are a city with which you

are

the acquainted oh yeah I have some

experience with the place yes

but heard permissive gives me the

impression that she is an Nisa fistic

ated you know hopefully instantaneous

aid yes err at least two dead there are

these two dead people according to her

missive yeah and there's a there is a

jolt is a long ways away it sure is

so I need I need help of a Wizarding

kind I suspect I actually need to get

something in the way and something in

the vein of a teleport type spell and a

major city like that I would suspect

would not be outside the realm correct

it would not be and well you could just

go to gym but you do you think that

actually he has not yet there's no

forgiveness yet it's just a period of

time it's like and the fact the matter

is is that I don't I can't 100%

guarantee that I would go to the correct

place I would go to there as much so I

would end up at a place that he thought

was cool which is different from where I

need to be it's not even clear that he

even knows the teleport spell no yeah

but you again using your influence not

within the temple but as a masked lord

indeed you can secure the services of

one Vajra safar the black staff of

Waterdeep ah and she I'm a mage tower I

said this eminent I try to set this up

as fast as I can

yes well she will she will see you at

once

and she will cast the spell teleporting

herself and you news report and ions are

the question only in her mind is where

you would like to appear specifically

let's see I need like a Sherlock type

thing where it's like I'm gonna look at

the letter and then like some words are

gonna be like super over it I'm trying

I'm going back I'm trying to

think of where this was I know that they

were affiliated I know they had to

manage something relatively

sophisticated with they have their own

issues with the sole monger I know that

but I don't think I'd be very surprised

if they were still in the chamber um can

we can we do a ascending oh yes

yes you can I'm gonna do ascending queue

Strix

so that I can try to find out exactly

where we need to go all right you have

22 words you can send an ascending I

believe or maybe it's 25 let me double

check that has no idea where she is so

specific it's aimed its medieval Twitter

magic Twitter but magic gonna increase

the word limit and divination spells

please 25 words you get two and she can

respond in kind

okay let's say strings where exactly are

you

I don't want to teleport into a hole

[Laughter]

unless you are in a hole how does this

work - to a voice in her head yes it's

like it's like you're a telepathic voice

in your head she looks back to see if

anyone her inner party heard it mostly

Tia

you're looking really nervously and then

she'll just like plug your ears talk to

herself you're like yeah yeah she looks

to where she is like wherever like

whatever the N is called and says like

I'm at be like what what is this at the

fried snake place yeah you're at you're

at Sebata snake pies I'm at Sabattus

snake pies outside crying with the owl

bear

I want to do a second sending but it's

just forward gross III indicate I

indicate the locale that were intended

to go to okay

bhadram knows it she's been there she

has habits me loves these pies give up

yeah yeah just running low so it works

out yeah exactly

oh one more pie all right

moments later two figures appear very

very close to Strix paltin MDF oh man

how would you describe yourself in your

current state are you wearing your armor

and blah blah blah

absolutely I came I came dressed for

whatever scenario is happening here

dressed for adventuring success exactly

and I've been out and about today you

know in my you know functionally

speaking in my guys as mask lord like I

mean I look like the sort of person you

want to do a favor for alright so all of

his armor has been neatly polished it's

when you arrive home and you realize you

may have miscalculated slightly that

wearing the heavy metal armor in a

tropical City oh yeah I remember but it

you when you appear you appear in rain

and the rain is nice and cool upon you

from cease tricks all stopping and wet

standing next to you don't know

particularly well and an owl there and

he is with a youngish maybe 30-something

woman she is black she is slight but has

a presence to her that suggests almost

nobility her bearing is so great and her

grace is so tremendous but look in her

hand a big tall almost like obsidian

black staff yeah when Strix sees omen

she's like it's my boss and then she

looks over to the black staff and is

like I know what that is

wow she's like kind of fangirling a

little bit which like I'm sure if evil

and was there she would love

you still dead upon his appearance

whatever meat pie death was holding he

just drops and then after a beat

immediately dashes over to Strix and

places himself between Strix and Ullman

and is clearly just fuming with rage

Paulding sees this and he just kind of

like oh he like takes house or like are

we doing alright when you do that you

see vajra just sort of tips her staff

toward the sword and it rusts away

omen just shakes his head no a twig

sword though is all - like typical walk

it wasn't the Sun sword no nothing to

rust self resting you just like well be

even if I try I'm not winning yeah this

is my party but she's actually waving

from behind angry dear

like Hello yeah points down and I'm just

like this is death and Paulson's over

there with the Broken Sword

uh yeah I say if I've never heard of him

listen where is this body I can do this

for you

I mean I can do this for you in minutes

wait to come and resurrect Simon and

evil in what yeah yeah you need to keep

up I'm sorry

oh no it's not on you at all I think

that I've my suspicions having only met

him is that he doesn't keep up with a

lot so and that's just I keep up with

everything

OMM drawn I know exactly who you are I

know exactly the kind of person that you

are and

last thing that we are going to do is Oh

anything else to you you've already

taken enough oh listen

there's always under rats alright this

pile of rats we're Strix used to be just

sort of hangs there for a bit in the

Strix like shape and then collapses into

a mass on the ground

Paulding looks tome and he's like what

you're talking about him right he points

it to yet I guess all right carry on the

rats all at coalesce underneath these

feet like a puddle some are just gonna

climb on his feet yes I say it listen I

can tell that there's gonna be an issue

and that's fine I'm here to provide a

service that I am authorized to do as a

result of my rank in the Church of Holy

Tamura I was called here specifically by

your friend or whatever she is to you

here because you're acting like it's

your girlfriend or something no she's

not my girlfriend no hmm I'm just I'm

just that's my read on the situation

like that's if you're if I'm wrong you

tell me it's a fair read though right I

do not look at him but I put the hand up

for the high five there yeah yeah okay

good I'm glad I'm not the only one I

just you there is I don't know I don't

know if it's going both ways but there's

definitely something going like from him

like down to these rats all of the rats

are looking up at omen with their mouths

open yes I kneel down and I space tricks

this look this is not constructive okay

seriously I can do this for you ten

minutes and out like you just pile up

the bodies I'll do my stuff you hand me

some gems we're out of here and from

what in return what more are you gonna

possibly take from us it is very very

rare that I continue

talking to a person who has annoyed me

as much as you have already and it has

been like five minutes so let's conclude

our business here paltin takes out after

saying that paltin takes out his

bagpipes and makes like a hey listen

listen sorry Doris it's like this okay I

owe her do you understand what I'm

saying I don't owe anybody and I owe her

let me do my work

but I know most about you is you don't

do anything without a price the price

has already been paid I'll tell you

about it sometime I'm a man that that

sounds fine I mean it's good right uh

strikes come back to need your words

Bajoran walks off and goes into the meat

pie shop smart

what cuz she's got to restock yeah

all right well Strix will coalesce back

into Strix and just like very

suspiciously I death and omen and I'll

hand

oh man the scroll well nope Alton has

this girl yeah I have the scroll and but

who has the parts of evylyn I'm looking

around I'm like do you want me to

resurrect one of these snakes no no not

the snakes no please there's enough

snakes here hence tricks is like I'm

sorry I'm sorry do you please don't be

mad please and she looks at omen she's

like also please don't be mad but don't

no one be mad and she just like takes a

wherever the parts of evil and in Simon

are she was like arrange them on the

ground yeah outside the restaurant

outside the restaurant in the rain in

the rain yeah she starts to unpack what

is what looks like to omen to be a burnt

wooden and metal puppet or manikin about

three feet tall he went hard with

charred black clown clothes or just her

clothes or something and that seems to

be mostly intact which is very very

badly scorched and then she starts to

unpack what appear to be metal pieces of

some sort of woman robot with golden

with golden parts of pieces of armor a

golden torso arms legs feet hands ahead

so no no bodies well we have these at

all she has no fun at all

well just like yeah we're into some kind

of weird but she's like we have her

soul in these two

like D F and I both have one that's

right maybe I'll look at but this is her

this was a a being oh man

fine I nod and then I kneel down over

these this shrapnel that they're higher

it'll live the road rearrange it into a

body shape yeah so yeah this is like

some bones type stuff and I mean like

human bones I mean like this show yeah

um

Chris yeah do I do I think that it would

even work I mean III have some idea

about different types of shells and

different types of otamatone and golems

and things like that would raise dead

even work so first of all it can't have

been dead longer than 10 days you know

that if it's rinsed it well

the creatures soul must be willing and

at a Liberty to rejoin the body okay um

[Music]

let's see it so if the spell closes all

mortal wounds but it doesn't restore

missing body parts but it looks like

they pretty much collected everything

that's nice so that I see you know I

congratulate anything I congratulate

them on that I say now it doesn't say

that it has to be a flesh it general has

to have been the creatures body it has

to be its body and the soul has to be

willing to return correct but this is

definitely not the right place no this

is we usually do everything in the

street I say you don't want to do this

in the street and you don't want anyone

to see me doing this in the street how

did they die if you don't mind my saying

it was my fault

I burned Simon to death and even died

because I didn't I didn't heal her and

then she was torn apart by this monster

that we'd never seen before that had a

giant like squid beak holes and it was

really

I hope you never meet one just saying oh

yeah you know yeah I am well I've

certainly never seen anything like that

and I never see point in time line as

you're talking a group of soldiers in

sort of diaphanous robes with just sort

of scant pieces of armor on them almost

looks more ceremonial than practical

come toward you and they seem to make a

beeline right for you me personally you

all okay I go invisible

Alton goes invisible and now kind of

looks like this

bubble in the rain I just look for her I

just look for the black staff I'm just

like I step under like an awning or

something she she knows she knows big

magic whatever bad thing she can protect

us all right these eight guards come

over to you and you can see actually to

one side of them and just a little bit

behind the leading ones is what appears

to be just the citizen who kind of

points you out and as the guards advance

the lead one says stop put down your

weapons we don't need this we weren't we

weren't doing anything

put your weapons down on the ground but

uh do we recognize these soldiers at all

no don't look like they're port minds

aru they they're definitely from port

lions are me is this citizen missing an

eye i Chris this particular citizen is

not but you do you do see that he looks

a little bit banged up and actually

there is a part of his chemise is his

vest and shirt is burnt and he points

and says she

is the one she's the one on the dinosaur

who set us all on fire and then he is

the one who took her pointing it

together

well the guard say you are all under

arrest

I didn't take first off and Trixie and

Bernie won right I mean not in the past

24 hours right

we've only just recently arrived to port

and I on Zara

who who's pointing all this out who's

pointing at us is it Earth there are

eight there there is a a man with eight

guards there they're like following the

man's lead though yeah he is pointing

you out to them yes but as as you are

standing there and these guards advance

you can see some guards up on the high

walls that are not too far away also

kind of take an interest in you and then

a couple more of 49-0 citizens are like

yeah that's her oh god put my hands up

and I say listen you cannot possibly

want me i teleported here from Waterdeep

about seven minutes ago i'd be more than

happy to introduce you to my wizard who

is currently securing me by certainly

you are welcome to a meat pie also i

under under what pretext so this is a

this person is a complete stranger to me

as you do that they just sort of put

their hands all over you omen and start

to assure you away to where you have no

idea they are they're sort of forcibly

removing you from this intersection

where you find yourself and then they

attempt to do the same thing with DF and

strace welcome to the waffle kou yeah

thanks guys

No and then a few of them hold waffles

at spearpoint

oh no no don't you touch my baby and

they walk back towards waffles okay and

I'm just kind of holding my hands up

and then I'll turn waffles into a cloud

Oh with the gaseous form mm-hmm all

right she will turn gaseous and now

there is a gaseous albear sort of

hanging around you kind of I've trained

her to be able to do that like she knows

when she's gaseous she hollow like

healed yes so strikes will be like that

wasn't a real owl bear it's just an

illusion they can sort of see this

gaseous owl bear in the in the rain

which is actually starting to peter out

now the rain is coming to a stop so

strict's you and waffles hung around for

50 years plus when you cast the spell on

her before at any time what's her usual

take on that is she's supposed to stay

with you does she run I think strikes

might have an empty potion bottle she

can go in there okay then that's what

she'll do she'll play the potion bottle

game yeah the potion bottle game which

is the locals have seen us you must look

more normal than we are okay so you

flask of waffles all right and at the

same time Strix will use all to herself

to uh oh gosh I guess just make herself

look human and normal and clean all

right

the sorcery like you haven't seen that

before

there's dinosaurs around here like just

flabbergasted like all right another in

another 12 guards come from just about

everywhere from alleys behind you all

around you so now there are 20 never

mind

that I'm just gonna gaseous form death

next oh no no but can't do that oh wait

would you say no all she's about to do

it no we can't we can't just leave evil

in here I'm gonna well I'll just sit on

the floor then

I'm gonna I'm gonna go to the guy like

say and yeah please fix this all right

you're so invisible though right I'm

still invisible yes and I'm going to I'm

gonna get up in front of them and break

invisibility and immediately try to

persuade him mm-hmm and as soon as you

appear in front of them

he shrieks like it's like you need to

listen to me wait you have you okay not

me not me personally that's a mini field

you feel serve guards grab you by the

arms and shoulders paltin and yank you

away from him

can I go invisible again

yes but they'll still have you by your

invisible arms and shoulders hold up

hold up hold up he didn't even get a

surprise persuasion no he surprised them

okay welp all right me I guess all

right we didn't do anything we just got

here who were you talking about I didn't

set anything on fire she's right

we've known jungles for months as you as

the guards are now sort of manhandling

you all and getting you out of here off

the street you haven't gotten very far

maybe a couple feet they pushed you but

evil and is still laid out on the ground

in pieces and Simon is still lying on

the ground but okay they tell they tell

you that there are that there were

numerous numerous dozens of sightings of

you setting a small market place on fire

while riding on the back of an

Allosaurus that was stolen

that's impossible we weren't here I need

to do grand theft dinosaur and this just

happened this just happened not very

long ago so this same day we were

rescued in the jungle know what it is

were they wearing our clothes yes so

there there's two girls actually me they

don't they don't say that they say that

they were wearing clothes

sort of similar style but different they

just assumed you change your clothing so

they hope you got fabulous they have me

by the arms right yes

do I need my arms to cast banishment the

guys on me so I can get it

there from this it's not hard to find

out components VSM no they didn't take

omen though like oh oh yes they're

taking home in as well what why because

he's consorting with you clearly here

I'm gonna persuade the guards that I

slept with his wife last night cuz now

I'm just pissed I can't do anything okay

nothing the road so you that's actually

a deception check okay cool

that's that's just as good okay that's

like why don't I ever roll that high 24

yes super convinced that you banged his

wife okay first thing I just rolled this

randomly first thing he tells you that

he's gay he doesn't have a wife you know

he has a husband think about it so stop

lying okay

roasted her I'm so sorry I should not

have assumed you know that's on me

that's all on me ah I look forward to

wherever it is you're taking us yes so

when they're trying to move me away yeah

like I mean I know perfectly well

independent of everything else I don't

know these people and I never did right

thanks

but no I'm talking about the people who

are laid out oh yeah now like everything

that they are doing is so violently

opposed to my sensibilities as a cleric

mmm-hmm I tell them I say we will

with you and we won't do any more tricks

Strix but you we're not moving another

foot until I have a chance to gather

these remains in a way that honors them

and if you if you think this is gonna go

another way i flash my sai flash my holy

symbol and i say i'm a cleric of luck

so think about I think about how it's

gonna go for you okay you can make

either a persuasion or intimidation as

you see fit

okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do so I'm gonna

use the intimidation it's they're

they're both the same but I'm gonna use

intimidation just to give it that extra

monastic sort of ain't edge that is a 23

all right he says he's a little bit

confused because he doesn't understand

why you play such import on what are

clearly broken pieces of metal and a

burnt hunk of wood but the weight of

your words does stick and as that holy

symbol gleams in his eyes he just sort

of gives you a nod like okay fine so I

gather them up in the way that is

appropriate I mean obviously referencing

the cardinal directions as I bring the

fabric up on each side and like no joke

I'd do it in a sacred way Strix is

impressed but was also really close to

casting

twin damn an animate object on both of

them again but as she sees them wrap it

up she's like all right so you gather

them all up mm-hmm and I entrust I

entrust them each to one person

so Strix and D if it seems like they

have the it seems like they're the

emotional core okay they will after you

gather thing up the guards will start to

parade you away and they'll take you

through town you're just surrounded by

these guards and they really are quite a

majestic crew Portman's our room doesn't

cut corner

when it comes to decor decorum and pomp

and circumstance these guys are decked

out but obviously for the climate some

of them have shields of beautifully

painted dinosaur hide but some of them

are just carrying big tall Spears and as

they lead you through town other people

begin sort of whispering at you and

going at you occasionally one somebody

might throw a piece of fruit toward you

but it's sort of badly aimed and doesn't

come anywhere near you no I take those

you pick those up as you can thank you I

was hungry and you start to make your

way around of the plateaus within the

city walls where the rich have their

estates perched on top and you kind of

walk under this bridge and like you all

to make perception checks oh I can do

that 24:47 hey I got a 6 ok 24 and 27 is

going to do it on the bridge which is

this stone bridge that connects two of

these plateaus and you're walking

underneath the bridge and this bridge is

about maybe a hundred feet long and

about 40 feet high and it's arched and

it's ornate and it's got these pennants

hanging from it and this beautiful

statuary perched along it

there are even little statues of

dangling monkeys underneath it just sort

of hanging there these pieces of stone

but as you walk under this breathtaking

piece of architecture you see glaring

down at you from the top of the bridge

palton with sort of longus black hair

and a high collar

you see Strix kind of perched on the

like a feral cat and a version of DF

with all this hair sort of hanging down

in his face which he flips oh my god

does the hair as the water spray off of

it and like a snow cuts this single

strand still falls right in front of the

eye afterwards yeah and he's got a sort

of knowing sneer and it kicks up his

skateboard so yeah they are like many

people in the city now looking down at

you with great interest and surprise as

I see that penneth practically face

palms at the realization and just goes

saw son of a and then they all

come oh they're all looking down at you

and then they all kind of turn back for

an instant and look behind them and then

a fourth figure joins them and you see

that this figure appears to be a

bejeweled metal clad or possibly even

metal woman familiar ring right on this

 face how else would you

describe no leave no that's not it

either okay

she hasn't revealed it yet right um I

would say that like she's made of

obsidian black metal and just encrusted

with jewels and she's got this kind of

like cloth that looks very expensive

some sort of sash fashioned with a

brooch over one shoulder and she just

kind of like she moves almost like I

don't know it's weird and eerie because

it's almost human but very uncanny

valley like very debonair kind of and

she just kind of slithers into the space

and looks down her nose at everyone but

steps in front of the of the party as

though she has some sort of ownership

over them yeah that's the clear

implication the others sort of parked

for her what do those down below do

after des revelatory

at worst I get the attention of both my

party members and their nearby guards

and people escorting us name weekly

point them out and just be like are

those were you looking for Palme looks

up he's like holy shot and at this

time Palme is you look up the clouds

part very suddenly and light shines down

upon them and straw doesn't even burst

into flames

oh no the superstrut he's got more

powerful the black lady just waves at

them menacingly oh we're lucky to be

going to jail that sounds like you know

what I agree with that all right it's

always thought of jail is kind of a

vacation just for bad things as you

point this out in the guards look up

it's very clear that they're suddenly

perplexed because they are seeing who

may in fact be the true culprits you

know we need rich above you we need

ferry fire of some way to indicate them

like because there's so many people here

like we need to specifically indicate

these these alternate versions now I've

only met them I've only known them for a

little while here I mean can I see that

they seem to have like is it apparent

even to me that they have some kind of a

doppelganger yes they look like they're

physically the same people they're just

sort of Baudette differently and they've

sort of coiffed

their hair differently and lived kind of

different lives but yeah you would say

that they are they're twins separated at

Birth doesn't work okay you said that

Mirror Universe Strix is sort of perched

like a cat yeah how far away is this

individual oh she's 40 feet up okay this

is doughnut hole person then alright let

us say that that is the action that sets

off the initiative good what's the save

DC against the hold person

save BC against my high quality products

is 16 I believe

alright so Holly you're rolling or

people's tricks for evil Strix oh yeah

she fails

okay so evil Strix goes rigid on my hope

my hope on the edge of the bridge

they're suspended by the whole person

spell and you get to make a new save at

the end of evil Strix is turn right so

let us start with the good group oh man

what was your initiative my initiative

mr. Perkins is 1818 good Strix

what's your initiative it was a 3/3

palton I actually am rolling for evil

palton first who got a nap one crazy

right weird man oh damn it there's a

role for good palton oh I'm gonna save

like 10 was embarrassing but now I don't

feel so bad that I don't I don't act no

I can I can own the net one it's fine

yeah I got a three I mean we're close I

know so I'm sorry

so paltin you're taking than that one

yes I was just being an ass okay what

was your role 10/10 okay and evil evil I

got the new dice right when I turned

evil evil palton okay now much better

six six evildea seventeen and evil Strix

six as well okay evil DF sounds like a

metal album does so evil evil in yeah

you go first you see a spell take hold

of feral Strix and she just sort of

freezes in place and you can trace that

spell back to an armored burro

a bald man who seems to be in the

company of you are more benevolent twin

does omen have outwardly displayed

symbols of Tamura on him almost

assuredly definitely she sees those and

she kind of just sneers and she's like

oh the lady of smiles oh she just makes

like gagging sounds and she surveys the

rest of them and she kind of like uh you

know like tickles awful des shoulder and

she's like you're right you are the cute

or one of the two he looks back at her

uh and just kind of like I've told you

and even kind of like kind of like puts

a hand on and rubs her a little bit

almost very affectionately and then she

just I think she just throws and oh man

just all right oh man I knew I shouldn't

use the javelin eight okay I take it an

eighth does not hit omens AC you're

gonna have to get up a little earlier in

the morning hold on that was I I act I

just that was a test which drills

another thank you

she lost both her javelins they just go

clattering off warning throws yeah all

right hi dart that let it be a lesson to

you

omen oh man you are currently have evil

Strix held what would you like to do on

your next turn now that is a

concentration spell right I'm just

double-checking I believe so

no and I say we had the same question

today yeah it's concentration up to one

minute okay is any let's see and we can

move about thirty feet so they're so

they're all they're basically all just

beyond what we can get to in a in a turn

then right yes and there's no easy way

up to the bridge from here locally that

you can see you'd have to run a few

streets over climb some stairs now there

are some buildings and things that would

get you closer or you could fly if you

have that ability

I'd uh um yeah I mean it really depends

on how we want to get the party started

here I was hoping that stunning her up

there would lead to a situation where

she might topple off naturally really

good at purging yeah I believe it but it

does require some motor function so so

we basically I think I think what I'm

going to do is I'm actually going to

spend this turn because any any action

we try to take is going to be hindered

by the twenty guards so I want to use

this turn to try to create use it you

know with my perceptional abilities or

with with my like performance persuasion

intimidate I'm just gonna draw their

attention to those but I'm gonna draw

the attention of the leader of the

guards to this group to this group of

differing of you know doppelganger yeah

you know duplicates up on the edge and

just indicate that they are the people

who they're the people who they're

actually after and I say you can see

already they've hurled two javelins from

there I assume that's a I assume that

that is a law that you're supposed to

enforce at least as well as the other

one correct they not make a percept sort

of persuasion check with advantage here

comes ooo twenty the guards all let you

guys go perfect and the guy you've been

talking to starts barking orders and

sends half his squad one direction to go

up basically heading off one side of the

bridge and sends the other squad off the

other direction so they can't get off

that bridge and he'll stay with you for

the time being and he says I am sorry I

doubted I say listen given given the

circumstances you would have been mad to

believe me he says they are wanted dead

or alive I can help okay that's omens

turn evil DF

okay so they're up on a perch looking

down at the rest of us yeah all right is

there it looks like a pure wall there

just a dropper like things in between

it's a it's basically like a suspension

bridge a stone suspension bridge there

there are some support pillars that hold

it up okay and then it sort of continues

past those pillars to different plateaus

on which the city is built this bridge

that the evil party is on is a main

thoroughfare

it's just elevated it's 40 feet higher

and crosses the lower street at

perpendicular angle all right so I'm I'm

imagining that the the awful crew were

basically lying in wait and prepared for

our appearance to show up yes in fact

that they were because evil Strix

received the sending as well Oh that'll

do it oh cool

so evildea then turns towards the

equivalent of evil evil in and turns

hard like again very very very sly place

a hand at her lower back almost just a

little too low so it's kind of reaching

below hip size Chris just a little bit

he'll turn to turn to her and just be

like I know we're doing this for shard

and everything but uh this one's for you

and he kisses her and then bolts off the

off the bridge swinging on a rope that

he already had ready it basically swings

straight down and and let's go in such a

way they can immediately engage with

deaath an attack so that's all nice

all right strictures just watching this

like what the so lighted by this

she's like it's that this swashbuckling

DF comes down is hair blowing it's big

tall boots riding high yeah comes down

swinging on the Rope that's no problem

you can do that

you just make your attack roll on

arrival all right is so like just amped

up by this spectacle he's like yeah go

dia

hold on wait it gets confused first I

get like walking him so he ones my

friend but one's hotter what do I do

all right this is Jarrod attacking

Jarrod yes

I'm trying my hardest did not my

character sheets mixed up oh yeah

so it's a thigh high boots Dias attacked

other deaath with a 19 on a short ass

okay maybe we should start calling

normal death doors just for the duration

no we're not I don't think we should now

now no very really almost yes

normal DF hasn't attacked yet this round

so I'm gonna give you a sneak attack

okay that doesn't feel good on the

receiving end okay take him yeah so evil

DF is normal death it even still ticking

surprised so even as like the first word

comes in for the pass it's a total of 14

but regular deaath undeterred by his

acrobatics still uncanny dodges and

misses most of the blade is evildea

through lance besides them and they

engage in battle so don't take seven

seven out of that business right and so

D&D out there now firmly squared off

against each other and it is good D at

Stern ah great gasps Oh see just his

normal short sword deaath unsheathed

gutter immediately almost instinctively

knowing the exact attacks that he is

doing is able to counter and our pasta

from that

there's so many layers there yes after

our cutting day uncanny dodging dodgiest

comes back with his short-sword rolls 22

which is more than enough to hit thigh

ideas but without any kind of sneak

attack or any kind of bonus on there he

gets four so I sneak attack because you

are standing amidst your allies

that's right oh well then that's no good

for you dear hold on no it's real real

bad yeah that's a lot of guys I can hear

it great it's fine

okay first total of 15 okay

which is actually a lot against evil

death there's perfect ABS evil death is

still standing

yes okay do you have any other moves or

anything else you want to do

good yes no he sings engaged with that

yeah dance doesn't feel undeterred

direct his companions at the moment

evil Strix you got a new singing throw

to try to break the hold spell oh boy

she rolled a 1 I don't know it is now

evil Paul toons turn it's pretty on

character that he's just a drink you're

up okay cool

did I miss anything crucial and fighting

death

oh yeah who's fighting people Strix

still failed her saving throw to break

the hold so she's still frozen up on the

bridge so currently you are up there

with evil evil and I'm looking down on

DF by the DF the do I see good Strix

down there oh yeah uh he's just kind of

looming over looking around spots

Drake's and be like alright

guess I'll take care of the trash and

I'm gonna cast a crowd of madness the

wisdom saving literally at PacSun

plugged Holly just went oh no and we

were like what what if this ever

happened so I guess it's your spell safe

do you see against my wisdom order I

roll you have to roll Holly and add my

wisdom I had your wisdom oh well that's

not too bad I drilled a 15 um let me see

I just left nothing okay if it's

Pleasant cuz it's a mines either 15 or

16 no it's it's 16 and it's the same as

mine so I failed Oh

at level 3 at 16 is that right

oh no your Reagan you're holy that's

right I'm looking okay damn and probably

you succeed then you pray you succeeded

yeah okay thank God

so this iron crown almost forms over

your head like novel evil poems like

yeah would have been fun though every

single one of us has a minor panic

attack all right there's always next

round okay

and so Strix it is now your turn alright

oh god I hate I hate this

this is she's also upset because this is

also her fault like I'm normally better

than this prove it

I have proved it pretty - babe can I get

because there's too many people here for

me - fireball careful spell there's way

too many people here there's no way I

can omit all of them well actually

that's not true because the guards have

dispersed okay um but I want to get the

ones on the bridge

oh I see yeah so you can't necessarily

see everybody who's on the bridge

because you're below it right okay if

you are above it you might be able to

selectively target out creatures that

you might hit accidentally cool okay um

what about you said there were snowing

monkeys on this bridge yep the underside

of the bridge has basically carvings of

stone hanging from it big ones right

good sized ones there like it's a it's a

40-foot high bridge and these are like

gorilla sized monkeys hanging underneath

okay

I would like to twin spell animate

object one two of those very good

right up now have them climb up the

bridge holy okay well the other's

tricks but I'm seeing the other Strix is

like literally right there on the edge

like that yeah yeah yeah okay so these

two stone monkeys break away from the

weather that's really cool attached

under the bridge and claw their way up

to the top so evil evil in and evil

Strix and evil paltin you see these big

two hulking stone monkeys crawl up onto

the bridge with you excuse me and

they're going to use their movement to

get up there this round hole is it not

but stone evil process alright so we

shall move on then

palton good paltin you you are at the

bottom of the initiative order yep I'm

looking at the two stone monkeys that

you're that Strix just animated go up

and harangue your friends orangutan

orangutan on the ground deaath is

fighting evil deaath that's correct

he paltin like looks at DF and looks at

evildea looks back again back again but

which one's the real one

how do I know any help no ah alright

I'll just take a guess and I will leave

it to a random guy roll oh gosh

it's like I kind of liked the other DF

he seems cool one of them's real hot

there's real bad right

there's we happen not okay no it's final

okay

I always draw I'm gonna I'm gonna try

and Sun sword evil DF all right so that

is Oh roll right yes okay what am i

adding to this cuz I never use this this

is the Sun blade finesse means I can add

decks right yeah that's correct

cool outta here you're adding your

proficiency bonus which is +4 and your

dexterity bonus to the role cool whoa

that is well 25 okay I'm alright the

stranger recoils and hisses at the Sun

sword ah

oh and you also got a +2 bonus on top of

that because of the look but the blades

magic so your damage roll is d8 must

your strength mm-hmm

+2 for the well game so plus 4 total

that is food that is 10 damage oh right

evil DF does not have uncanny dodge or

anything so just entirely engaged with

good deer in the middle of it just ugh

are glowing blade from the chest right

the middle and uh all the means in

history's like for what it's worth I

thought you were pretty cool and then an

evil DF will then fall down to his knees

and slump over all right that ends the

first round we are back to evil evil in

she shrieks when she sees awful Diaz

fall like an onion human sound

metal screech and she says cower before

evelyn of char and she cast a beware oh

[Laughter]

[Music]

my god

and she casts what fear that's 30-foot

cone upon everyone down below so a

phantasmal image of each creatures worst

fear appears if unless they succeed on a

wisdom saving throw all I could get deep

oh no go ahead

Strix omen dia and paltin uh and what's

the DC Anna I'm gonna double-check I'm

pretty sure it's real high 17 oh Jesus

whoa sorry I don't know she's telling me

what to do it's real bad oh that's a 12

so I fail miserably

yeah 17 oh dang the lady of lux shines

ago my my say my wisdom say this is not

so much no Dex that's a that's a four

okay so I'm really curious what greatest

fear phantasms appear so I'm Jared I

didn't catch your number what was it oh

that's weird I can tell there's six okay

sorry guys so this is just the fear

spell right now yeah okay so everybody

but omen is frightened and gradually was

not there and a and a creature must take

the dash action and move away from

Evelyn of Chartres by the safest

available route on each of its turns and

it gets a new saving throw at the end of

each of its terms and they have to drop

whatever they're holding and they're

dropping whatever they're holding so

gutter hook goes on the ground sorry

sorry

strictest room on the ground oh my god

paltin some sword goes on the ground and

you guys take off and run I've never

felt such Glee and sorrow at the exact

same time omen yes you are standing

there with the guard captain what do you

do so I have seen this this fear sort of

or take these new fellows yes now the

Spill magic allows me to dispel an

effect would breaking this spell the the

effect of this fear spell clear all of

them you choose one creature object or

magical effect since the spell has

already gone off and it's not sustained

you can't target the spell but you could

remove the fear effect on a creature

yeah one creature though yes that's that

that's the tricky bit right correct yeah

I feel like using I feel like clearing

Strix would be the highest dps value

purchase you certainly know what she's

capable of more than the others

absolutely oh great okay so because it's

a third level spell or lower you are

automatically successful and rend fear

effect on Strix alright good

she screams though because hey what did

she see what did she see what did she

see what was her horrible horrible super

fear oh my god I mean it would just be

probably just be being alone again like

everyone was gone like like maybe

they're all dead and like it wasn't evil

dee if it was dead it was just actual

deaath that was dead and evylyn was dead

and everyone's dead Paulson's dead a

woman's dead and then she's like oh no

all right but now suddenly you regain

your senses yeah no one's dead evil DF

you've got a death save coming yes

I swear to God ldiots worst rolls 20

dude it's happening you know it nope

it's a 201 faster I saw the two in my

mind and I thought there was a zero

all right good DF you are what is your

worst horrible fear oh man so truly

bizarre for death is that his worst fear

is not entirely a phantom it is there

before him and that is his mirrored self

down on the ground

he hates seeing that that what is what

everyone else sees him has and that's

what he could have been that he tries to

fight every day to not be in addition to

that nearby is tricks either Collard

shackled chained up made some kind of

slave and his near death and just a

miserable existence in such a way and

like when she turns like a deity just

glowing green eyes like the brightest

flame from that like every single one of

her fireballs

it's her in a in a thaumaturgic yell

that's and she's yelling you could have

you could have helped me you could have

been the one why aren't you here and

that causes DF to just run okay so since

you are just booking it and dashing you

get like 90 feet away yeah he goes real

far yeah you get to make a new saving

throw at the end of that all right turn

I'm so sad run home Oh

DC 17 yeah no snarling alright next up

is evil Strix you can make a new saving

throat and the whole person oh no the

whole person has ended right got it

yeah because omen broke his concentrate

I had thing I had to fix that's right so

you what do you want to do

strict's you're back in the game alright

evil strikes we'll look down at a I

think regular Strix didn't get that far

non evil strikes right yeah she got she

was able to basically - and move like

her move away hmm

yeah she's not terribly far she's about

30 feet away from home and okay evil

strikes is just gonna oh go ahead

um the chat reminded me that with oath

of conquest

I have aura of conquest so if a creature

is frightened of me its speed is reduced

to zero while in the aura and that the

creature takes psychic damage equal to

half the ring what's the range of the

aura ten feet only two yes one effective

and also they're reminding me that fear

is only a 30-foot cone and I was 40 feet

above but I was I was aware of that but

not as cooler this character actually

has a special fear spell that has a

reason 50 feet yeah it turns out because

she's so scary right so that's all salt

so evil strikes is going to use alter

self okay to give herself magical

weapons oh so she just grows like crazy

wicked claws me and just launches off

the bridge and misty steps onto the

ground and starts to chase Strix

screaming yesterday okay scariest

okay go ahead and make your claw Jack oh

yeah I imagine her just like launching

like that a bunny from Monty Python just

like you have plus one to hit on attacks

and damage rolls because these are

magical weapons and you can make a jack

roll okay so that was only a 10 so she

misses okay swing with your claws and

but she's still scary she's really scary

and strict evil Walton people palton

you are up there on the bridge with evil

evil in Evelyn a shark

Chris first quick question for good

paltin is

that fear something that I could have

reacted to if I have something that's

reactionary or does that not work when

we're in initiative like what do you

what are you thinking I wanted to see if

I could have counter spelled it for me

Oh

or is it are we too far into we're

probably too far into it at this point

too many things have happened as a

consequence of it

damn okay never mind then

good to know for people paltin what

would you like to do evil paltin oh man

so so peeps are running what what is

yeah what what has so what's good Strix

done at this point

good Strix is being chased by evil Strix

gotcha and there's stone construct

monkeys about to attack you

cool I'm going to yeah how close are

those guys to me one of them is within

striking distance of you okay I'm just

gonna have ten feet away I'm gonna just

thunder wave from myself and try and

like knock him off okay

[Music]

alright so I won't make the role for the

storm monkey you are successful in

hitting him he failed the seventh

overall the three cool so that would be

28 yeah okay that is nine nine points

yeah okay but you also succeed in

pushing at ten feet and now is it you

can push it ten feet off the bridge if

you want that's what I was gonna ask

alright so one of the monkeys gets

blasted backwards goes toppling off the

bridge flying back 10 feet and crashes

through what looks like a fountain down

below cool I mean not cool but good good

for evil palton always really happy and

then we are at normal Strix Strix you've

got a feral Strix chasing

I hate this I don't want this at all now

that but now that barrel strikes is down

here I can go into fireball the out

of her

which is what I'm going to do okay and

careful spell up all of my compatriots

of course alright so this is a fireball

for one yes

she's healing go make a saving throw for

evil Strix uh yeah she gets a six not

good okay she's still gonna take half

damage because she's a tea flame that's

right that's a 32 and also know they

never healed her so she had like three

hit points left oh okay

so she's just last you blast able Strix

into cinders vaporized yeah okay so evil

Strix shrieking and howling explodes in

a flurry of Ash and Ember and then

you've got to also keep running oh no

your spells broken nevermind right yeah

good palton ah so fear yeah fear so

you're gonna run as far as you can run

and then you get to make a saving throw

what is the thing that you're afraid of

okay I had to think about it so the fear

strikes in paltin sees his party and

they're all frozen and in front of them

is himself but with the ring of winter

still on no and everything's frozen

everything's covered in snow and

that and ice just run for it and

make your new saving throne DC seventeen

systems live wisdom good thing I'm

totally wise this is that totals 218

okay you break the spell whoa you're

about a hundred and twenty feet away

when you turn over resolve restored

yeah I wasn't drawn that's me so I

forgot I forgot something I forgot the

other monkey needs to attack yeah yeah

yeah yeah yeah I'm sending that after

after evil evylyn Emily make a d20 role

for me Holly

up top that's a three okay you're not

gonna hit evil evil in all right but

it's definitely in her way

Evelyn just swats a monkey paw away like

back to you almond okay let's see if

quick what is the range on stone shape I

I have a I'm hooked on it

like I I love stone shape it's gonna get

I think it's the greatest spell there is

so that's touch so so basically we sort

of have two fights going on here in some

ways right down here on the bottom so

who so the fight that is up top it has

evil evylyn of shark a big stone monkey

a stone monkey and then we have evil

palton down here with us I know you hope

Alton is still up on the bridge as well

evils trickle down here so the whole out

there yeah and then evil streaks is

posed in fact the only the only

dangerous threats are up on the bridge

right now because both evil palton are

sorry evil death and evil Strix are down

here on the ground incapacitated or dead

yeah yeah what I'm gonna do is from down

here we can sit on this suspension

bridge can we go evil in there or evil

evil yes have I met Evelyn I know I know

I'm gonna I'm gonna stone shape the

ground out from under her okay and since

it's a touch spell how are you gonna do

that with love let's see see so describe

what's happening underneath the bridge

here it's just about the thoroughfare in

some ways but it's also there's an

avenue that runs under the bridge that

you're standing on and then the bridge

crosses perpendicular to the Avenue

forty feet above is there any type of

sea getting either to touch it is gonna

be pretty tough I think minute I think

it's just actually that may not even be

possible

now that occurs to you you might be able

to do is there are like pillared struts

yeah I mean I had that fantasy to you'd

be surprised actually you won't be

surprised at all because you're Chris

Perkins

I'm not real real good at climbing yeah

that's I can handle so are there any are

there any dinosaurs here are there any

like moving through underneath this is

my animal handling is actually really

good for some reasons I wonder if I

could get a Flintstone style lift from

don't happen or not getting it from

urged I know I listen but I'm I'm coming

in I'm just trying to get in there yeah

if it may be possible for me to get up

on there because I just need I just need

to touch it Dino

I need to touch it I'm gonna touch it

with this that's comedic and wholesome

that doesn't you can definitely see it

there's like a an ankylosaurus hunt

about you know 20 feet away yeah yeah

yeah Ambler doing its best to keep it

out of out of dean there is a dangling

rope that often DF came in on that's

true there is that that is true I wonder

if I could use that rope Plus that strut

in a combo pack to get up under there so

I guess I can place that great Rothfuss

no not don't speak his name no no no as

with the rope and that maybe I can get

up there cuz I am I'm strong AF yeah

good yeah that's the combo I'm gonna try

to reuse that rope to bolster my

climbing scenario and get up there okay

make a strength athletics check here

comes sixteen that's good enough alright

yep yep you shimmy up that rope

yeah I mean my intention is to is to

basically make this whole underneath

underneath her and then basically just

have her fall through this structure

okay

Evelyn of Chartres just make a dexterity

saving throw against Oman's spell save

DC my spouse MVC my proficiency went up

so it's actually 17 very good that's the

magic number I rolled 16 oh okay

so you feel the ground the the bridge

underneath your feet soften turn to mud

and then you just sort of go right

through Wow

I think she lands very heavy too yep

you've crashed down onto the Avenue

below leaving only evil paulten on the

bridge with the giant stone monkey straw

don't let us down and omen you would you

be close enough to see Evelyn just fall

right passionately that all the sort of

mud and loose matter that you conjured

up absolutely yeah and actually evil and

you'll also take 46 damage which I'm

gonna have Jerry roll here comes 46 here

comes the first three that is six

oh ho 16 whoa okay three three four six

all right

evylyn evil in there Evelyn Evelyn very

important um well now that she's down

there she she looks pretty angry like

she kind of just like uh uh steps up

from under the rocks and lets them fall

off of her and she's covered in dust and

she's like she kind of like brushed

herself off but she she is going to run

over to awful DF and I would say lay on

hands she's actually gonna lay on face

just make the heck

out with it my god 420 hit points all

right

so babe I need your help all right and

yeah if you find yourself with 20 sudden

hit points great in a face full of face

and the other thing you notice DF is

that that magic sword gutter is lying

only a few inches from your hand oh I

know

wait gutter oh yeah cuz you dropped it

dropped it okay

is this is the Sun sword still on the

ground there Jim it is I suppose I don't

have enough movement to pick that up you

can do one free action thing pick up but

even though I lay down hands laying on

hands is a action for you I think it is

isn't it yeah so you've been interact

with an item basically for free on your

turn I'm gonna so make out make out make

out also grabbing the sword a bit all

right

Evelyn I'm sorry has the Sun sword D a

busy 20 hit points and it's evil d ass

turn seeing Evelyn right there and all

of her up begin glory she'll just say

something just snarky just kind like I

knew you cared and then roll away from

her as he's doing that he kicks up he

like rolls over got her and kicks up and

yeah eyes got got a reverse script in

his hand and then just a quick look

around and sees I think you actually

probably crystal around it dislikes a

lot of people ran away deaath is out of

way pop yeah there's yeah basic omens on

a Roman omen is on a rope Strix is ran

about 30 feet away okay stir yes ran on

the ground yeah about six miles away yes

Orion Walton

120 feet away great awful DF we'll take

out a throwing dagger and throw it at

omens rope rope attack oh that's that's

a 21 oh how come he awful Diaz can hit

with that man I wish I knew

all right so they wrote oh man you look

as this thing glides over your head is

like aa mist and when you look up with

the rope you see it just sort of calm

before your eyes and snap I'm going to

let you make a dexterity saving throw a

woman to try to grab on a monkey statue

that hasn't been animated there we go um

with advantage yeah absolutely

so dexterity saving throw I've got it

you ready yes whoa fifteen okay you

succeed there's actually 16 but I have

negative one Dex

all right so you just barely grab hold

of this monkey tail stone tail yeah I

was just sort of dangling from it after

the Rope is severed I love it and then

we jump - good deal

I'm still early a fear effect yes so I

have to run first unless you're out of

eyesight of me caress then you can make

another wisdom saving through against

actually yeah you'll probably would have

run out of eyesight at this point it's

probably ducked around a corner

somewhere ok so is this at the beginning

of my turn before movement and

everything so yeah you can make one now

before you do any actions great human

determination I'm gonna dig an advantage

on this great because more than ever he

needs to break free of it

Wow I rolled a 1 and a 19 whoa so 21

total yeah you drink yeah so after that

as deaath already in a cold sweat just

kind of stops himself in his track his

eyes darting around he realize like

where he ran to cuz it wasn't your fully

conscious it's just kind of

and then without a beat just Sprint's

white back towards where awful death is

our you know with a dash he can get up

into sixty feet see awful death and

throw a dagger at him okay and he's back

on hit man you guys come on Oh 24 oh he

actually had very good damage please uh

seven okay I mark down okay all right

but it sticks and evil the ass shoulder

off you're getting us packs all bloody

evil Strix is obliterated yeah mean evil

palton you are up there on the bridge by

yourself with the stone with the second

stone monkey that's about 15 feet away

from me fifteen feet huh yeah

how interesting because that is the

range of the attack I'm going to use

which is Thunder Wave okay

this monkey failed at saving throw say

alright I'm done with these things

mmm-hmm seven and does that also push

him off the bridge yes it does cool evil

Paul's just like no no no no no he

doesn't bambam oh my god

like I really don't want to deal with

this right now

good Strix all right this all of these

scenes have left her feeling very

strange she doesn't really understand

what's going on at all but she really

doesn't like evil evil and at all she's

just like Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn what is

happening why are they eating each

other's faces looks down and just throws

a fifth level fireball like on both of

them home invasion

I already rolled so it's 40 damage okay

so so just secretary saving travel

say Oh Dex Dex are you saving throw I

know the c14 no pal-14 you both take

forty fire damage alright

he only had 20 so I mean he oh yeah yeah

he's back down okay

yes I got a dagger in him you um because

she got lit on fire that kind of like

shoulder sash she was wearing it burned

away and you see that engraved above her

collarbone is the word Evelyn in cursive

it's weird

yeah branding by a very nice cleaned

refer all right but Evelyn is still

standing albeit scorched yep and that

brings us to good palton yeah haven't

called in Russian Chris actually will

quick so my understanding I don't know

if there's an ultimate rule or not but

when a character damaged in a single

turn that drops in below to a certain

threshold of negative hit points that

could possibly outright kill them right

yeah if it's your negative con if it's

gone in Evelyn's arms he just burns -

just gone Oh range is gone oh my god her

drops back down to the ground

alright she like Banshee wails yeah okay

it's becoming apparent

halten make another saving ironically

killed by Strix hey what's up this is a

wisdom saving throw versus the fear

effect to break it at the start of your

turn oh yeah I didn't did that nevermind

that broke you're fine okay so how far

am i from

Evelyn 60 feet 60 feet uh how she how's

she lookin she lookin kind of beat up or

pretty charred yeah okay I wouldn't be

able to like physically reach her and do

something in my turn now no okay then

I'm going to let me see if this works

available there I'm going to cast

dissonant whispers at

fifth level okay so that is a wisdom

saving throw go ahead Evelyn Oh me yeah

seventeen that's gonna do it ah you fool

you take half damage you take half

damage

yeah so it's let me see three four five

so it's 76 okay cool wait oh no

so uh let me see here so that gets

killed by straight and Evelyn gets

killed by paulten this is gonna be dope

[Music]

is that in the cards nineteen how maybe

sixty I say seven seven seven okay

mm-hmm twenty four half of which is 12

mm-hmm and he casts and he's just like

that way is Paulding aware what she did

with the fear oh yeah you okay yeah you

know who does it before casting he just

looks at her it's just like die

you see the mean things like she goes

all robotic and starts twitching and

stuff and her gold eyes just kind of

rolled back in her head and start

spinning and then she just overloads and

collapses alright so the there are two

things we need to wrap we need to wrap

up very quickly because we're late but

Evelyn tonight wouldn't I say something

really quick that twelve is exactly how

many hit points she hello and nice oh my

god

that's awesome so Evelyn is down evil

Strix is powder so is evil D AB okay can

I say something free football team yes

if it can be he sees his whole

volunteers just like

nope he's turns around like nope nope

nope Alton disappears well before he

just liked it

hey disclosure I didn't actually do

anything who's gonna go alright the last

action or activity of this episode goes

to our special guest star Jerry woo

so omen you're hanging from the

underside of the bridge you can see

Evelyn has fallen

two of her compatriots have been reduced

to ash by fireballs and you hear no more

up on a bridge what do you want to do

let's see gosh so because I'm hanging

underneath there I don't actually know

like how the monkey is dealing with this

well you saw the two monkeys get blasted

off the bridge oh that's all right

that's right he fell down that's taken

care of well it depends on how much we

think evil palton is a threat if he

wants to go home if he wants to get

shwarma or whatever right do we care

about that I don't know I don't know I

don't I can I have a hard time telling

which one is the good one which ones

that's where I just got here I like that

you're just having this dialogue I'm

trying to make that I'm trying to make

the I'm trying to make the the situation

so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stone

shape the bottom of this bridge into a

way for me to get down okay you can

essentially kind of transform the statue

that you're in contact waiting into a

turn here Paul yeah exactly a fun fire

pole coming down this stone fire pole

back down to the ground yeah exactly

down and say well Strix look this has

been way way harder than I expected

please my friends please well it was

free before we don't have any money you

can always call me

oh there's yeah but what if I need more

you would have funded more than you

next time you can own my bear no have I

have I caught up to this at this point

yes yes we'll say that everybody all the

regular waffle crew is sort of regrouped

I'm gonna ask Ullman like what do you

want well I have a lot of work and I

don't want to do all of it I guess is

the most clear way of saying it well you

could always call me and then there's

three other people here you can call

will help you all you have to do is ask

I said it before and she's like hmm like

is there something I could give you for

this oh yeah I mean he likes money

mm-hmm here's your's here listen let me

let's we'll work this out once you

really really owe me where are we gonna

put this I turn to the captain of the

guard and I say hey I'll come back very

briefly and I will fix the issues that

are with this I need to take a nap and

have a sandwich and then I'll come back

and fix this bridge I apologize but you

took us under false pretenses and nearly

got us murdered I'm wondering if you

have a place for myself and the people

you falsely imprisoned briefly to rest

and recuperate he nods and says he does

yes all right that that that will be a

perfectly say a guard quarter will be a

perfectly safe place for us to do this

ritual okay

then he will take you he will escort you

away and see that you guys are not

troubled by anyone going forward yeah

anybody balton just a quick coda to you

Paul Abel Calton make a stealth check no

no 15 okay we're good you managed to

evade and escape the guards who are sort

of coming up on both sides of the bridge

just like it's like straight through the

thing where it's like they're coming in

on both sides and then these just slips
