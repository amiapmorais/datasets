hi everybody and welcome to dye scammer

actually we have got a full house today

with a regular cast of course and three

beloved guest stars are members of the

Chickenfoot coven and we will introduce

them to you again momentarily but before

we do that let me do a brief recap of

what has happened that has any bearing

whatsoever on tonight's adventure

previously in dice camera action

d/f got his hands on an iron flask and

released the fire primordial mogera the

dawn Titan from inside of it I thought

this episode was about making pies can't

make pies without fire and so he did

this in the bowels of a fire giant

stronghold and in the process of doing

so incinerated accidentally a bunch of

dwarven slaves whom the fire science had

kept prisoner months later back in

Waterdeep deaath was visited by members

of dwarven clans not wanting vengeance

for his actions but recompense

compensation in the form of hell of a

lot of gold pieces rumored to be hidden

somewhere in water deep by its previous

open lord d'Agoult never ember coins

that had been minted in dwarven

foundries and embezzled by Lord never

ember and then the dwarves left deaath

alone to carry off on this task but

various interesting things have happened

since and not a lot of progress has been

made in tracking down the gold however

last week the crew was invited to the

castle enter a state a wealthy noble

estate owned

and lived in by Victoria and Amalia

castle enter local Lords who run a money

lending operation as well as other

businesses in the city very very rich

and apparently have ties to Asmodeus the

lord of the nine hells oh you know as

one does yes exactly

and so they told me they told you a sad

story in which their family was on a

hard times in order to extricate

themselves from the situation made a

deal with Asmodeus the terms of which

included the souls of their three

children one of which has already been

claimed two of which are in danger of

being claimed if the waffle crew doesn't

help them find enough gold to buy

themselves out of their predicament for

which the castle enters will well

they're open to help the waffle crew any

way they need in exchange for the waffle

crews help securing this gold while

these negotiations were going on Simon

wandered off into the castle enter a

state when palton finally tracked him

down it was only in a hidden temple of

Asmodeus too deep below the residence

where Simon was being indoctrinated into

a devil worshipping cult you know as

children do yes paltin was able to use a

mass suggestion spell to help liberate

Simon from the clutches of these devil

worshippers

before while the rest of the waffle crew

was meeting a chain devil that used to

be the castle enters eldest son paltin

what what do you do once you have Simon

back well let's see where we're still in

the inn that the legend of this hidden

temple yes okay and you had you had some

cultists on this devil that had

interposed itself between you and your

escape right the the man deucey yes

so as they're attacking mm-hmm

and they're still like the the tiefling

yes she was the one who was not she was

the only one who saved against your

spell right so I like turning her I'm

just like so is that a problem is that a

bad should they not they not have done

that you can see that she's just

screaming at them all to stop okay

I think I can piece together the answer

out of that um great so I'm going to run

okay Simon goes with you tell us if he

doesn't like this place yeah me neither

and so you run yep we leave yep and at

some point during the negotiations with

the castle enters DF Evelyn and Strix

you all see palton has just kind of

returned and he's got simon by the hand

and hey Simon just waves did you have

fun playing Simon yes he did he had tons

of fun did you play with all the other

kids I couldn't find him but he found

the library yeah books yeah reading is

fun what you read again you can but

Simon might not I only roll at ten okay

okay

I just I'm just gonna say that I know

they're lying but I don't care so how's

the house the House negotiations are we

good are we done here I think

everything's gone worse but I'm not sure

I don't think we have a very clear idea

of what it is that we get out of this

but that's fine we can just help yeah

and something that we can decide amongst

yourselves incoming mm-hmm and the

castle enters have said that they're

comfortable with that yeah great so

great well we'll have a lot of

discussions you do

back home yeah where we should go right

now to discuss for sure yeah yeah

definitely

dude you you're always on top of it

you're alright let's go let's go yeah

yes I believe our work is done here

mm-hmm oh god I forgot you were here

says the man says the gift Commodore

who's been standing around mmm trying to

show it's like yeah we're good all

wrapped up and we can send people for

the paperwork get old it'll be fine it's

good we go real hurry I mean don't you

wanna stay like oh just like time is

just such a precious commodity and God

knows how much we Vander does know yeah

yeah all that's actually right we have

very little time to figure a lot of

things out mm-hmm and there is

definitely nothing I'm avoiding that

will not come back to bite me in the ass

in like a entire season so we're good

let's go sorry Anders for their kind

hospitality and we'll get back to them

soon I'm still fine no did we got the

auction coming up and we're supposed to

help them secure the stone with the lure

in the meantime we can think about

things that we want them to do for us

can we buy other stuff at the auction

that seems like more stuff to discuss

when we leave now okay you know maybe

let's go yeah I mean like like I'm just

gonna say goodbye but I'm also gonna

make suspicious eyes at them at the

castle Anders yeah okay they will make

sure that their teeth league manservant

sees you toward the exit with all due

haste by the most direct route mm-hmm

mail it van der bless and shine upon you

and your house they thank you for the

blessing and as you leave you can see

that the castle enter it takes only a

minute for the castle enter coach to

circle around outside the front gates to

bury you safely back to troll skull

alley should you wish

travel by that route there's a castle as

a driver and castle enter livery waiting

yeah they had the someone from the city

watch escort us there Wiki also be

escorting us back no that's fine okay if

there will be a city watch escort that

was true

captain Woodrum precisely okay so when

you are taken back to trill skull alley

the coachman doesn't wait long as soon

as you basically disembark and

Warrington hops off the back it takes

off returning whence it came

you see sitting outside on the stoop of

the Waffle House three familiar faces a

laksa Don a shadow Kai and a cobalt now

remind us about your characters Brian

Cameron kicka just give us sort of a

one-line summary or two line summary of

who your characters are we'll start with

the lack of a hug them sorry

yeah critters a easy kobold real ratty

covered in a like patchwork leather

cloak looks and price smells pretty

gross he's a kobold with a heart of gold

and a patchwork cloak cameron pretty

much the exact opposite large hulking

figure like clean and pristine and very

kind of docile and like still stunning

white clothing great okay so we've got a

eight we've got a pristine docile locks

it on with a heart of gold and Deardon

Danna is a dumpster gremlin well she's a

shattered Kai who has like just

everything about her is completely white

and like pretty clean but I've it's

pretty obvious that her clothing is old

and worn almost ghost that yeah she she

basically just looks like the ghost

shouter chi nice alright and a shadow

kai with a heart of gold now the three

yeah I think of this but you guys showed

up for your regular shift and two and

you probably have some ingredients and

other things that you customarily bring

with you to keep the kitchen stocked but

you came to find the waffle crew

basically locked up tight which is

unusual usually there's somebody home or

they just don't bother locking the doors

it's all locked up and and so the three

of you have been waiting to see if

anybody shows up and haven't been

waiting long

maybe like 15 minutes 20 minutes when

you saw this coach this is this wealthy

rich looking gold bedecked coach pull up

and the waffle crew just sort of pour

out of it and this is also the first

time that you've seen Simon in his new

form so you're a little surprised by

this young boy who has the features of

the wooden puppet you saw before but now

appears to be fully human

now in strict seasons I'm she's gonna be

like oh I'm so glad that you're enjoying

some fresh air between working that's

really important it's awful it's really

important it's way too bright out here

also what are you doing out here the

door's locked

did we lock the door no ah stretch like

immediately looks at Diaa felt like

locks door problem she's like what wait

didn't we lock the door I feel like we

locked the door we dropped the door and

we locked the door hey hey um hey excuse

me

yes palton ah thank you

who the hell are these they've been here

for months

and point it paltin and say is that the

one that you're in love with but I'm

gonna just look up at this guy and say

yes we have a kitchen they clearly know

your darkest secrets

well I mean it's it's broadcast like

1500 people a week so that's not

surprising but like who like why don't I

all right hey do you honestly I make all

the pies by myself there's like yeah you

know magic oh I mean that's that's

probably the nicest thing you ever have

said to me so I'm just going to sit here

silently for a moment and and we welcome

leap a little and she weeps a little

stop god no stop it I'm still weeping

stop you're and I is going to try to get

your ups tricks by giving her a skull oh

that's fun she immediately stopped

weeping I hope no one gives me skulls

around here I love this is great scholar

is it like a bugbear skull oh wow that's

got a big that's good size yeah you just

had that like hidden away and a pouch

yeah two bags of skulls I mean this is

great though like she'll find like a

dead potted plant which is most likely

outside of the house and just kind of

like sit it there ornamentally and be

like I like it thank you

the door is still locked yeah yeah I'll

lock it

Thank You squigglies dad he may've been

here for months the dork he does not

seem to work oh no did we have to pay

rent well we get locked out by the

council the governor I just would like

to unlock it not using the door key okay

rogue fancy you go ahead and make your

dexterity check it just be uh Dias

mindset just kind of being something

like there must be something wrong with

all yes Jess it feels so good

dr. 20 yes oh man he's just like a cop

yeah it's pretty much what is that with

all your bonuses 39 no my guys that's

all right yes like like just make a new

lock then in there he just kind of like

blue in it all the tumblers opened yeah

so you you just very very quickly

effortlessly like is the key unlocks

like Paul Tain's like standing there

with a rock next to a window and like oh

one thing you did notice Paul tan is

you're standing there ready to break the

window is that all of the curtains are

drawn do I find it it's suspicious

never drawn the curtains usually you

don't care about drawing curtains before

you leave mm-hmm that's weird all right

so yes DFU you can push open the door

and you can see well you don't have dark

vision and there's no real light

entering the tap room with all of the

windows covered so it's pitch-black

inside oh can I peer around like I which

I probably would be doing anyway to look

inside like me can I appear too because

I'm very nosy yeah you can do the Scooby

Doo thing like don't you everybody with

dark vision peers in because I see it's

dark I'm just like I can't see anything

I just cast dancing lights okay so as

you're looking in the dark vision and

then suddenly there are all these torch

flames bobbing around in the room you

can see that there appears to be a lone

occupant he is sitting in the corner in

Strad Vaughn chair ovitch not good I'm

not know his his legs crossed it's a

it's a sort of a thin figure and based

on the color of his skin you'd think he

was at drought no don't worry I took

conversational Joe in high school which

you can't quite see his face because

it's sort of covered by the large wide

brim of a hat no feather strikes one of

your your pie makers is sitting in my

chair that's it

where am I supposed to sit okay it's

tricks looks in and says are you here to

become part of a coven Holly didn't want

Strix to do that

hill-hill drum his fingers on the

armrests of stron Vaughn chair of itch

and say I am heal with an affair of a

partnership one that is mutually

beneficial for all concerned

Vienna commands strive and cherish this

kind of tip okay yes when you and you

cast the spell and cherubic animates and

kind of heaves him out he just sort of

hops to his feet and looks back at the

chair was when I consider his posture

threatening he does not have any weapons

drawn although there is a rapier okay

she's to his belt Oh a partnership like

some sort of sponsorship or like a

collab like DF handles the money but I

can help with the creative we could

produce something real nice or do you

own a local business that you want to Co

you know promote with us okay what evil

in evil in you know before you start

saying those things why don't you check

to see if they're super evil oh okay

well nice to meet you I'm evil in my

vein in the service of Lysander do you

know he'll come he'll make his way just

very non-threatening ly over to you and

say do come in please Street when he's

close enough I imagine he's in range of

my eldritch sight so I want to know how

many magic things he has on him all of

them yes box it on this should also be a

voice that deaath immediately recognizes

yes you recognize this voice is speaking

to you while you were in Carson

rated in castle water deeps dungeon yeah

I couldn't see them T for a visitor yes

please merlock

please they host now they've done it the

whole time where have I been

it's dark in here I just started opening

curtains he's got at least eight magic

items on him bricks is like stopping

Paulding like no don't open that he

wants the curtains closed don't open the

curtains I'm going to use awakened mind

to tell everybody else about like the

magic items on him and what's magic and

evylyn also used to find sense on Strix

a suggestion to find out how evil he is

not at all he is a lovely guest and I

don't know why anyone would suspect that

he was evil

who the hell is talking to me don't do

that

Strix is like look they have magic

you're not my boss it's true are you

sure yeah my name is on the least it way

is my name on delete I don't think

you've ever bothered to check I think

there's a lot of logistics we need to

talk about it's gonna pour Paulton a

glass of wine to get him to stop asking

questions

you can't just expect

let's put stop and every stop Yellin

rich doesn't know what to do with this

so she's just going to say you know what

alright coven let's let's get the

kitchen we'll make some pies we'll make

our guests feel at home

what sort of pie would you like we

didn't get your name what's your name

helmet me to introduce myself I am Shila

XL a band way I've had the pretty name

oh and I he says not as pretty as yours

my lady how do you he leans in and

kisses your hand oh oh I see we're we're

by les Todd number two just like it just

it just feels like a fallback trade at

this now like it's so like every

I'm now I'm just I'm not I just

I'm anyway carry on are you jealous I

mean I could flirt with you if you want

I am NOT here to partake of your pious

although I believe they are quite good I

am here on a very important matter and

that is I want to work with you to

create the perfect pie already well

there is there is a food critic arguably

the finest food critic in all of heaven

who is arrived in Waterdeep and I have

invited him to come by here and hi this

pie that we are going create everyone

coming here together they have been what

I don't pay attention this is a shop sir

wait wait wait

which food critic his name is Iran's

inshallah

oh my gosh Ranson show bald the one who

has like a million in subscribe

followers exactly the same I know I'm

done goodbye everyone

Unni so I have taken the liberty to

bring with me the recipe that we will be

making any hands Strix a black squirrel

tube okay with bone Stoppers at each end

I like that

that's neat looking all dramatically

there's no why we can't make nothing you

have on display is going to measure up

two runs and standards of course he's

looking for something truly exceptional

made with only is the finest ingredients

should be fine you know we have our own

fresh eggs and and we don't we we have

enough smell look at it I'm saying this

as I'm looking at it now you say you see

a recipe for Luskin fractal helix apple

pie okay all of us just blink for a

while he says most of the ingredients

are readily available in your market I

am sure but there are two that are

particularly important

that we will not be able to get through

customary channels alright I'm ready are

you like this critics manager or what's

you know why are you no no not at all

I have endeavored in the past to impress

this critic with some of my own gourmet

cooking and cuisine and in fact last

year when he was in my neck of the woods

I made a pie for him which he found

somewhat lacking and it was mostly under

dark ingredients which did not sit well

with him apparently so we're going to

try something more to his tastes this

time you see the only thing you need to

know about me is that I like to win oh

you have like a thing for him

not at all oh I just like to win oh well

if we make it how is that you winning

well you see he has come here to try a

number of pies made by all of the finest

chefs in the city and all of the finest

Bacon's and it is now incumbent upon us

to put them all to shame oh so it's like

a team-up it's like a like a crossover

my recipe and my gourmet sensibilities

coupled with the the the baking acumen

of this fine establishment how can we

use well we can lose actually and that's

something else I need to discuss with

you our greatest competition is going to

be a dragon born butcher baker named

fracas we will have to make sure that

his pie does not impress see also a

candlestick maker that I do not know and

when you say make sure his pie does not

impress we poison it I'm did not a lot

just a little bit we do whatever is

necessary to ensure that our pie wins

and his pie loses no just a little

poison I have we've talked about no

poison

fine okay let's relax blubbering back

out with tea service for nine at this

point perfect pearl acts like Strix is

not just all praise Li you really do

make the best team any placement is like

oh the kids we forgot about the kids

again I'll look at them mr. mystery man

well it would be great to work with you

I was under oppression that everybody

who works at this establishment needs to

be buried alive first now he's a

contractor well says Simon I think I'm

gonna go upstairs and contemplate the

merits of satanic cults in Dungeons and

Dragons bye speaking of which who is

that kid yeah this seems like a y'all

thing so I'll leave y'all to it and that

we don't know what wait we don't know

what we don't know what the ingredients

are yet we might need your help

halten please cool ping me if you do I

think my son might be considering a cult

life so I'm gonna go up there and die

just follow up ie alright the only

ingredients that we will need to really

make sure we get even though it is an

apple pie a lot of the flavor will be

brought out by the addition of some very

rare very exquisite character pears

[Music]

characters is that one of the hell's no

all right but this follow Saxony

response I couldn't tell there was only

one place in the city that grows them

mm-hmm a local wizard he has a carrot or

a pear tree or so I've been told

uh-huh his name is Quan Diwali oh really

quick like as palton was like going up

he like walks by evylyn and just like

leans in goes our sons first fourth wall

break

[Laughter]

is this wizard most likely not going to

part with these pairs I believe that he

is very very proud of his pals and if he

is not willing to give them up we may

have to take them by force all right I'm

thinking I'll probably have to make the

pie so that we can make sure that it's

the best but I'm looking at the the

coven like like sizing everyone up and I

look back it

see isn't even like who do you think

would be the best to send to get the

pears we only we could get by with only

say three of them three pears I'm

guessing that you're either going to

have to convince him put him to sleep or

take them I'm sure he would just give

him if we asked real nice I agree you

can buy them now we're trade Joel Axl

Trix deaaath aside and says you are no

doubt wondering after our last

conversation how we've ended up in this

strange predicament correct I I must

admit I was not prepared to see you

again so soon but the discovery that

runs in Shaba was going to be in warth

or deeper I'm in water deep now it's

just too great an opportunity to pass by

a chance to redeem myself for my last

failure as well and forth at the end I'm

willing to bury the hatchet and put

aside any past differences we may have

developed over the little short time

we've known each other and we worked

what a common end become friends even

partners in all affairs

I will even split the gold with you I'll

tell you what if we can win grants and

shop all over and make the best pie he

has ever tasted I will donate my share

of the gold to the children of water

demon

I have left you speechless second out

some things are more important some

things are more important than gold you

know winning for instance yeah yeah I

mean any past grievances to be had can

be simply lost over I mean you already

imparted a lot of great information upon

me so I see no reason that I should bear

any grudge against you that I

enlightened and in the spirit of

competition you're right

winning is great and nothing would make

these fine folks better than showing off

and that the fact that they are the

finest pie makers around he sorted he

sort of lifts up his eyepatch looks at

them closes back down and says no doubt

oh but there is one other ingredient

that will be particularly hard to find

and it is the it's the third one on the

list they're in place of the cinnamon we

need some white like in which you can

only get around here at the bottom of

the harbor to that end I have approached

another wizard in wattle deep her name

is Gwen de Gaulle off she has a device

that you can use to go down under the

water and scrape some of the lichen off

an old wreck and bring it back to the

surface where we can cook it dry it out

and use it as a cinnamon substitute all

tonight stabbing white white likens that

like a fungus or an algae awaken it is a

like him it is it grows on things on the

other water oh yeah I don't know liken

it is I've been to the water a lot I

fished you fished now this this at this

Apple

that she has her going under the water

can hold at least two people I believe

it is quite cramped but it should serve

our meats huh

fascinating okay got it

everything else we can get from your car

belts or from the market oh great this

should be easy then we have plenty of

staff will you be sticking around to

partake in the creation process

oh no I will be with the recipe in hand

I am Schell Strix can more than manage

and once you dispense with all of the

tasks that need to be done I'm going to

be spending my time taking the fair lady

evil in for a walk and sure come on

don't come over to you and he says this

is a this is a wondrous time of year to

go walking in this earth the city of the

Dead and there I will show you have you

ever seen the brilliant hilly Adonis

know there are flowers that glimmer with

the light of the Sun I love flowers and

the Sun well Strix do you need my help

okay I can stop this either if this

happens at least twice a week

what does nothing just go okay well like

just instantly it's just like side even

writing down just like flipping over

stumble it dries ha should take poem

with you I'm sure he'd like us pop did

we don't honestly need your help anymore

please just go with them

oh I've been waiting forever to hear you

say that alrighty

oh wait let me go back up and check on

Simon really quick because I'm sure

there was dialogue to be exchanged right

so actually probably before you bailed

on him there was just enough time for

him to tell you that the you know that

little kobold preacher down there

downstairs

dad yeah yeah so remember remember we

were supposed to put them through tests

and you just said do whatever you want

yeah oh that was them they took the test

yeah so III well I I took him out to the

mud flats to try to get some of the wine

and he didn't make it and so I left him

in the mud but he was but he was

downstairs

yeah I guess he survived you know I find

it not likely that he would be able to

survive knowing the UM you can imagine

him being able to extricate himself from

the mud and crawl back to the city

okay well you're not surprised that

Simon left him there it's like well

you're learning well so and then your

alarm goes off tumble tumble tumble

tumble tumble mm-hmm and they and here

we are a walk huh walk sounds great out

in the sunlight is it day or night day

out in the sunlight i telepathically say

to paulten when drow have sunlight

sensitivity he'll be it it will be

harder for him to defend himself and

then I want to slip him a dagger thanks

wink

I just like I'm I'm too focused on this

pie I'm just like all right dangerous to

go underwater

I'm and paltin evil and just go with go

with Daryl axel just both of you go just

yeah you Lenny if you go with them you

enjoyed the walk maybe you get it time

to ask him a few questions perhaps about

no flowers what Andrew Morin and Andrew

Morin brothers Astro Astro axel about

that

should be good it is there any any

particular information I should know or

asked him up father son bright that's

fine to you guy knows a lot knows a lot

how do you know that yeah how do you

know that yeah oh so you you get do you

get cozy like secret coffee or you go to

the pub uh no those are be pleasant

things that's right we don't do things

like that yeah I forgot okay I'll be

sure to tell you about it sometime oh

yeah nice wonderful walk sounds good

yeah react to the fact that I'm just

assuming that Paulson can come with us

he doesn't seem to care and but he says

Oh before we leave the Ronson is going

to be coming by tomorrow so you have

plenty of time to bake the pie once you

get the ingredients of course that

should be a part way and the other

priority should be making sure that

fracas and his dreadful meat pie does

not win Branson over right you'll find

trakis he is dragon bomb who lives in

the field ward he has a butcher shop

there alright alright I sort of look

around my kind of bow all right dear now

you have to take care of the Dragonborn

you do not kill him

oh you do not you do not you just make

him very sleepy i sleepy Barry sleep not

like still breathing she just starts

furiously rummaging through her

herbalism kit mm-hm

just very sleepy what if I just maybe I

can steal all those pies that's that's

too obvious just go in and all like

it'll be like buy a pie and then somehow

make him sleepy I don't I don't care how

you do it Jarl axel says fracas is known

for having some sort of secret

ingredient in is meat pies if you can

find out out I will pay

follow that secret just see yeah we'll

be done

I trust you I trust you a task I don't

know why I trust anyone to be a hundred

percent honest with you it usually

doesn't work out for me stop that it's

not safe

yeah you're right well what's water

boundaries anyway uh let's see she looks

over at her lock she's like do you would

you rather I go with you underwater so

in case something bad happens I can

teleport us out and then you can survive

you gotta be here to actually make the

pie

yeah I'm pretty familiar with the harbor

district so would be difficult for me to

get there all right and well I think if

you can fit I think that you should go

with critter I think so too because

they're two of us or one per lock right

yes per block should not go underwater

yeah most things no so critter you're

gonna go with DF and keep us safe

underwater and Hurlock you're going to

go and make friends with the pale wizard

and I will I suppose stay here unless if

you dude if you need help and though I

have to make the pie you all have to go

get the ingredients I have to make the

perfect crust it has to be perfect

Warrington will say I can go with him

Maya go shishun skills up tip-top you

know I think both of you would make an

extremely obvious team

I once negotiated a treaty with the

Artic their plant people know we use the

guns later after the negotiation

collapsed so then you did negotiate a

treaty no the treaty was in place it

just in last very long Oh whatever

Warrington you go with per lock just be

tall and pick pears I don't know

yes I believe our hide will avail us

greatly in this endeavor

what excellent excellent maybe bring

some something some leverage for this

wizard something that you know both of

you you're both from not from around

here so maybe knowledge bring him to

bring him some knowledge of your your

home worlds where planes are I don't

even know where you're from and I

haven't even bothered to figure that out

I have a cursed sword am I like no

you're gonna need that if he is a wizard

perhaps he is interested in magic yes

exactly I have a damp tube sock if

everybody wants borrow that you're going

in the water

tube sock is coming with you it's gonna

get more dead real wet tube sock yeah

okay got you yeah just you give that to

D if if you look sad don't that's a good

idea

I'm great in fact anytime at D it looks

sad you just give him something yes

that's usually what I do to sad people

yeah me too

see that's why you work here everybody

happy yeah oh you gave it to him I feel

like DF looks sad right now hold on I

got something for you buddy wait I got

you bud I reach in and I take out the

dagger I was just given I'm like I got

this for you but may it serve you well

it is a nice dagger yes take the dagger

and more just be like you should like

come on dude they gave me a gun earlier

daggers not gonna all right we have our

plans are we ready we're gonna make the

best pie that water deep and Jarl axel

maybe I don't know has ever seen also

and she like kind of walks over it to DF

and there's like make sure that the

lichen isn't a poison yeah okay all

right really break and people leave so

Jarl axel before he steps outside he

sort of just sort of rubs the the tip of

the brim of his hat and transforms

before your eyes

into a human who is sort of got a nice

tan beautiful Jade eyes dark hair down

to his shoulders swept back away from

his face and then he pulls out of his

vest a pair of John Lennon sunglasses

and puts and puts them on the bridge of

his nose

and just sort of pushes them up to the

top of his nose you can see he actually

looks a lot like paltin only a couple

inches taller

[Laughter]

is this your true form or can you look

like however you want no milady I

presented you with my to form earlier

but I find that some of the people in

the city although they are very tolerant

tend to be somewhat off put by the

presence of a drow mmm

that's too bad it is tonight a shame

very much a shame also he's like I'm not

sure how well that's gonna fly mostly

its trademark so you might want to get

an original idea I am quite comfortable

in my current form thank you I am NOT

and you do whatever you need to feel

comfortable even like puts her arm

through the crook of his around like his

arm reassuring you walk outside into the

Sun you know straight wall street's is

like get out I'd apply to make lame she

started to whack people with a broom

yeah exactly she's a gap yeah so you all

kind of spill out her lock Warrington DF

palton Jarl Axl evylyn critter dear 'no

you're all now standing out in the

street getting your bearings yeah and

and stricter like like open the door to

and look at critter and you she's like

keep him safe and then hits him with the

broom

little bit take those back inside oh all

right Lee's dad can I bag her sorry

what's that do you're nice those 2d a

squigglies dad can I borrow a dagger oh

you were talking to me yeah I didn't

hear my name you'll give up dearness

dagger back okay uh uh or anyone with it

all right so in order to make one in

order to get to the wizard kwan volio

who has a tower in the no sorry the

southern ward her lock and wardington

will have to basically walk south

through this this ward that they're

currently in basically through

residential streets and then hugged the

wall of the city of the Dead so actually

they can kind of follow Jarl axel evylyn

and palton for a short bit of their

journey to the southern ward before they

have to split off DF and critter you

want to head to the doc ward you can

also follow them for a little bit but

eventually you're gonna want to veer off

to one of the main roads and then head

south to the doc Ward on your own path

dear Anna your path takes you in a

completely opposite direction from

everybody else you'll be heading north

out of this district into the grubby

rat infested low level field ward kind

of like water deep cesspool and therein

hopefully find practices butcher shop so

you're the first one to part company

with everyone else okay are you all

trying to get to your destinations on

foot water deep is not so big that you

can't get to where you want to go within

an hour or two on foot and it's a nice

day yeah her Luck's got a pretty long

stride and he's walked with somebody a

vehicle build so yes yeah I'm taking I

don't know walk the streets of Waterdeep

but I feel like if there is a chaperone

there right

unfortunately critter is he can sort of

bundle himself up a little bit too yeah

concealed feature so he almost looks

like just a kind of like a weird leprous

halfling strix is also at some point put

a witch hat on him oh well there you go

yeah like the market yeah I saw it

I feel like critically keep up with me

would take factory roads

yep all right so you travel south down

the high road together lots of people

passing by the people who get the most

attention right now of course are per

lock and Warrington and but as as Doris

was pointing out and say as you've

discovered yourself water davian's are

fairly nonplussed

but Warrington does a Spurlock so do do

eat through that trunk of yours Oh what

is that an affectation or is it part of

some sort of you know method of

consuming food your drink for your trunk

absolutely not no it's it's basically a

nose that would be like asking any other

person here if they drank through their

nose no it's just it's prehensile I can

I can use it like a hand almost and I

like you know take out a chef's knife

and wreath she's it with the trunk haha

that's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous

well ha you are rather comical creature

yes why relish our walk together this

would be quite something between the two

of us yes well

I have never met your kind and I've been

just several worlds is that so I have

only been to this one and isn't her so

your world is your world is called what

I'll travel did you yeah world is once

again oh and I make a noise that's its

basic like an elephant noise like I

don't know the I'm in this world yes yes

that's rather hard to spell

I bet y'all the best the same eventually

you and he break off actually you

probably didn't even notice you've just

started walking off on your own and lost

the rest of the gang as you make your

way down south past the city of the Dead

into the trades ward which is very very

busy bustling place with all sorts of a

panoply of races coexisting peacefully

together and all kinds of trade activity

going on and you can see Warrington says

keep their eye out there anything that

might be suitable as a projectile you

you would like me to throw something no

I'm listening the market to buy

something specifically I'm looking for

sling stones or other metal balls before

Dena will keep an eye out for sure I'll

be scanning the marketplace while we're

on her walk death when you branch off

with critter into the doc ward it

becomes this tangle of streets sloping

down toward the harbor and you're

heading to the western edge of the doc

word almost the western edge of the city

right in the shadow of mount water deep

there is a section of the doc ward that

is rundown and in some places burnt down

and has been slowly been kind of rebuilt

up into this shanty town and there are

also these sort of ships that have kind

of been torn apart and rebuilt into

homes all on this clattering mildew

encrusted series of docks collectively

known as mist shore

called that because the mist tends to

sort of the fog tends to gather here and

stay here throughout the day so even now

the Sun is this sort of pale or but this

blurry orb lost in the fog that seems to

be hovering around this ramshackle

decaying half-burnt section of the city

also along the way Diaz has a

conversation with critter yep gotta say

could our help familiar are you with

lichen I think it's some sort of like

moss right right yeah yeah there's a

whole bunch of moss agressiveness see

where I live in the sewers Oh oh good

how familiar familiar are you with

telling if something is poisonous or not

I mean I've eaten a lot of things and

sometimes they make me kind of kind of

puke but that's about the extent of my

knowledge knobbly is that helpful just

Thank You critter you're welcome dear

'no you are going to be the first to

reach your destination as you're not

crossing the entire city to get to where

you need to go the field ward is

literally only about five or six blocks

away from troll skull alley but as i

said as soon as you leave the gates of

the North Ward and descend down into the

field ward it's like a completely

different city you don't know much about

this place but it looks like it was

built very quickly and very badly a maze

of tangled streets and run-down places

there's also smoke that hangs in the air

down here sort of trapped between the

walls of the field ward and there's a

lot of poverty children who are

basically living neglected lives down

here rats crawling around in dark

corners and unsavory types who even you

would not probably deigned to engage in

a conversation with but you do find

practices butcher shop on on salt pork

Street

and you can see that the it used to be

some sort of old ancient windmill big

stone windmill that has had its veins

kind of stripped and it's kind of

crumbling and dilapidated it's got a

building attached to the cylindrical

part of the windmill where the the

butcher shop actually appears to be

contained and there's a sign above the

butcher shop door that is actually a

haunch of rotting meat hanging from

hooks with a metal axe hovering above it

and there are flies swarming around the

haunch of meat of this sign and

basically itched into the axe is the

name fracas well dear Nate's feeling a

little left out being as she's the only

one that was sent off alone it's almost

like no one wants to spend time with her

so she's gonna find a rat to talk to all

right that is not the case dear so you

you sort of wander astray looking for a

rat who will actually engage you in

conversation make a perception check to

see what you find if anything she's the

most trusted yeah she's probably gonna

like have a bit of cheese out to try to

lure one to our section okay you can see

a rat sort of perks up it takes an

interest in you and then sort of darts

down a little bit of an alley which is

strewn with garbage and other refuse and

you kind of you kind of follow it a

little bit to see if you can actually

engage it s'prise then you are very

surprised to find that the rat sort of

disappear is under some garbage but you

can see the red glowing eyes of what

appeared to be three giant rats in this

alley who sort of come out and look at

you with their red eyes

I'm just gonna squat down a bit and say

hello I I know what you're probably

thinking you're probably thinking I look

mighty tasty but I am here with a

business proposition for you know now I

am wanting to get into this butcher and

pie shop and cause a distraction and

while I do that I'm hoping that I could

convince you guys to go and back and eat

everything all right they transform

before your eyes into human rat hybrids

oh we're at and and they pick as they're

transforming they pick up weapons that

were hidden under the garbage around

them and crossbows and short swords I'm

gonna take out my spikes chain and use

like whatever combination of stahma tur

G and prestidigitation minor illusion to

make myself as scary as possible and

scream at them to try to scare them okay

roll initiative

I did not want Deardon to be a sterling

addition I'm so sorry

sent me off alone I could have sent you

with Alby I'm sorry the 24 okay

so describe to me what you want to do on

your turn you said you I'm gonna say

you've got the weapon out yeah so we're

casting a spell or to make yourself

scary or you're just using the weapon to

look scary I'm spinning the weapon above

my head and I'm probably going to use

like whatever spell to make it look like

it's like on fire and I'm gonna scream

at them really loud like so the spell

you're using on your weapon is uh like

just like a minor illusion yeah probably

all right okay and make uh I'll let you

make an intimidation jacket okay that is

a 20-3 okay

they kind of back away from you yeah

that's right

don't mess with me and I'm back out of

the alley okay and then I just run into

the shop you run into the shop slam the

door behind you when you peer through

the dirt encrusted window next to the

door you can see that those where rats

are peering out of the alley - they sort

of what they went out far enough to see

where you went - and then they seem to

be having a little conversation with

each other and then one of them keeps

watch while the other two disappear back

into the alley I'm going to use awakened

mind you say into its mind so what were

you talking about with your friends this

is a two-way conversation you're having

yeah it can respond to me I think that's

up to you but if it were - you can here

it is my is what I'm asking okay can you

yeah problem okay I think so I just I

just don't remember how the ability

works if we're going with the c-team

rules it does okay then it'll say that

is just getting more friends mmm I had a

very liquid lucrative proposal for you

but you decided to be all are you buying

anything says this loud voice behind you

they hear of the sound of an axe hitting

wood and you see this blood-stained

dragon born in a leather apron hacking

something apart with a cleaver I turn

around and I a smile I walk up to him

and say why yes I am here to purchase a

one pie please sir he shows you a shelf

that has

number of meat pies on it they look like

they've been sitting there for the

longer than a day there's a couple flies

around too and he's innocent

and he's got labels in common and drew

conic over each one like this is a

sausage pie this is a blob ha you know

all kinds of different kinds of meats in

here and he says pick your poison I'm

quite partial to nightshade or cyanide

are you trying to be cute no I'm not

from around here

none of us are and he will reach over

just take a pie pick one for you

basically slap it down on some paper and

wrap it up for you

thank you get out how much is the pie

he says you're gonna have that one for

free

oh well then I will have two pies the

next one will cost you three silver oh

that's it I'll take all your pies all

right he will wrap them up and so

they're like 10 pies out on display

three gold no I have that I will give

him three gold cool

have we been paying we have we have been

paying them right I I don't know so

you've got this big actually he'll get

since you're buying so many of them

he'll give you a small crate that he can

stack the pies in for you I will

actually like take one and taste it a

bit okay while I'm tasting it I want you

like on the DL cast

I think it's detect thoughts okay yeah I

want to basically just be able to read

his mind

and be like oh this is very good yeah he

so you try the pie

it's it's okay it's totally fine me pie

it's got a lot of flavor and it's been

it's

been soaking for a while so it's quite

an intense flavor but when you're

reading us to surface thoughts what you

get is those are all the old pies and

he's happy to get rid of them - some

crazy old bat who will want to eat them

those aren't the special pies mmm I've

heard you I've heard rumor that he uses

certain secret ingredients now I know

that you won't tell me I respect that

you must have trade secrets but I'm

maybe you can give me like a little hint

she says like putting another gold on

the counter he looks at it and says oh

you want my secret ingredient for gold

just a hint

he takes he looks around does he think

of the ingredient while he's listening

or thinking that is a good question yes

he does and the secret ingredient is

human and so I will take you and show

you I don't think I paid for that come

with me he goes he goes to a side door

leading deeper into the windmill come on

another customer could come any minute

I'm going to follow him a bit but I'm

going to look for anything that I can

light on fire that would maybe lead to

the entire building burning down the

buildings mostly made of stone so you

might set fire to a counter or a table

but that's about it or a shelf and he he

basically is waiting for you at the door

like taking you through your surface

thoughts so the surface thought you get

off him are pure malice you don't think

if you walk through that door you're

gonna walk out except for the fact that

I have three different ways of

teleporting

um how far into the room can I see you

can't it's dark beyond but you got dark

vision yes I do

so you can see some cold air coming out

of you'll feel some cold air coming out

of the room you can see that it is a

some sort of stone antechamber there's

not much to see from the angle through

the doorway but the smell coming through

it suggests that it's a larder you do

probably can see maybe a few hanging

meats carcasses nothing that you would

consider to be unwholesome like animal

carcasses mostly ah okay what I think

I'm going to do is I'm going to walk

towards him and right before going

through the doorway when I'm close to

him I'm going to cast thunder step to

teleport out of the building okay and

then use blessing of the Raven Queen to

teleport even further and then just run

away and can you can you use your

thunderclap without seeing the

destination is there not like a window I

can see through yeah I suppose if you

want to just basically transport outside

the window it's a pretty grimy window so

you can't see terribly far away but I

guess you could use the window to get

outside the building at the very least

yes okay mmm then I do another teleport

after that to get further away alright

he would be taking 3d10 damage from that

in the face unless he makes the Khan

save what's the DC that would be a 15

okay and you disappear at the same

moment that the thunderclap goes off yes

okay

so roll your damage does the clap

basically radiate in all directions

around you yes okay and that is sixteen

damage alright so as you disappear

there's a big clap there's also the the

sonic blast the kind of pushes or causes

things to disrupt it probably breaks the

glass on the

the display and other things around you

it might even if it's ten feet or more

the their area ah ten feet yeah you'll

probably blow out the window too so you

you teleport outside the window glass

sort of flies around you as you appear

outside of it you don't take any damage

from the glass okay and you can see in

the window that he has taken that damage

and is still alive and he's just

bellowing in a rage yeah and then I told

DS blessing of the Raven Queen as my

bonus action to teleport even further

oh I thirty feet and then I do another

30 feet of movements okay and we'll get

back to you shortly

Strix taught you so well how to run away

yeah DF and critter you get to the end

of the Miss Shore dock and you see a

hovel attached to what appears to be a

rundown little warehouse that's sort of

teetering on the brink of falling into

the harbor and this is you can see a

wizard sigil inscribed a jewel and

scribed upon the door that suggests this

is the residence of Grenda garl off kind

of looks like a little crab symbol great

well we're here so just the arrangement

should I be made for us we're going to

do a quick discussion get this

contraption that drill axel mentioned

then we'll go and get the likened it's a

it's just contraption more structurally

sound than this building you know I'm

really not super certain on that so

let's hope the best tell us good

strategy right right let's get this over

with okay when you go to knock on the

door the door opens just as your hand

Gordon and you see a woman Beyond with

spectacles on the bridge of her nose she

looks quite old maybe in her 60s and 70s

white hair done up in a bun although

it's kind of coming a little bit undone

and her wizard robes possibly regal in

the day look quite threadbare and worn

out now although there are still kind of

adornments on them that suggests they

were quite fancy and she looks at you

with her wrinkled face and says looks

around to make sure you weren't followed

it says come on okay I understand time

is of the essence yes of course then you

know who said to us yes she closes the

door he and I go way back and she gives

you a wink and a nod ah of course I was

just a young thing back then didn't know

what I was getting into

[Laughter]

oh yes and so does he

and he'll lead you to the warehouse back

where there is a device that looks like

a crab yes an apparatus made of metal

with periscopes and steel legs and

pincers with a hatch way in the back and

she says this this is my most prized

possession so try not to damage it and

bring it back when you're done

we will this shouldn't take long at all

I think I'm in love so and she will go

over to a wall and start cranking on

some ropes and some doors underwater

doors open on one side of this half

flooded warehouse that you're in and she

then goes over to another set of ropes

and they're like pulleys that lower this

thing down into the water once you're

inside I will undo the hooks and you'll

drop down to the bottom of the warehouse

and then go out through those doors into

the harbor the water stays out though

right once you're inside yes you should

be far

it's a tight excellent and is there a

way of acquiring stuff under water from

inside this contraption no you'll have

to get out oh that's your problem

but you can flush the water out once

you're back in oh good all right

and they thought of everything when they

built this thing yes yeah I assume one

of you have operated this one of these

things before so you know

oh yeah dozens of times yeah yeah mm-hmm

how do you yeah there's like six and

causeway see she'll she'll open up the

hatch and she'll point to there are ten

leaders in here there's a pirate there's

a pilot's chair and then there's a

co-pilot chair right behind it the the

pilot's chair basically controls the

legs and the copilot's chair can control

the pincers she tells you it's airtight

and watertight you can flush it out here

either turning that knob there's up to

10 hours of breathing of breathable air

in here so bear that in mind although I

won't expect you to take that long to

get some lichen you can go underwater to

as far down to the bottom of the harbor

as you want the pressure won't affect

you at all

and she says that lever is for the legs

and tail that leaver is for the

window-shutters that leaver is to also

for the window-shutters that's for the

claws that's for the presentation were

to attack with the claws that lemurs for

walking and swimming forward that's

returning left right that's for turning

on the lights

that's for lowering that's first ceiling

and opening the hatch excellent god jump

in the pilot chair tonight Dave actually

I say got it did I get it ain't all

information absolutely determined you

think you got it okay I think I got this

all right

she says there are sharks watch for

those got it and I've heard rumors that

a dragon has moved into the harbor watch

for that too it's just rumors for

probably fine

sailors rumors

you may also run into some merfolk they

come here from time to time to trade

with ships though I haven't seen one yet

this season okay alright okay well good

excuse me I need to get back to my

spellbook yes yes of course we'll return

shortly she leaves you alone in the

warehouse with the Dove with the

contraption

alright well I pull a lever well just a

random one roll of detail yeah

three three you open the side window

shutters oh wow look at the view

closer yeah yes and you can see at the

front through this sort of grill like

window regardless it's the side windows

that you were opening okay let's get the

crab okay so DFU hunkered down into the

seat behind critter yeah this is a lot

more cramped for me than it is for ya

yeah it's actually quite quite roomy for

him but for you your head your head

periodically tongue yeah all right so I

got control of crab claws yes

hell yeah all right hit the Lights

do you know which leaver that is uh

probably not

roll a d-10 one one all right yeah you

start to walk and swim forward or even

when there's progress actually no it

just extends the tail and the like so

actually since they're already extended

you retract the tail and the legs

Oh

and let's try another lever the hatch

opens oh yeah three shot okay maybe we

should switch I got them I got this all

right yeah I think I'd point out to him

which one does which yeah I'm gonna do

the thing where is like yeah you got

this and as he's like struggling it's

that one the other ones like the guiding

hand yeah all right and as we're

traveling around and starting to swim

just need the crab claws let's go all

right so you take this thing out and it

swims out into the dark Harbor it's very

very dark this water you can't see more

than I bleed in front of you activating

activating crab lights and I point to

the light letter for him to get you pull

the lever the lights come on and behold

you can see about 60 feet ahead of you

great you can see there are there are

the struts barnacle covered struts for

old docks there's all kinds of sunken

crap here that's been picked through old

nets and lobster traps that have been

cast aside you could actually see a

corpse like a skeleton picked clean by

fish lashed chained by a manacle to a

block of cement somebody who got thrown

down here and left down here to die back

them up yeah exactly

I don't know and you you sort of make

your way through all the refuse out into

the deeper Harbor and the water there

sorry the the floor of the Harbor

plunges deeply it's a they call it

deepwater Harbor for a good reason once

you get past the docks it's like abyss

and you begin to descend down into this

abyss where periodically you see

barnacle-encrusted masts kind of

pointing upward that you were making

your way down toward there should be

round the area where look

for old wrecks yes yeah you don't think

you'll have to go too far out into the

harbor to find this white lichen but as

you make your way deeper down deeper

down deeper down with your lights on I'm

gonna have you make a perception check

[Applause]

9df your lights catch the glimmer of

what appear to be bright golden or

bronze scales of something swimming

something big swimming through the water

that's just just catches the light and

then sort of glances off the light and

disappears into the briny depths and you

see it's a tail kill the lights

killing lights you are now in complete

darkness

good now work harder to see I don't know

what that was but I want to bring any

other attention to us while we try to

hopefully are we so like navigating our

way down

yeah you're kind of making an angled

descent down yeah we have a general idea

of we're recording for now it's down

yeah I'll just go for little ways

without trying to bring too much

attention to ourselves also be quiet all

right okay just a little bit just a

little bit just sink yep you do hear

some weird sounds it's just like not as

though as the water around you as things

move sound does seem to travel through

the hull and so you can hear just sort

of clunking noises sounds that would

travel through the water and pass into

this thing but nothing nothing you would

it's a little strange to you at first

but then when you realize oh it's just

it's just harbour noise okay that that

you're just picking up it's all normal

but you are kind of sick because you're

a big metal contraption you do have air

inside you but you're very heavy you are

you can feel yourself sinking deeper and

deeper and deeper and deeper yeah that

feeling is really the only gauge you

have other than the angle you're

currently at to know that you are making

a descent good because you're getting no

information through the windows except

particles in the briny dark so you have

any idea where we're going here or are

we just gonna sink to about them and see

what happens give it like three to six

more seconds okay one two your your

vehicle hit something hard and immovable

and then flips and spins and then turns

upside down I don't think this is the

intended function of this vehicle you

are now sinking upside down in this

water actually make a Jared since you

got the pincers roll a d20 and a date

okay fifteen one of the your your port

side left side pincer hooks something

grapples it and we stopped falling got

it

oops turn on the lights lights click

turn on okay you appear to have been

caught in the rigging of some sunken

wreck and you're sort of you're kind of

in this weird I wouldn't call it a net

per se but this tangle of old ropes and

you're banging up against what appears

to be a yardarm

man this is terrifying and awesome all

at the same time good do I see any

lichen

no you haven't reached the bottom you

don't see any lichen on the on the

yardarm you don't see any lichen on

growing on the ropes and you're not far

enough down yet to see the bottom yes is

I'd be closer to the actual hull of the

ship yeah all right crab arms to

maneuver ourselves to be right side up

again you try but they're not that

dexterous oh wow

critter you got any ideas I'm gonna try

retracting the legs and the tail and see

if we're stuck on something maybe

they'll free us yeah when you retract

the legs in the tail that does seem to

untangle you and at this point it's

literally only the if the claw is no

longer gripping the the yardarm you

begin to fall again yeah and so as you

as you plunge down with your lights on

you crash through the hull of the ship

below you and find yourself because it's

all brittle and old now find yourself in

the hull the hold of an old ship do I

see any kind of chests or anything

vaguely looking like treasure because I

yes is really trying to retain his

excitement right now you you throw your

face up against the window to see if you

can scan anything just with the lights

of the vehicle make a perception check

to see what you see in the hole around

you well it's a natural one but I do

have expertise that's right you do with

that passively it's 21 okay you can see

that there is all kinds of debris down

here left by the ship as well as what

appears to be the remains of a ballista

that collapsed and fell into the hold at

one point and lodged behind the ballista

deaath you see what appears to be a

sunken chest I mean we should get that

right and yeah there's no there's like

there's like a skeleton

kind of draped half over it but it's old

and it means nothing obviously I've

never done any underwater treasure

finding I'll deploy the legs and tail

again you skitter us forward maybe I can

just like grab it with the claw let's

hold on to it while we could you need to

look for the lichen yep well let's push

push this forward game claw range okay

and DF will extend the claw kind of

through the ballista to try to grab hold

of the chest make another d20 roll with

a +8 bonus DF could I want you to know

I'm having the time of my life right now

17 all right you're able to reach in and

grab the chest or one side of the chest

with the claw fairly gently yeah

and begin to drag it out from underneath

the refuse the skeleton just sort of

falls away and breaks apart as the chest

is moved underneath it but you do have

it in your clutches can you imagine how

excited everyone's gonna be when we come

back with bonus treasure I mean do we

have to tell everybody about the bones

treasure well I mean what one-one

paulten just spend it all on wine well

know that somebody does come on it is in

no her lock you and Warrington come to a

dilapidated Tower in the trades ward

that looks like it has seen better days

it is it has suffered some great neglect

over the years it's a three-story stone

structure that leans slightly to the

north but the roof has been torn down

there might have been a cap on it at one

point and instead now there is kind of

like a garden growing up at the top of

the tower and very prominent among the

many bushes and things and Ivy spilling

down the sides of the tower you can see

what appears to be a large pear tree

surmounting the tower our last bit of

conversation is we're approaching the

base of the tower I'm just gonna say you

know mr. Mont on our return I would be

happy to craft some ammunition to your

exact specifications it shouldn't take

me no more than an hour rather adept at

metalworking here we are my rod is slack

jawed at this and says my good man you

have a deal let's get this done and and

right up to the door and just a big like

heavy knock on the front door all right

there is no answer it appears this

fellow might not be home well that's a

dreadful inconvenient shall we wait for

him Warrington looks around well I

suppose a couple people walk by they see

you this this tower faces the street try

knocking once more now give a like a

heavier knock this time mm-hmm no answer

well this is a conundrum thaumaturgy a

big booming hello on the inside

Barrington will put his ear up to the

door I don't hear anyone you must be out

on business hmm well that's unfortunate

yes

it'd be a rather risky storming or

Wizards Tower don't know what sort of

magic we'll find in there and not to say

against the law that would be I mean

above and beyond indubitably

but the tree is right there indeed what

does it say the tower does look rather

old I reckon it might fall down at any

minute I'm the strong enough wind I've

given a good old heave-ho are you

suggesting we we just take a arrest

against the side of this tower and give

it a nudge well it's worth a try I might

ask you one more question how good a

shot are you could you say cleave a

branch or two off that tree I say are

you saying I should discharge my firearm

in the street him I was only curious I

mean I have no idea how but the the

ordinance is when it comes to well

ordinances but my throwing arm is not

quite three stories a plan is forming he

pulls out his gun and as I say accept

him on the back and give me guidance yes

the exact lines were a plan is forming

he pulls out his gun

you always want to Ida no you see at

this point what will happen is I will

fire this weapon shoot down some pears

and then I will probably get arrested

which is if I hear your weapon distarch

what well I can I can make sure it's

silent dude magical silence there do

that even since I can't detect that

yes cuz I understand it it's the noise

more than anything but a lot of aliens

don't like well as long as you're not

going to be seen by anybody here well

let's give it a shot well if I'm seen by

someone let them arrest me you can take

the pair's back and get the pie done and

they can bail me out later that is quite

noble of you it's above and beyond in

your service to a pie competition but

well I've learned that this is quite an

unusual group so yes and this doesn't

work we'll just push the tower down Plan

B Plan B and I will cast silence alright

in the silence he will take potshots at

the pear tree reloading after every shot

first three are misses and he just blows

chunks of the tower off and and hits

some other tree no there's a thought of

it actually actually don't hear of me he

just mouthed something he digs out the

rest of the ammunition he'll take

another three shots misses all three

it's a tough I mean a pair you know he's

trying to shoot a pair off a tree that's

you know 40 feet off the ground I don't

know man he is a Commodore yeah yeah

ranch not a pair right branch down well

yeah he's trying to hit basically trying

to shoot a branch it's that's true and

so he's fired six shots and done some

damage to the tower but hasn't hit a

branch yet I'll drop silence and say hmm

Plan B it is I suppose yes I'm afraid

that was much harder than it seems this

weapon is not precision instruments at

that range of course only had a shotgun

he says I guess we'll go to plan B then

let's push this thing over oh dear and I

take a deep breath and lean up against

the tower and

follow his lead ah say you're helping me

then because I

help you oh whoa I quit to be quite

honest I think this is the first time I

may be breaking the law oh well sorry so

what is your strength poor luck 14 oh my

goodness okay hill-hill you can help him

okay as he tries to push the tower over

meanwhile in the city of the Dead

evylyn paltin Jarl axel the that you I

don't think any either of you have spent

any time here have you so the city of

the Dead is a walled off section of the

city you can get to it through big gates

it is water deeps graveyard but it's

huge it's immense and more than just a

graveyard it is the city's main park and

it is stunningly gorgeous beautifully

landscaped all the bushes are tended the

grass is trimmed the trees have got all

of their leaves on them now and so it's

no mere drab Cemetery and you can see on

grassy hills and near flowerbeds all

kinds of picnickers and people just sort

of enjoying it there's a young family

with a baby carriage rolling through

down a cop down a cobbled Trail you can

see sculptures carved out of some of the

bushes near a few of the more grand

mausoleums gravel paths that you can

follow and Relaxo leads you along one of

these paths to a mausoleum around which

these wildflowers grow that he describes

as Helio Donna's and as soon as you see

them evylyn you're struck by them

because they look like little Suns and

they actually glow with the light with

the with the warm radiant light of the

Sun in the most beautiful way evens like

in soft focus like a you know like when

color first came to the movies and a

close-up she's just like smelling a

flower and she's like hey leo Donna's I

love them thank you for bringing me here

oh and she's just skipping around and

playing and

enjoying everything and asking him tons

of questions yep and he'll he'll tell

you that he'll tell you that he

discovered them during his visit to the

city long ago but they only bloom in the

spring so this is really late spring

early summer it's the only time to

really see them so he's glad that he was

able to bring you out here at this time

and he he tells you that he has always

been intrigued by the Sun oh I love

talking about the Sun what do you like

about it most of my people of curls do

not abide the Sun they they dwell deep

underground fire as far away from it as

they possibly can but I have always been

strangely drawn to it

it's its warmth it's light it's its

timelessness hmm oh you like I had no

idea hold on I take out the Sun store

and just activate it like right next to

his face like to check this thing I

should like it you might like that isn't

this wonderful he says yes I have three

myself but and he goes back to talking

about the Sun that's it away yes all

right well that was the only shtick I

had planned for this so how does one

come upon three Sun swords and discover

flowers and no a food critic I mean you

you're so unique he says I enjoy life to

its full and I have spent a great deal

of time here on my surface in fact

probably longer than either of you well

now that I think about it but I have

made it my home here this is where I

always feel like I belong with with

beauty that's so beautiful isn't it

wonderful to find a place where you feel

like you belong

yes indeed very much sir how did you

find it once you once you you know set

out into the world looking

that place where you belong how did you

know that you found it well at first it

was this far from the from the corrupt

matriarchy of my deep home of men's

Oberon's on a city run by the

priestesses of love who are insane I

know anything about love yeah she's a

demon queen of spiders I mean I do but

does evil enlike yeah she would know

yeah you would know that glow fairly

common knowledge and he says that does

not that's lifestyle they are the

predatory nature of life in men's

oberyn's and it's not what I was hoping

for

so I originally came up here like many

droughts to raid the surface and to play

on those who live here but that is that

is beneath our dignity as elves well

that's very high-minded way of thinking

and so I have struggled all my life to

escape and help others escape from the

tyrannical matriarchy that is they

follow else of love and to look upon

other faiths as and and and try to find

in them something to cling to have you

heard about Lysander I have heard a

little bit about Lysander yes and would

long to hear more over there is the

statue of over and over there is the

statue of a Goran here's the city's

founder and they also what worse

monument over there Appleton something

you might be interested in is there was

a family of bouts who are laid to rest

here I could take you to their mausoleum

if you like I'll I'll pass and then

he'll just take evil in an arm and say

so tell me more about nothing down Oh

our great mourning Lords surely is just

like the Sun warm and inviting and

shining upon him you say it's off as

they walk yeah paulten make a perception

checked

[Music]

that would be a 15 okay you as they walk

off you see that you are being followed

by some shady leather-clad

all dressed in black spies

you've seen their the cut of their jib

before they are gent Arum hmm they must

have they must have followed you into

the city of the Dead and you can see

them hiding among some gravestones and

behind a mausoleum but you just catch

sight of them a couple there there two

of them that you see a man and a woman

keeping an eye on you so like as as like

even and relaxed so like just kind of

like walk off and I watched him walk

away until they're no longer like

audible I just kind of turn around I'm

like can I help you guys with something

they pull out heavy crossbows and shoot

you

it is Tuesday oh ok so one of them

rolled a rose at 24 and one of them crit

you so evil and Jarl Axl you turn around

as palton gets shot ok so you take 8

points of damage from one crossbow bolt

and 15 points of damage from the other

for a total of 23 cool there's just like

big crossbows in my body I'd yeah like

turnarounds like alright so whenever

y'all are done takes the crossbows and

just goes and then the laser hands ah

it's okay it's okay duck that no harm

done

you're fine out the exit wound

yeah okay that's how much how much is 15

and 8:23 you don't know how much damage

you can't translate damage per that

precisely but you can decide in order to

heal the damage like you need to do 25

points worth oh yeah okay okay so yes

the wound was quickly closed up however

there are still the holes in your

costume oh no are you wearing the party

jacket I always am yeah

so there's don't see the holes in the

jacket this is like oh now you done

 up now you know you know amending

contra probably enough to fix that but I

mean appearances you have to walk home

with this it's on principle yes but in

the chaos of evil and healing you the

two who shot you are no longer in sight

it appears they shot you and bolted

would I be able to

[Music]

locate creature them yes

let me see it's uh what would I be

familiar enough with them to do that

well you saw them so yes cool I just

need to check to make sure that you can

cast the spell quickly yeah it's one

action yeah so you can see as long as

they're within a thousand feet of you

which they would be unless they

dimension toward away or something you

can bear in on either the man or the

woman doesn't matter and yeah you can

you can tell that they are moving away

with you from you with great haste are

we getting them are we gonna go get them

now okay

I assume the nod was a yeah Charlotte

Charlotte Souls says you know if you

like I can dispose of them for you oh

well that's nice it's not nice palton

not good enough let's go oh well you can

come with Charl axle okay

and he will follow you even takes to the

air yeah one helicopter version of evil

and you can see the two Shantaram they

have converged with two others and the

four of them are moving briskly toward

one of the gate exits while trying not

to attract too much attention they're

trying to stay out of the public view so

they're moving around bushes away from

the main paths and things like that I

mean just points as she flies holding

also just like yell it's like everyone

pay attention to them those are bad guys

not my friend they they hurt fashion a

mockery of life designer but evil and

you can certainly catch up to them when

you're flying because they're moving

around obstacles you're not yeah so I

will I want to slow them all down so

that my friends can catch up so can I

attempt to like bowling-ball them

I like all four of them

that would be hard to do you could knock

one of them over I want it well alright

well then it looks like there they are

and cast Moonbeam right on okay so like

also serve as a flare for where they are

okay now that's a damaging spell so you

can roll damage that's two d-10 unless

you amp it up no I don't really want to

like fry them I just want to stop them

okay okay that is 17 okay yeah you badly

badly burned them and they they stopped

and starts screaming out in pain

you shot my friend that's what happens

there they are

you also incinerated in your Moonbeam a

couple are there flying snake companions

who were on their person oh so they

weren't snakes flutter down to the

ground and you're able to catch up to

them palton so yeah as they crawl out of

the Moonbeam he's like trying to say

something but like running they keep up

with the evens like Dix ask them why

they did that yeah why they

look at you and say we're just following

orders whose orders one of them badly

badly burned says earth stole flaxen why

does Ursula flotsam want to hurt paltin

Hobson Watson you he's trying to get the

ring how many times do we have to go

over I don't have the ring he doesn't

believe you well can I talk to him uh

well yes cool we'll have to ask him we

could set up a meeting

yeah is there like a secretary like

j-just tell you are you gonna come back

to me like yeah we'll come back to you

but like this time maybe not like guns

blazing and stuff just like with a time

and date they help each other to their

feet badly badly burned by the the

energy of the Moon beam and they said

yeah yeah well we'll talk to her Stoll

and we'll set up a meeting and come tell

you when and where he wants to meet you

you're really gonna do that you just

shot him do I believe them her oh my

goodness I Jack okay it sounds

convincing to me they seem I don't know

they seem honest it was like him it was

like a seven okay they seem like honest

no do batters lying pieces of garbage

but that's fine can I try the insight

absolutely

sixteen okay you can kind of get a read

on them there they're mostly just

interested in survival but in order to

survive they are willing to tell or

still whatever they have to and honestly

they'd have a no they have no personal

stake in in this ring thing they're just

trying to do their job so they they will

probably do what they have but what they

say all right you all do what you said

now yeah yeah let them know Tuesday's

are best for me okay they will go

limping off away from you at this point

I even kind of dust herself off and like

a lights on the ground and Oh turns off

the moon beam sorry about that Joel Axl

we just sometimes you know really

involved in the community here and

things just sometimes you know there are

business things we have to deal with

didn't ya tell you to ask him something

right yes that seems like a very awkward

time for me to do that right now but I

suppose since you brought it up that

would be fun I just got shot we got

strung in it's troubling she probably

asked you Garlock said oh just say there

will be other times you don't don't

worry about it

we we should get the back okay cool yes

and who knows if they're if these ones

came after you there might be more of

them threatening your friends I mean

point in time I'm leaving Strix to her

work you're doing great Strix thank you

it's all I want

alright Strix make a performance check

charisma based which is kind of your

strong stuff yeah alright that's hold on

so you then I add just the basic

charisma bonus add your charisma and

then d4 for the guidance is that right

yeah yeah and your being and and your

being assisted so you can make another

role see if that's hot it's not 21 21

okay so yes you through the night as DF

is a hog lean over his chest you let you

let the pie bake the scent of the pie

wafts through the Waffle House and it

smells absolutely delightful and when it

comes out you're very very proud of it

yay and I made it look pretty too this

time and Jarl Axl says he has some

things to deal with when night falls he

is a night creature as he says and goes

out to amuse himself leaving you alone

wait you said you'd pay us extra Oh

finding out it was people absolutely he

will and he is he's very grateful he

would not have thought of people and so

yeah well he will give you he will give

you a beautiful purple velvet pouch in

which is contained 30 platinum pieces

what I will give them I'll give everyone

else 5 isn't that for the company it all

don't work I almost

dear now almost died it's fine we've all

almost and also repeatedly died yes I

will give paltin one platinum piece and

another glass of wine and stir and relax

we'll lean in districts and says and if

you ever want a secret partner witness

in dev oh I'd be happy to help fund with

this operation that you have taught me

all right that would be great I don't

know what money is can you talk to DF I

will go talk with you yes all right the

next day Jerell axel will return with

ranzan shobha a half-elf

sort of heavyset half elf pie critic and

have you done anything to dress up the

waffle house

I've probably asked evylyn to make it

look nice Oh

evylyn made it insta perfect yeah she

has like a Welcome Packet for him when

he comes in the house talking about the

historical significance of the waffle

house and how it inspires the food and

lists all of the hashtags that are

frequently used to describe the shop and

then put some tablecloths down and stuff

yep some flowers and there's candles but

like the candles are only the candles

like Strix uses for spells so they're

all just like black and kind of trippy

took his chest up into his room but

hasn't opened it yet okay savoring

savory it's just so excited it's like he

can't open the present yeah it is it is

exactly sort of the picture-perfect sea

chest that death always imagined finding

as a kid and it's full of spiders yes

so rat ranzan will have a seat and he'll

tuck in his bib and draw his own

utensils of course and and wait for the

the pie to be presented before him and

you can see there are a couple

sycophants who are kind of with him they

just sort of hover off in the distance

one's got a little notepad to take down

every word that he says

all right um yeah Strix I guess she'll

deliver Turks will deliver the pie but

chill before she does she'll actually

use prestidigitation on herself to clean

herself up

okay like she will actually be clean

very good I'm like kind of pull her hair

back like when it was in the fancy fancy

ball kind of episode episode and so

she'll actually be clean and her clothes

still be kind of messed up but she

doesn't smell bad right now

so she'll deliver the pie all right and

he will begin to eat it and as he does

he closes his eyes and and then after

taking a couple bites he takes his

handkerchief often sets it down beside

him and he stands up and he looks at you

and then strix he grabs you and kisses

you on the cheeks do that

and she's like what was that for that's

was for giving me the perfect pie yeah

we can stop pretending to be put

together and then he bursts then he

bursts into flames and becomes a and and

cringes falls back into his chair as a

charred corpse what was that the price

that happened and his assistants drop

everything that they're holding and run

screaming out the door I know I know it

was it there was nothing in it there was

nothing bad in it I made it

Strix Strix your pie was lit bro

and that's where all stop

he appears to have died the same way as

father Luke sunbright that's great no it

was really wholesome until that moment I

thought that maybe you just burst into

flames because his life was complete and

that's how I wanted to die yeah like I

have another reason to live I'm out yeah

murder again but Karl Axl tells you that

he'll clean up the mess great oh can I

tell Jerell Axl can you get his

assistant so they know that like I

didn't kill him oh they're already dead

but you know what at this point like

this guy at this point shirt

could I be quiet and he says as I said

the only thing you need to know about me

is I don't like to lose next Tuesday

yeah but before then what's happening oh

wait pack South the waffle crew is

convening for a very special live
