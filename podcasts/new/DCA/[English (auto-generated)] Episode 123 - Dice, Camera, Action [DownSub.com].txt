hello 2019 this is dice camera action

edition this is gonna be a good year all

of you shush Anna's gone he's just gone

there she's back is this still horrible

all right let's see it's been several

weeks since we last convened so let's

see if we can't summarize where things

are at currently previously in dice

camera action the waffle crew settled in

water deep and acquired a state from one

Magnus Burnside's

which they turned into a bakery and

repository for all of their collected

junk and friends and they are currently

residing there with let's see a gif

Commodore named Warrington Mundt and a

decrepit albino beholder kid named Albie

and a severed withered old hand named

Andrew and a kid who used to be a puppet

but is now a real boy named Simon three

street urchins named shanks NAT and

squiggly and a owl bear named waffles

what is a home but a repository for junk

and friends right yeah and when you put

it like that it sure sounds a lot worse

in the course of settling in their new

abode and getting accustomed to the

frenetic lifestyle of Waterdeep the crew

ran afoul of several local villains

managed to dispatch one of them a

beholder crime lord names Anitha whose

organization in a way DF is kind of

absorbed

but other villains have her and the

waffle crew of late

including a faction of drow who have

menaced them pistol wielding drow I

might add a sort of spectral shadow

organization called the gent Arum which

seems to be at least in part under the

leadership of an evil wizard named

mansion who has an artificial hand and

have apparently run afoul of an infernal

society or family or organization of

some kind for they have been beset by

imps they encountered and slew a

Rakshasa and took a book written in

infernal from its residence which was

promptly stolen from them by

previously-mentioned imps and on one

occasion the Strix was summoned away by

the acquisitions Inc crew to help rob a

bank which was owned and operated by a

noble family called the castle lanters

who have two young children who were

looked after by a tiefling nanny who

visited the waffle crew recently to buy

some of their fine pastries

I think they were spying on us they may

have been spying thank you all right

an invitation arrives at the Waffle

House for all of you to come and pay a

visit to Lord and Lady Castle enter in

their home in the C Ward the invitation

promises that this is an informal

meeting so come as you are bring what

you will and light meal will be served

but nothing fancy and they would like to

make you a proposal one of

reconciliation they tell you to that

they will send a coach to fetch you

should you wish to attend you just need

only hop in the coach and you will be

born safely to the castle enter

residence if you have concerns they tell

you don't worry there will be a member

of the city watch on hand to make sure

everyone behaves is this like a written

invitation it is do we each individually

get one or was it one envelope one

envelope for the house but we're all

aware of it at this point already yes

all right so Poland's just like all

right new year new house new rules all

invitations immediately go in the trash

we don't I thought you liked parties no

don't trust anyone anymore

everything is awful last time we got an

invite last like five times we got an

inflates um where people tried to kill

us so I'm starting to pick a pattern

yeah uh but I sort of accidentally

robbed their bank even more reason uh

but I think it might come get us form

anything a mistake is started thinking

and that's when things go wrong when we

think everything's awful so let's just

stop thinking and say you know what

let's

too soon everything is out to kill us

I've been doing that this whole time

thank you for finally agreeing with me

but now but but now I'm saying we should

establish like a rule system to abide by

it and you know what I'm sorry you were

right the whole time yay so let's go

ahead and just permanently lock all the

doors you know throw out all the keys oh

that's a good idea I don't know why I

know we never locked the doors find dark

corners to just curl up in and just stay

there that's what I do all the time

right

you get you've man you're way ahead of

the game damn all right why don't we

listen the stress more looks at everyone

else like proud of herself Pollock she

does have 50 years of experience of

hiding yeah I love parties personal

offering a reconciliation I think it's

something we should consider

I just love parties reconciliation for

what No

and reconciliations we've done a lot a

lot has been done to us also true I

don't want them to come after us that's

a problem that's more for the watch

we'll be there

if the watch is there we'll be fine yeah

it's hard be there does it say on the

invitation it does not mention well the

interpretation is currently in the trash

do you read it she just heard fountain

Rita so she asked Paulson and Todd was

mentioned Todd's dead but like but like

he's like like everyone was like cool

with it it was like a chill thing they

had like a little party and stuff like

that weird that you didn't get invited

to that either way is this one of those

like sarcasm things you do that I'm

supposed to like get that it's a joke

why you're doing it again aren't you no

no he's doing it right now okay oh well

this is going on well this is happening

Commodore Munt is sort of moving his

stuff out from the basement up into the

attic room that he's

kind of setting aside for himself saying

the whole time that the higher ceilings

really are necessary well why don't we

just bring Warrington and a gun why do

you want to come to the party with us

oh my of course yes come they're not

gonna mess with us when we bring him

these are weird giant hippo man a party

do you hear that Pippin any punches you

really hard see Warrington can be our

plus one

Chris help me refresh my memory about

the castle lanters were they involved

with this don't ogle or at all and lady

lady La Roche NAR yes yes really I thank

you

well possibly because they you believe

that they've had imp invisible imp spies

infesting your house yeah they

doubtlessly know a great deal about

what's happened there and also you

recall that the they they were the ones

who you believe tampered with the unseen

servants in your house right yeah

remember that yeah mister trying to

remember if we've done any but you

haven't had any direct dealings with

them on any sort of personal level

except restricts robbed their bank

correct that and they weren't there

right do you mean you actually take any

money

no no so technically she didn't robbing

no I just visited it but we're not

invited it was just an attempted robbery

it was it up ultry breaking and entering

I mean oh man it was all men's fault

anyway oh yeah it definitely was yeah he

came to the window at the bakery and

just stood there like a creep

wait omen was here it was awhile ago but

he didn't want to come in I'm pretty

sure because D of hates her D act no I

mean you know to be fair he's you know

like horrible need to give oh man a

break he threw a great Christmas party

for us

that's true but you weren't at the pack

show

look let's just go and bring in

Warrington it'll be fine and if anything

gets bad I can just teleport us back

home right it's easy for us to escape

and if they do have any problems with us

if anything else this is us getting

information on them if you have

suspicions upon us we can try to deduct

or deduce as much as we can from

whatever it is because something's going

on here and I don't like it yeah I can

go and dress up and have fun and

socialize and dia can deduce right all

of our favorite pastimes okay so just

the going for the usual paltin recap of

all the stupid going on every time

we get invited somewhere someone tries

to kill us someone invites us somewhere

and our thought is we should probably go

yeah but yeah but hear me out hear me

out oh god I want to hear what it this

time it's different

it might be I didn't think of that

Strix will just turn to Warrington and

just be like just bring your biggest gun

and your fanciest coat right in and

we're gonna go to a party there's what I

have a coat but as a recall my fancy gun

was destroyed recently in that

altercation at a men's farm rather

another one not yet no you can wear your

party Bolton's like already wearing his

party I don't need an occasion

well Warrington you hit hard so it'll be

fine yes and he cracks his knuckles okay

good great look we have this should

anything actually happened to us we have

ways of getting ourselves out of danger

nothing else try to stay as close as

possible to strict so as soon as things

go poorly she can you immediately

teleport us out over there another idea

is I can literally I could death ward

all of us before we even go in why don't

we do that I will death warned all of us

before we go in yeah and I still have

connections to the open Lord of

Waterdeep so if something goes very

poorly here the last thing the castle

enters want to do is have the ire of

open Lords of Waterdeep and I'm best

friend

with the black staff so I go get my gun

I'm just like schlump saw it's gonna I'm

starting a trend sad it like puts his

sword on like it starts like getting all

his equipment and Strix is like on fire

also wasn't the gun destroyed yeah the

gun that's squidly and oh that's right

remembers part way there he's like yeah

it's Chad I know many people have

already said it calm down Oh before I

forget I also I wanted to take time to

identify those rings that I got off of

XANA thar cuz I had those from Zanna

Tharp and might helpful us if we're yes

you know yeah they're doing something

there were three rings correct yes okay

now in order to identify them you're

going to need three pearls worth at

least a hundred gold pieces each I can't

just use my smart nope mom never mind I

just put him in my room I murdered I'm

like get back to these later don't put

them on kids deaath are you going to Don

your badge or keep that hidden I had

that on all the time but I'm trying to

figure out where I'm my person it'll be

like stashed away that way any time I

can I can like do the whole flash things

like Keith Woodrow should watch like

I've got that like hidden yep I'm

equipped to it I'm attuned to it oh well

yeah there was a wand to thank you they

was also wand I don't know if the wand

was where'd you get that there was a one

I don't remember where it was whatever

Strix lost it no that was a different

that was the wand of conducting yeah

yeah whatever it's gone it's gone if I

forget it's tricks lost it she's like is

this just er soup and it's gone alright

so it doesn't take long for the coach to

show up and it bears you through the

streets warning tenacity inside it so he

will just kind of hang on to the back

good so it'll be a fun scene are we

sitting in the carriage but all kind of

at an angle because of the weight yes

yeah yeah every time every time you hit

a bump you almost go headlong into evil

and I'm getting super motion sick uh

just get bruises in our heads from evil

ins Armour okay yes so you're going with

all of your accoutrements with the hippo

man hanging off the back what

instructions if any did you give the

kids or are you bringing any of them

with you such as say Simon neighbor oh

the elf elf gardener across the street

and the kids are like I'm gonna have

somebody make a persuasion check to see

if they can convince her to open up the

door paulsen please already history New

Year so that would be 21 alright they

open the door and let the kids in is it

like a thing where before I even say

anything they just slam the door yes and

we definitely lock the doors and make

sure that all of our wards are in place

and make sure waffles is safe do we

bring Simon no Simon is also a child oh

I forgot like so after dropping the kids

off I'd go back to the carriage it's

like okay actually Simon would like to

make a case to you Politan that he

should come along because he has he has

spent a little bit of time at the castle

and

two kids and maybe and he says maybe

maybe maybe they'll tell me things about

their parents that they wouldn't tell

you yeah that's a good idea

I like crouched down to him I'm just

like all right son well now you have to

make what's called a persuasion right

here right now he has to learn

eventually he rolls a 12 Paul I like

looks up and like considers I'll allow

it

hey we get back to the carriage and I'm

just like okay so the kids are in the

house um not sure if that was

babysitting or abduction but the waffle

crew doesn't know is there's like this

half-orc assassin who actually lives

there - yes he'll hop in and sit between

death and pollen all right yes so you

make your way along wrist sticks tricks

your staff also you have to kind of

wedge it in at a certain angle to get it

into the coach so it's kind of like this

now crossbeam between she doesn't

transform it so it's funny or just to

make it inconvenience for everyone all

right and castle enter villa has stark

white walls and gleaming crimson roof

and turrets that stand out even among

the other residences in the C Ward the

three-story mansion lies in the midst of

a picturesque green garden dappled with

hedges and water features the estate is

surrounded by a tall white brick wall

with a single iron wrought gate at the

entrance and you can see the castle

enter family crest a green why

overlapping a stylized goose being hand

fed is emblazoned on the gate armored

guards stand at

tension on either side but as the coach

pulls up the guards step forward to open

the gate to open the doors of the coach

to lower the steps and to help you out

as you will are there any real gays cuz

Strix is looking for real keys no but

you do see crows flying around the

rooftops and couple eyes of the mansion

ok mom enough throw them some snacks

ok they ignore them no I shake my fist

[Laughter]

all right the guards open up the gates

and allow you to proceed in toward the

main mansion as you make your way to the

entrance you cans

[Music]

recently when evylyn was out at one of

her many jeonse to the spires she met

some new friends and they had a shopping

day and she came back with a new dress

thanks girls got scullery so she's

wearing a nicer version of that sundress

that she had that was super rowdy that

she got from the spot after her clothes

were stolen right yes this one looks

like a nicer more appropriate like a

paladin warrior wear but fancy and

embroidered and a dress and she can wear

her armor over that yeah ok it's it's

like almost exactly the same as what she

was wearing out that dress but it looks

more appropriate as opposed to this like

random like resort wear that she had

excellent no one can tell but evylyn yes

right you can see you can see

beautifully sculpted topiaries about in

the in the yard you can also see what

appear to be atriums and butterfly

gardens with all sorts of beautifully

colored butterflies fluttering around in

the air in fact one probably lens on the

brim of Strix is hat

I panic okay but you make it to the

front door and there are these knockers

that kind of look like devilish faces

yeah well big message being sent with

these so who wants to touch them they're

here I'll just take my staff and just

like lift one of them up with the point

Klunk Klunk wait before we do that and

go any further yes

does udemy a sort of divine sense in

here are you feeling any evil or fiends

or the like I am I'm sensing a lot of

hostility behind those doors

hold on Greg with a endure please bestow

on me a sense of of your divinity and of

my surroundings and bless my friends

because I love them and they're so sweet

and so cute and don't you love them to

levander I know they love you too and

you're real nice and thank you for the

sunlight amen praise be alright

and according to divine sense it allows

you to pick up Celestials fiends and

undead within 60 feet of you that is not

behind total cover damn right of course

I'm death warning everyone while she's

blathering okay but even then even

standing the other side of the story you

can't read anything through the doors

okay but you do sense the presence of

multiple fiends and they you what's that

it does say as an action you can detect

good and evil

yeah aware so I see so is the function

of detecting evil just knowing the

location of any celestial fiend or

Undead

so which ability you're looking at just

on divine sense okay as an action you

can detect an evil until the end of your

next turn you can sense anything

affected by the house though or no the

patient of any saw steel fiend or undead

within sixty feet that's not behind

total cover which would be that door

yeah you can use this feature six times

per block okay I guess broadly you could

say you can just sort of sense the the

evil in the area okay but I know I keep

it until I get inside but I'm right yes

but you are sensing evil and you tracks

up to the crows that are circling around

the top of the house evil and shake

surfaced at the crows now you know birds

yes

the ultimate sign when they circle lots

of evil and bad things that want to kill

us we should go there detecting us

fiends to you you don't know why maybe I

think I'm gonna kill them all they

didn't take my snacks

yeah probably cuz they're evil and your

snacks are delicious and good and sweet

oh well that's nice well let's just get

I don't start killing random fiends I

feel like maybe that's why they're mad

at us in the first place uh let's just

let's just oh it's a good idea they

could belong to the castle enters

themselves lesson we want to do is any

kind of aggression towards them before

we even arrived alright but afterwards

we're getting rid of these evil arts

just everyone stay on your toes let's go

in alright Strix does her little trick

with the staff to get the knocker to

clap down the door opens soon thereafter

and you see a very tall very thin and

immaculately dressed tiefling older

tiefling gentleman demon people whose

place is evil

very very gives me this this sort of

frightfully thin lurch like tiefling

glares down at you you can see a pair of

spectacles perched on his hawkish nose

as he gazed at you looks you all over

and says I'm sorry we don't need our

chimneys cleaned today alright sorry to

bother you sir we'll just lay back when

a gift

we do that was great Simon Says how

about your clock oh good one

as chief leagues like what are you

saying you're not chimney sweepers uh we

all just kind of stand be like we were

invited we're here for dinner I think uh

Oh Oh then well come on in that's for

sure sure at one time would just like

not to you know maybe some enthusiasm

when we show up somewhere not oh it's

them or oh no here they come or those

are the people that burn my house down

she looks at you as you go by strikes as

you're talking and he just says I see

landed on the outside that was yours he

closes the door behind you

run stay close I like talk to him just

like see like do you just let anyone in

who says they're invited you know that's

like is there no like verification

process or do you know that's fine

science wing we even have any

identification like do we have like

watered avian IDs or something no no

well show you enough things most people

start to learn who you are Simon will

say uh mister is Terenzi O&L zarina home

yes they're upstairs with their nanny

I'm gonna go see if I'm gonna see if you

know I'm gonna go say hi it's okay if I

go see hi yeah go play with your friends

have fun child Simon all right hey he'll

run off between the legs of the tall

tiefling and just run upstairs looking

looking for his two little friends maybe

next time eh but don't call him child

Simon absolutely correct human even

thank you friend palton human you are

led into a room with two figures in it

one is

a man who is playing a harpsichord

somber tune on this golden harpsichord

in a corner standing not too far away by

a large open bay window that looks out

over the gardens is a woman tall and

willowy both the man and the woman are

exquisitely dressed immaculate in their

attire their hair beautifully coiffed

the woman appears to be a human the man

appears to be a half-elf you can see his

ears have slight points to them and as

the tall tiefling introduces or

announces your presence the man stops

playing the harpsichord and turns to

face you and you see that he is a he's

got a short beard neatly trimmed

mustache and sort of reddish copper

colored hair dark darker complexion the

woman is got a little fan that she's

just sort of waving in her face because

actually it is kind of a warm late

spring day the the chief Ling manservant

leaves and closes the door behind him

leaving you alone with the couple and

the gentleman gets up out of the

harpsichord walks over to you extends a

hand to UDF unit see there are gold

rings on it

he's also he picks up a walking stick as

he makes his way over to you it seems to

be more of an affectation than a need he

doesn't seem to have any problem walking

but he carries himself with this stick

and it's made out of gold with a ruby

tip right it's a status symbol exactly

does that seem familiar to me um you

didn't make a religious you can make a

religion check if you dare I sure AM

Alton takes out his little walking stick

who's like oh yes is Ravan yep yes

23 okay you know that the lord of the

nine hells as modeis

is known to wield a scepter slash

walking stick that has a ruby at its tip

I sure do I'm not gonna say anything yet

but I'm gonna like make eyes at everyone

and really kind of obviously though

because I'm really bad at that it's like

hello my name is Victoria castle and a

pleasure to meet you at last

strict you have something in your eye do

you need yeah sorry

ah home is your home please any jesters

to a table a large table deaath will

take his hand and shake it and just say

the death would row evylyn curtsy is

very like with full etiquette cuz she

comes from this noble background and

knows exactly how to act in these fancy

situations pleasure to be in your home

thank you so much for inviting us Oh

Mike

like does a little bow holding up lies

case like Halton SEPA pleasure to meet

you mr. jack-o'-lantern Strix just

stares and makes this face castle at

Victoria Castle anta yes centaurum

jacqueline

you're very funny yeah funny people are

necessary to this world they should live

you can see for the first time often a

corner you didn't see there's a third

person in the room sitting in a large

high-backed chair near a fireplace that

is not lit look just sort of thumbing

through a book he was in shadow before

but now that you can see more clearly he

appears to be a man a member of the city

watch Oh

compared to Stroud Vaughn chair of itch

how fancy is the chair it's it's bigger

in terms it's in its scale is but it

doesn't have this sort of Gothic

grandeur it's a little bit more stark

you know size isn't everything

so Strix is gonna gain a bit of courage

for a second and sort of walk up to to

him and like offer her hand to shake uh

you're the one who tried to rob my bank

not technically be my company that I

freelance for but uh I was just gonna

say I've met someone that has a similar

a cane as you do have you now huh yeah

Asmodeus the lord of the nine house they

the husband and wife look at each other

and smile and she says we owe

well-acquainted with him Oh us too

unfortunately fortunately for you we

would not be rude if they're like if

you're family or anything he's little or

benign house evil and he Victorio says

has there ever been a man so

misunderstood I see that this is gonna

go great huh

and she says she smiles and says we have

been following his work for some time

and have found him to be extremely

generous

kind-hearted very giving to those he

considers to be important and in his

circle he is not someone to fear kind of

instrumental in your adoption right

Strix

I mean yeah but yes yes and there is no

but greatest evil of mud are you

possessed oh yes but but what is evil I

mean really I mean evil is evil and I

think evils a matter of perspective I

agree speaking of that all right before

you label any of us evil

oh no labels here they're label free

zone this is a safe space fair

evylyn am i right correct

pleased to meet you pleased to meet you

as well my dear so you'll be pleased to

hear that we have made several generous

donations to your temple over the years

and provided more than abundant supply

of gold to ensure the future of said

temple and the personages within you can

ask when you get back to Dacia temple

superiors just how generous we have been

over the years that's lovely

I think generally when when you make a

generous gift I'm particularly pleased

with how you run your orphanage programs

children are our future after all that

is so true I completely agree well at

least we can agree on that even like

keeps opening her mouth to like comment

or say yes and she looks at Diaz like

hello

perhaps we can dispense with these

customary pleasantries says lady Castle

enter and get down to why we've called

you here that would be nice yeah remote

yes yes discussion the conversation or

have

already inconvenienced them enough

Victoire oh and he says quite right

quite right but seriously though if

you'd like to know more about Asmodeus

and his good deeds i'd be then he looks

at his wife and then looks back at you

more than pleased to talk about it maybe

another time it would be a fascinating

conversation to have

I'm sure if you got like a wiki link or

something we can check that out when we

get home like I'm good under the

circumstances you might be wondering why

we're not trying to kill you given that

you stole a very important book that

belonged to a friend of ours and tried

to rob our bank

Oh your friend was the evil one you're

so there's that word again it's like so

so you said not trying to kill us it is

what is said correct Victoria says well

even if we wanted to I'm afraid we can't

that's right

well that's all I need I can't you what

questions here because well you should

know that I am a devotee of the lord of

the nine hells I'm not not generally

something I'm willing to admit openly

and he he looks at the captain in the

chair over there and he looks back to

you but just between us I don't think

there should be any secrets particularly

given how much we know about each other

now

some years ago our family powerful as we

have become did fall on hard times we

had made a few too many enemies and our

fortunes turned ill so it was through

the good grace of Asmodeus that we were

able to get back on our feet as it were

but contracts signed deals made all of

that and we find ourselves in a

difficult position one which you can

help extricate us from in exchange for

which we can come to an amicable

negotiation where we all stand to

benefit before I get a feather let me

tell you what it is that we're after and

he gestures you over toward the window

whereupon you can look out over the sort

of gardens and see playing and running

amidst the maze work of bushes and

butterflies our two young children maybe

eight nine years old a girl and a boy

brother and sister you've met them

before they dropped by the Waffle House

to buy some pastries with their nanny in

fact you can see their tiefling nanny

standing off at a court or sari sitting

on a stone carved bench in a corner of

the gardens knitting but watching them

closely like a hawk you can still see

she's got needles in her hair and she's

wearing a kimono a different colored

kimono than the one you saw her in last

but she is watching them very mindfully

oh you want us to help you find the true

meaning of family I got you

it's very important and she says we've

watched you closely or received reports

frequent reports from our spies

but we don't need help in that regard

but we do need help with our family we

the contract that we made could spell

doom for those two children but there is

a section of the contract a buyout

clause if we can secure enough funds we

can buy ourselves out of the contract

and free our children from a terrible

fate for that we need the gold that Lord

never ember has sequestered away that we

recently have come to learn about yes

you see we can put up a tremendous

amount ourselves we run a successful

banking business in a number of other

mercantile endeavors but we only achieve

half of what we need to secure our

children's future and the future of our

family we need to obtain more gold and

we believe that you are the ones to find

it in fact Asmodeus has told us that you

will be instrumental in securing it

moreover he has said confided in me that

as important as we are as a family to

him you are more important to him than

us well that's great

I'm princes checked out I'd like to die

but that's okay I think I died

yes told us in no uncertain terms that

we are to make amends and reach some

sort of accord a mutually beneficial one

and so here we are before I proceed any

further I should show you what will

befall our children should we not come

to some agreement if you'll follow me

yeah just uh so you said you only have

half the gold so do you get to like keep

one

amalia says lady a sec has lender says

that thought has not crossed our mind

until now hmm and I don't think we would

give it can serious consideration to

Renzi O&L zarina are both worth saving

oh I I absolutely just you know weigh

all options before we take a leave of

this room allow me to present to you

captain Cocker oka and the man stands up

in the chair and DF you've heard the

name there is a captain raka Roka on the

city watch he is a kind of a young

ambitious up-and-coming

figure in the city watch seen as

potential future commander material and

so he's pretty highfalutin when you look

at him he's he's probably about ten

years older than you look

and he's dressed in his city watch

attire and he is also a member of our

inner circle

well like tries to introduce himself

like attempts he's just like pleasure to

meet you captain karo Cucamonga parka

Roca hmm Cucaracha I think that's what

it means what you think it means

Chris well the the city watch badge that

I had obtained from mmm-hmm

yeah lira sir burhan and all that so I

just I'm still like almost a secret city

watch persons I'm not like well known

within Nick their organization or

anything car wrecks yeah okay great

oh all right

and Victoria turns you and says if you

like he can join us to make sure you

know everything stays on the up-and-up

or I can ask him to remain here well you

can come and he will so your led through

the house as you make your way from room

to room to the stairs and you get to the

bottom of the stairs but halfway up this

curling staircase you see a big giant

portrait of the castle enter family that

consists of Lord and Lady Castle and her

much as they stand before you now two

young children much like you the ones

you just saw outside playing and a third

child older teenager perhaps a young man

seems that blend the features of his

father and his mother quite nicely quite

handsomely standing among them a member

of the family you haven't yet met and as

you are waltzed up the stairs you get

this sort of sense of impending dread

that you are about to meet this fifth

member of the castle and her family and

evil in your divine sense starts to go

crazy with every step you take climbing

higher and higher and higher up into

this house it has it been set off at all

by the castle enters we've met I've been

meaning to ask no so they haven't seemed

like super evil to her not in some sort

of fiendish super meta way now okay yeah

so she every step she's like guys I'm

not feeling so super good about this

plan things feel pretty pretty evil up

there I know evil is kind of a no-no

word right now but just like pretty darn

evil oh so now we're not sure though

Castle hunters to sort of stop and turn

and amalia lady castle enter we'll say

you're not wrong there is great evil in

this house and we have it locked in the

Attic and you're gonna come you're

taking us to see the great evil yes now

so that you can understand exactly what

will happen to our

the two children if we do not get out of

this contract but what if we didn't I

just need to give a little disclaimer

that as a humble servant of our Lord of

Light levander it is very tempting for

me when I see a great evil to dispatch

it and if we are to see a great evil

that I am not supposed to dispatch then

we need to discuss this preemptively

right you will quickly realize that this

particular evil great though it may be

has been contained a great a great

expense I might add as long as it's not

like some kind of possessed evil kid or

something then you know I think we'll be

happy it couldn't be that ugly ruff that

would ruin my Tuesday and they will

carry on with the captain following when

you get up to the Attic you even as the

doors opening you start to hear rattling

chains and in the dark sepulcro vastness

of this villas great attic you see a

mound and almost at first looks like a

almost like a big giant thick web like a

cocoon in the middle of the Attic but

then you realize it's all just chains

and that the chains begin to unwind and

curl and take on a life of their own

clattering and rattling as they do and

lady Cassell enter will go over to the

side and light a lantern so that there's

a bit of light to cast upon this figure

and as it shines upon the creature you

see something just

hideous and vile and not to be found in

the natural world

it looks like a vaguely humanoid

creature completely wrapped up in spiky

chains except you can see thick veiny

arms legs dark sort of charcoal colored

skin through a couple gaps in the chains

and see that its eyes are glowing red

it's ma is just that is full of all of

these black teeth and it seems to have

the power to contort and shape the

chains that aren't that bind it to a

limited extent but it is actually sort

of being lashed by its own chains to the

rafters and beams of this attic in such

a pose that it can't really move much at

all but as soon as that light shines

upon them and the castle enters get in

you know move a little bit closer to it

it goes crazy and starts to tear itself

like Watsa tear itself free but can't

you can see on the floor around it

inscribed into the wood are all of these

infernal ruins arrayed and kind of like

a spiral or a circle and they flare with

orange power at each time the creature

tries to break free cool this is our Sun

Osvaldo says Lord Castle enter he was of

age to be taken immediately when the

contract was signed taken to the nine

hells and turned into the chitin you see

before you why that was the deal we

struck why why would you strike a deal

like that with your children because it

would have destroyed our family and our

reputation surprised

well imagine being in our position then

what we were the insurmountable

obstacles we were facing for our

survival

what possible obstacle could make you

agree to let your children be

punished this way is there anywhere I

can throw up oh yeah there's lots of

places okay I'm gonna go throw up a nun

and a dead potted plant let me know if

you find any place in hindsight it was

too great a sacrifice we realized too

late of course too late to save osvaldo

but not too late to save Terenzi O&L

Zarina

if we don't fulfill the terms of the

contract this is what they will become

you would make such a contract and deal

with Asmodeus himself and yeah you know

because we made a contract - or I did

right still great guy of course we're

not saying anything very generous but

just Jesus grace what what is happening

no but there's probably a million things

on a contract that we didn't know about

so bye kit I was correct you're seeking

Lord never never Amber's gold

he'll pay off your debt because Asmodeus

needs money no you see the currency of

the nine hells our souls osvaldo soul

was taken and this is what was left then

what's he need the money for though you

need to buy back his the money is to

someone to a being as mighty and gameis

and generous with his time and his

attention as Asmodeus the money is not

the thing it's the deal we're gonna need

to know more details about this contract

and this ruination you face and why you

made it and what it exactly says because

we're not just gonna go on some errand

to get some money to buy back a soul for

people that made a deal to sacrifice

their own children for their reputation

even's like disgusted by this she says

he see lady calendar says it's not

simply the reputation I don't know how

much you're aware of this but we're it

not for houses such as ours and the

business and the money that we bring

into the city Waterdeep would be nothing

but a muddy cesspool no better than

Luskin or any of these other

inconsequential Berg's it is the

nobility that sustains this city this

makes even look even more disgusted like

it's the nobility that just say

important even spaces just like oh like

what to say it even she's right on that

one right about what that you should

sacrifice children so that the new

beauty you can keep the city afloat no

it's nobility that and their money that

makes water do for what it is water deep

is anything if children are sacrificed

like this oops sacrificing children sore

spot if we help if we help can do we

still have the ability to to do

everything else but we I feel like we

owe a lot of things to a lot of people

right now you might have a weighty a

wait list you see the lord and lady

castle and her sort of class pants we I

mean we we have to help them it's their

son their son roaring behind them

screaming in infernal all kinds of

epithets and I'm understanding those yes

whatever it is it's probably awful yes

what's he saying Strix yes

that's not please yeah I don't want to

repeat he was recounting in grisly

detail all the things he's going to do

to his parents and

house and the city and everybody once he

breaks free of these magical wards I

just it's not great not great a lot of

revenge yes I I have a question mmm-hmm

you've whatever deal you've made with

Asmodeus put your own child into

whatever this state of being is now and

threatens the lives of your two other

children and you want us to help you

rectify that what could you possibly

offer us in return that would even

equate to the sheer weight of of your

sins well that's why we're all here is

to discuss that very thing what is it

that we can give to you that you would

consider to be recompense for the time

and effort that you must undertake to

see the gold safely delivered into our

care well first of all it's probably a

given that if this all goes according to

plan you guys get better with your

parenting because that is that is not

good family practice you know you should

take some parenting courses first

absolutely you need to you need to not

just you know play around with their

lives like that that's that's not yours

to mess around with and speaking of

which I will be right back and I'm gonna

look for Simon falton disappears even

quotes a scripture something like it is

said that though one may be great evil

great good can come from the will of

Lysander and it sounds like you have

been dedicated to the orphanage program

here in Waterdeep and although you have

done there I say a terrible job of

caring for

your own children money can go a long

way in helping the servants of Lysander

care for many other children so I hate

to put such value on money but if money

is what you have then I feel like

funding the orphanage program into

perpetuity as a tenant of your of your

house may be something appropriate here

she she says yes yes that's that is a

very good point perhaps - we can do

something to help your temple I mean I

think that sounds great

but I feel like responding in kind is

making sure that more children don't

suffer at the hands of poor caretakers

well what do you have in mind for the

temple

she says she looks at her husband and

says it's been a while since we visited

there but I understand that they've been

doing some renovations perhaps we can

help them find skilled artisans perhaps

we can provide secure banking services

for their funds well if you go there uh

I

I normally would recommend all there you

know they've got these small groups for

parents you know like you know Sunday

schools and stuff I would totally

recommend you go to that but things have

been a little the theology has been a

little shifted lately and I'm just not

super sure exactly the doctrine that

they're teaching right now so I would

say just go make sure that you talked to

dang it I forgot the new radiance lady's

name your favorite name no I why can't

it happen to last in ad Aragon be sure

to talk to last and Aragon she could

definitely hell

you make amends and also learn the will

of offender maybe you could become

servants of Lysander instead of Asmodeus

and you could learn the the wonder that

it is to stand in his great light

doesn't that sound amazing

what else did you have in mind she says

we're very well connected with various

guilds in the city if you are ever

having issues with one of the guilds we

can help smooth that over if there were

say a somewhat secretly nefarious

incorporation run by someone that I

don't like would it be possible to get

that whole thing completely dismantled

oh yes that won't be difficult at all

[Laughter]

can I find Simon before negotiation yeah

yeah just roll roll a d20 for me okay

that's 12 okay you find yourself in as

you're as you're stumbling around the

house looking for Simon are you calling

out his name or just kind of quietly

moving about the house so I mad okay

amen all right come on C Mon say Moni

you you you come you run down some

stairs into an elegant ballroom that

contains a polished marble floor with a

dazzling mosaic that depicts a silver

chalice with the image of a golden Sun

on its outside and you see gilded

mirrors and handsome tapestries for

stuning the walls along one wall you

also see windows with crimson drapes

stretching from floor to ceiling and

standing in the middle of the room is an

eerie human-sized wood and cloth manikin

where the painted face dressed like a

ballroom dancer well don't want anything

to do with that sigh man okay yes you

you continue to bulge your way through

you can see

you enter a smoking room there's a there

is a guard in house castle enter livery

standing there

he doesn't address you in any way shape

or form or make eye contact with you

except you unless you go over and poke

him

you can see regal portraits adorning the

walls you can also see some of these

portraits rest on fancy easels in

various corners and other spots fine

armchairs the scent of pipe weed hanging

in the air the portraits well I'm like

exploring looking for Simon I'm also

taking notes for like home renovations

like Simon oh yes yes so I met there we

go

all right he hasn't responded to you in

like the first 10 minutes of searching

the house you do occasionally come

across other guards stationed in other

spots in the house they to do not

address you as you're running around

looking for him frantically still

nothing not yet but I roll another d20

well I was gonna say can I cast locate

creature you sure Ken all right I'm

gonna do that that'd be much easier

yelling all right that spell leads you

down to the ground floor into what

appears to be a private library the

scent of old parchment hangs thick in

the air the walls are lined with tall

shelves packed with colorful

leather-bound books each bookshelf is

outfitted with a ladder on a rolling

track you can see shells that take up an

entire wall that don't hold books but

seemed to hold dozens of wide necked

glass bottles filled with swirling mist

and sealed with corks hanging on a wall

between two bookshelves you also see a

seven-foot salt portrait of Lord and

Lady Castle enter holding two infant

children and standing beside their young

son who you just met upstairs I see I

look at the portrait I see against it's

like they're screwed and you notice

immediately actually make a makeup

perception check

before I actually look around I and turn

the first thing that catches my eye is

that sliding ladder yes I just like

slides see how far down the shelves I

can go oh you can go like all the way

around one whole side of the room

practically just it's also like one arm

out yes like I'm just like I finally get

to be a princess nice nice and then I

will do whatever it is yep and so it was

a perception yes okay okay that's an app

20 nice yours guided by your spell you

are led to the portrait of Lord and Lady

Castle enter and realized that it can be

opened on one side that it appears to

actually be a secret door okay that's

where your spell is leading you well

then I'm gonna open that portrait okay

yes as you as it swings open on hidden

hinges you can see a chamber beyond with

a spiral staircase dominating it leading

down and so you are farther into this

house I go I'm just like okay alright

yep seems about right yeah yeah so this

spiral staircase scene would definitely

seem to now go underground

hmmm the stonework changes and becomes

these sort of mortared stones as you

descend deeply into this dank pit as I'm

going down the stairs I'm just like

muttering to myself complaining like

secret portrait door I mean you know

Ravenloft had an organ but no portraits

cool I guess

[Laughter]

what are the rest of you doing while

paltin is descending into the bowels of

the earth I believe were still in the

middle of negotiations yes and I think

that like we probably recognized that

paltin might want to have a say in this

so I believe this becomes probably like

a brainstorming session like oh and

maybe you could help us with this and Oh

what about that and like we just start

like popcorn throwing ideas at some of

all the possible things yeah Strix is

like dear how do you feel about our can

alot son what your what you quickly

discover in interacting with Lord and

Lady Castle enter is they had they put

whether they're putting on airs so they

actually believed it to be true they

none of nothing that you say seems to be

beyond their grasp they they immediately

believe that it's something that they

can deal with fairly quickly they are

they they claim to have great

connections throughout the city the

watch captain who's standing next to you

doesn't discount anything that they're

saying they tell you that they know

people who know people they know people

who they know how to basically get

whatever they want from anybody they

want in the city can i insight check

them for that you sure can I would like

to see oh that's not bad that's not

that's an 18 okay you've kind of seen or

heard this behavior described before it

there's there's definitely narcissism at

play here but it's more than that you

think that they probably are extremely

well connected and if they are Asmodeus

worshipers they probably have something

on a lot of people in the city and can

basically call in favors based on that

all right or you would not be surprised

if there's like a fairly large

contingent of Asmodeus worshipping

people in the city and they're part of

it you you get the sense that they're

connected to something okay could I know

this is a bad idea I was thinking that

could I just sort of try and play my

hand as like I've met Asmodeus and like

try and convince them liked it but

- not like mess with us sure how would

you like to do that probably really

poorly like yeah he's my dad they they

will look at you with with some

skepticism I'm just like looking at like

evil and Victoria will say what prompted

you to bring that up I just I just don't

want you to kill us we can't not even if

we wanted to and I told you before I've

spoken to Asmodeus in prayer and he has

gotten one of the rare occasions when

he's spoken back and says no harm shall

befall you you are very important to him

I mean I don't know if that's worse or

better but alright he's not my dad but I

just feel like so technically you guys

are kind of supposed to protect us from

any and all threats then huh they look

at each other and they say I believe

that was part of Asmodeus wish I mean

I'm not here to threaten you and they're

not going to do anything that would go

against the wishes of Asmodeus I bet

they're good at locating people Diaz

weren't you looking for someone we

certainly wouldn't he brought you up

here if we don't trust you completely

someone with a coin with the mouse on it

no think so there was something about

like a coin I'm sure I can help you find

anyone that we might need to kill

there's still that right now we can flip

back defaulting yeah all so long he's

like hope I'm not missing anything

important yeah paltin you come to the

stairs come to a room they descend down

into the middle of a room that stretches

off in both directions when you come

down the bottom the stairs there's like

a hallway behind you there's a hallway

ahead of you with doors that look like

cell doors iron with little barred

windows set into them that way where the

doors are seems to be a dead end just

like a little cell block but the way

behind you you can hear what sounds like

chanting oh good is the is the chanting

childlike and singular no it is adult

voices speaking a language you probably

don't know some sort of Prayer or spoken

him sorta and they sat they sound like

multiples yes see Simon in the ten

minutes I don't watch him joined a cult

okay that's some good parenting right

there it's like alright add that to the

list of bannings all right can I like

try and peek in and see if he's be here

well it's even though you can hear the

chanting it sounds like it's a fair

distance away but as you head in that

direction

you can see that you follow the hallway

it bends it sort of bends again and then

it sort of scrunches down and narrows

and the the torch sconce is on the walls

do have torches burning in them although

they're kind of burning down now they're

kind of sputtering and worn out the

torch holders look like clawed hands

sticking out of the walls and will you

to what appears to be a stone balcony on

one side of a large temple complex an

underground temple with great pillars

supporting its cathedral like sealing

the hole Affairs underground so it's

this giant vaulted chamber and you're on

this upper balcony about 15 feet across

from this balcony is the opposite

balcony on the other side of the

cathedral there is nothing connecting

these two balconies to one another but

they appear to have exits leading off of

them so if you wanted to get to that

other balcony you'd have to somehow

cross this open expanse of about a

15-foot gap but below you is where the

sounds are coming from and as you peer

down into the Cathedral toward one end

you see some red robed worshippers

gathered around the foot of a very large

statue that you can only see part of but

it seems to have a fiendish countenance

oh this is a weird party do I see Simon

yet please please don't maybe he's

already leading the cult and you peer

down and yes you can see that that Simon

is standing amid them one of the robed

figures kind of has a hand resting on

Simon's shoulder and Simon's just sort

of standing there with you no you can't

see you're kind of lonely looking at the

back of him but he's he's sort of either

been led into or swept into this thing

isn't this happening that's happening

you can see that the figures wear masks

over their faces this sort of weird

creepy fete that they're engaged in and

they're passing around a goblet which

you hope contain

wine but you're not sure no no and there

are there are eight of these robed

individuals I need you to make a

perception check okay it's like yep left

them alone for 10 minutes join a cult

that is a 17 okay you can hear something

coming from the direction you came

basically following you in a way that

seems to be wearing its armored whatever

it is heavy footfalls Clank Clank Clank

Clank up and goes away toward you

[Music]

alright okay okay

a figure comes out on to the same stone

balcony that you're on this creature

although it looks humanoid has kind of

purplish skin it stands about six foot

five and has fiendish features the most

grisly thing aside from the kind of

infernal armor that it wears is

sprouting from its face and chin is a

beard of snakes and it brandishes a

halberd that seems to just drip blood

and it comes out onto the balcony and

just looks around like it's expecting to

find trouble just invisibly like a sea

like maybe a way down or was it just

balcony

so it basically balcony dropped but

there are pillars underneath the balcony

to hold it up so you could basically

drop come over the railing of a balcony

and then kind of scale down one of the

pillars there would be some kind of

check huh yeah as you consider doing

that this creature not seeing anything

just sort of stops and then kind of just

starts waving his weapon around yeah I'd

like to duck there very slowly

deliberately as you duck and make your

way over to the edge of the balcony just

make a stealth check to see if you can

conceal your sounds as well as your

sight okay

you have it I'll give you advantage cool

because there's chanting and other noise

about okay definitely needed that

advantage okay that's okay

that's a 21 you're able to skirt around

this devilish creature get to the edge

of the balcony with it not being aware

of your present location and currently

it's sort of off in another part of the

balcony just sort of moving its blade

around slowly like the first blade like

got this clumsy I guess I'll try and

climb my way down then okay

make an athletics check legs athletics

oh I was hoping did a probiotics down

like a fancy man oh wait fifteen okay

that's good enough yes yes so you are

now down on the main floor of the

Cathedral about thirty feet behind the

the convocation who have gathered around

what appears to be a fiendish statue if

it's of Asmodeus it's sort of a ghastly

evil representation of him more

monstrous than human okay and they're

there to entranced with their wine

drinking and chanting to see in the dark

recesses of the cathedral behind them

the lone figure hiding behind a pillar

hmm that is also invisible yes there is

also a near the foot of the as Midea

statue a golden brazier quite large and

round almost looks like a big oversized

goblet coming up off the floor there

doesn't you don't know you know there's

nothing in it that you can see okay

well oh and from your vantage point you

can see in one corner of the Cathedral

an open door almost like a little

antechamber a closet door that's been

pulled open and beyond you see shelves

and shelves of wine of course goddamn it

[Laughter]

alum is Simon wine is Simon wine

Simon why all the seasonal eyes this Oh

goddamnit Bergin's okay it's all right

we have a big hoard at home that's noted

we're safe here so I need to feed

I'm I need I want to try is Simon's like

what doesn't matter if it's back to his

back is to me because he can't see me

right I don't have a way how many are

there there are eight oh eight of these

cultists interesting okay I want to try

and sneak up and tap Simon on the

shoulder like like below thus the sounds

of the chanting just like whisper you

like Simon let's go oh okay

yeah I'm not gonna have any make a

stealth check because the chanting is

pretty loud and you can easily slip and

wind your way up to him to tap him on

the shoulder let me just check something

very quickly here and you've probably

heard Tris tricks cursing enough and

infernal to know that that's what

they're actually chanting in mmm

probably while she's baking you're not

chanting fair fair yes you can see that

the figure who's got its hand on Simon's

shoulder is a female tiefling you

haven't seen her before

and she's also wearing the mask in the

red robed regalia of the cult so when

you tap Simon on the shoulder he doesn't

jerk or exhibit any tremendous amount of

surprise and you say we got to get out

of here or something like that

mm-hmm come on Stan be go dad is that

you

Shh uh sorry I can't leave right now I'm

joining a cult and the tiefling woman

says who are you talking to my dear oh

it's my dad he's standing invisible

right behind me

I just I break invisibility I'm just

like hi lovely aesthetic everybody just

stops chanting there's like a wine

goblet that's been passed around one guy

just sort of holds it and sorry didn't

mean to interrupt

drop my son off at you know his way down

but um I just wanted to you know collect

him you know praise be to Asmodeus and

home the teeth filling woman says the

boy found his way down here and is one

of us now

that's and I you know what I'm so happy

for him I never wanted to like sway

whatever he tries to like identify with

and things like that um and you know

whatever he wants to believe that's

great you know totally progressive he

just can't stay here okay make a

persuasion check a very very important

one yes absolutely

23 okay

she will kneel down to simon's level and

say my dear did you want to go with him

or did you want to stay with me and he

turns to her and he looks back at you

and he turns back at her turn back turn

back and he has to make a saving throw

how dare he breaks the charm good boy

let's hear tears free of her grip and

says and and it says y'all not very nice

did I you cast a spell on me

well that answers that I look out there

I'm just like you did it what to my son

now the chief lien was like it's just a

little charm spell saying hmm well it

would be much more unfortunate if we

were you know guests in this house and

were you know requested by Asmodeus

because otherwise he'd probably be

hearing about this

wouldn't that be unfortunate they they

instinctively sort of turned their heads

toward the statue and you see the

statues brow actually change and they

throw themselves down upon the floor

mm-hmm

the wine chalice clatters across the

floor and rolls over to you see it's a

beautiful gold chalice waste of wine one

of the mightiest of cinema and they

begin to tremble and quiver on the floor

now

just don't let it happen again this this

whole thing has taken too many children

you don't need any more okay you just

stay down here you sing your nice little

song and I'm gonna go back up where the

grown-ups are negotiating okay all right

and you you sort of take Simon and walk

him away leaving them trembling on the

floor at which point the snake a snake

bearded devil leaps down off the balcony

and

you roll initiative excuse me the cult

is better and defend you at this point

I'm just saying okay okay okay all right

all right fine let's roll and that would

be a 17 okay you won the initiative what

would you like to do I turned back to

the cult I'm just like my loyal

followers suggestion big snake

trying to kill me in there listening all

right

so every one of them except the tiefling

woman succumbs to your spell pulls out a

dagger and charges the snake bearded

fiend and she's like no no no I turned

her it's like wait is like is he bad it

wants to fight me why does he want to

should not like who's that yeah and so

they come at him I'm gonna have them act

right away okay they they will make

attacks with their daggers against him

and actually several them are able to

hit him but you realize that they're

their daggers while they are drawing

blood from his devilish flesh don't seem

to be penetrating that flesh very deeply

like he seems super naturally resistant

to their non magical weapons and as soon

as he's accosted he starts to retaliate

in kind and with a swing of his glaive

decapitates one of the cultists

through the greater evil yep and then

comes out the other one with his nest of

sneaky beard stuff and those snakes

start to bite into the flesh of a second

cultist oh that's kind of cool though

yep what do you do on your next turn

now that you've charged the cultists

against this devil guard I'm going to

turn to the teeth and be like so who is

that and there's like death screams it

it's one of the temple defenders oh okay

I'm gonna if I can I'm gonna tell the

cultists to stand down okay I'm gonna

ask the defender be like I'm sorry I

thought you were someone else I wish no

more harm on you okay please the rest of

you upstairs the castle enters are kind

of tired of their chiton son screaming

at them so they take you to a quieter

place in the house yeah yeah that's nice

I appreciate that yeah I still had

questions that I wanted to ask and you

can see they're they're profoundly

disturbed by that encounter there

they're both shaken how I'm glad there's

at least sense of guilt in them

somewhere so before I feel like before

we even tried to discuss or even

solidify or agree upon what we they

could possibly do for us there's still a

lot more details about what they want

from us that we should probably figure

out she Victoria says I'm glad you asked

so we have heard through our contacts

that in order to find where the gold is

kept we need a device called the stone

of goal or it is a magic item I'm sure

you're acquainted with it we know that

this item is currently in the hands of a

noblewoman named Ezra lay Raja who has

gone into hiding however we believe that

she is going she is planning

a proxy to auction off the stone in a

matter of days hmm and we will secure an

invitation to said auction

we will also ensure that you receive an

invitation to the auction as well if she

doesn't send one to you oh she will she

loves dia our first order of business

that's good to know thank you a first

order of business is to get the stone

which will reveal to us where the gold

is kept that auction is the key if you

will join us at that event we will

consider that first step toward this new

alliance and so should we arrive at this

auction are you planning on winning the

auction yourselves to obtain the stone

with your money by any means necessary

right you know by the rules of the

auction

exactly good then why'd you hand the

stone off to us so that we can try to

use this to discover where Lord never

embers gold is yes and then help us

secure it we are aware that there are

other factions in the city you have come

into contact with them in our spies

haven't detected as much who will try to

intercede your familiarity with them all

ensure that they don't get the gold

before we do this gold that we keep

talking about getting are we talking

about stealing I just want to be real

clear

your silence makes me think that I am he

says the gold was embezzled to begin

with no doubt Lord never embryo was

corrupt if we get the gold it will be

put toward a noble purpose probably a

better purpose than any other what do

you think about this whole probably was

embezzled thank you I have no doubt that

the money was embezzled or tire to or

obtained through many illegal means what

if we trade him something for the money

like a transaction instead of a stealing

what like but what would be value enough

to him that you would give up a pile of

money

no no money's not that valuable to me he

says the terms of our contract are clear

we need the payment the money the gold

that's what they're seeking and with

that they they can try to solve

according to them all of our problems

ever

I mean Diaz if you're okay with stealing

then I know it must be right but I just

think this sounds a lot like stealing to

me so I wouldn't want you to do the one

thing that you can't do morally and you

don't have to jump to any conclusions

now the auctions not for what we won't

know exactly when the art when and where

the auction will take place for another

day or two until then you can ruminate

on the matter right where was this

auction be located yet to be determined

okay I guess we'll wait for the

invitation for that then we have to tell

Paul to not to throw it away yeah in

this invitation will be sent to our

manor yes great and then you're aware

that our other fashions are after the

stones galore so if we go to this

auction those other fashions will be

present and they will be an obstruction

how do you plan on dealing about dealing

with that he puts a hand on your

shoulder captain Woodrow I'm sure you'll

come up a plan

and we will support you 100% and then

how do they know you're not wearing the

Hat infeasible implies towel that's

right yeah and so lady calendar says and

now we come to the conclusion of this

negotiation and she goes over to a table

and rings a little bell and then the

tiefling manservant to the condescending

one returns and she says fetch zodia and

he leaves and she says should our

negotiations fall apart and we don't

come to terms we will have no choice but

to acquire the gold any way we can and

regard you as obstacles to that end but

you can't kill us you'd lose all your

favor with the house potatoes no you're

right we can't kill you

and he comes back with a box this

tiefling manservant and walks over and

throws drops it at your feet strikes me

yes

uh-huh and you see the box has some

straw sticking out of it and there is

something nested in the middle of the

box and it is the decapitated head of

the old tiefling banker whose security

you thwarted well she was really mean

why why why are you putting this in

front of me well she did have one good

virtue and she showed us that our

security precautions were not quite up

to snuff I mean you could have just told

her

bad job and maybe like dr. pay but I've

shown another but there are the people

in the city who have crossed paths with

you I'm sure there are she won't be the

last

I don't appreciate threats and I'm sure

that days probably doesn't either right

that's right

I'm sorry TV lady cutting away you've

left the kids in the care

fala lefel ear she sewn at squidly Jenks

as your as your isn't waffles with them

too

kind of lamenting this confinement you

realize fella has been called away so

of the nice things in the house maybe

maybe he saw an adventure in Jenks is

mine Ferdinand being the stuff tell Vera

your choice in the case of NAT or

completely neglecting your tourism

around and engaging in play you here in

the sort of

so troll skull alley is a gets a fair

amount of traffic during the day it's

kind of a busy bustling place but you

hear the rising does it sounds of some

sort of musical instrument that you have

never heard before and it's really quite

alluring oh no are we getting Pied Piper

I love it yeah I go right towards a

magic sounds fun yeah that's like what

what we look very enthralled yeah so you

go out you go out the front door and

into the street you follow this sound

and you see something spectacular you

see a sort of a young call slender man

turning the crank on a box that sort of

perched on a post the box is very

decorative and colorful and music is

coming out of it it is a hurdy gurdy

hurdy gurdy writing this thing and on

top of the hurdy-gurdy you see a dancing

monkey

I don't like monkeys squidly immediately

goes up and tries to just be like cool I

want to try any like attempts to just

start like cranking the thing oh yeah

this young musician and he says ha ha

okay yeah the monkey the monkey will

dance with Ferdinand absolutely dance

and that you're kind of watching this

just by herself she followed them to be

like what are you doing why are you

running in the street do your chores but

then as soon as she saw this and she

sees squidly cranking and jinks dancing

she goes and like puts her hand on the

hurdy-gurdy to feel the vibrations of it

and kind of like scratches the monkey a

little bit and she has just kind of a

childlike wonder as well well the three
