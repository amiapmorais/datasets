hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action at the indie game of super action

and adventure featuring an all-star cast

which this week includes Brooks Donahue

thank you for joining us today

[Music]

all right has anyone asked how is one

person in this dream is Brooks into all

right so previously in dice camera

action a centaur operative named

cisterna Rai came upon the Waffle House

after death received a sending a warning

from his antara member named astride

horn saying that as an as an authority

quiz eminent cisterna I was able to

charm a tiefling Archon named tulip who

was involved in this attack and then

took her inside the waffle house shortly

thereafter after after locking the kids

down in the basement where they would be

safe it was soon became apparent that

was not not the way to go because the

threat actually came up from below

disintegrating their way into the cellar

several or two undead beholders that

proceeded to disintegrate their way

further into the tap room of the Waffle

House and they're a melee ensued and

rays were fired and B whole undead

beholders were killed

d/f actually got the kids upstairs I

believe they're in hiding in Strix his

bedroom now evil wins evil ends bedroom

now yes on the third floor and on

Twitter mentioned that even probably has

one of those really obnoxious well

hangings with she would have gotten

Aurora's whole realms catalog are you

ordered it out of the catalog and so yes

they're upstairs DF was able to get evil

ins flaming sword and throw it to her

during the battle so that she could be

armed with something other than a broken

bottle yes so there is a brief moment of

reprieve after the second beholder is

killed there is smoke coming up off of

the floor because a fireball was

detonated in the cellar underneath and

there are the cracks in the floorboards

is just billowing out toxic smoke right

now I would like to say sorry and you

smell burnt hair of what were at one

point several bug bears down there that

got incinerated by the fireball what do

you do after tulip says so you don't

want me to call them off then okay I

mean I'm just looking shocked because

that this just happened so many times

we're just so bad at communicating DF

just had that look of just guiltily like

if the rest of the party

death will ask uh if she knew about it

how many were down there

who's left I already asked you how many

she says

24:00 bugbears some goblins and and

they'll be holders I'll go to the hash

arch of the first wave Oh what wrote the

what hey I mean it's no big deal but

yeah if you could like call him off now

that'd be great thanks for offering

please do call them off if you have the

ability all right she will look down in

through the smoke and the disintegrated

hatch down the rock the rock and earth

stairs that lead down into the cellar

and through the smoke and I can't

remember if the darkness is still up nor

I I don't I don't think I've taken

damage yet yeah so it's still up so she

just calls down to the darkness and says

if anything they're still alive down

there don't come up

it's all fine him now and then you all

hear what sounds like pipe music like

flute music from somewhere deep down

below and then she turns to you and she

says no it sounds kind of haunting and

sinister and then she turns to you and

says oh that's scary with her pipes yeah

she's gonna come up with a bunch of rats

and other stuff now good luck with that

I'm gonna be over here under the stairs

she hides underneath the spiral

staircase

thanks for the luck that's nice and then

you smell this terrible odor like burnt

garbage and coming up the stairs into

the room is a smoking half flaming

garbage monster which some of you have

seen before it's just this shambling

mass of refuse there's a trash

elementals

I thought we killed that we didn't solve

that problem I was working on it

paltin when you see the garbage monster

lumber up into the tap room what do you

do it's your turn oh good okay well so

is this thing like right up in my right

up in my grill now it's yeah and boy

does it smell okay it's like the sewer

coming to visit you neat I'm gonna go

ahead I'm gonna distance myself okay not

the best memories of this thing okay

[Laughter]

yeah okay if I may yes

and who's who's nearby me who it kind of

everybody is around you at this point so

I just kind of look around like who's

gonna hit this thing anyone yeah okay

cool

then I will I will uh Bartok inspiration

for Evelyn okay like how do you do it so

you'll get a d-10 evylyn as he strums

his what's the song like um it's kind of

rushed so it's just kind of a bunch of

notes at once I only heard you say it's

kind of rush yeah just like just like

bagpipes speed metal nice okay and while

you're doing that you can hear some

thunder outside as the rain continues to

pour in in the dark night but you're

like am they like accompanies it right

yes yeah like right right on the drop

uh-huh big crash of thunder head bangs

on that moment to just Wow cool alright

and awry what do you do is the as rush

starts playing ok so so if trash

Mountain a seven feet tall now

like right now correct it just came up

out of the darkness and you don't see it

doesn't seem to have eyes or any real

Anatomy so you're not surprised it was

able to make its way up through the dark

tight alright okay I think I know what

I'm going to do if you don't know if

it's pretty close to me I'll take I'll

take a moment to just look at D after

Paul tender or stretcher whoever's close

and not engaged and just say we need to

start considering not staying here oh no

that's not happening

oh I've been considering and oh yeah

without without another word of that I'm

going to move to this thing and attack

it two unarmed strikes okay yeah you

start punching away at the garbage pile

hey however plus eight so I have that

twelve and fourteen both of those sort

of punch into the garbage ineffectually

but you hit nothing of consequence that

would consider to be harming it how do I

hurt this thing yep so you just sort of

pull out your now stinky garbage the

slime covered fists and hands it's just

like oh yeah by the way don't get near

it it would have gone through the

Moonbeam so you can do some damage yep

you can also have your special chickens

it's out I'm here too so give me the

give me the damages and it gets a saving

throw against the Moonbeam which it

actually failed third level okay that's

right so that's twelve spectral chicken

damage okay and that's gonna be

seventeen moon be damaged Wow more burnt

garbage

all right I have a quick question if I

still if gotten awry is still trying

think you're garbage hands so after

hearing paltin after I immediately punch

in palms like yet don't do that

I will use my bonus action to disengage

and the remain to back off a little bit

okay you do you pull away from this

thing and yeah before it can take any

action right now it's just baking in the

Moonbeam and getting pecked to death by

a spectral chicken hot garbage my

favorite exactly the floor under Strix

explodes as to me as two greenish warty

hens and arms come smashing up through

the wood timbers and try to grab her by

the ankles

ice ice cream so stress afraid that's a

nineteen tattoo yes of course so you are

grabbed by these long talent super

strong green claws and then they pull

you down through the floor so yes you

absolutely can

[Laughter]

it's okay the property is still in a

prime spot so like the values still

gonna go up we're okay we'll still

Magnus that that's a sixteen or whatever

okay it it does half damage okay it

succeeded so it takes damage it's

someone in the chat perk and stop

ruining troll tide and describe for me

so seventeen half is eight describe for

me what the hellish rebuke actually

looks like normally like does it just

does the fire kind of just explode out

of you does

surround the creature in flame does it I

would think it's more I'm just like a

fire sneeze like a panic like okay so

she sneezes fire on to this creature

yeah okay it's not impressive it's more

panicky yes

and because it's in the area of the

darkness and now you are - you can't see

what it is that you just sneezed on

however I will let you yeah it's magical

darkens but just make an intelligence

check for me you think it's a troll

right basic rule tired

based on what pieces of it you actually

saw the rest of Li not see this coming

oh I have to make another check for

something okay well I'm still screaming

yes so the rest of you just see these

hands come up through the floor pull

strix through the floor into the

darkness below and then there's this

sort of scream and Ellucian of sneeze

and all kinds of nice

I also that mess up my concentration or

my chickens as well or break so didn't

do damage to you but you are getting

pulled down through the floor so I'm

gonna have you make yeah I just have to

do it myself how do you make a

constitution saving through okay okay

yeah you can maintain concentration if

you want okay cool yeah okay and now you

are sort of grappled by it in the

magical darkness drinks help all right

uh-huh a second troll smashes its arms

through the floor and attempts to grab

evylyn there's mistake troffer enrolled

a natural 20 grabs her by her little

winged legs and rips her down to another

hole in the floor you got oh I need you

to know how Chris Perkins is a

mastermind of like torture because I

don't know if you guys know this but I

had a recurring

nightmares a kid about being grabbed by

the ankles and dragged evylyn you are

pulled down into the magical darkness

and can't see squat and you are in the

clutches of some big strong creature in

this darkness and then you hear nos cos

voice in the darkness ache and somebody

just spell this darkness and you hear

the pipe their pipe music coming from

somewhere nearby as well okay

evylyn it's your turn you still got your

flaming sword you can't see the fire or

the sword in the darkness can I try to

slice that whatever yes it's me wow it's

grappling you you can still attack so I

only hitting it but it's got it must be

like carrying something else cuz you hit

something hard and you're not sure what

it is

oh no I'm swinging it around but it

looks really freaking cool well no it's

art no I mean my flaming sword you can't

see the flame either why because the

magical darkness it blocked everything

so nobody sees nobody sees your your

badass moves but all of you can hear

Strix and evil and down in the black

dungeon Strix what do you do on your

turn oh I'm glad grapples by this thing

misty step the heck out of there and

where are you attempting to misty step

two up back onto the floor of the tap

room yeah okay okay that you can do no

it has to be a space that you can see

sorry

[Laughter]

okay I'm gonna try to polymorph the

troll then that's a wisdom 16 transforms

a creature you can see you can't see it

[Laughter]

the chickens are still there okay

Oh chickens are okay ah I can polymorph

myself you can't see yourself dark

darkness is killer on spellcasters I

gotta say no one's gonna see it is I'm

gonna polymorph my staff into a pie pan

okay and then I'm going to cast green

flame blade on it go ahead and make an

attack roll with your pie pan okay

flaming the pie pan which must be

blowing up right now fifteen okay that

hits okay damage and then the flame

actually moves to another target and

does to d8 + 4 damage oh thanks yeah so

for the first troll it's 10 and then the

second troll is elect ok 10 jumps a

target yeah so there's a whooshing noise

down below okay now what nobody realizes

is these trolls are carrying big barrels

of smoke powder on their backs

so course they are I would like

everybody to make a dexterity saving fro

please everyone everybody 15 droolin

okay yes okay so I'm not sixteen for me

okay yeah actually twenty actually um I

rolled fifteen okay

so sorry I'm drawing on the map here

here is just scratch off that part of

the house there is a monumental

explosion in the basement the whole

place fills with flame the entire

building shudders a roughly twenty five

foot square section of the floor is

completely blown away into flinders

underneath you and everybody in the tap

room is caught in the blast this is the

second time our cap room has exploded

that's not like this literally your

entire bar is just disintegrated and all

the furnishings use-case get completely

ripped away and blown to smithereens big

how do we get a return on our not ours

we were renting

no angel ways have a field day I swear

we're not getting our deposit everybody

akalitis mine

everybody except okay so Evelyn Halton

DF you each take 17 points of fire

damage is that a failed sense a that's a

successful save then I take no damage

thanks to my supreme evasion all right

Holly Strix has fire resistance because

she's cooling so you take eight points

of fire damage an arai you take 34

points of fire damage and you are blown

out through one of the front windows

which actually doesn't have any glass in

it at the moment

yeah we've been mean to replace that two

and you're just sort of propelled out

onto the front porch right at the foot

of Lance the donkey who just glanced the

mule who just kind of licks you as

you're lying there crooked on the ground

okay and when you look back through the

open window that you just got shot out

of you can see there is just smoke and a

roughly 20 foot square hole in the

middle of the tap room with an open

basement in which you can see your domed

well actually your darkness is probably

gone at this point so that the darkness

sort of disappears and now they've just

got this kind of open basement in the

middle of their tap where hey Brooks

what level monk are you because if he

happens we served hell or high he would

have evasion C would have taken a half

fire damage oh wait that's the thing so

I might not be after I roll stuff on

this I do have a patient okay I wanted

to ask if that's something that would

mitigate the damage on a failed save it

works on both so instead you end up

taking 17 points of damage because

elevation yeah so failed is no dammit or

success is no damage failed is half too

okay right so you took half damage so

I'm just trying to keep our desk player

alive for once they can ask those

questions right at the fourth wall got

it mm-hmm

yeah that's yeah sure sorry that that

was Jared Ruth luring because I'm trying

to get an anything any problem the

garbage monster is still alive in the

room but also took significant amounts

of damage from the no alas it does not

and you can see over in a corner the

sort of smoking unconscious body of the

tiefling arch and just sort of lying

there splayed out on the floor okay

unconscious and body and that's that's

two different things okay

the next round that was all Strix that

sure was wasn't it that was all yes

you can't you come TF you come crawling

out of the fireplace blackened with soot

there's a there's a big gaping hole

right in front of you where you can see

down into the smoldering pit of the

basement it is full of bodies namely

troll blown apart troll parts and all

kinds of dead blackened smoking bugbear

corpses you can also see evil in kind of

lying in like on top of the torso of it

of a troll that is sort of twitching and

you can see these troll arms crawling

their way back towards it from explosion

all right something's kinda like I'm

like gotta crawl dogma covered in just

 and explosions like that alright so

from

I can see can I see evylyn and Strix or

yes alright and do those two seem okay

artistics is holding on to a flaming

frying pan

that's wreathed in green flames yes yeah

and she doesn't look she only looks like

slightly singed alright how much fire is

still like just kind of about oo all

kinds there like part there walls and

floor boards on fire there's a chair

that's on fire

it looks like the Strad chair avoided

the blast the irony of the fact of you

finding yourself in the fireplace and it

being one of the only places that is

known right

and technically death has not been in

fireplaces many times yes the rafters

are on fire so do I see any immediate

threats

you said the shambling mount you can

hear her garbage bomb so from your point

of view actually you can see the hole in

the basement that was basically

disintegrated out to allow the forces to

infiltrate your house and coming from

that tunnel is the sound of pipe music

flute music still playing at 30 feet

away from you

alright this wood that that hole was

never there before right we just

complete okay yeah yeah the beholder has

made it with their disintegration I

raised all right but these troll hands

are crawling towards evil in right now

very very slowly that troll is not going

to be able to knit itself back together

anytime soon okay

still a concern and something I can

quickly take care of at least the other

time either way doesn't look like it's

so badly burnt you don't even think it's

yeah another one is so burnt like it's

not okay yeah but one is trying to okay

so

ideas will cost will he get to his feet

go to one of his belt pouches take out

one of his flasks of oil mm-hmm well

light it on one of nearby flames and

just throw it get the troll arms okay

just to like night doesn't like finish

them office here they're great they burn

up and they twitch their little fingers

and are no longer moving and then it's

looking around to make sure the house is

structural integrity is a still holding

up and maybe like looking for the stairs

or upstairs and listening for the kids

or waffles or Simon yeah you can see

there's a hole where the the spiral

staircase normally sits and you don't

hear anything

coming from it okay

there is another way upstairs but it's

an outside route that's how a there's

that sounds like they're behaving up

there good on them cut two kids upstairs

and Evelyn's bedroom NAT Jenks and

squidly the three of you feel the blast

shake the entire house all of the

furniture in Evelyn Evelyn's room shakes

that thing hanging up on the wall the

lovely' thandor sign shakes and rattles

her mirror shakes and rattles you see

Simon has just returned to the room and

he's got what looks like a little tray

on wheels and he sort of parks it in a

corner facing the door and he screws on

this armature and then pulls it back

with rope and a fixes a hand axe to it

and then and that sort of unstart son

spooling wire and stretching it from

that little makeshift axe throwing

device to the door

home alone situation yeah and it looks

like he had all this stuff kind of

hidden away in various corners of the

house now asked him what are you doing

he he tries to sign using the limited

language you've got suggesting that if

just make an intelligence check to see

if you can interpret his gestures okay

you get the impression that he says it's

homemade defenses in case the monsters

come go down and help and then he gives

you a gesture which you interpreted to

mean that he is protecting you and that

we should stay here and then when you

say that he's just like I role goes back

to just stringing the wire across the

door there's actually a lot of spring in

the bed so at one point he sort of

bounces himself right off and yeah so

Simon's Simon's busy rigging what

appears to be some sort of axe Hucker do

the kids want to do anything else not

will ask or if we should stay squigglies

like oh you think all right we probably

should go that's what you said right all

right let's go

and squealy just like goes for the door

okay and you know there are two doors

into Yvonne's bedroom there's the door

that assignment is currently stringing

the wire across and then there is the

door to the private bath that evylyn has

which also has a door out off of it

leading into the hall so you don't have

to go through that door squiggly but I

know you're gonna go through that door

swiftly wait door is closed er is the

one that Simon is

is rigging with the wire squidly was not

listening guys for that door when you do

Simon just sort of goes hand up on the

door squeal a looks at in like hi-5 says

hand like yeah now I gotta go again okay

just make a d20 roll to open the door

resisting the puppet as it's trying to

keep the door closed

that's a nine okay you're not able to

get the door open I go hi hey over there

no I Pete earlier probably in her den

okay she's imagine she's just like Mara

like a cat just like licking her bits

like waiting for this - yes yeah I'm

always stay here explosion sounds bad

but we're adventurers we can be

adventurers after this place isn't

exploded anymore is there like a window

there are there are two windows one

facing the front one facing the side

alley and there is a fireplace okay cool

i squidly would still not think to use

the other doors that he's gonna try and

like climb out the nearest window okay

yeah so he opens up a window it's a

little stuck because it hasn't been open

in probably years but does he want to

drop down in the front of the house to

the side of the house if he goes out if

he goes out to the side window he'll

land on the roof of the kitchen which is

actually a one-story adjoining building

can can I just grab him by the shirt and

just drag him over I was on hit come on

yeah you can grab him by them you know

he just grabs him by the back of the

tunic it's just like longsuffering and

just pulling it along and then I and

then she looks at jinxed and and she's

like are you scared are you an adventure

oh that dirty lady keeps telling me I

know magic so let's go

oh all right so you head out through the

private baths across the room

Simon doesn't even try to like science

or anything he just like rolls his eyes

yeah kind of never related to Simon

harder yes squidly discovers the back

way guys did you know okay and once

again I'll see you get out of the hall

the three of you can see that there are

stairs going up and down in the hall the

downstairs ones will head down to the

second floor which is closer to the

danger and meanwhile let's see what's

next oh good no bad so DF noski mm comes

out into the basement through that

tunnel stepping over the body parts of

the trolls and the dead bug bears and he

sees evylyn and Strix in the pit and

[Music]

then behind him you see a augur come

lumbering out this ogre is all sort of

undead patchy flesh falling off you can

see bones in various parts of its skull

exposed but it's holding what appears to

be a large fishing pole and hanging on

the end of the pole you Strix evylyn all

see that there is what looks like to be

a paper mache maybe made out of garbage

and other things beholder about five

feet in diameter with my stocks and it's

just holding onto this thing and wading

out into the basement and kind of

swinging it around this beholder has a

big central eye and no mouth that you

can see and I stock sort of glued to the

top of it

and what looked like magical lights cast

on its eyestalks sort of blinking and

just sort of shooting lights in all

directions

happy trial time what is that like a

trial time decoration do we recognize

that it looks like a it looks like a

beholder pinata on the end of a big

giant fishing pole

maybe there's candy in it yeah check if

you want like if this is an authority or

some okay well you can ascertain

that the the glowing eyes is a very

minor magical effect that's easily

produced by thaumaturgy and other minor

cantrip spells and things like that it's

pure razzle dazzle this is clearly

however an inanimate thing but at that

point this creature just sort of stops

and holds this thing in the middle of

the room and it sort of looks or just

sort of swings it around so it can see

everything and then the the paper mache

garbage beholder kind of looks at you

palton come on and that's all that that

that's all that happens at that point

and then Oscar says

where are the rats send in the rats and

it is Paulton wait

send them in Nazca he says to you evil

in we've never met before I don't know

you you probably you sort of pull

yourself up amid some guard out of the

knock some garbage that you are a turd

table that fell on top of you after you

were thrown across the room you can see

that this fake beholder is bobbing

around looking at you weirdly good yeah

okay um so let me see here can I

oops yeah so I'm I'm like I am like

4,000 percent over anything remotely

beholder yeah so what's so what's this

so it's like pretty messed up in here oh

yes cool there's not much there's not

much floor left there's jagged edges of

floor around basically the perimeter of

the tap room there's like a four to five

foot jagged edge to shreds you say yes

is there like a safe

do I see somewhere that seems like it'd

be a safe distance that's like kind of

hidden away from this beholder yeah you

could hide behind the the stone bulk of

the fireplace you can actually go all

the way I was gonna say you could take

my fireplace spot how far is that from

your point of view it's probably about

like 15 feet away okay is there anything

farther other than finding a way

upstairs no or Gore going outside

there's tonight can I see you outside

yeah through broken windows you can see

out into the rainy night alright this

beholder like like Pena

thing comes out and I get up I say it

I'm just like nope I just open a

dimension door and disappear outside all

right after you leave the rest of you

see what it looks like a Magic Mouse

appear on the beholder where it should

be

nope and it says I watch you watch but

I'm exactly what you need

your paltin from outside

see that's why nope take my turn feed

satisfaction killing Kade I get that

reference

all right and it is no rise turn okay so

pulling herself peeling herself yes as

you pick yourself up you see a dimension

door out in the rain up here and palton

is about like 50 feet away outside the

house standing in the huh peeling

herself from the cot from the wet

cobblestones and popping her neck with a

grizzly cracking sound reminiscent of

shuffling cards she looks back into the

remains of the house little fires

running here and there yeah and would

she see to Lippard you I'm gonna roll

for that you would see tulip taking

stock of all the surroundings you see

her she's sort of lying under a table

its net yeah she's not moving okay so so

her eyes will get wide and kind of

looking around for a spot that looks

relatively stable and relatively dark

she's going to duck into the shadows and

shadow step to shadow step to tulip okay

and and kind of like grab her yes you

emerge from the shadows right next to

tulip and sort of hoist her up to close

to your body and she is limp she's just

all right okay like sort of

like sort of sit her up on my hip I

guess something like that and then is

there anyone else in in here because

because dolphins like over there so

death is about about 10 feet away out

just next to a fireplace and then evylyn

is about 10 feet away but down in the

basement in front of you I'm going to

look at the ass and just say where are

the rest of the children they're all

upstairs we need to leave now but but

steely-eyed she will say we need to get

out of here or we need to get them out

of here yeah now shadow step for you is

a bonus section that is a bonus action

school you still have your move so is

there time for is there time for Diaz to

answer or just like indicators deaath

we'll just look upstairs she's going to

it's that's the stairs are gone the

stairs are gone now there's just a hole

in the ceiling leading up to the level

above okay now she could because the

ceilings aren't terribly high she could

basically try to spring off a table and

grab the lip of the hole but that worked

that would be hard to do with the

tiefling in her hands okay would I have

noticed the exterior staircase when I

was scoping out the place yes okay I'm

going to it's actually behind the wall

that you're standing next to right now

but there's no window evidence so in

that case I'm going to look at deaaath

and just kind of curtly not use my move

to bring Tulip out to the porch and then

whatever remains of it and as soon as

I've put her in a safe spot whatever

remains of my move will be used to try

and get up to the stairs okay it'll be

40 feet to get her out of the building

okay I have another 10 feet to get up

the

looking toward the stairs okay so you

make your way toward the stage alright

so sister Nura acts quickly takes a

tulip out and then disappears from view

of most other characters except paltin

who sees her deke around the corner of

the building and then it is it would be

the trolls turn but they're dead

evylyn so you're standing in the

wreckage of the basement with Nazca the

undead ogre holding the beholder pinata

he called that the paltin and said I'm

not what you want but I'm exactly what

you need do I have a sense of whether

that is that kenyatta thing is an enemy

it looks it looks like an object

strapped to the end of a fishing pole

which has a magical mouth on it and

noskov holding it know the undead ogre

standing next and I was holding it it

looks too big and awkward for a

one-armed dwarf to carry around

well Nazca just said we've never met

before right

so I'm gonna say I see and it's almost

as though things are now coming to light

and we may now know each other in this

moment she's like trying really hard to

like ask are you a double agent but

she's really not good at like

doublespeak at all so I know yeah she

says that to him and he says you have

trifled with the zenith are and killed

his minions and

you must pay a terrible price a terrible

price sure okay she rose at ten okay

she's a little bit confused by this your

but your best cents is even with a ten

that he is behaving the way a child

behaves when they're with their parent

and they realize they've done a bad

thing and they don't want the parent to

know okay and no one is now in imminent

danger right not unless the beholder

does something okay so there's no

threatening posture here okay

even's gonna hold action with the flame

sword okay until the either of them do

anything threatening oh what a question

the trash elemental is gone right it is

still alive up on the upper level okay

good to know

thank you okay and now it is strict

cistern ah no one's attacking not at the

moment but you did hear nasca call out

for rats he did call out for a second

wave which way are the rats

do I hear rats there is the pipe music

music yeah they make a check make a

check perception 14 you don't hear

anything else besides the pipe music

from deeper and the sewers or bowels of

that dark tunnel oh I think what I'm

gonna do can I bring my chickens down

here uh there station area thank you

double check that spirit Guardians right

yes if they're not stationary then I'm

going to recast it

at fifth level they flit around you to a

distance of 15 feet so if you move that

they presumably go with you okay I would

like to have those chickens with me okay

and maybe position them where I hear

this music coming from that would be the

tunnel that the ogre zombie just came

out of okay so I'm just gonna out there

just I think there's like what two of

them they circle around you so they're

basically in a 15 foot perimeter around

you okay

okay cool so the chickens really and

they're gonna go just I'm gonna get kind

of close to that door and just position

it so that the chickens are sort of in

the way of that door okay that will put

you between that tunnel and Nazca and

the zombies you'll be between them all

right okay I'm just gonna shuffle over

there nazca looks very concerned about

the chickens just like talking I'm still

holding okay and then it is d ass turn

DF you see the garbage monster to start

to shamble back into its form you see

the ogre zombie look sort of hungrily

towards strix over its shoulder and

you can actually see that the zombie

sort of clenches that rod and looks like

it might just whack her with it or

something uh-huh and where restricts

going towards the tunnel toward the

tunnel standing in front of interposing

herself in the tunnel cool with the

intention of doing something stupid I

know

[Laughter]

so the garbage monster is it does it

seem to me like it's still trying to

pose a threat to me or yes it does and

you being the only real threat up here

at the moment seemed the most likely

target

cool that's only because I'm still up on

this floor right right yes right I just

I hate Nausicaa I hate him

so DF is going to stand up pull out

gutter in one hand reverse grip pull out

moon splinter from the other um my blade

is bigger stay quiet you look at what

you want yeah

well I'm standing up goes to misty step

using moon splinter but he's jumping

backwards at the same time so I just

jumping backwards he's vanishing making

it look like he's going that way and

he's going to appear directly behind

Nazca and put gutter to his back okay

done then Amelia says oh call him off

now this is I he sort of looks up at the

beholder swinging on the end of the the

fishing pole and says ah doesn't look

like I have much choice and he he says

but

maybe maybe you should negotiate with my

boss does anethe our gift not just the

point of the sword in tone just a little

bit and says I'm negotiating right now

oh yeah okay uh right um but I'm just an

enforcer I I don't have negotiating

skills also the so the the magic mouth

on this beholder puppet yeah this this

seems like it's only delivering a

message it's not conversing with us were

correct all right again D F is like like

that blade just close to piercing

through him in that breaking skin

through his back and says tell them to

all go away or you fall here when do you

does that strikes turns hurt the pie pan

into the aloe vera washing and just like

holes it's okay he will say uh we I'm

calling off the attack everybody stand

down sigh down and he will sort of

untighten his crossbow just so good and

says I think we could call this a

victory DF well well then say yep this

is they're all part of the negotiations

and he'll lead in close to Nazca and try

to whisper something to his ear and

hopes that perhaps other people nearby

bainite here at certain individuals and

just say if you

negotiations tell your boss I know what

this entire I'm want and where they're

going okay call up for your tax leave

must be and you'll get what you want to

make it perception our persuasion check

or intimidate actually because you've

got a nice blue back okay what is my

intimidate with your plush toy its kind

of killing the mood here Strix

eight okay scary demon wish all right

he don't so your nervousness seems to

register with him amen and talked about

right he says the the zanaffar is not to

be trifled with and he he always gets

what he wants and he wants you to pay

for all the crimes that you've committed

against him and his organization I

forget what was Narae Narae during all

this where was he oh okay yeah so he

wouldn't she wouldn't have heard your

and doesn't arm yeah okay good dear fool

in say I I'm trying to repay at no point

that we have any quarrel with you I'm

leave us alone let me keep doing my

thing and I can keep giving you the

information and things that you need so

your attacks your hostilities completely

misguided uh-huh uh-huh okay and so so

you want me to tell this Anitha then

that hostility should stop and that

you'll give information Val

some kind right tell him that the

santarem trust me okay and should your

boss if he knows anything about

negotiations business and what the value

that information has he'll know that

this is not an opportunity he wants to

ruin the the garbage monster sort of

leaps off and tries to land on top of

strikes I don't I don't control that so

it just falls on top of us-- tricks this

massive garbage this buries you it

rolled a twenty six on the attack role

so yeah it's gonna hit that yeah it does

thirteen points of damage as it lands on

top of you and you are engulfed so as it

falls on her there's just like a hand

sticking out with like an al bear toy

but but now strix is completely

submerged in this garbage monster what's

that thirteen yep thirteen points of

damage the kids come barreling down the

stairs the side stairs are there no not

the a not the spiral staircase this is

this is farther upstairs they come down

from the third floor to the second floor

into the second floor hall and when they

get to the bottom of the hall I would

like all of them to roll a d20 squid rod

Jenks and that Jenks got a fourteen okay

thirteen so as they're making the way

across the hall the damage on the floor

below has weakened the floor here and

now

goes through a weakened section no

so roll another do roll another d24 me

in it James calls out some spells that

aren't real yeah feather fall okay so

that goes through that goes through the

roof tries to grab hold of like some

rafters and lanterns in the tap room to

break her fall but none of them get

close and she just sort of falls and

lands in the basement on the ridge that

would put her there

yes so at this point in time

evylyn she is basically falling on top

of you

so you see this kid fall and just make a

dexterity check one hand just use one

hand you sell a flaming sword one hand

yeah Anna come on you're saving yourself

here Anna okay doesn't even notice her

really okay and so and yeah so and that

just goes into the refuse and debris all

in the basement right next to the

garbage monster actually and squiggly

and Jenks you look through a hole in the

ceiling down into the tap room

yeah you okay don't say anything if

you're alive what how is she

well let's see she fell about a total of

let's say that being about 15 feet and

[Music]

you're not sure she's just kind of great

lying there at the moment well cool so

it is now Paul tins turn okay so I am

outside yes you are away from garbage

monster who I did I see it like jump

down no that would have been in too far

inside okay for you to have seen so I'm

just kind of is you hear a voice behind

you and above you and there's a there's

a silhouette in a window shouting what

is going on over there

unlike in another house yeah across the

square

Oh your lawn it's like what's going on

up there Paul Turner he's like go to

pose and sleep like normal folk know

your damn business need your forty hours

I hate festivals they hate you alright

fine and what do you do after that

exchange it's just definitely a movie

after that so is anything really

happening out here it's raining and but

other than that no when you look at down

troll skull alley there's nobody out

everybody is inside there's lights in

windows all down the square you can see

the rain-drenched wicker troll

was sort of set up in the middle of the

square that never got lit here because

the weather turns sour mm-hmm and it's

just kind of gauss tin the rain

it makes for a sort of a strange

haunting presence though i'm staring

blindly in your direction

okay good man can anyone do I think

anyone can hear can I like call out to

see if anyone can hear me in sure yeah

and since there's no windows or anything

when you call out they can hear you

hey who's who's who's around who hears

me you hear a voice out in the rain of

paltin oh all of us except for an arai

and Strix cuz she's got garbage inner

ears am i far from him or is he unlike

the other end of the manor for me he's

out and he's out in front of the manor

actually you would hear him too as

you're making your way up the stairs

okay I mean but you wouldn't be able to

see him from your angle okay at the

voice okay I guess nobody's responding

to you falton I'll just I'll shout back

note right evylyn hi all right good

enough and I'll just do another Bartok

inspiration okay so you start playing

out in the rain

yep all right great I'll just just like

slamming on the loo with like water

drops falling on your eye at the top of

the stairs you get to a door that's

locked cuz I'm like looking for these

kids your elbows here ending I see the

kids come down through the hall I can do

yours you've got a door blocking any

view you have to the inside of the

second floor okay I know the kids are

upstairs yeah

now above you above you there is a

window on the third floor

that's probably closer to where you want

to get to or you could try to get

through this door there's no window on

my current floor correct okay I will

I'm going to move up to the top of the

stairs check the window you kind of have

to leap up to it to reach it okay

I mean I'll just basically what I'm

gonna do this just sweep the house for

the kids and take it and at the moment

at the moment you can't get into the

house okay you're on the outside

staircase leading up to the second floor

and you come to a door that's locked and

a window on the level above okay I'm

just going to make an assumption I'm

gonna go for the door

and I will roll I assume a strength

checker answer personally yeah

yeah it's just a strength strength

athletics all right cool it's kind of an

old narrow door so okay I rolled a 14

you barrel through it okay okay so you

kick it open you can see a room that has

bits of what used to be a spiral

staircase sort of strewn across it it

looks like an old common room but it's

just really kind of a dusty old empty

room at the moment with some grime

covered with a grime covered window at

one end and two open doors leading one

way and the other and through one of the

open doors you can see a hallway that

has two kids looking down a hole in the

floor one of the kids is a tiefling boy

with an eyepatch and the other one is a

portly human boy wearing like a wizard's

robe and clutching a little stuffed owl

bear these are the kids that were

immediately hustled upstairs when after

when after I arrived before I arrived

two of them

the third appears to be missing a taller

girl um I'm going to with my oh you're

gonna say something nope

with my hands kind of like up muted okay

so with my hands kind of up to show that

I don't mean any harm yeah I'm going to

to none

aggressively jog slash run toward them

and say where's the third one of you

Quigley immediately shoots an arrow

Adams so yeah you see this wonderful I

got just so you see this one you see

this woman come at you just roll your d

2810 okay okay so warning shot um can I

roll through that because I have yeah

you don't even have to yes so this this

arrow comes at you and you just catch it

in the air I'm gonna give the the T the

chief link kid the hairy eyeball yeah

the look that says none of that and says

I'm here to help

where's the third one of you can I have

that back an exhausted sigh and holding

it out to him without looking and then

looking peering down the hole when you

look through the hole and the burnt

Timbers you can see that the little girl

fell quite a distance not only down into

the tap room but way down into the

basement no okay I'm going to turn to

them and just say head out the back

staircase your friend with the loot is

outside Oh what about should we get the

owl bear

I'm glad you mentioned that because as

you as thanks or as Jenks sort of points

you turn you see this al bear come

barreling out of the other door across

the hall right for you your squealing is

like that's our fish yeah so and it's

very clear to you narai that the the

this creature is just ginormous this al

bear is very very big gray feather

creature it's it's slobbering and

charging toward you threatening Li okay

um does the kid have any effect on this

thing so when he calls out to it she

sort of puts on the brakes and kind of

stops and then just sort of stairs I'm

going to look at them all three of them

having looked down this floor hole at

the the crumpled body of a third kid

yeah and I'm going to I'm going to look

at the look at the non bow-and-arrow kid

who did not try and shoot me mm-hmm

and say the back staircase and then is

there a shadow nearby that I can step oh

yeah there's lots okay great so I will I

will shadow step my way to the basement

to tend to this kid all right so you

appear out of shadow next to the kid

okay and then and then there's a there's

the bagpipe music playing out in the

rain what is going on okay

okay so having having move

and shad and shadow steps yes I still

have an attack that I can make is it

immediately apparent to me that Strix is

being garbage yes yes great very requiem

for a dream yeah

died in what I love there's any

opportunity would using an eldritch

blast hurt her no okay done all right

so crackling energy erupts from sister

and awry does it come from your hand has

it come from your eyes or mouth what no

it'd just be for my hand okay great you

start to blast the crap out of this

garbage pile which is really all that it

is yep so that's gonna be doable for

that there's an attack role okay yeah

using your spell okay first attack is an

11 plus 6 this 17 next one is a 9 plus 6

so 2 hits yeah 1315 keeps P up I'm bad

at math what d-10 oh jeez this is a die

I don't have out first one is gonna be

too damaged all right so you start to

just vaporize pieces of this creature

but there's more of it to love and then

it is evil ins turned so evil in narai

just sort of appeared out of the shadows

right next to you

next to the kid and next to the garbage

monster which he is currently blasting

with beams of energy and I saw this

child to fall right next to me yes I

would like to follow child okay she

looks like she could use some healing is

it the blood that tipped you off like

the way your bones are sticking out I

want to gather her up okay and lay on

hand all right how much healing you want

to give her

doesn't look like it doesn't look like

there's much to her she's a thin rail of

a girl so yeah I mean even would have

some sense of how much healing a little

girl these like five okay yeah so she

gives her all that maybe maybe like

seven for good measure

okay yeah so now for any biased reasons

so so nat you awaken with hip your hip

points back and sort of cradled in the

arms of this saintly figure not wakes up

and says thank you and then she says

where's diya she probably sees DF in not

too far away like maybe seven eight feet

away with a blade to a Dwarfs back and

she she feels great now right yeah she's

totally fine it she there is no real

Hall any any broken bones she may have

had in the fall just gone

then she'll give even a look like fellow

adventurer and then jump out of her her

arms okay and brandish her stores yeah

okay and she she goes to like a diya

she doesn't like actually you know stab

anybody but she goes like and takes

position at his side like his little

like sidekick

great evil and are you happy to be done

at this point there uh that would just

lose your action to lay on hands yeah

[Music]

so DF at this point you've now got this

girl waving a wooden sword at the dwarf

who calls out great Evo scarus we're

done here uh we should go back to the

lair and tell tell the santa thar

victory

they've been they've been duly

intimidated by our presence Diaz will

then take Nazca and actually

turn around by the shoulders still sword

pointy at them and just kind of keep

talking to them and we'll say remember

I'm letting you live because you need to

tell Zenith our I know what he's after I

know isn't our more after it to just

leave us alone

let me do my thing and I can help get

you whatever it is that you need cool

until you until he thinks that you were

any harm to him whatsoever

no I'm out of harm to him will matters

the moment he gets the stone of galore

just tell him I can help him find the

stone strix you're in the garbage pile

being devoured and what would you like

to do those can I still get in action

you haven't actually acted Yeti yeah you

go after the so as like nice guy starts

repeating that to himself

yes like good good now if you'll excuse

me and you're like least backwards

there's like a spinning slash back at

the trash monster that Strix is like

stuck in okay go ahead and have at it

and Strix what would you like to do

dropped my staff correct yeah well while

you're engulfed by this creature you are

blinded and restrained and unable to

breathe once I want to say for the

record because I know Strix is stuck in

there I'm actually going to use human

determination to take advantage on this

attack role okay

because I don't want the criticalness

much better uh 22 okay that's gonna hit

good now since I had advantage on this

attack role mm-hmm

would you say that this was a sneaky

attack absolutely a lie engulfed in

trash history Strix are you doing

anything while this is going on you know

I felt a little bit better but you know

that's just really what it is you know

I've lost my staff it's now tombola out

of my hand it's 26 26 okay you are able

to slay the garbage monster it just sort

of falls apart around her and strikes

you just sort of sit up actually since

at this point in time the dwarf says

okay I better get back to the zamindar's

lair before I forget uh dear fool I kind

of kneel down to Strix to make sure like

she's okay and looked back up at Nazca

and just say yes move quickly

don't forget and should this if Santa

Thor has any wits about him he'll know

that this is this could be a very

profitable investment mmm yeah and he

makes his way back toward the tunnel and

he sort of tells commands the ogre to

follow him as the ogre leaving yes your

Paulding from like outside just like oh

[Laughter]

wait a minute

okay the the ogre just drops the fishing

pole in the pinata on the floor and

lumbers after Nazca and the two of them

disappear back down the tunnel

eye strikes from the floor you just hear

this I think I think we should close

this gift kinda gives her like a like

this spitting sound and this little

fountain of garb

and then you hear her voice yeah d/f

kind of gives her a look of like you're

right awful that's adorable also like

come on just kinda like alright we are

out of initiative

you see paltin like run down as he's

gone just like a like where'd he go

I mean not that I you know it's just he

owes us rent I'll pick up my owl bear

plushie and turn it back into my staff

okay I would like to look at that pinata

yeah you can see it's just lying there

on the end of a rope tied to this pole

this 10-foot pole and that's literally

what it is just like an adventure is

ten-foot pole with this thing strapped

to the end of it but you check out the

pinata sit spur out of initiative idea

to immediately turn to evil in and tell

her to find the other children okay you

are I'm in the other children by the way

Jenks and squidly you can hear DF say

that through the hole on the floor that

you're staring down yeah make sure

they're okay even goes running off but

he's like ah - did you got it like you

got it I totally got dibs while she's

going and so it real quick before Evelyn

flees you flee you fled to like check

for the kids right okay so real quick

before Evelyn flees all the other there

I says all of the children are accounted

for she says I checked myself and closed

the tunnel I say you should close the

house if your enemies no way you're live

and can come and knock on your door or

worse yet burrow into your basement I

would worry for any children you're

keeping here you can have an armory or

an orphanage but not both I mean I

disagree not that attitude

[Laughter]

all right so Evelyn you flutter up to

the hole in the roof and see jinx and

squidly there and waffles I kind of you

know passed over them and got them if

they're okay they seem fine yeah am I am

I in the same like vicinity as evylyn

when you come back inside and you're

drenched paltin you can see evil in

flooding fluttering up in a hole in the

roof of the tap room oh I'm just like

hey me when when you got a second hey

like you like just points to himself

like his arms like dislocated he's just

like his hand holding a grade D of

clothes no rush but uh feeling so great

Oh evil and uh like I don't know

finishes fussing over the kids and she's

like waffles will you bring them

downstairs and like has them get on

waffles the waffles could bring them

down and then immediately flutters down

to Politan and she's like reset his

shoulder yeah she actually grabs it oh

it was good oh no it's fine that's fine

oh Jesus okay great I mean whoever great

how many units of feeling bad do you

feel are you in a five I'm feeling at

like I'm kind of hanging around a 5 out

of 69 oh well even like grabs his cheeks

she's like here just five times your

level yeah and you've used five on

Matt so you would have fatty yeah yes

all right yeah this is the biggest juice

healing you've ever gotten while you

were conscious so that probably feels

pretty good oh well that was nice yeah

your bones don't hurt so much now got

him I got it yeah so all that's left now

amid the smoldering wreckage and most of

the fire sir are still kind of like

burning a little isolation little

pockets a flame left caught things and

they're just sort of burning merrily

away direct the unseen servants to get

like small cups of water just aren't

pouring out the fires well did you think

you still have cups at all yes the

unseen servants are actually kind of

bound to certain rooms so what the ones

in that room were kind of destroyed last

time great so we're missing a floor and

we have worthless unseen servants now I

mean you haven't seen servants in the

kitchen you have them in the upstairs

rooms in the upstairs halls yes but I

might have to put that out on Craigslist

gathered outside of the house okay so

the boom of the explosion would have

been quite loud people would have heard

and felt but the outside of the

structure apart from the busted out

windows on the ground floor the house is

still intact it's fine it's all internal

damage all we need to do is make the

house stronger we can do that let's just

make it impenetrable I like that idea

you know I was thinking actually some

like metal plates would go really well

here and she's already eelain's kind of

going to wear this the spiral staircase

was just finished and then demolished

like she's just optimistically like you

know better now that this is and she's

starting to like drop a blue Prince in

the air maybe we can steal an iron fence

from another building and animate it and

walk it over to ours we're not stealing

anyone's fence unless you guys know of

anything that can any kind of material

that's impervious to disintegration

beams strikes let's crestfallen please

no not bards yeah

and now you have a tunnel right to the

sewers that's convenient

oh yeah yes thinking about that all

right

so as you sort of as things settle down

it's still it still rains throughout the

night on and off so yeah excuse me

realizing that no one is out there with

her yeah or I will immediately y'all use

whatever shadowstep I can to make my way

out to her and check on her and get her

yeah okay when she gets out there you're

pretty sure the kids dead nice

she did not stabilize on her own sure I

grabs her anyway

yep and brings her inside okay

and says who here can heal her eyes are

starting to get wet you can't tell if

it's rain or not and she's going to set

tulip on the ground and say please do

something anything uh so when you say

you're pretty sure she's dead Chris we

look at her and we know that like

traditional healing is not gonna help

you can make a medicine check Anna for

evil if you want medicine I got 15 okay

yeah she's beyond just healing curators

at this point she's dead and oh good

do you happen to have diamonds worth 300

that's only true resurrection no I have

revivify oh yeah but I don't happen to

have 300 gold pieces worth of diamonds

usually we don't do spell components but

I feel like that one's a big one

Chris Perkins I don't know do I get to

do revivify without the divers no I need

the diamonds and you also have to do it

within a minute Paul Tain's gonna walk

up to the body and just kind of kneel

down and then just like put a hand on

her mm-hmm and go Perkins if you're

listening

how much XP is this one worth just

whatever Wow

feeling really ripped off right now okay

and then he he like gets back he's like

I'm sorry there's nothing we can do we

can barrier strikes just starts like

taking your staff and just doing the

whole lines in there maybe she'll be a

ghost and can live here ghost orphanage

big dick no rice just going to you see

it's like very much like a get back in

there tear kind of thing where you see

her just like just like a shudder moves

through her and then it just gets kind

of shoved away and she kind of steals

her jaw and she just says a tiny quaver

in her voice this is what happens when

children get tied up in these things

even kind of like a tear Wells up and

she kneels down next to paltin next to

tulip and kind of just like you know

lays her hands on her that says does a

prayer to Lysander about new beginnings

and new Dawn's but that like this day

was too short

basically yeah and not by the way is

right there as well she's boys are still

upstairs with the albear making their

way down but she's there yeah I would

say not the adventurer maybe he has

never actually seen someone die before

huh probably not I mean this is in water

deep death is a you know it's kids

aren't necessarily sheltered from it to

a great extent but this is probably the

first time she's ever seen somebody like

her age yeah

died I think she is trying really hard

to hide it because she's trying to be

cool and an adventurer but I think she's

like kind of trembling and like you know

what tears running down her cheek yeah

okay and then the boys arrived with

waffles eventually and they to see dead

tulip that's up to you guys I think

strikes by this point has at least put a

crevice in the ground just like roller

in there she's doing her best like in

the house though or like in the dirt

basement like it has got a best for a

child under this house you are haunting

yeah okay okay well she gets on her

broom and flies up to our room death

will take a need next to tulip and

sister to Rye and say there's nothing we

can do for her here

but that doesn't mean it's in it's the

end I know this isn't our own I know you

have connections and there's plenty of

people here that can help her but this

is beyond anything a weekend Tarot we

know the children aren't safe not here

but we will protect them well there are

places that we can go and make sure that

they'll stay alive I know the zanaffar

are after them and I'm going to yeah so

so Neriah is going to

turn to him turn to deaaath and say I

will do what I may

but until then pray for a raven she says

I I lost a child of my own to this kind

of violence it's why her other mother

left she said a line of work like mine

was no place for a family and I think

she's right and if you find yourself

with enough children around here I worry

for their fates people like you can see

what really kind of take this heart like

this life is no place for a family he's

kind of moved over to try and comfort

the other kids and like hug them and

stuff and she's kind of saying you know

trying to explain death to them and

everything but as she hears this she's

like you see that really hit her really

hard the rain stops outside yet squidly

is like poking the body with a stick of

course he is

no I think she's dead

yes deal say then no actually squidly

you might actually know her

so tulip is also a resident of the

city's doc ward and being a tiefling you

and her probably have crossed paths you

might you might have met her or she

might have tried to encroach upon your

territory or something like that you

probably had many sort of bickering

spats with her but she is she's another

homeless waif who basically eked out a

living by the docks

she lived in a like a number of

doctrines do in crate old crates and

barrels and things she probably had a

barrel

squidly he always thought he was a

horrible person but you know yeah he

doesn't really convey any of this yeah

it's just like huh

that sucks yeah death will say to nor I

no no this is no life and no place for

children do what you will with tulip I

mean I can see the personal ties here

and she belongs with you that's for the

rest we can take care of them we have a

place that we can bring them and I ask

that you trust us you understand how my

trust may come with difficulty

considering that I overheard what you

said to that agent of sanitize right and

I'm glad you did you think I want to

work for the zanaffar

at all but now if they think at all I'm

willing to cooperate with them I can get

you and the rest isn't Aram much more

information than you could ever hope for

he just destroyed my house almost killed

my companions slayed a child you think I

want anything to do with the zenith or I

don't know who you want anything to do

with but positioning yourself between

the Zentrum and zanaffar you're a kite

in a hurricane deaaath good illustration

she's going to set her jaw and say do

you know of any other reason why they

may want to break into your house any

other artifacts or drawers they might be

looking for anything they could use

against you were you deprived of it

death Kyle thinks himself it almost

looks up to you there's like there's no

nothing

do you think they're looking for room

yeah that Strix is in their room by the

way states when you get up to when you

get up to your room Strix you can see

that things are kind of knocked out of

place by the shutter of the house you

kind of have to sort through all that

stuff get put things back up on shelves

the reason blow up the reason that I

asked Dion is because our informants

have traced the location of a powerful

artifact to you and we worry that it may

put you in far greater danger than

you've anticipated what what the heck

that we do it's a ring the ring of

winter will slow turn to palton the ring

of winter is so powerful and Prasant

that it can be detected it but I by many

and it's an item of power as I'm sure

you know if you've been in possession

ever try and give any amount of time

yeah we met if you're in possession of

it I'm offering right now to rid you of

it I know a place where it can be dealt

with accordingly but I worry that if

you're to go on retaining it you could

be bringing a great more deal of danger

to yourself than just necessary and

we've already seen what kind of danger

you've brought to yourself so far she

says glancing pretty obviously at the

body and right right dead dead kids got

it I don't have it

who does we don't know that's true

we haven't seen it since what the hell

were we here from Lexus yeah the less

unless I heard it was taken to a

different plane of existence and from

there was just it was gone

Alton great himself of it hmm I don't

know meanwhile even yep even even is has

jinks like all snuggled up on her lap

and is playing with the little owl bear

with your nice lady and you don't smell

bad I think you're nice too

she's just you don't know magic so

you're not as cool I mean good no I'm

good bones just like so but it was are

you saying it was traced here or I was

saying that people know that you have it

or at least had it but I you're the last

known owners at least as far as our

informants know and you they're pretty

good at their job yeah can't be that

great yeah I don't know how to say it

but it seems like you have inaccurate

intelligence very we don't have it then

we'll keep looking and register

redistribute but I warn you the more

power you attract yourself the more

attention you attract and the more

attention you attract the more people

are going to want a piece of that power

yeah yeah and the more attention and

power we attract the better our show's

gonna be it's fine we all glanced at

curtains like we don't have it and so if

you can just like let whoever thinks we

have it know that we don't have it

because like I I don't I don't I don't

feel like explaining to that and like

every time so all the rooms go blow

their house up it's like that's a lot of

rent out dude and like where I'm getting

to the point where we might need to cut

our losses on this property like look

it's we're gonna we're gonna put more

into it than did probably was initially

put so this this is this is

this is a house shaped like shell at

this point yeah like but it's our home

home is wherever we are that's a great

way to think about it Paulton and I

would strongly recommend that if Shanna

thorne knows where your base of

operations is perhaps it's time to find

a new basis well now that I've been told

that I don't wanna we'll worry about

that sister narai until then take tulip

and we all hope for your sake you to

find the ring of winter because we too

believe it needs to be in stored away

safely where none can reach it it

belongs in a museum

she's going to walk gently over the

corpse and walk yeah walk quietly over

to the corpse and pick her up and kind

of hold hold her against her not like a

like lead kind of like the dead body

like out in front but almost like like a

like a child and look at all of them and

just say I worry I worry that this isn't

over and I worry how more how many more

it will touch before it is and then

stepping back into darkness she

disappear right in the shadow engulfs

her and she and the dead child are gone

looking at the children

well then turned towards evil in and say

evil in we might need you to pull some

strings on this one what kind of

strength some temple strings oh yeah

fine that's my job okay

the night has been obviously if then

fold the rain has stopped and your guest

is gone everything is settled down at

this point there's no point in cleaning

up until the morning let's just go to

bed

can even like are there any surviving

bottles of alcohol anywhere not in the

tap room now okay Bert for bed that I've

got a secret reserve or something well

she wanted to bring Paulson some things

okay yeah because she wanted to walk up

to him and like you know maybe she's

kind of made sure the kids are okay and

everything and she wants to be like you

know I I don't know this this god of

yours Perkins but I think it's real nice

that you're starting to believe in

something I thought I saw you praying to

have over a tulip and I I don't know

maybe you could tell me about him

sometimes just kind of looks at my eyes

just like so do you retire for the

evening yeah well if we go to if we go

to bed that night

death will actually spend the first few

hours in the children's room making sure

that I actually get to sleep okay okay

and speaking of which where have you

been sir have you been putting them in

basically the guest room yeah like that

I imagine all three of them were in one

room right okay in that case there

they're probably surrounded by all the

Strix is excess paraphernalia constricts

has been filling up the room with all

kinds of herbs and but she's really

upset that her dramatic entrance into

her room was interrupted by them having

to go to bed so she's just laying still

curled can-can evil in India like act

out a bedtime story for them oh no okay

that's all I'm saying I actually don't I

don't know any oh yeah that was my way

cool so you terrify I'm about a big tall

walking man me answering out yeah

Oh Strix likes that she gets back up and

then is like

in the corner all right well the kids

love these stories about murder and

mayhem when they're not you know in it

and you tuck them in they go to sleep

like you know just another regular day

in the Waffle House before bed paltin

like lays his head down on his pillow

he's just like thinking to himself he

goes but who is Brooks the following

morning

you walk out to the city of the Dead the

Parkland Cemetery of Waterdeep and you

meet Astrid Horne at the foot of the

statue of agar on the city's founder and

she says to you this dwarf do they have

the ring of winter or not no it was

taken from them it's in the shadow fell

the quest continues I suppose wait for

orders yes ma'am

evylyn you're probably the last to go to

bed is your the night owl when you walk

in the door make a dexterity saving

through okay you opened the door you

here playing and this axe comes spinning

at your head yeah it sort of goes flying

out into the hall behind ya like you see

Simon Simon is lying lifeless on the

floor live with it like pretending to be

an inanimate doll but then sort of tilts

his head up and looks when he sees you

and he just like knocks his head down on

the floor a few times he picks him up

and she's just learned a couple sides

from him at bat so she was like that was

good

good job yeah he starts to sort of

dismantle everything and he leaves your

room with the ax hooker under his arm

can she like walk with him to falls

ready yeah yeah she she doesn't want to

if he was hitting his head on the floor

she feels like maybe he's disappointed

in himself and she wants him to feel

proud she wants to go tell assignment

about what a beautiful accent when you

get to Poland's room you see Patton's

out like a light and and so the Simon

just quietly climbs up onto bed and lies

in bed next to him which he's only been

doing since the tour it blew up and so

you kind of tuck Simon in and he does

sort of like a fakie on blinks his eyes

and then closes them she gives them a

little kiss on the cheek and then go-go

the way all right and that's where we'll

stop for tonight oh nice yeah no

poignant and bittersweet just yeah yes
