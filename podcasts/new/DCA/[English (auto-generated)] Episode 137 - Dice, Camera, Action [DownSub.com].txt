still in for HP hi everybody welcome to

dice camera action definitely the first

attempt after 137 episodes we were bound

to get it wrong at some point okay so

let's see a lot has happened when last

we left the waffle crew in this timeline

they were unless let's back up a little

bit so DF was on a quest to reunite

evylyn with her weapon of choice

lightful the axe and set out to

reconstruct it and got a little bit of

help from Strix and from Jarl axel as

well and what did ja relax I'll get for

his trouble a lot of unpleasantness and

bad-mouthing from one palton SEPA and as

he as it as raised it which didn't sit

too well with the Dark Elf lothario but

he bit his tongue some time later the

waffle crew was called upon by rosy be

Stingers attorney to help figure out who

was responsible for rosy bee stingers

demise turned out all a clever ploy to

expose a member of the bee stinger

family who is not on the up-and-up the

waffle crew cracked the case they solved

all the clues and cornered the fiend who

revealed its true form and got smacked

around by the waffle crew and the bee

stinger clan but not before knocking

palton off a rooftop and dropping him to

four hit points and will pick up right

from there with palton you're lying on

the cobblestone street there's a big

huzzah from somewhere on the other side

of the building after the demon Falls to

its doom you had just finished playing

on your lute in an inspiring tune which

I guess must have done the trick mm-hmm

I hear the huzzah yeah just this crowd

of people from the other side and that's

when your lute just sort of falls to

pieces

around you what it has strummed its last

strum cool still have these I take out

the castanets that I've had yeah you can

see one of them is bent well at least I

still have my bagpipes right you can

sort of pull yourself up off the street

pick up your dignity and the rest of you

hmm

just like gathering it up off the floor

yeah there's what's left of it

Cool Hand Roo will come after scuttling

around the building will come crawling

over to you and tap your foot yep at

least you're okay cool

can't wait for the bleeding to stop I

used my same character sheet for the

c-team and I can't remember Holly or

Jarrod Holly did I heal you during this

last fight I believe that you did I

think it I believe you did 440 I want us

okay that's what I thought too so I have

20 left yes you did heal me and I can

also heal as well so if you don't need

to burn that if you want me to do

something so evil in Strix and DF you

lost sight of paltin after he got flung

back off the rooftop you're not sure if

he's alive or dead at this point

well you heard the music so but that is

now now it's stopped so we heard the

bagpipe go yeah and I like slowly hobble

my way over to the other side okay then

you will see the the profusely bleeding

badly battered yet somehow blessed with

adventurers bones paltin hobbling toward

you I'm like delusional I'm so close to

death I'm just like friends I've I've

come to realise

err at the error of my ways and my life

needs guidance you found Lysander in

your heart oh we have to heal him really

fast the whole time

improve praise be to our Lord coming

true this is so beautiful she bows

cheeks with Andrew loves you and he

always will I'd starts running down your

hands the ashen his dead the light comes

toward me now running down is dripping

off his chin no to take me up like off

up a little bow I just fix that up I

know yeah I heal him for nine hit points

okay at this point hazard was drumming

impatiently on his shoulders but you

heal him for nine and at least that

closes up some of the nastier gashes on

his head and body like start to come to

but not totally there is just like you

know like I appreciate the concept of

Lysander for sure I'm just wondering

wondering how good is it to really

follow that blindly put so much on this

entity oh but don't you see it's not

blind it's it's flooded with light you

can see every detail no actually it is

wide I can't really see right oh here

let me wipe that blood out of your eyes

evylyn does a little lay on hands on his

face for 20 okay no it doesn't clean

doesn't just erase the blood but it does

make him feel better

he's like you got 20 for me what

happened you found the fan er where was

he in you all along I met that guy yeah

he you want anyway it's fine yeah praise

be and whatnot I feel so much closer to

you now we'll have so much to talk about

I've been so excited because Jarrell

acts is like the only one in the whole

world who wants to talk to me about what

thandor but if you want to talk about

with Zander I'd love to talk to you

about with Zander we could spend all

sorts of time to get there talking about

with ander if you wanted to so you have

this conversation on the way back home

cuz I mean I love spending time with you

I know you know that I love spending

time with you and I know that sometimes

you don't really have much that you find

interesting to talk to me about but if

Lysander's interesting I definitely have

lots to say about levander and you and I

could hang out and we could talk about

levander for blocks later switch is just

covering your ears the whole time I'm

just like going cool when you get back

to the waffle crew it is a waffle waffle

house it's exactly as you left it

as you recall before before you left you

lock the front door yes

right and like like our DM confirmed in

the last session we actually completely

renovated stories it was in pristine

order actually the firt the top two

floors are still a blackened charred

mess oh no what happened our house was

additional floors and somebody came in

during that whole endeavor and blew it

up again I walk up and poignant ly on

our king lock the door okay to show my

friends how magic and good I am at

locking the door yeah this this magical

green light sort of forms around it and

then it just sort of opens a little

click yeah and I'm like I'm also like oh

yeah my two stabs are one staff now it

looks cooler and I hold it up yep are

you impressed I'm so impressed

I stole skulls for it let's go inside

when you get inside it's quiet you don't

hear the kids rampaging around make

perception checks NAT one nice thing

that's a seven I'm gonna not use these

[Laughter]

that natural right not natural but my

expertise 21 nice 17 okay immediately

evylyn and death evil in your you're

sort of sensitive to the

of evil and whatnot and you detect none

of that which is good this place feels

feel safe but the the quietness of it is

a little bit jarring to you and you're

instantly wondering where the kids are

about DF your senses immediately go off

that there is some sort of danger or

post danger situation here and that's

when you notice two things with your

phenomenal role one martim Trek the

little kid is perched at the top of the

spiral staircase behind the bars of the

railing looking really nervous like

something bad has just happened and like

he might have a story to share and the

other is he is darting his glance down

toward the floor in the corner where

Stradlin carriage normally resides but

there now is only its rear left leg this

will not stand anyone more puns we done

know we're never done so Jared in your

martim Trek squeaky voice please repeat

after me

daddy I fell immediately got maar times

and just like Martin what happened and

he tells the following story there was a

knock on the front door

[Music]

boy and so a lot of people tried to get

in but they try to get in anyway when

they realized they couldn't get in the

front they went through the unlocked

side door there's a back door there's a

side door and there's a pantry door okay

you didn't lock the side door

Drix

how could you be so careless please

cushion the blow I'm just crying on the

floor like the side door either but then

they went to the side door then they

came in and they grabbed the chair and

broke off one of the legs and took the

rest

chair now they're broken I said no if

you do that they're gonna think it's my

fault somehow it's not my fault cause

you guys did it and then they just left

with the chair and left the leg to make

me look fat please don't think make me

go back down to the dungeon and Simon

recognized some of them because they're

carnies from the sea maidens fair so I'm

inside they came from a ship and so

Simon said that he was going to try to

get the chair back and wanted his

friends to come along on an adventure so

I'm gonna look pretty I want to get that

back because dad needs it and then

squidly is like I'm gonna kill him you

can't do that but then that jinx went to

I stayed here so that you guys wouldn't

know that it wasn't our fault

they took waffles

also waffles is gone circus tricks is

just gonna go get like a pie and just

give it to Martin and just be like you

you you earned this for not leaving the

last thing that the carnie said before

they left Martin was that they said this

the stone for the chair oh come on

is that it well the stone for the chair

like that's that's all we need easy

I mean is it though we don't have either

but we can get the stone can we go we

can get it now evylyn and Strix you guys

after after the debacle of the attack on

the Waffle House last time you flew off

to the castle enter Villa and what you

saw there sort of discouraged you from

proceeding any further without your

friends and that is not only was the

villa heavily guarded as though the

castle enters were expecting trouble to

come and arrive for the stone but their

own guards were bolstered by members of

the city watch and you recall the last

time you went to the castle enter a

state and mess that met the castle

enters in their home they had a captain

of the city watch basically with them

someone that they had on the payroll so

it didn't surprise you but you realize

that could be highly dangerous to

proceed further without knowing how to

deal with these particular City Watchmen

and just the sheer number of guards

present made you think maybe now is not

the time to go storming in there you

know we can't get the stone from there

right now dad could you just as you are

so qualified to do as your chair achter

allows would you please just remind us

all whether or not we need the stone for

other purposes like give us a little

recap of like what we're strategically

supposed to be doing about the stone

supposed to be getting the stone because

the stone itself has some sort of

information or clue or direct guidance

to help us find the location of this

hidden dragon horde a little pile of

gold pieces somewhere within water deep

and I've been trying to I guess acquire

it so that I can repay the dwarfs or

destruction of I

and slag and the loss of many families

exactly but none of that matters now

because now there's real stakes

he took my chair it's can we just they

will see this through bad you need to

drink the cushion the blow thank you we

will win back your chair falton don't

worry thank you I think that it sounds

like the best course of action is to get

the stone and talk to the stone and get

whatever information we needed out of it

and then give it to the people who have

called since chairs so we can get the

trip back exactly where we could just

fight the people with the chair and keep

the stone - because they stole it that's

not our fault actually I think you're

right on this one Eve alone I don't know

if we need the stone itself to find the

Dragon horde but if all the way needs

the information out of it we could get

just the information and then pass the

stone off to whoever we already have a

huge lead thanks for that everyone seems

to want this stone and I just don't I

feel like it's really cramping our

schedule where we're supposed to be

spending time working on our house and

doing self care and people keep trying

to mess with us with this whole stone

situation so a self chair oh thank you

excuse me I misspoke self chair but so I

think that we should you know acquire

and D acquire the stone as fast as

possible I agree and I think another

thing we need to keep in mind is who was

it that sent these these thugs to coming

in to take pulses chair of all things

and leave a leg I know it's very

grotesque I'm pretty sure that leg is a

message like it's only morning well take

your medicine

they're gonna start sending other legs

and envelopes pretty soon no it looks

lutton's Strix you know that the last

time you dealt with the sea maidens fair

was when you got waffles laid yes I

don't call it that

you call it you call it the al bears and

the bees I get it yeah yes so I say that

robbed her bits on another out there and

after they were done rubbing their bits

she looked really happy and we left

mm-hmm

my bird is making microwave noises and

will not know he's he's making bite he

just won't stop that's great so yes so I

know where the ship is and I know I

remember going there I like I know Simon

knows people there which makes sense so

that's probably why he wasn't afraid to

go yeah and that's another thing we can

go after the stone to make the trade but

all the kids went after them oh right

the kids yeah we gotta go get the kids

yeah we gotta go get the kids and the

chair parenting yeah do you think

Charenton

I think we have enough time to say rest

a short amount Walton still looks like

crap yeah Wow are you talking to you

Carlton

I mean his face was crimson mask of

dried blood he walked through the city

looking like this by the way in Poland

just look some of this guy's like geez

rude no I'm strict is right we won't

help out right away we'll just be too

exhausted all right everyone take a

moment clean yourselves up and we'll get

ready to go as soon as we can yeah you

can take a short rest and spend hit dice

to get hit points yeah yeah a short rest

so that uh that way get some natural

healing if you want to get spells back

just just just letting you know that I

can't do any more healing till be long

rest so just just well you still swing

your axe that's good

I mean yeah oh that's true I can do

healing if I hit stuff though

true with my fancy new weapon Thanks

I don't think I guess thing every time

she brings up the weapon she gets so

that it turns into like almost like a

distraction for style song I don't think

I get um spells on a short rest you can

use your sorcery points likely charge

though right

yeah I can use my sorcery I can use my

sorcery points to get more spells later

so that's fine yeah okay

okay so you take a short rest you clean

yourselves up a bit and I don't know how

many hit ties you're spending but you

can keep track of that and roll hit

points don't forget for every hit dye

you use you get that result plus your

con bonus and then how would you like to

proceed to the docks if that's where

you're planning to go that's where you

expect to find the sea maidens fair well

I guess it would be everyone else's all

right with it for the most part I guess

deaath would kind of lead everyone and

using is the city secrets background

feature to kind of use the side streets

and things since the kids themselves are

also street urchins yeah they would

likely be doing the same thing probably

yeah so probably doing that to hopefully

find clues that show that they were

going in the same pathway you you know

squidly being a having been born down by

the docks

supposedly wouldn't know that area I

like the back of his little hand yeah so

yeah not magic on foot through the back

alleys that they could possibly take

would be the best course yeah if you if

you travel down into the doc ward and

then take red cloak Lane to watch run

alley to Nell rooks walk down adder Lane

to picklock alley and along fish Street

just south of fish gut court you'll get

to close enough to the sea maidens fair

the very few people are able to see you

and that's a big bird

he just wants a very quiet I just had to

speak too loud there all right and you

to make your way down on foot I presume

yeah okay except for evil and is

probably fluttering a few feet above the

grip above the the road okay

when you come within sight of the docks

where the ships are and you see the

ships actually from a fair distance away

because you're going downhill heading

toward the water as before there are two

of the vessels that are docked there

essentially on each side of a single

dock that runs between them and then

evil and you know that the flagship of

the sea mains fair is actually anchored

out in the harbor because you were on

that ship that's the one girl axel took

me to correct what was that ship called

again the one out in the bay is called

the eye catcher I catch the two that are

parked or moored are the Hellraiser and

the heartbreaker I catch air if you will

mmm-hmm and when you get down there you

can see that the docks are crowded with

people as well as parked floats and

empty cages and other paraphernalia from

the parade that basically is just

hanging out there and you can see some

some carnies and other dark dock workers

moving around these objects lazily

they're not they don't seem to be in a

rush they don't seem to be getting

prepped for anything they seem to be in

a period of downtime okay that another

worried about them take off anytime do

you think that maybe we should sneak in

instead of just walking in there asking

for things yeah all the boat sails are

down so I mean I mean they that's true

cuz they did say the stone for the chair

and we don't have the stone so this is

more of a just take the chair situation

so probably yet maybe stealth do be a

bit William transporting the chair back

and we have a way of transporting it

with us back if we all hold on to it I

can probably take it with us you also at

least one of you probably has an animate

objects spell oh the child is

Lock itself yeah it's missing a leg okay

slowly you can also I think we can put

it in the bag of holding can we it's too

big to fit in the mouth of the bag of

holding you'd have to smash it to pieces

together okay all right well if it's

considered a Ally maybe we can just take

it with us when I summon us back if you

animate it it becomes a construct and

then it becomes an ally yes so it is so

ridiculous it sure is but we also have

to take well waffles can I can cloud

waffles and put waffles and did a jar so

then waffles is part of me so that

should work just fine but we'll have to

go in quietly if we're taking this back

but the thing is it's very strange that

these people told us they wanted the

stone but then didn't tell us how to

find them or where they were anything

like that I don't even know where to

start I suppose we should try finding

one of the kids oh that was gonna be my

next question and which one of these

ships they go to we didn't see any clues

as to that right Christmas

how much do you doodlee doodlee do

what's like the general range of like

these ships like how far apart is our

own so the two ships that are docked are

each of these ships is let's see it's

about about each ship is about 30 feet

wide by about 90 feet long and these two

ships have a gap between them of about

30 feet No okay the other ship is

hundreds of yards out in the bay I mean

first thing can we just listen for

squigglies voice and see if he's

shouting something anywhere there's too

much ambient noise at the docks people

seagulls

just shuffling I mean has a very

piercing little voice I just does but

even that even then you wouldn't hear it

you'd have to get much much closer to

the scene if they're anywhere near where

all the dock workers and

carnival folks are milling around well

if you guys like I can locate Ferdinand

oh yeah yeah locate Ferdinand and then I

was thinking if we need to do some

scouting I could go in as a rat

considering rats are very common on

ships it wouldn't I would no one would

notice me yeah I was also just gonna

locate creatures Simon I do both they

might be in different places it may not

be a bad idea to do all the above well

why don't you try first and I'll try

second you try with Simon sure is

do I feel Simon within a thousand feet

of me all right

casting it where you are you can

definitely encompass the docks and both

ships that are moored you do not detect

Simon's presence on either of the two

ships or around all the the crowd at the

docks well then he's not on those so how

would the kids have gotten onto any

ships that were not moored but I guess I

should go check the other ships huh

paltin encompass to the two ships that

are moored at the docks in his spell and

he's pretty sure Simon's not there can I

also say thank you for locating object

on Ferdinand not the chair I appreciate

that did you want to use your locate

object and then well I was thinking if

paltin couldn't find Simon is there

another area that I could try like do I

think they they could be out on the

other boat so I should like fly over

there and see the only area so the sea

maidens fair is gathered around these

two boats that are tethered at the docks

the only other place where you see any

sea maidens fair activity is out on the

one in the harbor out of the range of

Paulding spell so I'm I'm gonna fly over

the two ships and still like overlap

those two just in case but I'm also

going to encompass the one that's more

doubt because I assume I can do that in

a thousand feet right the two ships and

the third ship are not within a thousand

feet of each other you'll have to cast

the spell

encompass the two ships and then move

out with the spell to get the third oh

can I do that

can I just like I'm about to find out

let's see I can read it to ya you

totally can

Oh so I'll just I'll do it within a

thousand feet and then I'll all over and

scan spells within a thousand feet of

you but you can move around and so the

field moves with you okay so I'll start

it where we're both that and scan the

same area as paltin and you're scanning

for Ferdinand mm-hmm okay you detect

Ferdinand immediately where Ferdinand is

aboard one of the ships that is docked

here at the pier Ferdinand is which one

hellraiser heartbreaker

it is docked in the heart breaker all of

us to the heart breaker cuz Ferdinand is

in there which means the kids are in

there not sign on him it's not why would

Ferdinand be there but if you didn't

send Simon

something's something there's probably

just some cloaking spell or something

going on

well yeah HIO locate one of the kids yes

I think it'd be if Ferdinand is there

well could you try to locate Jenks yeah

because one he got separated sure I'll

try to locate Jenks so you're gonna cast

the spell again mm-hmm all right you do

not detect Jenks in the field of the two

ships or the docks so Jenks is not with

Ferdinand for tonight Ferdinand's on

there I don't think the kids are it

takes a lot to separate Jenks from

Ferdinand sure does can I I still have

my spell can I move now yes yeah well

actually I was looking for Ferdinand so

never mind that would not well true yeah

you found him but there's one ship out

in the harbor that need that me

Simon neither evylyn nor paltin have got

a read on yet

okay well look we got a look at that one

do you want to check it Paulson and I'll

hand him my broom whoo

yeah turn my staff in my room and say

but don't don't get close enough for

them to see you I know it's it's varied

I you know it's really a dumb question

I know I don't know where he's online

all right so he takes off into the sky

there's a huge backfire that John's eyes

up in that general direction and then

palton rockets up with a big black cloud

trailing behind him into the sky hmm

Paul never remember it being this fast I

yell like is it faster than before with

the skulls at it it's just like what

just like flying by like it big black

cloud streaming behind you

I think it's spell your name in the sky

if you want yes it just looks like an ad

campaign for his musical tour is it like

is it like nice cursive or is it well I

was just going to have you make a let's

make a call it a dexterity check to

spell your name in the sky because it's

actually probably a lot harder than it

seems

writing is mainly three dimensions

maybe nothing like acrobatically or

performance I would say acrobatics would

apply okay this was a stealth mission

again well that's a 24 oh hey you it's

always good to remember that you mouth

teeth I and and the dot on the top of

the eye yeah and the dot is a little

lightning bolt

as this is all happening in DHS standing

there next to Strix and evil and just

like time is of the essence this is so

fun

meanwhile out out in the harbor a crew

of the eye catcher looks out into the

sky and says I think they're on their

way

[Laughter]

and then you rock it out over the water

everybody on the dock is now looking up

at this fellow on this broom just giving

a I take it snap Alton cepa's next show

on the drunk and dying tour or the ashes

to ashes tour round of course are you

swooping down to the eye catcher cuz it

is this big ship out anchored out in the

middle of the harbor when you get close

to it you see it's colorful it's

bedecked with all sorts of beautiful

unlit lanterns there our crew members on

the deck some of them looking up at you

with spy glasses some of them just

holding their hand up to block the Sun

am i okay can I get close enough to

where I can locate one more time yeah

right you wouldn't have broken the

concentration yeah you could still have

it I guess oh cool yeah all right

spelling out his name being attacked at

this point I was gonna clearly don't

mind me all right when you rock it past

you do detect Simon aboard the ship cool

kind of as you get your bearings

something doesn't make sense to you

he must either be very deep down in the

ship or underneath it can I try and dive

into the water with the broom no my

promise when you hit the water just make

a let's call it a strength saving throw

okay okay

all right so does a Ford okay

so you come down you sort of do this

little loop de loop and just go straight

into the water yeah this little and then

gone when you hit the water you are so

shocked at the force with which you hit

the water that the broom sort of jets

out of your grasp and you find yourself

just floating on the water least like

just like treading like looking around

like oh do I see the broom anywhere

nope I need that under the water it

floats it's would make a perception

check okey-dokey

why you don't learn your friends your

car he was just supposed to check the

rest of you just saw what appeared like

palton crashing into the bay damn it

okay kind of behind the ship I just

loudly just curse by this time his name

is going to dissolve in the sky above

you fifteen you look around the water

you don't see anything oh fifteen as

you're gazing down into the water you

can see the lights of some sort of

submersible vessel that's attached to

the underside of this ship even didn't

tell death all about this in front of

paltin I don't know if he remembers but

paltin this is the first time you've

heard about this ship okay cool so

that's actually true or not the Strix is

gonna polymorph herself into a seal okay

what what is a gap and evylyn doing in

reaction to paltin crash landing into

the bay evil maybe you should go help

them Spriggs can't you Pauly more Diaz

into something I can

Carrie and I can care about oh I'm

already a seal also dia has indicated he

doesn't like being polymorphed so oh

wait here okay it is at this time paltin

that you see that when you surface to

get a gulp of air the broom is kind of

floating on the water about seven feet

away from you okay and then a

life-preserver lens on the water next to

you with a rope attached to it and you

see some crewmen on the ship asking if

you'd like to be rescued yeah let me

grab my broom real quick please doing

grab you're far too far and Holly to be

heard in your zeal all right so you grab

the broom and you grab the life

preserver and they start to reel you up

great meanwhile evylyn you're flying out

I'm sorry what are you doing chillin at

the dock with the sail being the only

character that still can't fly yeah do

you find a boat at least like a dinghy a

ding dong ding ding dong ding oh dear

all right evylyn you flutter out

attracting some attention with your

gleaming armor and your scintillating

axe and your winged boots etc and so

forth but you head out toward the ship

and your eyes are good enough to see

even without a perception check paltin

being hauled out of the water by a rope

by the crew of the eye-catcher and

brought up onto the deck of the ship

well that's so nice of them Paulding yes

um one of the crew members tries to take

the broom from you I mean I knew

it

okay that's that's why that's why we're

here make eggs make a strength check Wow

okay

come on 14 okay has no problem you can

see the one who took the broom from you

is this really powerfully built like

circus strongmen oh my god with a

handlebar moustache this is even though

I'm gonna tell them be like that broom

is why I'm here I'm actually a broom

merchant and I'm here to talk to your

captain as you are turning to him to try

to explain this to him a tap on your

shoulder takes your attention in another

direction and you look over and you see

what appears to be a mechanical man

dressed like a swashbuckler with a hat

with a feather but he's about as tall as

you are a very slender and you can hear

whirring gears inside of his mechanical

body but he's basically dressed like a

swordsman like a dashing swordsman ah I

say I see the robot overthrow has

already begun and he takes off his hat

and bow before you and gestures you

toward what appears to be the aft cabin

I gave him like a and you can see the

strongman holds the broom and then tries

to break it doesn't want to bend it

doesn't even be careful that's worth

more than what you make in a year

just so you know when you break it it

explodes it's I was actually gonna say

that as a as a deception but uh oh no

it's true okay well yeah don't do that

please God please don't do that

evylyn you're flying overhead and you

see paltin on the deck and you see all

this transpire if I see the strongman

take the broom she's gonna do a cute

little Starling dive and try to just

like swoop the broom out of his hands

sort of by surprise yeah that's not

yours you ain't go ahead and make a

strength Jack he's kind of holding it

out as if to try to break it now he's

kind of using the back of his neck to

try to snap it but no

straights is gonna have to have a long

long conversation too with everyone

about staff safety why do I see

beforehand that she's like kind of

coming here and the strongman doesn't

see her coming at all could I like

Bartok inspo and like whistle a little

tune mm-hmm you sure cool I do that so I

had a d-10 oh nice I can use that

oh my rolls are rubbed bad today I only

wrote a one on that d-10 great that

gives it gives me 14 okay

I have advantage cuz he's holding it all

weird no but even with your 14 he rolled

bad enough that you're able to snatch

the broom from his grasp

you shouldn't yours thank you and

continue on your flight mm-hmm this

feels like okay so to this uh where was

I going again the dashing clockwork

swordsman was trying to direct you to

the aft cabin which drama you're sort of

on the aft castles or so you're on the

forecastle so it's kind of at the other

end of the ship can even go drop off the

broom with the seal like offer it to

that one sometime see ya huh that will

take a few minutes okay okay

so you see Paulding evilman leaves with

the broom cool well bye I guess I I

didn't think she was that far away

you're you're hundreds of yards away

from the shore I'll just hang out like

just flying in the air hang out yeah

okay yep all right the crew watches you

as you just suspend in the air there but

they don't they don't do anything

threatening to evylyn but you do see

this swordsman and some of the crew

members leading palton down the

forecastle of the ship across the main

deck and into the back of the ship which

you know from experience having been on

the ship before is Jarl Axl's dining

room slash parlor where he courted you

briefly

before seeing you to his bedchamber and

Pelton's going there willingly yeah

piers he doesn't seem to be under any

duress he's under escort but they're not

grabbing him or anything and well that's

going on dia and Strix from your vantage

point it's very hard to see what's going

on aboard the ship you see evil and just

hovering in the air with the broom but

she's I think she's a tiny little speck

I'm just like flailing as a seal like

please there's no way there's no way you

can yeah you're sort of flopping along

with your your say your seal flippers on

the on the docks

I guess DF with you okay I'm just on the

okay I just like look at dance and I'm

just like there's shrug and I turn back

into myself we know that once you get in

the water he'll be much faster and can

probably get there and make good time

that's true I just like but Dave needs a

way to get over well they're in trouble

and they need help the need as fast as

possible if you can go and get there as

fast as you can I'll catch up tonight

are you sure like I could have

polymarker you sure you don't want

probably worked just I'm making seal

eyes we might need your spell's do you

want to come with me see you lies leg

some people walk past you as you're

talking and CG out having a conversation

with a seal and the seals talking and

they say they look at the bottles of

mead that they're holding and one of

them just sort of throws it in the water

I am going to turn the earth into a seal

as well all right

didn't have to long time to go like are

you resisting at all yeah make a saving

throw is why are we so dysfunctional

what's the saving throw Holly watch your

DC 16 and it is a wisdom

right that that's got it fine I got a 15

I'm sorry it's 17 so oh well then okay

so an unwilling seal thou art yes well

there's now a very upset seal on the

dock I'll jump in the water and expect

to follow okay dad

dear slap his way for Platt anyone knows

why we're making these noises and

thinking they're so delightful subtitled

seal video totally worth it yeah anyway

you'll be you'll be delighted

okay so the two of you were in the water

and racing toward the eye catcher

evylyn is perched in the air above the

eye catcher palton disappears inside

pulposus Bolton's going inside evylyn

will land and be like what's that all

right

are you trying to get to palton you just

landing on the deck yeah I'm trying to

be back up for paltin so as soon as I

see him about to go and reload the land

the crew does not get in your way as you

make your way toward paulten but paulten

you have a minute you have a couple

seconds basically when you enter this

chamber to see that Jarl axel is seated

comfortably behind a dining table he is

eating a slice of peach and you can see

that the table is arrayed with all sorts

of delicious foodstuffs so do I see him

too because the back windows all the

drapes are drawn so that you can see a

beautiful view of the city so there's

Jarrell Axl and so like the doors open

so it was open is evylyn in hearing

distance of me you hear her land on the

deck Kadamba and you can see her coming

in behind you the only other person with

you in the room who enters the room is

the clockwork swordsman and when the

clockwork swordsman enters he kind of

it's stay

in a corner boughs before Carl Axl and

just silently introduces you I turn

around I see evil and Lynn I'm just like

no I will not make out with you and Joel

axel says oh please that's all over with

we are done playing nice with one

another

I want this stone and then I will return

to you what is yours no more negotiation

do you have the stone

what are you what why why is everyone

got such a hard-on for this stone like

his will be 500 thousand gold pieces

have you thought about what that'll do

to the economy this is all money that

was stolen from the economy we all just

yeah putting the money back where it

belongs at least that is my intention I

do not need the money do I look like I

need half a million gold pieces

no okay interests are purely charitable

aha I'm sorry that you cannot see that

do I do I believe that evil and you walk

in he stands job black so I'm so glad

you're here we're so we just kill walk

over to walk over and take your hand and

he says the Sun pales to you he stole

the chair and the kids

he wouldn't do I'm sure there's some

food that I took your chair and I will

give it back once I get this done the

kids they came of their own accord and I

relax like can't just take people's

chairs you'd be surprised what I can do

my life

what like a surprise to fact what I can

do well I don't think that was the right

thing to do and I don't think Lysander I

have not interested in the right thing

to do

why not it's all time palton is just

like watching evil and just like

listening I am interested in doing what

is best for all consumed me Mississippi

why is taking the chair the best thing

because it gets me what I want what I

should have had at the auction until you

deprived me of that i deprived you they

were your friends

I don't see it that way but the thing is

jaw relaxed oh we don't have the stone

so you're kind of barking up the wrong

tree there way to kind of I just I'm so

confused because I thought that you were

really you know looking to walk down the

path of Lysander oh my god he's lying

why would you believe him huh why would

you believe him about what about this

guy clearly will say or do whatever what

it takes to get what he wants I love

life and out

seek but do you think Lathon Dell would

want the stones women in the hands of

those evil devil worshiping Castle

entails

no no they must be arrested of that

stone before they can use the money for

their own corrupt purposes that's

probably true

evylyn like having a really she's

looking between paulson and daryl axel

and I trust the Zen time to recover that

gold and deliver it to the dwarves as

they have committed to doing no they

won't do that the shadow organization

bent on world domination why don't you

go get it from the castle Anders why'd

you have to steal part because I don't

have to because I have you my dear and

your friends I'm more than capable of

dealing with the castle antle's I

understand that you want great terms

with them perhaps they were paths with

the stone willingly

oh so you love Lysander and you just you

you believe in evil in and all of us

when you need some I believe in all of

you oh okay even then especially so

basically we are even involving you and

don't want to do something is that it

even kind of like if you had been nice

up to me we wouldn't be in this position

at all did you bring it you see that

even kind of is like looking down and

she gets really quiet and she's like uh

I should have known she looks up at your

axle and she's like I I guess it was

silly of me to think that you actually

wanted to spend any time getting to know

me or or talking about even just talking

about Lysander I get it it's you want me

to do something for you because that's

I mean let's be honest that's what

everybody wants right and that is known

better yes you should have

yeah well where where is the chair and

where's my son

the Chavez in a safe place and you don't

have a son excuse me

except of course Lathon Dao the one true

son you're gonna want to try that one

again

my son Simon where is he as I said he is

not your son just some question little

brat that you come from a puppet even

can't help herself and she just like

smacks him with the flat of her

battle-ax let's cross the head he lets

you Oh

the stone your muted even turns away and

goes marching into the belly of the ship

you won't find it down there but look as

you will and he he's now alone with you

paltin and he says you and me we are not

finished is there like a chair in here

barely many chairs in here

he just keeps eye contact and like pulls

one up and just sits I got time time is

running out my friend so we're not

finished but we're out of time sending

mixed signals here and I feel like

that's kind of a theme you got going on

we have all your other two friends at

this point the seals start to our make

their way over to the ship are your two

friends in the distance you go sir all

right I would like DF and Strix to make

perception checks please great so I have

a question about my perception yeah how

does it change especially my expertise

as a seal

you still have your your perception

skills okay I'll just go from the same

it's not only it I've got the seal

skills but for I'm gonna assume you just

have your own you're very perceptive

seal

I got a 13 okay 24 all right you can see

that as you've been swimming across the

DF that there is a shark on an intercept

course with you you see panic in death

but you don't understand why there's

gotta be a universal seal sound I mean

he looks panicked I will I will

turn us back into people oh great so you

because I want to know what's happening

you end the spell and so you're both now

swimming in the water and I'm just like

what what and and that's Strix when you

see this shark's fin circling around you

know now I don't know and as the shark

closes in there is a shimmer of metallic

scales and then this big dragon mouth

comes up eats the shark disappears down

into the water do these scales look

familiar at all you've caught you've

caught glimpses of them in the past and

then you see this big dragon tail come

out and then go back down under the

water I stick my head in the water and I

go thank you

I'll call are we are we from the ship at

this point not far about 40 feet

the ship is looming a large before you

all right the dragon likes us no I think

he's hungry we need to go but they're

nice it's a shiny drying which means the

nice dragon we don't know anything about

that you remember ZF evil and telling

you about the submarine under this ship

oh I do remember that we need to find a

way into there I have an idea as DF

light turns to go to this rip it goes

wait hold on and then he'll like steel

down underwater for you some moment

stretch he dives below the what into the

dark water yeah yeah and just try to

look around and see if there's anything

there when you appear in the water you

can see in fact lights coming out from

the inside of a manta ray shaped

submersible attached to the underside of

this big ship just as evil and describe

it I have an idea what as clouds we

don't need to breathe underwater

he can get through tiny crevices so why

don't we go under what's top

why don't we go underwater as clouds and

then we can get in through it through

like a vent or a you know some sort of

like fan or I don't know what it's a

thing it's a machine we there's gotta be

holes and then we unclouded steal it uh

did we hear it take it to be here that

Simon was like potentially underneath a

ship or within the bowels of it no okay

Paul probably like surmise since we got

on the ship that we found something

there yeah on the ship yeah he got on

the ship it didn't go underwater right

although palton crashed into the water

but he got fished out so if I if Paulson

went in the water like that it actually

looked like he crashed oh yeah I don't

know it's pretty far I feel like it'd be

he looked really cool I'm sure I just

think if we go down under there will be

at least a little bit more stuffy than

palton writing his name in the sky I'm

like screaming I also don't have my

staff which is very unfortunate right

now so I would like to at least have

some sort of advantage and maybe

stealing whatever that is will help us

at least have a bargaining chip

marketing chip yes tricks you're right

all right I think if you can cloud us

and we can very awkwardly slowly cloud

our way down into there let's do that

well let's do it then so I will cloud

you first poof and then I will cloud

myself I have to look this up this is

such a weird situation I mean can a gas

cloud go through your head

they're basically carbonating water kind

of yeah it says you can pass through

small holes in our openings even small

cracks it treat though it treats liquids

as though they were solid surfaces spell

actually says no you would know this

tricks oh well we can you would just

sort of bubble up to the surface tricks

do you still know dimensioned or do i I

do not damn it

I know um pass wall though so we can

make a door in anything I got my snack I

saw Chris smiling before I realize don't

mean I Victrola fit in the water

throwing a fit currently evil I'm has

your stuff yes Strix

how does misty step work do you go

through objects so you just have to see

wait we can't we have to see it yeah

your are windows there are windows so

yes we could misty step you can misty

stuff we can both missed Easter yes yes

all right you just have to see where

you're misty stepping to it could get

pretty deep into there though I'm gonna

be able to swim the weight your way down

I mean submarines about 30 feet down

well we'll stay together just hold onto

my robe or something well just stay

close will swim together

evylyn said there's some sort of windows

or something you can find those and then

we can mr. C type our way inside the

ship and if this thing is connected to

it they must have like a loading dock or

something from like the actual ship

itself we can actually start from the

bottom and make our way up that makes

sense

maybe maybe if we miss you step together

I can hold your hand let me go together

yes right I'm smart today ideas will

like takes tricks is hand yeah right

count of three we're swimming under

ready alright three two one

[Music]

all right we're sweating you start to

swim down I would like both of you to

make Constitution checks all right you

took enough breath to get down there I

know I asked if you could swim down

there the secret is da chosen oh wow

because it takes it takes a bit of time

for unpracticed swimmers do I owe

Constitution saving through no just the

check

oh well for all pense burgers the same

thing yeah oh my Jean okay no problem

evylyn we'll be right with you hold on

wait hold on damn it

wait Constitution okay

I used my divine dice okay holding each

other's hands you have no problem you

get a big gulp of breath you go down

there and you're able to make your way

down to the submarines level you can see

that the submarine has small portholes

along its flanks and then big windows at

the front one on either side that kind

of look like eyes big round windows too

obviously somewhere important at the

front of the ship so you can either go

to a small portal and try to get in

through there or you can swim up to that

one of the big windows and appear there

instead your choice probably a porthole

that'd be it's probably the least

obvious or most innocuous way of getting

up to the yeah and that would put you on

one of the wings of the of the Ray

evylyn as you make your way outside of

the dining room back onto the deck crew

members observe you but they don't get

in your way some of them actually get

out of your way as you move with purpose

what I assume is down into the bowels of

the ship yes okay with purpose and very

miffed okay when you go below decks

and you get into the hold of the eye

catcher you can see that this hold is

full of a lot completely there's there's

ample room to move around you can see

that there are a bunch of float

decorations kind of placed about and

including some broken clockwork

contraptions there is some waggon covers

lying around some oversized puppets that

look like they're meant to be mounted to

the tops of floats there is a deflated

balloon that looks like some sort of

creature although it's hard to make out

what it is in its deflated State and you

can see an undecorated float topped with

an unpainted mechanical gold dragon made

of canvas stretched over a wooden frame

you can also see what appear to be in

the various corners of the room some

stuffed painted colorful spiders almost

like giant pinatas just sort of lying

about but as you make your way down

through the hold in an attempt to cross

the hole to reach even lower levels you

see that those giant spiders begin to

move I'm in no mood they come creeping

out toward you and they're all painted

very brightly but they are actually

living giant spiders she she tries to

intimidate them by saying I am in no

mood with mom face I'll go ahead and

make an intimidate intimidation wrong

it's an okay roll initiative all 13 okay

they are clearly attempting to attack

you but you get the jump on them what do

you do there they're obviously hostile

they are not taking your attempts at

intimidation seriously at all they're

coming at me in what kind of formation

they you're in the middle of the hold

and they're coming at you

from the corners so you're basically

instantly surrounded by them so they're

kind of in like a semicircle kind of

situation there's there's two in front

of you and two behind you at angles okay

um and you'd have to get through at

least two of them to get to the next

level down I am look sorry I'm looking

up the range area of ensnaring strike

Jarl axel says to paltin oh do I think I

forgot to mention to how that buy old is

full of giant spiders she'll be all

right I'm sure she'll be fine

all right so even yellow then he'll just

he'll sit back in another chair across

from you and hand you a pair I'm Julie

all right it takes is just like what

kind of deranged sociopath just eats

pears he says it's very rare pals I got

them from a milk and an almond oh you

assume I know what that is

evylyn go ahead in keeping with her I am

in no mood situation even is just gonna

try to continue marching forward and

whatever one gets in her way first is

just gonna get the battle ax okay go

ahead make your attack role because

you're gonna have to fight through them

first attack is a 28 that definitely

hits and I'm using this new fancy

schmancy to do I have to read it every

time because I still don't have it in

mind sorry okay it and she's using it

two handed so that's D ten plus four

damage

so 13 plus the improved minds defined

smite which is 19 and these are not

fiends are Undead

correct so 19 and also since I'm dealing

divine damage I'm gonna go ahead and let

it heal me my one d-10 is that okay sure

cool she just just for good riddance

like I'll take that mm-hmm heals 9 ok

these spiders will then attack you one

of them like I I get a second attack oh

I'm sorry right go ahead same spider

yeah that one's a 28 wait no 25 and that

one does Oh 5 plus 6 so 11 damage okay

that kills that spider there are three

left one of them spurts a web at you out

of its derriere it has to make an attack

roll it rolled it 22 to hit your armor

class that does hit okay you are

restrained by webbing basically fastened

to the floor and you believe it is an

action to try to break out of this on

your next turn if you so wish the other

two then come over to you an attempt to

bite you

they have advantage because you're

restrained one of them hits you actually

they both do and you will take a 11

points of damage from one and 10 points

of damage from the other so 21 total but

I also now need you to make to

Constitution saving thrust the first con

is it saving ya first is 20 okay and

second is 27 you succeed on both so you

take half of the poison damage as it

courses through you for another 8 total

so you took a total of 29 from that

experience

you are affixed to the floor and it

doesn't even have a resistance to poison

you tell me I will look the tag-team of

Strix and DF holding hands you come to a

portal since you're probably just

approaching one randomly I'll just

determine randomly which portal yeah you

come at it she doesn't that was from her

conne storm she just is can't have

she has protection from disease now

right all right you look through peer

through the window you can see a cabin a

metal walled metal floor a grilled

floored cabin which has a net hammock

hanging along one wall a footlocker

there seems to be some sort of small

shrine in a corner that has a tiny

spider statuette in it and a closet that

has a weird contraption that I'm just

going to tell you it looks like a diving

suit and then it sits just sort of

hanging in a closet cavity and you can

also see in this room bound and gagged

are NAT and squiggly they're tied with

rope okay yep alright so as soon as we

get to their death will unsheathed moon

splinter underwater I guess just hold on

to the handle from the belt cheese

mm-hmm I mean look over reg tricks to

make sure she's ready to get in there

she's like alright yeah then death will

take the moment to concentrate in Missy

step I guess completely drenched I'll

try and do it at the same time so like

super cool so like Ghia theater eyes but

his hair is just like clean yeah you

appear in misty step form in the middle

of this room surprising the kids you can

see that is not gagged but squiggly is

[Laughter]

no drinks no Simon okay muffled starts

is still holding Deus a.m. but as soon

as she sees squiggly looking at them

she's good so before the ungag squiggly

death is actually going to look over at

net and you Steve's cants whispering a

little bit of kinky sign that yes can do

to kind of like ask her you know what

happened how many are there

etc net you are able to tell him that in

short when waffle when you and the rest

of the crew got here to the docks with

waffles waffles kind of lost it a little

bit and went charging toward one of the

ships up the gangplank and started to

make a scene at which point the kids

basically lost their plan fell apart and

they don't know why Jenks dropped

Ferdinand in the water by mistake and

then several crew members managed to

grab hold of them and use what appeared

to be hand crossbows to tranquilize

waffles before she hurt anybody and then

the kids were taken by dinghy over to

this ship where they were interrogated

by a rather under clad man with a floppy

hat and a beard before they were taken

down below into this strange vessel by

by drow I want to know how NAT signs the

word under clad use exactly that word

because she wants to be proper yet yes

because the kids seem to draw a lot of

strength from each other they were

separated into two separate cabins with

Simon and Jenks put in one and squidly

and not put in the other although

they're all down here

well I'm also gonna can I do you don't

know where the chair is

sorry I just want to do a quick religion

check on that that spider statue or is

it very obvious that it's like a loss

it's a loss that's you know okay I'm

just gonna immediately just pick it up

and just break it you can just smash it

on the floor it breaks in time make that

much noise oh I see that's here

methodically just sort of breaking off

its legs I just break off this little

spider legs one by one and like I said

put it back alright and I'm just like I

don't like your I mean I don't like you

and anyway so we need to stay quiet

but sodium would be like unbinding them

at this point

nat first well first i can tell you that

there are drow they saw drow brought

them down but they don't know what

happened after they were locked in the

room or whether the drow are still here

or not they also saw what looked like a

very short little tiny person like a

gnome or a halfling Sirk's is also gonna

look at squiggly before we on take

squigglies gag off and it's like

squiggly mmm-hmm

your mom is telling you to be quiet

please be quiet if we take this gag off

of you you need to not be loud do you

promise me you can call me mom all you

want alright and if you talk you won't

get any more pies okay so i slowly take

the gag off i'm like squiggly just kind

of that for the rest of the adventure ur

got it great works by the way not

squiggly you have your weapons because

nobody aboard the eye catcher considered

them threatening great good thing they

didn't find my dagger not nice

they didn't even search you alright

final question for you - they brought

you onto the ship is there another way

out of it out of this thing they go to

you can you know you can tell them that

big you were brought down through a

hatch in the ceiling and you know that

if you were to leave this room out

through this metal door and go to the

right you would eventually get back to

the hatch

all right women just steal it though

we're gonna steal it if you go to the

left when you step out the door you'll

be in what you believe to be some sort

of command center yeah that's tricks you

know this this submarine it's not tiny

there are multiple rooms inside it but

when you step out through that door it's

gonna be you think just probably harder

not to be seen by those on board the

ship there's not so much space in here

that people won't hear you clomping

around or even feel the movement on the

deck yeah if there's a lot of people on

here we may not be able to easily

quietly successfully just take this well

if we I have an idea if we cloud

ourselves again and get into the command

center and then lock the doors and then

just drive it away we're just gonna

drive it away when I when there's a

second can I talk to Jarrell axel you

could do that right now yeah drive it

away while strix and death are plotting

so I just weird so if we've we've just

kind of been sitting in silence for like

a couple minutes just like staring down

as I'm holding this pair maybe well yeah

when you put it down he says would you

prefer a different food no I'm I'm good

so you want this stone I do very much

yes I want this stone and stone for the

chair is the deal yes today that I

slowed before did I start hell perhaps

well your accents really weird

what is causing you problems here to

have a simple transaction so then we're

clear to just take the kids and leave

and go back to retrieving the stone for

you correct

I never expected to all the kids but

since they came here willingly I feel

the necessity to protect them while you

run off and antagonize the castle

anthills who knows what they'll do

next they're clearly not fit to be in

your possession well we do have a

babysitter for that exact situation

today we what do we I'm not aware of you

entrusting these kids to anyone

trustworthy believe me they'll be safer

here in my care how about you just let

the kids go with us you seem that you

seem to not get something very important

here this is not a negotiation I have

what I want now I want this stone you

give it to me and then I will release

the children into your unwell they care

and also give you back your ridiculous

chair okay which I know that you

treasure above all adults including

evylyn believe me I saw it in your eye

the first time you threw me out of it

so Kris above game how big would you say

this ship is it's about 30 feet wide and

about 90 to 120 feet long okay

would that be classified as huge know

they would be classified as gargantuan

and not a single object of course it is

well all right hold on I have a

different cutscene so you just kind of

draw Axl says that won't work I did I

didn't try anything not sure what you

were gonna say what you thought I was

gonna do didn't try anything I know

exactly what they like to do mm-hmm

there's kind of stands up goes all right

we got your stupid stone

I'm gonna go retrieve my friend OHS

thank you so easy carry on

and he kind of picks up the peach and

then just pockets it walks out as you

walk out the clockwork swordsman just

sort of bow before you please just let

us live I know the AI takeover is

inevitable but I'm pretty sure that if

you just watch we will this sort of

looks past you over to jail excellent

back to you the humans will ruin the

earth before you even need to do

anything we'll do it ourselves

good day that was a gift from our lanta

knees wizard acquaintance of mine who

and then you realize he's you've left

mm-hmm just walking out in mid sir last

thing your jaw locks will say to the

clockwork man is I'm gonna even let my

way down I get it that I bet you are

evylyn after being bitten by two spiders

these nasty nasty fangs sinking into

your flesh what do you do on your next

turn you are pinned between them I am

going evil ins like she she's just

annoyed by these she's not afraid she's

barely slowed down she's just like huh

really you know um can she misty step

out of that web if she has misty steps

she can certainly misty step out of the

web she just sighs and rolls her eyes

and misty steps the web just sort of

collapses where she used to be and you

can go past the spiders to the stairs to

the next level if you want that's what

she wants to do and you continue on down

all right

the spiders do not pursue you to the

next lower level well because they've

been trained to stay the hell out of

there

when you come down to that level of the

ship things kind of look a little bit

familiar to you maybe you were a little

tipsy the last time he came down here

after jaw relaxed oh if I do that

wonderful wine but you're pretty sure

his cabin is on this level you're on the

bottom level of the ship

this point but you can't remember if

it's the door on the left or the door on

the right

there's also you can go deeper into the

lower hold here if you want to she'll

try the right door okay you've come down

okay yeah when you come down into this

room what did you see what you see yeah

oh yeah this is his cabin all right

and when you open the door

a magical mouse appears on the door

itself and says in a French accent by

lost teeth have you known man else and

it's it's fairly loud but you look

around and it doesn't seem to attract

any attention and then you smell the

sweet smell of lavender pouring out of

the cabin and when you step inside you

can see that there's a chess table a

dragon chess table in fact an empty wine

bottle on the table and with a fancy

label and there is a purple curtain that

has been sort of peeled back and you can

see the Jarl Axl's bed too covered with

a soft blue blanket and matching pillows

and a wooden chest with clawed feet

she'll open the chest alright dude you

can see that

it is locked well the kids might be in

here I better check pops it with their

battle axe

halten when you come down the stairs you

can see that there is a hold full of

paraphernalia for the sea maidens fair

and three giant spiders creeping about a

fourth one lying dead amid some sticky

webs on the floor it's clear evylyn came

through here murdered one of the spiders

and somehow eluded the other three but

they turn and glare at you with their

twenty four eyes as you come down the

stairs

can i it doesn't feel like they're not

like totally like savage like kill

everything spiders do they say you look

pretty mean yeah but I mean does it seem

like our new reid is hostility was the

moral ambiguity of murdering spiders

it's more I'm just gonna like I'm just

gonna like start to walk through while

keeping an eye on them just like not

seeming aggressive or hostile just like

I'm going in there alright they attack

you huh

I was I was also going to try an

intimidation great let's see how fast

you can do that roll initiative okay all

right

seventeen all right you do in fact can

you can try something before they pounce

on you intimidation you say yeah I'm

gonna whoa what should I do for flavor I

just kind of like like getting kind of

like a little thunder wave ready just

like hold up a hand and have some like

sparks just kind of sparking off of it

just to be like don't do that go ahead

and make your check all right that is

17 well far be it for the spiders to

come between you and true love

they kind of back up into the shadows

like sit her back and forth each other

yeah and they clear a path for you say

I'll take it I'll just keep walking here

and you sort of keep an eye on the

michigo and then you have to bump into

this float of this big gold dragon and

then you carry on around it I mean they

are ship spiders no all right and then

as you as you head down the next flight

of stairs palton you hear this smashing

sound of what sounds like an ax

hammering into wood and when you appear

in through the open doorway into Jarl

Axl's boudoir bedchamber you see evylyn

has cut a chest in half and shattered

all the potions within Oh would you

bleed out all over the floor oops

there's also obviously if what appeared

to be a flask of perfume there that's

now filling the room with a very strong

scent of odisha lakhs yeah smells like

ass and try hard in here geez I need to

look inside this pillow will you hold

this corner of it really tight please

just hold the corner of this pillow

really tight okay whoops she rips it in

half from his graceful beautiful gold

feathers rained down upon the bed

whoopsie how could I be so careless

I thought maybe Simon my son was inside

that pillow looks at the chest and looks

at the pillars like

yes you want to look inside the mattress

I feel like there's more going on here

that just wondering if you personally

might feel any desire to look inside

anything in Jarl Axl's room there's this

thirst of all nightstands on each side

of the bed with candles candelabra

beautiful elegant candelabra kind of

shaped beautiful web the patterns

fighter patterns you know as the paladin

of the city ad I have what amounts to a

search warrant when I have probable

cause so I'm gonna start early eggs the

axe through the mattress carving this

big - down the middle of it from one end

to the other

hmm looks like nothing in here stuffing

billows out but no Simon listen okay I'm

scent of perfume becomes even more

intense you see it seems to enrage her a

little bit more hmm what could be inside

these nightstands she picks one up and

dumps it out okay palton you've got one

next to you as well

Drake you just kind of like looks and

just kind of just knocks it over nicely

down one of the the drawer that you

knock over paltin opens and you see a a

bow tied lock of evil ins hair come

tumbling out the hole that's

gross dude eat one looks at it and she

goes I did not give him that so

yeah he's not great you think hmm yeah

there's also a small little note in

there that looks like it was the note

evylyn you left just basically before

you took off saying bye that's in there

too I think we should leave now and go

find our son mmm Bolton you find this

note written in evil insane Oh clearly

she was here before I think I told them

that deny nope you know what I'm not

gonna ask

so make personal affects both of you

perception check yep as the scent of

perfume rose in tall the perfume

perception 15-19 okay you believe it has

a certain quality to it say

incapacitating quality I'd like you both

to make Constitution saving throws no

well he's in my aura so you get plus

five yes cool you get started get a

little light-headed and think the room

starts to swim a little bit around you

nineteen again twenty nine you both make

the save which is good you don't fall

unconscious

although the longer you remain in here

you think you might have to repeat the

saving throw but the poet the potions

and the admixture of the potions and the

poison have run across the floor kind of

in toward a corner around the seams of

what looks like a hidden trapdoor look

wouldn't you just know it and even

uncharacteristically because she usually

flies everywhere cheese isn't said to

stomp with her dirty potion feet across

the mattress over to the door home just

gonna open it okay make a strength check

Evelyn it's locked but you don't care

no I don't strength check will be a 13

okay you pull it open you snap it's a

little latch and you can see a chute

going down a little ways and then it

kind of turns into this metal tube that

connects to another hatch on the bottom

made of metal like a causeway and you

hear water up against the sides of this

metal tube like you're underwater

obviously this part of the ship would be

at this depth but you can to the

submarine anyone should we see what's

down there

it's just like a short little ladder

crawl down to this metal hatch on the

floor of this tube oh so there is a

ladder so it's meant for people yes okay

yeah I'll go down okay the hatch has a

wheel so you can just sort of spin the

wheel to open it up and when you open it

up you are now looking down into a

hallway of a submarine well aren't you

glad we did such a thorough search and

strix

what's your plan well we need to make

sure we find the other kids yes yeah oh

yeah we can't we don't find the other

kids but they know that they're just in

the room the cabin across from this one

oh so they're here yeah so let's go and

get them first and then we'll worry

about getting the ship away from we also

need to make sure that evil and paltin

are okay all right aye

also when your broom oh yeah that's

right I do need that I will I'll go

ahead and cook well

let's just open the door if there's

anyone behind it we'll just deal with

them all right just stand back we have

to stay quiet all right when you open up

the door you can peer there is a hallway

running across to the left and right one

toward the front the the four of the

submarine one toward the aft immediately

to your left our two doors one on each

side of the hallway and then an open

passageway leading right into the

command center where you see all this

dazzling array of mechanical controls

short little gnomes moving around

everywhere and you can hear what sound

like elven voices talking a pair of them

but you can't see the elves who are

doing the talking they are out of view

but they're definitely in the command

center and the command center has the

big round windows that look out into the

water Strix is like tf2 they right in

the hallway are two more or sorry is the

passage continues toward the back of the

submarine and you hear a sound like a

hatch opening come from coming from

somewhere back there you see the door

directly across from this one that

you've just opened is also closed then

that's where you believe Simon and Jenks

are all right

misterx is like yep I have an idea do

you hear me out coming out if if one of

us tries and yells and was like oh no

we're sinking or something and they

believe us then they'll leave and then

we can go I don't know I've been smart

today so I was just trying to be smart

again don't maybe we should just stab

them this is gonna be very close

quarters and not be the best way to

fight however if they say you they know

they can't afford a fight because you

could blow this whole thing right up you

owe me a scare them get the kids first

okay when you step into the hallway and

you open up the other door it's not

locked

and you peer inside you can see that the

other two kids

Simon Jenks are tied up in this room by

themselves this room is basically

furnished similarly to the one you were

just in there's nails they are not

gagged that's amazing alright I break

the drought there the lost statue of

this room - okay the base time I don't

care about being loud oh yeah and and oh

you're not caring about being loud you

just smash it on the floor okay at that

point in time we hear distress

throughout the ship I'd like everybody

to roll initiative all of you strokes

just a door let's speak you as compared

to something shatter alright let's start

with Strix 1212 DF look of surprise on

your face

13 evylyn 13:13 and paltin 17 so evylyn

you open up this hatch and it leads down

to a small let's call it an airlock

chamber a small little chamber with

another door but this one in the side of

the room it's just a small little thing

you can drop down inside of you can get

down and you can start opening up the

next door and as you open it up and you

hear this smashing sound followed by

well by take that evil

Strix that's me I just killed some evil

from somewhere else in the submarine you

hear evil in the say Strix evil I come

in here and that's evil in getting down

there and opening up the door the second

door with your action is pretty much all

you can do except to continue your move

if you want and you've still got about

20 feet of movement yeah I'll just

continue towards Strix alright then

you're able to follow the sound down the

hall to a pair of open doors leading

into separate cabins and you see Strix

and DF and the kids we found them I'm

also pretty sure that everyone on the

ship is now Halton never now what do you

want to do so because it's open yeah

would I be able to get in there and

still have an action absolutely and you

can even catch up to evil and and keep

up with her if you want

cool we'll catch up alright you're in

the heart of the submarine mmm now

you're taking a little bit more stock of

your surroundings as you follow any

villains wake you can see that there is

a side chamber at this end of the hall

that you entered through that has a

hatch leading down so there's probably a

lower level to this submarine and then

there's also a door at the back of the

sub marked engineering

but if evylyn went the other direction

toward the front of the sub and her

friends okay so then I get there and so

who's everyone I see I see you see evil

in the hallway with you and you see

Strix and DF in a cabin with Jenks and

Simon who are bound in ropes did you

close the doors behind you no Paul

didn't close the doors behind you -

submarine do you want to do that you can

do that okay you are now sealed behind -

airtight doors in this submarine with

your friends good thing I'm not

claustrophobic and we'll say that's Paul

Tain's and evil in a turn a alarm goes

off uh ma'am ma'am ma'am

throughout the submarine that's a bad

sound do you know what the Year death

two of the kids are still tied up

that would be Simon and jinx looks like

he's been crying yeah I'm gonna spend my

turn

getting them unbound I'll use a

combination of my cunning action and

fast hands to release them okay you're

able to do that effortlessly jinx

immediately starts crying about

Ferdinand he lost him somewhere and and

Simon Says Simon Says

they have waffles on one of the other

ships I don't know what happened to the

albear but she just went absolutely nuts

ruined the whole plan she probably

wanted to rub bits again what so a kid

who's like maybe like 80

yeah it's Timon knows what that is I'm

sure but Simon Says I'm pretty sure that

chairs on this submarine

well this submarine am i there you're in

the hall outside so you can hear this

submarine is evidence

the kidnapping we should probably take

it to the city who am I to argue people

and I my staff back oh yeah here you go

well I can't toss it to you I guess

right now cuz it's tricks it is your

turn you can walk over and grab the

staff if you want alright yeah I will

walk over and grab it like this it looks

like a broom right now actually um well

I will take it it's it's currently a

broom but that's okay it works the same

and I say there are peoples on this ship

should I go scare them

I mean if you want to okay we need to

come I march into the right you just

ride into the command center it is a

two-level rounded walled chamber that

has now you're on the upper floor so you

kind of come out onto a flying deck

which has to swivel chairs very sort of

futuristic with kind of like spider like

patterns to them on this flying deck

that looks down on the main deck below

you and from here you can get a pretty

good view out the windows into the dark

briny depths of Waterdeep Harbor and

below you you can see that there are two

gnome engineers one of whom is seated at

a chair in front of a console another

one is kind of lying down and fixing

something underneath the console so you

can only see his feet sticking out but

then there are also two Dark Elves down

there armored male dark elves with long

white hair crossbows and swords and when

you come out onto the deck they both

look up at you with their red glaring

eyes and I look down and I say don't

anyone move were pirates and that's

where little stop

all right sorry you hear pollen from the

back just are okay face-palming almost

this whole episode weird look really

competent things throughout this whole

episode I had to make it up okay yeah
