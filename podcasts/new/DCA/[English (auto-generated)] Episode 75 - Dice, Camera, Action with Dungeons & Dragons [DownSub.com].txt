[Music]

okay welcome everybody to dice camera

action our first episode of 2018 so

before we commence let me just say that

I as a DM I've always felt that the best

conflicts in this game are the ones that

the characters bring upon themselves

[Laughter]

agreed so with that in mind allow me to

recap the waffle crew to the lost city

of omou a sunken city in the heart of

the jungles of Kult having found the

ring of winter which is now worn on one

of paul Tain's fingers and shortly after

their arrival they met a tobacco to

backseat

they met at a back sea hunter who had

come to omou to basically enjoy a

hunter's death and look at that - yeah

he led them through the city avoiding

many of its perils the characters had a

run-in with a gargoyle a huge fire ball

went off courtesy of Strix which alerted

do you want tea in the city the snake

folk very intruders present and they

closed in around you until you finally

fought off several of them it is at the

tail end of that conflict that a great

shadow fell upon you all and it is the

shadow of the ancient red dragon Klaus

whom the characters last saw far to the

north when they were traveling by

airship it had come to secure the ring

of winter and added to its considerable

trove but the party managed to teleport

away depriving it of its prize and

forcing it to fly the 3700 odd miles

south to try to get it back drawn to it

purely by its scent for

dragon can smell treasure from thousands

of miles away

[Laughter]

all right and evylyn put herself

physically between the descending dragon

and the rest of the party and was

talking to it trying to basically talk

it down as it was descending upon you

and it is evil and turn everyone else is

running for cover right yes everyone

else and well not everyone bag of nails

standing on some standing on some ruined

stones you know tensing his bow as this

great lizard descends from the heavens

upon him everybody else is running I

think I am going to oh you know you know

those moments when you really don't want

your character to do something that they

are just gonna do it anyway so evil his

main concern is just that everybody gets

underground to hiding so she's uh she's

not necessarily like going toward the

dragon she's just trying to flank

Everett like everyone stay behind me I'm

gonna go in last kind of thing so her

she's gonna like hold action dodge and

dialog like just on the defensive ready

to defend herself have attacked but

otherwise he's just repartee right and

not even try to defend just try to get

out of the way okay cuz even evylyn

knows that she cannot I mean like she

didn't want to test them with the god

she also doesn't want to tussle with the

red dragon but she will she asked okay

anyway so

she says something to the effect of she

knows class by name right they're not on

a first-name basis but yes it's it's so

great to see you and I'm so glad we

found ourselves in the same neck of the

woods and it seems like you're real mad

and I wanted to remind you that we're

real good at negotiating and if there's

anything you want we'd love to hear

about it and we can just he says he

interrupts you at that point and says I

have just flown thousands of miles from

the spine of the world and boy my wings

are tired give me the ring and this can

end

oh the ring and just to be clear which

ring exactly as he depends upon you you

see his claws flex and unflexible ones

that have deployed from the tips of his

wings sort of turned in toward you and

he says the ring of the winter winter is

there is there anything else of value we

might be able to give you instead of

that if we can't find it don't play the

fool I okay well let me just go ask them

about it real quick and as she starts to

back away I'll save it I'll say to him

up put my bow down I've spent a lifetime

waiting to die at the hands of the likes

of something is great and allow me keep

talking okay heard time to back up okay

so both of us are doing yes stalling

we're just starting I'm standing right

there my bows down and I'll go over

cross-legged yeah

and present myself unarmed and I'll

basically say old great rich life my

entire life has been spent rangy draw

the small

my kid my people would be so proud for

me to give Milan and I'll just keep

talking at nauseam

okay giving them time to escape all

right like that strategy even ones real

down with that yes the dragon is about a

hundred and twenty feet away from evil

in about a hundred and eighty feet away

from the rest of the party and now it

rolls around to D a Saturnia

right yeah if you can hear a bag of

nails calling out a dragon you can hear

evil and high above calling out to the

dragon you can see it eclipsing the Sun

white ash falls in your eyes as you look

up toward them bag of nails was leading

us to the entrance correct he has

stopped and has now seated himself on a

ruin with his bow do we know where this

entrance is you know it's somewhere in

the palace which you are just outside of

the outer wall of the palace kind of

looms about 100 feet away so easy to get

around the wall yeah you know that you

were told that the wall is circular and

it contains within it a maze of inner

walls that have to be navigated to get

you to the heart of the palace there and

you believe is the entrance so the walls

themselves is its own glabrous

yes

[Laughter]

do you have some kind doors it's fine

right

I mean how this is a bad move Chris how

much how much did I just blow this oh

you know I completely destroyed any of

their opportunity to get to the front of

anything you have no way to know yet

because the dragon I'm sorry yeah the

yeah you know that hey we've done way

worse for our own party so don't worry

about oh yeah don't you worry oh yeah if

you know both Strix and paltin are going

to get to act before the Dragons next

turn okay and they're both here with me

in the general proximity yes actually

restricts is being carried over dragon

baits shoulder right now because she

basically fell down on the ground in

defeat

yeah he's picked her up and slung her

over his shoulder is now following

behind you paulten I need to know what's

going through your head when to when

Paul turns toward you you can see just a

flicker of blue light in his eyes look

look I got this do you I know you

physically have it right now yes I do I

got it it's right here no I don't want

you wearing that thing I think it's

dangerous and it makes me worried for

you but but I think you'd I both know

there's no way that he could have it

agree so from where we got can I see

like a pathway into like these circular

walls are various and have like run

around you last week you realized that

bag of nails was leaning you to a place

where the outer wall had kind of

collapsed forming this v-shaped hole

they even sort of climb over the

wreckage into so you are approaching a

section of the wall that has been partly

destroyed and can be climbed over okay

so we can't get it to the into the inner

part of the maze yes

okay I'll uh I'll tell DF while we're

talking it's like you go I have an idea

and no I'm not playing the hero

III do not plan to die here dude no one

here is going to be a hero where's

getting out we'll be safer with in the

maze they'll be harder for him to reach

I think at least block some of that fire

right I have I have one more thing I'm

going to try before we go but it doesn't

involve anyone else with me so you go

just trust me and this is something that

dia think they do a whole lot but like

just completely naturally 100% without

hesitation he actually trusts Alton and

then like signals the power you didn't

like just cards getting over that wall

with your then just whatever I natural

what kind of Dungeon since I have about

Afghanistan you get people through

honest good so you are just basically

moving which means you can move your

speed twice your speed plus are you

dashing or are you gonna try to stay

close to your party I'll cutting action

- to kind of get ahead okay stick

conatus okay yes sir - look it's just

like a second or two I'm gonna survey it

I think God is going something right

then you're able to get sort of halfway

up the rubble that's in this collapsed

section of the wall pretty much right up

to the wall itself or pretty darn close

and as you kind of peer up over the

rubble you can see that the interior

walls like the outer wall are curved

it's like entering through a hole in the

edge of a round maze yeah I got you uh

the interior walls are the same height

as the outer wall so there's basically a

looks like a curved passage that you'll

be entering that winds its way deeper

into the palace but you're not really

close enough to use your dungeon sense

yet you're not in the maze proper gotcha

okay and you turn around and you can see

dragon bait is following you is tricks

over the shoulder but Alton clearly is

not and it is now Strix astern Strix you

are currently being carried on so

you don't have to don't have to use

movement at all are you doing anything

else he's just staying limp once like

she's realized that they started running

at least just like you'll think you

could let me go and because you're over

here because you're over dragon bait

shoulder you are actually looking back

toward paulten and getting farther away

from him and also getting farther away

from bag of nails and evil and okay well

I know I also know that paltin got that

snake gift so he can't he can't be

killed

technically you still get knocked the F

out and then have just taken away how

that's true that is that is true but I'm

trying to feel who can be killed

evylyn can be killed well is there a

certain amount of damage that someone

could do that would negate the can't die

thing because I'm busy period he auto

stabilizes but if you are reduced to

your negative hit points attack you will

die instantly

yep so not so safe so back to you Strix

okay before before we like get away from

him is there any way that I could just

like slap it slap paltin and just death

bored him no okay he's still in front of

me or too far back too far back you have

to basically use your action to break

dragon baits grapple or mimic or use a

bonus action to misty step out of dragon

baits clutches of next to Politan and

then touch him but then I can't get away

from him well yes you can because if you

miss the step it's a bonus action token

it's an action and you can still use

your movement okay perfect

alright that's what I'm gonna do I'm

gonna miss you step out a dragon baby

like I'm sorry alright he stands there

carrying nothing like cuz I heard palton

I'm like Bolton don't die please and his

death warning alright Strix appears next

new palton touches you with some sort of

necromantic effect and then runs away

clutching her hat to her head kicking up

her heels yeah

yeah and she's gonna try and catch up

with DF after that so thank you

she's farther back than she was before

okay and so that's strictest turn now

with death ward on do you want to tell

me what that does just so yes so death

word it's a 100 on the read up

I actually don't have my cards for death

word I said a broad enough so pretty

much what it is

the first time that you would drop to 0

hit points as a result of taking damage

the target instead drops to 1 hit point

and the spell ends but if the spell is

still an effect on the target is subject

to an effect that would kill it

instantaneously without dealing damage

like power would kill or something like

that

the effect is instead negated against

the target so you pretty much can't die

yeah / - it's that first time right yeah

so I have that stacked with the UH the

the snake gift yes okay cool all right

after she does that waffles by the way

is bolting off in the direction of death

as well just so you all know and I know

I slapped her on the butt instead

yeah and we come around to panthan okay

I look up at what's the Dragons name

again Klaus Klaus and we we both speak

we can communicate right you and the

dragon yeah you can hear it's making

common - evylyn okay so I wanna I'm

gonna call up to him I'm just like my

dude look I know what you're here for I

hold up the ring yes you want this right

yes

like you and I we both want the same

thing I think with how much I've attuned

to the ring now more rather its attune

to me I think we could work together

with this to get the same thing I'm

gonna try and persuade him to not kill

me with that if I may sure you can make

a charisma persuasion check and I'm

going to give you disadvantage because

he really wants them and he doesn't like

being called my dude man without this

advantage I would have been at 2008 20

shows up yeah yep

Nate 20 total 25 okay that's really good

do-do-do-do-do excellent alright you'll

know how the dragon responds momentarily

but you you do sense that the dragon

heard your words and internalized your

words and thinking about your words as

it descends down upon you and in that

moment before the dragon gets to take

its action which is the next action

[Music]

actually before the dragon gets to go

bag of nails I want to do anything on

your turn physically speaking I mean I

assume that not taking he's not taking

very much interest in my begging to die

on this day he is somewhat fixated on

the ring that seems to be an are

consuming thing about that but you do

you are certainly aware that he is

attuned to and listening to everything

and seeing everything that's happening

around him in fact you can see his eyes

sort of rolling in his skull and doing

kind of a mental inventory of everything

on the ground that's

moving faster than a snail so he how far

away is he from me right now 180 feet

he's so he's basically above all of us

yeah and you have action if you want to

take it or you can continue to try to

draw him with the the dulcet tones of

your to backseat voice I get no sense

that that's working you you get the

sense that you're competing with evylyn

now and paltin now for the dragons

attention I'm going to break off of this

trajectory okay I'm going to take a

female feline image do lead us to the

front I'm gonna change tactics okay

going over I'll stay high and flipping

in and trying to lead us to the mouth

okay so here basically going with D F

and the other fleeing party members and

rejoining the fleeing group actually of

course yeah I'll do that you asked for

basically a lay of the land

DF and company.the at the edge of the

palace wall is about a hundred feet away

from you and that's kind of where DF and

the albear and dragon bait and Strix are

all headed and very close to you like

about 20 feet away and a little bit

below you on the ground is paltin with

the ring and standing next to him is his

little construct companion Simon who

sort of tightens his hand around the

boltons other hand that he's not holding

up at the dragon and then evylyn is

above you about 60 feet high but as

toward the fleeing party members palton

and evil and are gonna get farther away

from you you're gonna leave them behind

it's okay just okay using whatever

little has to sort of wave the party

below her

I might think to live and want to play

in this campaign forever I don't think

that's what you would do I think bagging

nails will stay okay of course it

actually really wanted okay and saving

my action for when he gets dropped yeah

to go down and save his body before it

takes okay

all right all right I'm gonna hold my

action and wait till he gets eaten you

enter a state of cat-like resident

readiness yeah all right all right

yeah the tail starts to twitch yeah okay

at that point in time coming up over the

edge of the cliff and the trees high

above is a thing another large flappy

thing is it a good thing it is this

[Music]

alright this thing comes up over the

trees and begins to drift over the city

toward the palace toward you and toward

the dragon when d/f sees this he's just

like are you alright yeah

and everybody who cares too can make a

perception check yes or a wisdom check

if you don't have perception the skin I

don't know why nails you do that the

perception check you have a +7 just

really or six Anna okay great

[Applause]

you said we could do wisdom if we don't

have perception so nice enough Oh cuz

it's the same thing duh

okay yeah eleven eleven no okay 19 19

okay

also eleven okay so bag of nails and D F

you're the only ones who can see three

figures on the deck of the ship one

appears to be near the back by the wheel

of the ship looks like might be a woman

possibly elvish or half elvish hard to

tell and she's wearing a sort of a a hat

on her head with a feather and then on

the rigging you see a shorter figure

that looks like it might be a gnome or a

halfling in some sort of vest and then

at the front of the figure at the front

of the ship manning what looks like a

giant harpoon gun is a teeth wing

and you hear the tiefling say the two of

you here and say we got to get closer

[Laughter]

okay and then the dragon gets to go I'm

also really confused because I don't

know who any of these people are the

dragon moves or fly is a hundred and

sixty feet on its turn which one would

it passed you evil and do you want to

take an opportunity attack as it

descends past you I think you're muted

evylyn oh that was to me do I want to

say yeah the dragon passes by you evil

and it just drops oh pastor no I do not

take an opportunity attack that then it

goes right past you you see it it makes

some effort to like avoid colliding with

you it doesn't want to provoke another

wait is it going directly for palton yes

looks like it's not to attack him you

would consider its posture threatening

damn it Chris Perkins I gave her

inspiration to get a one I'm gonna give

her anti inspiration I want I want to

make it look like an accident I want to

like bump it with my ass well make the

attack first

[Music]

okay that's completely he doesn't even

feel it that just that probably just

sort of bounces off his scaly arse and

now make a deception check to make it

look accidental that's persuasion no

[Applause]

okay if the dragon cares it doesn't show

it and continues its descent upon paltin

paltin as this giant red lizard comes

down upon you you see it kind of flex

and open its claws it's at that point in

time when the ring intrudes upon your

will and tells you that under no

circumstances must be the dragon must

the dragon be allowed to take it it will

not the ring says be consigned to

oblivion in the dragon's hoard or forced

to heed the will of a creature as mighty

as that much more malleable and

controllable and free ranging than this

dragon is just I understood all right

and then the dragon is going to land on

top of you you mean you mean next to me

like one foot on the other side of its

claw actually comes right down on top of

you and it makes an attack roll against

you oh good which is going to hit and

but instead of trying to damage you it

just basically comes down and just like

scoops you and a big chunk of the ground

out and up

in its claw so you are stuck in its claw

with big heaps of dirt and moist plants

all around you like look and Simon is

still holding on your hand so he's kind

of in the claw as well and the dragon

just holds you up in front of its mouth

yes is when we count like reflexes at

the facts he kick in yeah I'm gonna jump

on this try to jump on its back

alright so because he's gone down below

me correct and I'm up high it's a big

dragon so even though you're high up

it's still like jumping onto the back of

a jumbo jet but I'm going to it's got a

tail that you can kind of run up to get

up yeah so I'm gonna have you but this

is dandy where failure is always an

option this is Dee Dee with Kris however

you get to make an athletics check okay

alright doing styling grace yes well not

with grace but with stop yeah you run up

the tail and it afflicts you off but

like a cat

you just sort of land on another perch

nearby okay yeah great great so it

actually sort of tossed you up in the

air so you can actually land higher than

you were supposed to all right let's see

the dragon technically has other actions

but there isn't really anything else it

wants at present that said it is going

to activate its frightful presence

ability kind of let out this deafening

roar and I would like ya know it's

hilarious I was complaining that like at

next level I don't really get anything

cool the only thing is that I make it to

the people around me can't get

frightened yeah what a lame thing

that'll never happen

actually it's gonna it's gonna hold off

on that for the minute it's not gonna do

anything else it's got what it wants in

its claw it's gonna wait to see what

paltin does next and it is do let's see

it is evil ends turn well I guess that I

see that this is Pontins plan and she

just apologized to paltin for not

trusting his plan last time so she's

gonna try to trust him but no way is she

leaving so she's gonna try and be close

to him to aid him with her aura and

she's going to cast something Noble what

will it be

choose Emma cast she's gonna cast a aid

okay so palton who is the recipient of

many great doings this I'm gonna do like

nothing yes so I do cast a third law

soap Alton your hit point maximum and

your current hit points go up go up by

five if you're casting it at first no no

you guys think it's three three yeah no

that'd be additional 500 second

so you'd be you got ten ten hit points

balton cool alright and palton now that

you can sort of see the dragon's mouth

through the dirt in your eye there are

tremendous ripples of heat it's coming

out of its mouth as it speaks

but it is now

yes attorney D F you are over at the

wall of the maze about sorry to clarify

I did get close enough to him so that

all of my aura stuff can happen so ten

feet okay so you're right up next to

paltin basically and the claw of the

Dragon you see your you see paltin and

evil in in in close proximity to the

dragon at this point your other party

members are scampering toward you bag of

nails after a frantic attempt to scale

onto the dragon got flung on to a ruin

and not too far away from the dragon

that blimp airship thingy is drifting if

are closer to the dragon and you see

that harpoon guns sort of being angled

downward Christ and I see palton just

drifts he's in the grips of the dragons

along with a big chunk of the earth that

the dragon just ripped up out of the

ground yeah and he told me he had a plan

yep he did he's still alive so it's

working I guess well never thought I'd

be happy to see in it

acquisition incorporated load oh so

close by before high so for I am could I

make us think I've ever seen

can I make any kind of servants on this

maze or how to get through it or a

general direction or survey like a quick

path through I think it might be easier

if you climb to the top of the wall I'm

a dudette okay make an athletics trick

alright there are lots of vines clean up

the wall so it's not a hard climb yep

and I have second-story work so depth

really easy to do super duper just

athletics yep

13 yeah you scamper up to the top of the

wall grabbing on to ivy and handholds

when you reach the top from the top of

the wall you can see that sort of Maisie

lay out before you and I will allow you

to make an intelligence check to to see

a path okay just IntelliJ

yep all right it's not too bad

14 okay you think you have quickly

determined to pass through the maze it

is a long and winding path but it will

get you to the center where you see from

up here the crumbled down ruins of what

used to be the central domed Palace

right and if I believe there's a faster

way to get there but the only thing

that's in the way is a single wall I

have a tiny horn on my belt that blasts

when tooted so if I believe I can use

that destroy a wall to get us there

faster that's just the path I take okay

do you think you can divine a path that

will get faster with the aid of the horn

all right and then with that I like

return right to the party this towel

you'll be stuck up on the wall because

you basically look at an action to

divine a path through the maze I got you

can shout down to your friends okay I'll

start putting him in the right direction

at the same time I am still just staring

at the palton that altercation happening

right now an altercation Wow okay

excellent

good round 4df strix oh we can't leave

we can't leave them oh yeah and you by

the way you obviously recognize the

battle blimp hundred feet above you oh

of course

yeah and I also do I see I believe it

was tweed and yes hibner the teeth wing

is on the gun tweed is on the rigging

and I think her name is a laundry on oh

yeah it was a laundry oh yeah she is she

is that she's captaining the ship

navigating yeah I spent a lot of time

with them so you did spend a lot of time

with them you got to know them pretty

well yeah laundry ax you miss cubby horn

swallow the no man was killed don't yeah

that's right whoops oh well I'm actually

actually tweed will probably wave at you

okay oh wait I'll weave back and point

at the dragon like please kill please

point yeah yeah he shouts down at you

and he says we're gonna kill it

don't worry I haven't like

yeah evil it's like what did they say

they say they were gonna kill the dragon

she's like pointing at that like trying

to be like jagged look at that instead

of is there how far away am i from

evylyn you are probably about sixty feet

away from evil in a perfect okay

so before I continue I'm going to do the

same thing I did before and misty step

next to evil innovators in the dead

board on evil okay just take off Friday

all right now she's flying so you just

sort of fall to the ground after you

talk I have my broom so I can oh I see

okay yes you're gonna we're gonna broom

over to her casters yeah away yes God so

I'm a mist well actually if I have

enough if I have enough inaction to get

close well I'll misty step and then

broom away yeah it's easier thank you

but because I love you I must insist

that you run it's probably easier if you

broom there and back because activating

your broom is an action got it okay so

that's what I'm gonna do okay so alright

then I really fast like I'm just like

like so evil then you get you get

drive-by touched with a spell and the

screaming is happening at the same yes

this broom billowing smoke sort of beers

awful dragon at that point with Strix on

the battle that's screaming Doppler

effect exactly okay that's tricks astern

dragon bait is just making following DS

directions and going into the palace

along with waffles that he's sort of

goading along every time Strix takes off

waffles inherently wants to run in her

direction sort of hemming her off and

blocking her off and trying to get her

going where she's supposed to it's a

full-time job Paul say she's like I'm

not leaving again this is fine I got

everyone fault in you sees

past after doing something to evil and

you are caught up in the dragon's flaw

the dragon will look at you and says go

along leave us alone

puny one I agree that was like yeah the

grown-ups are talking

so I'm going to tell him since the ring

has attuned to me it has become much

more powerful and if I were to give it

back to you it would only be a fraction

of what it's capable of now and I want

to try and deceive him and him to go

ahead and make a deception jack 21 he

says nice try oh okay you know because

I've done my research I know more about

the ring than you can possibly imagine

trust me when I say it will be safest

with me so huge so he's got me in his

clutches bond like one claw and with a

hunk of dirt in his touches right in

front of your face he's holding you up

right in front of his face now am I like

super grappled or is it like making like

a cage that I'm standing in you're kind

of in a clump of dirt you are

technically being grappled you can break

or slip out of the grapple though with a

skill check you after you have to beat

his strength athletics check he didn't

buy it okay so then I guess my follow-up

question

is how does flesh to ice work so you

cast it on a creature and if they fail

saves they they begin to turn into ice

you saw artists Cimber do this to a

white dragon up in the glaciers he

turned it to ice it didn't turn into ice

instantaneously it sort of gradually

became ice after failing a sequence of

saving close those who do you by the way

Constitution saving throws which for a

dragon of this size would not be hard

for it to make fair okay how far up from

the ground is he holding me Oh about

thirty feet that's not too high and

would you say it's relatively soft snow

below me there's no snow but there is a

thin layer of fashion on the ground and

there's sort of a a pit of mud under you

where he tore the ground up out of and

is now holding you about it okay could I

try with the ring could I try and spawn

a spike growth right where I am

to see if that'll like break his break

his grip let me check the spell can be

cast do did you do

spike growth basically creates ice

spikes I just want to check to see what

they have to be on it has to be on the

ground the ground and the dirt is

technically around me that is not that

is from the ground would not walk

correcting it okay okay all right

can I just I'm gonna try to just cone a

cold right into his face dead

no you see Paul Dan's plan unfold before

your honor and your jaw just sort of as

this blast pole just sort of hits clouds

right in the eye because he has you I'm

gonna say he has a disadvantage on his

saving throw to get out of the way of

the spell all right

he's still even with his lowest roll

beats your save DC so he sort of quickly

when he sees you

activating the ring he sort of turns the

claw away so that your cone kind of only

brushes up against him but roll the

damage it's a k-8 d8 he'll take half of

it today mirror that damage he'll be

weakened for next time that's right okay

so that would be half of 36 so 18 a few

icicles sort of catch him on the side

bill and on his ear and you see some

frost form on his scales and next to his

eye but he didn't take a ton of damage

it doesn't seem to have a huge impact on

him he's a big bag of hit points and he

holds on to you however and his precious

ring

and that that concludes paltin cepa's

turn now Simon will just hold on to you

that's all he's gonna do you say he's

staying with you through thick and thin

he's latched around your leg yeah yeah

is reflecting on his life and says you

know what

okay bag of nails yeah Chris how close

is the is the blimp

so the blimp is slowly drifting downward

it was over a hundred feet away when you

last saw it's about a hundred feet above

you and getting lower by the minute okay

it's trying to angle itself it's not

trying to come down so it can be within

closer shooting range to the dress does

it look like it's gonna do in charge

would that be boys get the ballista it's

got its got its got the big spar on the

front but it looks like it's actually

taking aim with what appears to be a

harpoon gun on deck now this harpoon gun

is huge and the harpoon that's mounted

to it looks like it's it must be about

16 feet long it looks like a harpoon

designed to fight dragons it is at that

moment however that you see the gnome on

the rigging he does something like he

unties something and then this long

ladder this rope ladder drops down the

side of the ship almost all the way to

the ground okay what sounds weird am I

on the same side of the dragon as the

Rope is coming down remind others you're

on the same side move action to get to

the other side of him okay and then I'm

gonna hit him with I'm gonna distract

I'm gonna try to distract him with a

lightning I have I have the lightning

spell lighting arrow yeah so it's going

I'm gonna attempt to distract him away

from the incoming attack okay make an

attack and then your lightning arrow

will ad remember how much extra damage

yeah it's full I think I believe it's 48

all right I'll look it up but let me let

me go check for d8 it is 48 right oh

yeah and half damage on a Miss okay I

will the 14 so it's 20 it's 26 then you

are going to hit the dragon

nice all right now someone can do it

so roll roll Baylin regenerated roll

damage I have 48 down it's been damaged

so I have plus t8 for cloth that's right

so that's 24 and then I get for those

who don't know but he has the Colossus

Slayer feature which means he deals more

damage to big big creatures good news

we've brought you a colossus lightly

they just say 35 or 45 it's 30 35 that's

ferocious okay when you sting him with

that you definitely get his attention

and actually I will make a check to see

if he holds on to palton okay that shock

causes him to unclench his claws Paul to

you and Simon and this big pile of dirt

fall down into this mud hole can I can I

react and try to like catch him or

cushion this ball

in fact palton I'm gonna have you make a

dexterity saving through cool that's

much better

[Music]

16 okay you're able to kind of land in

the soft mud and let it break your fall

so you don't take any damage and when

you look next to you you can just see

Simon's legs sticking up out of the mud

and just sort of kicking when you do

like his lower half is just the big kind

of mud ball all this mud dripping off of

him good boy but he might do your view

you're gonna start hanging upside down

and he you just sort of look down at his

face and he looks up at you and just

gives you a thumbs up we leave for

another few seconds so yes and then this

huge tail

around as the creature the dragon turns

to see what the source of its pain was

yeah and the dragon looks at you bag of

nails and says weren't you over there a

second ago

no I'm your greatest enemy fight not for

long

all right next step is oh that was bag

of nails it is the acquisitions Inc a

blimps turn it drops down drops down to

about a height of 60 feet and then you

see the teeth fling on the gun take aim

with the harpoon and the harpoon launch

forth and misses the dragon completely

[Music]

flies over and it sort of takes a chunk

out of this old ivy-covered obelisk of

past the dragon and when the obelisk

just sort of teeters for a second and

falls with a huge thunderous thud into

the ground shattering on impact and you

hear him nurse say I killed the obelisk

tweede help me reload he hops down off

the harpoon gun and searches around for

another piece of ammunition and the

blimp is done and meanwhile it's a

ladder it's rope ladders sort of

dragging across the ground nearby and

that's it for it and it is the Dragons

turn Klaus will look down upon bag of

nails and

[Music]

breathe yeah yeah bag of nails you you

could not fathom that fire could be this

hot make a dexterity saving throw no

problem bro 13 plus 9 so 22 excellent

that does not save against the dragon's

breath well I think at some point you

can just stop rolling he's definitely

not within 10 feet of me right all right

you take 91 points of fire damage now

remember you ate a seed from a nature

spirit during the last game that gave

you fire resistance no that was poison

resistance I stand corrected

no you burn so you take 91 points of

damage and this huge big column of flame

erupts from a channel and I'm surprised

to still be standing yeah yeah you see

all the feathers on bag of nails have

sort of burned away and he's just a sort

of blackened fire scorched cat standing

in this swath of burnt annihilated

ground you can see that the stone behind

him is melting and bag of nails has just

never been more aroused in his life

exactly but based on his current based

on his current appearance you don't

think he could survive another one

but the dragon after the smoke clears

and the flame clears the dragon kind of

give us a strange look like what all

right and that's it for him this term

and next up is

evylyn evylyn you just saw this huge

cone of flame and it goes for hund

Mike over a hundred feet off in a

direction engulfing buildings and plants

and everything else and then you see

both you and Klaus kind of stare in

amazement as the screaming cat man

stands before it even is like it takes

her a second to like shake off her

amazement and impress but she says let's

go cotton before she does anything she

wants to ask him a question do you have

to mentioned or can you get yourself out

yep even just ghosts okay goes in what

direction toward easements tricks okay

toward the palace got it all right so

you boogie and you get over to death and

the others no problem with all your

movement DF yeah you're on the wall you

can see away from you now halten lying

at the foot of the dragon in mud with

simon and bag of nails defiantly

trilling his war cry before the big

reptile yeah so I can start leading

people uh but do I believe that paltin

could probably catch up I know he's got

tricks you can probably catch up I don't

think I can get so far ahead that he

would get lost in the maze without us

yeah okay so yeah with that I'll just

descend back down okay off the wall and

start as fast as possible sprinting for

you and getting everyone through this

maze to or this is tomb entrance okay as

much as that we can excellent

it is trick cistern you're on your broom

still screaming I am going to be

following I'm following

DF and who wears waffles and dragon bait

behind me or there with the earth okay

yeah I will catch up with them alright

and with

and with evil and with evil I knew the

evylyn and waffles and dragon bait are

all sort of in a clump now entering the

maze of the palace okay

following deals directions through the

palace I will broom up to DF and use my

last def word okay all right dia if you

are touched at the death ward spell

dragon bait and waffles will simply

follow along at this point in time now

there they got a wall between them and

the dragon they feel dragon bait feels a

little bit better and his scent changes

and then we come back to palton and

Simon okay right so do I see where

everyone was running - yeah you sort of

looked back you're lying prone on the

actually you're sort of sitting up after

pulling Simon out of the ground you're

up on your knees then you can see your

party member are fleeing into the palace

about a hundred feet away okay

and I just please grab Simon and

dimension or right to them take one

other creature

so that would be Simon and you're

dimension door I believe has well

sufficient range to get there it's like

400 or so much yes it's a massive range

so you're you're good

dimension door and you are with your

friends just show you come tumbling

through an aperture and just sort of

tumble down the wreckage of the stone

wall to your friends and then boogie

with Simon running behind you okay at

the end of your action the dragon is

going to take one of its legendary

actions which it hasn't done yet that

sounds wonderful do not want yes no you

see well that it seems to while not

taking it's not taking one eye off of

bag of mail just turns its head slightly

and the bag of nails you can just sort

of insight or divine that the dragon has

this sort of uncanny perceptiveness of

its surroundings

and it seems to be taking stock and

listening to the footfalls of all the

creatures that are now currently moving

away from it and counting them and

ascertaining exactly how far they are

away from it while at the same time

gauging the proximity of the balloon

okay so he knows he knows everything and

he looks like a very canny opponent you

see that now that you're really really

close to it his flesh between the scales

has all of these ancient battle scars

and he

is done and so it is your turn bag of

nails that's how we feel every week

belly you are right in front of him here

when you look straight up you see his

head so you are as close to it is you

can be without being actually under it

okay let me grab my bow mm-hmm and I'm

gonna say something profound you get him

yep so you're standing right there his

chest is right there you're all right

making a choc roll it is my honor to be

your phone pay attention to this moment

and never forget it and then he turns as

you're shooting at me says bag of oh my

god four twos 2021 all right well that

hurts him yeah you don't you that arrow

zaps right into his body okay like I'm

waiting just to be sort of a come at me

bro kind of yeah all right

as paltin see all this yeah in the

corner of your eye is you descend down

into the ruins with your friends calling

me is what this moment is yes evylyn

wouldn't have left except she relates

the idea of a warrior being like this is

my time to go into the light so she's

watching this with like move tears but

not like sad tears more like crowd

beautiful tears but not but not real

tears because she can't cry running and

sees all this you just like system self

very later just alright

as you pull away bag of nails you are

surprised when let me just double check

something here before I open my big fat

mouth you're surprised when the dragon

says cool bro we can be dudes yeah you

are surprised when there is a flurry of

rocks that fly up over your head past

you and start to pound pound the dragon

it's like this hail of rocks of volley

of rocks just launches over you and each

rock is only you know about that big

around and if it were to hit you and

probably knock you unconscious but they

just sort of bounce harmlessly off of

the dragon's scales that looks terribly

annoying for about six seconds as this

flurry happens and then out of the weeds

around you you see a bunch of small

little creatures that look like they are

made of tangled vegetation and they've

got these sort of little top knots of

vegetation on tops of their heads and

they charge the dragon with wooden

Spears and start to stab it in the feet

jeez having no effect on it whatsoever

but the dragon is sort of looking around

and there there are about 25 of them

four of them run in front of you and

stand in front of you with Spears out

like they're going to protect you

awesome they're dead yeah and then the

dragon takes its tail and just knocks it

up knocks about ten of them off into the

bush into oblivion and it is the bull of

the balloons turn you can see up above

you bag of nails behind the dragon the

big red balloon it's the ship is kind of

turning in a weird way like maybe it's

not meant to and you can see you can see

a a fling and a gnome struggling to

reload the harpoon cannon by themselves

and it is the Dragons full first turn it

is now going to use its frightful

presence and when it exudes this

supernatural fear all of the little

creatures around you scatter and flee

back into the ruins except for one

standing right in front of you and he's

just there with trembling spear he's so

scared he can't move we get ya and the

rest of the Dragons oh and I need you to

as well bag of nails to make a wisdom

saving throat okay then you are overcome

by the frightful presence you are

frightened for one minute

which means mechanically that you have

disadvantage on all attack roles while

the source of your fear is present

alright and and you can't you can't move

closer to the dragon than you already

are you know but at the end of each of

your turns you'll get to repeat the safe

to try to end the effect and overcome

your fear until then oh and I have to

make saving throws for the ones on the

balloon as well no okay not so you hear

shrieks of panic on the balloon and

that's it for the dragon

something except no it actually has a

move action so it is going to take to

the sky opportunity you do you're a

disadvantage because you're frightened

but you do get your attack of

opportunity so roll to D 20 and take the

lower result alright okay yeah no you

make a vain attempt to scratch it with

your claws and then realize that's a

horrible idea

hello welcome and then it takes to the

sky it will leap and fly 80 feet up and

it is going to be pretty much right next

to the balloon actually a little bit

above the balloon when it's finally

finished

oh they're gonna be so mad recharges its

breath weapon alright and then we come

to evil and I'm going to smell I mean

we're just running away into this maze

right now right right correct yes you

can do nothing except to flee I'm going

to hold action to cast a spell if we

become attacked can I do that

not really okay unless you're just gonna

stay here if you want to move and you

stay with your friends you've got to

keep up and use some of your movement

which means you're okay and there's a

bonus action I will say really annoying

happy encouraging things okay yes you're

trailblazing following the path that

you've charted in your head

uh-huh do you want to do things is

everyone accounted for bag of nails is

not accounted for right everyone else is

okay yeah just

continuing that trail okay guy need to

get us out of here I need gonna I'm just

round one I have to into it's like the

safest place we could be from Africa

dragon make a perception check he just

wanted to go into the light it was

really beautiful right we gonna leave

him to his death like he didn't want to

he wanted to right cuz he wanted to go

into the light you know eyes forward

evylyn yeah I'm trying to pick a d20

that won't let me down perception you

said yes 23 great as you are moving

through the ruins

you are aware enough of your

surroundings to know that slithering out

of some of the rubble around you our

snakes vigilant guards that you believe

could be maybe they're ordinary snakes

or maybe they're you want II in shape

changed form okay we resisted okay you

catch the movement as you rush forth

blazing your trail are they moving in

such a way that it looks like it's going

to prevent momentum no they're not big

enough to impose themselves in any way

upon your path they just sort of crawl

out of the ruins as you are as you and

your friends are passing by which

suggests that you've gotten their

attention alright I'm going to at least

point said snakes out districts okay to

do with that information what you will

yeah snakes alright and it is strict

cistern snakes out and she's maybe or

may or may not be Yatta Yatta move she's

on her broom well she if there's snakes

I can fireball some of them yeah you'll

have to drop the fireball in the midst

your party but you can do that okay yeah

as soon as you're like snakes

[Laughter]

yes what is there saving trail oh sorry

my spell save to UC is 16 okay

and so yeah alright you engulfed four

snakes

total to succeed and to failed so give

me damage 29 alright and that's 14 okay

they are all scorched by that but much

to your surprise

none of them are killed what they're not

normal stage and then then they assume

their true forms they basically turn

into these guys yeah

good to see you again and let's see did

you do and but that is their action on

their turn so that's all they can do is

assume their true form and next up is

palton so we're running in these you're

running through this maze and then

suddenly these snakes turn into snake

men in your midst and they're about all

four of them have taken damage from

Strix this fire line we're all still

running yeah yes you are now they are

now among you I'm gonna try and this

very fire work on multiple targets

within a range yeah each object in a

20-foot queue yeah so that would get

them all okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do

that alright so they all begin to glow

with a blue green or violet light your

choice ah oh yeah all right

okay two of them are glowing and two of

them are not

okay they are glowing blue okay all

right guys I don't know do something and

the good thing is while they are glowing

attack rules against them have advantage

so there's that so two of them are

easier to hit because they've got faerie

fire glows around them lon

yep and you and Simon continue moving uh

and then bag of nails we're back up to

you the dragon has gone airborne you are

standing in a scorched path of ground

eighty feet below the dragon which is

and the rope ladder just sort of brushes

past your nose okay cast cure wounds at

second level on myself okay good call

another two by the way just so you know

and don't forget to add your yester

bility yeah yeah which is one per ranger

that would be that's wisdom so it's plus

three all right and then with my move

action I'll take my um my beeline

agility which is basically a double move

right now and I'm gonna make my way

towards the that where the party went

okay yep

alright so you follow across the ground

bounding after them you don't see them

at present they've gone into the walls

and have disappeared from sight but you

head off in that direction and if you

double move you'll get almost all most

of the way to the wall okay moving

moving through ruins as you go while

that's going on the blimp is still

trying to reload and bag of nails you're

the only one who can hear that the blimp

crew and that seems to be only three of

them

yelling at each other to try to get the

harpoon gun loaded in fact they've had

to take the DRI the navigator off the

wheel to get her help to try to set us

up anyway so the ship is just kind of

turning and listing through the air to

the point where it's basically its back

end is dragging right now and the dragon

is just sort of looking at it with a wry

smile on its reptilian face and you hear

the dragon say I always liked this ship

[Laughter]

and then it is Klaus turn he did not

recharge his breath weapon in front care

about the ship so he leaves the balloon

spinning around helplessly flies around

it and proceeds to fly over the palace

walls

now knowing exactly where you guys were

headed based on his tracing your

footsteps the previous round you see

again his big shadow pass over bag of

nails pass over the crumbled wall and

the head of the reptilian dragon appear

over the edge of the wall flying down

upon you and it veers off swoops and

bodily throws itself up against the wall

to knock it down on top of all of you I

would like all of you to make a

dexterity saving throws everyone's

within 10 feet of me so everyone gets +5

yes everybody gets plus 5 on their

dexterity saving throws against the wall

being knocked down on top of you correct

you are out of range out of sight and

out of danger 22 22 21 21 Simon waffles

dragon bait alright okay you are all

buried in the wall they all add up you

make sure you can't I counted

everybody's don't worry about it you

make sure yeah everybody is buried in

the wall and everybody takes what's

wrong - you can stop rolling now

twenty-two points of bludgeoning damage

okay and you are all proud and

restrained Chris yeah I've evasion okay

so that is a dexterity save you can yes

so I took half yes

so you took 11 points of damage okay

does that myself buried in all that - uh

no it takes half of the normal damage I

don't I don't quite have more 1/4 if he

had made the saving through now let me

just see if evasion lets you dodge any

collateral effects of taking the dead

right that sounds more worried about

that you know what I'm gonna say yes you

have avoided being suffering the other

effects of the damage so everybody

around you d/f is buried under the

rubble but you aren't with your evasion

you were able to prevent yourself from

being pinned and buried underneath it

and you just see this whole tumble down

massive stone come upon them and they

immediately go into defensive postures

and the ground is not perfectly level so

some of them might depend in safety

little cubbies but all you see death is

a cloud of Ash and grit as this wall

falls down and then on the other side of

the wall you see the dragon kind of rear

up and sort of with a self-satisfied

grin look over the damage it is rot

that's its turn

evylyn you are pinned and restrained

under rubble you can't see or hear

anybody else you can just hear the sound

like crumpling stone and cascading stone

and tumbling stone over your head it

ones like like underneath she's really

strong so I picture her and kind of one

of those superhero like super strong

dances and she's like but she doesn't do

anything for herself yet but she casts

or a vitality instead just out from her

and so so now healing energy radiates

from her in an aura with a 30 foot

radius it moves with her and I can use a

bonus action to cause one creature in

the aura including myself to regain 2d6

hit points okay and you need to see said

creature it does not say that it says

only what I just said

okay then there you go who would you

like to benefit from this so I think

that evil UNS first thought would be for

Politan so it goes to him

okay paltin you can roll a lot of the

healing if you want to evilly to d6 yes

Paulson do you have any yeah floor so

you get four more okay here's a pre

action alright so miraculously you feel

evil ins holy warmth pass through the

stones reach out to you and imbue you

with this godly whose rejuvenations

and you know you know it comes from her

and you know I'm sorry the other benefit

of the aura is what evylyn apart from

the healing anything no it's just that

okay great it's just I get a bonus

action each time to heal someone with

this aura okay great

DF Oh since that was it but that was an

action to activate the power right okay

so you're basically done

d/f it's your turn again you're the only

one that you can see besides the dragon

Oh God

don't don't do it don't do anything

stupid this is already stupid all of

they wanted by the way we're likewise

buried in the stone you know so at least

something good happen they're always

covered in rubble oh yeah there's a big

mound of rubble where your party used to

be it's cloud like on the same level as

us or is he like up on the wall when he

hit that when he hit the ground he's on

the ground so there's a big gash in the

wall now where it fell in on your

friends and Klaus is taking up that gash

with his presence and you can see his

head like looking down seeing you not

buried seeing everybody else buried is

there oh and I forgot to see if he

recharges his breath weapon going is

there a way for me to use that horn and

angle it in whatever way that I can just

actually blast all the rubble off of

everyone and maybe having a fly into his

face careful horn you can certainly try

it so is he is he like next to or within

other walls he next to the remain

of the broken wall not being okay the

entire wall didn't fall down but there's

like this big sort of u-shaped hole

where the wall used to be and there's a

piece of wall on one side of NPs okay on

the other I got you all right oh my god

no I don't think I can I hate you Chris

Perkins I know EF just basically like

after dodging like on his hands and

knees crawling for before finally

getting up to his feet is basically to

start running to the rubble and just

like just starts to panic trying to pick

the rubble up off of them okay is there

anybody in particular you're heading

toward based on your story of where they

were strict okay all right so make a

intelligence investigation check okay I

actually have some investigation

19

all right you believe you know where she

was buried and you begin to sort of

reach or rummage around in there and

pull some of the stuff away make a

strength athletics check to clear away

the stone above her I don't have that

[Applause]

yeah pretty sure you know where she is

other than very moving some small pieces

you're not able to get down to money all

right and you and the dragon says how

noble

[Music]

and says yeah let me help

[Music]

okay but now it is Strix astern strikes

you can't hear you can hear a little

like scratching rocks above your head

but it sounds like there might still be

tumbling down you can also hear the

dragon because it's a voice as heavy and

booming enough but you can't hear

anything else yeah I won't cloud myself

as you do da-fu ceased Rix's gaseous

cloud come up out of the stones around

you cool and I'll all materialize next

to next to DF is materializing in action

you know don't burn I think he does it

doesn't matter what you are but are you

cannot turn occupy the space of another

creature the target has resistance to

non magical damage has advantage on

strength dexterity and Constitution

saving throws that's good to know

I guess it's argot it sounds like it

ends when the concentration ends so yeah

so you can end the concentration on the

sparrow but I mean concentration on a

spell I'll just say I'll just stay a

cloud and just wave it DF it's time I

can do it my next I mean I'm probably

safer this way anyway so I'm just like

you're almost certainly safer this way

alright so at least know that Strix is

still alive mmhmm yeah you see her in

her cloudy state before you she can't

really talk in this form so yeah no it's

no action to end copy a concentration on

the spell so you could end it if you

want to alright I well I won't for now

okay I will if did he recognizes

everything's fine I'm just like I mean

it's not fine I mean it's not fine but I

definitely see the dragon so I'm screwed

do not be a cloud anymore okay I'm death

warded everyone my job's done you and

you can move 10 feet around so you're

pretty much right now

and let's see the wanti all right d/f

yeah

a snake crawls up out of the stone and

attempts to bite you

great

I still like a snake snake not a full of

snake man just meant to stay quarterback

and snake for him okay actually you

can't do that all I can do is all I can

do is climb out so you see the snake one

of the snake men but in snake form crawl

out by your feet okay

great they're alive paltin you feel a

snake brushing around your arm and neck

you in the dark underneath the rubble

and it is your turn palton okay trapped

under rubble with a snake that's

crawling over your body

great that's no one's nightmare or

anything I am NOT triggered you can tell

oh sorry man my son he doesn't he

doesn't talk and he's not moving right

now it's still he still could be good do

so I have no gauge of how far everyone

is or you have no line of sight to

anybody and no idea of how far the way

there you barely even know which way is

up and start all right I'm going to I

guess okay I just try to like climb out

you can that will require a strength

athletics check to basically push your

way out of the rubble is there something

else I can do that doesn't require

strength

Lenox not unless you can cast some sort

of spell under way just wiggle really

dexterously out of this predicament

okay can I persuade the rocks to get off

me is the persuasion Thunder Wave oh

that's that's very attention-grabbing we

already have his attention yeah that's

Ted's fair

oh yeah he probably knows where I am all

right could I Thunder way from where I

am

you can Thunder Wave underneath the

ground and it will radiate out in a

direction of your choice

oh so I wouldn't be able to like make

that like could that like push off could

it be from like like if you like you

want to try to use it to push rubble off

of you kind of dealing yeah yeah if I

could okay are you in the rear

yeah just be aware there may be people

in the rubble in front of you all right

I'll just I'll just try to push the

thing off with the spell or without

without I'll make an athletics check 16

you do not budge cool rocks I'm a little

chill here okay this is my life now bag

of nails you clam her up over the rubble

on the outside of the wall and gaze into

the maze and see the havoc that has been

wrought the party except for what

appears to be death and Strix buried

under a rubble and the dragon looming

above them Chris where the last round I

had the rope go by me and looking at

assessing the situation I don't have

anything left I have like you know my

spells are gone and I realized these

things well beyond me but I can sure as

hell help load that harpoon gun you

caught rope so

that rope because you took off and used

your feline agility

it's about sleep it's about 60 feet away

from you oh okay that's said I mean you

could try to call up to the ship and

have them kind of help you with the

distance a bit if you can get there yeah

I'll say you can see the three of them

are arguing at each other over this

goddamn Harper okay this vascularity but

all these double move to get back and

get up the damn room yeah you can you

can get back there and just sort of grab

onto the bottom of the ladder basic

skills just and that will be the end of

your turn thank you all right and just

looking at the bottom of the boat as it

turns around around all right the

balloon they finally get the harpoon

loaded and then they start to let's see

how all Andrea will make her way back to

the wheel tweed will cling on to the

edge of the rigging and look down to see

if bag of nails is on the ladder or not

Andy shouts he's on the liner and the

tiefling says great and climbs back into

the seat of the harpoon gun and they

will fine nothing they just missed yeah

and then the here the tiefling shall

bring us in closer and it is the dragons

turn oh well stripes being here

complicates things

the dragon will put his foot down on the

rubble and crunch a bunch of it into the

ground as he moves into the area and you

can't remember if anything was under

there or not and then he goes over to

where he knows paltin is and just

reaches in with a claw and scrapes away

a bunch of the rocks

paltin there's a sudden sound and all

the rocks over you are instantly pulled

off so that you're just staring up at

the dragon I like to imagine it was like

first really bright as my eyes adjust

I'm just like yeah oh yeah I saw the Sun

and like bits of ash falling from the

sky down upon you and then you just see

that everything come into focus and the

dragon and you feel its heat from its

nostrils each of which is big enough to

stuff a barrel in and that's all that it

does but it does remain vigilent to its

surroundings and evylyn you hear the

dragon's voice from underneath the rocks

you heard the scraping of rock away from

something not too far away from you you

felt the rock compact

dangerously close to you what do you do

I can't hear you as you can tell yes

gonna try to break out or under the

rocks Wow yeah make a straitjacket let

excited say is that a 1 or 20 on the

side it doesn't stress you see evylyn

explode out of the rocking pile the

flying off her and she's like got her

flying boots in a superhero stance and

she's just like like arms down like this

you know my god now that was your action

what else would you like to do I have a

bonus action to keel and from now that

you're out of the rocks you can see

Strix DF and in the in the sort of hole

of rocks paltin do I see Simon you see a

what Simon's wooden hand and hand sort

of grabbing on to Putin's leg do I have

any sense of how well he is he's it's

not moving he's just sort of very very

still right now and like from my point

of view everyone looks kind of like

battered but I can't tell that one

person's worse off than another okay I

guess I'm gonna give it to Simon my son

he gets stunt all right you see his

little hands flex encouraged okay and

then and then one of them sort of

detaches from Simon and does this yeah

good boy all right

and that's Evelyn's turn DF yeah the

dragon is looming high above paltin will

not high above paltin he's looming right

over paulten right now you heard the

words what do you do so has he lifted

paulten up or has he just like he

cleared the debris to reveal him he has

not touched palton he's just glaring

down at him and telling him this is his

last chance

polgár and Dragon will add let us yum

this little encounter as friends Paul

give it to him

Paul Tann you will not give it to him

the ring is actually controlling you I

call back my sex absolutely not

all right do you want anything else yeah

after you yeah paulten say absolutely

not and then you just you you both see

the Dragons brow become very dire very

serious flare I approach I actually make

my way to palton like not in like a

hurried kind of hostile sense but more

like showing the dragon that this I'm

more or less kind of giving in to his

demand and I basically make my weight up

palton and then like kind of help him up

to his feet okay

and as I'm helping him up to his feet I

slide this ring her office the ring off

his finger

okay Paul 10 you're not gonna want this

to happen so so so with it we think

controlling me it's I definitely won't

give it to the dragon that also includes

like actually the control specifically

was don't give it to the dragon right

but I can take it off right you can okay

or you can leave it or you can let it be

taken off do I notice that he's trying

to take it um you can't one character

can't technically rob another character

without some kind of intervening checks

so I will say that it's a sleight of

hand

check yes sleight of hand Shaq vs your

perception check to notice that he's

trying to do it first okay so make a

slight a hand check DF mm-hmm it's the

dexterity check if you don't have that

skill

and Paul can make a perception check

early in 1832 okay you don't notice that

he's trying to take whoa but again you

can do things to prevent the theft just

by you know running away or whatever but

actually it's still yes

turn right yeah it's still the offense

all you can really do Paul in this talk

this round I'm gonna tell them be like I

know I said this before but I have a

plan and then you do you see his hand

just sort of tighten like his fists kind

of tighten and resolve and you're like

just like we agree he can't have it

right no I can't

did cloud Seabee attempt to do this

that's a good question he needs to make

a perception check your old a32 yeah he

has a chance a chance of noticing he

rolled a 35 so yes all right so as I do

that I still clench my fist as if I have

the ring okay make a deception 16 okay

you don't think he is good wait he gets

five to that right now he doesn't it's

not safe all right

you you think that the dragon knows

where the ring is the earth despite your

attempts to fool it all right at the end

of your turn the dragon is going to use

a legendary action to inject itself at

the end of the s turn to use a wing

attack it will bring its wing down upon

UDF almost like a dividing line between

you and palton and attempt to knock you

away so I'd like you to make a dexterity

saving through do I get +5 from evilly

you do

[Applause]

31:31 makes it okay so you basically

duck under the wing as it comes down

between you and then slashes across to

send you careening across the palace and

when it passes you're still there yeah

and you stand up again and then the

dragon says oh I'm just like just one

moment with my associate to associate

please oh and that's where we'll stop

for tonight so the first person to act

next week will be Strix

and then paltin pluto Matthew will you

be able to join us next week for chance

okay okay if you can't please shoot the

dragon with a ballista it'll be rad

that's gonna burn actually you're not

gonna remind you should get a saving

throw right now to try to break this so

make a save yeah wisdom sleep okay a

seven twenty okay so you actually break

it so you are no longer under the effect

the rightful presence so you don't have

to worry about that next week

you just have to worry about the dragon

all right no okay
