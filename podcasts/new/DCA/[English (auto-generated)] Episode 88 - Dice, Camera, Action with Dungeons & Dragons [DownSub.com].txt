[Music]

hi and welcome to dice camera action a

D&D game with the waffle crew Jared was

having some sound issue so he's starting

up his machine again and hopefully will

join us momentarily while he does I can

give a brief recap of where we are the

waffle crew was stuck in the shadow fell

for a while and evylyn got torn apart by

a horrible horrible shadow fell monster

and her spirit got shunted into the soul

monger where she got sucked up into a

dead god being who got a bad case of

indigestion when evil and when

supernovae erupted into a Sun and her

soul ended up in heaven with a bunch of

other Souls that she had freed from the

soul monger and while she was there

enjoying the company of some children

and Morning Glory her horse with big

beautiful golden wings and generally

enjoying all this all the things that

haven't has to offer the rest of the

waffle crew was stuck in the shadow fell

trying to fight their way out and

encountered an aspect of death that was

trapped in this cave by the monster that

had killed

evylyn and through cunning and guile the

party tricked death and then allowed it

to escape after it told them how to use

a shadow crossing and they found

themselves in this shaft full of corpses

and Strix put two into way to escape

from this dumping shaft of corpses back

into the Material Plane and when she

polymorphed all of her friends into what

was it mice rats mice it was - yeah

everybody's a much everybody's a mouse

with juniper except Strix she hopped on

her broom and crossed over presumably

back into the Material Plane

emerging from a cauldron

inside a darkened chamber and then three

creatures that Strix recognized as hags

came out of the shadows to confront her

so at the moment everybody's in like

Strix is knapsack or whatever as a mouse

in a hat you know they're all peeking

out of her hat well your and Strix

you're still on your broom as you rise

up out of this cauldron you can see that

the sides of the cauldron are kind of

slick with blood and there's nothing

brewing in the cauldron now so you just

sort of pop out of this empty cauldron

hovering above it on your broom okay and

these three dark shapes step forth and

as I described them last week they are

all kind of these withered midnight

bluish black skinned hags you can see a

emerge you start to make out familiar

features that you saw Oh way back at the

start of the season oh we didn't forget

no no no and you can see that one of the

hags has glittering eyes and then you

realize it's because she's put two coins

over her eyes and she's also got ants

sort of crawling all over her skin and

the other one you can see is wearing

what looks like a string of chattering

children's teeth around her neck and she

thumps about on a heavy peg leg and the

last one as she emerges from darkness

she pulls a bag over her head so she's

just got a sack on her head right now

and what do you do Strix as they come

for

hello sisters and they say yeah yeah yes

welcome sister all right I'm rolling

with it the one with a bag also says

something but it's sort of muffled and

then sort of poking out through a hole

in the bag you see the head of a

cockerel sort of background and then

poking out through another hole is the

head of a viper oh so cute I love your

rooster friend yes and the the one with

the coins on her eyes says we put your

pieces of yourselves to good use but we

could use some more please give us more

hair hope fingernails we'll take a toe

give us toes

I like I'm myself and I have liked some

of those goblin fingers and I'm just

like you own one of these they kind of

come over to you and they kind of

surround you at that point and they take

a look at it I'm landed because when I

landed I was like Hello and so they they

look at the goblins and have a song

called please give us something of

yourself and your friends know that's

before you remember before I did not

like that you already have enough you

have enough he'll give you something in

exchange that's a deal

self-confidence and you know maybe maybe

app out and you just sort of pokes it

with a fingernail and do a thorough

search you nipper squeaks adder this

most human face she can Oh one

out of small holes but a terrier has

poked its head out and they're looking

Oh does it look like Milo no and one of

the other ones will try to dispel the

magic on DF nope unbreakable I'm

breakable that's right which means you

should just give me the resurrection

at the Vice what Sun scrutiny and then

they say he'll give us what we want and

on that is scary

one second a so just to catch you up

Jarrod okay

you have been turned from a mouse back

into a human and are in the company of

these hags yes I hate them and they want

while you are a mouse you heard them

negotiating with Strix they will give

you three things if you get them three

things what they want are pieces of each

of you and what you get in return

would be a scroll of resurrection mr.

Fox's spectacles and whatever the third

thing is that Strix can't remember it

was a book mr. Fox's book it's no it's

called something else it's like the

major

something something I don't know I can

see my memory

that's yeah I mean she was talking to a

mouse the whole time so the mouse

couldn't answer we used up all your hair

well yes I know I gave that to you

yes secondly it was a great gift thank

you we've put it to good use

yes good use but you want more of us cuz

we've used it all up again what if you

just take parts of me and not my friends

how will they take none of us you want a

piece from each of you so that we can

create

Shh don't tell them I'm sorry you can't

whisper in a company of us sisters one

for each of you and as a freebie we'll

let you leave here alive

now when you say piece of us just be

like a hair or like a finger or an arm

anything the more the better

should we just give him some hair I mean

honestly the three it strikes like poles

deaath and palton aside and is like just

so you know the three of them together

is really really holds up a big ear horn

as in like the three of them together

well literally we will die we cannot

fight them without evylyn we can't no

but if we cooperate we can get you Belen

back exactly so we just need to give me

some hair again okay hey I got here

alright alright so strict so like like a

halt like try and like muster up the

courage to walk up to them this like

she's like the translate the hag

translator yes if she's like we will

give you hair from each of us three

items but just one more thing to do do

not allow whatever you make with that

hair out of this this this this dungeon

why because they'll come and kill us

obviously and I don't want to die do you

want to die and they they sort of look

at each other and they say they have

their own little conspiratorial meeting

off to the side and they come to you and

they say you don't give us the hair

we'll give you the three things that you

want it was uh go our separate ways

yeah resurrection scroll mr. Fox's

spectacle and it was sure much cos

spellbook currently in the possession of

mr. Fox

oh very easy none of this is easy

they're going to make clones of us and

then they're going to send the clones

after us and they're gonna be worse than

I suppose and so what makes you say that

well a snake person told us that they

were doubles of us wandering around and

I accidentally gave you the hair so I'm

pretty sure they're out there somewhere

ha ha ha but that's fine let's cut to

let us let us leave the sanctuary of the

hags for a moment Thank You arey yeah

and travel a little ways off to a city

of Port lions aru and see what the other

Strix the other paulten and the other DF

are up to and at this point I would like

to give away the DM chair to Ana all

right I have no idea what I'm doing I

give the total of like four so I'm

totally qualified now is what Chris

thinks yep I would say you guys are

probably wandering the market you're

checking out the sights and smells

and by checking out I mean probably like

sneering at because you guys are pretty

evil I think it's probably important to

know like what you look like starting

with Jared what is was evildea look like

okay evildea much less scars actually

looks his actual age 28 29 so he doesn't

look like a young baby instead of his

standard clothing everything he's

obtained has been from point nine iron

Xaro and salt so he's a little more

dressed for the weather so he's got like

a black leather half vests that is like

completely open and basically covers

down comes down to like half his chest

and you just bear underneath it

he's got slightly beg year darker pants

with with brown thigh high boots like

it's all the way up there stringed up

the side and he's got a well he's got

like a a we'll say i got like a green

sash going around him but use that to

cover up all of his tools and things his

he still has a sword like very much

plainly there but he's got a such kind

of covering a lot of that and he he

walks around with a much more of a

grimace and an attitude and not so much

scanning everything around them for

awareness but more shifty-eyed and

trying to make sure no one is seeing him

does his hair fall into his eyes a

little bit

oh definitely does he have facial hair

at all uh well say I'll say no all right

still clean-shaven

yeah baby face but not baby attitude

yeah

and yeah every now and then like a

string of hair disconnected falls down

from his face and just like dangles

brother yeah he knows it's there but he

likes it

what about Strix so this is Strix pre

burrow via 50 years so this is back to

being young looking strikes with like

horns mmm and she's just I just imagine

her obviously again like Jared said

they've only been in Schultz oh she's

probably just got like like weird like

plant matter instead of robes it's like

gross like whatever she could find on

the street maybe some like just what

literally whatever scene when she's

disgusting like she has no old dinosaur

poop and like exactly no she is

disgusting like I would say that even

like her hair is so mad at and

disgusting it's like slicked back words

like it's like backwards with her orange

sticking out so she just has it like

slicked backwards so you can see her

like how their ears are pointed which

normally you can't even see and her tail

is was out not hidden and she has long

black claws like and just parts of her

just like rotten like like part I

imagine like part of her head is just

like like just mold growing on her like

she does not care about herself at all

and she's just like feral like looking

around less like like she has no one has

been kind to this creature in her entire

life

and she doesn't understand the kindness

like her friends taught her when in a

waffle crew palton what do you look like

hmm so evil palton is he still got a he

still got like a cape cloak thing going

on but instead of purple it is black

under that he has a kind of like a white

button shirt that's under a red vest

he's uh he's a little little on the pale

side let me finish his here's like long

and it's like black and slicked back

he's also sitting in like this fancy

restaurant

has he had he had like plastic fangs or

something or had his teeth elongated

somehow well the mouth is closed in this

picture so it's hard I'm gonna say

normal teeth and yep so let's go that

[Laughter]

you're with the party describe yourself

so I am the hags assistant um pox and I

am an imp so I am a cat sized devil with

pointy horns very spindly thin body with

bat wings and a scorpion tail and I

brought with me there we go

and um pox has two things one he holds

an eyeball in one hand and occasionally

just sort of points it at different

things almost like he wants somebody to

he wants the eye to see things so he's

got this varnished eye that he holds on

to and just sort of points everywhere to

he's given to one of you a large black

body bag mine I'll take it mine right so

death has got the the big sack of evil I

tell ya is this black it's this matte

black bag that when you put it over a

living or dead evil person it transports

them to the hag's all right

the hags have made it very clear that

they expect you to fill this with as

many people as you possibly can because

they are hungry and that is your own

little people if you put anybody who

isn't people in the bag they don't go

anywhere they're just stuck in the bag

mm-hmm you did say alive or dead right

correct excellent yes

and most of the time you don't see um

pox because he's invisible when he's not

invisible he's often in the form of a

rat a raven or a spider so I'm gonna say

he's a rat around Strix when he pushes

on Strix

he's a raven when he perches on paltin

and he is a spider when he perches on DF

oh my god this is so creepy I love it

does he talk to the characters Chris Oh

luli whenever if they go astray or they

you know shirk their duties he will he

will constantly remind them of their

great mission goal which is to deliver

evil people to the hags clutches yeah

and you guys have actually been really

shirking your duties lately kinda got

caught up in shopping for your outfits

and you didn't really so that the hags

told you if you didn't get someone evil

right away they were gonna get so angry

that they you would regret it and they

kind of implied that you might be the

next snack have the hags been giving us

specific targets like a hit list or we

just expect to find whoever we kind of

finding however you can how dare you

think they have time to identify who do

you think you are sorry I just thought

maybe they would make it easy on us

since we're doing everything for them

have we been do we already have somewhat

of like a rapport with um pox or yeah I

sort of assumed that he's been following

you around and ever since you kind of

got loose and since you guys are

hovering around third level you probably

started off at first level and you've

actually gotten this far just by bagging

evil malefactors in the city and we

probably aren't like best of buds with

him right that's up to you okay he

doesn't seem interested in doing

anything but the hags service all right

well we're in port and irons are oh they

can't be that hard to find someone

that's evil

mm-hmm right now you're hanging out like

I said you're kind of in a market

there's a lot of market stalls people

are trying to sell their wares they're

calling to you trying to get you to buy

stuff there's a dinosaur here or there

lumbering through the street as a beast

of burden or you know one of the fancy

racing dinosaurs kind of showing off

their colors you know there are other

places around port nines are you that

might have you know higher

concentrations of crime than here but

this is kind of where you ended up today

all right

within the the busy markets I'm just

going to actually be looking around do

want to make sure no one's looking at me

and to see if just based on my

experience if I happen does spot anyone

who's doing some petty theft either like

pickpocketing things or trying to lift

things from the different stalls or

whatever and I'll just be keeping an eye

out for that as easy targets roll a

perception check all right my first evil

role hold on I gotta use my level three

sheets that's right remember what held

our things are I bone assist 9 you know

what you cannot tell that anyone here is

doing anything other than what they

exactly seem to be doing you know why

that's because a single strand of hair

yes and I was just admiring that think

about how I looked from the outside

looking at looking for like a reflecting

pool or something yeah I'm just like oh

staring in a rain barrel I'm hungry so

I'm gonna go look for an animal to kill

and eat with my hands okay I want one of

those lizards all right to see if you

can catch one

I got an 18 you use like you're just

standing there you look down you see one

and you just snack it and yeah and I've

just I just bite its head off right in

the middle of the street and I'm just

like looking around for people doing bad

things in the middle of the street are

we am i near DF right now or are we kind

of like doing our own thing

oh you're all together in a group you're

all rolling together as she's like

biting the head off a lizard I like kind

of lean over death I'm like you know if

we have to crunch on time we could just

throw her in oh I've thought of that all

right cool and he'll kind of look over

at evil palms kind of my like mm-hmm

we got a good alignment yeah you know if

we need to do now oh yeah yeah got for

each other oh yeah absolutely

mm-hmm yeah yeah miss tricks are you

used to this kind of behavior like do

you care at all I don't care at all no

no strikes doesn't care she just is

looking for either snacks to eat as in

like animals or just it's like doing

whatever the hags tell her to do because

the hags probably give her more animals

to eat you said you were looking around

for people doing evil right you roll a

perception check yeah I am I mean as I'm

like munching again on this animal

that's you actually I probably just have

like a cataract in one eye or something

like messed up ones like yeah um okay so

we're we're kind of in like a it's

relatively populated area like there's

people around and stuff

okay I'm just like no one's doing

anything

Oh idea and I'm gonna cast crown of

madness on just some the nearest Rando

yeah sure is selling he's selling fish

he's a fishmonger perfect selfish I

think they do anyway he's holding up a

fish and he's like fresh tilapia and I'm

just gonna have him like start like

beating people with fish and he just

turns to his his stall mate who was you

know stalking the fish and back and just

starts

backing him over the head with the fish

and the other guy's evil paltin poison

is like look he's attacking that

innocent citizen with fish something

must be done about this Oh rats talking

like every time I talk she just did

scared it says I think they're gonna put

you in the bag if you keep acting weird

I'll push you in the bag all right

sounds good

perfect now there's chaos now we wait

for someone to take advantage this chaos

and we get them that's very smart are

you in spider form right now or Raven

I'll say I'll say right now I will

switch from being a rat on strictest

shoulder to a spider on yours so I'll

ratchet alright so is that what you guys

are doing just standing watching saying

I'm saying if everybody takes advantage

of the chaos can I try to perceive if

someone is being evil now cool that is a

sick 9 about that one like thick jacket

that none of you could afford you know

time passes you're just kind of like oh

man but you know it doesn't take too

much perception because you guys are

kind of the only people looking for

anything other than this guy slapping a

guy with the fish some people are kind

of crowded around laughing some people

are really concerned some are pointing

at the crown of madness and whispering

some a couple like spellcasters seem to

be looking on with like interest and

wanting to learn but you see as this is

happening a small a young girl probably

about eight years old kind of sneaked up

she's wearing rags and she kind of like

peers over the fishmongers stall grabs a

fish and starts running away take her

out

on it rinse forward after this

eight-year-old girl no strict so misty

step in front of her what forever be

like I got her first evil is still evil

she she's like squirming she's like and

she just she can't really she doesn't

seem to be able to talk she's so scared

of strix

her in her bag she tries to give back

the fish she's like but this time death

has I caught up he started pre-treating

the bag and pulls it open kneels down

and looks at her and says like hasn't

even ever taught you that stealing is

wrong it'll kind of like start bringing

the bag over and as he's doing this and

look over at the spider and just be like

live ones are worth more right

and just we'll just kind of shove her

down into this okay great she um she

does in fact disappear once you put the

bag on top and then like a magic trick

just picks up the bag against that

performance check and people throw money

at you let's check to see how cool I'm

using my evil Denise oh no oh my god

what why 19 how much actually tricks

insulting you guys are so impressed that

like if ever there was a question that

des was the leader of your group that

question is over now like that you just

proved his dog his bag flourish was like

please don't put me in the bag

I'll just cooperate and I won't I

oh my god is still slapping the other

guy with the fish that's fine covered in

scales and stuff the guy with the fish

is crying he doesn't know what's going

on I was just like yeah cool alright

well we just captured a live one that's

gotta be worth something

Strix mark that down somewhere and she

just like take

so like knife and just writes notes on

her arms like there you go draws a

little girl stick figure on her arm on

top of her arm she's like I think we

have seven and a half on box is that

good or do we need more he says one a

day it's pretty good oh good so ragazza

we take the afternoon off cool sounds

good to me

all right Strix paulten let's go let's

go down to the docks I hear there some

good good ale down there good good docks

down there yeah sure that's whatever you

want which docks are you going to go to

there's the ones that are like the

official very well regulated city docks

and those are called the Harbor Ward but

then there's another one which name I

forgot maybe Chris remembers but it's

the other docks that like no but it's

not very highly regulated it's kind of

where like a lot of smugglers go the

other dogs mm-hmm the shady ones even if

you go to docks yeah we're going to the

shady docks okay I'm more at home there

all right you head down to the docks

leaving behind the poor fishmonger who

is slapping his friend about how long

does he continue doing that fall to

[Laughter]

white probably what he broke a

concentration on the spell yeah yeah

concentrate on that entire way yeah

until you walk away all right as you

leave the fishmonger stop seeps crying

and embracing his friend who's probably

permanently scarred by fish is sweet but

literally and figuratively yep

so the docks in the warehouse district

is basically where the CD okay

warehouse district it is so you head on

down there to the docks and you're

looking for a place to grab a grab a

pint yes starting with that oh I also

would just like to set something on fire

on the way there okay what kind of thing

you want to set on fire

an Allosaurus says that I find the

nearest Allosaurus and like set its

saddle on fire all right so you're

walking you know winding your way down

to the docks away from from the market

and you notice Allosaurus you just flick

fire onto its saddle it immediately

catches the Allosaurus turns to you in a

fury and tries to maul you well you know

you set it on fire so it is - it's a

claw you Susan it's clearly coming

towards strikes deathlike gets out of

the way it actually what's your armor

class right now it would be 14 I believe

all right if I cast mage armor so 12

yeah it totally misses you because it

was caught by surprise it just kind of

rears up and tries to call you and

misses I just missed you step away and

run ok so everyone's just trying to

disengage yes all right

DF doing the whole Oh where's this not

such a I better get out of here oh my

god hair in his face and thigh high

boots totally as an evil the owners of

the auto store this is actually like a

really fancy racing Allosaurus that they

were kind of like preening you know and

so all three of the owners of this

Allosaurus see you guys running away and

kind of cackling and thinking you're

cute and they're like you know stop and

they start running after you one of them

mounts the Allosaurus in the saddle and

they try to catch you can we get hide in

a building or something I mean you can

try am i being chased by one on the

dinosaur or one of the others on for it

oh that's true you went the other way

from Strix you didn't okay

so strict I imagine went down the road

and you kind of ducked between some

buildings yes there definitely chasing

Strix all of them cuz she set it on fire

Oh all three are chasing her yeah so

that's fine like SS be chased away look

at the ethem like shakey go and then

this is ready going I am magic

if paltin if you're close enough I'll

quickly say not or trouble but I

wouldn't mind a little extra coin and

then death will quickly use second-story

work ability to quickly scale in between

the buildings sitting on top of the

rooftops and use that to chase the

intent of being able to leap from the

rooftop and my Assassin's Creed one of

them oh okay uh let's see are you you're

faster than they are I would assume

what's your speed I can use cutting

action to - right

so the outsources speed is 60 feet and I

think your speed is 30 feet and you

would double it with that right yeah

it's so if I - I keep off the Allosaurus

but I'm gonna start with one of the

dudes on foot okay one of them yeah the

dudes on foot are significantly behind

the guy on the Allosaurus so you can you

can Assassin's Creed down on to them I

guess we should roll initiative at this

point let's do that okay all right I

already sticking with my evil die yeah

that's pretty good 17 14 I got an 11 I

was using my tomb of anihilation dice

that's been my evil dice alright I'm

PAC's world a8 okay unbox is still with

dia yeah Oh perfect oh yeah there's a

box have like combat abilities that

we're aware of Chris oh yeah he's got

one basically and that is when he is

he's got a sting so he can use his

scorpion tail to sting people and he

likes to do it he likes to turn

invisible first and then go sting them

okay

alright alright so um the the dudes that

were running are just running and

focused on Strix and they're not able to

catch up with her because her speed I

think is the same as as theirs and

they're lagging behind this Allosaurus

but the right there the dinosaur

actually is able to catch up to Strix

and the dinosaur again tries to actually

he's going to try to bite Strix this

time and do um Chris like that time it

does hit let's see how much damage okay

I was drunk with power

alright so that's gonna do twelve

piercing damage okay that's a lot I'm

strolling hey I'm fine yeah then it is

the dude on the Allosaurus is turned but

he doesn't have any weapons so he just

kind of shakes his fist at you and yo

I'm not lucky I'm still running and just

like I also imagine for some reason evil

strikes like runs on all fours runs like

a total gremlin just totally feral yeah

yeah exactly

all right Diaz it's your turn next okay

at this point am i are down the rooftops

and caught up to them or time yeah

connection to - to get up there and then

make the leaping attack onto him or

whatever uh let's see you you started

following significantly after they

started chasing her because you had that

power with Politan so I think you could

cutting action - to get like caught up

with them but you couldn't you couldn't

catch them and attack them on this turn

okay yeah if there's no like running and

moving they yeah that's like up on the

rooftops

and then what I'll do is so do this yet

still has a short sword at his side we

see him reach back both hands underneath

his sash and actually pull out two

daggers as you like continues to sprint

forward roll another performance check

[Laughter]

ten it looks kind of cool all right not

now as much twirling or flourishing

there but it's just a little yeah I mean

you may have tried to make it look cool

but nobody noticed it is pretty simply

just went from Reverse get grip and like

flip them so they're both facing forward

who was evil D of trying to impress like

the Allosaurus

all right palton you're next so he sees

all this going on he kind of you kind of

like preps up and just kind of all right

and he opens up one side of his coat and

he reaches in and he pulls out a pocket

watch and looks at it and just goes and

then just puts it away and then maybe

find somewhere to like sit it's funny

the alleyway that you ducked into it

actually has one of those like really

cute hipster alley bars in it you know

outdoor seating did I see that yeah I'm

just like oh I'm just like grab a table

you don't see waitstaff yet but like you

know you sat down I'm sure they'll

notice you in a second

I'm gonna sit do I so do I see any

waitstaff no they're all inside right

now oh there's no like windows or

anything I mean yeah actually once you

look through the window you can see

there's someone inside like serving a

drink right inside the window I'm just

like looking at I'm just like no all

right now that brings us to Strix

I'm still running yep but I would like

to misty step again if I could just like

get away okay I need to like a roof

something all right you missed you step

is it to the same roof that dia is

running along or yeah being probably

because I just see him as CAD and cannon

fodder I'll just go up there like

alright Strix appears right next to dia

it seems unexcited about this one of the

chasing dudes who was chasing Strix

behind the dinosaur it's now his turn he

sees her misty step and stops and looks

around can't seem to figure out where

she went

but he sees that she's no longer in

front of them so he stops I'm PAC's it's

your turn

alright so how far am i away from the

nearest guy if I'm still attached to

death as a spider you're so if like

here's the street you're running death

is on the rooftop even with the guys who

are running so probably like I don't

know 20 feet away okay yeah I'd like to

spider leap onto his face cool

so an alien face hugger grab and and the

yeah exactly so this is the spider leaps

off the roof down on him

and tries to bite him in the face okay

and how does that go let me see

seventeen on the die plus five is a

twenty-two alright yeah that definitely

hits the dude space alright gotta break

out a d4 here I bite him for five points

of damage

hey got him his face fiercely and he's

screaming and falls to his knees trying

to rip the spider off of it and he has

to make a constitution say we throw

against poison cool this is some like

generic as dude to sound like DC oh it's

a deep mighty DC of eleven he has to be

definitely he beats that he's a sturdy

dude okay so he takes half damage from

the poison which is another five Oh

another five yeah God so Jesus Christ

for a moment screaming and then goes

I'll finish the finish dressing I'm

moved by just sort of scuttling off into

a dark corner the other dude who was

running next to him notices that happen

to his friend and he's not I thought he

would be frightened but he's not it's

actually he looks a lot like John Cena

you hear that in the distance like a

trumpet but yeah he doesn't look afraid

he looks pissed off and so now he's

searching around for four who did that

and I think he noticed the spider so

he's he's like trumping after that

spider but we'll see what happens next

up is uh actually it's that dude's turn

so he's chasing the spider if you're

hiding I have to role perception against

your stealth okay correct yeah although

I'm not I didn't technically make a

stealth check to hide so I might not in

fact be hiding really so I was just

crawling away to get into a dark spot

doesn't mean you can't see me I have to

use an action if I actually want to try

to hide from it so he totally sees you

and he's coming toward you to try to

stomp you he wants all right rider I

think that for stomping is it just like

a yes it's just basically his strength

bonus attitude he manages to stomp you

and my armor class is 13 yeah actually

he stops okay and look up the last thing

you see are Joris right so the good news

is is that I take half damage from non

magical weapons that aren't made of

silver so unless he's wearing his silver

typically an unarmed attack is one plus

your strength bonus you don't even have

to roll it's just one point of damage

plus your strength okay so I think his

strength bonus is two so there you go he

took three points

well one

- at one point he stomps this

indestructible spider just kill this

friend stop and he goes flat and then as

soon as he takes his hand up it goes

John Cena looks shocked and angry

alright not John Cena I mean schmagina

awesome so Monch Mina has gone how it's

des turn again great leaping double stab

sneak attack Mina oh yeah absolutely

now you stopped moving like an idiot I'm

coming right down on them okay cool how

does that go

this shadow gets bigger and bigger and

bigger on half em until it's like III

leap off but there's like a four flip

and everything is just coming down and

like a like a pair of shears just both

coming in right into where the collar

bones is where I'm aiming and so that my

feet land on his back so flat down to

the ground as my blades enter in

provided I hit alright so since I am I

am doing dual wielding with this so I

guess I should get two attacks first one

is after bonus 17 yeah okay good and

this the second one is 16 so I imagine

both hit yes they do great so boulders

mm-hmm okay so and you have an ally yep

so I got that's the all we have to do

sneak attacks well that's pretty good

though uh total damage is PC 911 18

meter goes and falls to the ground

actually falls to his knees and then

straight forward and da I imagine since

you're like kneeling on his back you

just end up kneeling looking super cool

oh yeah exactly

Jack as he's facedown on the ground and

then I'll look over at unpacks and I'll

say don't recall asking for your help

I will just stare back at him like a

spider that I am I don't even have a

spider finger to give you one yeah all

right so all that's left now is the dude

riding the Allosaurus death is now down

on the road Colton's way back there at

the cafe or the bar but it is Paulson's

no it's the dinosaurs turn the dinosaur

is still pissed but not smart enough to

figure out where the person it was

chasing went so it's standing still

facing the same direction just kind of

like yeah yeah not knowing what happened

now it's Paulson's turn you snapped at

the weights now they did not imagine

there's like this this sneak attack

flipping rogue killing stuff being a

badass and then just like camera cuts

over he's just like hello I've been

seeing it for like two minutes now okay

can I get a menu he is ten times more

evil than the rest of us he's also just

like yelling at the window even though

no one is outside and no one hears him

eventually does the waitress perceive

you actually she's like an amazing

waitress she notices you're out there

kind of gives you this look poke like

leans out the door and it's like um sir

we're not seating out here say well

that's interesting because I bit i've

sat out here for again two minutes now

can I get a menu Strix wait I didn't

take a real action I I'm going to for

her manager

I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna okay Carol

and intimidation okay

seventeen all right so I'm just like so

as soon as she says like we're not

seeing out here I'm just like what's

your name

Marsha okay Marsha I'm gonna need

someone who can actually help me to come

out here so if you go ahead and stop

wasting my time and then figure out

who's actually competent and sending

them that would be awesome thank you

otherwise you don't want to know who you

were starting to piss off got it thank

you

like you have intimidated Marsha I can't

handle this kind of evil I've ever

worked in service we saw yeah yeah I

can't handle this all right now it's

strict sister okay um yeah so strict

swatched evildea takedown this person

launched Mena mm-hm and she'll just like

I guess I guess I'll just go down there

way I can get down from the roof without

misty stepping probably yeah I think you

can climb down I mean it's it's jolt

there's all sorts of like okay I will

uh none grace non gracefully stumble

myself down through like maybe roll on

an awning and like a clot awning and get

to the ground and the dead body of SHM

on shmita I'm just going to start taking

its fingers off okay um I would say with

your action you can at least take like a

whole hand of fingers okay I'll just

take his hand off okay cool so I have

his hand now you have the hand that

seems to look like the hand of John Cena

yeah and I'm just holding it I hold it I

see him I just hold it up say like

evildea that I'm like hand okay cool

now let's see you killed that dude yep

okay that dudes dead um pox it's your

turn so the only quote-unquote the

dinosaur who's kind of off away from us

now and it's Ryder

mm-hmm okay I will turn into a raven and

fly off to make sure paltin still alive

okay

he's significantly far back there I

think

what's your speed so I can fly let's see

60 feet is a Raven monitor Oh easy yeah

you can you get two you get two palton

okay then I'll just land on I'll perch

on a railing or something nearby and

he's probably seen me in this for me

before so I see him I'm just like you

want to talk about evil let's talk about

the food industry this is ridiculous I'm

just like looking around for a french

fry you don't see a French fry but you

do see worm oh okay yeah that that worms

gonna be my target next round

great awesome all right and now it is

the dude on the dinosaurs turn and he

let's see if he knows yep he actually as

he's turning in the saddle looking

around he sees you guys behind him with

the dead bodies of his two friends and

he's like Rupert go talking to the

dinosaur he he starts to turn the

dinosaur around to face you so after he

like turns and I actually locks eyes

with dfd if so like daggers in his

friend just kind of looks off Battlement

gives them one of these no no just real

like okay it's a bring it on

yeah that's convenient because no

actually it's the dinos turn next

so the Dino starts charging at you and

easily can make it back to you death

within its turn mm-hmm and because

you're you're daring it with your

it goes for you first and tries to bite

you all right what's your armor class 15

it's I don't know why I think maybe it

like tries to stop too fast and it

doesn't quite make it so it tries to

bite you but ends up like just kind of

ripping John Cena's shirt I'm too fast

yeah a little bit it just snaps right

behind you and totally misses you

that means it's your turn next year

right in the same smooth motion as I

dodge the dinosaur a baa-baa bite from

leaping off to the side I do an entire

back spin and as it come out the dagger

my right hand is flung out of my hand

and will go into the rider oh okay

rolled a hit this is death having a

dinosaur mount I can tell 16 yep you hit

me how much damage that's a good

question is it just dagger damage I

don't know how thursdaya I'll cross the

strict scorer sneak attack I would say

probably ending right next to you yeah

yeah she's she stole she's got her hand

she's just waving the hand around like

this mm-hmm

all right what do you think sneaky duck

is or no yes

hell yeah that roll sucked so did that

eight total eight yes the dagger goes

wide oh no that's that's eight for

damage oh wait for damage you're I'm

sorry on the rider yes kidding it's it

sticks into the riders uh died and blood

starts pouring out but he's still

staying on the dinosaur he looks looks

pretty bad he's in a bad way uh camera

goes back to palton you notice the Raven

stopped by you you intimidated Marsha uh

she seemed to run in you see someone's

coming out as someone else anything you

want to do before they they show up now

that you see the Raven

no-nothing in regards to the Raven I see

I'm just like alright so this this huge

dude comes walking out he's got like

this stained apron shaved head he's kind

of he's got a grimy dish towel and he's

kind of wiping his hands does he look

like The Undertaker or maybe Sheamus or

[Music]

its smokes Mogan okay handlebar mustache

you'd expect that he had long hair I

don't know why he had a shaved head

something something must have comes out

and says hey brother and he just kind of

stares at you like what you're gonna do

when small tow mania runs wild on you

[Laughter]

Jesus Christ okay as I re are you them

manager here yeah okay see like so I

don't know what kind of establishment

you think you're running here but um

whether you like it or not the whole

customer is always right trope

definitely abide by it because you never

know who's who's gonna walk in and you

never know who might have some bad

things to say about it down the road if

you were to not accommodate all I wanted

to do is sit outside and have a nice

drink maybe maybe get some food and and

you can't even do that like what what

exactly are you doing here tell me what

what do you do here role of persuasion

check evil Paulson is just a Yelp

reviewer mmm

fifteen mr. mr. Hogan was seeming like

ready to throw you out but as you're

talking he's kind of like you know why

he's kind of nodding and he's like kind

of starting to understand it Chris how

does mr. Hogan who feels like oh gosh

hmm I'm gonna take that back to the

management it's like thank you you tell

the higher-ups ate your vitamins what

whatever anyway

if you could bring me whatever the

strongest thing you got behind the bar

is in there that would that would make

all these problems go away good sir all

right he nods he also leaves the plate

of spaghetti that he was making for you

I was like on the house says on the

house and then turns around and goes to

get you a drink anything else I think

that's your whole I would assume that's

your whole action you Christmas you sure

yeah

all right this works all right great

strix it's your turn now all right um

dinosaur guys still there

yeah dinosaur guy tried to bite dia

well dinosaur tried to be idea guy got

daggered on the side deaath is just

standing there giving his bring it on

look right does does the dinosaur look

interested in my hand

uh no it's completely looking it's

completely okay yeah okay guy on top of

the dinosaur though we're trying to get

him yeah okay um well I searched even

Strix doesn't really care about that she

just wants to get more pieces off of

people so she's just gonna magic missle

the guy on top of a dinosaur and she's

just like yeah does like really scary

like magic

you're muted Anna I'm sorry what does it

do I think I get three missiles three

well if you're just using a first-level

spell you get three yeah all right so it

does seven points damage yeah take that

he falls off the dinosaur in a crumpled

heap on the ground the dinosaur now has

no rider but it has a saddle and bridle

on and looks a little bit confused at

feeling the loss of weight on its back

yeah and strict's will also look like I

got that it's not yours dear looks

visibly agitated then she'll wipe a

dirty hand on him like that

alright strix and Diaz are having a

little spat unbox what do you do after

seeing all this unfold I'll skip the

worm and start sucking up spaghetti lady

in the spaghetti I don't think

that it can I think it has to like

that'll work I'm just sayin like poke

them off all right like you have your

work I'll sort of dance on the other

side of the bowl and brandish my wings

threatening Li you see with my 15 also

15 for the rest of your turn and no one

eats bummer

alright next up is the dinosaur it still

is going after DSO it tries to take one

more bite of DF and it rolls really well

your armor cost was 15 yeah yeah it it

bites you and it does

do you have any any evasion type thing I

know you can do those fancy things

uncanny nope uh little bit oh geez I'm

ready to take his hands it is your turn

next yes

it bit me you said yeah damn

alright body alright I'm just gonna take

the other dagger that's still in my hand

and just give it a quick stab near

nearly what wants hind legs in the hopes

like that pain will make him want to run

away from it just in hopes of like just

making them like sprint down the

alleyway and away from us hmm just okay

run away how much damage does that do

let me see if I let me see if I can stab

me first

oh that's not good that isn't it yeah

you you're heading back there to stab

him but you just overshoot some kind of

like slip and fall and and and don't hit

him at all but he laughs at him you run

that way okay but then I'll stay on my

ground okay is you palton your your

standoff has ended nobody scared anybody

and you still have spaghetti and

actually in the meantime Marsha comes

back out glaring at you but leaves you a

jar like a mason glass a mason jar glass

you know like a really hipster one of

moonshine uh as she leaves it like

before hey I'm just gonna be like wait

it's like I just want to say

that I know you I know it's tough for

you in a position you're in and I just I

really hope I really hope you can see

past because that's not who I really am

I'm gonna put on the eyes of Charming

and give like a little wink eyes I'm

charming totally yeah well wearing them

you can expend one huh as an action cast

the charm person spell which is a save

DC 13 okay so I will do i I want to

charm this person for free drinks more

free drinks all right walks back over to

you picks up the mason glass spits in it

sets it down and walks away ah I think

that was evil bad I see that and then I

look at the rave I'm just like that

probably qualifies right all right

that would be the end of Fulton Stern

Strix it's now your turn

the Allosaurus is seems to be focused on

DF but is alive and well has been trying

to bite him you have a hand in your hand

well I'm gonna I still have plenty of

misty steps left so I'm gonna go ahead

and step on top of or on the Allosaurus

on the saddle oh okay

do you have I mean I know normal Strix

has dinosaur handling experience but

does evil Strix oh not at all

none

although animal handling is a skill yeah

I don't have any provisions oh but I can

roll to try an animal handle this diet

is that what you're trying to do or yes

I'm trying to

- I'm trying to ride it okay cool

roll animal handling oh wow nineteen

whoa nice you straight somewhere in your

innate being you can just like commune

with dinosaur as you take the reins the

dinosaur kind of settles into a like ok

I know where I'm supposed to go and what

I'm supposed to do and just kind of

seems to like feels safer and secure now

you have complete control of his house

Soros amazing I just like look straight

and evil D if and I'm like I will take

over everything in this town it takes

like arrange it so that it just goes

shopping into the market trample

everyone just trample them ok

throwing throwing fire bolts like contra

Firebolts intense just on merch unboxing

palton you guys are palton you have this

mason jar to your mouth because you

decided to drink it anyway but as you

you you see a dinosaur go stomping by

and a little heap of garbage spewing

fireballs in kappa yes it's literally

like he sees it Astrix leaves death

having like just been injured how it

works down as wound a little bit and he

does one of these even though like

there's like there's like no one around

like one of these and a strand of hair

still falls down afterwards and then

he's going to start looting the two

dudes he just killed looking for

especially money any kind of money or

anything that you could find useful is

what he's looking for

alright uh this was like let's see yeah

alright so the first guy you loot

the one who was not John Cena yeah he

has like I don't know five silver pieces

and a little carved a little carved

dinosaur that looks like it might have

been a toy for like a child okay and

also a raptor tooth the John Cena guy

has a pouch with 20 gold pieces in it oh

yes picture of a really attractive

tiefling lady and a emerald alright and

then the guy who fell off the dinosaur

has a letter saying that he needs to

return the frog or else and he also has

and he has a ball of string okay

that letter mm-hmm just tear it up

alright and then I'll take out the the

bag and try to put him in and see if any

of them go hmm okay why don't was a frog

kidnapped her so yeah kidnapper actually

you put him in and nothing happens

turns out he's a really good guy oh I

was trying to dispose of it potties yeah

well that guy it doesn't go anywhere do

you try to do the next one yeah john

cena instantly disappeared oh and the

other guy his other seems to be you know

like he was the boss and these were his

two kind of employees the other one

doesn't go either only only john cena

unfortunately right good enough for me

yeah that was the dice by the way

nothing against John Cena I just want it

to be clear okay alright so strict

strict you're just going through the

market spewing magic missiles everywhere

yeah fire bike yeah yeah fire bolts

barbed air bolts just trying to do as

much damage as as possible

okay I'm showing the world my source or

a prowess and that it is my birthright

to become the most powerful sorcerer in

the world okay

let's see you start stomping through the

marketplace people scream and flee in

either direction you set fire to the

fishmongers cart as well as a jewelry

shop and a place that sells falafel yeah

great and I'm yelling and I'm the most

powerful sorcerer in the world their

whole time all of you Burks will die

under my hand and I'm just like throwing

fire everywhere and cackling okay um the

dinosaur seems like at first it's

getting a little shot fire shy but your

animal handling skills seem to be

keeping it under control for now but it

seems a little worried but it continues

stomping for you other guards in the

city great great I'm just gonna as long

as I don't see them I'm just gonna keep

this is why you went to the warehouse

district yeah I'm gonna keep living my

my grand destiny so is is uh those deals

with the bag out of sight yeah okay

which house like Edison bulb lights

strung up there's like an indie band

playing how how is my spaghetti mmm good

question it's good it's actually the

best spaghetti you've ever had

all right and what about the moonshine

good question it's horrible

it tastes like rubbing alcohol except

that someone spit in it

Thanks mmm just like just like mom used

to make wait no I don't have a mom

that's right okay it's like oh yeah just

like oh yeah spitting and stuff I'm just

like yeah just like home mom used to

make

[Laughter]

I'm going to just carry on with my meal

and my moonshine and just try and enjoy

myself unbox since DF is putting things

in the bag and you have the eye that's

communicating with the hag do they send

any messages or do you know that death

is putting these people in the bags or

anything from the head I can only see I

can't see they can see through the eye

but I can't and there's no sound so if

they're just visually seeing paltin

drinking spit laced moonshine and do i

know about the eye yeah like how it

works okay and I see the eye and like

well I mean I'm just like while he does

that I'm gonna sort of fly off and land

on marsha shoulder inside the restaurant

and then when she turns to look at me

i'm gonna pluck her eye out all right

that's gonna be a total of fifteen okay

okay so i know we don't use called shots

i think if you're trying to pluck an eye

out as opposed to just attack it is

there anything else I need to do besides

just like while you hit it's it's DM DM

Fiat surely I can I can deal damage to

her like normal damage and maybe if I

deal enough damage that's yeah Romi

damage alright I'll do that

I do seven no sorry eight eight points

of damage pieces it's weird it's like

you know exactly how oh no stay with us

on no election oh no all right there you

go we got it

okay so once I get the eye I'll use the

rest of my movement to go over and drop

it in the spaghetti oh God

does that stop Paul today no actually

you know actually I'll drop it in his

moonshine cup so he stops drinking it

cuz it's gross oh he drops it and just

kind of like boom Hey look how I'm like

child's play it's like somehow it's

better alright uh better get outta here

before I get leg drop mr. Hogan is

comforting her and looks at you with

fire in his eyes and starts stomping

toward you

uh no I'm just like what do you want

from me it was that they didn't like see

your pickup that like I know this this

Raven right dude did they well it's now

sitting across from you and staring at

you and you were flipping it off so it's

pretty clear that you have something I

actually started perched on paltin

shoulder so I could drop it in his drink

so I'm just happy with my shoulder I'm

gonna um I'm gonna purse I'm gonna try

to persuade the guy and be like it's not

my bird you got a property you got a

problem around here you should probably

stop feeding animals all right we're all

persuasion at disadvantage hmm oh that

that's an a d1 let's go back to Strix

rampage

three arrows come from a whole different

vantage points to try to hit you Strix

Wow they they they rolled 18 18 and 20

naturally so I'm like my destiny you

might be dead yeah so I was sorry and I

you froze there b4 + so an arrow if it's

from a short bow does a d6 if it's from

a longbow it's a d8 okay all right so it

was too short bows in a longbow so you

take

you take 11 piercing damage oh yeah I'm

dead bug just like my destiny will go

into the afterlife

all right straight I just fall off the

tightest super-strict flies in a

moldering heap as the guards descend

upon her and the dinosaur just kind of

like looks scared and jittery and let's

see ya actually still doesn't run away

from the fire it's a brave little Alice

or whose name we have yet to learn Burt

you see the marketplace ablaze strix

porcupine with arrows fall off onto the

ground you still see no sign of Colton

and you're standing amongst the bodies

what do you do

begrudgingly feel like roll his eyes a

little bit and just kind of be like

mother qo cutting action - and then can

I do I see the cars

kind of closing in on strix yeah all

right so I dashed right up to them and

I'm holding my wound and I'm running up

I'd as soon as I get up there I'm like

I'll say there's more down the alleyway

they're brutal and they're continuing

through you have to stop them pretty

good for tagging Oh ed what an advantage

an advantage okay I just say I hate the

awful crew because they're actually more

like functional than the rhythmic normal

21 the guards are like over there thank

you good citizen Oh goddamn it

hmm

so as soon as they run i like grabs

tricks by the wrist and to start like

begrudgingly dragging her body and just

like to get away from the scene of the

crime

hopefully paulten sees or I'll try to

find them or whatever I was let's get

out of there all right

so yeah like it's dragging her just

dragging her face down there like hair

is just dragging on the ground a blood

is like following you you probably see

Moulton over there being airplane spin

to play a very big man that sounds like

it's his problem yeah you know what

actually that's exactly what you see as

you drag Strix back down the road some

of the citizens see you but at this

point they're more concerned at the fact

that their entire marketplace is on fire

like a fireman and you know with passing

pails of water that kind of thing

you drag Strix back down the road and

you see palton exactly as Chris said in

an airplane spin looks like he might

barf actually after like Eddie Paulson

rola Constitution saving through look

out he's looking for the top ropes

that's an 8 and unpacks rolodex Terra T

check oh ok

I rolled okay I rolled a 5 it sprays all

over you oh yeah there's a raven covered

in barf all right d if you happen upon

this scene while you're dragging dead

strix by the wrists what do you do can I

do something while being spun are we in

initiative ok all right I'll put Strix

his body behind something hopefully not

gonna stabilize her just gonna drop her

off okay you know if she dies his own

damn

but you know she is useful and then is

he say you say still spinning paltin

yeah good I'm gonna waltz Ryan up with

the sword and stick him okay stab mr.

sharp keep Hogan yeah hopefully I'll do

an attack role Oh nein nein yeah it

doesn't hit I don't know what happens

how come you don't hit him

probably just gets like one of paltin

swinging boots to the head yeah all

right I guess we should roll initial

okay ah initiative oh yeah pölten Scott

palton was gonna do something though

yeah if I may like while he's cuz I

wanted to do is while he's spinning me

like so I'm just like perched on his

shoulders right like and he's like okay

so likewise made me what I wanted to do

was just just like reach out and put my

hand on his face and then thunder wave

them just from point-blank so they think

he makes a constitution even throw yeah

I'm casting at second level so it's

gonna be three d8 sure huge music no one

has helped strike so it's just going to

like get rid of one of her death saves

no eye drops tricks off away

that's ten and he has to what does he

has to its a constitution saving throw

against whatever problems save DC is

which which is a 15 okay he does not

save versus that so he's gonna take all

ten and he's gonna get blasted ten feet

away from his current position let's see

where was he facing I think he was

facing away from the bar so he goes

slamming back into the window the window

shatters and he lands stunned after

taking his under way to the face I just

passed

back up I'm just like freshing myself

off just like wipe a little of vomit off

my favorite unpack rolled a whopping

five on his initiative okay I was I

actually think that with that okay we

don't even need barkeep ogen it like

houses he ends up like I doesn't want

anymore what do you guys do if yeah if

he's not messing with us but if he is if

he really is Schmucks Rogan he will go

down but then he'll get a sudden burst

of second energy shaking his fists with

his eyes bulged out and then he's got we

all turned around and walk away that's

done and then yeah he gets back up yeah

I'll stick to the five four hump ox

wonder how many wanted posters are gonna

be at Fort nines are yeah I'll just use

the same initiative related before which

was 13 yeah yeah so we know on

timing-wise when she's been here death

saves yeah I got a 17 okay uh 21 had a

smoke smog and fair against that all

right keep your eye out for a little

Hulkamaniacs I did not know I would hit

on such a crisp and or sorry Shmuel

Khomeini I don't want to get sued

exactly okay and let's see let's find

out if Marsha sees what I mean Marsha

one-eyed Marsha is not feeling too hot

so I don't know how she's gonna her

but alright um Strix no paltin you go

first actually yeah you were brushing

yourself off and kind of staring him

down mm-hmm what do you do

I'm going to so how far oh well he's

like 10 feet from me yeah I'm going I'm

going to like as I'm like cleaning

myself off and like finally like just

recompose myself I just give them like a

glare and I'm gonna cast dissonant

whispers on him which is a wisdom saving

throw failed save is 3d6

all right all right so let's see so I'm

just filling his head with all these

things just like your business is a

failure no one likes any of your food

that's why no one's out here you staff

it's all garbage you know like three

wrestling moves that's a seven points of

damage all right he he looks ill he

looks sick to his stomach with with pure

hurt feelings good all right Strix it's

your turn make a death saving throw I

would like to bleed or drool on someone

please okay unfortunately you can't move

and you are alone behind something no it

said so you can drool on the ground I do

maybe on the rim the hand you can drill

on the hand I'm holding I'm hugging man

oh I got a 12 all right you pass great

yeah yes it's your turn so is this dude

still still standing pretty strong right

now or is he he does not look strong he

looks he looks like he's down and out

but he was making moves like he was

going to stand up and and come at you

again all right someone in chat said the

restaurants name is pasta mania

[Laughter]

death will step forward onto a table and

leap from it to get enough height to

come straight down with a bag over this

dude's head oh all right I'm basically

making a tack roll with the bag all

right let's see I feel like that should

be a Dex check more than an attack

shouldn't it put the thing over his head

I would say it's still more an attack

I'm not gonna have proficiency or

anything in it cuz that's not a weapon

yeah that's me but I'm still gonna

attempt it with my ebuy yes oh uh 14 you

almost get him but it like glances off

of he has like a kerchief tied around

his head and he just slips off as you

pull the bag and unfortunately you don't

get it over his head it gets caught on a

beefy arm yeah okay

dang it yeah good try though

Marsha Marsha comes screaming out the

door with one eye bloodied and

brandishing a club and goes for goes for

paulsen and she what's your AC 15:13 way

no 15 she bunks you with the club and

again I don't know I should know how

much weapons Club does 1 D 4 plus if she

has a strength bonus just 2 damage to

you halten just clunky on the head with

this club just sick poem just like ah

she's holding one I just enough to draw

a line yeah just enough to concur on

that all right

that makes it unboxes turn alright um

pox probably saw where death dragged

Strix so he's gonna in barf cover Draven

form fly away from this chaos and go

districts land on her and attempt to

stabilize her with a unskilled medicine

check Wow someone cares and oh that's a

natural one so I just start pecking her

body she was a little bit power-hungry

it is her fault

I mean she did write an Allosaurus into

the marketplace

exactly all right all right

smokes Mogan it's it's your turn and

Chris you you have been playing smoke

smoking so well

what does smoke smoking do so obviously

he's got to stand up he's got to bounce

off something and then hurled himself

bodily lifting one leg up to try to

catch somebody in the chin with it so I

imagine just like maybe two three

bounces and yeah he sort of throws

himself up against one railing throws

himself up against another needlessly

and then but like before that he's like

running around the restaurant like

trying to get like everyone all right

and then he comes up and he just lays a

big boot into somebody's head and into

Paulson's head okay for the boot for me

Chris

me yeah okay sure I don't know what I'm

adding so I'll just tell you what the

die roll is okay I rolled a 12 on the

die I think I don't know does he have a

kick per finish he's probably he's

probably proficient with the high kick

yeah that's a thing that you're home

yeah yeah sure okay Paulson I know you

just told me you're a C but I forget I

think there's a 15 yeah so you just

guessed

smoke smoke lying off past you it's just

like a

huh oh my god how did we end up here so

let's see do I get is there like any

time any kind of like attack of

opportunity or some as he's like missing

me can I like this kind of no no okay

cool no I'm gonna see he's looking

pretty messed up right mm-hmm um do I

still have the moonshine or is that like

long gone uh I mean it's up to you did

you put it down no let's see you it was

on the table so it's sitting there not

on the table next to you okay so so

where is he now he just might have

landed like a few feet from you okay

okay I take the moonshine and take the

jar and just bash it over his head just

add your strength bonus to yeah okay yep

oh no never mind you end up actually

throwing the moonshine like just out of

the courtyard do you try to make it look

like you meant to do that say yeah

that'll be you oh my god

it shatters and Marcia's eye goes

rolling into the street Oh No

the rain would just leave strikes to us

all right it's a strict turn now so

great mm-hmm an eleven all right another

pass close to life all right

I really don't want to be alright this

dude is still standing yeah and marsh is

there too oh my god

all right um yeah with him Sola engaged

in paltin is hoping to get him alive but

that's fine I'll take them down let's

come back forward with the short-sword

right in the back doesn't see it coming

just stab him right in the back okay so

let's do a short short attack 15 yep it

hits right shoulder blades good and

there's a twist him there too to sell

and that's so evil yeah

and with sneak attack damage that is 13

total he goes down and what does he say

as he falls Chris he's reaching out for

someone to tag him reaches up for Marsha

yeah I don't know he doesn't usually

he's in the ring hook it's not shouting

much he says he groans sadly as he

reaches out to be tagged in you can't

say can't say anything because too much

blood is filling his oh god and as and

as he's going down I'm going to use my

fast hands ability to pull a sword out

and swim up in that back and what it

back and super bump in the back

I'll use like the use of fast hands use

object to bag him up oh that's Oh bag

yeah okay Oh hopefully is evil well for

a while Hulk Hogan was like lawful good

but then he went over to another oh yeah

this could be Hollywood home yeah yeah

he went he went kind of to the dark side

when he joined another organization so

he started wearing black and yeah I'm

going to know anything about this now

Chris no no I don't think so he's off

television so what yeah yeah he did that

reality show for a while yeah and there

was the business with Gawker and yeah

right yeah and American Gladiators oh

that's right I forgot about that

yeah so it turns over this this

peacefully retired really take a

controversy it's like how does the IRL

lore of Hulk Hogan affect this character

exactly it so you you have this hulking

bloody giant I'm so obsessive and I even

I've like I'm like I keep tugging on the

bag to see if like suddenly works or not

I was like strikes and throw her in

there I was trying to get a bunch of

work done in one day so we definitely

can't offer something yeah bones just

like that one spit in my drink it's

pretty messed up Marsha Marsha goes runs

away crying into the bar crying all

right Strix I think we're out of

initiative now unless anyone has um

parks would like to try again to

stabilize her okay yeah he just goes

over and like starts picking at her yeah

pulling out of here ear ear and

yeah oh god gross that is initiative

okay that we're done yeah Strix make one

more destination oh right yeah I got an

eight Oh No okay I guess we have to keep

going then all right

okay go ahead oh ha ha

Marshall just ran away so that would

make it unboxes turn who just did the

track stabilized and that brings us back

to Halton

how far did did Marsha get ah go get her

there's like there's like seven people

inside the bar and she's like hiding

behind the bar crying there's three

people behind the bar comforting her and

for standing on the other side of the

bar so they're just all in there I'm

trying to figure out if I really think

Marsha is evil or if it suggests

reaction to me not being the most

pleasant customer of the day oh no man I

couldn't even bag up this dude you think

she's gonna work

oh she's spitting my drink and then her

I was in my drink no one cares diesel to

say look we just go pick up that idiot

let's get out of here and you'll point

out red Strix

say uh Strix his feelings are hurt

secretly somewhere wait so straight

where where Strix she's over behind a

barrel like just outside the little

courtyard where yours you see a foot

sticking out and then you sort of turn

your angle and you can see ya corpse

lying there with a raven on it

thick another here I'm like fine but

before I actually leave just like just

as a little punctuation to my stay I'm

gonna cast some some vicious mockery I'm

Marsha just it just so you know okay

further twist the knife so it's yeah if

the target can hear you oh I say it out

loud okay cool

succeed a wisdom saving throw or take

1.d4 psychic damage
