[Music]

hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action oh I totally should have brought

them yeah but I brought my friendship

and magic my little pony dice so because

they were so good to me last time yeah

so previously in dice camera action the

characters set out into the jungles of

Kult guided by their saw real companion

dragon bait who has all these different

smells and along the way you picked up a

half work priest of warm named Umbra and

her goblins steward companion chumba

whom she rescued from executioner's run

and later he ran into Chum Bo's brother

Wamba who was kind of a dick which which

was confirmed when you had a spat with a

undead Tyrannosaur and then went into a

temple chasing after two ghosts of

little Shelton children and

Oh what happened next something to do

with evil in China remember oh yeah

evil and um you discovered at the top of

a color a symbol of the Sun and threw

that symbol was able to commune with a

saint who has a relationship with your

God levander the saint Saint Andre

offered you a very very difficult

decision

you could be restored to flesh or you

could have light fall your shattered axe

reassembled before your eyes or you

could remain a construct but be a

tougher construct and you chose option 3

and returned to your friends and a

spectacular beam of light after the

temple collapse nearly collapsed down

upon their heads and the only way one ba

got it with his life was to break his

fall off the pillar using his brother

and so chumba did not survive and I'm

really um that's true

I'm real uh was not pleased to hear that

her Stuart had been left behind and

crushed by his brother and so she scared

Wamba off and won but disappeared into

the foliage it was shortly thereafter

when evil in having disappeared in the

blaze of sunlight reappeared before her

friends that's Robin pickup yeah and I

mentioned last time that she reappeared

with the symbol of Lysander that used to

be on light fall and now emblazoned on

her chest like yeah on her I guess on

her breastplate but I think it's also

like she's wearing clothes and armors so

it's kind of hard to see some of this

stuff but it's there like actually

engraved on her chest as well and all of

the places where she used to be you know

just like plain wood because she's made

of wood and metal you know she's a

construct I imagine that now she's just

a more resplendent version of that like

maybe even some of the wood has inlaid

like vines and flowers and leaves for

her oath of the Ancients and she's got

everywhere that she had gold it's like

filigree with celestial writing on it

that says all of the the parts of her I

think she even has like

like her boots may be great yeah she

might have liked vine like tattoos like

they'd be tattoos on a normal person but

now they're just like vines inscribed

upon her flesh or her her artificial

limbs right I think all of the wood has

like nature stuff on it and then all of

all of the metal has like stun and

celestial solid gold yeah and I think

she has like maybe it's a circle it

maybe it's like a half thing she has

like some kind of cool headpiece - that

has like Sun and vines and things since

her hair is kind of like super badass

now or it's like steep side parted over

to one side but like this metal thing

coming over like this and she just

appears and like all of this is glowing

and she kind of looks at her friends and

and says something to the effect of like

I have been to see st. ontrol and I know

who I am

I remember who I am and I know now what

I'm supposed to do because I am even a

Valona Helbig Marcin ancient found

keeper of the light divine appointed

bond slave of the morning sunlight forge

warrior daughter of the Most High

luminous very defender of the dawn

reborn cower before me all who stand in

darkness or I will carve away for you

into the dawn mission specialist foggy

dresser she just sort of drops her staff

I told you it was for you listen to me

you were right you were so right Strix I

know that I'm just where I was meant to

be and in just the form I was meant to

be and she kind of like tink tanks on

her life kind of waves light fall around

and she then she's just kind of like

doing like warrior poses and like

flitting around she's just having a

grand old time like well

Wow she's not a she can't be Undead

death will approach him sky put a hand

on the shoulder and will say evil and

I'm glad you're safe it's good to see

you back to your old self

thank you give him a big construct hug

which is kind of she's got more sharpie

bits now than she had before now it's

time to get you back to who you know you

are after after that Holly death is like

holy night seriously I know everything's

gonna be all right dia I feel it in my

bones the positivity is just making

strix depressed so she's just smell like

a pall Tim doesn't like the wine motion

[Laughter]

handover the wine I think I hand it over

I'm just saying you pass like the straw

that you've got wired into finding this

backpack tag on his bag yeah just hand

her the end of the straw I try to like

do some fun like sparring movements with

DF coz I'm like I'm all about I'm just

like super happy I want him to be happy

too so I'm like that and I do like some

some sparring Steve he'll join me just

to be happy cuz he seems still sad and I

want him to be as happy as I am like

half-hearted bleep I was like I feel

like a giddy but yeah

like yeah she like let's surround him

while she's doing that while he's doing

that yeah it was kind of like kind of

happy creating your playfully uh like

back in their combat with her fighting

guys like that but he kind of tell that

he is trying to in share it awkward

awkward interaction I'm just trying to

spar she's like she goes and gives hugs

to everyone else too it was just like I

don't love my friends so much you guys

are always there for me and then you can

do exactly what I was supposed to do I'm

still glad I have friends like you

that was a Ryan oh then you get the

dragon mate then what do you do um

unbridled she cannot really stop she

hugs dragon baby or like feet off the

floor hugs by the way she was just like

flying around so she keeps just like

running into people on how to reminisce

flying away yep and right now if I

remember correctly dragon bait smells

like brimstone yeah but you don't smell

anything because you have no sense of

smell so you give him a hug and then he

just sort of after you release him

eventually

he just sort of draws your attention

with a nod toward um bro who you can

tell is just very depressed right now

she just lost her steward and she's kind

of standing away from the rest of the

party kind of lost in thought I go and I

take her hand and I say do I I don't

know that jumba's been lost huh well you

know well that's true there's this

moment of you're not sure why she's this

dark little storm cloud on your sunny

day and then you sort of do a mental

count and you see that well every time

you've seen her she's always had a

goblin and her goblins not here so you

don't know what happened to him but

there's you into it immediately that

something has happened so I've been like

oh and then I kind of see that and I

kind of like Flint slowly to the ground

and then walk over to her and and take

her hand and say I noticed we're 1 less

than this party now are you all right we

should we should get back in the canoes

and get to camp vengeance as quickly as

possible people and just kind of nods

and squeezes her hand and says his light

will never go out but then doesn't press

the issue because obviously she doesn't

want to talk about it kind of like makes

motion to everyone to like let's go

let's go let's get in the community okay

we are sans what we can do and we fixed

it didn't we oh yeah yeah we did

oh everybody's a bending spell that's

right yeah yeah okay fine all right so

you make your pathway past the rotting

dead big poking dinosaur thing back to

your canoes by the river you start to

hop in and um bro this casts one final

glance back to camp righteous before you

do you want any other teeth or claws or

anything no and then you head upriver

and any injuries or spells that you've

used or recuperated over the next few

days as you continue up the rivers

oceans star eventually in the after

spending many nights in the waffle hut

and passing time with Simon and waffles

a very sort of morose umbral and a

typically quiet and dragon bait on a

certain morning you are coming up the

river and you round a bend in the river

and see through the foliage a crude

timber fortification a walled compound

with watchtowers and you can see over

the walls of the peaks of tents and all

around this compound which is right near

the river it's only about maybe 30 feet

from the river shore all around it is a

ditch

and bristling out of the ditch or all of

these sharpened logs and stakes probably

given the size of them they're designed

to basically impale like dinosaurs who

try to stampede against the walls and

you know big stuff like that

you can see on the river's edge just

outside the large gatehouse to this fort

are several robots you count four of

them and you can also see all around the

fort are piles of charred human corpses

and flayed animal carcasses all swarming

with flies and then the last thing that

yeah and then the last thing you see on

the north side of the camp hanging off

the walls sort of splayed out or what

look like giant skinned frog carcasses

yeah

I'm just hanging there and collecting

more flies Jared your mutant

he's so horrified he can't see I'll turn

Braille and I have her like I see on the

bother you something it's just

addressing her but it's not like during

my days are like the whole round just

what the hell happened here he says I

don't know it's possible that they've

come under attack by undead Undead

that sounds like a job for a servant of

levander just rusev I tried like

covering her mouth like stop yelling

okay look examine some of the animal

corpses or even the Frog whole kind of

flayed up because this seems very

intentional rather than average there by

the way is a map showing the fort

you can see the river yeah so you

basically can pull one of you can pull

your canoe up to the shore

d/f hop out and go off and check out the

corpses you can see that the the burnt

human remains appear to be a combination

of what were probably live humans who

died and Undead humans who were put down

but they've all been sort of tossed non

just indiscriminately onto these piles

and set ablaze you think the reason they

were probably set on fire was just to

mitigate the possibility of disease

[Music]

yeah the evidence the local evidence

suggests that there must have been a

huge wave of undead that fought here

that ran across through the jungle

attacked the camp tried to climb the

walls and were basically fought back and

and there's the there's every every bit

of evidence you can see suggest that

this must have happened more than once

because some of the burnt piles are sort

of old and dead piles there's no smoke

coming off of them and others are fairly

fresh so this place must be in an area

of the jungle that's just absolutely

riddled with Undead

there's more what you would say ghoul

and zombie corpses lying around then

fresh you know anything fresh now as for

the you can't it's hard to climb down

into the muddy ditch and up the other

side to get a really good look at the

frog corpses but from your perspective

now closer up you can see that they're

not just giant frogs they look like they

were frog humanoids frog folk of some

kind like bigger than say Polliwogs

so bully bugs are frog folk and they

stand about five six feet tall these

frogs that are smaller they're more like

halflings

all right if one of us go up and take a

peek yeah you can hop on your broom when

you do that though you are spotted by

guards in on the watchtowers these

appear to be human guards by the way and

the way they're there because it's so

hot and stifling here in the jungle

they're not wearing armor they're just

wearing basically cloth uniforms and

emblazoned on the front of their two

bards is a symbol of a white gauntlet

clutching a sword horizontally which you

know to be the symbol of the order of

the gauntlet to which your friend Umbro

belongs all right well you certainly

freaked them out they say have there

some crossbows up and they were good

night like level them at you but they

just have them pointed up at the sky

right now and one of them asks you to

declare your intentions they don't seem

to know what you're talking about look

for the story okay

the scary tiefling witch on the broom he

flies away okay as you look into the

foliage you don't see any well maker

perceptions are actually alright so I

was more worried about the undead they

can deal with this he wants us of the

guards Wow

and all the day yeah this is gonna be

good yeah from your area over here from

your area advantage point you don't see

any walking undead around if they seemed

we'll all been killed but from up here

you can see or get a better sense of how

the battle played out just because of

all the tracks and things

it looks like undead must have come out

and at least three different waves and

attacked the fort from the north the

west and the south but it looks like

they were repelled each time and then

there's tracks that are fresher that

indicate that after the undead were all

felled by arrows and crossbow bolts and

whatnot that forces from the fort came

out went around to make sure that they

were all dead and so there's all these

sort of circles around you know where

they just sort of did a casual

inspection and then you see drag marks

where bodies were pulled and then heaped

into piles before they were doused with

oil and set of blaze yep yeah and you

also see with your 20 that there are

there are trails leading out into the

jungle which suggests that they have an

active series of patrols out of the fort

to go hunting for undead or at least

spying to see where they're coming from

you also see there's a fair amount of

activity inside the camp from your

vantage point there are three large

tents two of them look like they might

be Hospital tents and the other one some

sort of command tent right in the center

and then there are smaller tents which

you assume are just like barracks for

guards there aren't any permanent

structures other than the watchtowers in

the gatehouse

are those guards still like like unsure

of what we're up to

they sort of track strict so she flies

back down to the rest of the gang and so

they're just kind of looking out toward

you on the river's edge to see what you

might do next see what's other strange

creatures you might send their way on

flying brooms okay are they in like

talking to stints err yeah you could

shout out at them at this point because

the the nearest ones on the gatehouse

would be about 40 feet away alright cool

I like drunkenly fumble over I'm like

doing guys I can make us and friends

check this out so he goes up in the mud

and you know he's like up to his shins

and mud as he wades toward the gatehouse

okay I persuade them that we're we are

not people to bring them harm I'm gonna

do that by saying hey we cool make us a

suasion chick okay

also just a heads up all my Dicer packed

so the only thing I found in my desk was

this oh wow cool gave me a not one we're

not cool you have one of them show that

down at you nervously state your

intentions

nothing bad

what's with the broom broom Mike oh it's

cool

I'm so screaming she does that we all

we've all got some issues

um bro we'll wait up behind you and say

I am on both silver tusks priest of torn

I've been assigned to this camp I'm here

to meet with commander breakbone these

are my traveling companions let us in

after he says let us and I'm like please

all right as they gaze down upon you and

your and the half work woman beside you

they will immediately one of them will

immediately drop out of view as he goes

down a ladder into the encampment and to

notify the commander that the priest of

Torme has arrived not too long

thereafter The Gatehouse

outer doors open inward you see a couple

guards pulling them open through the mud

so now you have basically an opening

into camp vengeance and are you gonna

just leave your boats tied up with the

others out here yeah I mean I've got

theirs there yeah seems safe to ours

yeah okay as you wait up through the

muck and it is really muddy here oh yeah

you're floating above I assume the same

is true for Strix at least for now yeah

when they I see that they're letting

just feeling I didn't believe death goes

and locks himself

I avoid muck with my flying man

[Laughter]

there's like a point when you're walking

under them like for what it's worth

flying is really fun

Cindy F as you sort of wade through the

muck under the gatehouse you can see up

through the slats above you there the

roof of the gatehouse where the guards

were standing even zi1 them staring at

you through the the cracks and the logs

but you also see they've raped some sort

of like murder whole system here so they

can pour oil down if anything broke

through the gate and none of this yeah

and your foot kind of gets stuck in the

mud at one point and you have to fly pop

it out and when you head into the

quote-unquote courtyard which is just a

muddy you know yard basically there are

some barrels that look like they might

contain water and you see it a guard who

looks really kind of weak and scrawny

he's got a bowl that he just sort of

dips into one and he sort of drinks out

of the bowl behind him is a hospital

tent and all around the hospital tent

you can see wounded guards standing or

sitting in the mud waiting to be led

inside one of the guard one of the

guards in the door of the gatehouse who

opened the doors to let you in says to

UM Braille silver tusks that commander

breakbone wants to meet her right away

and then after that she's to go to the

hospital tents and tend to the sick I've

been to the sick bay look realistic I

can help the guard ignores you and says

your companions can wait outside

the command tent okay well if you change

your mind I'd love to heal some people

for you just in the light of levander

you know the morning like buses are okay

can I try to discreetly turn into a

cloud sure

you're a cloud you can see among the

things in here apart from the the

sleeping tents and whatnot there are

some crates of supplies that look like I

haven't been unpacked yet there's also

some standing pools of water that look

filthy and muddy and actually a lot of

flies are gathering over them you also

see a pen in one corner that contains

four very sickly goats one of the goats

is being milked or is trying to be

milked but it's kind of being stubborn

and trying to get away from the guard

who's attempting to milk it it's kind of

comical and sad at the same time and so

umbral disappears into the command tent

and guys are just you guys are waiting

outside with a guard who is like

slapping flies off his neck and

generally looks like he's just about the

unhappiest person you've ever met he

does nothing he would just assume being

held and here it looks like and he just

doesn't say a word to you and there's

something about him to suggest that he

has seen things you know that look in

the eyes that he will never be able to

shake for the rest of his life and then

there's this awkward period where you're

just standing next to him and dragon

bait does not seem at all bothered by

flies and they seem to ignore him

completely and yeah you can sneak into

the tent as a cloud you know I want to

try and hear what they're saying okay

just I'm concerned from all these dead

bodies

dragons mate smells like ham by the way

oh he's just waiting around nervously

okay so yeah Strix you can make a

stealth check see I'm really bad go

hidden I'm

[Laughter]

when you enter even see that umbral is

meeting with a man who you guys all

watch Game of Thrones right course okay

he kind of looks like a shorter thinner

Stannis Stannis Baratheon there's an

aura about him of nobility in command

that his stature doesn't quite measure

up to he's also got thinning hair but

his hair is red almost golden brushed

back off his face he's wearing basically

just ordinary clothes and there's mud

spatters on them

it looks like fine dress to wear in

water deep among the nobility but

completely out of place here he probably

chose to wear it because it's sort of

light and billowy but it's got all these

sort of frills and things that make no

sense and then strapped on top of that

he's got a breastplate which is also

kind of heavy and weird and for the

jungle but it's got a symbol on the

front of it of the order of the

gauntlets so I guess he's supposed to

wear it to impress

anyway Strix it looks like umbral is

meeting this man for the first time like

she didn't know him previously and she

stands about a foot and a half taller

than him and he is barking orders at her

saying asking her why it took her so

long to get here and she says well we

were really weak we stopped the camp

right just to check it out and she

basically explains your whole journey

and why it took so long and he brushes

her off and just says there are at least

20 people in the tents that she needs to

tend to he needs his patrols up to full

strength and she shouldn't waste any

time talking to him and then proceeds to

send him/her away that you can see there

are two other figures in the room and

they're sort of standing off to one side

and they appear to be lieutenants under

breakbone but they're dressed a little

bit more importantly than the guards you

saw outside one of which is a dwarf with

a with golden hair nicely hearted and

trimmed and a nicely trimmed golden

beard and the other is a female human

who is wearing looks like she must have

just gotten back from some sort of

Patrol because she's absolutely

splattered with mud and stuff and she's

even got some blood on her and she's got

a wound a tied off around her shoulder

it looks like a bandage that's still got

blood it's almost dripping it's so

saturated and umbrella says maybe I

should tend to her first and break bone

looks at his lieutenant and then looks

back to her and he says I gave you an

order

go to the tent tend to the sick

she'll be fine go and Umbro just those

nods and leaves and I mean yeah and then

commander breakbone says and take your

with you all right

the dwarf comes out shortly after you

guys emerge and addresses the rest of

you and says I'm captain orde fire beard

welcome to camp vengeance

commander breakbone wants to have a word

with you

it's fire beard like a family name or

does your beard actually do something

with fire

it's a clan name my beard is an actual

fire but in the light it can look that

way oh it does even like he said you had

a long trip do you want some water I

would but I don't think I need any

thanks though

yeah yeah and we're all out of wine all

right guys we gotta go this place has

nothing nothing special dog I don't eat

or drink right oh you do not

yeah yeah even just kind of longing what

he says do you want watery looks kind of

like hmm Strix and are you gonna stay

out here Yuna going with your friends

the dwarf dwarf kind of stops you before

you pass through the threshold of the

tent and he says commander breakbone

doesn't want you in the tent oh great

but you can wait out here with me now my

feelings are hurt why can't she go in

the tent that's not very nice I'll wait

out here with you Strix we can talk

about going to the tent

no please all right I just attend to

these goats it's fine I I'm just I'm

just here to set things on fire I see

that she's not letting ya and I'm gonna

talk to him I'm just like so who said

that she can't come in the dwarf looks

at you this or casts a raised eyebrow

glance at you and says commander

breakbone says and he's in charge

uh-huh so what is he like like your

command

oh wait they're pretty sad don't worry

about me and fire well just scream real

loud if you get scared okay same for you

I mean I'm scared but you know stab dirt

hunger I see the I see the door flakes

tonight eyeing me and then I like

readjust so I can like side-eye him back

I mean that we respect your customs and

order of command of course thank you for

having us our pleasure and I just kind

of shows spalted forward into the Ted

okay just watch out for his beard it

does something with fire I was half

listening when you enter the tent you

see that it's just you guys commander

breakbone and the wounded captain with

him she doesn't say anything as you

entered but a commander breakbone says

I'm drafting you into the order of the

gauntlet yes due to ailments that have

deceived my men I need your help to run

the trolls around the camp whoa I'm

sorry that wasn't part of the deal we

already had our own things doing it

we're not here to be ordered we're not

soldiers I mean we do love helping but I

am already part of a higher order in the

morning Lord's light and his charge on

me to keep order and peace and life and

beauty in the world have you heard about

our morning Lord for Sanders he walks he

walks over to you and kind of looks you

up and down and he says I am in charge

of bringing order to this camp

I am the order here do you understand

Oh certainly this camp is a nice place

for you to hold order but of course the

morning Lord is in charge of order for

the entire universe so of course you

would be the higher power and we're

certainly happy to help but I just I

don't know I'd have to seek His guidance

on whether I should join another order

or something like that he says if we

don't mount these patrols and deal with

the enemies we see to overcome us all of

the men within these walls will die oh

we can't allow that yes I think we need

to help this whole time by the way I'm

like closely examining him like I'm I'm

just like

so which bone what wait which one's

broken none none of broken that's my

name all right commander misleading he

says our camp is the final bastion of

civilization in this untamed land we've

got armies of undead

we've got hostile frog people attacking

us at every turn we've got to destroy

them what what can you tell us about

these frog people because sometimes

maybe people are dealing with some stuff

at home and maybe it would help to like

talk to them and work things out they're

a hostile force that attacks us with

poisoned arrows the poison is deadly if

not debilitating he says they have a

village nearby and we just have to find

it when we do we'll destroy them we'll

wipe them out

utterly what if we just persuade them

not to shoot us with poison arrows

anymore and just to be you can't

negotiate with these non-human pond

dwelling creatures there no that

attitude you can't they're vicious

monsters you can see he's practically

just like he's trying to contain himself

but he's trembling when he's talking

what he's saying this he says if we

don't exterminate them looks terminate

us the way I see here mr. fixed bone is

um it's so break bone I mean that's what

you're asking us but like what if what

if they had asked us to like do the same

to you then how would you feel about

that it wouldn't be too stoked would you

their feelings don't concern me it's

their intentions that I'm worried about

do any of us know anything about this

race of frog people like have we seen

them before read about them or anything

mm-hmm you you don't remember

specifically you remember the guards on

the wall supporting ions are Oh shouting

out at you to beware certain creatures

you don't remember them saying well

maybe you do remember them saying

something about frog folk you're not

sure it may have been one of the races

that they warned you about it okay he

says you'll run up patrol you'll go

north west of here you'll search for

signs of this frog folk and their

village if you find a report back

immediately don't attack them don't

confront them and don't negotiate with

them do you understand he didn't say

don't tell them about the light of

levander as much as we'd love to help

you that would I can't unless perhaps

you if you were to say if we did this

for you perhaps you could provide some

information to me for example the

potential location of or illunga

velocity

just outside quickly goats goats goats

why do you want to go there we have our

tasks and you have yours

well this how will this help the order

in any way and its battle against evil

oh yeah undoubtedly you see him walk

away from you and go over to his captain

and they have a very quiet conversation

that only lasts maybe 10 seconds and

then you can see that she seems like a

calming influence on him and when he

turns around he says you run the patrols

you report back what you've learned then

we will furnish you with a map

all right

kind of turned towards evil and

important looking for like acceptance of

terms I think that sounds just fine okay

all right

I've always loved maps Hey

yeah as long as it's a map out of here

this place blows all right he doesn't

mean that it's a bit you have a very

lovely home

I mean this place is just hot garbage

it's it's quite warm and welcoming we

could do this but only understand that

we're not warriors we're not here to

fight became to obtain information for

you but that's all we can do once that

is done we have to leave I'm a warrior

in the service of love manners your

orders are to patrol and reconnoiter I

don't expect you to fight anything but

if you encounter undead or you encounter

more of these frog folk you're going to

have to kill them or they will kill you

we have a little experience with killing

undead am i right Deanna that I nudge

him like I stabbed a shadow and get this

drunk to a sleeping tender at least my

name's honest my name's Jess

while that's going on streck's you've

sort of come into the pen where these

four sickly goats are going around and

they really don't want to be milked me

you can understand why they're not they

don't want to put out there's very weak

and it just looks like they're emaciated

and they haven't eaten properly I'll try

and find them some food while this whole

conversation is going on there okay

there's like nothing really around

though there's there's there's a couple

crates that haven't been unpacked

outside the command tent yet but they're

sealed up and you don't suss you suspect

they contain the rations and things but

nothing that the guards are willing to

feed to the goats right oh poor ghosts

do I have any

food I can get mom you have do it you

have some scraps that they will

absolutely devour yeah but they're so

hungry oh poor guys yeah I also

apologize for killing so many of them in

the past and as you feed the goats your

friends come kind of piling back out of

the tent reading their body language you

can see paltin is a little more uppity

than usual and even seem to be pushing

him a little more than she would like to

such and such with my lying ass name

oh wait great we found a way out of here

I just look at dance like while there's

just talking them just like what

happened I found us a way to get some

information to get as closest to oral

lanka great it will require some tasks

of us it don't freak out well we're

asking the wrong person

all we have to do is kill some frogs and

stuff we're only looking for an

encampment of where there could be

located so they could properly defend

themselves or mount a counter-attack

that's all we're doing

we're probably gonna kill someone we

usually do try to avoid that we can look

it's just a recon mission it'll be fast

the three of you fly fly I mean none of

those are strong enough to carry you on

our own but what if like we all work

together and flee together maybe we

could like carry by the back of your

your your cloak and maybe you could fly

too you just feel so left out I don't

want you to feel left out

oh we could like you know use a rope or

some and just like you know time to he's

you know he's someone on the ground is

actually still useful because begin to

use that to give proper landmarks out

and get directed to remain yeah that's

right you are you are so useful too yeah

that's right

find out why they would let me back in

it's not like magic well I can only

surmise that they're dealing with a lot

up on dead and spooky things and oh oh I

see how it is

oh right Oh fine I'm just spooky yes I

mean straight I mean come on

just like strategy strikes is the dwarf

still there yes yes say yeah is this guy

mr. mmm

fire fire beard and even look kind of

wakes at him who's got a mess no making

an honest work Valley this guy let's

just get this done

the church is like yelling at the door

if we have to Patrol it's just getting

over we're pleased the dwarf um will say

if you follow me I'll take you to one of

the tents you can put your stuff there

okay that sounds smart I don't have any

stuff okay all right yeah he leads you

to a tent that's basically built on a

small little plot of dry land surrounded

by mud and even he says the soldiers are

in here previously were killed so you

can have theirs cool bless them in the

light of the holy Lord may you see a

couple of bed rolls in there and that's

really about it they've all been bundled

up how didn't matter - it's an empty

just pitched tent I'll be big enough for

about oh four people the only supplies I

want to bring in and leave there or the

same ones that we would have stashed in

the canoe more personal effects I'm

going to keep with me and bring me at me

and that includes a lot of light food

and trapping supplies

just as I don't trust them to not touch

our things when they're gone and give

them up to soldiers all right and

captain fire beard says that when it's

time for you to set out captain Saldana

will come by and give you some

information about where to go all right

sounds good you need anything just

holler

then he nods and walks away through the

mud but she seems nice

this place is a slaughterhouse week

we're gonna die because everyone is dead

not even certain that I can die anymore

you could actually hear in the tent next

to yours cuz you got two basically two

rows of tents that like somebody is in

there just balling their eyes out they

just want to defend this camp this camp

should have fallen a long time ago yeah

but they've been Stallard thus far

I feel like Stallard might not be the

only thing that they are they should

have think there's too many dead bodies

here umbrellas here for a reason and

she's only been helpful to us and then

she got yelled at

she's not in charge here I can't speak

for the rest of them their lives here

but at least we can get what we need

can't we aren't we supposed to help by

going and finding these frog people and

and doing some that's exactly what we're

doing some good democracy and so we can

tell them not to attack anymore and they

can all become friends that's not in

fact what he told you do but that's all

right happening yeah yeah it's um it's

since you guys are having a conversation

here you can see it's sort of died down

a little bit now it's more like a

sobbing and then you also see somebody

coming on the hospital tent that looks

like they must have received some

magical administration from Tom Brokaw's

a they do generally

in in decent shape making her it's a

young woman maybe in her mid-20s who is

wearing the livery of the order of the

gauntlet but she can see that it's got

stains all down the front of it from

blood and gore and other messiness but

she makes her way back to her tent and

when she sees you she says fresh meat

you're the ones who came with the

priests she says yeah but I'm not made

of me and these aren't for eating either

so not me no we're all meat here except

for me what's your name

cassia cassia caveat

that's beautiful name cassia white

cassia d'hubert come back to me I'm even

very nice to meet you you look like

you've been through a lot she says I've

been stationed here for 30 days I'm one

of the new ones I just had my first

confrontation with the undead under

attendant ago well I made two friends

here since I arrived they're both on

pyres outside the walls now so you can

imagine not too well

bless them as they travel to the light

I'm sorry for your loss I want to walk

up to her and kind of look at her it

really started me like what's the dark

of this place what's going on here I am

concerned that there is something else

happening why do you stay here if

everyone's dying why are they holding

this spot

she says the order of the gauntlet came

here because this land has become so

overrun with undead that it threatens to

push civilization

of the peninsula of child altogether we

are here to be a beacon of light yeah to

make the point that evil doesn't always

win and sometimes evil has to be thought

head-on you don't back down just because

it's stronger than you preach cassia do

you believe that I did no I'm not sure

you'll believe it again we'll fight hand

in hand shoulder to shoulder with you

we'll make sure that these undead are

pushed back won't we

Oh Edie mmm it's like I said this is a

slaughterhouse these people are just

being written into the dead book every

five minutes and it's not it's it's it's

a it's a point we need to find where the

end that are coming from if it was just

the undead maybe we'd stand a chance but

now it's these frog creatures and they

just there's so many I cradle her face

I'm like don't you worry about those

frogs don't you worry we're gonna take

good care of that Cassie and you're just

gonna get some good rest and then we're

gonna come back we'll help you done dad

you're just gonna be just fine and

you're gonna be bathed in the light all

right you see her - her eyes start to

well up with tears like issues no one

has spoken this way to her and so long

she'd almost forgotten what it's like to

feel warmth from another person I hold

her to my metal bosom and at the same

time there's she she wants to put her

arms around you but then when she does

she realizes what she's touching isn't

real and so it's just altogether very

awkward

gasps oh you've been here for 30 days

how many attacks have you seen here at

the camp - yeah which there was

directions that they come from the

undead came from the south from folk

from the Northwest they call them brung

gross yeah they don't speak our

languages well we're about to go look

for them do you want to come with us you

seem real nice I don't have orders to I

suspect I'll get new orders in the

morning once Captain Commander breakbone

realizes I'm well enough to fight evil

it's very disappointed that Cathy you

can't come with them you have to

understand we all follow orders here

it's the only way we can stay together

you know is that working out it could be

worse it could be better well we don't

want to go the way of camp righteous ya

know that camp didn't look so healthy

well then we'll go forth and make a way

for you cassia don't you worry let's

leave right now team let's go find those

groans they said they're gonna come get

us

look we have orders we'll follow them

and play nice for now good

all right fine then I'm gonna find out

who's crying and make sure they're okay

I'm not alright when you pony do you

think any comfort you could provide to

this camp would not go unappreciated

yeah even when you poke into the next

tent you can see that it's a kind of

youngish man probably in his late teens

early 20s you can see that he's got a

splint on his leg and he's got it

stretched out and he's reclining

awkwardly

and when you come in he's like brushing

a big centipede and like but mashing it

with his boot to kill it you can see

that he's just as his wit's end he's in

the worst place that he didn't possibly

imagine and he's just feeling like a

sail on every edge and when you poke

your head in and like the sunlight just

hits your gold and gleaming armor a

certain way you just kind of look like

this luminous being he looks up at you

almost afraid for an instant and then he

just sort of bursts into tears because

he doesn't believe it what he's seeing

is real he thinks he's gonna loosen a

ting oh no I'm sorry and she comes over

and she like starts to kneel down by his

bed but then sees how dirty and gross

the floor is so she kind of like kneels

but with her boots so that they go so

she's like hovering above the ground

that kneeling down yeah okay and she

says I heard you crying what's the

matter he just completely breaks down he

says he just wants to go home he just

wanted to go back to baldur's gate he

doesn't know why he's here why he signed

up for this this was all a mistake this

was all bad he should have listened to

his father

evylyn takes his hand she's like this

was not a mistake you are meant to be

here for you are babes and the light of

the righteous helping hold back evil you

are the key and you are wanted and

appreciated and I kind of him looking at

his leg while I'm saying that does it

look like it looks like it's causing him

a great deal of pain it's all sort of

discolored it was obviously set by

somebody who doesn't know what they're

doing and had no magic I I say the

morning Lord is with you and I lay on

hands for like 10 HP but I do it like on

his leg all right yeah you see all the

discoloration just evaporates from his

leg and his bones sort of magically

gently knit together and almost

instantly he's just the relief the

physical relief that the pain is sort of

subsides and he's able to move his foot

and he just he's like

he smiles for the first time is like he

never expected to feel that again

I like touch his face I'm like what is

your name soldier

he says Galef Calif you are blessed by

the morning Lord and you will be

triumphant

don't let darkness choke out the light

within you you hear in the background

why and yeah he he does he tells you

that his family in baldur's gate there

his his father is a merchant and he was

basically working for his father for a

number of years and when he goes back

there he doesn't want to go back it was

just he doesn't want his father to hear

that he failed here you're not failing

as far as I'm concerned

looks like you're given life limb these

guys thank you so much I he's gonna rest

awhile and then I might get up and walk

around that sounds real nice you rest

now and she kind of just Pat's him on

the head you come out and then he says

tell your friend

my last name is tor FINA okay I'll tell

him paulten his last name is Safi no

those aren't real words all right all

right so you're all back outside again

waiting you don't have to wait long

before captain the the young woman with

the the bloody bandage on her arm and

shoulder comes over to you and she's got

a rolled up big rolled-up piece of paper

and she comes to you and says I'm

captain Sal Hana you didn't get a proper

welcome back there but welcome to this

mess we call camp engine

and then she unfurls this piece of paper

and she says here is a record where some

of our other sorties have gone and she

points to certain things here's camp

Angela what I'd like you to do is do a

wide range arc to the northwest try to

go beyond this lake up through here look

for this river she basically points to a

number of markers that have been

identified see if you can't scout out

this unknown area up in this corner come

back with whatever information you can

provide try to be back before next

evening we'd like a report by then can

do also is your arm okay because it

doesn't look so good it's of little

importance I was bitten on the wall but

other than a slight numbness and

weakness I should be fine

and I've have an appointment to meet

with the priest numbness and weakness

from a by I look at Diaz meaningfully

I'm like I don't like bites but I know I

don't like when other people get bit and

I'm like come here she's standing next

year even like who lays on hands on her

arm okay you're giving your hip points

are you trying to like relieve disease

user oh yeah I'll do that instead of

that's five okay for me yeah that burns

five okay yeah you can see it once you

administer the healing she she's able

the the the pain sort of so he can sort

of see it kind of changes her her

posture and whatnot and she looks at you

when she says I'm sorry your your priest

I am a servant of the morning Lord

levander who smiles down upon this place

with his whole healing right thank you

very much for all that you've done and

all that you will do and I apologize for

commander break bones bluntness he's

new to this kind of thing and why was he

being me he doesn't like he doesn't like

teeth wings oh right do it he likes a

lot of deer dislikes a lot of things

that aren't like he told us to kill all

these different things they're like kill

this kill them like why he's like Kosar

different how's the team playing string

she's very used to this she was like oh

yeah whatever in spring she says but

don't worry about it he and at that

point she says if you need any

additional provisions you can get them

from the crates outside the command tent

I don't know what you have and just make

sure that you're stocked with food you

have enough water we will that dragon

that be going with you mm-hmm

all right busy yes yes you know thank

him yeah I would like that please

is there any chocolate in the provisions

and if so death will you eat it and tell

me what it tastes like um she says I

don't have any but I have an authority

that captain fire beard might have some

hidden in his tent I'll see you

we don't I like fire beard even we don't

be any chocolate if we don't need to

indulge ourselves when they're already

stretched so thin in both manpower and

supplies right can you tell me how you

remember chocolate taste I remember it

tasting just like chocolate yeah I

remember that too you yep all right and

she will roll up her map and walk back

to the command tent all right I took a

student notice of all the markers as you

pointed out as the evening starts to set

in you see there's a couple places where

there's little clearings where some of

those soldiers have been tasked by fire

beard with getting fires going bonfires

essentially

for cooking all right

I've been help with that and you should

like teeth wings at one point you see

coming out the back of the command tent

as camp commander break bone and he's

just sort of pausing out here and he

just lights a pipe and he's smoking and

he's watching the fires being built and

he's watching the guards doing whatnot

he's watching a guard over next to the

outhouses in a corner basically just

throwing up and he sort of casts a

disapproving glare at that individual

but pays know doesn't even doesn't even

look in your direction paulten you know

what you should do for morale because

everyone's so sad you should play a

concert or like that dude's beard on

fire all right so palton goes through

the mud relieving asylum behind you to

take in your drink with you taking with

all right yeah basically I create a sort

of plan or map of the most efficient way

to get you out there all the markets and

areas just like getting a plan for us

tomorrow and get the follow through on

yeah you can see that the gardens don't

have a ton of food to go around so it's

kind of being rationed out between them

but the one bit of humor the one sort of

radiant bit of light here is that they

do get a chuckle over the fact that they

don't have to share with quite so so

many as they used to it is pretty dark

yes and they will be prettier if we go

from the fire to allow a barrel of water

where they can basically dump their

canteens or mugs or whatever they've got

to get fresh water out but man they are

creating wine they're creating a land

when they see Simon there's little ale

keg on their back then anyone do

anything else while the earth is laying

out of course I want to find a match

yeah you could go into a fire like and

like pull out a flaming piece of timber

and she keeps like trying to give them

instruments like hear how the bagpipes

is set you know like when you a kid

wants something and you're like no no

here and you replace it with something

else insurance yeah like he's like got a

flaming torch she's like now that which

takes that away she's like look your new

bulb is that kid the fire pit who keeps

like trying to pull out a stick that's

on fire yeah yeah yeah she's just gonna

walk up to it making the map and just be

like I don't want to die here let's make

sure we don't die here we're not dying

here this isn't our fight it's not like

that guy is real made I agree I don't

like him at all and he they said that

he's new I'm just not sure everything

here is on the level I feel like there

are some things that we don't know I

agree but at the same time that's not

how talkative we have our own things we

got to do no no maybe we can find this

camp and they came out to cover exactly

that's all they need to succeed I am

going to try and believe that oh by the

way the fort before I forget because I

seem to have a problem with this um

paltin MDF and strix your maximum hit

points are each two lower

they were wooden last time yeah that's

right that's that's accounting for the

you guys are sharing the rings of

protection that protect you from the

death curse and come tomorrow morning

you'll be an additional one down okay

did I get the stick on fire yeah yeah

and and you got you got one here that

you can like run away from evil and with

where is he you go stalking through the

camp for the toilet all right um so you

go poking around the camp just make a

perception check to see if you can find

the dwarf before evil and snatches this

thing away from you that is a twelve

okay

you can't find the dwarf since Paulson

won't do a show for them to raise morale

evylyn starts showing everyone like the

two tricks that waffles can do okay you

like watch this waffles

one of the guys very darkly suggest that

maybe waffles would be better as like

fixins that's really afraid so I was

gonna say that that's upsetting kisses

and all those goes with her beak just

here Paulding from the back just like al

bear meets kind of okay you're drunk I'm

fine a dearest person to me I'm like hey

I've seen that that's my beard guys I'm

holding it

he's a friend one of the guards will

tell you that captain fire beard likes

to basically inspect all of the

watchtowers at this time of night

they should make sure they're all clean

and proper and they have all the

equipment that they need and the the

ammunition that they need right I knew

that he asked me to help him I am the

light source but you get the sense after

talking with a couple of guards all of

you and that break bone is the super guy

in charge and then he's got the two

captains Sahana and fire beard fire

beards responsible primarily for defense

and Sal Han is primarily responsible for

the sorties into the jungle and so

puffin goes stalking from one Watchtower

to the next and eventually catches sight

of fire beard on top of the gatehouse

he's talking with one of the guards up

there and of course fire bear can see

you coming palton because you got a big

flaming stick hey buddy

is that for me word gets around you're

trying to light my beer on fire I'm not

letting you up here yeah you are nope

come on old times sake he says maybe you

should go to bed you got a busy day

tomorrow

they just chuck at him like fine

continue living your life stop

no I float away angrily on

or you've already use that today so you

can't use it oh yeah really do not want

to die here alright nights ruined you

guys after after meals everybody goes

back to sleep

guards on duty go up to their

watchtowers and walk vigilantly for

trouble to come but the night passes

uneventful eat and in the wee wee hours

of the morning there's a bugle sound

that wakes you all and it's really quite

loud and obnoxious and then as you come

out of your tent now you can see dragon

bait is out there he's all ready to go

you couldn't even see umbral is talking

to him near the smoldering remains of

one of the campfires you can see she

looks exhausted and going all night

jennife and yeah and then a guard comes

over to her and they start talking about

burial detail and she says that probably

best if they talked to the commander

about that but she looks at you and she

manages a smile and she says I hear

breakbone talk to you into doing that

Patrol yeah he was convincing yeah he's

something isn't he he says just between

you and me I think there's something

else going on here something doesn't

feel right something else like what yeah

his bones are fine

I don't know I'm gonna try to get to the

bottom of it today now but most of the

guards have didn't at least healed

things should be a little bit calm out

here windows break bones start here

he came shortly after the construction

was completed he is a noble he's not

actually military trained as far as I

can tell that's bad news anyway he's

been here almost a month the conflict

with the groung started after he showed

up I think we should try and figure out

what's going on with the ground first

none of this adds up we looking at the

massive place they've looked before this

all over the place perfectly evenly

teeth wings which means it probably

doesn't like crumb which means you

probably started the fight on his off

possible get the way umbral you've been

gained at soldiers trust so as soon as

you help any of them like don't trust

you trying to learn anything you can't

from them we rely on you to get whatever

information you can in return we'll get

down to the bottom of this together I'll

do what I can and she retreats a few

minutes later you see breakbone again

emerge from his tent but this time he's

got fire beard with him and they seem to

be having an argument mostly about

defenses and the fortifications in the

fort you can tell that breakbone is

basically busting fire beards balls for

doing a piss-poor job of keeping the

place secure and then it comes up in the

course of the conversation that one of

the guards is missing

ie it might be a wall slipped out in the

middle of the night you can't catch all

the details but you sort of get the

thrust of it happens not in this camp

apparently anyway I mean I'm not gonna

interrupt him yeah oh yeah the the dwarf

the dwarf contrite goes sort of stopping

off fuming and the commander goes back

into his tent after nothing is really

settled between them but you can see the

dwarfs rage is barely contained and

that point Sahana comes out to you from

her tent and says you'd best be off if

you're gonna get back by evening she's

ready we don't have a whole lot of time

let's go all right

you are let out my dragon bait through

the gatehouse and then you begin to

chart through the wilderness to the

northwest dragon baits got his sword out

and he's a hacking stuff out of the way

to clear a path ahead of him and you

leave camp vengeance behind I'm riding

on waffles ah good call yeah waffles can

easily manage this terrain I'm also

telling her about Morning Glory because

I'm like you were real little when when

Morning Glory was around but she she was

a mount that I had before I could ride

on you because you're so big now and I'm

sure maybe we'll see her again now that

I know that will senator loves me and

it's okay to call her but I'm just

trying to think of the best time to do

it and you're really gonna love her she

and I just go into a description of her

and I'm just talking to almost all of us

cool because I used up my mandolin fly

time you'll have it we'll have it

actually again today because it's a new

day but they it lasts I think your

flight lasts what an hour so you can fly

you can use the spell once per day and I

think it lasts an hour sorry ten minutes

well then in the interest of conserving

the spell I just kind of I'm just kind

of holding my mandolin between my legs

just like making sounds do all right

Astrix are you trudging along with them

are you on the broom yeah once you get

past the areas okay I am thinking like

very detailed notes whatever these are

maps that you do once you get a few

hundred yards away from the camp you are

in jungle and it starts to become quite

deep and the terrain becomes very uneven

obviously they picked a place for the to

build the camp that was flattened by the

river and easily excessive

as a supply line but the surrounding

jungle is actually the land falls away

in a number of places into great ravines

and gorges and some of that terrain kind

of defines how you move and you have a

map that shows a lot of these features

that you have to kind of navigate around

suffice to say your path is not a

straight one it's a winding one and

often going up and down under trees that

can be as high as a hundred feet or more

and as you make your way along DF you're

the mappers you're gonna give advantage

on dragon baits survival checks to the

path and he guides you faithfully as far

as you can tell he doesn't miss a beat

or stray from the track even once you

stop for lunch by a small creek with a

waterfall where you can get fresh water

and then it starts to rain in the midday

and the rain just comes down in barrel

loads for a good long time and then in

the late late afternoon you come upon a

jungle where the light only filters in

through thin narrow little beams and

there are berry bushes growing rampant

all over the place and they smell so

sweet it's almost sickening here because

there's so many twelve and I can I roll

survival suits double check burner oh it

would be a nature attack actually never

mind

so my nature is not with your twelve you

know that these are just sweet tasty

berries they don't have any magical

properties but you think that they're

used to make wine and a very what you

assume to be a very very tasty wine I

just like tocome to put some in some

bottles so forget about

all right yeah yep but you also strikes

with that roll find a weird twisted root

next to one of the berry bushes when you

rip that out you think it might have

some properties that you could tap into

as far as dealing with or curing poison

a little bit further down the woods

become so dark that a lot of there's a

lot of dead wood around here or fallen

trees and things that have all sort of

rotted out and are covered with moss and

mushrooms lots and lots of mushrooms and

strix if you want to make it if anybody

wants to make another nature check you

can ascertain of these oh you said the

right name first growing on the rotted

wood of these dead trees are mushrooms

called Zabu and what's interesting about

that is if crushed or struck they

release spores and these spores are

poisonous so they're like little

mushroom grenades basically awesome yep

I want some and you can find it you can

find about 20 of these things the thing

that the dangerous part is you have to

carry them properly or they'll blow up

like if you fall and you'll surround

yourself with a spore cloud you know I

will not be to carry on because I'm

pretty sure that wouldn't hurt me

everybody make perception check to see

if nothing else do you want a perception

yeah perception from everybody to see

what else you notice in this rotting

blade yeah let me show you

holy well I got pluses hold on I

got 19 thank you sixteen sixteen got

y'all beat that's the only that's

trashed good Strix

you see up in the trees you are not

surprised when poisoned arrows start to

rain down on you from above

oh good and because you saw them you're

able to alert your friends fire like a

die yep oh okay so as arrows rain down

evylyn you are hit by one for one point

of damage

ah blink and you don't have to worry

about any other effect no oh I forgot to

add the bonus it's actually it's four

points of damage

what yep that's still nothing to you

Jared

you two are hit by an arrow for for

seven points of damage

yep and I need you to make a

constitution stating true

no because yours no you weren't

surprised yes you can okay good alright

you take three and I need a constitution

saving through with that big lumbering

die of yours alright you are not

affected by the poison and then Strix

you are hit by one arrow for nine that

one gets you good and if you could make

a constitution saving for her that would

be awesome

seventeen you are fine and Pulteney you

two are hit by one arrow and this one

does six points of damage are they

standing close enough to me that they

get any benefit the arrows seem to have

originated from a point eighty feet away

and up in the trees no I mean all your

friends yeah cuz they're if are they

within five feet of me no okay Dragon

Boat just checking okay well dragon bait

is in my aura in my protection fighting

style though oh that's great then as an

arrow comes down for him you just sort

of bat it out of the way yeah I get to

impose disadvantage on the attack yep

yep his missed because of you ha yeah

you did you totally did how did you do

when you're saving throw their strikes

where I'm sorry yes then you get to add

your +5 Oh

so twelve twelve great then you are

successfully able to repel the poison as

well things things like aura I'm just

saying eh I always poison my own body

Simon is hit by an arrow and it sticks

in him when you just saw it he doesn't

sure it sticks um rate in that Chastain

just kind of goes you good and then

waffles is hit by three arrows no I'm

sitting on waffles that's Laura so yeah

so we were all all of him was alright

she's hit by two arrows instead like yep

so you deflect one of them two of them

hit and

she succeeds at both of her saving

throws versus the poison use your

reaction so if I already know it is a

reaction yes yes so you could only do it

to a DF so I have to make another rule

so she takes a bit more damage but still

repels the poison all right so after

getting shot with three arrows waffles

is angry don't you try to figure out

where it came from so let's roll

initiative everybody come on let me

enter how did you do six total okay

6:30 18:30 Strix Wow eleven eleven all

right

DF what would you like to do all right

so do we have a general idea where these

arrows came from they came from up in

the trees when you look up you can see

because they had to reveal themselves

that there are these powerful tree frogs

upon the limbs of the trees about 80

feet above you and they're not all on

one tree they're basically on three

different trees and a triangular

formation like they basically got you in

their triangle and they're shooting down

at you from different angles they have

short bows yes damn it 80 feet huh yep

you can see that most of the ones that

you see you're sort of a very very

bright green color the fact that there's

at least one or two that are a gold or

orange color how many there are um

they're pretty bright even up in the

shady trees you can count what looks to

be about a dozen all right I'm gonna use

my cutting action to - okay and to

whatever a smaller cluster of them is it

was only a serious tree nearby oh yeah

there's like four in each tree okay I'm

gonna head to one of them using a

second-story of work to just go right up

that tree super quick

okay but I'm scaling the tree on the

side that puts the other groups of frog

people coming I'm gonna show the tree so

I know he's using the tree for cover

against the other two groups got a cover

and you can run up you can move your

full speed right yeah yeah so you can

move a total of 60 feet up the trees

here about 20 feet below those groans at

the end of them yes like chocolate or

branch like swinging up up onto it and

like leaving office and then you've got

your - - right yeah so you're gonna get

today all right yeah because you can

move use your action that's 30 plus 30

plus - let me get I'll get up to 60 okay

and then once enough - they're like hop

up around the screen kind of like swing

around the whole trunk and then come

back around yeah okay do you want to so

on this particular tree that you're

attacking there's an one orange growing

three green ones Orange because he

stands out more yep all both the D

forcement ones so it's a total of seven

okay you wound him and he is still still

like the fight Strix what do you do on

your turn three groups of groans eighty

feet above you four per tree and they

don't speak common you were told that

they don't speak in languages that they

know back at the camp I would I wanted

yeah I'm gonna try and turn yellow them

I want to try and get their attention

and just like oh you've got their

attention all ready to break leg or Bend

leg or what's-his-name falls event or

remember something it's something

deceiving okay

so are you trying to then persuade them

yeah okay go ahead make it a

disadvantage because you don't share a

common language okay you don't get any I

mean they're looking at you with these

froggy eyes so you know right you're not

sure what they're thinking exactly but

there's no change in their demeanor as

far as you can tell and paltin what do

you do i let's see how far are they

they're Shanee feet up okay cool and

there's a there's at least like two

right next to each other right yes are

they remember the description are things

all a crown to one dress coming on know

what

they are in fact humanoid to so they

would be affected by the spell cool i

want to watch a frog fight all right we

got a saving throw coming ooh

we were natural too so yeah frog fight

brewing so question for you on that tree

you targeted there's three green drums

and one orange run do you have a

preference for who gets madness let's

have the hmm

i want i would like to think that the

one that is different is like special so

maybe he's like strongest so that's my

champion great okay so yeah there's a

madness

orange guy is mad excellent

and I just like managed to my power I'm

like y'all check this out Simon just

looks at you and like points to the

arrow in his chest just like SWAT it off

yeah yeah you're totally good okay

he feels much better now next up is the

groung DF the one that you wounded just

oh that's because your initiative is low

yeah so the grunt that you wounded DF

leaps from his higher branch down at you

with a dagger out it's like an

impressive-looking job yeah yeah this is

like a super poison frog jump I could I

could do it he will be 19 on the die

post five is twenty four so he stabs you

for a for piercing damage

[Music]

it's like frog do you f you

this is technically a new round so you

can use them Kenny diamond okay alright

then make a constitution second row you

haven't gone yet that's true yes please

ten all right then you take an

additional five points if he's not

within ten feet or you know I scare it

away

oh dang yeah he's up a tree sorry way to

go that's it my microphone so you take

another five poison damage on top of

them I'm Kenny Dobbs the poison in my

veins

my atom yeah okay so use your own code

for that and the three other groung in

the tree I'll try to pick you off with

their arrows they're gonna be a

disadvantage because they don't want to

hit the everybody but they all miss you

the other groan are going to rained

arrows down upon the Strix because they

don't know that they thought they were

through they just assumed you were

cursed it's exactly a stricture hit by

one arrow one arrow does seven points of

damage and another Constitution say

please evil in your protection and you

take the poison damage you're able to

protect dragon bait again

evylyn and but another an arrow gets

through your own defense with a 23 - hu

it hits you for nine out you don't need

to make us anything all right

yep and then the grunt grunt action yeah

all right so yes the orange-brown

attacked one of the green groans wounds

the green run just sort of cowers down

in little ball and starts shrieking

alright

and then it's Ethan's turn finally

alright so you said there's three trees

both groans three trees each has four

runs and at all about eighty feet above

you even hop and they're 80 feet above

me but how far from me oh I'm just gonna

say eighty feet for the sake of

simplicity

oh man that's far that is far how far

can I throw what are you throwing a

mushroom grenade that's too far mushroom

green Deanna's a maximum range of 60

feet a Jabba lair any other hand has a

maximum range 120 feet I don't want no

javelin

I go make a swoop and grab two mushrooms

in my hands and just fly toward the tree

and I'm gonna use my as much movement as

I can and not use an action okay so you

fly 30 right so you can fly 60 feet up

and be 20 feet away from them at the end

of your turn all right yeah also if I

can I don't know where the others are

but if any of them are nearby I try to

go close to them i've got one engaged

with me yes you've got an orange one

stabbing you with a dagger all right and

you're like yelling at you and some

weird frog or mojo yeah I'm sure he's

real grill so I can't hold them off of

like the arm like my left forearm as I

reach for my sword so I can try to stab

him with it okay yeah that's not fancy

at all 9 hmm 9 is not a hit your sword

does not find flesh yeah sorry I was

getting my burning so as soon as I

realize they don't speak I'm just like

[Laughter]

hey one fireball can get all the groung

and one tree yeah yeah you want to get

the groung in D s tree or the ground

warp Alton is orchestrating a fight or

or the third tree how many Greenstreet

four including the one he's fighting and

in the other tree four and four okay

I'll get the one in da Street first so

they all right they're taken care of all

right

a familiar green a phoniness fireball

goes off all around UDF catching your

buddy and three groung shooting arrows

at you above I like to imagine lawless

fending him off I actually knew this

fireballs yes

oh good news strikes they all fail their

fireballs um the three green grun in the

limb above you dia they're all too blown

away by the flames their ashes fly

through the air and they don't even so

much as other screen than the orange one

is just burnt absolutely black and you

think he like he's just dead in the

standing in front of you but then you

realize he's got like just the barest

amount of life still left in his body

there's just copious amounts of smoke

coming off of them and all this flashing

red and his eyes you barely see up yeah

his his short bow is then destroyed he's

just got a blackened dagger and uh yeah

and so it is palton Stern so Colton

you're concentrating on that spell

orchestrating lose this battle royale on

that tree limb yeah I assume you're

gonna maintain concentration yes I am

okay you can probably drink while doing

that yeah make make the fight more fun

to watch yep okay in that case paltin

your guy kills that little green grunt

who doesn't defend himself yeah any

other two wrong scamper away from him

realizing their little leader has gone

insane every case is after them instead

of saying something wrong it all

recognize like it's fine it's fine come

here it's safe this guy I may go running

across the land and then running across

another lemon they kind of leap from one

limb to another limb and the whole chase

is on you're crazy the groin is gonna go

after them and try to murder them and

like this of the remaining of the one in

front of UDF will valiantly try to stab

you but only roll a 12 yeah and then the

last tree of groung is going to all fire

at Strix because she throws terrible

magic okay one of them hits you Strix

four six and another saving travel

you good and the last one quit you for

nine oh and another saving throw 18

Jesus good job

vivillon then you're 20 feet away from

the ones raining down death upon Strix

yet to those who are not working on so

the other fresh tree of grog just like

[Music]

yeah the just make a ranged attack role

using your dexterity modifier 14 okay

they both go off there's a cloud of

spores all around them and then you see

the groung they sort of look around

completely unaffected and then their

little tongue sort of dart out eat

something spores all right and yes you

do

finish off this orange birds bastard in

front of me yeah all right well here we

and this one hit point aren't going to

fair to us last version okay

three by fourteen damage so then like it

so like every doesn't scorch I was kind

of fighting them off it's like damn but

wait until I side of the ribcage thanks

turn them and like use my foot kick them

off her sword and slide the body so he

falls down and lands in front of the

walkers

oh okay yes waffles is fine is it

venomous or poisonous this different it

doesn't matter too awful yeah these

creatures are actually poisonous but

yeah well waffles Constitution saving

throws pretty darn good yeah yeah and

it's been cooked they've been thoroughly

cooked it's like because you know burnt

we've seen her eat way worse things yes

sir yep and then Strix

oh yeah your turn how many you're like

now well let's see you don't worry about

the ones that pulse and took care of

there are just the four up in the

undamaged tree the ones who are

surrounded by little claws of spores

right I'm sorry audience have you hear

me sniffing it's because my um I've got

a cold and I took medication but it's

more enough now and I can feel it my

head is my head is just filling up with

you Vica oh you're struggling though big

nevis coming out my ears in a minute

that's the worst you know what your eyes

we think and that's just like up and

I'll just fireball let's go home alright

three of them failed all this time

and I'm just like sorry what's the

damage 29 oh my gosh okay so the three

green brown are blown to bits

the orange groung is badly wounded and

so he is now really the only one left

and paltin you can see the drugs that

you are the one that you drove mad is

still chasing the others through the

trees and they're sort of meeting

they're going off and away from you at

this point cool

do you want to do anything or keep the

spell going is that your plan yeah I'm

liking that yeah it seems you were

working pretty well for you and actually

you see didn't get it go you want him to

do it is there anything in shooting

distance no then there never was they

were always far enough away that they'd

rather the range of his Dart

Simon why all right the last drum is

going to try to get away you'll be in

leaping through the trees the wounded

one who just got blasted by that fire

ball since the owner left he's not

sticking around and yeah so he begins to

bound off which brings us to evil by the

way evil and you notice that they're

small and they're agile but they're not

faster than you their speed is actually

slightly slower than a normal human well

I would back to hurt my friends and I

know I'm not super rangy so I'm gonna

make sure that I'm right next to are

they are you guys clogged up anymore are

you kind of all over the place I'm still

a tree

you still in a tree but Strix and paltin

waffles and Simon and dragon beta are

all basically together okay I goes back

to sit on waffles protect our little

girl and then that probably doesn't use

more than thirty feet right no that's

you got look at this bear so then I'm

gonna take a javelin out and be like

kind of blow the dust off it let's check

it out the flea I wanted uh No

aren't there some cell on a tree no oh

then nevermind I don't do anything it's

running away yeah it seems to be okay I

thought that one tree was stuff alright

then I don't I just pet waffles

reassuringly

well she munches on on frogs um the as

you do that and yes you can make it way

back down the tree if you want or do you

want to do something else I'm gonna take

notes oh so it's like several kind of

all retreating yep they're the welders

there's one who's madly chasing after

the others trying to murder them in fact

you see him jump on the green ones back

and stab it to death he's got a crown of

madness around his head that you

recognize it anyway but there's a fleet

but there is a fleeing one there's a

fleeing one going in a different

direction yeah okay yeah I know what

directions are going and when I take

mental note of that cuz I feel like

that's where we're gonna go next okay

maybe extremely chase that maybe we'll

check everyone first make sure we're all

okay alright as you look around and see

danger um dragon bait taps

halten on the shoulder and points and

palton where he's pointing you can see

he just uses a sword to point basically

you can see coming out of a berry bush

nearby is a tiny than a foot tall grun

and it's purple like the right bright

purple almost lavender like a child frog

it looks like a like a young drunk and

it just sort of comes out of the bushes

and blinking eyes dude he seems very

curious in his move cautiously he's

looking up alright so what's going on
