oh wait that's right I came back and

they can't watch they also posted almost

like 2,000 mics are on they know

everything know what I'm scared

four three two hi everybody and welcome

to guys camera action dance man we say

yes good after after a brief hiatus

we're gonna jump right in so previously

in Dyson action

evylyn took the remains of simon AKA

murder bot to a retired dwarf engineer

and toymaker named master Tyron flame

bein the dwarf spoke in murmurs but did

remark on Evelyn's beauty after

sacrificing herself to save her friends

d athens tricks

evylyn was rescued from the clutches of

the soul monger by palton in spirit

Raven form and her soul somehow became

trapped in master flame Bane's construct

which or a striking resemblance to her

all right for those of you who are

joining us for the first time thanks I'm

glad you're all caught up

okay so Before we jump to evylyn and

Alton I'd like to go back to the other

part of Citadel ad bar where the ritual

was performed there after a blinding

flash of light subsides the body of

evylyn is gone

and all that you Strix and you DF can

see as you stare across from each other

is a the body of dr. Rudolf van rycke

tan lying on the floor still clad in the

heavy leather robes and is hood sort of

askew and you can see you can't tell

right now instantly whether he's alive

or dead the other thing you notice as

you begin to move around or get up from

the chairs that you're in is that there

is something glowing on each of your

hands where the gold ring for the ritual

was placed and you see it as the ring

itself it seems to have absorbed a lot

of the gold and dawn light that washed

over

evylyn until she disappeared and those

those glowing rings gradually begin to

the light begins to fade and subside

until they become mere gold rings and

yet you feel like there's some power

trapped inside them now that wasn't

there before I don't like how shiny it

is the gold light seems to fade even as

you watch it uh

Jasper dimmer Kasim a dwarf friend of

yours whom you rescued throws open the

door to the room and you can see waffles

is with him your baby he'll bear pet and

he is he obviously knows something

happened and he begins to scan the room

for trouble and then sees van Brickton

on the floor and then turns to you and

just sort of uh can I jump down and go

check if he's dead yeah you can make a

medicine check alright I'm not actually

like caring a lot I'm just kind of like

I don't I don't really want to deal with

a body right now on top of everything

else so while she does that

um I mean they're 2df ostensibly

everything went as planned so he just

knows that evylyn is now gone and you're

like yes sees the ring on his hand sir

he just silently collapses down to his

knees a strict season and she's like

she's not God she's not got wit look

there's she's in the celestial plane I

know where that is we'll find it we just

have to find another gate I can find one

it's fine she starts like so like as

she's like explaining this or rifling

through man victims to see if he's live

in a little 13:13 is enough to confirm

that yes he is alive but as you kind of

turn him over a little bit um you can

see and you pull the mat you pull the

hood off his head and he looks

disheveled and pale but he was wearing

goggles tinted goggles and you can see

that they're all sort of smoky and

opaque oh that's weird

oh just eyes burst does he have eyes

anymore when you pull the goggles off

the smoke just sort of billows out of

his empty eye socket I drop them and

then he just sort of gasps yeah

obviously still very much alive but

clearly without eyes at this point oh uh

not to alarm you but uh your eyes are

gone yeah he is uh he is barely

conscious and not he can't even respond

to you his voice just sounds parched

cracked and unable to say anything

office this is so bad I'll take part of

my robe and just kind of tie it around

his okay his I like a little like like

blind beer yeah you tear off a piece

your robe or whatever some moths fly out

wrap it around his head tying around his

eyes not the best to put on an open

wound but you know what I'm trying to

best it yes and Jasper kneels down

beside you and he has some clerical

ability and when he looks at the eyes he

tells you that there's not much he can

do about that um he doesn't have regen

raishin but he does administer a healing

prayer to then written to undo the pain

and some of the - otherwise that he took

and clearly after this ritual strict

Anaya feel lifted of our death curses

like me yes choking painter exactly the

effects of that horrible horrible death

curse seemed up completely abated well

that's good right

stretched by the way is still talking

and explaining to DF how they can get to

the celestial plane she's just going

through all this she's convinced that it

evylyn isn't gone but there's just a way

they can just go get her back yeah and

yet from what you can tell it's as if

the morning light just sort of claimed

her yeah right

straight up took her away all right

so Jasper starts to being being of a

clerical sort he begins to sort of pick

Van Rycke tan up off the floor and he

sets him down in one of the chairs and

says that he had better get him to a

temple as quickly as possible he hands

by the way waffles back over to you

strings oh good

Strix is just like don't look waffles

yeah waffles you've got her on he got

the Albert on a short leash and R&S

basically I cover her eyes okay so

finally kind of comes to a little bit

after a quick glance around the room and

just kind of openly addresses that not a

silly Strix or Jasper but rather just

the room he just says where is Alton his

absence is completely less you saw last

year saw him he was standing next to Van

Rycke tan dressed up in a raven costume

oh it's gonna be a lot harder to rescue

two people from the celestial plane is

that is that supposed to happen is he

supposed to be gone - I don't think no

wise mcbari's over here is gonna know

anything he's weird who knows I don't

stretch to starts crying

Chris laughs its tricks crying all right

so what did the two of you want to do at

this point

well can we I guess I'll tell Jasper do

you know of a temple that you can take

him to mm-hmm yeah the city of live our

he says has has temples dedicated to

dwarven deities as Muradin and Duma

thine and so on and so forth

clang get in silver beard he will take

been tricked into one of those temples

to see if anything can be done all right

Strix is just like eight to choose one

they're all the same just go all right

so the dwarf the dwarf leads the blind

vampire hunter out of the room before he

leaves uh can I ask does a is Jasper

familiar with this ritual or the

specifics of it or anything no this

ritual that been written performed was

not okay anything that the dwarf would

know about it was I it was an old vez

tani pagan ritual okay got it all right

so you didn't know anything about it so

he doesn't know anything that what

happened or why no okay Nora Nora Nora

can Jasper speculate on what may have

become a palton uh strikes a belt and

leave at some point or did I did I miss

something Strix is too busy drawing on

the slab where Evelyn was sitting with a

piece of chalk and showing you that this

is where you are and it's like a circle

and she's pointing like there's some

mountains and a Sun and it says levander

up here and it says this is where we

need to go we need to find how to get

here and then there's a bunch of

drawings on the bottom that has a angry

little devil face and she's like we

don't want to go here she's just

ignoring you

all right the morning sun has risen and

is casting its light into the stone room

in which you stand which is sort of on

the outskirts of the citadel at bar

fortress you wanted a place where you

could do this that face the dawn Sun and

that was fairly private you wouldn't be

disturbed so you're you're a little out

of the way you know it'll take Jasper a

while to get them written back to the

heart of

Citadel and it will take you some time

as well meanwhile though Strix is

drawing pictures in chalk on the burger

and a DF do you want to wait for her to

explain celestial mechanics to you I

mean yeah I mean yeah that's our kind of

go through everything

not really absorbing all the information

there ok so just it's very frantic but

ok half of it's very like nonsensical to

she's like and then we need to find

maybe maybe like a raccoon skull I don't

know we can fill it with beans and then

we filled with beans then we have to

throw it into this one pile of trash and

then maybe it might take us so our boria

I don't know and she's like still like

going for all this thanks T remember

while you're basically just dumping your

third grade celestial mechanics make a

Arcana check for McAuley so she's like

screaming about beans yeah oh 19 uh you

recall as you're just spouting stuff

suddenly dawns on you in the midst of

this that you may know what happened to

paltin it just occurs to you like a

moment of inspiration

it's a beans because he was because he

in this ritual he was basically playing

a role of sort of a guardian Shepherd to

ensure that the soul got to where it

needed to in the afterlife it's possible

that during the ritual either

intentionally or maybe um haphazardly he

was drawn into the afterlife with Evelyn

and either chose not to return or could

not return all right I will communicate

that to DF and AD so it could be worse I

don't know I guess I wouldn't blame why

would he want to come back oh okay Strix

is gonna shake him really hard and be

like hey why are you being weird

then she'll slap him okay mmm like we

have to rescue our friends and how do we

go about doing that

I just told you involves the skull oh

the beans and finding both of them

you're pretty sure blame you're pretty

sure with your successful Arcana check

that you might be wrong on the beans

she's just pretending it doesn't matter

she knows more than D yet she knows that

 so at this point Deus looks kind

of a solemnly follows Trixie's lead okay

Strix is really mad right now

Strix at what point do you want to leave

right now as soon as he asked acts

solemn at all she's just like yeah and

then Turner

turns around and just like pushes the

door open with like magical force okay

with with waffles bounding ahead of

Strix Strix leaves the room yeah alright

yeah and then dragging this video long

kind of go with her okay

as you make your way back into the heart

of the stronghold and down a hallway

that has these sort of deep set alcoves

with dwarven statues in them you can see

that because this part of the citadel

isn't well lit you need to supply your

own light as you did coming here it's no

big deal you have something to light the

way jays are driven globe or that yes

you may end up your Strix is drift globe

in her hand or just floating next to her

lighting the way as you go I'd like you

both to make perception checks okay I

like to imagine that Strix just

passive-aggressively like slams the

drift globe in a DF Sam oh yeah twenty

I got a twenty to twenty as well not

every day but as you are both marching

back to the Citadel you suddenly get the

sense that danger is nearby that there

are figures hidden behind the dwarfs

statues in the alcoves threatening

figures the hackles on the back their

neck go up you you might hear something

like a little bit of crumbly stone fall

to the floor that seems out of sorts

what do you do

I'm just stopped immediately and slammed

it against the wall yeah like at that

point uh D if it's like you've also like

very clear this so like I'm not really

looking at Strix but kind of looking

around um he started

a hand on the hilt of the sword okay

then you are not surprised when slinking

out from behind the statues into the

Hall are four creatures that look like

that they look so nice for those the

Noles and we're looking for Knowles

you're looking at bugbear a bugbears

okay yeah be nice they don't have like

tank yes these bug bears come out and

despite their size being about seven

feet tall they move with a quiet stealth

that is quite unnerving all you see is

their eyes and fangs and their big

pointy ears bear down on you and they

raise heavy morning stars black bears

doing down here that's definitely weird

that is a fair question

and one of the bugbears says in common

the flasks give us a flask I was talking

about uh what and at that point he looks

your confusion seems to register on his

face a little bit and he reaches into

between two pieces of his armor and

pulls out a crumpled up piece of paper

and growls and grunting he actually puts

his weapon knife against the wall when

he realizes he can't unfold the page and

he starts to unfold in his big furry

fingers this little piece of paper and

hmm gets frustrated and then finally

gets it open looks at it and that turns

it to you opens it turns it to you and

you see it is a charcoal sketch of the

magical iron flask Wow oh that flask

then he crumples it up and throws the

paper down on the ground

flashed strikes will say it's it was up

in the mountain when it exploded that it

was the where the fire Giants just left

it up there was up there

lies yesterday's you're not good at that

dan shut up all right

they begin to beat on you I'd like the

two of you truly initiative I'd see if

it if you're gonna lie don't give them

more in aviation than necessary when we

say you're bad at lies I got three okay

23:23

DF you react more quickly than they do

all right wonderful uh there's four of

them there are four of them how close

are they to me they are all within 10

feet of you two ahead of you and two

behind you all right I got the ones

behind and then of like a kind of

about-face lunge forward with a short

sword and just engage whichever one okay

alright so this is the first attack of

the stream I'm gonna make it special

so while Holly was at the origins event

with you Chris last weekend she went and

got me a special gift it's a new die set

yeah it's the suck this is a d20 made of

actual amethyst that's cool sure I got

the whole set which is super cool since

oh no debt has that piece of amethyst

yes around his neck so yes that's also

cool there we go first first MSSD 2002

please don't be a one oh my god there's

no way there's no way hold on I gotta

show it I'll fish it's freaking twenty

okay Ian I think the odds aren't even

know I'm ship dice Oh

so ah take that chat all the people who

are like here comes a one

we've suffered enough time that's so

awesome

alright never roll that guy again Jared

yes die up end on a high note

yeah alright this is not a sneak attack

just got a critical hit right uh that is

correct

alright so then I'm hitting for total of

13 13 points yes alright that bug bear

is quite wounded by your attack and they

go next two of them will attack UDF okay

uh one of them rolled a 22 hit mm-hmm he

does 13 points of damage with his

Morningstar and that gets the uncanny

dodge okay

so six so uh that surround allows round

down yeah right so six the second one

swings and only rolls a seven so you

easily dodge out of the way of that one

Strix two of them attack you since you

haven't acted yet they actually get

they're actually a little bit more

accurate because you're kind of

flat-footed one in the layest one of the

rules in eighteen oh yeah they get me

for sure okay it does 18 points of

damage all right and then the second one

is also going to hit you and it's going

to do 20 coal damage

great so you are knocked about and I am

very mad catz and Strix you're up on

your turn you can see that waffles is

sort of hankering or tugging on the

leash to get at one of the bug bears

yeah

good alright well first thing I will let

waffles go and just go go my feet okay

she immediately bolts and tries to bite

one of the bug bears on the leg and I'll

have you roll a d20 for me

okay calling

oh I got 20 oh yeah what are you joking

this is impossible we've been dreading

this day but it's actually filled with

happy how what no way I know okay nights

roll to d4 for a crit wall right first

ever attack roll huh my little girl haha

uh to d4 she got a four okay that's okay

cries out in pain and starts to hop up

and down as block against the poor from

his thigh she's super happy and for her

yeah and he sort of reflexively kicks at

waffles no waffles kind of nimbly gets

out of the way and then it's all grown

up and yeah killing out all right Strix

what do you do oh um I am going to go

ahead and is there any place that I

could perhaps misty step in this whole

way are we yes you can miss the step

outside of combat in either direction

sort of back the way you came or okay

Edward where you want to cool and that

would be my bonus action so yeah I'm

gonna go ahead and do that just back

away from their combat area yes and then

you want to go so back toward the way

you came

yeah back towards the way I came looks

like what just like back it up

yeah and then I'm going to careful spell

firebombing okay and because I'm angry

so yeah a big fireball goes off all

around UDF flames swirl but dude easy to

it yeah quite quite used to it at this

point really yep waffles used to it to

shizer applause just what is it the

flames all around her all right

a31 ow and what's the safety see save DC

is 16 now okay all of the bugbears were

able to dodge it and take half damage

so they take sorry you said 31 31 yeah

so 15 points of damage that kills the

one that you attacked earlier DF get rid

of us and all

all of the others are now quite wounded

hopefully it alerts some dwarves to to

our predicament yes there is a big rush

which will carry some distance it

alright and uh Anna yes you see yourself

in the mirror but it is not you it is a

facsimile of you a lightness an effigy

I've gone struct moulded in your image I

have so many questions Chris Perkins how

as I look in the mirror

yes and I'm used to the way that my face

moves how expressive is my face doesn't

move do I have one like jaw movement

do I have expressions you can see that

there is the face does the the whatever

your face is made of it's a supple

material and it seems to stretch and

contort as you make expressions so you

wouldn't say that they're natural but

they're close okay uh when my breath

catches in my throat and I I kind of I

go to like ah you know do I do I feel

like I can talk like normal yes weird

how does it feel it feels odd in fact

when you inhale you can you can see that

you you get the sense that inside you

somewhere is some sort of almost like

bellows like mechanism or some uh deep

within you that you can you can feel it

moving and you can actually kind of just

barely hear it yeah um do I have a sense

of tactile feeling you sort of reach out

for the nearest thing a wall brace

yourself against the wall or a bench or

something it's not sense you don't feel

sensitive fingertip touch it's like

touching it with a club I kind of like

gasp and cry out at that

um and then as I'm like doing this and

trying to touch things do I immediately

feel like I have a normal command of my

body or is it kind of like learning and

new it's like walking on heels for the

first time in your life you're a little

bit wobbly at first just trying and then

very quickly however you can see that

the body is cooperating with you um and

you can hear very very faint little

noises and there's little tiny clicks

and things as your limbs are moving

around oh okay and um I definitely feel

different um but do I have a sense of

like if I well maybe this maybe I'll

find this out later so let me know if

it's just a later thing but do I have a

sense that my spells would still work ah

you don't know okay last question am i

wearing clothes uh yes you are not a

naked robot okay they look like my old

clothes yes in fact they look like they

were procured from the same local tailor

as your old clothes oh he made me like a

real doll so gross

and then the joy maker Joker is still

snoring on the other side of the

workbench kind of his head sleeping on a

desk on until the desk surrounded by

little bits and pieces of wire and metal

and shaved off wood and stuff and

between you and him lying on the floor

you can see paltin in full raven costume

you haven't yet checked to see whether

he's alive or dead right um this is

after we last week there was the brief

moment where she kind of reached out for

paltin saw her own hands and kind of

like coiled and screw yeah yeah so she's

already recoiled she's kind of looking

at politics she's looking around the

room and then like slowly takes one step

slowly takes another and then starts

like full-bore just like stomps over to

this dwarf grabs him by the scruff of

the neck or like by the collar

lifts him up off the table I'm assuming

I still have the same amount of crazy

strength yeah and like shakes him and

just like through her teeth whatever

that sounds like as a robot says what

have you wrought shakes him answer me oh

you can see he's still kind of waking up

startled his eyes starting all over you

looking into your eyes and he says do

you usually good you thank you it's very

beautiful what what are you saying what

have you done where's my son

you can see just in his expressions you

can make an insight check to sort of

gauge what he is thinking I'm using my

stream of annihilation dice okay first

role in this one - am I gonna get lucky

mmm nope I rolled a three which means I

have a what was I really in sight so

eight okay you can hear him mumble here

I don't know what I am but I'm certainly

not alive and I throw him down next to

Paulson and I'm like alright you find

out if he's okay right now uh the old

dwarf will go over and shake paltin

paltin you wake up being vigorously

shaken on the floor you're still wearing

that stupid brave anemic stuffed head so

you can only see out of one eye and as

you look out there's a crumpled up piece

of paper lying next to you on the floor

and the first thing you sort of fix on

is that piece of crumpled up paper and

you can see what appears to be I a hand

scribbled drawing of what looks like

Simon

I'm just gonna grab it take a look at it

like yeah you grab it it is it is a

hand-drawn thing and as evil and watches

paltin come to and grab this piece of

paper the piece of paper is the drawing

that you gave the toymaker of what Simon

is supposed to look like it was a really

good drawing - yeah but yes Pauline does

appear to be alive and paltin as you

look around through the one eye trying

to get your fix on things you realize

suddenly it is a old and by old I mean

decrepit dwarf ooh shaking you awake and

you're lying what appears to be in a

cluttered work room um you see toys on

shelves uh would I know if like for the

for their costume is the head like a

separate hood that I guess you can take

the head off okay I'm just gonna like

shove them off me and just lay okay like

take that off and just like chuck it

okay what you do you see rigored you you

lay eyes on on this construct a standing

nearby that is rendered in the likeness

of evil and yet it seems to be animated

and well hard to tell but kinda looks

angry and completely still like eerily

still do I like uh can i gather that um

so I recognize that it looks like evylyn

you do I gather that this dude probably

made it yes you put the pieces together

really quickly because Elin told you

actually that she had gone to get Simon

rebuilt and that there was an old dwarf

who was going who's doing it so you put

all the pieces together at this point at

least all that one I say to him i and i

keep forgetting his name something flame

Bain tie room you can also call master

flame Baines um

I say paltin this is master flame Bain

who was to rebuild our son Simon and

instead he has done this

and it sounds very much like Evelyn but

there's just something in the voice that

is not quite right that's hollow I just

kind he's kind of like give out the

biggest Hong you've ever done what what

no no no no no no no no no I look to him

I'm just like what you do kind of okay

stupid like tricks are you running on

here and he says just read me something

she heard that place I'm sorry what he

says is very Steven made it's amazing

it's a good you can see a sense of just

alarm on his face like he never would

have expected in a million years that

the thing would have just come to life

like that so what what what game are you

trying to play right now

because you you make this make this

robot

[Music]

you were inspired and you

it's like how did you how did you

leaving like get the voice down like dad

stats the creepy he says do that

inspired even just kind of like sweaters

inspired clock clock clock she shoves

him back over toward pulsing all right

you killed our son and made me into this

you are inspired you old fool

son who you soon what I look at paltin

salmon wasn't our son what do you know

about Simon what do you know about me

obviously a lot physically which is

really creepy yes not that he met he met

you once and was so struck by your

appearance that he's sort of embedded

that in his memory is quite something I

like I turn to him I'm like okay I don't

know what kind of like like weird AI

 you got going on in here but it's

getting convincing and I don't like it I

am NOT a fan of what of your of your

business sir you will get the lowest of

reviews I kind of like I'm kind of like

nope Alton it's it's me it's I guess my

soul I don't I was sent back do I

remember the whole ordeal with the with

the Raven and in the like this you

remember

somehow in the ritual being trapped

basically transformed or becoming an

actual bird and racing forth to snatch

evylyn from the jaws of the sole monger

before her soul was claimed forever

and then after pulling her free

miraculously you were flung away and you

saw evil and flung away from you and

away from her gods which you actually

would not have seen so no you'd but you

saw her get flung away and that was you

convinced that she was safe there was

then a flash of light you appeared in

that weird place for that creature

mm-hmm who gave you that thing which you

realize you're just tripping over now a

severed blackened hand on the floor I'm

gonna I like see it I reach down and

pick it up and just look at it and like

things are just like like piecing

together yeah and I

I look at evylyn see no no no no no no

no that that was a dream that matters it

was real and thank thank you for saving

me from the darkness all although I

don't know whether you should have ah

but thank you but now you have to kill

me if we ever want to get our son back

he's gonna need this body we have to

reanimate this body and this idiot has

to reforge this into the shape of simon

and then we have to do this some sort of

ritual and we've got to bring him back

so you have to kill me so I can vacate

this thing okay we can pull Simon back

in - just do it G like kneels down she's

like do it quick look calm calm it real

quick okay

like I just I was a raven and then very

beautiful as a raven yes thank you I

presume but then there was like a tree

lady and now I have this hand and now

you're right it's been a weird Tuesday

okay

so late I didn't have the pleasure of

meeting the tree lady she wouldn't hit

her up to hang out on weekends

regardless bye - wait I need a second I

need I don't understand I can't I can't

process this and I'm just gonna I'm just

gonna I'm gonna walk out you're gonna

walk out yeah it's like no I'm just like

nope nope nope nope my hand you take it

with you yeah I'm just like nope nope

he's still saying open the hallway yep

all right

Edelen you're by yourself with the

Dwarven engineer as soon as he walks out

even tries to like sometimes when she

overwhelmed she like plops down and sits

cross-legged you know she's basically

like a gymnast like she's very uh agile

and stuff so she tries to just like plop

down cross-legged but her legs like get

tangled and Koch kind of like falls on

her back and then she just like rolls

over and gets pissed off looks over at

this dwarf guy is like I don't

understand the way you talk I don't like

what you've done to be honest I would

like to smash you with my metal hand

that you made why should I not do that

oh she just like rolls her eyes and she

just storms out - she just can't she's

just done do I know where like the

nearest bar is you know where all the

nearest bars are cool I am going to go

to one all right uh Strix make a

perception check oh oh okay

um eh and Strix correct me if I'm wrong

but you have the iron flask it's true I

do it's stuffed in my robes right so

they got a grab for it okay Gabriel

gross a figure that you don't see um and

actually DF I'll have you make a

recession cheque as well okay hey okay I

wish I was bullshitting I really wish I

was but there's another natural Twilight

God so altogether that is twenty nine

Jesus Christ did you wait these dice

ollie like it was it a special present I

use a different dices I use a different

die this time that's twenty every time

yeah so I'm running out of D 20s to use

that'll give me natural 20s yeah your

keen senses you sense that something

else is going to happen in just a second

and you feel a presence a dark presence

in the in the area besides the bugbears

suddenly a figure that was invisible

becomes visible and I should be a

dwarven stature but wearing black robe

and a hood with what looks like almost a

Darth Vader eadvisor

Oh

or the face to conceal the identity of

the individual and that individual

immediately lets loose a lightning bolt

that streaks passed you passed the

bugbears and it tries to hit Strix right

in the chest now there it comes

so Strix I'd like you to make a

dexterity saving through hell oh great

oh cool that's an 11 get full on by the

blast of lightning great you take 30

points of lightning damage yeah I pass

out alright and at that point uh the

dwarf makes a beeline for Strix and I'm

on fire again and says and says

something in goblin to the bugbears DF

do you speak got home alright so she is

able this and uh sound of the voice

coming through the visors clearly female

oh right and that that visored figure

basically runs 2025 feet towards Strix

doesn't get to her this round and at

that point in time the bug bears all

turn on UDF oh and it is your turn um

how far away Strix from me so she she de

mentioned or she missed he stepped about

30 feet away from you sorry to bug bears

you and her that were fighting her and

then she gets hit by the lightning bolts

you just yell sure right away so after

she goes down uh DFA merely just yells

out uh no and like contra in cutting

action disengage it starts making his

way to Strix while muttering unders

brought the entire time just no not

again not again I can't go through this

again okay okay if you disengage that

will be your action oh but that's my

cunning action that sorry Marshall

assassins so as soon as I get to here

I'm just like defensive defensive stance

over her okay if I'm in rage of dwarf or

whatever like I'll certainly attack okay

and just whatever we can to help defend

Strix alright

the bugbears will on their turn come

after you and attempt to attack you okay

one of the mists with a 15 I believe

correct correct

all right the other one rolled a 21 all

right all right

and does nine points of damage with the

Morningstar all right I'll take that

okay

the third one missed with a 14 and the

fourth one missed with a 50 all right

all right so all the bugbears are now on

you trying to beat you down the

Morningstar

when this figure now strikes I need you

to make a death safe as usual oyez 15

all right one success the waffles is

going to come after one of the bus fares

and assign Jame waffles roll a d20 for

me Holly I got a nine okay

this time the bugbear just sort of kicks

her off

oh no not able to sink her beak into the

creature

oh but more importantly I know I have an

ally sure you have an ally within five

feet very good ones the visored dwarf

seeing you standing on top of her is

going to cast a spell on you DF all

right and don't see sea level it up too

little too and you recognize the

incantation as a sleep spell oh crap so

don't fall asleep Jarrod yeah so there's

no save on that just how much for a

comparative hit points yes all right uh

so what are your current hit points

thirty-nine all right the spell does not

affect you damn right you feel a yawn

hmm well that's it all right

and it comes back around to you DF what

do you do Stan

one of these as far as I can

okay well with the assistance of waffles

for a tempting sneak attack yeah all

right I'm using friendship dice Frenship

dice

uh-oh so pretty good uh 24 yes you hit

all right ninety three sixes yeah one

two three four

that's the sneak attack damage and

that's the normal shorts are damage @cq

4 6 10 15 1924 total you murder that out

there and there are only two of them

left both way both of them injured by

the fireball blasts as the two remaining

bear down on one of them is shot in the

shoulder by a crossbow bolt Oh sick you

don't know exactly where it came from

please friendly but the crossbow both

hits it and actually kills it right so a

third bug bear collapses as the button

has the crustal boat almost clears

through its body and as it falls

backward and lies dead on the floor you

can see what appears to be another

shadowy form off in the distance what

can't they be just like light up it's

always got to be shadowing and make a

perception checked yeah to see if you

can recognize any details whatsoever

about this form shadows uh 24 you

believe it is another dwarf okay see you

can see the large crossbow that he's got

um that he just sort of pulls up after

firing it all right

okay and it is a the let's see you just

went

he just went the one remaining bug bear

will attack UDF whether face long yeah

you fight him off uh Strix make a death

safe oh boy oh Jesus Oh twenty I will go

Oh

oh this isn't away you are awake with

one hip points

yay making that pack roll for waffles 17

that hits so roll a D for not doin

waffles doing waffles I got a three okay

uh that bug bear is wounded but still

alive ah the dwarf with the visor so

what panicky now oh dear um she is going

to turn invisible

damn it and you hear her shuffle off

damn it

DF there is one bug bear left standing

over you and strings yeah and he too is

gonna feel like as much wrath as I could

possibly give them so I noticed at this

point that Strix is still okay yes all

right so like Altan ultimate relief

still falls over Diaz but still enough

hatred and rage against the assaulter is

that you just stamps back up as far as

you can

yeah man you get sneak attack on this

guy cuz of walls yeah uh not grade 1414

the bug mare is able to parry that okay

all right all right

the bug bear um well he's gonna just

keep on fighting he'll try to beat on

you again DF but again you easily get

out of the way of his soon and that

brings us to Strix there is a wounded

bug bear standing near you all right as

soon as she wakes up - she's gonna be

like I'm sorry I slapped you that one

time um and I guess I guess if there's a

wounded bug bear near me

yep Oh what should I do I don't want to

overkill on him but I don't see that

dwarf either the one that a lightning

bolt me I'm a little bit more concerned

about that so um I'm going to go ahead

and open the flask and Oh blech Kharak

out okay you unplug it sand begins to

pour out and quick

you assumed the form of your ghoul

friend Iran yeah so justice it's gonna

be like all right sandy there's a dwarf

around here and she's like coughing cuz

like half of her clothes are like burnt

and falling off and she's like it's

inevitable right now just go kill them

please you could see the invisible

people all right so this stone skins

Jeannie uh let me just take a quick look

at his stats here see what he's got in

his bag uh

doo doo doo doo doo doo he is compelled

to obey you for the next minutes

oh sorry our two minute oh I met our

alright let's see what does he go

alright I will do as you ask my dad for

this we are going to have a talk all

right

[Laughter]

he says looks like you and he says so

which way did she go

oh my god I don't know smell her out oh

um oh great so it's just like you

Leatherhead and just hurry she's getting

away

oh my goo go go wandering off make a

perception check to see if he can hear I

see any telltale signs of her he's a

little bit you know looking around in

the darkness his molten gold eyes lit up

looking for any signs um and he kind of

goes stomping off about 30 feet all

right

and then that's you strict's waffles do

you want to if you want to have her

attack uh yeah have her attack the

bugbear good 30:20 roll so fourteen uh

not enough unfortunately all right

really want waffles to have her first

she'll just like cough on him off her

first taste of flesh all right the dwarf

is invisible and doing other things that

figure what the crossbow is going to

reload and crits the bug bear

shooting him through the skull yay walls

to the floor dead all of your enemies

have been slain or driven off at this

point

and you can still hear kharak I'm

totally looking I am doing the best job

what that dwarf is now advancing toward

you you see he just drops the heavy

crossbow and moves toward you with such

purpose it's almost intimidating alright

dudes do we recognize her this is it

when he comes into the vicinity of your

drift globe you can see that he isn't

exactly a dwarf at all he's a little bit

bigger than a normal dwarf and broader

than a typical dwarf and the complexion

of his skin is much more gray dark gray

than most dwarfs you see and he's got a

very strong square jaw with tusks

protruding from his lower from behind

his lower lip and they're sort of

yellowed and stained and his eyes are

bloodshot and his face is his beard is

not fully formed it's patchy in little

clumps here and there on his face and

he's got scars horrible scars criss

crossing his face part of his ear is cut

off on his right side it looks like this

guy's been through a hundred battles and

as he advances toward you and he's got a

leather armor and leather gauntlets he

pulls out a sword ah and holds it up a

threatening Li you can see it appears to

be a short sword that kind of gleams and

catches the light of the direct cloak he

looks like he's going to kill you it

starts just like holding her like fiery

clothes and she's like whoa cutter

please stop don't sit not with the sword

please I mean it's not gonna take much

to give us let's talk first

she's like cosmic like try to get though

like flames out if you want to make a

persuasion check you can

sure I will gladly yeah an inside check

all right I only got a six oh she just

looks messed up inside twelve dafuc he

is not paying attention to Strix at all

his eyes are completely on you what do

you do is he advances threatening Li uh

race look at my store now so I'm so like

defensive mm-hmm but and I just don't

want to try to talk it out first and

just I'll say what's this about why save

us and then approach so hostile um he

doesn't answer until he is within swords

your swords swing of him okay when he

gets up to you her sword swing of my me

too so it's fine yeah

you're both within swords swing of each

other and at that point he says or you

all related off to Ashton Woodrow um am

i yeah you don't know you're an orphan

Ashton you remember your family uh only

barely I remember that I was sold

yes you were uh very sternly did respond

to

I know of no Ashton

he says you look like him Oh too much ah

all right

I mean I don't know the name I don't

know this person why would that garner

such hostility he lowers his sword and

uh and holds it close to him and then

says are you sure it's him though and he

seems to be talking to the sword and

then he holds the sword he turns the

sword upside down blade down to the

floor and holds it out to you take a

toll do it

strike she's gonna walk out the clock

wait I know you don't take remember

don't take weapons from people or

strangers that talk or they're talking

to it can I like our kata check it or

something she's gotta do it okay the

sign sausages you know don't worry

they're your friends in your head echo

through your mind stream Strix as you

inject yourself between look at the

sword with one hit point now exactly

what I'm doing this let me look you can

see that it's got a this gleaming sword

has a black hilt that is sort of

beautifully shaped that ends in a pommel

that has a fox head with a red gem

gripped in its jaws which is interesting

huh you also notice that worked into the

hilt where the blade and the hilt meet

essentially is a keyhole all

you can see ah there are designs and

patterns on this sword that with your

role suggests it was forged in sigil

ah my favorite place search is gonna get

very scared be like oh it's from it just

like mumbles to herself it is like like

the doughnut it's just I can see a

Bissel indentations worked into the

blade abyssal glyphs they spell a word

do you speak abyssal I do speak abyssal

I do yes all right

the word is gutter cutter for the g gu

TT ER like that place you came from Wow

all right well Strix will relay this and

be like oh the fact that it's from

signal might be bad but I guess it's

yours

good ideas will give strikes the most

confused look ever like that's why are

you helping I don't if there's a keyhole

you have keys I I'm just genuinely

terrified that it's from sigil that's

that's where I came for a river that was

a bad place so that I had to Lee and

them you know and you found me he has a

right what is he still handing this

sword to me right yes he is holding it

out to you okay and he seems like he's

in a bit of a daze yeah so if nothing

else he looks like a sleepwalking right

DFK sees this as a means to at least

disarm his opponent okay he'll put his

normal short sword over in just left

hand it'll quickly snatch the other one

away okay you feel just as soon as it

enters your hand that it's a magical

weapon but you can't until you attune to

it you don't know what its properties

are okay as soon as you part with the

weapon the dwarf kind of snaps almost

out of a fugue and just sort of reels

back

and kind of stumbles a little bit in

turns away from you like he was

momentarily disoriented or severed from

some sort of connection and then he kind

of regains his composure and he says no

no that sword is mine oh you can have it

back and uh and then he returns to you

and says forgive me it's not mine

hey y'all or saw a friend an adventurer

hello shares your name Oh were they from

sickle strikes is just gonna like yell

likes to him like he says well oh you

don't know where Saiga lives he shakes

his head never been there the sword is

from there the sword Hall wants to be

with the Woodrow song you spoke of Astin

who was asked him my friend Hall we

adventure Hall together all four years

and he died he dog it gave me the sword

Hall to keep until I could find no is

inheritor

I don't fully understand and he goes

sort of wandering off I'm no let him go

and he picks up his crossbow as he goes

and then you CDF that he very expertly

roguishly so it's appears in two

machetes no dark I like I'm almost

familiar with this technique yes yes

yeah he is definitely a rogue okay and

based on your based on his appearance

you think there what's odd about him is

that he's only half dwarf the other half

orc

evylyn you are you attempting to follow

paltin cuz man he's moving with a

purpose

yeah and I'm like a little bit awkward

too so like I'm kind of like crashing

through like I imagine there's like a

front desk area you know cuz I had

talked to them but well you know and I

actually have to kind of walk through

parts of it like the town part of City

lad bar to follow up Alton as he makes

his way through small crowds to get to

the nearest tavern yeah as you're

walking through the dwarves really don't

pay you I mean you get some glances and

stuff but the dwarves don't pay you a

whole lot of mind you can't be the first

walking construct thing they've seen

moving through here I guess evylyn is

like very surprised and like a little

offended by that but like you know just

keeps kind of just like trucking like

one stiff weird

c-3po step after another toward wherever

peloton way about halfway there you kind

of find the semblance of a gate that's

kind of similar to what you're

accustomed to moving like but it's still

your hearing internally some mechanisms

and things that are enabling this to

happen and that's disorienting yeah that

creeps me out but I just a basically

following palton yeah alright um so

paltin you find are

a joyous joyous dwarven bar full of

copious amounts of dwarven ale I pop a

squat

now I have I have my black severed hand

I just kind of throw up on the bar like

yeah by the time you get by the time you

get there the hand has attuned to you oh

when you plop it up on the bar it's sort

of animates and sort of gets there and

starts to walk around like thing from

The Addams Family

am I like surprised by this uh no you

kinda sense that it might do that I just

kind of walk it like watch a walk back

and forth not eat just like following

with eyes just huh it might like try to

walk up on your sleeve or like a hold of

the one like you're ill mug or something

but it doesn't do anything threatening

to you in fact you get the impression

it's just kind of hanging out with you

hmm

and that and that it will obey your

commands Can I grab my ale and cheers

with it

yeah you can't it can't like physically

levitate like I'm just gonna I'm just

gonna like so clunk mine against it's

like it will crawl up to the top of it

off of its and sort of dip one of its

rotting fingers in yeah sort of squiggle

it around in there and you can see the

bartender catches sight of this thing

for the first time and can't take his

eyes off it and he's just like eyes wide

in horror I see I noticed the the bar I

keep looking at mom just like it's fine

he's on my tab as you walk into the bar

and make your way around sort of bumping

into dwarven shoulders periodically you

might get a dwarf assist in something

like dwarvish watch all your god how

rude um by the way Chris chat adamantly

would like you to move your mic closer

to you

you can I know it might not but um I

could do that cool uh yeah I just go and

I just kind of like I have my eyes on

Pelton and I'm very like slowly just

kind of sitting down next to him and

like folding my hands with a metal e

sound okay now this is the first time

that you see that his rotting black hand

has become animate and is moving around

the bar oh wow

watch it what you got what you got there

paulten I don't even look at her I just

hear I'm just like probably something

else that'll die soon it looks like it

might already be dead huh um what are

you gonna do with it sir

I don't know seems to have something

going on I don't want to get in the way

that so I'll just let him do it seems

chill the hand will come over to you

evylyn and just kind of kind of position

itself in front of you

but it doesn't seem to it doesn't seem

to be threatening if I use divine sense

do I feel like it's evil oh that's a

very good question um so your divine

sense picks up if it's it picks up it is

Undead um now I don't know if divine

sounds such a tell go to needle uh let

me just double check design sense there

it is uh yeah so yes you can decide

strong evil and powerful good you do not

sense evil coming from the hand okay

in fact you kind of sense it's a good

hand huh a good severed undead hand so

I'm kind of like looking at it

skeptically but then as I'm like you're

all right I give it a little like gold

hand fist bump

race let me back yeah I can sort of hop

up fist bump you and land back on its

fingers I like some sky what do you call

him then the name that springs to mind

when you attuned to it is the hand of

hell Nick

hmm but you can call it whatever you

want all them this pops into my head and

I'm just like haven't decided

[Laughter]

are you uh are you okay as a question of

the day isn't it the bar the barkeep

sort of walks by keeps a watchful eye on

the hand doesn't pay you any mind evil

in and doesn't ask you if you want to

drink anything do I find that I do want

to drink anything no in fact you're not

thirsty at all hmm that's too bad uh she

kind of like just sits there kind of

looks at palton kind of looks down and

she's like hmm so about that a-hole

I need to die so we can resurrect our

son thing do you think we could get

around to that soon kind of urgent and I

know you've been through a whole lot

today and you already saved me from

eternal damnation I'm pretty sure but

it's like I don't know if I've even

fully accepted that that is you in there

and if I did what makes you think I

would do that well I just thought it

would be the right thing to do I mean

what about Simon what about him well

this was supposed to be his body I don't

know how else we resurrect him without

this there is a lot of supposed

- going on recently and I'm kind of kind

of over that you know I mean I've got

I've got I've got a little hand friend

al vague I was supposed to have this but

you know what you roll with it

yeah I mean I was supposed to go into

eternal darkness I guess but then you

saved me and she kind of like she looks

around like she's really not supposed to

ask this kind of thing she's like how

did you do that

do what the whole Raven swoopy saved me

from hell thing how did you do it like I

have any idea what happened OST you know

paulten is that this is this was sort of

old mastani magic and although you have

purported ties the Bustani nothing was

ever told you were never told of such

things

hmm look I know is you were gone I was

like real Raven and not I still have the

like neck down right yeah you're like

and not this weird mascot thing Hey I am

a little I'm a little hazy on the

specifics well why did you do it cuz it

seemed like the right thing to do you

always do seem to know the right thing

to do mm-hmm evylyn as you're glancing

around make a perception check okay ooh

um 18 okay and Paulson you can sort of

hear some sort of little whirring noise

from inside your Brandon beside you an

evil and uh you're not exactly sure why

you're sort of glancing around the bar

as you're talking starting your eyes

around and

you do see in a corner of a bar some

rowdy Dwarfs and probably the sound of

them is what initially caught your

attention but you can see there their

drunken having a great time it looks

like they might be some sort of

wilderness Patrol that just got back

recently because you can see their boots

or they still got snow melted snow

around them and their cloaks they'll

have bits of snow on and whatnot

but you can see a figure in the shadows

drinking with them but clearly not of

their band it's possible they joined him

or he joined them at some point and he's

striking because he's not a dwarf he's a

human and he's this kind of dashing

young figure with a wide brimmed hat

with a feather in it and a fancy cloak

kind of thrown over to one on and he's

drinking with the dwarves having a good

time but he is watching you and palton

closely that much you can tell nobody

else is really but he is is he hot yes

[Laughter]

sounds like it I look at him and it's

clear he probably thinks he is look at

paltin and I look at him look at Pelton

when I tried it on Terra's still messed

up for where he had the Raven head on

like straw colored hair sticking out in

various places and he's wearing that I'm

trying to determine whether the guy is

staring at me because I'm a gold

construct or whether he's staring at

paltin okay make an insight check uh

[Applause]

eleven uh you're not sure do I so I only

sense that she's like like perceiving

something or do I actually sense that

she's momentarily distracted by

something you're not drunk enough yet to

turn around so just like so so uh it's

like it's like noises right right cuz

every time I turn my head at the pub

yeah I think luckily so I'm gonna go out

on a limb and think something's up yeah

uh you can see that a dwarven one of the

Dwarven bar keepers here has gone over

to that table now and is filling up

giving new mugs of ale but also that the

man is talking to that barkeep

it looks like he's ordering something

but while he's ordering he's not really

he's paying he's still paying close

attention to both to you one of you both

of you you're not sure have I seen this

yet yes you have picked up on it now I'm

just going to look over and be like

they're a problem a gulp of orbs kind of

all turn and look at paulten as he

shouts across the bar some of the

conversations stop some of them don't

there's still some laughter in various

corners that has unrelated to any of

this

the dwarves who are gathered around this

human they don't initially pay mine but

it's clear that the human has picked up

on the tone and sort of shoe he sends

the party this way and he just sort of

looks up at you tips his hats

gentlemanly and says no everything's

fine here go back to your Drake folks

and he says just with some friends of

mine and turns his eyes back to the

dwarves could I like cauldron it's fine

he's probably just staring at you cuz

you're so pretty can I like inside check

to see if I even believed that yep go

ahead that would be a 12 the this the

hint of a smile on his face suggests

that he it has a insincerity to it I'm

gonna walk over to him I'm gonna like

grab a chair on the way you sort of you

get up you start to drag a chair across

the floor over toward the sky evenly

what you do when paltin leaves his drink

and takes the chair I like immediately

jump up and again my dexterity is still

kind of on filter so kind of like good

what yeah when you do the hand jumps

onto your shoulder evylyn

I I kind of I'm like alright and I like

rollin rollin with my my new hand homie

alright

it wasn't fast enough to jump on

Paulding shoulder but it manages to get

on yours ah Strix and DF you have felled

the bug bears and DF you have the sword

with the key lock in it I whisper to the

hand he really likes chairs these days

[Laughter]

yeah uh deaath you should open the sword

I don't know if you could open a sword

but maybe it'll give us some answers I

don't know by the way I'm just gonna

start yelling serous come on sandy I

really found the person yet but it's

getting late

Suns going down you don't see hide nor

hair of the the DAO but you can if you

want to go into the darkness to try to

find him you can oh I don't want to go

in the darkness anywhere but I'll just

tell D it like D if we have to go find

kaha right cuz I have to put her back in

the thing so he doesn't come and kill us

at night or something also did you

should open the sword and I'm sorry I

hit you I accept your apology so you're

gonna go after kaha rock or you gonna do

something else alright umm yeah so

strict says she's going after Kharak umm

death won't follow her okay in the

meantime he's just got bit like

basically like the news thought he's

received he's kind of scoping out the

whole time kind of like looking it up

and down and just kind of more mystified

and confused and yeah it's a beautifully

crafted sword and as you sort of keep it

you can see that it wants to be attuned

to it like you know it wants that sort

of connection and and the the Fox head

is obviously emblematic of something but

you don't know what the red gem is just

a dark red gem set into its mouth and

then the blade itself has the name of

the weapon in it in abyssal it's light

and it feels like a good fit for your

hand

it looks like a human whoa okay

that's not something weird that was made

by like a tiefling or something yeah

as you follow Couric you don't see hide

nor hair of him but you do see what

appears to be an open secret door in the

in one wall of the hall it's only open

about a foot or so enough for maybe a

dwarf to squeeze through Kihara

to get through that door would have had

to have altered his form in some way as

it's only about five feet high have we

been through this whole way before yes

dammit I didn't answer a secret door

usually straight as Deus says that Strix

is like maybes because you're depressed

knows you're as you're sort of glancing

at the door you can see without closing

it that were you to close it you think

the Dwarven stone craft would be quite

incredible good war with the door would

be very well-hidden so it's clear that

card can go this way

but someone definitely did and recently

well he could have if he was sand yeah

technically yeah that's yeah you've seen

Clark assume almost almost like a sandy

gaseous flying gaseous and form we can

check I can hear when you go first

a check for traps behind the door you

can see a long tunnel leading off into

darkness and there are cobwebs and dust

aplenty in here but you also see what

appear to be footprints indicating the

passage of a dwarf any sort of

indication of the passage of a weird

sand snake no huh all right you want to

go this way I I don't see any other way

we should yes okay okay so I'll uh

guess I'll take the lead and then the

using his dungeon delving feet feet

beyond the console look out for trap

says in other potential secret doors as

they approach okay okay you've got the

drift globe to light the way so make it

up section check for me DF okay mmm 23

Oh

the passage begins you the passage comes

to what appears to be a labyrinth of

passageways heading off various

directions and it is really the dust and

the cobwebs that suggests where the

dwarf went to and as you follow these

footsteps through this labyrinth you can

see at various points it opens up onto

catwalks overlooking machinery big stone

gears and other things like you're kind

of in the inner workings of Citadel at

bars defenses cool and you can hear most

of them are still but in the distance

you can have your low clunks and thumps

of some mechanisms that are in motion

and controlling things that you can only

imagine and as you follow the footsteps

they lead you deeper and deeper and

deeper up down sideways back forth

through Citadel ad bar and let's see if

you're moving at 30 feet you do see at

one point a branching passageway that

leads off into a lit area and it looks

like the footprints go in that direction

and you can see it spill out onto a

Ledge overlooking the market oh okay I

mean and it's like a 20 foot drop down

to the market floor so they made it to

the market Oh we'll never find them all

right where are you Herick I'm just

gonna yell come back if the market is

currently but bustling and like a lot of

people or yeah okay as far as you know

Strix coming back wasn't in your orders

oh uh he gotcha tricksters lies on the

ground and start screaming I've had a

bad day uh

at that point in time the sword becomes

attuned to UDF Oh No

and the red gem lights up ah hell Glynda

they kind of like hold it out like it's

like blade down so like that yeah when

you hold it out it says hello DF ah in

common yes all right

hello it's so good to be with you who

are you

I'm gutter what are you I'm a magic

short sort of backstabbing where did you

come from if you'd like to know more

about my origins I suggest you use the

key

what Joette you do have the key I've

always had it the death will get his

ring of keys out okay

and he's use one before yes so it's

gonna like flip through that one mm-hmm

come look at the keyhole look at the

others okay uh and pause for a little

bit even actually glances over at strips

what's the face of Kai even says like

that's a good idea

should I said drinks isn't looking she's

still on the ground screaming just like

I'm so stupid oh I don't know magic at

all oh it's not clear that she can even

hear the swords voice death there

doesn't seem to recognition on her part

okay

yes oh so with that deal almost like

turn his back to him okay that term is

back towards tricks and then whatever

one he believes the proper key amendment

insert it and twist to unlock whatever

it is all right when you do that uh a UH

gateway Oh opens up in front of you just

tears opening oops

a super-strict sees Matthew she's just

like wow she's rolling her office and

strix you can tell immediately that a

gate key has been used to open a planer

gate yeah

tricks this trip to try to explain that

to Dee it but she's not really speaking

normally so she's like right and

stepping through the gate into view is a

robed creature about 6 feet tall maybe a

little bit more than six feet tall with

the robe is that it's wearing is quite

immaculate red with black thread and it

is being worn by a creature that looks

like a bipedal humanoid fox oh and oh

great with a fox tail Oh : and

spectacles a small pair of spectacles

perched on its nose and this fox like

creature has long fangs and a wreath of

vines worn about its head and some of

those vines sort of trailed down from

the wreath down her back and seemed to

move of their own accord and you can see

these vines are unusual because they've

got all these razor like spines oh oh I

know that real well mm-hmm you can have

more closely that her robes have arcane

sigils woven into them and even you can

see her long kind of talent Fox like

fingers are all sort of well

manicured and sort of perfectly um

painted and this figure stands before

you and says I see the sword has found a

new owner and you are who strikes is

gonna throw herself in front of dia to

be like daughter but you kind of trips

and falls like in front of the F and the

creature like kind of getting tangled

hopefully in some of the the razor vine

but and she's just like that Oh God

at that point in time the the creature

is distracted by Strix is it actually

kind of turns away from UDF and kneels

down next to Strix and kind of like

Strix kind of tries to grab you to pick

you up go and she says I know you what

no you don't you don't know me

we've met before what now was we maybe

it's been a long time though I don't

remember she's just like looking at the

ground if you are step away from her if

you were in the hive maybe you kicked me

or something I don't know you were in

the hive for a while I knew you looked

familiar

I also made donuts for a while yeah

you're being completely ignored by this

yeah mmm but why aren't why are you at

my friends sword my friends call me

shemesh gah

at that point she stands this jerks

remember running into this creature at

all Strix uh make a history check Julio

to see if I was to panic to know what

was happening or not ah

fifteen when you were a child and in the

care of your grandma grandma no right um

you had a brief but scintillating

encounter briefly with one of grandmas

associates and this creature seems to

fit the bill you do have a childhood

memory you think that she may have tried

to buy you

oh I'll recall that and then scramble up

and just be like bad news since bad news

mean mean magic magic person bad

they tried I'll tell I'll tell D at that

and you know that this creature is

called a narcan all off it is a type of

fiend well-versed in magic I also know

that they could probably kill us in like

one blank oh you know that our Connell

offs are among the most powerful fiends

in the multiverse right just peed myself

a little

all right so deaath clearly senses

tricks is utter terror shamash go will

say you have summoned me I will answer

three questions that you have no more

than three and return to my plane and I

will take that key with me if you wish

to summon me again use another one of

your keys uh look a local red string

fiends questions is bad you don't really

want those answers that's my opinion by

nice on here okay um dere's a look back

at their kana left off back down the

sword as well back up at Chumash chica

yep

where are Pelton and evylyn she says I

don't know who they are I'm not a God

and I'm not a psychic

oh Jesus he says I am a researcher if it

can be learned than I know it

oh okay

since I didn't explain I won't count

that one thank you oh so nice hahaha

do we have anything that needs a dig and

you you uh strikes you know when she

says that that Arcana laughs they hoard

lore from across the multiverse so they

are extremely learned alright I'll try

and explain that to DIA can just say if

you need to know something something

anything baby perhaps you'd like to ask

me who made that sword that'd be a good

question yeah I just I have so many I'm

trying to I have someone I want to ask

but my time is precious dear oh we know

I remember when you tried to buy me he

made it research things did tell me

everything you know about this or she

turns back to Strix now now I know you I

remember you you were quite the darling

thing back then weren't you strikes

you're just gonna say what's your like

I'm sorry I wish person who did uh I

just said tell me everything about this

sword that's not a question

will you tell me everything about this

sword no no no asking dad okay uh uh uh

do catch up there

ah just give me a second I just fit sir

so much okay who made this sword

I did and for what purpose

she says as a gift to an adventurer one

of your descendants I believe you do

bear a resemblance to her her and so

it's been around for a while I believe

her name was

Gareth that's two questions

what's your third strikes the Strix is

gonna poke at me like I asked about ask

about the the reason we were dying oh

okay uh sure yeah Strix and I were under

of curse of death but Reese suffered the

same symptoms we're slowly dying but

things that have killed us before what

was causing that that sounds familiar

hmm have you made enemies of the undead

a lich perhaps there's a vampire lord

count maybe we would lunch she says

which one uh cuz they boast rod fawns

are Oh oh I've heard of hidden

don't get so excited cuz it was a bad

time for us she says this type of thing

is exactly what might happen if an evil

godling we're somehow present in the

world and sucking life in order to

rejuvenate itself perhaps your enemy has

one of those that sounds bad feeding on

the life forces of the mortal puny yes I

don't think we're ready to fight a God's

Ling

she says what world is this this would

be torille and she sort of goes through

her mental catalogue and says I suggest

that you learn everything you can about

a CEREC he's here the key if you please

fix it you're just gonna try and

pronounce it she's like yes sir

Astrid ciserek deaath will take one of

his Kings like removed from the ring and

give it to her she takes it in her hand

and leaps back through the portal and it

closes up behind her so you are down one

key okay Astrid yes ass-crack all right

meanwhile paulten you Jack the chair

over across the tavern toward this guy

hmm who is sort of kicked back in a pose

that suggests he could see you're coming

this way and he's trying to get a read

on what you're up to but he's not moving

or flinching his dwarves are too busy

drinking to care mm-hmm what do you do

I'm just gonna plop the chair next to

him I'm just gonna sit down I'm just

gonna lean him like ask you a question

I didn't like your answer so is there a

problem no no and he says I'm just

another visitor here like you and

your reputation precedes you you're the

one they call paltin no and he hoped

that he Altera

a hand to shake it and he says Vorbis

for pasq Renner I'm gonna have my

animated hand shake his hand in my stead

alright that sort of leaps off of evil

and shoulder onto the table and extends

itself out toward him

the dwarves all freaked out when it

lands and they start to try to dash it

with their mugs and it sort of hops

around the table while they're flailing

at this thing that's landed in the midst

like a big dead bug and then Vorbis just

tries to calm them and the dwarves

settle down and they're all just freaked

out

that's all waters had oh my god is this

ever ever don't let it touch you it

looks like some horrible curse upon you

can I uh

suddenly the bar sort of clear the table

clears away it's just you and for

purpose in the hand oh that works for

pasol kind of shake the hand hmm and he

kind of holds up the hand while he's

shaking it he's like looking at it he

says wait sleep and when you're up to it

you're up at this point so for a minute

there I thought you were gonna swing the

chair and try to hit me over the head

with it

well what would give you that idea

oh I don't know just the way you were

storming toward me couldn't get a read

on that and your penchant for chairs a

plate comes out to the man delivered by

the barkeep and it's a plate of waffles

cut I know I just wish my finger

flops a container of syrup nearby and

pours syrup over the waffles it'll tear

rolls down evens chief no it doesn't

oh geez Perkins

[Laughter]

um guy just like I'd be like uh and just

like grab a waffle yeah okay he'll he'll

ask the barkeep to bring over somewhere

he'll just push his plate over to you so

you can have the plate he'll get another

plate from the barkeep and take one of

the waffles off and eat it slice it up

and you just start jumping on it

porcelain you can't smell the waffles

I'm just having a little existential

crisis how much like my soul wants to

eat the waffles but nothing else in me

has the ability or desire T waffles very

bothered by this

I uh I take a bite of it I'm just like

knows I always thought these were a

little overrated huh hmm so anyway you

say I have a reputation here among the

dwarves assited a lab I are quite the

celebrity egg look around like he says

Oh everyone here loves you you're quite

famous some of the dwarfs say they're

making medals for you heroism in the

face of giant adversity well did do a

pretty fantastic job I think paltin make

a constitution saving throw what okay

no just having a nice laughing there's

something funny about the waffles no I

know uh that would be a twenty-one okay

just like spit it out yeah yeah you can

you can check out his face that seems to

surprise Vorbis and he kind of says are

something wrong today

probably I just like throw it and push

the plate back at him okay how would you

do he sort of kind of stand kind of

backs off and surprised because he

wasn't expecting this I you see he's

genuinely surprised by your reaction he

says I and he's been eating them says

they taste all right to me you don't

like them I can get you something else

they have a lot here um I'm good I'm

good fam even make a perception check

whoo um 20 you can see that this is sort

of a darkened place but there is a heart

that's fires and there are lanterns set

about to kind of like the dim corners

and whatnot

you can see the shadows playing about

you are struck or reminded rather for

the first time that palton shadow isn't

there you see Vorbis in his shadow you

see other dwarf shadows around you see

an empty chair shadowed on the wall

which paltin is sitting in but no shadow

of paltin there is this is something

that you've been aware of ever since you

left

yeah or Rovia but you're struck by it

too this time and Vorbis says look I'm

but a friend here and I don't wish to

make any trouble I'm sorry you don't

like their waffles quite popular that

guy had a shadow yes he says if you need

a friend I'd like to be thought of that

for pasq Renner I'll be around for a few

days not to be rude or anything but why

would you want to be friends with us

other than that pollens famous

he says I represent some interests in

this realm and well we're always on the

lookout for those of noble heart and

spirit who might see it upon themselves

to help those in need were the good guys

and he'll pull out of his glove a coin

and just sort of slide it across the

table toward you evylyn and you can see

it is a silver piece with what looks

like a face like you find out many coins

the head of somebody on it I look at it

and I look at him and I'm like what do I

look like to you what what are you

trying to pay for yes he says I'm paying

for the dinner please

stay have a good time I'll see you again

soon and he gets up gets you know gets

straightens out his cloak and prepares

to leave doesn't my divine sense pick up

anything about him ah you don't sense

any strong evil but you are sensing the

presence of evil in the area not from

him and I don't get a second you get a

sense of good from him and and I do I

get a sense of where this evil is

emanating from it all

palton what or his general vicinity I

start kind of like like sniffing around

him like I'm kind of just like do I take

notice of this

oh she's acting weird again I completely

ignore purpose when he says he's leaving

I'm like that okay and I just focused on

pompton and examining him very carefully

all right as the two of you as you

notice that evil uns looking at you

weird and evil and you notice that

there's something going on in the

vicinity of paulten that's evil you

start to hear the noise in the hall

become more deadened and deadened and

the outer edges of the tavern become

lost in

darkness light seems to copy into

coalesce around you the dim Lantern

light

it's like parts of the tavern are fading

away into blackness I I grab paltin and

Hollen to his feet and hand in the chair

and then stand back to back with him

protectively okay as soon as you pull

paltin from the chair halten when you

stand up you see Evelyn is beside you

but you're not in the tavern anymore you

appear to have stood up out of a large

wooden throne what's going on can you

see though the wood of the throne has

sort of velvet cushions kind of set into

its high back and into its arms and into

its seat and you can see a prominent

motif that looks like a symbol of the

Sun carved into the the top of the

throne all around you you see a cobweb

dust strewn throne Hall in one corner of

which is a large round window with no

glass I see this - yes you're there you

take in dusty air around you you are in

what appears to be a castle throne room

and then you hear a a rumble of thunder

in the distance I I'm guessing I

recognize this room ah yes this appears

to be counts trod Vaughn's arrow your

own home

and you hear outside of us large set of

double doors a sort of kalaam kalaam

clop clop clop clop clop of footsteps

approaching and then you here at ching

ching ching ching with a sort of

somebody jangling the locks and the door

handles big giant tall double doors to

this throne hall began to creak open um

can i like quickly cast invisibility on

evylyn yes okay I'm doing that

evylyn turns invisible and moments later

the vampire uh sure do I know I'm

invisible right yes so and he vows my

lord
