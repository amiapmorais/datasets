[Music]

hey everybody and welcome to dice camera

action

[Applause]

so last week to jump right in the waffle

crew had a Throwdown with the ancient

red dragon Klaus and the dragon had its

heart set on obtaining the ring of

winter which is currently on the finger

of one paltin SEPA bard extraordinaire

who is unknown to his friends under the

rings control and not willing to part

with it the dragon warded by various

attacks and attempts to distract it

knocked a wall down on top of the waffle

crew burying almost everybody and some

some of the party members are still

buried under said wall one person who is

not buried under there is the waffle

crews newest companion a two vacci

hunter named bag of nails who

discovering that he was kept getting

thrown off the dragon and knocked about

grabbed on to a rope ladder and is

climbing up to this thing flying

overhead the acquisitions incorporated

airship which has already loved one

harpoon at the dragon and missing

horribly paltin

is was buried under the rubble but is no

longer buried he was pulled up to his

feet by DF if I remember correctly so DF

tried to purloin the ring off of paltin

but paltin was having none of it

grabbing on to paul Tain's other hand is

Simon his trusty puppet companion and

Strix is nearby and I believe Strix that

you are currently in gaseous form

correct I am currently in gaseous form

yes okay and Ana who has lost her voice

for a number of days now but has just

started

to regain it evylyn I believe is still

fluttering around near her party now in

front of said dragon

what does that say laughs and her blah

blah okay and when last we left the

party it was Strix astern now Strix

before you act the dragon using a free

action is staring down paltin and paltin

as it talks you can feel just heat

washing over you and the air ripples

around you from that heat as it as it

breathes and it says to you the ring is

raw elemental power like me we have much

to learn from each other

do the wise thing give it to me now or

I'll incinerate your friends also

remember that Strix cast death Ward

spells on evylyn palton and DF so should

you ever get dropped down to zero hit

points you will drop to one instead and

as this happens as the dragon bellows

this at paltin Strix what do you if

anything want to do well so he's pinning

Paulson down right he basically is not

at the moment

uhm paltin was buried by the wall then

the dragon came over on top of the wall

cleared the rubble off of paltin so that

he could have more words with him and

then DF pulled Walt

paltin up to his feet so Paul Kane is

standing nose to nose with this jumbo

jet sized red scaled reptile

uh is there any way that I could like

materialize in front of everyone

yeah you couldn't dirty yourself into

the conversation in that way yes is

there any way I could insert myself yeah

okay you want to just sort of gaseous

cloud make your way over there and kind

of form up in front of the dragon or do

you want to like misty step in gaseous

form in front of the dragon or what yeah

I would yeah I would like to do that

like really like really fast like I'm

just gonna stand there for a second look

at me go look I know that you're a big

bad blood dragon like you and we're

don't worry about the ring I'm just

telling you not to kill us right now cut

her because I'm gonna tell you that

we're trying to save everyone right and

and there's treasure there's treasure

under here we're trying to stop the soul

monger which is a thing that's

collecting Souls which means that people

can't be resurrected anymore which means

that no one can make magical items

anymore which means that you can't get

treasure anymore so if we don't stop

them please don't kill us if we don't

stop it then you won't get any more

treasure I that's the dark chant and I

promise you this is the truth you can

smell it you can smell where the tomb is

and GPS or cell phone Cassius be all

right okay go ahead and make a

persuasion check can even eight or

persuasion by nodding heartily 26 okay

it says

I will give that some thought after the

ring is given to me that's fine give me

the ring or she looks back and Paula's

like handed to me yes and at that moment

this strix make a perception check okay

okay you see and detect nothing else and

you don't know where as far as you know

dragon bait and waffles are still buried

under the stone of the collapsed wall

you don't know where they are it would

be their turn now but you don't hear or

see anything paltin what do you do when

Strix says this and the dragon response

oh that's that's that's the question of

the day isn't it yeah a lot of people

tuning in this evening to find out what

the answer this question is okay

including me so I am under the Rings

control then the ring has instructed me

not to give it to the dragon correct and

the reason and the reason you sense that

the ring doesn't want to is because it

it believes that the Dragons will might

be stronger than its and it does not

want to be controlled by a creature of

that mighty okay now does that prevent

me from taking the ring off in general

no as long as you can keep it out of the

Dragons hands okay so I'm going to if I

may I'm going to look at the dragon I'm

going to say alright you'll want it I'm

gonna take the ring off okay now just it

just taking it off and putting it on a

different hand count as a is that a free

action or yeah okay so I'm gonna say you

want it and I'm going to put it on the

hand of hell

okay your severed hand yeah I'm going to

open a dimension door okay and I'm gonna

throw the hand through it okay all right

as soon as the hand flies to dimension

door and then the dimension door just

collapses the dragon just goes like this

like I can't believe what you have just

done I'm looking back am just like

better go get it

and okay bag of nails oh

paltin do you want to do anything out

you gotta stand your ground you're gonna

move you're gonna just basically stay

where you are

because you all you've done basically is

taking action to cast the spell and

throw the hand through I'm terrified all

right bag of nails when last we left you

you had jumped up onto the rope ladder

right man hadn't climbed up yet

and you're not sure what just sort of

went on back there you can just see the

big posterior of the dragon and hear it

talking to the party at that point in

time BAM you slam into the wall of a

ruined building as the ladder basically

just takes you up against it and then

from above hanging from the rigging a

gnome says watch out yes yes it's you

sort of get the air pop knocked out of

you for a second but yes you do hold

onto the ladder okay at the end of your

action you are on the deck of the ship

so if I look around in a real quick

perception check yeah I mean these are

these dudes legit or are they sort of

imbeciles everything that well make a

actually make a wisdom in sight

yeah and if you don't have insight it's

just your wisdom bonus 13 okay you think

that they're imbeciles and there are

only three there are only three of them

there is a female elf on the wheel which

if you look at the deck of the ship here

it's sort of between the harpoon gun and

the fire furnace that provides the flame

sure yeah and then there is a gnome

hanging to the rigging on the side of

the ship very close to you right now and

then there's the tiefling who's standing

behind the harpoon gun which is now

loaded but oh it's they just finished

loading the second harpoon in it last

week and you said last week that you

wanted to be the one the fire it yeah

all right so the tea fling is just tells

you it's ready to go party blow me as a

chance to maybe escape this doomed fate

so I'm gonna take the action I was

hoping to take okay okay harpoon right

in this beast okay I would like you to

make a perception check okay we roll the

three plus seven okay a 10 is just high

enough to tell that even though the

tiefling told you that it's locked

loaded and ready to fire

that there is a locking latch that's in

place that prevents it from turning that

you can basically remove or lift that

latch with your foot how do you fail at

a check if you had tried to turn the

harpoon gun you wouldn't have been able

to I think that may have been a better

call directly to my own okay okay make a

d20 roll and I roll

so the the harpoon gun has a bonus to

hit plus six which you can add to the

role okay and do I get any my that's

actually true I will let you use your

longbow attack bonus which is plus 12

oh that's plus 18 I'm gonna hit no it

would just be plus 12 you would use that

instead of the harpoon this is a good

way that I think I start going through

this my history of my life and I start

immediately playing that last fret

weighing is I'm about to die okay do you

say any of that out loud errs at all

just in your head uh-huh can you see it

wait wait there is that that Wow all

right I would like you to roll 12 or

d-10 yeah we're all 12 d-10 for the

damage yes you do double damage on a

crit pull my gun all right take nine

nine one six how many is that that's

sick that's three nine okay

that's four eight it's five six my god

three

hang on seven okay

you have two forty-nine damage right now

seven seven or 56 excellent

so that's been let's see four eight nine

that's ten roles you have two more zero

that's ten and at one all right you do

75 points of damage with that so as as

the hand disappears through the door and

the dragon sort of rears his head up and

starts sniffing around his nostrils

flaring as he tries to basically catch

the scent of where the ring and the hand

have gone a huge harpoon shoots and

sticks right in the back of his skull

all right I jump on the fright and as

you do that you notice that the tiefling

staying next you just backs away from

you

all right the dragon lets out a

deafening roar so loud that every

creature in Omo and the nearby jungle

can probably hear it and that's a bag of

nails turn the acquisition ink balloon

crew they're sort of stunned for a

moment and they don't know what to do

next do you want to say anything to the

bag of nails and you totally caught up

in your fuse all say the elf the elf

behind the wheel says come again the

gnome says he's crazy

he's insane we can't do that he's not

our captain who's our captain

and the the tiefling says I'll be

captain okay all right I'll make a make

an intimidation check for me on the

slide that would just be a charisma

check for you see here plus two 12 14

okay they're actually pretty feeble so

they're kind of intimidated by that he's

just gonna ruin the chief Ling sort of

braces himself against the railing he

says well I always knew I was gonna die

this way and the ant weed is like I I

captain and looks at the elf she seems

to be of the three probably the most

sensible but as she looks past bag of

nails toward the bowsprit that nice

sharp protrusion on the front of the

vessel and not wanting to catch the the

cat man's wrath you see her move the

wheel and make some lever adjustments

that seems to take the ship on a

downward trajectory I and there has the

party here's dive all right this is

funny Klaus goes next oh so did you just

sort of throw the hand in a random

direction as far out as you possibly

could yeah it unfortunately needs to be

within 120 feet because I still want to

have my link to the hand so but did is

there anyway like I don't know retro

actively I could

perceive like what a good like hiding

place or somewhere that looked like it's

like okay he has a good shot there yeah

absolutely and there's lots of tumbled

down ruins around so they had to be

scuttling underneath a bunch of that for

cover and basically staying out of line

of sight oh boy

Klaus almost like a gigantic 6,000 tonne

kitty cat turns and goes bounding off in

a direction in that direction ring yeah

he really really wants that ring and as

he turns his tail just sort of flashes

over you all and and sort of follows him

out off the ruin in that direction now

on the ground he can move 40 feet as

movement so he's going to basically

double move in the direction of the hand

alright and he will oh wait no that's no

no he is going to start moving in that

direction and then he is going to look

up at the airship coming coming in

toward him

using his advanced situational awareness

and then the ones that are in his wing

tip talons point up and fire together so

the first thing that happens is a

fireball streaks from one of the wands

up toward the airship and detonates on

deck so bag of nails make a dexterity

saving throw crazy +5 so 23 okay that's

really good ah remember I took you did

and I I don't think Holly you put a

death Ward on bag of nails is that

correct to the best degree

he'd been he was waiting he was too far

away yep okay well fortunately the ones

saved DC is much lower than the Dragons

so you only need a 15 to succeed so

you're going to take half damage from

the fireball

yep evasion let's see if you do have

anything here I don't think so you're a

ranger okay I'm checking your spells but

I think you used up all your spell's all

right who knows kris patrol all ones all

right

the tiefling failed his save the gnome

failed his save those guys are dead and

the elf the elf succeeded on hers still

dead okay so um they the two who failed

go up in flames

Oh actually the T flings got fire

resistance so he's only gonna take half

he is still dead you have a body

afterwards yes so hidden air goes up in

flames

shouting expletives as he dies the gnome

against or blasted off the ship and the

rest of the party can see this little

flaming body falling off the ship and

just sort of down into the set you will

end up taking 11 points of damage from

that bag of nails all right so and then

the second one goes off simultaneously

and it is a stroke of lightning that

targets the

not you but the harpoon gun but you are

close enough to the metal harpoon gun to

be electrocuted so I would like you to

make another dexterity saving throw I

[Applause]

rolled a 13 okay all right so you're

going to take half damage which is half

half of just the residual damage you're

going to take three points of lightning

damage your harpoon gun as its hit by

the lightning you just see its casing

kind of crack open and it explodes into

a million shards okay definitely hum

about it alright and that's the end of

Klauss turn evil is a character who

wants to die you certainly lived a long

time alright and as the rest of you can

see the airship is tilting down its huge

long bowsprit aiming down toward the

dragon and there's smoke and fire coming

off of it as it descends with the

screaming cat at the front and then

evylyn you are up you see the dragon go

off after what you assumed to be palton

severed hand evylyn was always already

in the process of like making sure

everyone was okay after the wall

collapse and so she had one by one like

accounted for everybody except for

waffles so she's like she crabs strix

his arms like fight waffles and she

starts digging any bait oh yeah okay I

would like you to make a perception

check to make sure see if you are

digging in the right place

the Raiders of the Lost Ark line but

that's all yes that's why I asked tricks

cuz she has such good perception yeah

can she so I would give you advantage on

the check if you could smell Dragonborn

but you can't smell anything you got

smell but but gaseous tricks you can

also make a perception check I'm solid

now oh okay

solid tricks 21 okay you think that you

can hear waffles underneath the rubble

and coming from the same general place

and both dragon bait and waffles are

very close together when they were

buried you can also hear or I should say

smell a strong scent of ham alright I'm

like I'm like a all point to where

waffles is and send evil in cuz she's

stronger yeah like waffles that way and

I'm like ham this way

she's nice are they pointing in the same

place make it evil and just make a

strength athletics check for me to

determine how how you how well you dig

through this 21 okay yeah you start to

just throw huge chunks of stone left

right everywhere else and as you remove

a one stone you see dragon baits arm

still holding his sword that had been

sort of pinned down under the stone is

sort of free and starts to sort of move

around and you're and you clear out

enough now that you can actually kind of

make out the the growls of the waffles

coming up at based on and this looks

really cool cuz he flings really strong

so yeah I was like having these huge

beasts

yes throwing rocks hither and thither

alright Strix and EF make another

perception check for me okay I got it -

don't worry I got this

23 that's good all right

DF you can see closing in around the

wreckage of the wall sort of closing in

around your position or what appeared to

be dozens of serpents obviously drawn

here not only by the collapsed wall but

by the Dragons loud bellow and it is

your turn maybe scared away by the

Dragons bellow

they're hoping they can slip under the

radar well they did goddamn snakes do

not have a priority straight yeah but

you are up TF all right how close were

these snakes to us they are about 30

feet away and closing making their way

across the ground it's like just like a

huge group yeah there you can see

basically like a half dozen coming from

this side and then like another half

dozen coming from another angle are they

coming in and there - connection that's

gonna like impede our progress to the

end of this labyrinth some of them are

yes there there are three between you in

the direction you want to go and they

are and then the others are kind of like

coming out of broken walls or underneath

other areas and but they're they're all

sort of converging on your location all

right

okay I'll tell evil and just to just to

keep getting them out of there and then

GFO colic start hopping down the rocks

and kind of running his way towards

where we're trying to get to this entire

friggin time and then uh so it seems

like their seasons right there's three

directly peeing us and like the other

nine or kind of elsewhere yeah yeah okay

I take a small horn out of one of my

belt pouches okay and then do I think I

could get the larger group all of them

like a close by I think I can I get on

within the horns you you think with the

size of the horns blast you can get

about six of them in there okay yeah I'm

gonna do that just to hold them off or

at least spoon alright so yeah I'm gonna

take out I have this little horn yeah

and then just like kinda close my eyes

and just when you when you do that it

emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot

cone audible up to 600 feet away and

they have to make some constitutions

intros so Chris I forgot my aura of

vitality okay so you can heal someone

yeah okay desert somebody you want to

take care of what that strix was kind of

the worst for where wasn't she yeah okay

yeah I definitely heel strikes so you

get five Holly sorry

and also DF I need you to roll

percentile dice for me or if you prefer

just roll a d-10 we go percentile okay

because I know what this means

yeah and I'm real scared there's always

a chance the horn may explode Oh

ninety-four okay it does not explode

yeah all right roll v d6 Thunder damage

okay as you blast these snakes and they

go flying back

5d6

5d6 right here come the ones baby

there's one right 23 total oh wow okay

yes

suck at snakes did the rest of us be

caught in that urn no I moved away yeah

he aimed it away from you so the cone

did not catch any of you alright two of

them look like they took a pile of

damage and three of them look like they

took half damage and then this is it

back away or definitely they're deafened

okay yeah so they're deafening

so then they see death go that's right

Strix what do you do that airship is

getting closer closer to the dragon

actually because the dragon has moved

the airship is actually going into just

like you guys it's coming towards tricks

and Politan and evylyn right now I'm not

strong you can lift anything you didn't

lift 10 pound pebbles with your man's

mage hand let's see can I sense where

waffles is mm-hmm

could I can I try and and polymorph urn

to like a tiny lizard I think you have

to be able to see her okay

holy come on you can't get all right

well I'm just I'm just gonna help evil

and dig I'm not gonna leave them okay

make a strength athletics check

[Laughter]

excellent you're able to actually lift

stuff out and you're like mother

adrenaline yeah

that evil and that's exactly how you

read it you can't believe that Strix is

moving some of these big stones up by

herself but she is and yeah no end to

the surprises and as you sort of look

over your shoulder you see this burning

ship coming down upon me alright yes yes

yes

alright the you aunty the ones that you

blast DF yeah two of them sort of slip

away through walls and disappear from

sight the other three turn into their

normal selves now two of them look like

snake headed women and they've got bows

and they've got scimitars the third one

more human than that he looks like just

a man he is not wearing armor he's

wearing basically just a loincloth and

but his scales are jet-black and have

almost like an iron like quality to them

like his skin itself is a malleable suit

of armor that encases him and you can

see these sort of yellow slit eyes under

his his dark scaly brow and he he looks

like a human but a different kind of you

want a a more human type of you want a

not one did I've encountered before you

have never it in count never encountered

quite anything like this before

and to do transforming was basically

their action so they can't do anything

else these three we're now confronting

you and they're about 20 feet away from

you

the other thing you notice about the one

with the black scales is that he has got

he is wearing this sort of golden collar

that looks like some sort of either

religious or ceremonial

Neal piece of jewelry it looks quite old

it's got gems embedded in it and it

looks like an ancient piece of

ceremonial jewelry probably given to him

by somebody important take it that's

pretty afraid you're like all right as

the dragon lumbers toward where it

believes the hand has gone more of those

little vegetable people leap out of

bushes and accost the dragon with spears

and just sort of stabbing and then you

see three or four creatures that made

out of the same vegetable like matter

but instead of being little tiny people

with little veggie top knots there they

look like dogs

and they basically lunge onto the

Dragons flanks and back and start to try

to tear through its scales with their

teeth

maybe yeah all right it doesn't they

don't seem to be having a tremendous not

affect other than annoying the dragon I

get annoyed yeah that's fine

they're territorial yes and then palton

you see the dragon lumber off in the

direction you discarded the hand what do

you do okay

evylyn and Strix are busy digging

waffles out nearby so like after the

hands gone through and dragon starts

right away I'm like huh

and you're about to be impaled on the

bowsprit of a gigantic airship I did not

think this far ahead

where's ya you look over your shoulder

and you see death has run down the pile

of stone he blasted his horn which you

heard clear as day and is facing off

against three you want tea all of whom

seems to have taken damage from that

Horn of his gonna call out to it really

quick like yes you're smart any ideas I

didn't think we'd get this far either

get them out or clear the way

get them out clear the way okay how okay

so this ship is heading straight toward

us yeah does it how light do I have like

a rough guesstimate of how long like is

it like about to hit or is it like oh

that's coming we should probably do

something at the rate its descending it

could hit you momentarily the wild-card

is the lit aback see on the deck we

don't know what he's going to do if

anything as the ship is going down and

he's going down with it

this nose diving for you who is okay so

whose clues like pretty close to me

Strix and evylyn it help and how far are

they they're like 10 feet away and all

that Simon is right next to you

okay so right now it feels like the

priority is oh god there's a ship that's

gonna crash into us together

yeah it's about six seconds away from

running you through okay

can I throw up a hut to try and protect

everyone nearby you can if you have the

spell yep yep okay that's what I'm gonna

do

hey walking like a magical dome of

energy encompasses paltin Simon evylyn

and Strix on top of this mound of

collapse trouble and it's like a very

strict like reaction like I see the ship

I'm just like it comes out all around

you now paltin you have the ability to

dim this thing so that it's sort of you

can't see I want to make it like as

clear as poke a so bag of nails as the

ship is irrevocably plunging toward the

ground and the city below you see this

dome of energy spring up around your new

companions which you assume a sort of

protective effect you don't know what

the ship of this size is going to do but

what would you like to do you are

right on

the bow as you said the the dragon has

sort of run off in a direction

okay so things going down no matter what

you're not sure yeah you might have a

better idea if you were like near the

wheel where the the wheel and the levers

are not really my specialty flying a

balloon boat but I'm gonna flip back

there okay I'm gonna try to save more or

less the ideas that I want to save this

instrument of battle so I can still

attack the crap okay pull it up and

whatever leave or he hit to go down I'm

alright you do see the blackened charred

corpse of the elven woman kind of still

clutching on to the wheel mm-hmm

when you get there so you just sort of

pry herb charred fingers off of the wood

and cast her aside and sort of crank

back on the lever now you do it given

your current options you think one you

could crash into your party - you could

try to veer this ship off and still

continue on its trajectory hits a dragon

or you can do as you said which is pull

the ship up it's pretty easy the lever

you crank it and the the nose starts to

angle upward instead of downward okay

correct can I do I mean do I feel like I

have the ability to fly as close as I am

to the ground it's a pretty good time to

flip off yeah how hard could it be right

they never live yeah alright so as you

pull the lever back and the nose comes

up paltin you realize that the ship is

no longer in any danger of colliding

with you or the party Emmett and it just

sort of becomes it passes over you you

see it's giant skids one of them just

sort of brushes up against the top of

the dome as it scraped by

you think it's pretty easy now it looks

that way because the wheel basically

controls the direction the lever tells

you it gives you lift or whatnot

you don't think it's that hard a problem

it can't be that hard these three morons

we're doing it okay then I'm gonna crank

this baby around and try to ram the

backside of that alright so the ship is

now directly above the rest of the party

turning on its horizontal axis in the

direction of the dragon and you hear

this I'll stick my face on the side and

I'll say sing of me in song they all

roll Nate roll a d20 for me this is for

the hand I just want to get I'm having

at make a stop so uh am I am I am i

adding anything it's - this - okay

yes but it won't make any difference I

mean this forty all right

mine it's small it's skittering so the

dragon just sort of pounces on it like a

cat with its two claws and shuffles to

itself it's mine it's mine

finally is it the hands turn uh nope

okay on clouds turn he doesn't do much

else except cackle at pinning down or

Heath you can't see

the hand is it's too small and too lost

in the rubble

you only get Klaus read on the situation

but it is at that point when a large

chunk of stone comes flying through the

air and tries to strike the dragon and

in fact does hit it right in the side of

its head

Oh since evylyn and Strix are digging

I'll let paltin and bag of nails make a

perception check to see if they see

where this rock came from

nice nice so 26 18 both of you see

through the ash and rubble approaching

the dragon r3 frost giants and the lead

one is a big towering 24 25-foot tall

female giant with a rusted helm with

great with this sort of white dragon fin

coming off the top of it and she's

clutching something that looks like a

big necklace around her neck and she

says and LAN and the other two beside

her both males equally humongous one of

them has a chunk of a route like looks

like the top of an obelisk that he's

preparing to throw and he just he's it

at the dragon's head hitting the dragon

again so both of they're both of their

hunks of stone just wallop the dragon

and it sort of stunned momentarily by

the strikes and one of the Giants shouts

to his companions da for Avant

don't need us people fun do any of you

speak giant oh man have we'd mentioned

that we had all a lot of unfinished

business if you will I mean welcome to

storm Kings Thunder yeah start looking

around for Straub coming - yeah right

the female giant shouts at the dragon

she just absolutely barks - the tougher

lungs dog or echo or some heist and the

dragon says you are too late I switch

she says you will not freeze the world

on my watch and then it is evil ends

turn oh my god evylyn look great you

want to make another strength check yeah

all right excellent

so who else wants this thing anyone can

he take it okay hello yeah it's up for

grabs sixteen you at you pull off enough

rubble now that dragon bait can

basically climb out and you can see that

he has sort of been bodily keeping a lot

of the rocks from falling on two waffles

and you see waffles head just sort of

poke up through a big hole and it just

sort of unflushed itself in front of the

other the best I kept trying be a huge

hug and like a kiss on the cheese all

right don't say anything to him because

he never says anything to me and no

one's ever mentioned that he

communicates good smell to me so I just

mute and I don't understand why I can't

understand but I just like sherry

communicates and then I go and I like

kiss waffles all over the face we keep

trying to figure out okay

yeah all right dear you are

you've got the three you aunty staring

you down

and all this is going on behind behind

me you hear giant voices behind you and

you aunty still look like they're not

like oh we better stop the ice

giants dragon or anything no great how

do you MIT well they seem plenty

distracted so is there a way I can give

this horn another two and hit as many

young T as possible

mm-hmm let's see yeah if you just use an

action and blue there it goes

yep I'm gonna go ahead and make another

excuse me

percent I'll check to see how the horn

first yeah right and I'll make the

saving throws for these guys pretty high

77 very good okay so the horn is fine

and roll your damage 5d6

get out of the way this time they they

know it's coming they kind of try to

brace themselves as best they can

however they all failed their save all

right um so they aren't they are all

deafened okay and do you want to move it

all are you gonna stand your ground keep

these guys from getting to your friends

what's the current situation of the rest

of my party so you see the waffle hut a

transparent dome scintillating on top of

the rubble pile you can see dragon bait

is now out of the rubble you can see him

perfectly clearly he's standing next to

evylyn she's hugging him and you can

hear the big ball of fur that is waffles

and see Strix pulling more stones away

from the albear to clear a path that she

can escape on her own okay

so and there's a gigantic ship that has

turned to face the dragon

and is beginning to move off in that

direction with all due haste great who's

actually inside the hood paltin evylyn

Strix dragon bait and waffles okay Wow

okay great so they're all protect us a

nice safe house there is actually

yeah but Halton pumpkin popped and I was

not inside which means I cannot enter

yeah sorry dude I'll probably still use

my movement to kind of retreat back to

the hut to kind of get the rest of their

attention okay yeah I thought we could

try to regroup everyone cuz we got to

get going at this point in time you can

hear the dragon bellow randomly it says

no where did it go well that the two

hits in the head let they hand slip away

oh yeah got away yeah so dragons trying

to sniff the air again and figure out

where it went

good boy Andrew alright

okay DF I would like you to make three

wisdom saving throws my wisdom your

wisdom you you want II one of them the

the one with the sort of black armored

skin says surrender and the other two

say come with us

now I retreated back towards the waffle

hut you sure did and would you say I'm

pretty close to evylyn yes with the bear

with the barrier separating you so good

three or five help me out

yes yes it would okay okay this is

actually pretty good pretty good

alright so two of them are total of 19

okay and one of them is total 26 okay

you are able to resist their spells you

shall be saved

I like felt that like the way through my

brain mm-hmm okay okay all right and

that's the you want ease turn pölten so

hand got away for now yeah

is it is it like coming towards me or

where it scamper off so it is scaring

away from the dragon and away from the

Giants so it's moving as far away from

the Giants as I can kind of

perpendicular to the dragon and kind of

on a not on a direct course back to you

but it's kind of making its way but it's

you can direct it of course because it's

within your telepathic distance but it

doesn't want to bring the danger of the

dragon back to you right away so it's

trying to put as much distance between

all other creatures and it as possible

oh wow

okay and it's kind of moving erratically

trying to scuttle out of view by staying

under stuff and in the weeds and under

the ash and whatnot there's a really

cute chase camp going yeah yeah exactly

the tire weighs 32 palms just like SSE

as a snake people and just drag in the

Giants cat man driving a crossover

like this is all a great setup for like

a finale or something please hold

God okay okay I'm gonna what help help

would oh right that needs help

hello those snakes flanking over the

brain but then the huts gone in danger

okay well look greater good

Diaz face pressed up against the wall

[Laughter]

hmm okay so dimension doors only a

one-way thing right like I wouldn't do

it so I believe you have to let me just

double-check this multifunction here

yeah like I think it's like the entrance

has to be where I am and I can only have

an exit right man yes whatever okay um

I'm going to tell I'm gonna

telepathically communicate to my hand to

be a super sneaky okay just like

seriously like just be just like like

bury yourself okay and I'm going to ah

shoot there's no way to get dia there's

not like a like a consent door I can be

like well he's okay like I can tell like

the bouncers like just feel like no he's

fine he's with us

and he can't get into the hut we gotta

we gotta go dude we can't stay all right

all right everyone's like all right huts

going down we gotta go and I'm going to

hide and then we gotta make our way okay

you grab you take Simon and make your

way down the mound of rubble and there's

there are three you want t standing

between you and your path you haven't

technically taken an action yep you just

ended your concentration on the I've

already blasted them twice yeah yeah

excuse neck headed ones with bows and

scimitars and then there's the black

skinned human with the Golden Circle it

around his neck

do they look relatively beat up or they

stayed in from the the the black scaled

seems to be more resilient than the

other two he doesn't

look as bothered by the damage he's

taken so far but they've all been hurt

okay

can I try to crown a madness on the

blacks c'mon you sure can

cool all right that's not one to cast it

higher spells right spelled like it will

change the DC name but what up and

disregard see what it does

no no okay okay all right but it does

have to make a wisdom saving throw and

it is it will be 13 on it save which is

not enough so a crown of madness appears

over his head just so then just as we're

passing it just lands I'm just like I

just home to go for either one of its

press okay take your pick alright so on

its turn it will start beating up its

friends and next up is bag of nails you

Kris how far away would you like to be

well I think you can be as close to the

Dragon when your turn ends as you desire

okay how about this

can I on this round shoot a harpoon and

then the next round if he chooses to

attack me I'll be dead but if he chooses

not to and attacked Giants I can Ram

them that's what I want to do the

harpoon has been destroyed

oh that's right or damage has been

destroyed it can be repaired you think

but it got zapped by the lightning yeah

there is however on the aft of the ship

a giant cross battle I don't think

that's glorious enough alright so you're

gonna spear it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

it's really good but I'm gonna Ram the



okay he knows you're coming

so make a airship attack I am the ship

out of RAM the ship nice nice okay very

good

just roll this is an improvised weapon

for you so it will be 15 plus your

dexterity modifier okay alright so as

you dive toward the Dragon intending to

spirit through the back it moves in such

a way very cat-like in fact that you

just sort of glide off of it that it's

all you do not pierce its armored scales

and it just sort of shifts to one side

and your ship kind of hits it and then

kind of bounces off and I move actually

jump on this back alright you leap onto

the dragon I'll just have you make a

just gonna pine it

he's gonna buy a plant just make an

athletics check to see how graceful a

jump it is for you alright okay

you sort of go tumbling down you're

trying to drunk jump onto the middle of

his back his neck his head where you

succeed you just don't land very well

and that basically ends your turn as you

just try to cling on to the the Horned

frills and things on his back

Chris I um as I'm on his back my smile

and think of my ancestors okay they're

not too far they're not too far away now

[Laughter]

me next all right it is the Dragons turn

as the ship just sort of drifts off in a

certain random direction the dragon says

you are really starting to annoy me and

then you see that's exactly what it does

and it's actually just rolls on the

ground trying to crush you under its

weight it's pretty cute you know first

yeah and because it's so big you just

hear all those sort of the ruins and

broken stone crunch and crud get crushed

to powder under it's tumbling body I

would like you to make a dexterity

saving throw no because as soon as he is

done his role and his back on his feet

he breathes fire right into the giants

decks a look come on bro keep alive but

dot okay eleven so sixteen okay you

managed to hang on and not take any

damage as he tumbles and when you come

back up you're still on top of the

dragon then you see this huge blast of

flame engulf the three fire giants talk

on nine lives all right

much the bag of nails is just me and I'm

gonna have average damage I'm not gonna

roll all the damage on for these guys so

all three Giants are hit by the flame I

will make saving throws for each of them

they suck at this oh okay no they all

get the full brunt of the flame and when

the flame passes they are all still

standing

nice good but badly badly badly badly

burned

no don't feel pity for them oh right

temporary friends and yes the the two

males who had sort of big frosty beards

their beards are mostly sort of burned

off now their faces blackened smoke

coming off of their hide piecemeal armor

and the their leader

she basically points toward the dragon

and orders her two henchmen to rear

their big axes and charge it and as

these two giants are run forth with

their axes and attempt to hit they make

two great axe attacks each one of them

crits the dragon on one hit and another

one crits the dragon on one hit so the

dragon takes 50 points of damage from

one axe and 50 points of damage from

another axe this is actually good to be

a lot of damage on cloud yes yes focus

and then the the female frost rank she

clutches this talisman which looks like

sort of a blood colored stone on a chain

around her neck and she says to herself

rod and she's looking around and sort of

stopping around the battlefield looking

toward the ground and paltin you see her

kind of even though she's burnt and

charred she seems to just ignore this

the horrible pain that this dragon's

breath must have done to her and she's

stomping in the direction of your hand

and and she's got a good stride so she's

moving faster than your hand at present

and determined and guided by some

supernatural device

in sight get that necklace

evylyn waffles comes out of its hole and

no worse for wear all told just covered

with what appears to be a fine gray dust

when she shakes this huge cloud of

feathers and dust just sort of surrounds

all of you what a good girl the general

consensus I'm getting for everyone is

that it's time to leave

that would be Edith's opinion one last

but we don't okay so I turn to everyone

and I'm like do we want to let the giant

get the ring that seems like a bad idea

mm-hmm let them fight over the ring or I

don't know

let nothing fight of the ring or Paulton

we'll somehow knowing him get it back

here working on it so I don't know what

to we're not gonna run without everyone

I don't know my way into the dungeon I

have to follow - yeah well you're pretty

much all together yeah with the

exception of a bag of nails who you are

who you see has done a round of madness

to sneak people there are I know what I

know what to do with my action I'm gonna

heal up Strix

oh really on I'm gonna I'm gonna go up

to her and be like I was just so worried

about you and just lay on hug okay also

roll some hit points I don't know I just

that's right it's all lay on hands never

mind yep yeah you must enjoy the hugs

more now because you can't smell her no

not at all yeah so uh you said you

needed a lot right well I was about at

about half I'm still at about half you

only have like 50 total I have 44 now

thanks to the desk all right I guess I

just give you 20

all right you that's juicy okay

and death what would you like to do all

right so the the two Yount te that

aren't confused yeah just look like they

are completely distracted by their

ensorcelled not yet because he hasn't

attacked yet and they're not familiar

with the spell so they don't know it's

coming yet okay

from where I could from where I am does

it seem like the weaponry that they have

have familiar-looking poisons like we

saw back at the marketplace important

yawn yes I also forgot my divine my

radiant thing again all right okay so do

it Rhydian someone yeah

vitality is palton hurt well mmm

I mean I'm at like 12 HB yes a little

bit so you can have four excellent oh

thank you

all right so deal all right David okay I

guess I the crowded madness is like a

physical thing that appears above yeah

there's like this weird sort of

scintillating iron crown so I could tell

that Paul that has like yeah the best

I'm not perfect that's I'm counting on

all right so then I'll use that Hardaway

switch to gutter and then engage one of

the young Tebow men okay just to help

Fisher off and I well at the same time

kind of directing to the party that you

know get through them you know we're

going this way said around I'll catch up

fast if I have to or whatever but I'm

trying to because I don't want her

shooting any poison into anyone and

paralyzing anyone okay so I guess just

an attack role all right

have at it alright I'll pretty good it's

like a leap spinning slash from the

rocks going to 26 oh yeah yeah

absolutely you have great

[Applause]

damage okay excellent and as soon as

you're done Strix would you like to do

I'm gonna fireball these snakes okay

yeah I hate them trying to make a path

for us to escape like just three before

it's like okay roll your damage okay

they hate this show it this and your

fireballs big enough that you can get

them all all right 30 Wow okay well then

the one that you just hit DF is

incinerated by the fireball yes are you

trying to hit the one who is in source

'old by the crown of madness uh you know

what no okay I'm not gonna hit that one

alright I'm just gonna let that one dude

do it alright then as soon as you're

done a dragon bait will stride for an

attempt to finish off one of the ones

that DF hasn't attacked yet yeah he will

go over and he will hit it twice and he

will murder it so with that in mind it

is now waffles turn waffles wants to go

and eat a snake good girl anyone want to

stop alright yeah she'll go over and

pounce on some snakes and try to eat one

up oh she hits it twice and she gets

that snake in her beak and chomps it up

into little bits and swallows it and as

she does do you want he kind of changes

back into it's actually do you want to

change back when they die oh no it

doesn't change if it dies so she she

consumes it as a snake and down it goes

no me3 me2

seem very very happy about that and the

one who's got the crown of madness since

the the other two who had reverted to

the you auntie form have died he just

goes around and starts hacking at snakes

on the ground great perfect yes alright

another window

yeah that's move that that is a wide

open window and so he goes around and

starts murdering his snake companions

and that will bring us to do you want to

start to flee from him in there snaky

forms those that are badly scarred badly

burned by strictest flames but still

alive so paltin you see your crazy

deranged crown of madness guy going

around murdering snakes on the ground

with his sword while they try to run

away from him in terror that seems to

have cleared a path in the direction

that death wants you all to veer off

into at the same time you can sense that

your hand is about 90 feet away okay and

I'm trying to do exactly what you told

the to which is to be stealthy lie low

bury itself whatever how many charges

are on the ring is it is there one left

you I believe you have two because you

use the cone of cold against the dragon

that was the last time you used it so

there are two charges on the ring left

right that was an interesting choice in

retrospect so Chris Perkins question yes

Kenda hand use the ring hey yeah it's

your hand I will say yeah because it's

telepathically connected to you you can

basically use the weight ring remotely

with the hand okay I want to use a

charge to make a sleep storm so that

it's slippery terrain so the Giants

can't get to it

okay up to us okay so basically creating

the storm between you and the Giants to

hinder their ability to follow you oh

yes all right so those of you who can

sort of looking off in the direction of

the other chaos going

in the city can see just the weather

change in the vicinity and this the

sleet start to fall from the sky

controlling the weather is pretty

impressive

evylyn is very impressed yep okay and

then paltin just sort of books along

with the rest of the party bag of nails

you are on the Dragons back there are

two giants right up to the Dragons

smashing it with their gigantic axes and

you're on its back and the the boat the

the UH the unattended ship is just kind

of going off in a random direction just

over the ground it'll probably

eventually hit some ruin or building in

the city if it just keeps going in that

direction but who knows it's unpiloted

right now oh but it feel like it's a

double move to eat to that rope the the

ship rope yeah so here's the interesting

thing it's still dragging that ladder so

like the ladder is a sort of dragging on

the ground behind the dragon right now

yes you are back yes you are and it

looks like it would be it's not even

sure that you're well probably knows

that you're still there but the Giants

are obviously a more clear and present

danger to it you have any sense of how

damaged this dragon is you can try you

can try to ascertain that with an

insight checker for you a wisdom check

so you're plus three on the roll it's

taking like a couple of hundred okay you

have no idea okay I'm gonna take two

shots on its back point-blank I'm gonna

flip off my move action to head back

towards the party okay do that sure but

when you look in that direction you can

see what appears to be an absolutely

ferocious winter sleet storm mist that

has sprung up out of nowhere okay I know

I do that although it would be a great

way to hide from

dragon I don't have the hip points I

mean I really have for him I mean if I

fall wrong and sprained my ankle I'm

dead yeah all right but make it make

your attack rolls you got to attack

rolls roll the floor

okay with your +12 that's not gonna be

enough to get through its armor and they

13 okay that does pierce the second

attack does pierce its armor all right

so that is a sorry da +8 yes correct

so that's eight 19 19 excellent so

that's my that's my attack action yes

and drop oh no no no weird I see on the

back of the floating vessel I see the

the crossbow yeah I'm gonna take my

action to flip off and go hustling

towards that room okay and get let's

climb the rope and then attack with the

the crossbow you'll be able to get to

the rope and up onto the deck of the

ship at the end of your turn let me give

you a dex role for that jump off oh sure

friend so I do it was awesome all right

yes

so you skitter back to the ship and

climb up onto its aft castle and that

brings us to the dragon and the Giants

the dragon is going to mmm see if it

recharges its breath weapon

it does not nice it is going to take one

of its ones and detonate a fireball

right around it so it just boom plants

one rated its feet engulfing the two

giants and it would have engulfed you

two but you're gone nice so giant Sunday

alright the Giants failed they're saving

pros and so alright both of the Giants

are completely engulfed and when the

smoke clears they are both still alive

but horribly horribly horribly burned at

this point the fireball wasn't big

enough to get the female giant cuz she

has wandered off to try to find the hand

and the ring and let's see then it is

going to provoke a tax of opportunity

cloth as it moves away from the dragon

by taking to the air the Giants will

both take two swings and they don't one

of them is going to hit the dragon and

give him another walloping blow the

dragon you can tell is bloodied guys

we're gonna kill a dragon

well kill the dragon has a word the word

you've told about the soul mantra so he

has got to be scared for his life at

least a little bit right and then even

though it's no alright and no attack of

opportunity for you you're too far away

and the dragon takes to the air and

flies up about I'm gonna put him about

80 feet in the air so he's got a good

aerial view of pretty much everything

around him he the waffle crew because

you guys are tucked in the walls of the

palace can't see the dragon even at that

height it's probably better for us that

means we could Kylie but you can hear

its wings beating

we can fly week goes down it's true you

know it's a beast is literally kill you

guess whose turn it is evil in Hawley

will literally kill me in real life that

it is evil in CERN just saying okay is

there smell any danger from snake people

currently that danger has been averted

because the crown of madness Oh what's

his face gets a saving throw against

that doesn't he

at the end of his turn right on

subsequent turns blah blah blah blah

blah also you can make it wisdom saving

sure at the end of each of your turns to

end a spell so I forgot to do that is

the crown of madness still in play

answer is yes he is still affected by

the madness go ahead

evylyn is like like reaching toward the

dragon like pointing like what we just

could and I imagine that Diaz has her

arm was like no no no no no like pulling

her back so even just tries to start

leaving with the party in the past that

they okay but she's gonna can she hold

action just with her axe in case anyone

who comes near that she would just

attack or know if we're retreating I

can't do that hum now okay so nevermind

this decider aura yeah and I feel pollen

again you get six this time yeah it

doesn't last that long though Chris it

lasts like a minute I think so maybe

let's say let's say it's gone now so

poof it goes away

you all feel yeah but the last one I'm

like I tinnitus heal at all time like

six more excellent DF even is following

your path good everyone come on alright

yes again trying to take the shortest

path I think is possible if it means

knocking down a wall whatever it is I

yeah whatever it to get inside this

freaking tomb out of danger when you

can't goddamn reach us okay are you

going you you run you double

I met with all your party members and

you do reach a point where you do want

to punch through a wall what do you want

to do to get around the wall

pull out that horn mash it all right

blast the horn roll fizzy it's awesome

like I'm like sprinting count it now

they're closed

I like hop up pull out the horn and like

land on my knees is Paul

all right roll % co nice to see how your

horn fares don't blow up please don't

blow up oh my got a hundred excellent

all right so you blow the horn a big

blast hits the wall and just blows a

huge 10-foot diameter hole into it

debris flies back away from you and it's

just this perfect new archway that

you've created well not perfect it's

kind of yeah it's okay but you hop yes

once you do you hop through and your

party members quickly follow yeah that

was really scary because the double zero

landed first strix I assume you are

following yes I'm also on my broom I

don't want to step on anything okay yeah

okay and dragon bait and waffles is

following along to paltin simon same huh

yes so at this point the hand can't

really catch up because we're running

yeah right yes but does it doesn't move

about as fast as we do yeah it's got a

speed comparable to yours okay so I can

at least feel that it's still like

keeping the same distance and like like

just following us is that what you

wanted to do is stay within your

telepathic range and try to follow you

yeah you can't leave the ring I'm not

allowed so yes it's gonna gonna keep

following us okay evylyn is like by the

way as her running being like but don't

we want to finish it off like he'll be

real mad if he doesn't die maybe we just

usually this deal the opportunity to get

mage hand over evil as well the so the

crown of madness is still in play

so as you step through the hole that

made in the wall as a shortcut to get to

your destination once you get through

that you will no longer be able to tell

you'll be out of sight of the crown of

madness wielding crazy guy if I utter

already crossed the room I am I like

right up to it you're right up to it you

look back and you could see he's they're

whacking snakes on the ground with his

sword

did I see if he has any like projectiles

like does he have an arrow or like

crossbow or anything very good question

he does have a short bow yes but he's

not using it currently he's using his

great sword am i able to redirect him to

try and attack the dragon nice that's a

good question

good one yeah well actually I'm not sure

if he's direct a bull let me just double

check the spell okay no yeah you can

yeah you can totally send him off all

right stop killing his subordinates and

go recharging after the dragon all right

guys good news snake eyes on the dragon

not sure what he'll do but it's

something all right and then you step

through the hole on the wall and he

disappears from sight bag of nails you

climb up onto the back deck of the

drifting ship the unmanned vessel and

you mount onto the crossbow you can see

it's it's locked and loaded so I you can

try to angle the crossbow up yeah I'll

take two shots at the Wyatt how many

shots do I get I get two on a normal

turn you get one shot with the crowd of

all those eighty feet so I'll take a

shot with my bow okay then I'll go to

the cross all right you can only shoot

you can only shoot one weapon or the

other about do I have a say because I

don't really know how much cuz I had two

shots with my bonus

I have a house crossbow will be you've

never shot it congratulations

[Laughter]

yeah he's eight beat up how far away am

i up for simplicity I'll say he's 80

feet away from you

okay little triangle all right yeah um

I'm gonna shoot the crossbow okay is

this what DF wants me to do yep

Darren wants me to do that sorry she's

the crossbow

I wrote 15 you kill this dragon this is

gonna be the most legendary guest let me

just tell you what I do okay go ahead

I'm gonna grab the steering wheel

rolling around and aim it it's

belly oh so you thought you could fire

the big crossbow and then you jump over

to the wheel yeah turn the shoulder up

okay now first of all you rolled a a 15

you said all right so the the the

crossbow is plus eight so 15 plus eight

is twenty three his armor class is 22 so

you did hit guys the classroom could do

you think a colossal slayer on a

crossbow how does that yeah absolutely

not only that but you didn't know this

but it's loaded with a arrow of dragon

slaying so I need you actually I have to

make a saving throw for the J yeah

actually yeah this might this might not

work as expected he's guns gonna kill a

dragon

the Dragons gotta make a constitution

saving through prom dude it's what I'm

here for

it's like the only thing I can do

okay the dragon did save against it so

instead of doing just 3d ten points of

damage if it had failed at save it would

have taken an extra six D ten points of

damage but it made it so it takes an

extra 3d 10 damage so you'd do a total

of six D 10 damage it's still a lot yes

there's a lot of damage yes and then a

daddy ate four colossal slayer and then

a daddy ate four colossal slayer

cautiously they feel like that's good so

I rolled a seven okay seven then now I'm

rolling the d-10 how many tens 60 10 hey

you're counting J yep

so nine three seven we roll because it

went out favor

two four six that's funny trivia nine

sixty 10 right Oh

take off that last night I think okay

damn I just lost track reroll sure seven

plus okay well roll the tenth row six

times yep six six three eight eight nine

nice six Wow eight okay that's it all

right so 9 17 26 32 40 extra points on

top of your 7 is 47 points of damage

all right when the arrow slices into the

dragon it lets out the most horrible

wail you've ever heard the dragon is not

killed but you would you think based on

the sound that it's making it has never

experienced any such sharp pain in its

life and yes and as soon as it's hit it

sort of shocks it for a minute there

that it almost forgets to fly and then

regains its senses and starts flying but

you see it just flies off like a like a

scared British school child

yeah so it just and it's just screaming

at the top of its lungs as its flying

away like it's got the hi so you

hop over to the wheel and you start to

turn this big chip around toward it and

start to chase after it as it goes it's

a good day to die it is a good day to

die and at the end a bag of nails action

and all the rest of the party by the way

here is this horrible screen and you're

like is it dead is the dragon dead it

sounds like a death scream you guys we

killed a dragon and then you sort of

hear more flapping rings ding and they

get a little bit more faint and right

you think that the dragon will outpace

you in this giant thing maybe there's

maybe there's a way to amp up the

propeller of this thing you don't know

but at the rate you're going you're

gonna lose steady ground but you know

hunts are never easy

yeah and waffle crew you are making your

way along evil India Strix palton

company palton you sense I laughter

might get a check for her that your hand

has stopped following you and you

realize telepathically that's because

the frost giant is is standing in the

middle of the seat storm with the hand

in her clutches and I'm still under the

hand sir I'm still under the Rings

control that's correct so you stop

running

I stop running

alright the rest of the party moves

ahead of you d/f as you glance back and

whatnot as you all glanced back you see

that paltin has not no longer following

the rest of you Paulding come on they

got the ring dead All Right see ya know

then he runs back the other direction no

doctrine she tries to tackle him

yeah even uh when your turn comes around

you've got well paulten what's your

speed I think it's 30 feet yeah if

you're if you're running across the

ground it's 30 feet all right yep it is

and you're flying speed evylyn is 30

feet so you can chase after him we're

all chasing after him come on we're not

leaving him behind

no stray tricks is like no no no we'll

just pick him up you can pick him up

it's fine you're strong let's go was it

my way was that was that actually my

turn yeah you said on your everybody was

basically following the same course of

action until you realized something was

wrong and then you stopped so it

happened on your turn basically and

model I didn't realize that was my turn

but you know even what else would you

like to do okay I'm gonna use my last

slot and dimension door toward the ring

to get there faster there you go okay

well you can get right there okay cool

I'm there

alright you appear in the middle of your

slick little sleet storm you see this

towering 24 foot tall frost giant as'

scarred by fire she doesn't seem too

troubled by the sleet it looks like

frost giants are really good at walking

in these winter conditions and she's got

your little hand in what you assumed to

be her fist and does she can I appear so

isn't initially interest me yes when you

first appear she is too preoccupied with

the hand and barking at her henchmen to

even notice that you're there okay cool

that's your action yes I still have a

charge left on it it does and the rest

of you just see palton step through a

door and then it closes behind a zip

[Music]

how far away away now from whom from

paulsen you don't know how far are we

away from the battlefield about a

hundred feet hey whose turn is it or is

it all of us well after paltin would go

the next person in the waffle crew

initiative will be a bag of nails so bag

well what course of action would you

like to take well I feel like we're in a

good a good little point of our

relationship mm-hmm I could you know

that could continue on the Dragon Quest

I don't feel like that's what he really

wants or I could turn around and go try

to help mm-hmm I'm gonna leave it up to

you I I think the I think he's looking

to die in glory okay I'm never gonna

catch it the groan dragon I don't really

care about dying in the Dragons grasp

right well yeah there's it's an

interesting call because you know

there's no foe mightier than the dragon

and in its wounded state should is more

vulnerable than it's likely to be in a

long long time so you have the you have

the best sort of fighting chance of ever

defeating this legendary monster and

distinguishing yourself in the annals of

history by being the first to back see

ever to kill an ancient white dread

dragon in the history of the universe

and as far as working for and you know

that you know the dragons gonna go to

ground somewhere sometime and you know

you're not using any of your energy I'm

fine with that okay I will continue on

the journey to murder the glorious

dragon all right close close close

please claw all right so Klaus nemesis

takes the acquisition zinc air balloon

and just sort of slowly methodically

begins hunting down his

did where my prey Godspeed yes and

you're just there at the captain's wheel

oh all right you give yourself some hit

points all right and who knows maybe

you'll find some crew on the way all

right awesome

that is amazing you still have those

crossbows and stuff it's true probably

do a better job than him nerd all right

and wait till you find out what's hidden

in the hold

anyway what that's a story for another

time folks but to round out to the

initiative count right after paltin

disappears through his doorway

evylyn you would be next up in the

initiative order as soon as I ensure

that the rest of the party is coming

with me I just double move follow him

okay

do you want to stay around the the walls

where you want to fly up over the walls

okay okay then I'll have you make a

perception check to see what you see 19

all right yes you can see palton tiny

little figure standing behind this frost

giant ist's who doesn't seem to be

engaging him in any meaningful way

suggesting then he hasn't noticed that

he's bapt there and they're sort of in

the middle of what appears to be a

petering out sleet storm and the ground

all around them is covered with snow and

the parties still see me since I'm

flying

they can see you yeah so I just I just

point okay d/f what do you do on your

attorney

let out a very noticeable audible grunt

frustration okay and through the broken

walls too you can actually kind of see

parts of the crumbled down tumbled down

palace which is sort of your ultimate

destination in the heart of this maze

you're like it's right there so I

couldn't so looking back

can I see what paltin is currently

engaged with no there are too many wall

barriers between you and he you being on

the ground you don't have Evelyn's high

vantage point but she's going like this

evylyn how many it's just the one right

there three surviving Giants but there's

one close to palton and the other two

are being called over he was like three

god damn it a cunning action - double

move search his way back uh trying to I

guess making his way towards Webber

Bolton is okay dragon bait starts just

smells like frustration yes he one

doesn't she smells like hero is all

right nice and he'll make he'll follow

you back and that brings us to Strix

sort of ending where we started you're

faster because you have your broom yes I

will get as close as I need to to cast a

fifth level fireball on the Giants and

Paulsen where they are okay because I'm

done with these I'm done with them

they're already hurt can you fly up high

enough to do that I can zigzoo my broom

up and fireball has like a really high

yes distance yes so yeah you can fly up

60 feet let loose the final 50 feet so I

can stay 150 feet away and yeah you

basically just fly straight up where you

are see the battlefield just drop the

fireball on top of them all Roley or

damage I'm just gonna bring up the dice

roller cuz it's easier just sitting

there like yep just going around him I

put it in the wrong thing I'm just using

the dice roller because it's too many

and I can't count what - yeah that's all

the only one she has alright well I'm

gonna have to roll real dice and use

real math which is too hard for Holly

so we'll help four five six so I'm gonna

go that's eight twelve thirty-two so

it's actually not that much okay as your

detonation goes off the two male frost

giants are blown off their feet their

axes go flying through the air and

they're incinerated blackened bodies

just land with a kaatham down on the

snow and sleet and they both expire the

female giantess who also took it all

engulfed by the flames she just sort of

weathers it she crunches her eyes up

clenches her fists and just sort of

stands in the middle of it and takes it

all and is still standing when all is

said and done and of course palton is

not touched in the least although all

the snow around you palt and all the

sleet and stuff is just sort of melted

away by the fireball blasts and then

drue fee will see where the fireball

came my god stupid giant she says love

and that's where we'll stop and Chris

really quick is the steak man still just

gonna chase after the dragon on foot all

right
