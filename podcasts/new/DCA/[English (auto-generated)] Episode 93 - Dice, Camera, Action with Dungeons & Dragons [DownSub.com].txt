body and just a few seconds ago jared

was barely able to contain his poker

face yeah welcome to dice camera action

we're D&D can be fun and full of tears

at the same time and last week the

waffle crew left port and ions Iroh on

the brazen Pegasus a sloop that could

outrun any pirate vessel avoid Imperial

entanglements and make the Kessel run in

some summer some real distance and as

they were leaving the bay of chalte they

had an encounter with Aramaic the dragon

turtle and an encounter with evil palton

who pulled DF s key out of the black egg

bomb causing it to tick down until DF

wisely stuck a new key in and long story

short evil palton and the egg were fed

to the dragon turtle the egg the key

taken out of it the bomb exploded having

huge calamitous effects the ship was

pushed on a wave out of the bay of Kult

the shock wave went over port nyan Zaru

blowing out windows toppling statues and

[Music]

also as the people sort of stand near

the the markets and in the harbor they

see this great swell of water come at

them slam into the breakers go over the

lighthouse and flood into the harbor the

waffle crew carried on this wave escapes

serious harm thanks in great measure to

the talents and skill of the crew of the

brazen Pegasus who were able to keep the

ship basically riding the wave the

entire distance and as you spill out

into the open sea you saw or as you

recall there were

great storm clouds closing in upon you

and threatening even more danger ahead

you can see captain Horta may and her

crew are well aware of the storm that

they're heading into and are already

bracing the ship for that conflict what

do you guys do when the waves finally

settle so the moment that the everything

kind of settles everyone kind of has

that moment to kind of look at each

other and remember that they're all

still alive and they're okay

d/f runs to the back of the boat towards

port Diane's aru and just tries to wow

look back at it I'm not entirely sure

how far away we are from it you're a

good distance you wouldn't see much

without a spyglass okay so with that he

immediately turns back to the rest of

the crew and in a panicked voice starts

saying can you watch c-can you would see

everybody back there's okay right no one

got hurt they're all okay for tonight

the port they're justified right

everything's okay and just constant

repeating that almost enough panic as he

looks at the crew and looking back at

the at the port trying to see what kind

of devastation could have possibly

happened

okay well that's happening strikes is

gonna throw up over the side of the ship

right okay what are paltin and evylyn

doing

I think hadn't called or even had

grabbed onto Paulson when they were

riding the wave I think yeah that that

sounds right yeah so I think she's still

like just like clutching him in shock

and everything we're really really hard

Paul yeah and she's just like looking in

confusion at everything that happened

and she had just asked him like why did

she choose that when everything blew up

and now des blubbering and he is asking

like everything's okay right and she's

just going paltin is you recall your

your mandolin went into the beast as

well with your evil doppelganger oh yeah

that's right I don't think he forgot

okay

halten just kind of he's just like

staring out like I'm assuming like kind

of in the direction from where we like

got blasted from he's just like just

watching as like where the mandolin

still well I guess was now but now it's

probably just in pieces as it just like

is slowly still just like going further

and further away she's like great Chris

can you confirm that our were their

actual pieces of the mandolin floating

in the sea because I thought evil palton

had grabbed it he did went into the

beast yeah he grabbed it and then got

bait as he was being thrown by Eveline

Eveline sorry into the maw of the

creature he took the mandolin off her

and the two both he and the mandolin

went into its mouth right basically I'm

trying to ask for if there's a any signs

of Kill Confirmed oh yes so you can

probably see evidence of matter falling

from the sky and landing in various

points in the sea out quite a range and

some of the piece you see actually what

looks like part of a large flipper oh

god okay definitely kill can crash down

into the sea and you see some smaller

and identifiable bits that could be

parts of the dragon turtle or they could

be Birds and it could be fish you're

you're not exactly sure but there is

meat falling from the sky oh right okay

I'm gonna

if any of this was evil paltin sized

meat or really hard to tell right okay

yeah you don't see it you don't see any

confirmation of Paul Tain's demise or

the destruction of the mandolin I think

as evylyn sees falton kind of like

staring where the mandolin was she like

kind of Tears jumped to her eyes and

she's like your your mandolin yeah why

did you do that I had it covered I could

say the same thing

what do you mean it was looking fine

yeah I had the holy symbol raven conned

out and I was talking to him and I said

I had it covered look I'm not gonna sit

here and argue who is wrong he said she

said it's done they're both gone now

so that's all there is to say Dave white

[Laughter]

if you think that's all there is to say

then

that's all the holy simple Raven kind

isn't gone though right she didn't even

get to give that to the guy no she still

has that up Oh

JK then he's like well then look at that

you got to keep your thing bright side

well I would have rather you had your

mandolin than keep this I guess that's

what I would have wanted well doesn't

seem to be the case she looks at death

and she's like why didn't you think I

could handle it uh deaath actually isn't

able to respond as he's sat down in his

back pressed up against the railing of

the boat and it's just elbows up on his

knees and it's just like this if Strix

sees light again just pull him up nope

let's make wrath of his alarm you like

no devil evylyn looks just like

uncharacteristic like usually she's just

usually she's so focused on like what is

everybody else thinking and feeling and

everything and she's just like she looks

like she's kind of at war with herself

um like she's having experiences that

she doesn't understand and so she's just

kind of like looking to all of them to

try to figure out what's next can I find

the captain anywhere yet yeah she is

ever-present on the deck of the ship

yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be like what

you need what you lunch take safety it's

a little bit like give him spyglass do

you have a spyglass captain yeah she

will give you she will hand you her

spyglass and tell you that she wants it

back all right

given your propensity for throwing

things into the water she felt like she

needed to call that out like that's fair

and then she'll just shake it in front

of Diaz face here this what you want

right you'll see it up again you'll see

it and just be like oh no you look you

look you look at you tell me you tell me

if it's okay

I'm just like if I can just grab it from

her

oh sure he's like fine I'll do it

he looks out for a second they're all

dead and he just like he said he said I

saw some bread that's not against what

he said they didn't say a dead uh-huh

stretch so pick and pick it back up I'm

like angrily look at Paul's evil and

I'll try to take a look make a

perception check fifteen as you look a

peer down the mouth of the bay of child

back toward Parton Hines ro with your

spyglass and it's a really good one

she's got a great spyglass and it's even

got like adjustable magnifications and

little lenses that you can pop in and

out of it out of the tube and as you

peer through and you adjust and you

focus and you look and you you actually

do find the city which sort of fills the

circular frame of your view you see

water and people sort of washing out of

the city into the bay water and people

yeah and dinosaurs and other things

especially like super-dead

splashing around the bay unclear at this

range you can also see that the

buildings at sea level many of them

don't look right

like maybe they've been pulled off their

foundations or knocked astray we have to

go back we just demolished that city No

my mage handler mouth no well it would

just be you know hovering there won't

actually stop anything can i actual hand

her mouth yes you need to lie why

because we can't go back why we can't

fix a demolish City College if that bomb

didn't that dragon took the bomb none of

this is our fault bombs don't kill

people people kill I don't I'm not

having this philosophical discussion

right now captain or Damai says in her

her rapid-fire little voice that her

crew can probably get the ship through

this storm okay but she is worried about

you guys you landlubbers she would like

her crew to tie you down for the

duration of the storm so that nobody

gets washed overboard great do it my

favorite thing oh man evylyn is looking

at like mass of death and destruction

yeah and you can see evil and there is

this just absolutely black Thunder head

rolling in toward you off the sea of

swords I I don't think there's any way I

can just leave people need help that's

my job is to help especially if it's our

fault

no no not your fault not your fault and

now your fault just mine that's no one's

fault it was an accident that it's fine

there's Ollie it's you don't even know

they're dead they could be swimming it's

a nice day points a big storm clouds

yeah beautiful day Yvonne's like I wish

I could think of a reason not to but I I

guess I guess I'll go along no no one is

sleeping

no what's leaving I just start tying

evil into the ship I don't know if you

can yeah you see her pull out this rope

and start untangling it in front of you

and this sort puts that sort of walks

around you and around leave a mast did

uh did even know about the because I

know she was separated but about like

that

the secret assassins that were after us

when we were there I don't think so

no all right Pauling just like hey while

we were there there are these people

that almost killed us over a mistake so

imagine what's gonna happen if we go

back after we just blew up their city

well don't we kind of deserve it in this

case

we just demolished people's homes we may

have killed people because we couldn't

make a decision look I understand if you

guys don't want to go back but my life

is forfeit to my cause and I I can't

just walk away from a dying City when

people need my help and it's I mean

maybe we dated it made another voice all

this like go back to the captain and be

like we need help everyone is upset

please captain

tell them why we can't go back to shakes

or a little okay

shake this little dome captain she's

looking like crazy she's got like crazy

eyes she says if I go back there and the

harbor has been destroyed we won't have

anywhere to make birth

well I guess I have to go alone then

you're not going to look tonight just

like kind of takes to the air as she

like gets up

yes actually reaches out and tries to

grab on to evylyn probably like before

arm or maybe by like a shin or something

depending on how close she actually is

and without he isn't able to actually

look at her and make eye contact but

he's clearly addressing her and

obviously trying to hold back tears he

almost seems like he's almost seems to

be like almost shaking to himself a

little bit just hold on to evylyn and

says please please don't go please stay

tell me what to do tell me what to do

that's right I can't don't I need you

right now please guide me you know what

I think is right which is help those in

need but look I mean I did what I

thought was right just now and it didn't

seem to work for you either so and his

this hand on her was kind of slowly lose

its grip and like fall off I'm sorry I

don't

the captain will say to you evylyn can

you bring back the dead kinda some

talking depends how did evylyn why don't

you just send a letter to omen just put

in my hat

he can help he can help more than we can

help

oh no

you know that's true well I mean it

couldn't hurt to have more help

what is one paladin going to do wow I

hate this but she's gonna turn into rats

and go up down below - okay so rats

scatter throughout the ship captain

everybody's like oh not again yeah you

forgot sure here screams down below -

okay you can see evil ins like like her

face is stone but the tears are just

like rolling down her cheeks like she's

she's not crying but it's just you know

coming out of her and she's like this is

one of those moments where what you want

isn't necessarily what's right and you

have to go with what's right I love you

guys and I hope I'll see you again I

don't know well she doesn't - if you say

something she'll stop colleges they hold

up it's there's a difference between

right and just trying to be self

righteous cuz at this point I'm really

getting so sick of everyone just like no

me no let me do it let me do let me it's

like it's like this is this is why every

other day we borderline die you've died

I don't even know how many times at this

point and it's just there's other ways

to solve problems then like let me jump

into the fire and it's it's ridiculous

and like we had a we had a dim solution

and it was working you know it's because

it's I always know what would you do it

I it's like what

what good is a mandolin if I'm dead yeah

none and the problem is none of you are

survivors and it's getting it's so much

it's getting to be way too much now I'm

not saying do you you do what you want

you think going back is the right thing

then it's like sure but I think you need

to figure out what your what your

definition of right actually is I need

to figure out what my definition of

right is this is too much

what why are you even here to begin with

yes you know what I don't know anymore

but thank you that's a good something I

should probably mull over captain or may

still standing next to you evil and says

it makes you feel any better all the

important people have tie up thank you

okay great not me gave me feel much

better no um why don't we tell you to

the mast thing you can think about it

someone she she looks at Paul ten-inch

let's go through the storm first I

honestly have no idea what guides you or

spurs you and I've never asked you to be

anything but exactly who you are but I

Know Who I am and that's a servant of

good

and of lysander and i know what my

responsibilities are and I know that

being that person has saved me time and

time again regardless of whether my life

is forfeit and I can't in good

conscience just leave a mess behind me

and save myself over and over and I

don't expect you to do the same but why

how do you expect me to be someone other

than Who I am you want to go back you

want to get yourself killed

again if you want this to be the routine

then it's your life wasted if you want

what I mean well this is going on Albert

the albear is sister to sitting on it's

bomb on the Duff and just sort of its

head moving turning back and forth Simon

Simon has already tied himself to a

railing and it's just sort of sitting

there up again waiting for the storm I

was just like you know you know you say

you do you know the greater good or

whatever I don't know I don't know if

like lawful stupid is an alignment

that's what I'm getting by you you say

you care about people and it feels like

you don't even consider what it puts

them through when they have to watch you

die over and over what do you mean

that's what it means it means sort of

means you know you say like oh I care

about my friends and care about mama and

yet you're still just lay oh well you

know still just like you know going get

myself killed and you don't think what

that does what that does to what that

does to D F what that does districts

well that does to me you think it's fun

so I don't know in a weird way maybe

stop thinking about yourself by thinking

about yourself you actually care

enough to where this is getting too

annoying for me to deal with and if this

is gonna become the routine then well

that's that's a toxicity I don't want in

my life

huh lack of a better term sure well

honestly I just I wasn't sure you guys

actually needed me considering I tried

my best to manage that and none of y'all

seem to think that I had any of it

handle there's a bunch of rats by the

way coming out from underneath the ship

okay and they're all holding little

scraps of food that they've stolen from

the kitchen electively it's a meal next

to deer they're just dropping little

bits of food they're definitely covered

in rat spit and they're listening to the

whole conversation just looking up it

evil an important one rat brings evil in

a piece of food anyone even notices dear

like basically melting and kind of looks

back at Pelton and you see some

recognition kind of dawning on her she's

like I do you know what it's like to

love someone who has a higher calling

and it is tough and I do know how it

feels to be left behind

Stuart's can I write that letter to omen

the rats all look up you can drop their

food but no there's food all over the

deck and they'll call esque it's like 50

horrible strikes all this color hat off

and just like hand it to you and be like

Oh

we need you why would you ever think

that we did it and then just lie on the

ground and start tying a rope around

herself

Alton chimes in on that he's like yeah

like needs you

you like points to death it's like look

at that look at that mess he's covered

food now points to strikes it's like

pretty sure she's God must killed more

than anything the Strix is quiet but

Simon just sort of hugs to that you know

what that's fair so it's like yeah yeah

you're needed if that makes you feel

better than you're near because we are a

mess like good lord

oh yeah I look at this I'm just like

what that I am still here and not dead

which if this point is impressive as you

look around to polt and you see that

captain or to me she's just sort of

nodding to crew and the crew or just

sort of giving each other signals

they're doing everything in absolute

coordination perfectly like there's not

one stray machinery in that straight

gear in that machine they're just so

well oiled so together they they know

exactly what their roles are and what

they have to do to survive we all sit

and watch and feel real dumb and they

say they seem entirely focused on the

problem ahead not the Brawn behind for

the record when the captain autumn a

said she wanted to tie it down was that

especially my tie you just basically

secure you to the ship so that when that

when the waves start coming you guys

aren't heaved over thrown over blown

over by the wind or whatever other

calamity can happen during a storm

basically so the mask to the railings to

the stairs whatever there's not enough

room below deck or is it just cargo uh

well there's there's a lot of cargo down

there but it's generally a topside at

least you can see what's going on

and you won't like drown if the lower

deck flood oh that's fair

gotcha clearly doesn't know much about

ships yeah okay

just wondering I guess death will like

kind of reach out and flip over and grab

a rope and just really slowly and

pathetically try to like tie it around

him one of the crew members will come

over to you he's sort of a young

youngish man with floppy blond hair and

he'll come over and help you okay tie

yourself off securely great do you have

a preference as far as like being tied

up to the like forecastle half-caste

after middle mast okay I guess the

middle ish okay yeah all right yeah I

guess we should probably make storm -

huh well I guess if we're both sticking

around I know I am against your call ah

maybe Lysander did give me this family

for a reason she goes and helps tidy it

down and then also writes a quick letter

to omen saying dear respectable mr.

drawn thanks again so much for that

whole resurrection thing it's really

helped a lot we had a little accident in

court nine sorry

we would appreciate it very much if you

would help the good people there

we'd owe you one love yours

affectionately xoxo

this is evylyn a Valona Helbig Martha

they had Minos districts yeah yeah

strikes will proofread it so that some

of that message is likely to get cut off

in the sending but you know whatever

yeah isn't it on like she wrote it on

paper yeah yeah well she'll proofread it

yep and add plus Strix at the end you

should have a deep deep deep down into

the Hat and then you don't feel it there

anymore yeah okay

she also sends a cookie I probably can I

probably can't do more good with help as

opposed to just running headlong into

something and I've always had a problem

with that I suppose that's good advice

Thank You Paulding you can see that a

couple crew members are they've sort of

laid ropes out so that you can tie

waffles down the albear has not

permitted any of the crew members to

perform DF is already tied up yep being

sad so strict will help tie down waffles

okay

evylyn and paltin if palton is helping

are you helping Pompton sure palton will

that problem waffles is a sort of get

down low so that you can kind of lash

put the lashes over her back and things

like that so she sort of pinned down

flat on the deck and you throw her a

little stick of these snooze to keep her

happy yeah yeah I should still keep

throwing her things yeah if you're

probably right across from Simon's

you're just staring at him probably at

least it's not making jokes no that's

true I think evylyn will tie down next

to death okay and then kind of like grab

it and just say really quietly I'm sorry

idiots will respond and it's not

entirely certain if it even respond

directed at evylyn but he'll say I'm

sorry too and then with that kind of

takes the moment to himself and actually

will look up at paltin and we'll say

paltin I'm sorry I it's not that I

wasn't listening to you it's just I know

I didn't listen to you

I just the pomace danger and I wanted to

get rid of it I'm you were right and I

should have listened

tone replies he goes okay alright so

evylyn and tied down together Strix

where do you want to be tied off to do

can I use my broom your broom can I just

warm can I just like just get blown away

is it strong enough to like hold me

hovering in a storm around the boat to

make sure everyone's okay you don't know

now but if you ask the captain she'll

tell you that would be most unwise all

right the Strix goes back to thinking

about paulsen saying she got everyone

killed

thanks for a second again tonight okay

up do you want to be tied up like near

waffles kind of dearly like to a stair

staircase yeah I'll get tied up near

waffles okay

everyone else is being so Moody and

upset and saying sorry to each other and

no one's talking to strikes and socials

tires off the batter

all right somebody will help you with

that and that leaves palton is the only

party member currently untethered oh uh

if I can I'll I'll uh post up next to

Simon okay no problem it's like look

over Simon as I'm tired of whom just

like you listen to me oh yeah no one

healed me by the way - thanks guys well

well your healing machines tied up now

so yeah I'm bleeding out hates tricks I

know if I noticed that yeah all untie

myself and go healer okay

not much healing Deb left just like

Pilate uh uh I already healed her once I

I think I had like yes because she was

badly injured by the dragon turtle at

the end of yeah last times game when she

dug down to get the etske no you know

what when even Locke's walks up Strix is

like don't and she heals herself oh

does masker wins on herself all right

honey

Jean I was like her hands were already

glowing for lay on hands and she kind of

looks at Strix like a little hurt Strix

just love services we need you but we

need you we don't need your powers we

don't need things that aren't you we

need you

what does that even mean she says that

now evylyn what she says that now justly

yeah after she was complaining about not

being healed yeah

she's mad look I'm sorry let me know if

you need more paulsen are you okay yep

yep you all right I wanted what evil and

actually says that to to dia yeah it's

probably not hard for her to notice that

death is actually looking over at palton

in Simon and observing them interact and

there is a hint of envy and DF face

halten are you gonna tie yourself down

yeah he's being tied down by the crew

next to Simon presently so everybody

else is secured except one yeah

I guess she was like okay and you just

goes back when you go back to where you

are they'll tie you down as well

because obviously if you got yourself

out of your own tying ropes it wasn't a

very good alright job so you're all

bound securely waves slam into the ship

merciless the sky has turned as black as

night the storm has been battering the

ship for hours and with every rise and

fall it feels like the ship is falling

off a precipice and at any moment as it

lists back and forth could flip

completely upside down or so it seems

yet never does the bashing of the waves

against the hull makes it sound like the

hull is splitting apart and yet the ship

holds together and with each bashing

seems no terribly worse for wear every

once in a while you're jolted and

alarmed by a lance of lightning that

pierces the darkness and strikes down

into the sea behind waves so high you

can't really see over them and one of

them actually strikes the mast of the

ship and seems to just kind of absorb

into it and not damage the mast at all

how's the ship made out of and one that

later

yeah you try to you might even say that

to yourself

and then just sort of get a mouthful of

seawater the water washes over the ship

all of the time and the the the

conditions have gotten so bad that

captain or to me at some point during

the storm basically ordered most of her

crew tied down as well except for

herself and so she alone seems to be

guiding the ship over waves

she has tethered herself or rather

hooked herself to the wheel of the ship

you can't see her very clearly up there

because she's a small figure but you do

see the wheel turning

every once in a while and then the waves

just wash over and you think oh my god

she's gone she's gone and yet the wheel

continues to turn attesting to the fact

that she's probably still up there the

rest of the crew is just as soaked as

you as the waves slam above the deck

waffles is just drenched and every time

the waves sort of flow over sing songs

to her from back when they were they

were alone like Petter and sing songs

like it's like hearing a weird creepy

songs coming from yeah occasionally

water comes up from below and just sort

of boils up out of the hold and splashes

around you and pours off the deck of the

ship the creaking crashing creaking

crashing I'd like you ultimate

perception checks 18 oh yeah also 18

excellent 29 debug your muted I was

muted

I got a 19 okay yay and I'm sorry Strix

what did you say you got Oh 18 okay you

all see at one point as a after a wave

crashes over and your ship leans

precariously forward that you are

surrounded by some jagged peaks of rock

that that are thrusting up out of the

sea and somehow miraculously haven't

struck one of them but on one of the

rocks clinging to it you see an immense

maybe 26 to 30 foot tall being a woman

with purple skin and green kelp like

hair clinging to the top of the

and casting some sort of spell and

you've never seen a giant like this

before this is fine counter spell that

me too absolutely like the crew happens

to notice let me just check to make sure

that counter spell doesn't have any

somatic components actually if Strix

sees it she'll make eye contact with

paltin I'm like kind of like I'm sorry

requires somatic components and you guys

are tied up Oh No

can I miss you step out of the ropes and

hood yes but then you must be untethered

yeah yeah yeah so you you missed the

step yeah okay how far away from your

current position do you misty step um

pretty close because I want to hold on

to the Rope still so just pretty much

just outside of the ropes okay oh you

appear on the deck as it careens around

and are able to cast your spell anybody

else is doing anything does it seem like

the crew can tell that this thing is

here not that you can see they seem to

have no awareness you're the only one

that's perceptive enough to have seen

all right uh I would like to calmly

point that out okay and by calmly I mean

it's like Oh God by pointing that

direction okay

trying to get the attention of captain

to automate specifically so she can help

steer the ship they don't hear you the

the wind the crashing sea everything

else just completely drowns out your

voice in fact no you're gonna hardly

even hear yourself anybody else gonna do

anything before I resolve the Strix

counterspell um does okay so I'm tied up

does animate object I'm trying to look

it up I'm trying to see if that requires

any kind of movement whoa I just put on

my book

it's not happy it does well you can

dimension door see they don't matter

components no this is mentioned or does

not it's verbal only okay I'm gonna I'm

gonna dimension door like out of the

ropes but like right next to where Strix

is and like also hang on okay alright so

you are both out of the ropes

evylyn you can hear ya saying something

but you can't make out what it is you

can see Strix vanish out of her ropes

and paltin dimension door out of his and

obviously they're gonna looks like

they're gonna deal with the giant does

the need for wait so verbal components

work yes if you have a it's only the

somatic components and material

components you can't really access when

you're tied up so I could summon Morning

Glory

is that just verbal I guess well no

actually hold on why cuz horse

we need a horse is that the fine steed

yeah that that requires somatic

components as well yeah well who okay

even just got a big lecture about not

jumping into things

am i okay so I went our restricts what's

tricks like close enough to Eva and DF

to where I could like yell at least so

they could hear me or is it like pretty

far off they're not far at all but when

you even when you yell they can't hear

you so much rain went wind and other

things the crashing of the waves the

roar of the Thunder okay I think even

was doing the thing where she's like

about to get up and then remembers that

she's not supposed to jump into things

anymore and is just kind of like

decision can she can she like see us

though yeah okay yes I like see her

about to do something and I just gesture

like alright Strix do your so your

counterspell this is what the giant is

doing is a higher level spelled and well

actually I'm getting this confused with

this spell magic I do this all the time

alright you attempted to spell the

creature it is casting a spell higher

than third level so you have to make a

check using your spell-casting ability

got it

I would also like to do that okay please

do so it's just rolling a d20 and yeah I

spell attack bonus your your

spell-casting ability which is namely

modified charisma yeah it's for okay so

it's d20 plus for all and for for you it

would be charisma based as well Bolton

okay so I got a dirty 20 okay I got a I

got a natural 20 or it's it alright well

here's here's the thing is you guys are

standing up and looking around you see

there's actually more than one giant

there's one of our other side in the

ship as well also casting a spell cool

can I use mine on the other one you sir

can you see both of their spells peter

out and just go poof the light and magic

from them effectively counter spelled

and now I'd like both of you has a as

the ship Corrine's and a wave crashes

over to make dexterity saving throws

about to high five I'm sixteen okay

dexterity say any throw drinks the three

okay wait wait are they close enough to

me with any aura yes they would get your

aura bonus to their saving throws okay

five okay so that's an eight so that

halten up to a twenty one which is

paltin as that wave slams into you you

are blasted back by it and kind of

thrown against the ship but you find

purchase easily enough and as you wipe

as you flick your hair out of your face

and the water gushes past you and you

look around Strix is gone okay

can I whoops okay okay so it's like loud

and it's like hard to see and everything

okay I would like to use locate creature

and I will see would that work whatever

uh so yeah you're not come you're not

constrained at this point in time I'm

just gonna say out what the casting time

of the spell is no okay the casting time

for Loki creature is only one action so

that's not so bad okay so yes you can

sense the direction to the creatures

location as long as that creature is

with 1000 feet of you and okay let me

see what else

boom boom boom boom boom that's about

the long and short of it so yes you can

cast that spell alright Strix you are

pulled down into the briny depths

alright well I'm down there can I cast

alter self so that I can breathe

underwater

let me see you can't somatic so there's

no material component you have to dig

out that's kinda nice yeah yes you can

all right sweet I have gills now you

have no bare it's completely dark down

there with your dark division however

you can see the ship is going through

some sort of rocky passage with rocks

rising up on either side of it did I did

I know where she yes she is about five

hundred feet behind and below you okay

all right yeah I look too evil I'm just

like yep flying off in the direction

that Strix would do you've actually

react to use his sword to cut evil ins

rope to untether her you can't get at

your sword dang right up and evylyn

you're just trying to break out of your

ropes is that what you're doing no

you're so yeah I'm gonna try to just

hook it okay

make a make a super-duper strength check

20 yes you're trying to reach in that

awkward place to get your sword and then

you just see her tear herself free then

she just goes streaking off in the

direction

did she perceive at least the direction

that strict Scott I can can I also like

can I tell her can she get close enough

to me and then I can tell her like where

I sense she was yeah you have no bearing

evylyn without pölten actually there's

like a Geiger counter kind of you would

have to like he he can point but the fat

lot of good is the ship is moving around

so much on the sea is churning so much

wherever he points to is not going to be

a if I I can't see this ship but can i

dimension door somewhere the

intervention there door onto a rock

I'm never mind I'll just swim up to the

top okay that's that's impossible

yeah okay so you you summon your mount

which just takes an action right yeah

and it appears it's a it's just a horse

right with with the wing little wings

yeah a horse with little tiny patterns

on its

skin shaped like wings appears on the

deck of the ship I asked her can you

swim the horse gives you a strange look

and then there is a crunching noise as

the ship slams up against the rocks and

I would like evylyn and paltin to make

dexterity saving throws and I'll make

one for the Scoobies make dexterity

saving throws he's good at them you're

safe you're tied up okay so that means

seventeen okay

okay you're all swept off the ship cool

and actually I need to roll some damage

or choosing to was that we should have

just stayed tied up oh my god it's so

amazingly low I can't believe how weak

this storm you each take 43 points of

damage as you are thrown off and go

tumbling over rocks and down into the

the water in this stormy sea Wow and you

can all some splinters of the ship also

sort of peel off and fall around you and

the storm evil and you find yourself

basically on a rock no sign of your

horse anywhere no sign of paltin and you

can see about 200 feet away up on

another rock is one of those giants you

saw earlier a flash of lightning sort of

comes down behind it just sort of

illuminating her briefly and then you

see her come down off that rock and dive

into the water toward you

well that's nice

can I use locate object on Strix --is

staff yes what is the casting time on

locate object well action yes you

totally can

paltin you are down in the water

basically being churned around like

you're in a giant cauldron smash about

floundering around Strix you two are

very much at the mercy of this

tumultuous sea unable to swim anywhere

unable to guide yourself anywhere with

your hands and legs but I can breathe

you can breathe paltin how are you going

to deal with the drowning I don't know

okay question there it's okay there it

seems like swimming would be futile the

current in the turn is too great

okay I'm guessing I can't make a hut

that would have air in it huh

let me check the spell I'll be all get

water beds

because it does not it will not hedge

out the water okay cool

oh no wait oh there is a throwaway line

here which says and it's a little vague

the atmosphere inside the space is

comfortable and dry regardless of the

weather outside and the other thing is

it's a mobile facility you just sort of

create it now you're sort of suspended

in this swirling maelstrom all around

you see all right you cast it it happens

any look surrounding it says is he just

like oh oh wait hold on it takes it

takes one minute to cast at night you

can check out the suffocation rules to

see how long you can hold your breath

this is so sad can we meanwhile dear

aunt tied down on the ship just sees all

this friends go overboard

yes exactly I'm also gonna cast green

flame blade onto my staff so I just want

them I just want my glowing staff like I

want people to spend to see it like bro

actually yeah that whole staff is

glowing as bright as oh wow what is your

constitution modifier okay so you start

casting the spell as you're being

whipped around underwater I'll let you

know how that goes momentarily

I am grateful I look forward to

all right d/f you see after that latest

Slam by the ship that the captain's

wheel is just spinning where's the

captain you don't know but as you watch

that sort of blond-haired floppy hair

'hard kid has somehow wrangled out of

his ropes and is clawing his way across

the railing to get up to the wheel why

don't we just die I guess I'll died does

he look like he's gonna make it unclear

things are looking pretty bleak how

hilarious would it be if those giants

were actually like trying to stop the

storm

that'd be great sure

all right stress did I seem strong that

the Giants strong actually recognized

them as say storm Giants or something

would they would you would guess venture

to guess based on stories that they are

storm Giants cool well I'll let you make

a since you you brought that up I'll let

you make a let's call it intelligence

history check something deeply lacking

right now I got some points in that 12

okay your your sort of historical or

historical remembrances about what storm

Giants are is pretty big he can't other

than the fact that hey they live in the

deep sea and hey there big and hey

they're like among the most powerful of

giant kind right do I remember if

they're generally dicks or not or don't

know okay well that's fine I wiggle free

of the rope make a acrobatics

like I know they tied me down and

they're like sailors and stuff but this

this is just sad tying yeah let me tell

you so so sad a little natural 20 yes

they actually did an A for mental

job of tying you to the ship but it

avails them not as you slip out of your

bonds easily and then I'm going to start

making my way to that wheel yeah you're

sort of clawing your way up the opposite

side of the ship as the young man and

just roll roll initiative to see you I

know you or he gets there first and I

guess I don't know if it really applies

to this but I can cunning action - for

more movement speed and our second story

work as a sort of climb yeah along the

railing for even faster oh absolutely

yes okay roll your initiative nineteen

okay you are definitely going to get

ahead of him you can call your way all

the way up to the ship you see that the

tether cord that the captain had has

broken the captain's gone you don't see

her at all and the wheel is spinning

around but you get to the wheel and can

try to stop it if you want to or steer

it because wrist a spinning so get hold

the hole for the rudders is making the

whole thing but yes lose it and you can

feel the ship just sort of careening as

a consequence over this wave yeah I got

fast hands so I'll just kind of quickly

catch it and whatever strength I have

ever make a strength check to guide the

ship uh would you allow athletics yes

okay because that's one better for me

all right friendship dice ten you were

able to sort of stop the wheel from

turning but you can't actually turn it

the way you want to go okay I got hold

of it at least oh yes you got a hold of

it and you see the young man making his

way up against that the wind he's

shouting something at you but you can't

hear what he's shouting and as that

happens you both he and you have to make

a dexterity saving throw mm-hmm there's

another wave threatened

we're off the vessel 22 okay you hold on

the wave crashes when it passes you are

still holding the wheel fast you do not

see the young man all right so you shake

off the water and yeah you're you're

alone up there on the wheel strix you've

lit your staff what else do you want to

do as you're swirling around helplessly

so I can't can I tell where up is no no

all right

okie dokie hmm well I'm gonna go ahead

just just to be safe and I'm just gonna

death work myself okay just just as a

precaution okay and that's a one action

casting time yes okay so I'm just like

well if this is how this happens I can't

help any everyone if I'm dead but you

just hear okay you're the light of your

staff after you cast the spell

illuminates a giant face that comes up

to you underwater and you don't see it

till it's like five feet away from you

and it is a maelstorm giant lit green by

your staff can I wait yeah when you do

he waves back oh and then tries to grab

you with this if he waves back I'll let

him grab me okay he does but he doesn't

gently and then you see him start to

sort of swim off with you possibly up at

this point I got an eye I'm just like

this is where I live now so I'm just

gonna let him do it okay

evylyn yeah I saw that female

dive down into the water toward you

I had cast locate object on strictest

sky

yes and you got a bearing on it it's

quite way underwater deep underwater and

it seems to be getting closer okay and

do I see anyone else or the boat or like

cauldrons huh or anything the boat

disappeared over a wave and is gone and

you can see bits of the ship that have

crashed upon the rocks left behind but

not enough to suggest that the to you

that the ship like was destroyed that's

you can make a perception check to see

if you notice anything else before okay

rain is battering you it's blinding

the wind is howling just for a moment

she can't even help herself but to be

like ah the rain of my face baring she

has on strikes okay as you are flying

you realize that the ocean is so

tumultuous that unless you're really

really high you're still subject to

being slammed by waves so do you want to

get above that or do you want to try to

move through thread the waves and stay

okay in that case I'll just have you

make a wisdom insight check you're sort

of trying to predict the currents around

you and avoid getting swallowed up

correct 11 okay you miscalculate and are

quickly engulfed in the water and

immediately you're sort of spun around

upside down topsy-turvy all around and

you've lost all sense of direction okay

yep

you see you see a drowning horse go by

[Laughter]

alright

paltin yes you're suspended there you

see a large hand a purple hand come up

and sort of plant itself on the outside

of the shell you're just staring at the

big hand there and then you see this

giant village barely visible in the dark

gloom

I would like to cast pari fire so I can

maybe get a better look at what I'm

dealing with

yeah I know this sounds horrifying which

is good tiny hat does not require

concentration so that doesn't go away

hmm I think it's a dexterity saving

throw mm-hmm it says spells and magical

effects can't extend through the dome or

be cast through it which is why I'm not

actually casting fairy fire because that

was a fool all right I stare at the okay

actually well question yeah uh when I

went over did any of the wine fastened

to me make it with me oh yeah yes I said

that is secured more than you know you

were this hand hits it's like I'm gonna

die here yeah and you see sort of this

other hand grab the sphere and there's

like a concerted effort to try to move

it but it won't budge all right and

let's see nope nope Strix you are

brought to the surface of a lake just

sort of held up above the waves by this

giants hand she got a bath everyone I

hope you're happy yeah and then the

giant sort of pulls itself up onto a

rock that is not currently engulfed with

water

all right can I see any of the ship or

my friends or anyone make a perception

check no all right well I'm still I'm

just gonna hold my staff up and just

wave it hoping they'll see it okay

d/f make a perception check okay

[Applause]

18 okay way behind you as you're sort of

cresting a wave and the storm is

threatening you you do see a green

little glow yeah familiar drew yeah and

it's great waving around in the air

that's awesome news but you can't like

turn the wheel would it be gonna be

faster at this point to just let it keep

turning yeah absolutely

okay yeah yeah all right just make a

intelligence is the raw intelligence

check since seamanship is not yeah I

don't I don't know anything about this

uh five not get him yeah you're not

going in the direction you want to go

well you don't know why Paul tune this

giant face or he's gone never mind

evylyn yeah make a perception check to

try to get your bearings nineteen all

right and your con is high enough I'm

not gonna worry about you drowning for

the foreseeable future oh so you think

yes you you you figured out which way is

up where you think you know which way is

up and you start to swim in that

direction you do actually you can break

the surface with your flying boots cool

and you see a green light I don't weep

in the distance yes and that would seem

to indicate where strix is and the giant

will say to you Strix in me just make

[Music]

but says to you in common if you would

like to be returned to your ship and

I'll say up I'll like look up like oh

yeah I have friends that are also in the

water cute can you if they fell I don't

know what they fell actually but they

probably did knowing our track record so

baby can you help put all of us back on

our ship yes please thank you okay

she tells you that she'll do what she

can and they were trying to help you

she says but their magic failed them for

unknown reason looks really there's like

blinks like that gif of that guy just

like just blinked for a couple minutes

yeah okay so she will sort of swim out

into the water with you that she just

tells you to hold on basically and leave

all and you can see Strix

basically got this storm giantest by the

hair I'm like Titanic hang on yeah as

it's swimming in your direction and the

storm giant seems to be managing the the

tumultuous waves well enough okay

alright well I guess if I perceived that

strict seems to be fine yeah and you see

they go up and down over the waves and

disappear from view periodically but

your spell lets you keep an eye on where

there and the light from her staff

continues to glow every time it comes

above the waves cool glad she's having

fun with watersports we I'm then

eelain's gonna turn our attention to

trying to make sure the rest of the

party is safe okay so can I just

perception check to see if I see any

I can help me make a perception check to

see if you can see the ship you won't

see anybody else is underwater

necessarily well actually no that's not

true

go ahead and make a roll I lied 16 yeah

you you actually with that roll can see

some distance away surfacing on the

water basically staying afloat on a

piece of the ship is a crew member that

you last saw on the deck of the vessel a

blond-haired kid okay she was looking

for pulse in RDS but yeah things being

what they are I suppose she goes and I

mean he's floating does he seem secure

no she goes and helps them alright as

you make your way over to him obviously

how do you make another dexterity saving

throw oh nine okay you are struck by

late weight I get my aura uh twelve okay

yes a lightning bolt from the sky

basically you and your armor they are

serving as this giant conductor and it

actually hits you cool oh yeah awesome

how's that feel that feels like

public a lot of dos that sounds like 72

points of damage and dia as you're

trying to turn the ship you see this

lightning stroke come down and sort of

hit something above the water uh-huh

you're not sure what it was cool you

want to know what's funny what's that

that gets me to exactly zero Alton just

told me not to die anymore

all right evylyn sinks down into the

briny depths though the giant to save

everyone I'm on my way yes

DF make another intelligence check to

guide the ship I'm busting out the

friendship dice

to save friendship 12 okay you are

through force of will able to or luck or

something your your your intellect

ingenuity your ingenuity allows you to

steer the ship back toward this glowing

intermittent green light that you see

and you you almost run it over but a

there is a when you cease tricks you

don't at first looks like she's like put

on a bed of kelp or something and just

kind of floating there and hanging on

for dear life and it's only when this

arm comes up and grabs the side of the

ship I realize she is in the clutches of

or holding on to a storm giantest oh no

it's all life's tricks with

prestidigitation since they can't hear

her yeah above her head in writing it

just says they're nice

so yeah this sort of Sparky writing

appears in the air I really like jagged

it's like very nice one of the ease or

backwards gift looks at it and kind of

gets confused for a moment which makes

them like loose focus I was holding

wheels so you just look at it Stelios oh

right

yes and yeah I'd like you to make

another dexterity saving throw to hang

on as another wave crashes over the ship

oh come on dice work with me as far as

it would be just for strict to say 29

yeah you're good okay all right

the giant is sort of helping you Strix

back on to the ship that's nice

do I get her name there's giant lady

right now just giant lady priorities I

wanted to feel important yeah

giant lady she's points back a giant

lady says thank you giant lady please

get my other friends it seems to be in

chill Ekron she says she will try and

then immediately after putting leaving

you on the deck of the ship dives down

under the water

alright that's good I can Strix help TF

with the wheel like assist with that

yeah I'd like you to make as you make

your way across the wind wracked deck

just make another dexterity saving throw

strikes okay since you're untether a

swear to God oh that's a 9 ok yeah so

she's trying to come over to UDF and

then the ship lists and she just sort of

slides it goes over the opposite edge

whoops not this not this yes you know

that gif of the crashing wave of feels

yes all right I would have grabbed a

rope that that would have been a

successful dexterity saving throw to

grab something you over 9 so so yes

there's like loose rope from where some

of your old friends friends untied

themselves you try to grab onto des old

ropes and hang on Strix but the Rope is

long and loose and you just sort of fall

in the water

gets her yanked out of your grasp by the

tide you just hear Strix young woman

I'll be right back

yeah she's done yeah you're pretty sure

you might have had run her over

no Politan that giant leaves you forded

by it's effort to try to move your

magical hot disappears into the darkness

of the sea do I get the feeling he was

trying to help make an insight check

that's a NAT 20 yes okay I did he

quickly leave or maybe in range like

yeah could I like okay dispel the heart

and as soon as you do the waves just

sort of crash inward against you and

your casts spell yeah I like to light

both me and him and I'll okay yes you

are both lit and when he turns toward

using he he just sort of comes and

you're all you're almost dragged away

from him immediately you've just

suddenly pulled back by the current but

then you see him sort of thrust forward

with both hands and grab hold of you

gentle be gentle he is and he bears you

up to the surface I said and he sort of

hold you up with one hand and then he

kind of dunks down a little bit and

pulls the Strix up out of the water

oh good yeah

maybe a halfling as well it's super

badass halfling Liebig also don't so be

good yeah all right

then he will bear both Strix and paltin

back toward the ship Strix your Strix

you were grabbed Holly you have been

grabbed by a male storm giant who has

paltin in his other grasp and he does it

he's just he's just sort of shredding

water right now yeah we messed up okay I

just want to give up and maybe just

retire yeah

but tried to go home for a while now

yeah he is going to attempt to oh he can

only do it one of you yeah they won't do

that then oh he is going to cast water

breathing on both of you as a precaution

well that's nice so you've already got

it on you effectively Holly but he

doesn't know that yeah Paulding you now

can breathe water and as the water

washes over you you know that is this an

alarming feeling like a little bit oh my

god I shouldn't be able to do this yeah

yeah yes mm-hmm

[Music]

yeah and then the other the giant s

comes over and sort of takes you up

against tricks and the two giants bare

each of you swimming while holding on to

you back toward the ship DF make a

perception check all right 29 at this

point in time you've hit upon the idea

that if you just gotta let the ship do

circles you're not gonna get very far

away from your friends and so you've

kind of locked the wheel into this

motion and the ship is this kind of

coursing up and down waves but kind of

making a lazy circle yeah that's

definitely you can see these two storm

Giants in the water bringing your two of

your friends closer to you awesome I

guess whatever way I can try to adjust

the ship's core course so that it'll

turn in such a way that I judge a guy

how fast they're swimming towards me

mm-hmm

like a star coming up I can make sure

the ship starts making way right around

towards them to kind of they swim faster

than a person can run so they

yeah yeah just try to just try to make

it so that the the giant swimming and

the ship can meet yeah a spot and I'm

trying to control that as best I can

yes you're not able to keep the ship in

a fixed location certainly not with it

like dropping anchor or something right

right so you are moving around but sort

of at the mercy of the storm but you do

get close enough to them that they can

grab hold of the ship and as they get

close they kind of levitate upward to

deposit your friends on the vessel

evylyn you awakened you have 10 hit

points and you awaken to find that you

have just been kissed on the lips by a

mermaid you see this beautiful naked

bear arms and shoulders woman with a

fish-like lower body her hair black and

dark but her eye is a sparkling green

like Jade man whose first kiss is

wearing human again it's a mermaid she's

wearing coral she's wearing some coral

jewelry and you can see sort of sideling

up underneath you is hers Jayant

seahorse companion yeah yes you even

magical adventures it is it is a healing

kiss and you feel instantly sort of

rejuvenated and then when this beautiful

absolutely magnificent pink and violet

seahorse comes up underneath you and

sweeps you up and you see it's got place

you can sort of brains it bears you

quickly and she sort of swims along

beside it and they course through the

waves in a fence full manner to suggest

that they actually

joy it even looks up at levander and

goes and as you as you're sort of you

break the surface they seem to be

bearing you toward the ship as well

which is just careening around the sea

in an absolutely crazy sort of manner

okay that's you to live from you to like

say anything right yeah you can't hear

your own voice barely but your horse is

close enough that you could probably

talk to the horse let's see yours I

don't think she needs to talk to the

skater as you know you can't really find

your voice either I think this is all

very overwhelming yeah well this is

going on you realize this mermaid isn't

alone there are actually two mermen a

swimming escort these handsome creatures

following alongside you this is all very

cool with evil alright palton and Strix

and DF you are on you are unsecured on

the ship and the storm is still trying

to bash you then while aware things are

horrible at that point time you see that

the Giants are again trying to cast

spells and they tell you in their

booming voices which you can hear that

they're going to try to calm the weather

around the ship tricks just like sticks

or hands like in her robes just very

like it sadly like would because of this

would would they would I consider them

an ally at this point if they're if you

believe what they're saying

yes but they tell you they tell you that

they are going to try to stay close to

your ship but that this spell has a

casting time of 10 minutes okay I got

this so they tell you to secure

yourselves okay I was gonna say could

they maybe use some inspiration oh I

don't know I just want to help at this

point yeah yeah they say but they they

kind of look at each other dubiously

alright cool

I would like to use bardick inspiration

okay

giants like bagpipes yeah yeah alright

got it you can always hear through storm

thank you much what are you doing while

he's providing insulation Strix was that

I did what is Strix doing while paltin

is are you singing are you playing an

instrument bagpipes all right yeah

bagpipes on the high seas Strix what are

you doing while he's blaring they still

holding Strix no oh is she back on the

ship

yeah they have to they need their

hands-free to cast the spell so they

deposit you on the ship okay then I'll

just if I can I'll just try and grab

some rope and start tying off deaath and

myself okay

just as best as I can which is not great

but she's just kind of like panicking

we're nice the whole time I don't want

to do this anymore okay

you can see that one of the male mermen

evylyn has fetched the blond-haired kid

out of the water and is sort of carrying

it and you can see the keys I'm cut the

kid is unconscious and it's just sort of

being pulled along by the mermen but you

do get to the ship and you could do see

some stray rope lines hanging off the

edges of the ship where you and your

companions had undone themselves but

they're still sort of sort of fastened

partly around the ship so you could grab

one of those rope lines if you wanted or

you could just fly up at this point do

the mermaids look like there like that

was their goal they don't wanna like

take me with them you don't you're not

sure they have the capacity to they are

basically fish bodied creatures

clamoring up onto the deck of a ship

seems to be kind of alien to them no I

mean like they brought me to the ship

with the idea that they would put me

back on this yes that they wanted to get

you close enough to the ship that you

could pull yourself up or hold on to the

anchor or something so like I grabbed a

rope but I motioned to the lady mermaid

like to come closer she does I give her

like a little peck on the cheek and

smile and then climb back yes and then

you see I motioned to hand me the kid at

all Carrie okay yeah

just make a strength athletics check too

because the weather is terrible you're

getting battered around and

slammed around you're trying to hold on

to this play yeah you're able to hold on

to him

basically kind of drape him over your

shoulders while also pulling yourself up

the rope and heave him on to the deck of

the ship at this point in time paltin

just make a dexterity saving throw as

you're being knocked about ten okay you

are engulfed by a wave and heaved yeah

moments later you are fetched up out of

the water by a dashing Merman

so yeah yeah and he sort of lifts you

keeps you up well above the waves by

which time you can see the storm Giants

are just levitating in the air kind of

hanging there the ship is sort of gone

past them at this point but they're

still incanting their big spells but the

merfolk are able to get you back to the

ship to a point where you can basically

grab some ropes and hang on cool and

they long enough they'll follow you just

in case you get battered off again cool

did they hear enough of my song for me

to have helped they heard like the first

three chords which were great and

probably enough to help them okay cool

I'm gonna so am i upon the ship now

no you're just sort of hanging on the

side of the ship by a rope you can try

to pull yourself up with an athletics

check I okay that sounds like actually

could I actually use animate object and

just have the rope like pull me up on

because I don't trust myself you could

do that cool I'd really just like him

like it to like lift me up and then

immediately time iam yeah so it sort of

wraps around your waist and then you ynx

you up the side of the ship brings you

over top just sort of flops you onto the

deck and then it immediately starts to

spin itself around and tighten all

around you until you're all done up good

it's like either this clears up or I die

in this row and the rest of you see this

rope just all around Kevin Duke died off

all right d/f has sort of managed to

keep the ship on a non-destructive

course he's tied off by Strix Strix

you're tying yourself off near the we

are crying yeah you can see death is

really kind of struggling with this

wheel I'll help him with the wheel yes

please yeah all right yeah it's just

making assisted so you get advantage on

the check yeah intelligence are we

pirates DF doesn't answer why the film

like Strix just grabbing on to like

right we're dia or two yes well you're

together on the real you are one oh

thank God for advantage Akeem okay you

rule the Seas for the next 30 seconds

you feel like a master of the oceans as

you guide this ship and you don't have

any further problems after that point

and then suddenly the waves and

everything just sort of subside and the

sky directly above you seems to open up

you see is he cleared clear sky and and

the Giants are sort of a little bit well

past behind you now and after they've

you can you can almost see this path

ahead through the sea as the sea just

sort of calms in front of you is it just

like that one part or the sea is like

the rest elapsed there's there actually

it's actually getting wider and wider

and wider the safety area they're

literally pushing the storm out of your

path so it's like this is like this V

shape of clear water why ever-widening

in front of you and soon is you are just

the storm is only behind you there's

signs of captain autumn a or any of the

others or anything you have not seen the

captain

but the crewmen who you saw dashed over

who was yelling at you is safely back on

the ship

well thanks to evylyn but captain our

mermaid friends still nearby oh yeah

absolutely

so they they sort of disappeared under

the water and you see the storm Giants

after they cast sink down into the sea

all right at this point the crew members

are starting to untie themselves

realizing they're out of danger and the

first mate whose name is Greg Rudel he's

an older man with a salt-and-pepper

beard a big sort of bear of a human

fellow he basically barks commands and

tells them to secure lines and check the

sail and all that business and makes his

way up toward the wheel okay yeah as

he's doing that day of still holding the

wheel we'll just look over at that guy

and just be like yeah you see him take

the wheel with one hand and not sure

exactly what he did but he makes it look

quite easy cool but yes he he sort of

takes control and the ship sails out of

danger yeah yeah DFO just kind of

relinquished command of the ship and

back away that almost kind of stumbled

back and fall just onto his butt he's

just so sopping wet okay yeah I think

strikes easy to mimic that all right

day six several days have passed you

have left the distance storm behind your

your ocean oceanic saviors a mystery the

the captain was lost when the ship

struck the rocks and captain Rudel has

taken command you see that the crew

suffers from her absence both

emotionally and in terms of their

ability Rudel is a much more sort of

Rusk and not as not as effective a

communicator as his captain was so he's

struggling a bit to keep spirits up

maybe they just need a nice song whole

thing can you play them a song can you

hear people up Palmas decide he's still

tied to the show never know when the

next door might come man Paulding just

like looks to them like when they ask

first request and just like completely

blank and then just this whole time he's

just kind of been staring out and just

drinking more than usual and is just

more mm-hmm

like since the storm like not a words

and peeped warned like Simon everyday no

lost later it's fine I think for the

first couple days Eva was probably kind

of like giggling tours all the time like

there was there is this sort of lasting

tingle that she sort of feels over those

days and it gradually goes away but it's

savored yeah but then I guess if if she

notices that paltin hasn't said a single

word mm-hmm she'll probably find time to

go sit next to him and be like I'm real

sorry about your mandolin

it's kind of Huff's just kind of sighs

like you know feel like you more than

anyone knows where that mandolin was

from I think you know that that was one

of the last things I had tying me to

where I came from and I didn't want that

to be who I was anymore

and it felt like I was ready to get rid

of the last reminiscing pains of my past

and embrace what felt like a new family

that I had and then when their god damn

stupidity and self-righteousness got in

the way it almost got us killed said

maybe I should just held on to that and

sold it when we got to where we're going

you know for once I was like like Gavin

haven't you know sacrificed anything and

I'm not one to you know throw my life

away but maybe this is it but apparently

not

because we still blew up half a city

killed god knows how many people so you

want to be sorry for the mandolin you're

wasting your time but if everyone I

don't know Lee says I don't know she

takes his hand and says no tell me it

wasn't about that about something that

now I'm not even sure if that's even the

right decision anymore what do you mean

I don't think a day goes by where I

think what the hell am I doing with

these lunatics

I have died more since knowing y'all and

yet I can't bring myself to leave and

that is infuriating because all my life

I've just done what I've can to get by

and now put myself in harm's way and the

fact that there's something I can't put

my finger on that makes me want to stick

around with something that's probably

gonna get me killed again it's just

against everything I've ever known

I don't know how to feel about it

well for what it's worth I'm glad you

haven't left yet

thanks dear

make a dirt perception I check oh no no

no one which is never fun 25 you hear a

strange humming and I'm out and it it

you sort of able to very quickly track

it to your keyring Oh God and as you as

you look at your keys have what you have

how many did you have at this point

mm-hmm including the one you got back

from the bomb right um it's fine uh I

want to see I have three three

altogether when you do a count you

realize you now have four no and just

can't be good

you see one of them has a strange symbol

a new one you haven't had before that

has appeared on the ring has a strange

symbol on part of it

it's a silvery key and the symbol looks

like a sort of crescent moon lying like

bowl shaped with a dot above it looks

like this

oh no and that's just on my key ring yes

I got one of those in the mail

oh no and that's I get we got a package

jarred which we were intending to send

to you but I got rebounded by the mail

service so it came up a letter and a key

that looks just like this I got one

it's a dearest sir madam if you are

reading this then you may yet prove

indispensable in a matter of the

greatest importance to my world let me

tell you a story once upon a time I

elminster sage of shadow Dale found

myself in possession of a magical

artifact that held within at the deepest

secrets of the Forgotten Realms now all

mages know that there is nothing quite

so powerful as knowledge and when

secrets fall into the wrong hands there

can be nothing quite so dangerous so

paramount was the need for the secrecy

that I dared not even refer to the stone

by name and so forbidden where its

contents where I did not that I did not

trust even one such as myself to keep it

safe from those who would use its

secrets for ill nor was there anywhere

in the Forgotten Realms I could hide the

artifact that was sure to remain safely

beyond my enemy's reach and when there

is no suitable hiding place to be found

anywhere in the realm and one must turn

his sights to realms beyond your

so-called well

enough of that secrets yet to be

revealed no stone unturned as they say

yours sincerely elminster Omar sage of

shadow Dale hashtag no stone unturned

[Laughter]

it's a USB key

I was dance isn't a USB key oh yeah

I wished my address was updated properly

yes Jared Jared's is but so yeah you

live locally you can come by I have some

books for you anyway you have to come by

what's on the key Jared that's Jared's

note not the S note Diaz just got a key

okay cool yeah can you use that one oh

of Court well no it looks completely

different from all my other yes imagine

key ring but other than that it does not

look like the other keys cool alright so
