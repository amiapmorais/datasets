[Music]

for each other so as Dungeon Master's we

have no idea what's actually happening

or what's in there so will we as far as

we understand will be going through like

a series of kind of individual scenarios

for each character separately dungeon

mastered and we'll just go from there so

thank you Chris for this opportunity so

we're actually gonna be starting off

with paltin what no Jared's envelope

says number one yeah am I not the

dungeon master

oh yes yes well I believe I'm gonna be

the master first for Nate I want to show

you look how cute this is it says our

names and and it has like wit directions

and then there's a little post-it note

that said from Christmas love we like to

believe Chris actually just has these

envelopes on his desk at all times any

times need to invite people for his

birthday parties or whatever this is

like one of 10 horrible what do I do to

them set pre-made yeah yeah Paulton

scenario open this envelope first I want

it can I hold - one touch it here okay I

like holding things Nate are you ready

it's so adorable

oh there's multiple here there's why he

drew a little wine

all right I don't think you guys

understand how wonderful oh it's like

not even oh yeah I'm so ready there's a

lot of text on there it's like a

choose-your-own-adventure

it's like if this happens reads this

part if this happens read this part this

is okay let's go all right there's also

like a really important at the top I

just had to read so that's all okay let

me and as I understand that the other

characters all get to play as well it's

just that this is like main character

paltin time yes it should be a lot of

role-playing okay Bolton you know

following a spectacular performance in

the market

you've become a water deep sensation

hell yeah

you've been entertaining for just

sold-out crowds in taverns all across

the city mm-hmm now your performances

have earned a staggering 300 gold pieces

so far it's not a lot for us okay and

Simon's gotten pretty good at providing

musical competent for you on a set of

wooden pipes oh my son now you've also

found yourself on the receiving end a

lot of free wine and attention and

you've been amassing a flock of devotees

who worship you I'm aware of all of this

yes so right now you and Simon are on

your way to perform a gig in the doc

ward and as you were approaching the doc

ward it's about early morning by 11 a.m.

or so so and you're getting towards the

ocean there's a lot of cool breeze

coming at you like you're feeling it

like you're very very fresh despite all

the wine you've had this morning it's

helping you kind of stay focused for the

show you're about to perform and as you

get towards the harbor deepwater Harbor

you see three massive ships three

galleries huh and as you're walking by

you actually can note the names of each

ship alongside the barge of each one one

is called the heartbreaker

one is called the Hellraiser and the

last least notable one is called the eye

catcher

hmmm now they're all outlandishly

decorated despite what I just said so

even like the eye catcher is of the

least notable still like pretty fanciful

like they probably might they might be

like sort of party boats rather than

like fishing vessels they mean anything

else okay so the first two ships are at

the docks they're there the heartbreaker

and the Hellraiser

are there the third one the eye catcher

is actually anchored in the middle of

the bay the sea Maine's fair a traveling

carnival has come to water deep and over

the next two days Simon has become

enthralled by this Cup carnival God so

all he wants to do is go to this watch

the circus performers see the caged

animals see all the decorations and just

he wants to party and just be at this

carnival as much as possible with his

dad

nice

and they're also rehearsing for a parade

that's also in there so you go there and

you perform another show goes extremely

well and you find yourself kind of

getting towards the evening of being in

the doc ward and I have to kind of

finish up the show with Simon earned

your gold pieces this is the kind of

time where you and Simon usually rewind

maybe get some wine mm-hm partake in the

different festivities okay so I I turn

to my son and I say Simon yeah so works

done for the day

their job what do you want - what do you

want to do now oh I'll go see the

animals okay over there any of me like

grabs you by the hand starts pulling you

like like you're already going in that

direction yeah and you actually make

your way through something somewhat of a

crowds not like massive like in the

markets by any means but enough that you

kind of have maneuver your way around

people it seems that not just you two

are also here enjoying the different

festivals our Strix and I there I'm

gonna say guess know based on later

notes no okay okay okay though I don't

know if we're allowed to but if other

NPCs arrives maybe I'll have you guys

hop in okay okay Chris did say that the

other characters were involved okay okay

whenever DM whenever you feel it let us

know I'm doing my best

[Laughter]

so Paul Simon brings you pulls you over

along the way actually you come across

like a imported wine stand from one of

the ships like they actually set up this

stall and they said these are wines from

I don't know flan in the desert they

call it the wine of radiance the wine of

what anyone yeah okay thank you thank

you wine of radiance oh okay yeah that

seems like a reference I don't get so

assignments pulling me along I'd just

immediately like something this

lightweight yeah alright your juice I

can't wait until I'm old enough to have

some you technically might be I'm not

really sure that's fine I'd like to

taste anyway alright well more for me

so is there there's someone running this

yeah anything cool alright yeah so not

gonna steal this one good morrow to you

sir turning around is a clearly a

half-elven man but despite having the

Elven blooded and he is surprisingly

gruff but also very very approachable

and willing to sell his wares yes sir

come on in we have this finest wines

throughout all of flan crushed within

their own fresh new vineyards they say

the proves of rains themselves grow the

plants from underneath

how very appealing is very tantalizing

um yeah yes so so what do we what it's

also where we go it's a selection or is

it there's something specifically you

recommend maybe something that would

work for someone of you know of

notoriety around these parts he goes Wow

atrium looked back at the stall and

there's just the Rose like imagine like

a wine rack it's just like rows of that

make a perception check first role yeah

I need to do it on there I will place it

please don't

13:13 okay so as you look to pick out a

specific bottle for you when you kind of

notice is that every single label is

exactly the same and he picks one out

from the top shelf this goes ah this is

what our finest selection for someone

such as yourself who Cooney has very a

dignified taste and that's why you put

them all with the same label just so

people don't get any ideas right we

don't want you know the lesser commoner

people to feel like they're being left

out which is why they're all exactly the

same it's for their sake I see and what

does this fine wine run me for good sir

he picks up the bottle on King and kind

of like flourish before he's like again

this is but the finest of wine for

something like this this has to be three

platinum he

mmm interesting

it's like Matt may I just look at it oh

of course it's kind of hmm I don't I

don't know if I could bring myself to

three platinum I'd say if you were

willing to bargain how about three gold

and the hearty handshake of one of

Waterdeep s-- most beloved performers

make a persuasion rule okay so so 19

that's good

so as you say that actually Cod dawns

upon him who exactly is he's talking to

and he goes I would be so adored if one

of my fine wines was was was endorsed by

mr. SEPA himself perhaps maybe at one of

your shows you could just have a bottle

on stage and people could just see the

labor ah product placement well I sort

of deal on our brand hmm right right

they should they should come up with

some sort of title for this type of

transaction but deal with a brand

[Laughter]

hmm it might just be crazy enough to

work what it works for me if it works

for you I will gladly part with this but

I'm your three gold pieces well I mean

well now that you've brought up

endorsement and brand deals at this

point money going to you for this type

of let's call it exposure that seems

one-sided oh right I'm new at this so

exposure probably is good enough

[Applause]

[Music]

and you just fancied the bottle of wine

yeah it's labeled wine of irradiance

very nice quick tour fee and it says yes

that would make me very happy just

please display the bottle is much do you

want and let people know if they wish to

this desire or more that they can find

plenty right here it's like we'll see

have a nice day and as you walk away

hear the faintest whisper of him going

[Applause]

alright well wine is attained

I just all right you're immediately

pleasantly surprised at how good this

line actually is best one you've ever

had

probably not but far better than you

were expecting considering the

salesperson himself

mm-hmm and as you continue to go through

and enjoy your different wines and the

festivities assignment for disappered a

few hours you also realize that the wine

you've been drinking is far more potent

than you realized

hey yeah like they're like hey alright

like this one bottle could probably do

it yes so you're drinking more mm-hmm oh

yes

Simon all right Simon Simon Simon listen

yeah

[Laughter]

you're doing you're doing a good job oh

thanks okay all right yet please carry

the plot the whole cult thing didn't

work out hmm so I was thinking instead

of a cult what if I just joined the

circus look how cool and neat everything

is I already think it seems really funny

probably go on a lot of adventures I

know how to play the bagpipes I could

probably make a lot of money it's the

all kinds of things dad I want to join

the circus well you do enable your son's

dreams mm when you say please let's

let's go watch some circus action first

and we'll really see how that goes okay

I mean that way you could see just how

cool it'd be and how excited would be

for me right yes let's go with that

okay and he grabs me by the hand again

and I'll follow you through he actually

brings you aboard one of the ships

themselves I will say this is on

Hellraiser sounds right

we're the main deck of the ship as I had

been converted to like a makeshift

circus tent more or less she brings up

their brings through the crowds and they

do different shows their knife juggling

there's a guy with a fire whip cleaving

it around and showing like how easily he

can control this fire without magic and

not affecting himself a lot of them just

like fire whip like a magical one but

like a whip you've lit on fire

no didn't so there's a lot of similar

acts of that sort it eat after each one

Simon is like see I could do stuff like

that yeah I could do all that it'd be

really cool yeah yeah you just what's

that over there and I'll turned I don't

know somewhere else and try and find

something less dangerous for him to be

anything you'd like to turn around his

point at someone giving up flowers yeah

see see look at this flower this give a

person that's lovely bringing joy and

sweet-smelling flowers I guess I could

do that too maybe maybe that's like a

nice way to kind of get started and then

maybe from there I could do even cooler

things yeah hey what cool things do you

want to do he points to the fire whip

you get it from me I saw that thing too

this is pretty neat we should maybe we

should just try and take that for

ourselves you know like steal it no it's

borrowing for an extended period of time

without explicit permission okay cool I

want to approach the firewood person no

son don't join the circus should it's

best with me no it's take the circus

with us home it's still fire whip on

there anywhere No did you have a plan of

obtaining said fire whip in the middle

of a crowd and all these people watching

or I'm going to walk through the crowd

and just kind of pardon part sorry sorry

you know you know mr. sepiol walking

through excuse me sorry sorry sorry that

yeah

even I'm doing now I'm just like oh my

gosh

every time I'm sorry I'm like hello

firewood person yes hello I see that you

have a whip of fire well it's several

normal lips ooh normal whips that I had

light on fire mmm however some say to

control such a whip is pretty magical

[Laughter]

[Music]

can I try he hands you like a regular

grip it's like this is a normal or

normal grip yes anyone can do one of

these I mean you should be around such a

large crowd soju you're doing it well I

am but the master of this weapon you

seemed to be but the beginner well yeah

plus 13 performance role persuasion 26 I

follow up I'm like I also got plus 13

persuasion so could you sign it for me

when you're done yeah sure so the whip

has actually already been not doused and

they're some kind of liquid it might be

oil or something of that nature and he

actually just hand you a a tinder stick

it's like a match right it just says

yeah this is all you need to turn into a

fire with oh my god tinder match I just

now got that

I say to him it's a very puzzled look on

his face

after handing you the supplies you just

see Simon going wait your turn your turn

and I try to like see how I sure man

yeah do it

when my my performing will do it will do

a disadvantage I want you to do a

performance check out disadvantage

[Laughter]

because I believe it is a exotic weapon

it is told I could ask people to be

escorted out I can find out you know if

you break the fourth wall so convinced

it's a two way breaking that's true okay

so it performs a disadvantage right this

is a fault and SEPA dice and depending

on how you roll okay that one I might

have you do an additional one good it

depends how you roll go ahead okay so

the first one is a twenty nine okay the

lower one is a twenty four so sure

enough you're able to do a lot of

flourishes with this whip in fact a lot

of ones that the crowd hadn't seen

before because they aren't actual whip

techniques you're just waving it around

so yeah you manage to kind of get the

attention of a lot of people I'm really

like look I can do again you just see

Simon office I going was like Simon

you're very small and it can be very

dangerous so please be careful

right away Simon takes that whip and

starts whipping it around and can I

borrow d20 huh No

so let's take it the little white one I

wanted to have show up so I'll have

Simon performed with the whip Oh

surprisingly good it's a sixteen so he

manages to not hit anyone it's not

really a performance or anything

impressive but he he it's like having a

jump rope like on both ends just is just

playing with it yeah it doesn't matter

injure himself or anyone else but he

certainly has a really good time and

Suzie he's done with that he looks back

up and yours is like yeah that's it I

want to join the circus please dad can I

sure

[Laughter]

I love how that was the deciding factor

for the next envelope ah Chris Perkins

[Music]

[Applause]

okay all right we're just gonna have the

next morning sign prepares a small

bundle of rations and personal effects

and then embarks on his quest to join

the seed maidens fair to Circus I didn't

say you can go without me

is he going without me you probably

passed out you were drunk yes and

actually this is a really important

notice here it's like when paltin is

drunk it actually says that

[Laughter]

do have a problem first step is

recognition so yeah he would barks on

his question during the sea maidens fair

and he's welcomed into the carnival no

questions asked and becomes a carnie

what the end he's placed in charge of

cleaning the beasts pens

okay not the fun filled role he was

hoping for but he's still a part of it

be good to teach him how to do some hard

labor yeah yeah a few days after that

what no what you tell the evil one about

where their son went what does he tell

you one go ahead where's our son today

oh now see the circus yes not be going

this well why would you join the circus

that would be dangerous and silly and we

have so many other things to do and no

of course we wouldn't join the circus

yeah now what what

now we have a lot of things to do but we

are all of us the kids well I mean

waffle schedule seemed pretty open I

mean yeah that's why he went to go see

the circus but I see no parent would let

their foul join the circus that would be

just ridiculous and and poor parenting

and that's why I think that it's good to

try and become trendsetters and not

follow as parents our son joined the

circus yes then it was kind of a coin

toss I'm sure he's fine but do I know a

sign yeah he's fine I would contradict

you but I realized that I spent the

entirety of that one time we were

sitting in front of the fireplace

telling you that children should be

allowed to do what they think is most

right for them myself into a character

quandary because she's acknowledged that

the subreddit can't bring that back on

yeah hungry do we have food

evylyn spends the next couple days just

kind of like she's going along her

normal things but she's notably like way

more preoccupied than usual sure mm-hmm

so when those few days pass again

probably about surprisingly early in the

morning like right the start of the day

evens been up for quite some time as she

usually is but for districts paulten

they're probably just starting to kind

of rise out of beds or really that early

morning back at the Waffle House Manor

Simon comes home got all this stuff with

them and count looks a little

downtrodden

well frustrated hey how'd it go

sucked did you learn something

yeah it's hard work and I don't like it

see see I'm preparing you for the real

life well thanks for the nice tea geez

dad yeah no sweat now wait I had

something yeah and he just talks about

how all he had to do was just take care

of the Beast and shovel dung left and

right and wasn't nearly as fun as

exciting as he was hoping it would be

like all the fantastical acts that he

saw back at the actual fair oh did I get

to keep the whip no whip no I was asking

I was asking the DM not not you I mean

it seems like the fourth wall is broken

and everything just flies every single

direction these days that's fair

I'm gonna say no he wants his whip back

because it's his performing tools oh you

can't have everything I'll be back so

the day after Simon's return there is

actually a knock at the Manor and

someone asking for palton Zepa guitars

for you can I retro actively ask the

question about the whipped guy sure

could I have tried could i if when when

I'm not giving the whip could I've tried

to yank a few matches sure man all right

I'll do a sleight of hand

yeah check versus his perception to see

if you notice I'm trying to take a

couple of matches that would be a 22

yeah so you manage to be like oh yeah

sure here you go and you swipe up will

say you get to tender sticks okay

why

we have enough fire I have a plan

okay so were you answering the door dual

restricts has this been established a

way of a peephole we don't I don't think

we're too stupid for that yeah we

usually leave the door open

yeah we don't even lock it so is this

where we train train no it's not okay

who's answering the door I answered it

and said it was for him

okay so palton when you come down you

actually see a very familiar looking man

there you believe you've seen him back

at the yawning portal

he was once playing a lute they only had

a certain amount of strings on it and

you took it so do I like see him as I'm

coming down the stairs or am i full on

like in view or can I like sneak a peek

who it is first I imagine you probably

just casually watch it downstairs and

then you saw humming - did a little it's

like you

like yes I and you yeah I and you if

it's not too much trouble I would like a

private conversation with you yes if I

may use the facilities really quick I

will be right down here have it have a

seat in the living room right right

living room

have a seat make yourselves he comes in

and takes a seat and just goes is that

pie yes we have the finest pie it's not

a living room it's a working

establishment in our living

establishment she just like runs off and

started a fight which it's like what

kind you want we really just have mostly

crickets today but I'm really hoping to

make some more later what were you doing

so so just preemptively yeah I take the

wine bottle I had I'm just gonna like

take out the cork and then just like put

a little rag in the top of it and then

just kind of tuck that away next to a

little tinder matches why would Chris do

this it's like all right thing yeah so

if you recall you still have this loot

mmm that with three strings on it I

don't think I have that loot I'm pretty

sure you do yeah it's somewhere you

everything I forgot I've been actively

usually sure I don't have that loose

I just you saying it to the man

yes okay Strix just watch mine and he

just goes no matter allow me to properly

introduce myself my name is Matt Rome

and yes match from and that writes like

and I he actually leans and kind of

closer to you it says are you familiar

with the harbor's so what there's

there's not there's not a lot of like

like the you know floor sound so it's

kind of hard to hear Harper's Harper's

hearth all the Harper's I should be my

you've met the Harper's several time

which ones were they I'm bad with names

Harper's were sort of like a secret

agent kind of force within water deep ah

our birds some time ago you had met one

in the tavern with hand-drew and he was

speaking to you I came for his name son

dalla was connected to dollar was a

Harper cake boat dragon deal mmm-hmm you

would think they were meddlers mmm yeah

yes I know a thing or two about accident

well you should know that loot that you

stole from me is actually a magical

listening device

[Laughter]

hot night allows me to hear certain

things and if I may I would ask to like

I would like to ask your boy Simon a few

questions about his time in the carnival

who sign Simon the one with the sassy

mouth constricts like here this like

she's probably bringing a pie at this

point yeah you probably hearing enough

yeah she's hearing enough and she's just

like hearing that and she's just like

saying I think someone wants you

Oh Simon yes you hear a loud we don't

know where that is okay

Simon comes downstairs and he's holding

the loo and what and watch out those how

wonderful what a good boy and you see

matram just calmly retrieve it and looks

over at Simon and just as sweet boy I

know about you had your time within the

carnival I would like to ask you a few

questions

surely you weren't just cleaning the

beach pens what else did you see there

the Simon thinks for a moment and says

ah I see much for the most part I was

below decks and the heartbreaker

cleaning up animal poop oh but all the

humans who were there spoke in a really

weird language a weird language you're

certain oh yeah I've never heard that

before

and then Simon also says oh yeah and in

one of the cages was an owl bear and

that's where that one stops yeah who's

next I think - yeah oh I get to be

deemed by Nate

for the record there was Simon joins the

circus and Simon doesn't does by the way

everyone has pies now cool Oh Strix is

like the most nosy like restaurant

worker well magic coming off of it

I think you start with a read this one

first

goodnight there's actually a period to

it oh and it's read this one first

period mine is green too

[Music]

oh okay

so there's hope cool

[Music]

he just crumpled he just crumpled it up

okay okay it's hard it's precious

clearly thinks we're smooth smarter than

we actually are

I had that moment when we sat down on

stage where he was like Oh Chris asked

us all to do like in Chris Perkins place

with no information and no preparation

beforehand course he knew he knew that

we would just go off the rails I mean

what else are we gonna do actually be

functional also now palton has a bomb

has two matches he could make a bomb

whenever he wants all right I'm ready

I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready

okay strict's that's my name you find

yourself in burrows face light up you're

at the Waffle House okay going about

your business on your pies here making

that good biz mm-hmm but you see that

over the past few days or so waffles

has become temperamental oh no and

difficult to control Oh No one day when

you're baking your your pies you hear

just loud thudding coming from coming

from upstairs uh-huh well I'm of course

I'm sure there's some customers down

there and I'm like that's normal it's

fine I just like shuffle upstairs but he

just keeps getting louder as you're just

like ah that's fine just here oh you

know I must be evil in doing yoga

[Laughter]

so I'll just run up with my staff and

just like so ruffles is just like

ramming rentier head into the wall

repeatedly and just like scratching

holes in the paint

girl it's okay it's okay I get all

Turner into mist which is what I usually

do well before that has you approached

her she actually takes a biter huh and

she tears a hole in your robe that's

okay but she did take a swipe and you

managed to just I'm offended I'm just

like you know and like your cat does it

and you're just like hmm I can't believe

I thought we had a choice I'm like

what's wrong waffles and I just like you

know what's wrong what do you want it

doesn't seem to be replying coherently

it's still like thrashing about just

raging go outside what I do usually is

turn her into mist okay put her in a

bottle okay so I'll turn into mist

that's how we take her for walks well I

did her in the bottle then take her

outside

okay it's all funny turn to miss put her

in the bottle okay you can go outside

man I go outside and I think we do have

a back yard okay and I'll just like open

the bottle and let her not be like here

you know I mean like I don't there's

like probably like a leather ball or

something she plays with outside

exercise and is really big and things

like that

you let her you let her out of the

bottle and then she just kind of starts

like angrily digging just like all right

like not and not in one specific place

she's just like tearing up the yard all

of our very hard-working

landscape well I don't think

good landscaping I would like to well

that wasn't my job evil and clearly

hired someone to make them just like

right I'm like I'm just gonna watch her

like I mean you can do whatever you want

waffles is I mean I don't know where

you're going you want to go someplace

underground you want to go to the

underdog ooh spooky

as you're trying to talk waffles down

you here by your feet squidly says mom

what's going on

I'm not your mom waffles is clearly

upset I don't know why she's digging in

the dirt and I'm pretty sure that all of

the customers think that I said we have

a prisoner tied up upstairs who's trying

to escape oh well

Jenks likes al bears maybe maybe James

can help that's true

cool Jenks come here come on I need to

save this helping thanks immediately

like it's almost like he just appears

like he's just so quickly like you might

have just been in the bushes outside

he's right there and he's just like

what's wrong with waffles before anyone

can answer

waffles just snatches Ferdinand oh oh

and then just like when a dog just

aggressively gets a new toy just cool

just flinging it back and forth it's it

seems just ripping at the arms at the

legs at the waist and just stuffing is

flying everywhere

jinkx is just I like tears it's my own

fate I'll fix it again it's fine I fixed

it like five times already it's okay

waffle starts eating it I'll make you a

new one it's fine it'll pass it's fine

I can make you a new one even probably

be really creepy I'm sorry but that's

all I know how to do I'll make you a new

one and change his legs decide

[Music]

I'm like why would you do that waffles

we had a truce and no eating the

children or their things well this kind

of this kind of attitude and behavior

continues for another couple of days

can I incite check waffles like why is

she doing this like can i research this

like sure okay insider animal animal II

it probably be animal handling which is

well technically she's not an animal

because I can't talk to her speaker oh

that's right I don't have any monster

hand you cannot she's more sentient you

can you can insult glare at me I don't

know anything okay great it's a three

okay good you don't know anything I

don't know anything and I'm just like

stop it I just keep giving her cheese or

something like you want some cheese now

she's angry and farting farts the

customers were leaving I'm like I don't

know what to do she's mad and now Jake's

is probably still crying so strict's

will make jinx a new owl bear stuffed

animal and it's just horrific good

squidly loves it I'm sure he does he

tries to take it for himself he just

so so a few days go by and it's brought

to your attention that a seafaring

carnival called

the sea maidens fair has arrived in

water deep I hate where this is going

I know where this I'm upset and you

think maybe it'd be nice to take a walk

and bring waffles to get some fresh air

go down to the dock ward and see the

carnival

yeah I hear there's a guy there with a

fire whip yeah do I get to take everyone

with me oars and by myself I'm gonna say

by yourself okay

so you hear me like might go out leave

out the house and you just hear strikes

yeah I'm gonna make waffles for a walk

by myself it's probably dangerous but

you know I buy and hear the door slam

even's busy doing thunder yoga upstairs

like thunder Lysander yogurt yoga so

yeah so I will put in waffles harness

longings I like to imagine that waffles

has a little harness that's actually

like really frilly and cute oh she's got

like a little like pink frill collar oh

yeah yeah walk her down the street me

like my marbles we're gonna go to the

circus or something I don't know but

don't eat anyone there don't waffle you

travel to the dark the doc ward where

you see two galleons tied off and the

third is ankle or ankled anchored in the

middle of the harbor

you see bunch of a bunch of Carnival

folks you know busy assembling all their

floats getting the docks ready getting

the show ready to start to bring in all

the happy families and the people to

have a good time I hate it yeah yeah you

would hate it while you're walking

around you see a few of them are

bringing very large cages with various

beasts in them loading them on to

ships and that is what you see okay

would you like to do anything there I

mean yeah if there's like animals I'm

gonna it's like it's like you're at the

dog park I'm gonna go let waffles meet

all the other animals we're like look at

this time there's there's like a

displacer beast and like I don't know

what's there please don't let it be a

displays a reason but I'll like let her

sniff everything d'Alene what you got on

the house or at the carnival like I

don't know this is that's this is a

little scary but you know I'm by myself

I went out here I'm you know I was told

to get out the house more doesn't you

know be more independent nice so as

you're doing that one of them one of the

carnival folk a beast handler hmm

approaches you with with waffles says

yeah fine-lookin al-bari got there yes

she is she is a fine looking owl where

I've got here yeah that takes this takes

another like bite out of here out of

your robe just like tears another thing

and just starts waving it around yes yes

that happened a lot as of right now it

is I'm just trying to get her to meet

new people I'm thinking maybe she just

needs friends or maybe she needs more

pastry she pretty much all need pies

which i think is a really bad idea so

maybe she just needs to like eat one of

the people that works here

[Laughter]

[Applause]

looks kind of looks over waffles just

kind of like watching watching the mood

and watching the aggression and like the

frustration like taking like swipes and

bicep evil and just like just be a good

girl be Sandler says like nah that ain't

that ain't diet I know what that is what

is it it's a strange beast handler I

think you're I think you're out there's

a time to have herself a little baby

strikes just like he's like oh I hope

that doesn't mean we have to eat her too

[Applause]

[Laughter]

does not hear that she's like wow

there's no other al bears around water

deep so I don't know what to do for her

because if she would like to do that it

is her choice but I try not to pressure

others into that sort of thing at the

exact time you mentioned at the lack of

al bears in water deep one of the cages

being dragged by has within it

[Music]

well maybe you feel about this situation

I don't want to force you in anything

and I'm like watching her to see how she

reacts to the male out there she's just

like as you decide I need to I'm gonna

keep an eye see how she reacts you can

see waffles is in front of the cage

trying to back into it

I hurt my eyes and I'm like oh dear

ritual of the Oliveri

working good old throat Ripper in there

marked this panel mature waffles needs a

friend but she's come home I mean she

can hang out with wrote River for a

while and and do whatever she wants to

do and she like thanks for a second

she's like what's she gonna do but I we

need her back is what I'm saying oh so

you want them to have a little playdate

there yeah maybe you know play with the

ball and like you know like cuddle and

[Laughter]

how much role-playing is gonna be

involved

[Laughter]

what's tricks in this scenario that

involves like the birds and the bees the

bees handlers of the seed maidens fair

arrange for waffles and throat Ripper to

meet in the hold of the heartbreaker one

of the docked carnival ships Strix

rushers waffles onto the ship and almost

immediately

waffles catches a whiff of something

that Pete's her interest Oh waffles

their pies I mean to an extent when the

two

when the two Albers finally meet

everything goes into soft-focus

heart filter know when they when they

finally meet they start fighting and a

lot of effort can separate them after

tiring each other out they become a

couple and begin to adjust to each

other's presence is that how is that how

that happens it's like I don't know I've

never actually gotten this far watching

this happen so it's all new new to me -

Strix and the beasts handlers watch with

anticipation as the two al bears become

more familiar with one another it's a

long boring wait that stretches through

the night and well into the next day is

this them not talking about their

feeling it looks like it mm-hmm

am I just sitting I'm just I don't come

home I'm just sitting like whose full

thing like like just there's like gears

going like is this how this happened

waffles bats throat Ripper away every

time he tries to mount her I'm just like

waffles doesn't need someone to ride I

mean she just walks on her own

[Applause]

- no one know Chris is like I'm not

gonna go but watch what I'll make them

say speaking speaking of would you mind

reading from eventually

eventually she acquiesce and the owl

bears in all caps get it off

[Applause]

brown chicken brown cow older Strix has

never heard anything so loud and

terrible in her life and she must avert

her eyes and cover her ears I'm doing

that already how did he know when all is

said and done throat ripper calmly

allows himself to be taken back to his

pen waffles is hoisted up out of the

hold follow Strix home and sleep soundly

in her room Strix comes back with like

like like a like she's just seen the

dead like strength is like double Strix

like itching yourself like there was

something and she like tries to explain

it to everyone in the house like I don't

know and like no one can even answer it

because it's so awkward that she's just

talking about it mm-hmm sounds like you

had fun at the circus someone did

and when you wake up the next day waffle

seems to be back to her normal self is

she pregnant only time will tell I don't

know what's tricks also doesn't tell

anyone what happened she just said that

she had a nice fight and she feels

better

all right like a really close fight like

like they rub their bits together that's

how they have Chloe cos just what

nothing I'm just thinking too much about

this all right I'm deeming Jarrod Brandi

that's what Chris thinks the keys look

like now you know this is the official

canonical key whoa

talk amongst yourselves about Albert

meeting loser before whatever it is that

this is happening I'm sure death is in

his room writing all kinds of different

plans down on how exactly he's going to

manage what is it like ten different

factions now we're all trying to vie for

his assistance in getting the dragon

horde mmm relax all gasp lanters himself

at minimum I'm pretty sure there's more

than that command soon man soon yeah oh

yeah that guy yeah chicken for a while

nice 45 minutes Lera

so death is just like having a yes how

can I pick them all against each other

in between strikes is like I don't know

what this is

what's the river the owl berries were

just there rubbing their bits are they

fighting

thanks for the bits MIDI F has been

especially stressed after especially

after dural axes recent murder yeah

which he just cleaned up and left yeah

that's cool cool well

as DF is perusing the evidence trying to

figure out this it's been like a couple

days he's been kind of obsessing about

this he's really been kind of a recluse

feeling guilty about the murder even

though he had nothing to do with it he's

been moping about the house and

murmuring things about being a captain

and you know all that kind of stuff and

there's a knock at the door even answers

of this usual yeah this for you dammit

he puts down his quill and sits up

scoots his chair in and comes down out

of his room slash office and goes to the

front door you see a human smartly

dressed stands at attention captain I am

sergeant Alice Keller Donna of the city

watch pleased to make your acquaintance

oh yes hello should you step in I would

be most obliged thank you she steps in

very rigid kind of marches stands in the

middle of the room didn't doesn't turn

around or anything just stands there at

attention as if she's waiting for you to

say something if they won't apply oh did

you want a pie I would love a pie thank

you sir this is all very foreign to Diaz

like what's happening here captain I

have come with a very special request

from the city watch I have been asked to

help ask to ask you to help solve a

murder

here's your pie definitely wasn't us

last night she takes it what kind of pie

is it all the saints uh true yeah it's

not gonna fruits like boysenberry hand

with your permission sir oh yeah go

ahead it's a hand pies

she was forgets oh yeah this is

delicious pie tell me more about this

Merc yes she'd touched the rest away yes

the it was a Roland's 'var I don't know

if you're familiar an elf who served as

a courier for the ambassador of silvery

moon we're facing some diplomatic

pressure to solve the murder very

quickly and we know that you're good at

such mysteries yeah thanks to himself

for a moment am i but on his face he's

like she again doesn't offer any she

just says these things and then looks at

you expectantly okay tell me everything

you know let's see well this is the the

second murdered elf in as many weeks and

let's see the first victim was a female

moon elf named salah el Damir who sold

wine in the market I think it was a

elven quest wine are you much of a

connoisseur I'm not but I have good

contacts through very nice good

mouthfeel very well the thing was that

they were both killed in a similar

fashion and Rolen was cut to pieces by

slashing weapons at one or more not even

the same it seemed to be multiple

slashing weapons and I you know as the

one who suggested that you might be the

man for the job I certainly hope that

you know that you might might strike up

some some teamwork here as we try to

figure it out I might be able to where

were the murders taking place you know

it's kind of above my my pay grade to

know but if if you and I were to team up

I'm sure we could find out I'm sure that

they would give you that kind of infamy

well if I were to work

someone like you know not like not like

I'm looking for like a promotion or like

you know I would like to give a quick

scan over this woman and her uniform to

make sure that it's real give a

perception okay

perception it's my perception is pretty

good that's a 27 you you take in every

detail of her uniform and as far as you

can tell it looks 100% legit very

well-kept you get the sense that this is

someone who cares like they they're like

try hard like you've seen Todd's uniform

and table uniform looks fine you know

it's all regulation but sometimes

there's afraid yes smudge there hers is

meticulous she's like try hard city

watch okay and assistance in this

investigation it would it be with you

are on my own or oh I wouldn't come ask

for your help if I wasn't willing to

stand by your side thick and thin

whatever you need anything at all well I

can do my best to provide better insight

I can and whatever information I can

glean from the situation's solving the

murder itself yeah you know who knows

but I can at least provide as much

assistance as I can well can you take me

to the crime scenes or the body so

you're you're willing to help yes well

look at that as long as you have a bunch

of em oh what's the other one now well

the other one was the first one this one

was just a normal key okay you'll I

picked the skull key mm-hmm as long as

this doesn't take like more than a day

hmm

Diaz and Alice forge a closer close

friendship during the investigation

we're not chasing down leads and

questioning suspects they spend long

nights exchanging theories over

non-alcoholic drinks

yes one of these let's see one of these

nights they're out having drinks and do

you it finds himself drawn to Alice not

for any reason other than that

she seems steadfast in her dedication to

duty and desire for justice it's like

very easy to figure out what she wants

it's you know duty to the city watch

justice for wrongdoers and you know

they're sitting there talking over over

this and having drinks and Alice says

you know the people of Waterdeep should

be able to sleep soundly knowing that

the city watch is watching out for them

cheers this Cheers with you I agree I'm

glad that we're glad that we're working

on this together let's let's collect

what we know so beyond their elven

heritage the victims have two things in

common right yes found that they were

both killed on overcast nights mm-hmm

and their purse strings were cut let's

see I mean there's no way to know who

robbed them whether it was the killer or

someone else but I mean or even if the

person themselves being cut is even

related to the crime why do you both and

I mean cutting of victims coin purse

strings pales in comparison to the the

violence of the attacks I mean those

were up-close and personal attacks

flashing and yeah I mean like you said I

think that we have to conclude that the

killer is probably a drow who is

murdering the elves out of pure malice

whoa

I mean I don't see why we need to

immediately peg a drow well I don't know

why you said that either but it's on the

paper and based on the conclusion elves

you know I I passed on that information

to the city watch and they've they put a

bulletin out to warn elves to travel in

groups at night and all night time watch

patrols have been assigned a constable

with dark vision as well of it as well

as a wizard of watchful order who can

dispel magic it's dark out there man

dark metaphorically and also literally

yeah I follow I follow you know yeah and

as long as the city watch can provide at

least better-suited protection at night

I wish I had a better way of connecting

the two murders so if we can predict a

potential third victim you can set up

like a sting or something

a sting a sting yeah like an ambush of

sorts like if we know there's a third

target and if a coming for them we can

have additional city watch on hand or

hidden and be able to prevent the murder

and find whoever is doing this at the

time that's a good idea where would we

start have you ever done a sting before

[Music]

yeah of course of course I shouldn't

have underestimated you of course of

course you would have done I see I mean

so if I just how you do it well after

identifying or who a potential third

target could be or even possibly setting

up someone to attentionally be the third

target they would have to be somewhere

near the previous murders since we know

their operating area and then leading

down to somewhere where they only have a

singular means of escape perhaps the

dead end of an alleyway open streets too

many locations for them to run off to so

once they get to the end of that

alleyway and

should they attempt to murder or Bertil

that's when the hidden city watch

already placed there or following behind

can jump him prevent the escape and

apprehend him all right so we're we're

probably gonna need a few extra hands

right we can't do it all on our own it

would be less suspicious if it was non

city watch garbed people that makes

sense yeah I mean we're all the City

Guard that anyone could need together

you and I as a team her name Todd sure

man I mean sure I mean I have my own

duties so I don't know how much I'll be

able to directly assist in the sting

well I can't do it on my own

I mean you're gonna abandon me now after

all this I'm not abandoning you I'll

give you information and assistance I'm

not gonna do everything for you

I just I thought that we were a team I

don't know I mean I had an idea of where

we could set things up there's this

place in the doc ward where we can set

up the sting and you you have friends

that don't wear city watch Rose if you

wanted to bring them along I I can find

you know I can find some elves who are

willing to be bait you know maybe some

actors with with good like oh I'm

helpless elf I know in this alley like

like Tia said all right we're in the doc

ward

all right I'll meet you at skull Street

yeah yeah yeah off the water yes right

I'll I'll go grab some elves you bring

your friends and we'll get set up you

know right as the Sun Goes Down stake

things out do any of your friends have

dark vision or what okay great yeah well

it's just me I'll see you there

she offers you the secret handshake that

she showed you that you guys have but

roll me a performance check to see if

you remember it I was gonna say how well

am I gonna do this handshake 10 you you

kind of like do that thing where

someone's like and you offer the same

hand so it's kind of like yeah what I do

it but like just like a half second

delay from what we're doing is I watch

her she kind of copy it exactly yeah she

seems satisfied enough she go through

her way to to get the help she's gonna

meet you at skull skull Street alley

great I would like to go find evylyn

palton restrict all right hey guys will

help me stop a murder no way to cause

those No

sorry who's I don't know there's like a

serial killer of sorts go around killing

moon elves and stealing their money and

I was asked by the city watch to assist

in this and I can't do it on my own

it should be really really simple we're

setting up a very easy ambush point all

of you guys are more than capable of

taking down a singular person and a lot

of you will probably more be more

capable at this tonight so um was what's

the day rate for this what's your normal

rate mmm

how much do I normally pay you I don't

know how much are you willing to pay me

I got a bag of gems I'll give you a

couple sure I think we should all go

this sounds like fun let's go right now

because I just realized there's only a

few minutes left in this okay really 45

minutes oh that's right you have plenty

of time just kidding let's go up later

yeah strike she's already there just

like holding her salary right yeah I

mean between we can use Bolton's

invisibility strictiy of dark vision

ability better than any of us plenty of

fire and even the strongest person I

know so between all of that and if they

get too far away I'll be able to outpace

on so who are we looking for we don't

know exactly

it's more or less protecting someone it

was more or less gonna be a trap for

them so when they show up in and try to

steal or murder from this person we can

stop them so we're gonna keep an eye out

a trap

yes yeah we'll be easy

cool well I mean I can just see if

they're evil and if they're evil then

great if they're bad you start them on

fire yeah fire yeah the thing you do

you know Rick are we being made honorary

city watch members yes this official

city watch business and I'm bringing you

all on his deputies to help me out

deputy Martha thing that's me so then

are we any watch are we like that from

then on permanent deputies or does this

one job just qualify us to like register

as deputies I'll have to ask my manager

okay cool I just want to get I just want

to make sure like the whole like Union

situation sorted out with like the water

deep long yeah I don't want to be part

of the city watch can I just help yeah

so if she helps but declines the deputy

consultant no yeah we'll talk about it

on the way all right all right

the crew sets out to skull Street alley

you find Alice there and we're already

going well are we already going he said

we'll talk on the way yeah okay so we're

on the way all right so what's the

deputies

do we get dental and that's what the

montage scene is a montage of discussion

about 401k you you find Alice and two

elf actors they seem really excited for

the part they're you know they're

running lines with each other they're

practicing scared looks and like a few

stunts like falling to the ground and

things like that they seem really

enjoyed she's coaching them seems like

they might be friends but as soon as she

sees you she immediately like slow-mo

turns face lights up so warm moonlit

night and everyone can see how pleased

she is to see dia and strikes is like

I'm also like she walks up to him rigid

as usual and Captain Woodrow I was to

see you sir I've brought the assistants

to set this up

the contractors yeah this would be no

problem here - I don't have any Vista

well captain where would you like to to

lay in wait

evylyn up on the rooftops using our

flying boots able to merely get down for

some reason they're able to fly you'll

be able to pursuit shiny girl up got it

yep strict you're gonna be out closest

to the alley with your dark vision

you're gonna be able to see more than

anything more than any of us yeah and

once you see something using your dark

vision you'll be able to signal the rest

of us to get ready what's the signal do

three sparks off your thumb I can't do

that signal I'm not really good at a

precision hmm

three sparks somewhere okay all right

Bolton yo you'll be close from the

middle of Daly if you could make

yourself invisible say when well soon

what's it dark enough I'll be ready

right so when they show up they won't

even see you coming you'll be easily be

able to jump on them right I so will

duck

that garbage can oh no that's just me

sorry

well it makes sense that I would I would

hide with you as we're a we're a team

and we needed weight is so hiding yes

rooftop yep

also hiding hiding I mean I'm just

standing here but I blend in go for it

you're invisible things still hurt the

moment things go down the first thing

you can do is get the attackers off of

these two using your Thunder wave or

perhaps your charms anything like you're

gonna be the first person they would be

able to separate them and get this

danger out of the way got it

I think strikes is gonna hide by Diaz do

well mmm-hmm I was i I asked my friend

who's a wizard to come because you know

we were we wanted to make sure we had

some some magical support especially

hello magic we got magical support yeah

we have a ton of magical here too yeah

if anything like tell them ago because

they probably have like a two hour

minimum and you can just like write that

off the budget Fiona I mean can you

dispel magic yeah he can wait can i yes

it's very important that we have that

you know cuz if someone comes with some

sort of magical protection I mean I I

can I can I can unmagic their magic kite

insight check her sure I think what is

going on here this is weird this this

person is incomprehensible to you yeah I

don't know what she's doing and she I'm

just gonna be like look Magic's pretty

much the only thing we got so if you

want to bring more like you know like

it's aside from evil and if you do if

you want to bring more like hitting

power that that could work but magic

like we're good this is a precision job

City Watch doesn't just blunt force

punch things like a suggestion I'm gonna

be like you're gonna let us use our

magic and not bring extra I'm gonna let

you use magic

we got it right Bolton and if we need to

dispelling any magical disguises or

protection they have will be very

important you got it

everyone's lying in wait the elves are

standing in the alley they've worked out

some weird like romance drama that they

they will play through it takes about 15

minutes and then they kind of look

around you know see anyone so they start

it over and they're playing kind of the

same like lovers quarrel that ends in a

makeout scene like every 15 minutes

this goes on for quite some time

Britney's awkwardly like sitting next to

these suitors like eating a pie like wow

[Music]

Alice keeps trying to kind of like nudge

her way in between Strix and Diaz and

like talk about city watch things and

you know she it's very awkward cuz

you're all trying to hide behind this

trash can apparently no one's really

hiding but you do your best it's like

stop it's it's a couple hours of the

same love scene over and over again and

just when you feel yourself starting to

be like I cannot watch this oh I've seen

this one yeah one more time

you see a flicker in the darkness almost

like a flash of a cloak coming around

the corner of the alley Strix is like

wait wait wait whoa that's not this big

unless you actually say that out loud

uh-huh does she actually say that out

loud we won't she's already forgotten

what the signal

sorry already I'm like with a stealth

mission to go well once so like like

before me jumping in I'm just kind of

with everybody else until I'm gonna like

get in there right yeah you're nearby us

okay so like over here hiding behind a

trash can you're like in the alleyway

nearby so I'm gonna hold on she also

throws off some sparks while yelling we

will you've got as soon as a weeaboo

goes off in a cast once I pull it up

here this actually would happen like

reactionary I just you know need to make

sure that where is it well as soon as we

woo happens and the sparks go off you

see kind of almost like a strobe effect

you see this drow who had just come into

the alleyway so they're a few you steps

into the alley

and they're they're kind of you know

frozen and you see them flicker in the

light and then you see them cast magical

darkness and everything just goes darker

counterspell yeah you can do that halten

cast counter spell yep what does it look

like and sound like so basic it's really

exciting they go and nothing happens

that's about it the drow

they then they pull out this horn from

there their cloak and they're just

panicking and you see them just kind of

like strike a tinder match and light it

and from from what you can tell I see

the match and I reach I'm just like

seems to look right at you as they

strike this match I strike mine

[Applause]

yes from your careful you know you know

you like to keep very careful tabs on

what's in the house you've looked at a

lot of Warrington stuff his guns and

everything you see this horn and you

recognize that this is probably smoke

powder and they're they're about to

light it

well I recognize that's a gun it's not a

gun it's a horn of smoke pot you know I

do in action before the heave is able to

light that this thing's already lit I'm

Sam

you lit the Molotov cocktail well I mean

the rag is now on fire all right sure so

that's actually roll initiative oh you

won't need dice oh all right what's

yours 21 okay

mine's a six nineteen for the record I

asked Chris before the show if we will

need like a monster manual or DM

guidance think that well just to have it

on hand he goes oh no you really

shouldn't need any dice rolling stats

for that all right you go first dear all

right so the first thing I want to do is

actually throw a dagger to knock that

horn out of his hand

okay roll and I'll do it with moon

splinter all right

roll for that I borrowed from your

whitey 20 again yes I let's do uh just

arrange attack against that to try to

knock it out of his hand thank you

looking back my character sheet that is

a 22 you knock the smoke powder are

those yeah the Hornets smoke right out

of his hand no and he's got the lit

match yeah all right paulten look I mean

I wouldn't have you roll but like here's

the alley here's the drought here's you

you have a little atop cocktail roll

roll with an improvised weapon I guess

but it's not going to be hard okay so

let me add anything dexterity or

strength oh yeah it will go Dex then

okay okay fine no hold on okay 23 you

you eat them all till it lands between

the feet of the the drow who has just

dropped this

and you see for just a moment the match

held in front of their face and they

look up and go and the Molotov ignites

the smoke powder there's a giant

explosion it's more like spontaneous

human combustion or spontaneous drought

combustion just let up there was fire

where this person was and then they're

just all it wasn't me this time it's a

it's a it's a pile of ash and Strix

didn't even get to do any fire fall

stand just like I just slowly turned

back to Alice we got them

you have this is so hard I have to be

sober she says you have interesting

friends you guys search the the remains

of these ashes you find something again

you really watch what these guns look

like that works and as you find a what

you identified as a flintlock pistol as

well as some some bullets which seem to

kind of be damaged by the explosion but

you know that they are can I pistol what

death is looting all there's not much

time you find a scimitar that is drow

made with several notches cut into the

blade and Alice looks this over very

carefully and she can identify

positively that this is the murder

weapon

oh so this drought was holding the

murder weapon and she seems really

excited about that she's like with your

permission sir I'll take this back to

the city watch right away and let them

know that we found the murder absolutely

does evidence you should take it she

does she takes it back a few days later

you know you see in the papers that in

the broadsheets

they they are sensationalizing this the

demise of this assassin Captain death

would row right along my name in the

paper

well then if death says that every time

a reporter comes then it's a sergeant

Alice yes this Kelly don't ya give the

credit to her sergeant Ellis kind of

Dona organize this sting that took down

this amazing shot you know this horrible

assassin that was murdering people in

Waterdeep and a few days later Dallas

asked deaath out for another drink just

to kind of celebrate their their win and

they're having drinks they're sitting

there and it's probably business stuff

she picks up the jack and actually

learning to leave she she's explained to

dia that actually because of all of this

she got promoted to captain and they

Cheers over that well-deserved

congratulations and she when you say

congratulations she looks at you

meaningfully and puts her hand on yours

thank you I couldn't have done it

without you and she gives D at the kiss

though though her eyes betray the hope

for more

I didn't make that part up that was in

the paper yeah thanks Chris Perkins your

turn Holly Kate this all right we got to

see what fun drawing is on the back of

all of these yeah you know this is

called three ships I count two ships so

far there's only sons with hearts oh oh

this is even time not done all right

read this one first Polly my turn okay

evylyn spends a warm summer evening

buying small gifts for her friends the

red sky makes her happy as it means she

can look forward to a beautiful sunrise

she returns home before nightfall only

to find a stranger in her bedroom

standing in front of a mirror admiring

his figure is the dark elf

lothar lothario Jarl axel Bane ray he

tells evil and how radiant she looks and

then recites the following poem to her I

am NOT going to do a French accent I'm

sorry yes and if I languished into

dreams again I need the ardent pians

Queen of things I dare not to die in

beings deeps past year and I Lester I

find the same deceiver and be the spot

the fate forever thread power but dear a

son thou be and make me quite and give

myself to me

quitting's putting his centuries of

experience to the ultimate test Jarl

axel tries to sweep the fair evylyn off

her feet after saying all the right

things he invites her to a private

dinner and dance aboard his ship so you

have a nice night talking to him and he

invites you to his ship do you decide to

go or not well a girl's got to have a

conversation first I mean although I did

just kind of have an episode listening

to that poetry I didn't really

understand all the words but it sounded

real nice Jared you're like relax I'll

try and Louisville won of course dancing

would be but the small part of the

evening there's many things I could show

you like what

[Applause]

like the appreciation that you've never

had before you just want to appreciate

me I sure do why me what you know why

are you showing me all this special

attention there's all these you know

people that live here that you you know

help you with the pie that you made and

everything like that because my fair

lady

I am a draw and someone such as myself

does not get under the sunlight very

often and yet I find myself wanting more

and more your radiant beauty I don't

wish to force you to do anything you can

always say no and that I will respect I

do love dancing palton pokes his head in

he wrote me a poem forgot your name I

forget how it goes but it was real nice

his name's Carol Axl he's like hey even

guy talk to you really quick why it's a

busy look we still it's like they're

still they're still a half hour left in

this session my player really has to go

the bathroom is there any way he can

like dip out for a quick second what

okay you guys you guys carry on if no

one gets mad at me I'll be right back

you guys have fun now don't worry he

really appreciates this he's literally

in so much pain

[Applause]

[Laughter]

[Applause]

I'm gonna be honest with you there was a

time where I don't know there was there

was something there so I don't know but

he just was really not interested so I'm

afraid now that it's weird you know cuz

I kind of put myself out there and he

doesn't said no a grave mistake on his

part certainly someone such as himself

would never deserve a fine manifestation

of perfection such as yourself well if

you keep talking like that we better get

going dancing right now alright yeah

okay Jarl axel gently takes evylyn by

the hand and pulls her into a shadowy

corner of her room upon the room

disappears and evenlyn finds herself

stant standing in a splendid cabin

aboard a vessel anchored in water deeps

Harbor she can see the lights of the

dock ward through the large windows of

the ask a soul the cabin is bedecked

with golden filigree the purple curtains

festoon with golden tassels the wood

paneling scented with perfume a

magnificent feast sprawls atop a

mahogany table of exquisite

craftsmanship the doilies are patterned

to look like little suns a soft pleasing

music rises from an unknown source Jarl

axel flashes his pearly white teeth and

welcomes evylyn aboard the eye-catcher

as they dance darling soul whispers a

secret in Evelyn's ear he hates almond

otters so much that he restored Lysander

to prominence by killing father Luke son

right knowing that the priest would be

resurrected and humiliated in the

process while he admits that his actions

are not keeping it with the tape in

keeping in the teachings of Lysander

Jarl axel seems to know more about the

morning Lord

anyone evylyn has ever met and he vows

not to meddle in the temples affairs

again there's something irresistible

about him in many ways he reminds evylyn

of her father

dural axles soothing words coupled with

the beautiful music wash away all

concerns as evil and lowers her guard

and throws herself into Jarl Axl's arms

[Music]

[Laughter]

sodium where should I start the world

play on that I know that's that's I mean

you you were your inderal Axl's cabin

and you have thrown yourself into his

arms all right so we're snuggling in a

corner yeah even's like I just I don't

know I don't know if assassinating my

mentor was really the right place to

start I mean I agree with you on Amma

not war but I mean it was really

unpleasant to see my mentor like that I

mean personally and then there's also

the fact that you know so many people I

mean my friend diya kind of got blamed

for the whole thing you know do you I

certainly know him but my lady

if there was something I was preventing

the rise of the Sun wouldn't you I

wanted to be moved I remove is the cloud

blocking the Sun so beautiful

so that's why I'm eight so so this is

going well that's what I missed so oh no

she's like she's like cover just relax

oh so just a recap so evylyn the paladin

of Lysander is falling into the arms of

this like lying murderous drow yeah and

you wonder why the reddit debates your

alignment it was if the door is were

sons well that's it that's in the

scenario that's where you enough I can

check the other envelope let's see okay

oh there's I won't I want to see what

the other envelope is over there this

one says extra oh man cuz we sure are I

read the other envelope and it's messed

up I did well I won't know that I'm a

little boy

I read the others okay so yeah these are

all just kind of depends how much time

we have which we have a little bit if

they're like one little fun quick things

we can do them the other I guess I

shouldn't read them all and choose one

right we should just pick one I guess so

okay oh you're gonna go board I guess I

guess I have deemed the least cuz I just

read it and didn't want to do a French

accent

sure okay what are we supposed to do it

oh just okay well this is for Yemen

alright

evylyn new after spending a lovely night

with Jarl Axl however much you wanted to

cuddle or not couple a totally rub your

beds depends

that's up to you we're all having

problems today okay you see you go to

the temple and you find a young married

couple that who worship Lysander and

they ask if they come up to you and

they're very excited and they're holding

a new baby girl and ask you because

you're such a renowned paladin of

Lysander and now that Aminata has been

has been displaced and now it's back to

the temple of Lysander they ask you to

name their baby girl god what a

responsibility the kids just screaming

nothing precious about it it's just

tonight a dad

so like the wife is all like oh my god

they're burying the dad just like I

haven't slept in two weeks are you the

mom no I'm the mom oh you're the mom

okay yes with me sure I'll be there okay

cool yeah what an honor to ask me the

name you back do you have any like you

know thoughts or feelings that you want

to convey or characteristics I mean

maybe um help and she just she just

looks at that like both of you and she's

just like levander wanted us to make new

wife and so we did he wasn't really

really wanted it but I think that it'll

grow on him I mean she will grow that's

how babies work yeah yeah every time I

look into her eyes I it's just screaming

I get lost in the ways that I could just

you know anyway what so please please we

need a name we we can't we can't not

name our daughter this is a big this is

a big responsibility I think we should

make it a team effort you're asking me

to do anything with a baby well I mean

it's it's all about growing

and let's see what a total item expander

because everything is the light of

Lysander just trying to be good to the

church you know right now

do you know what I seem just trying to

help the church you know what I've seen

you I see great hope for the future

I see knapsack hope I think he just

starts like crying she takes her hand

evil in and she's like hope is a

beautiful oh but she needs some middle

name as well it can be max I hope that's

beautiful I knew a guy named knapsack

once and right from captain Woodrum

himself how's everyone know that my

wonderful husband may she be blessed

makes you be blessed by a lot of

Lysander all of her days thank you so

much with ander blessing and they leave

and have a miserable life well I hope we

never have to see knapsack again pick a

day doesn't matter when Tuesday sure

we're all hanging out in the the main

part of the of the waffle manner and

Warrington monk comes downstairs I say

I've been thinking about this

establishment and how about is quite

poor defenses if there was no Taylor a

strike and or a barrage birds who would

be quite overwhelmed whole do you think

there will be an artillery strike we you

could never be too prepared that's true

nothing were overwhelmed all the time

I'm personally overwhelmed constantly I

don't mean internal overwhelming I mean

actual explosions and cannons and

bombardments well what do you think we

should do I believe that the top of the

waffle house itself in the turret we

could easily place a cannon

that's a big gun right that's a big gun

how long will that keep you busy one

bring it back bring it up to the touch I

don't care how long will you do things

that aren't coming and asking us

questions is also like super hungover so

the sound of Warrington's voice just

like someone has two power drills going

this is a terrible idea

Wow we don't need heavy weaponry within

the house like if we shoot that and miss

we're hitting somewhere else within this

city I'm pretty sure that I'm a cannon I

yeah you are but you have control over

where you set your magic none of us are

experienced at using a cannon to which

Larkin says I have experience in all

forms of firearms whether those within

your hands or placed upon reels or on

the side of a ship wait a cannon does

explosions perhaps you've been a course

across a vessel along Stussy with

cannons to shoot off oncoming terrible

sea creatures or perhaps I think there's

plenty of individuals here who could

operate it I for one have you know

operated a a pistol and also one time I

threw a Molotov cocktail and it was

awesome do you remember that do you guys

remember that

that's pretty Sarah my I remember that's

good

yes we're not putting a cannon in here

that's too dangerous and too stupid plus

then we also like store ammunition an

additional smoke powder powder wonderful

it does sound I'm just I must say as a

paladin it's very important for me to be

up-to-date and proficient with all

weaponry hmm and if I do understand now

that a gun is a weapon one that may be

used by others or that I may be tasked

with using at some point I should learn

to use them so Warrenton will you give

me gun lessons well teaching someone

such as yourself to use all kinds of

firearms or perhaps even every artillery

such as captain's I believe you will be

quick study I think Sofia this is

something I could certainly teach you in

great yes right behind was going no care

if he's busy and he's not talking to us

that's all I really care about yeah

should be a bakery house why would we

put a cannon on the top what kind of

message when we were attacked by

dinosaur if we just have a yeah cuz

we're in a jungle a different dinosaur

came also pie thievery and water dave

has gone up exponentially since we

opened our business I think we need our

line of defense I think you're starting

to have to block out memories because

there was a dinosaur at our door once

yeah remember you're cute pathetic to

kill remember that I do I'm just missing

I'm just saying if we somehow miss with

this cannon on top of our turret and hit

some innocent persons house that's why I

should know how to use it yeah that

doesn't mean like they'll they could

dodge out of the way or they could be an

illusion just fight him build the cannon

about this what's the point of this

he'll give me gun lessons I will learn

about so-called firearms and then as

soon as I have a better grasp of what

the heck these things do we will revisit

the subject of a cannon alright so no no

so for now no we'll shelve the subject

and come back to it later what's the

point of being roommates with the

captain if you can't even put a cannon

on top of your house that's not what

being a captain is about let's talk to

about smoothing with a sergeant if she's

a captain now first off and second no

I'm not thank you seem a little

defensive so you made it happen captain

he made a captain happen wait are you

talking about this well I think the

matter settled in Warrington will just

say excellent I will be more than

pleased at least teach someone else

about the glorious that of firearms we

shall do it somewhere peaceful and safe

so no possible injuries to yourself or

others can happen I too will be

attending these classes of course

pipin great all right we have one more I

think okay oh you look right at me Strix

huh

it has been three weeks since you've

sold a single pot

they've been stolen no no one's even

stealing them anymore

business is not good friends I'm not

selling pies I'm very depressed the pie

shops not making enough money profits

are down what are you gonna do about it

stop notice there aren't too many

customers in here lately why is that I

think it's because of depression I've

been running the books and our profits

have been going down quite a bit

you know I think we need a marketing

campaign mm-hmm

well I'm not gonna marketing because I'm

weird and no one marries our you're our

brand also squidly has been eating all

of the leftover pies and has gotten so

fat squidly yes I'm not going to give

you any more pious why because you've

eaten all of the pies and now we're not

making money and soon we'll all stop

there's still like 30 pie oh that no

one's buying really I want you to go

walk around the alley for about eight

hours thank you in circles and then when

you're done I'll let you I'll let you

have a pie and I'll let you talk to

palton okay he like goes to take a step

out of the door and just kind of keep

going crawl it like falls over he's just

this like balloon tiefling you just like

remember eight hours rolls out the table

we need a sign maybe we need best pies

and Waterdeep as well no wait the food

critic was murdered so no we can't have

best pies in Waterdeep oh do you think

that's why probably and I think we

should have a health and safety campaign

look at I mean squidly so fat maybe we

need the house pass no I know that's an

idea what if we sell something else no I

mean we do pies well pop but we can be

pies and

what do you want to sell I was hoping

someone would fill in the drink

wow those are mine maybe we could make

something like a like a good berry pie

that heals you could you mail it I mean

I can't but I know there's that druid

that lives across the street

like maybe they always look really

exasperated we ask them saying things

but sometimes they most the time they

say yes I got it will enlist the help of

Warrington

and then it can be Strix is pies and

guns I like the idea of healing pies

yeah we could put some crystals in the

know the windows and we could get some

you know we could do some like rituals

and people could come for healing let

the Sun Shine in maybe we should just

give it up now we don't need to make

pies anymore mate how about we go talk

to the drew everyone has new friends I'm

just gonna leave I will go talk to the

druid for you and ask about healing

berries alright this was supposed to be

a fun last card let's just give up

we should on that note they plan to go

talk to the Druids now Chris we have a

hanging thing that we're gonna do in the

next epochs wants to make pies with just

a few good berries mixed in so that they

can heal a few hip points yeah ventures

high-end pies that are also healing

instead of those nasty tasting healing

potions yeah yeah this a great idea

healing potion pies awesome so we have

successfully had a waffle bear ship a

City Guard ship a weird Jarl axel ship

and now even staking gun lessons Strix

is gonna be healing pies palsy knows how

to make Molotov cocktail and is an ex

carnie right anything else that I'm

missing squidly is a round boy jinx now

has a new album puppet that's horrific

because I had to make him a new one

and that makes is depressed and there's

a child named hope knapsack some water

tea and there could be a little al bear
