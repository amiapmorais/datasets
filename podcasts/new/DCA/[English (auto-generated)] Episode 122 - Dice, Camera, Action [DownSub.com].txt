hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action our last show of 2018 nate is

traveling Anna is off for the holidays

but we have two gracious guest artists

with us tonight we got two people aren't

doing anything nothing better to do

James and James to distinguish you Joey

you're now Joey and that's great because

that's what most people call you just

the way I like ya previously indice

camera action the waffle crew and the C

team were born away to a distant town

called Nightstone where they got a taste

of the blood war between devils and

demons all of this precipitated by a

age-old conflict between two planar

families of which Strix and DF were

members oh we're starting with this okay

yeah yeah Strix was rescued from members

of the Skiz excursion and to keep the

multiverse from ending accepted rosy bee

stingers offered to join the beast

family in so doing setting the

multiverse a right

d/f provided comfort districts in this

moment realizing that they could now be

friends without triggering an

apocalyptic war perhaps perhaps even

more than friends all right on the

asteroid city known as the rock of brawl

to give one sergeant Ernest paka

and one corporal Rufus durm make their

way through crowded dirty streets to the

middle city where there is a tavern

fairly well up kept with a seating area

outside

as the golden helm and there they have a

rendezvous with their commanding officer

major argos crux and when they arrive

they see him sitting outside for though

this establishment is a large two-story

rambling affair its doorways are far too

small to accommodate the typical GIF

girth and height and so the major enjoys

a private table off on one corner where

he can watch passers-by and the gleaming

starry night that is perpetual in the

smog-filled skies of brawl on the

distant horizon you can see the great

Moon Saloon a shimmering silver beneath

you and as you approach you notice that

there is not only the major who is far

too big to sit in one of the dainty

little chairs that the golden helm has

to offer so he brought with him his

personal ottoman plopped down on there

having a bounteous feast tale table

piled high with food and right now he's

cracking into some sort of purple

lobster like creature and while this is

going on his adjutant a private is

standing off to the side solemnly hands

tucked behind his back watching the

crowds warily and you can see this

private is wearing a hippo helm over his

head and when you come up to the major

he says ah

thunder lightning right on time

yes yes good to see you sir

swell up get right to it because you can

see he sucks to something out of a like

a lobster claw and throws it down on the

on the table and then dabs his lips with

a handkerchief and sets that down neatly

beside him and says I was very impressed

recently with your battle prowess and

decorum in the Battle of the Garden

war no I'm entrusting you with a most

delicate mission to protect one hegemon

bee stinger as he makes his way world

side now major have is that a name that

we've heard somewhere before have Lea

any dealings with this bee stinger man

says you don't know this but some

sinister race is exterminating halfling

worlds across the crystal spheres indeed

flora stands the a bee stingers have

done the best that they can here made

names for themselves and this hegemon

bee stinger has arisen to the position

of under baron one of several in this

scum ridden city and they are trying to

weather the storm and resist this menace

before they too and other halfling

worlds are annihilated and as you know

they also press a uniform better than

anyone in exchange for a sizable cache

of armaments and the ammunition to go

with it we have graciously offered to

ensure that hegemon stripped to the

world below goes as planned and that he

comes to no harm and that is why i have

tasked you fine gentlemen with

protecting him from any animus

permission to speak freely and ask a

question what a false yes is there

anything we should know about this city

were headed to planetside it is a place

called deep water and yes and well like

most people or most worlds they have no

idea of what goes on in the skies above

and we just assume preserve that world

well as well I call them waddles yes yes

scrambling they often tend to

misunderstand such things so best keep

it under your lids do not under any

circumstances mention the rocket brawl

or your business just tend to the

security of your charge excellent and

yes sir

will there be plenty of munitions on

site or should we bring our own I have

seen fit to ensure that additional

munitions are delivered to the ship that

you will be taking down to the surface

it is called the mimsy its captain is

one fat rabbit only Neoga bates wouldn't

have heard of him yes well best carry on

then business what was your charge is

waiting for you aboard the mimsy he will

give you more instructions about what

you ought to do once you're planetside

very well we accept this mission with

great order sir yes yes thank you and he

shushes you away but then he says Oh

gentlemen should you meet this quest and

fulfill it to my expectation expect a

fine bottle of sherry in your quarters

upon your return from my personal stock

yes shove off now yes and he goes back

to tearing into his meal and I waddle

away as you make your way down to the

lower City in the docks you are greeted

with all sorts of foul smells sweat

smoke pipe smoke industry smoke filth

the streets are dirty you do your best

not to brush up against buildings with

your broad shoulders as you make it real

long so as not to scuff your uniforms as

you make your way to the docks and there

you at the end of a particularly long

wretched

Bente doc you see this small cutter

basically sails up with the word mimsy

in in beautiful scrollwork on the aft

castle and it is staffed almost

completely by halflings and there's a

lot of chittering on board and business

to get the ship prepped and what what as

you walk your way up the gangplank it

bends and bows under your weight and as

you step foot on the deck the ship leans

to one side but it appears to be just be

floating off this dock in empty space

with the great moon of saloon a below

you I I say Oh Thunder what is it you do

know about this fat rabbit I may have

told the food like know nothing about

myself I can't say I've ever heard a

single thing about him but I can't - I

can't what the major no that oh yes no

no oh good show old chap all right I

think no it's quite a good one yes I'm

broken anyway I you you quickly become

acquainted with members of the crew as

they bustle about they were certainly

expecting you the captain you can see is

a tiny whip of a halfling with a a hat

and a feather and a tiny crab perched on

his shoulder like a king crab that's

awesome

yes and he doesn't seem to pay much

attention to you he's more concerned

with now that you're aboard getting

underway as quickly as possible it is

then that you're charged hegemon bee

stinger or who you assumed to be graces

you with his presence and he seems to

come out of nowhere it's like he's just

sort of standing between you you just

notice him there and you can see he's

where he is first of all striking

because he is a halfling so he's really

really tiny like up to your kneecap and

he's very very pale almost ghost-like

I would venture to say albino

oh and he is wearing a black robe like a

wizard's robe covered with all kinds of

weirdly shaped patches that seem to have

been just sort of hastily somewhat

stitched on in kind of a random

nonsensical pattern you see a patch that

kind of looks like a bag another one

that kind of looks like a door another

one that kinda looks like a ladder and a

horse and a dog and a bottle just like

weird assortment of patches on his rope

wouldn't ask uniform inspection if you

worked it so like that it I'm standing

right here and I grab a silver bugle off

my belt and I play a fanfare stop just

stop stop okay you must be Thunder he

says to you no no no I would not have

the honor Thunder is the handsome One

yes that's a common mistake

he is the lightning okay okay don't talk

so loud ears are very sensitive we will

try to lower our voices to your

permissible standards yes as much as

thunder and lightning Kenza okay all

right so okay here here here's the deal

guys

we're going down to the planet and

nobody needs nope nobody can know that

I'm gonna be there so I need you to be

discreet

yes would can you be discreet yes the

strictness is my middle name

okay okay now normally I take you below

deck so we could talk about what's going

to happen but since you won't fit down

there I'm gonna have to tell you here

fortunately nobody else will care okay

my sister Harsha whom I love has been

sentenced to a labor camp outside of the

city of Waterdeep and we need to break

her out good god yes by the spheres and

there's only one way that we can

accomplish this and that's what the help

of another B stinger so we're going down

to water deep to find one and I know

where she lives

and once we get there we're gonna get

her to help us break my sister out

splendid

it's simple recruitment and acquisition

so how exactly we're going to be

discreet in this matter well once we get

to the city don't tell anybody Who I am

it's very important that no one in

Waterdeep know that there's a bee

stinger has just arrived moreover and

just to make it clear my sister was

wrongly imprisoned in this labor camp oh

of course

yes yes of course we wouldn't break the

law yes she was she was convicted of

firearms possession but she doesn't even

own a firearm she would never own a

firearm

why does my law so I think water yes is

run by a bunch of human tightest s--

that's right yes yes well I'm sorry

about the part about firearm possession

being illegal yes she was arrested for

owning a beautiful beautiful black

powder weapon answer yes yeah like I

can't even imagine like how could this

even happen unless the whole system was

corrupt the whole system must be just

corrupt my sister is the nicest most

gentle halfling in this crystal sphere

this is a grave injustice a corrupt

system cannot be allowed to stand we

must absolutely break her off forthwith

and bring her back and and see the

justices no no no no no no no no no no

my job is to break her out your job

lightning thunder whatever your name is

is to protect me me yes I am an under

Baron of the rock of brawl my security

is paramount paramount do you understand

what paramount means

yes yes yes your orders are as crystal

clear as a crystal sphere sir yes all

right then

I have to go below decks and pilot this

little ship hey walk don't worry about

discretion I say as I'm pinning grenades

to a bandolier don't worry

yes and then you hear him mumbling as he

walks away my sister is very important

to me she helps me run everything here I

don't know what I'd do without her the

ship leaves and you begin to make your

way across charted space heading across

the silvery forests and lakes that cover

the moon of saloon a and then as you

come up over this great moon an even

larger celestial body presents itself to

you the great planet of toriel revealed

as you leave the rock of brawl and the

dark side of the moon and head to this

vast vast world I never tire of this yes

beautiful yes it is a beautiful journey

and as you make your way down through

the atmosphere of the planet the air

around you ripples and changes the

envelope of magical air that had

sustained you up to this point sort of

is torn away by the cool north air the

sea air from the sea of sorts as you

descend toward a vast coastline and

settle in the water about 20 miles away

and then chart a course like a

conventional craft toward Waterdeep

Harbor and upon your arrival no one

there suspects that the mimsy is

anything but a small little cutter craft

from some podunk northern city or town

until two giant hippo men get off of it

well that is that is true once it

touches down in the water and makes a

conventional applies the waters into

water Bay into Waterdeep Harbor hegemon

basically comes back

and leaves the sailing of the ship to

the crew and so now he's with you and he

says I have to apologize I'm very upset

I was a little Curt with you earlier and

I didn't mean to be I'm not like that

yes but my sister is intolerable I hope

you understand that oh yes I have a

sister myself understand very much sir

he dad he dabs the tears from his eyes

and and corporal Durham is like a

brother to me if anything were to happen

to him well sir I would be more than a

little bit Curt I don't care what

happens to him well you sergeant PACA

sir you are indeed like a brother to me

to a more handsome more intelligence

more strategic brother and mr. B's

singer we are contractually obligated to

care about what happens to you I know I

know

once you climb off the ship onto the

dock and make your way along you can you

can see hegemon is looking around and of

course you're garnering a lot of

attention from dock workers and whatnot

but the thing about water davian's which

hegemon tells you that to their credit

they may be high 'test but they don't

seem to care about anything

and so being you too tall or too short

they don't seem to mind as we turn to

buy they are however struck by your

accoutrement mm-hmm but a little too

intimidated to say anything as we're

going I pop a little like Paris oh

because I'm worried oh yeah hegemon skin

is gonna burn in the Sun so I'm like

carrying it over him while we walk he

sort of stops for a minute and looks up

at the the shade that's in Delta and the

parasol and he says yes yes here to

protect you to from the sun's rays my

friend I'm beside myself and then he

walks on and he says there should be

somebody here we made arrangements for

somebody to pick us up and deliver us by

cart and he stops at that moment and as

you look you see that his gaze is

trained upon there is a cart

just parked on the the wharf amid some

supplies and cargo that was offloaded

from other ships there's not much to it

except it's an open-topped card like

you'd throw hay bales in the back of

obviously thinking about gif there's

really no place to put you but in one of

these things but standing outside the

cart is a strawberry haired halfling

holding up a big sign that says bee

stinger yes the very name of discretion

yes as you can see you can see hegemon

face just goes from white to red and

like a little you imagine almost imagine

a little thundercloud forming over there

I run over and try to grab the sign and

rip it in half okay the the strawberry

haired halflings little shocked and sort

of gasps but he doesn't he doesn't stop

you and you tear it up yes yes

discretion hegemon just sort of walks

over to him and just kind of stands

right in front of them half lean to half

length and just shakes his head I

trailed him like his shadow and I and I

shake my head - and then when thunder

shakes his head I shake my head see the

strawberry head halfling doesn't really

know what what has happened but he says

I was gonna take you now - there's the

places we found out that the places on

troll skull alley it's in the North Ward

it'll take us about 20 minutes to get

there

proceed says hegemon sternly and at that

point you can see that the halfling

lowers down some put some basically some

boxes so the hegemon can step up on to

where the driver sits and the driver can

sit next to him and then hegemon just

tells you to pile him back all right

rule school le ah oh yes I almost forgot

some of the halfling crew also basically

on little dollies bring two big crates

of supplies which are just marked with a

Thunder cloud and a lightning bolt

ah is that our dinner our rations I know

those are your explosives Oh careful

with that oh yes yes yes a one wrong

move and you could blow us all sky-high

all right

and thus you make your way fully armed

through town mm-hmm

Strix and DF you are well what are you

up to

Oh probably being home and unassuming

reading a broad sheet drinking your

coffee yeah

and Strix is just probably doing stuff

for the bakery yeah she might actually

have a couple customers poking their

heads in and just buying some stuff and

leaving yeah I imagine a couple of them

poked their heads in and she agreed I'm

just like and then they immediately

leave yes there's there's business at

the temple that has drawn evil in a way

and and palton actually has taken up

some I wouldn't call them obligations

but some other prospects for performing

Wow since his market thing went off with

such a bang he's been in demand and

people have been looking for him to put

to play play in Inns and taverns and

whatnot and so he and Simon have gone

off in that regard so things things are

remarkably quiet and the kids are out

playing and as as some customers leave

your doorway is darkened well the first

thing is you hear you hear a clattering

wagon outside and then your doorway is

darkened by a pale halfling in black

patchwork robe I doubt I'm anywhere near

the doorway probably oh wait no I wasn't

it was I near the doorway if you were if

you're like behind the counter you would

see the doorway

yeah okay then I would see the doorway

I'd look over and be like well god

you're way more customers

I am NOT a customer but I am here to see

Strix bee stinger Oh

for what reason and at this point you

can see through the window that there

are some really big hippo men unloading

boxes from the back of this cart yeah my

eyes like dart to that like like like I

know that's a problem but I'm still

focusing I was halfling like oh why

would you need to be in touch with her

not saying that I'm not her are you I'm

not getting answer that until you tell

me what you need her for I've been told

that by my friends to not say things

unless I find out what it's for first

that's how you get involved with Devils

ok um so my name is hegemon and I need

your help

uh huh not saying that's me with some

family business oh oh right ok uh yes

that is me yes it is I suppose my

obligation to help with family business

right he looks around to see if all the

customers are gone and then he skulks

over to the counter and he sort of

disappears cuz he's so small but you

sort of hear over the counter and you

see him looking up over the glass and he

says I am a bee sting I do Oh

welcome friendly brother ok um so do you

want a pie doing some tea also are those

HIPAA or hippo people with you because I

really just hope that they're not here

to pick up ours because I'm just so

tired of him pip pip they come in here

they come in with their big boxes

Warrington your friends are here to take

you home

you know you somewhere

I like point towards our like strongest

chairs okay I'm just like please use the

table that warrington has broken about

17 times so I've had to put it back

together you see you see you see some

chairs that look like they have been put

back together or a fairly sturdy you

also see a very sturdy looking

velvet-lined Gothic monstrosity in a

corner when when she screams Warrington

however that rings bells for you too

because you know a Warrington or you

know of him rather but it can't be it

can't be that Warrington oh my god so I

give you thunder I like take out the

monocle and give you the stair you don't

mean Commodore Warrington month do you I

don't know but I definitely leave me

more in two months

it definitely in our basement or

somewhere maybe in the walls I honestly

don't know where he's been he's been

slowly migrating up to the Attic because

it's got higher ceilings and it's

unfortunately it's right across from DF

that's the downside so you start

shouting his name so when once you

realize that it's the same Warrington

month here's what the two of you know

about Warrington month Warrington Mundt

was a a senior officer he did something

that that that gift can only aspire to

and that is during an engagement with a

mind flayer vessel he basically shot

himself out of a cannon at the mind

flayer vessel

with a bomb and blew it up it was it was

basically a suicide mission after the

gift bombard Yamato which he was serving

on ran out of ammunition the thump like

something nice DMS allowed to happen it

exploded in the atmosphere of this

planet and was basically obliterated my

dear lightning I think we may very well

be in the presence of a living legend

yes one pitch no one knew was living sir

yes it's by the spheres this incredible

you're taking him home right we'd be

honored merely to see the hesitant is

IDI great yes surely this is his stop he

owns it no he does not I will be right

back I'm gonna bring you a pie all of

you you all get pies and I will be right

back

really I mean like go as fast as I can

take this throw pies no matter which

ones all right she just tosses some pies

down in front of you we would be honored

to eat the pies made by a friend of

Warrington munch I don't know that she

runs up she runs up this spiral

staircase that corkscrews up through the

middle of the taproom and disappears

upstairs

whereupon hegemon conjures forth a

spectral hand and slaps the pies out of

your mouth and off the table and says

what are you doing this isn't about you

and this is now your stupid dead friend

this is about me this is about me and my

sister and rescuing her what are you

doing how does this how does this

further our mission it gives you extra

protection sir in the form of a living

legend you see I am but a lowly corporal

this here is a mighty sergeant but a

Commodore

a Commodore hero caliber of Commodore

Munt you can see the value in that

yes and of course at no extra charge to

you since we are his ride home

oh that's a very good point and I am

sorry I overreacted and I'll get you

some more pies yes yes ooh no thank you

thank you very much go for the ones that

are berry custard you see the berry cuts

the sweetness with the tartness it's

very nice and then I light up a cigar

over the explosives

okay let's checks you find DF

sequestered in his quiet place I imagine

by just running up the stairs it's like

I'll be right back you are not surprised

when you hear her screams get closer and

closer and closer yeah you are and you

can hear Warrington is in the other on

the other side of this level of the

house and his attic just sort of moving

boxes and clearing out of space and

making it more homey

yeah stretch like slams open the door

whatever she does probably happens like

four times a day yeah like damn so

there's a half leg feet stay here down

there I don't know I may be a wizard I'm

not sure but there's also do more

Warrington mods two of them two more of

them down there death is sitting at desk

friend of them a few of them have the

same Lords Alliance emblem yeah and upon

hearing this just kind of quits just

quill back his chair and walks up

restrictions goes what and they've got

cigars and monocles and they talk too

much and they just they're they're the

same there's Eames Warrington mine and

I've yelled at him I don't think he

heard me because he's like dragging

around and they're here for Warrington

uh no hair leader here for me apparently

the be stickers

eat something from me I don't know they

need help uh just okay well uh I don't

know what they need yet I don't ask

those questions because usually I say

yes to everything so I need to have my

answers monitored right by what little I

understand the bee stinger like are you

obligated to do this I mean I don't know

I don't know either I don't I mean I

don't think I'm obligated obligated like

forced to it's not like a like well

Fowler no maybe not but if we can help

another bee sting or maybe it's at least

a small way to repay Rosie yeah

yeah I mean if it helps Rosie or grandma

yeah it'll be simple easy to do and then

they can take Warrenton and he can go

home back to his homeland safely which

would be great wouldn't it be great sure

would Oh tell Warrington yes please I'll

go down and continue to give these hippo

people pies cuz they're our customers

good job okay runs back down we're good

after after shake after she runs back

down Warrington actually sort of pokes

out through his door I could just miss

something mm-hmm then he goes back into

his room and says I wish these rafters

we're about two feet higher can't do

that oh no building has something called

foundation just look oh yeah what we

need you downstairs why because there

are some friends to see with crates of

smoke powder

and thus and thus sergeant Ernest PACA

and corporal Rufus der Maur confronted

by Commodore Warrington Mundt you can

see that he is out of uniform and

holding a duster then when DF also gets

downstairs he just like oh my god they

have more smoke powder and you can see

warrant and Mundt has a apron that's too

small for him just sort of stretched

over his belly and tie it off behind him

[Music]

God looks and he's out of uniform by

word what is this then corporal sergeant

you've caught me somewhat amiss what are

you laughing at ding-dong that's not his

name that's okay though I'm tired of

saying it's not and he looks at the

blocks at the crates and he says it's

not my birthday

Commodore we have not the words mm-hmm

well then allow me to do the talking

what brings you to this fair

establishment business of this a very

very small one they look down at the bee

stinger yes he is very small and you see

hegemon just clenches his fists he is

our charge which is a secret we have

come to protect him well knowing of your

bravery sir we are wondering if you need

a ride back ride back yes I'm sure the

crew of the Yamato would want to play

their respects he

says they survived then thanks to your

act of bravery ah yes I've heard they

survived they did survive right capital

but uh I'm afraid before we can bring

you back to you know we're in the you

know what we have something of a mission

to attend to first

Commodore tricks is just listening this

whole Bay would like one I like ah yes

of course

wink wink very good yes it requires the

utmost discretion I see you are already

in a disguise sir yes it's only we had

been so excellently prepared yes yes

well carry on then I shall get out of

this SATA tire and and fit myself

appropriately maybe I'll see we few

minutes at your leave sir yes mm-hmm and

they sort of looks for a place to put

down the feather duster and then just

kind of takes it with him it appears

excuse me houseboy and I am talking to

death now yes you are must be a servant

boy of the house um where could you put

our things for us

dodo notes just like nope there's no

servants here we have no servants

there's no this is my shop can we please

talk about the mission at hand all right

okay tell me what you need first of all

so that the hippos can leave he turns

the halfling turns to you death and says

my name is hegemon bee stinger and i

have come to rescue my sister and I need

strictest help to do it

because she is very powerful sorcerer if

the point if the reports are true they

are true and we be singers have to stick

together

the whole multiverse is against us I

mean I don't believe that

I don't care okay hegemon who is your

who is your sister my sister's name is

Harsha she's beautiful and smart and a

year younger than me and she has been

sentenced to a place outside of the city

called a men's farm have you heard of it

it's a labor camp a labor camp

my sister is in a labor camp have I

heard of my mom's farm you have I feel

like so right outside the walls of the

city it's all pasture land to the north

and east there's even a small town up

there and there's a whole bunch of farms

that actually supply a lot of the city's

produce and dairy and whatnot but amid

these farms is a special farm a

particularly large farm where criminals

of the city are often sent to do

quote-unquote hard labor what that

really means is they're put up in tents

in this fenced-in farm and forced to

basically tend to the farm under the

guard in the city of the Army of

Waterdeep City Guard so it is it is a

fortified farm with like a concentration

camp like tent city for the prisoners

and then there's a big barn and there's

a dairy and other facilities on site

surrounded by gardens that are tended to

and harvested by criminals and this is

seen as like a Reform kind of camp a

person might be sentenced here for a

summer or a whole year or several years

depending on the magnitude of their

crime okay so it's more like

rehabilitation than harsh punishment

yeah it's not like crack and rocks so

it's not onerous work but it is and its

product it's productive it serves the

city so it's called amends farm because

it's a way for criminals to make amends

and earn back the trust of the city

gotcha okay

so that towards hegemon then I'll say

something I'll say well do you know what

she did - yes she was falsely accused of

trying a bearing and trying to sell

firearms which she didn't do cuz as I

explained to these big dummies she would

never have firearms and how would you

know she would never have it because she

she hated the smell of smoke powder god

I don't understand that at all they were

just looking to pin it on her I know it

because she's a good person

would you happen to know would you

happen to have any suspects that you

think actually caused this I don't care

I just got to get her out that's why I'm

here

that's why I brought these two they're

gonna help me do it and so is she

well that is if she wants to stay in the

family

I don't know oh I mean cuz that sounds

like the law and we've had run-ins with

the law and I really want to have more

remnants of law

maybe Diaz maybe you can ask them maybe

you can use your badge and ask them was

white his badge

I didn't mean to seem it I'm sorry I

don't know sorry

some people know me as captain the DA

through droves of Lords alliance I have

a certain pole here when it comes to the

law of water do you well that's great

usually I can't breathe

so by that extension if there was a

false accusation that's something I take

very very seriously and something that

you don't know what it's like to be

falsely accused the pain the loneliness

she's she's suffering without me

well Strix I mean if it's a bee stinger

that needs help I don't

maybe we should and if there's a false

accusation that's maybe it's something

that we should something we could try to

do to make it better you know you can

help with that yeah I'll do my best I

mean my best well I don't even know

where to start

should we go to the farm huh we'll do

that in a bit

first I'll see if I can't do some court

filing requisitions and see if I can't

figure out see how much paperwork is

still on the archives to pull up and see

if any of that will show any other

additional clues and then from there

maybe I can reopen the case and

investigate it that sounds like a lot of

time three hippo people will be living

in our establishment why oh no no no no

no no no no I want to do this legally if

we can yeah the beast thing our name is

worth something

honesty integrity loyalty he's making us

nuts

everyone was evil they're evil are you

evil oh okay well then that mean other

evil lady lied to me I should really

stop believing everyone that talks to me

okay well either way wait here I'll go

see what I could do and I'll be I'll be

back as soon as possible

won't take more than an hour yeah I

think we can wait that long this is this

is gonna be like that gift where he

comes back in with the pizza and

everything by the way do you have any

more pies yes you're you seem to be out

in the display case yes well meantime

I'm sure Warren can can regale them with

the tales of his many adventures great

idea so yes when Warrington

back down and this is probably like

minutes after DF will head out yeah so

the earth is gonna go to like one of the

watch stations and see what he can find

out about this Harsha D stinger yeah

yeah just need information about it

early Galatea soar right yeah so it

takes it takes Warrington a bit of time

to get his metals adjusted just right

right I figured this would bias by me at

least five hours yeah probably

and so as you head out Warrington comes

downstairs and begins regaling you about

what happened after he was shot into the

illicit nautiloids it looked like that

he was about to get his mind wiped by an

illicit when he set off the bomb that

blew the ship to smithereens and then he

rode the debris down through the

atmosphere and plunged into the ocean

where he was plucked out of the tide by

a passing ship which had these fine

people and others like it aboard and

that's how he was saved from an almost

certain ly watery grave which

coincidentally at the time also had

Captain death would row that's that's

true we're quick you think so

not long after DF leaves hegemon cuts

Warrington off and says okay I've heard

enough no more no more gift stories no

more war stories I don't need to know

about illicit ships or gift ships or

space battles the only thing that

concerns me is my sister and every

minute every day that she spends in that

labor camp is one minute and one day

that we are apart now that we've gotten

rid of that guy let's go yes yes as long

as you don't break any laws I think

direct action preferably with high-grade

explosives is the best way to go yes

indeed come to a much and I start

tossing Warrington grenades to outfit I

know it's not your famous rifle that we

have a blunderbuss right here for you by

God no just like

like mage hands starts like grenades

like none of that I'm not a nope and

also we need to hide these because as

soon as squiggly gets back I just can't

I can't deal with it I just can't

so I hegemon turns to you and he said

he's sort of tugs on your rope yes I

looked down and he says Strix we are

these singers we have to look after each

other

all right I say we let them create the

distraction that we need to get to my

sister once I get to her I can get her

out well here's the thing we can't break

any more loss I don't care about loss

these are water deep stupid laws I agree

with that and I don't come from out of

deep and Harsha doesn't come from water

deep and water deeps laws don't apply to

us

we're bee stingers they don't apply to

you laws apply to people no reason no

laws our laws are stupid unless you're

the one who's making them I mean I agree

with you if that laws are stupid but I

also have a aversion to getting my

friends put in jail cuz it makes them

sad

no we're breaking someone out of jail

don't you see that's the right thing to

do we don't put people in jail we get

people out I'm seeing your point I mean

I'd rather would you would you want to

be would you want to be spending the

next five years in a labor camp with no

friends and no family I mean I watch

yourself in those shoes

I spent 50 years alone and no I heard

tiny tiny little shoes they're really

tiny yours are tiny

everyone like you're just so small shut

up just agree with me well I just I

don't want to put any of my friends in

danger I I can help you I just I just

got your friend out of danger there is

no danger just you and me and be

stingers in

those guys with the bombs and let

them blow themselves up I don't want

them to take to bring any of those bombs

would you rather them stay here those

bombs in your bakery where they could

just blow it up everything you're sorry

that was a little louder than I intended

go back to your bombs go back I can't

just leave I can't just leave like that

I mean if we disappear it's gonna be

real bad

now now young lady we could make this

easy who's your commanding officer just

getting ordered from him and we'll be on

our way oh yeah but that's Diaz and you

want me to go without my commanding

officer

that's servant boy is your commanding

officer yes I did call him captain that

was if it helps I will be your

commanding officer I am senior B singer

family loyalty means something if I

don't agree to this does this mean that

I'm gonna have to go back to destroying

the multiverse that's right you won't be

a B singer anymore and you won't have

the protection of the family name you'll

be as whatever you were before I don't

remember it alright fine whatever you

want me to do I just don't want everyone

to get in trouble gather your things

boys we're heading out and I say at this

point

yes walks back in through the front door

having not made it five feet we're over

hearing everything make a perception

check and we'll see oh my god oh it's

real good okay 6:26 yes yeah as soon as

they like the door throws up and you're

like there yeah oh hey guys

I didn't I I messed up

it's our ice tricks just come on why

don't you go alone okay I was going to I

just don't want you to go to jail I'm

like I'm not going to jail you're not

going to jail no one's going to jail

hopefully but still let's better I go

with you if you guys gonna do anything

rash

that's fair

three gift the children in this house I

see toys everywhere yeah they're outside

playing I really don't want them to beat

you you're training them well they could

be a captain at a young age like this

lad says I have been waiting for this

for some time I must admit after you

plucked me out of those briny depths I

thought my end was near but you saved my

life for this is my chance to repay you

and in the company of such fine

gentlemen yes yes you know you never

told us anything Warrington but I

wouldn't dare defy you the time to put

that trust 'if spoke powdery firearm to

good use I know how much you like it

indeed I do we can go to space after

this and just leave forever find us do

we need to bring waffles you think do we

need it like waffles to eat a new on

earth you talking about vittles I'd

gladly eat something I'm half stop I

just gave you a cot no the less the

better for this it's going in there

we're gonna do an inquiry sir do these

do these three hippo people look like an

inquiry to you we are trained in the

manner of discretion nothing if not this

great yes that is why my nickname is

lightning and design is thunder exactly

and is Warrington Mundt

yes the faster we get this over the

faster I can kill back to making pies

your nickname is Strix it is quite

hilarious I do I turn to Warrington

Mundt and I say did you not tell her

what it means what oh they never came up

with a casual conversation and there's

not

I think a gentleman brings up to a lady

who's very embarrassed oh yes say what

is me you can't just say these this is

an object's problem and we should we

should carry on the mission first

foremost always the mission yes yes we

can tell you about little matters such

as names or meanings let's be afraid I

really stepped in it there then okay

it'd be the black staff if my main name

need something a smash cut - yes all

right

so getting out through the city won't be

that difficult because hegemon is going

to make all of you invisible except the

driver of the wagon of the cart and that

will be UDF since your race you're a

captain you won't have any trouble

getting in and out

I thought his reason gonna be because

I'm the servant boy but that's way

better yeah yeah yeah to his credit he

doesn't see you as a servant boy good

so from Charles call alley you take Sara

Doon Street to the high road and then

the high road into the field Ward

through and across the field Ward

through the north gate since you're

captain you get no flak from the guards

in fact they clear the crowds away so

that you could take your rickety weirdly

sort of heavyset empty wagon out and

then once you get out of the city along

the high road it's really just the first

right you take that and that road will

bear you straight to Amin's farm and you

can see it as soon as you leave the city

because you're on high ground as you

leave the north gate immense farm is a

vast encampment basically on a flat

Prairie with a bunch of tents in a strip

along one side and then the fields in

rows on the other with the barn and

other buildings nestled among those

fields there's also what appears to be

between the tents

and the fields a command building looks

like a barracks for the soldiers who

work immense for him and as you draw

nearer in your rickety wagon DF you can

see around the perimeter of admins farm

our City Guardsmen on horseback just

basically doing a very light casual

patrol around the outside to make sure

nobody hops over the fence and tries to

skedaddle ok at this point invisible

hegemon says to you now it's very

important that I find my sister as

quickly as possible you can leave the

rescue of her to me all that's important

is that I can get close to her well yes

I'm aware of what you need we'll just

just allow me to do the talking please

and don't do anything hasty or brash

don't fool it what to do I hate that

says this invisible voice we're not

gonna get along very well I don't care

just do your job yeah if you want me to

do my job you have to listen to what I

say

you're telling if you do anything stupid

just go ahead get much much worse so

this like whisper like don't worry I can

I can polymorph em it'll be fine and to

which everyone says you're talking to me

[Laughter]

all right

so yes when this road will basically hug

the west side of the fence of Amin's

farm before it heads to the barn and

other buildings but before you even get

that far a guard on horseback a woman in

her 40s late late 40s early 50s in in

her full uniform stops you with a raise

a gloved hand and says halt where are

you going

the high road is back that way I

actually will dismount from the cart

to approach her like so I can actually

like face-to-face

show her the badge city watch what

brings you here say I know I am

Geth Woodrow investigator and I'm here

just to make a couple enquiries about

some of the potential or you call them

inmates here I don't understand

I'm just here to follow up on some

possible leads and I need to just double

check on a couple of things here

paperwork wise in the life well that's

unusual

yeah it is like a deception role ah heck

six well okay let's do this if you want

to get on your wagon I'll lead you to

the commander all right much appreciate

it it's just like I did it you hop on

your little mule takes takes the cart

forward you get stuck in some mud for a

bit so the guard just sort of stops and

waits until the mule gets the wagon out

it's the wagon is so burdened and so

heavy right now that it is it is sinking

in deep ruts into the soft earth of the

road and I think we'll be able to make a

very quick getaway hegemon that says

this would be a lot

if one of you brutes got out and pushed

oh yes right away sir

as the lowest-ranking gift I will get

out and immediately begin soon as he

gets out use kind of spring up a couple

inches dear and the captain is assertive

gives you sort of arches and eyebrow as

the whole wagon heaves and then there's

a strange invisible grunt and then

suddenly the mule is kind of pushed or

knocked forward by the carriage or the

the cart as it is pushed out of the rut

keith is just like and you get it out no

problem you're you're more than strong

enough there corporal to give this thing

the heave-ho and you want to just walk

behind it at this point dude you want to

hop back in I'll keep walking behind it

and guy we get to a point where I think

I need to have leaving Cape Prince

probably in the room like I'm not

getting out I'm staying

alright they she leads you into the farm

between two fields down an aisle between

them to the barracks house and do you

make an insight check that's pretty good

that's good enough you can see as you're

now in the camp in the heart of it there

are workers in the fields I'm doing

their thing under the supervision of

guards on horseback or guards on foot as

you're making your way deeper and deeper

in the compound the guard who's leading

you is kind of giving gestures which

look like hand waves at first glance but

they're not they're too subtle she is

she is signaling and you can see that a

number of the guards in the field on

horseback and whatnot are basically

conveying her signals her hand signals

to others across the entire camp you

think that this is an alarm system ah

oh no and she's leading you right into

it

and then the gates behind your wagon

close

what's protocol here well this is

interesting because the city watch is

basically the police force in charge of

investigating crime in the city and

protecting the city with and and sort of

keeping the peace in the city the city

guard is the military in charged with

defending the walls of the city and

basically repelling forces your ass in a

City Guard outpost so your rank doesn't

exactly carry over in this environment

right and I just realize all of this

just now yes this is going very very

wrong

yeah now my dear corporal I don't wish

to alarm you but I believe our our route

of egress has been shut off it's not

very tactically sound I shall have a

which light Marauder ready sir just in

case we need to blow this entrance yes I

think that's wise but don't forget

discretion first correction exact and I

have my series X planet buster okay I'm

gonna turn I already forgot what is the

halfling same again hegemon hegemon

that's right I'm not trying to hedge

Amanda and uh wherever he is I'm gonna

turn to a blank space and start talking

okay say I don't know if this is going

to work so you need to go find your

sister right now you don't visible you

don't get a response are you here you

serve reach out and there's nothing he's

gone you looked okay no I just like I

just like I just be I'm just like okay

we've been we've been duped do I can I

can I do an insight check onto if we've

been duped sure make an inside job

that's 16

it smells like a dupe to you okay yeah

we've been duped okay so I I'd be come

visit you with that or else hegemon hit

upon that idea

shortly before you did and exercised his

right to go hunting for his sister okay

but I'm feeling the I'm feeling the

former yeah okay yeah so I uh I uh

nimble myself you can in the fence I

basically do that by attacking somebody

or casting a spell so whatever you cast

a little spell and you're invisible

yes am i invisible okay mostly I just

like maybe I'll just like turn my staff

into something and I turn it back or

something okay and I will tap on the the

top of the carriage just like try and

get Deus attention yeah you do like

they're like like I'm not whole I think

you just fear like hydrogen Mondas is

gone I'm pretty sure he was just using

us this is not particularly good for us

well he's gone so it's let's let's leave

it's just time to leave first order of

business find out charge you know go

ahead you just go yes would like me am I

still following okay she's still leading

me somewhere yeah toward a bunch of

guards we can all I mean I don't know if

I have to help him if he is using us not

very honorable and he said that word

like 15 times so right I want to stop

the cart yeah that way I can like just

keep approaching on foot soon as soon as

I like stop the cart and I like turn

around to kind of start dismount

using talkback to Strix and I'll just

say oh no stay put don't don't what yeah

this ain't like stay put they've already

sounded the alarm

yeah well she's gonna immediately open

the door and feel like oh I didn't

realize we were here already

hello what's happening strictly what are

you doing

so this this tiefling

bursts up out of this wagon the the

guard on horseback seems kind of non

plus like she was expecting something to

come out but and and just sort of stares

raises her eyebrows I we're trying to do

some research so that that maybe we

could have some see Lisa

I own a bakery a very important well

renowned bakery of the city with with my

compatriot here and we're trying to see

if maybe criminal labor might be good

for making pies that's what we're going

with huh as the okay make a back first

of all make a deception deception could

maybe make it an intimidation don't

sound very intimidating what if I looked

bad okay now it's fine

oh that's actually not bad 20 okay as

implausible as your story seems hey

pretty good she she will listen you can

see other guards sort of coming out with

hands rested on swords though none of

them have drawn weapons yet and you can

see among them

sort of emerging from the the garrison

building in the company of what you

assumed to be somebody fairly important

is an elderly halfling woman oh no with

a big stick so Rosie you received word

through your various sources mm-hmm that

a member of the family was doing

something off the grid and was going to

try to do something utterly foolish

which is break another family member out

of this camp you not only received the

message but you got to the camp in time

to talk to the commanding officer about

the situation tell that person who you

are and warn them that some tomfoolery

might go down and that you would take

care of it all right so I I walk out I

see Strix do I see you oh yeah I'm right

there making that crazy face of mine

that I don't that's my favorite Oh Rosie

I walk out I'm leaning heavily on my

staff I take in this sight and I see

Strix my my my face softens and I say hi

dear how are you are you eating John

I'll just like go and running every bug

like does kneel down like yeah so the

gift you don't know who this old

halfling woman is or why strict suddenly

feels need to throw herself at this tiny

person's feet what is this

there's Warrington from the back of the

right yes what is this I mean I mean I

mean what is this I don't know how to

make you guys visible but there's three

hippo people here and I think we were

duped by hegemon you see er I don't know

if you know hegemon but pretty sure he

lied to me no hey are you sure hegemon

yeah I think he lied to me where is he

I mean he's invisible somewhere he said

he wanted to rescue his sister from this

camp and that if I didn't do it like

mid-sentence rosy turns away from you

she goes here miss particle we have

discretion to concern ourselves with yes

okay at this point in time I need the

gift in the wagon to make a perception

check oh yes that's the nineteen oh yes

that's a seven for me okay sergeant all

right sergeant you hear something in one

of the crates with you that just sort of

goes twang and then you hear it sounds

like almost like a Rube Goldberg esque

clattering inside the crack I take out

my monocle and I peer quite gingerly

inside this fat bear it explodes alright

at this point in time the wagon just is

consumed in the biggest fireball you

have ever seen it is multicolored it's

got like purple Reds pinks yellows

oranges flames shooting out of it in all

directions the the wagon is obliterated

as its steed and I got out I need the

gift to make dexterity saving throws oh

good I was in there

no you ran and hugged Rosie I know yeah

thankfully was i far enough away from

siddik yes you're just out there just

out of the range actually you probably

close enough and you're kind of blown

off your feet yeah I imagine um like

lunch floor yes and then what did you

get on your dexterity say huh I got a 16

and I'd like to remind the dungeon

master I was walking behind that is true

find out ranking you

I seem to rule the six LA Gaston indeed

yes indeed

alright sorry I still rolling it's not

good

Rosie's hook it around four hegemon yeah

I know you're here yes tricks is just

following her being like I'm really

sorry I didn't right I was going to I

think I'm cursed I was I wasn't right

too bad she's just like telling her

stories about what a bunch of criminals

in the field see the explosion they all

sort of ducked down and many of the

guards are caught off guard as well as

this great plume of smoke arrives and

then the shower of Flinders wooden

fragments just kind of rains down upon

all of a men's farm

okay so corporal yes you take 45 points

of damage sergeant you take 90 no it's

not instant death so this this fuming

carcass basically lands with a flop and

I've made some carrots and you recognize

instantly corporal that the sergeant is

down

oh no I immediately rush over and begin

gift CPR which I assume I have some sort

of military training probably in okay

and I also start playing an emergency

song on my bugle tricks is like the

middle of like some story to Rosie like

a man this one time in it and then and

but she turns around she's like oh we

all just take a moment to really

appreciate the visualization of gift CPR

[Laughter]

okay everybody everybody roll initiative

so I know what order we're going in

relative to hegemon he's trying to avoid

Rosie so we'll start with Strix that's a

5d f88 even though you're down sergeant

what's your initiative 1717 corporal

21:21 Rosie or four and hegemon is a

blab so there we go so first thing that

happens is corporal you run over to the

chard looks light almost like just burnt

to a crisp corpse with bits of wood

stuck in his nose and in his face and in

his chest and also bits of Jesus got

smoldering powder all over him you go

over and you attempt CPR make a minute

medicine check okay

twenty there you go okay so you are able

to stabilize him immediately

yes this blackened charred corpse of

your friend mm-hmm and brother yes so

then that's an action for you you do

have some movement left if you wanted

like to drag him out of the carrots or

something like that you could do that

yeah that's I want to he ain't heavy

he's my brother like pick up yeah is or

am I still invisible at this point at

this point in time the invisibility has

ended okay cool so hippos on the field

okay great so yeah I want to pick him up

and see if I can carry him to some cover

while drawing a pistol in my other hand

okay oh god you're on full world worked

here on us yep alright at this point in

time next turn up is sergeant Ernest

thunder pakka but he has stabilized so

no deaths safe for you at the moment and

that brings us to Chris I'm also calling

out for the Commodore is so the black

you're not sure what happened to the

Commodore in the

last you're like looking around there's

like just a crater where the wagon used

to be if he is around he's either still

airborne or landed in a haystack

somewhere he was two weeks from

retirement but I should roll initiative

for him before I forget okay all right

and that brings us to hegemon now

hegemon is so Amin's farm is a big

sprawling labor camp farm hegemon is

somewhere about rosy but you're not sure

where because a little bastard was

invisible or he was you suspect hmm

what's he gonna do oh he's looking for

his sister he's already got the

distraction going so he'll do that which

brings us to DF well I would like to

stand up yes I did look at guard and

just be like I don't know what that was

I don't know what happened

you brought explosives that wasn't me

I'm pretty sure that was do not

willingly or by my knowledge you were

the driver since Trix will also be like

no but we were there was an invisible

halfling walking around named hegemon

who brought everything oh boy this is

important where is Harsha bee stinger

well before you showed up and blew

yourselves up we were in the process of

having Harsha brought to the garrison

commander I don't know why she was

merely summoned so she is probably on

our way here on our way there now in

shackles so far here I suggest you find

your

hedge oh whatever and stop him before we

do

oh no please stop him no yeah go ahead

yeah you're welcome to stop him yeah

that's fine yeah okay Harsha's not here

I guess the first thing I do is we'll

run past the explosion back towards

where the entrance the out kind of was

yeah and basically start looking for

tiny halfling footprints got it all

right make a survival check uh cowboy

mister tracker yeah six the tracks

around the cart got obliterated so you

kind of look off in a sort of a random

direction you find yourself standing

amid some cabbages and it's kind of cool

but you don't see any halfling prints

but you're looking around and the woman

on horseback says don't worry captain

the city guard has this under control

and she'll turn and start barking orders

at some other guards to find a halfling

who's not wearing shackles anything else

I should know about him

no okay he knows pretty good at magic if

you try it the name drop a bee sting on

you which brings us to Warrington who

does indeed emerge from a haystack

crawls out of it goes over reaches for

his gun and realizes it's blown to

pieces and says dog nation and he holds

it up and it breaks in half and he says

no no

[Laughter]

and then he pounds the ground Strix

you're standing next to Rosie right

who's poking the air with her stick

right um I'm like oh I didn't look

around if he's by where his sister is

maybe I can look around on my broom

that'd be faster you got any like don't

be invisible spells no I mostly just set

things on fire or turn things into

chickens if you have to spell magic you

could if you were lock has the spell

magic yeah I don't think I have that

anymore because I wanted more fire I

understand you're looking at this fuming

crater Rosie okay what I think I think

what we can do is if I get on my broom I

can definitely go find a sister and then

he's supposed to be trying to find his

sister you got room for two on that

broom I mean probably you're very small

you just go on my shoulders yes all

right so Rosie hops on now you know

sticks that this broom is really

intended to just carry one creature yeah

as you say rosie is light and actually

you find that once she hops on board

she's actually because she's like this

super monk lighter-than-air almost oh

wow yes

so she ups on you it's like a like a

feather on your back and as you take to

the sky as your broom is able to handle

the load and you launch yourself up with

a huge no I'm sorry about that I'm gonna

fix it one of these days cloud of smoke

and it backfires about 30 feet up in the

air so yeah all right keep your eyes

open and we'll just see if we can see

him or his sister I don't think there's

too many halflings here so just keep

those luck since you're skyrocketing

right away you can make them you can

both make perception checks and I'll

give you advantage for because you're

high up Wow I love rolling to threes I

think

out of 20 so great so Rosie you spot

what you assumed to be from this

distance Harsha be stinger she is a

halfling with sort of Pippi Longstocking

like hair very light-skinned and she's

being waltz in shackles through this

tent city where the prisoners are kept

when they're not working the fields um

is my guest that she deserves to be here

knowing her yes yeah she has an

insatiable love of firearms and you know

good and well that water deep is a

firearm free city that deals harsh

punishments to those who bear and or

trade in these weapons Oh sweetheart I

see her down there already do you wait

to throw you

you don't yeah I would love that

actually thank you I thought you'd never

ask

so you're just gonna like launch her off

at some point is your booming Thunder

booming overhead all right yeah I'm just

gonna be like you're gonna land you're

fine

all right you're saying it yeah you're a

lot so after a 60-foot trip through the

air Rosie you are propelled off the

broom and are you like trying to like

soften your descent cuz you're about 30

yeah the monk agile slow fall or

whatever everybody but I can do like a

cool yep landing three-point landing all

right yes so universes through is

probably terrible too so it's all up to

you all right

you land amid the two guards who are

escorting this young halfling who shoots

Rosie be stinger uh yeah hi Harsha been

a while yeah yeah to say the least

what are you doing in water tea Oh

technically I'm not in water deep I'm

know you've never been good with this

word badgering not Sam

and through the question I was selling

weapons for my brother I'm sorry where

is he I don't know is he here well

that's the rumor she's called paranoid

looking likes trying us still trying to

find window of course yep

is there any sign of him you look around

you don't see anything it's even harder

now because you're kind of in the tent

city so they're all these tents around

you blocking your line of sight okay the

good news is that if hegemon wants to

find her he's got a wend his way through

this maze of tents okay um all right

well I think the thing that I want to do

is bring Harsha out to where all of

these crazy Hitler men and Astrid yak

were that would be out in the open amid

the field so she'd be much more visible

there okay so the whole way I'm shouting

hegemon we're going back to the cart

okay as you tap your staff and you

you're amongst your you move like the

wind you can just sort of drag harsh

behind you cuz her movement is greatly

restricted by the shackles around her

ankles so she clanks and clatters and

clatters as you grab her and pull her

along and and and the whole time she's

just like apologizing to you and saying

it was her brother's idea it was her

brother's idea she was totally talked

into it I know sweetie I know okay and

and she says if there any justice he'd

be in shackles and not me that kind of

thing so you but the rest of you can see

Rosie dragging this small halfling girl

behind her oh good yeah I'm strikes is

just following up ahead so just like I

mean above Rosie keeping up the guards

in the compound are currently looking

around to see if they can see any sign

of an invisible halfling moving among

them of course some of the plants that

grow here the corn stalks and things are

even taller than a halfling is so this

is like looking for a needle in a

haystack as it were which brings us back

to you

corporal rufus derm yes

so corporal derm is uncharacteristically

passionate right now yeah this is

brother has fallen

and the mission the mission is in grave

peril - yes yes so I at this point

knowing that hegemon has set us up in a

way that has hurt my brother

I guess what is sort of the gift way

here is am i more loyal decision this is

this is a conundrum a genuine gift

conundrum because your lawful neutral

brain tells you that when you are given

orders by a superior officer you follow

those orders through without question

and to their natural conclusion so your

orders were to protect hegemon those

orders have not been rescinded they

still stand it doesn't matter what kind

of person hegemon is that's your job to

get him back to the rock of Brawl alive

that being said whatever he is done is

something he should answer for when the

mission is concluded yes so I think what

I'm gonna do is I'll find a safe place

to plop down loot sergeant pakka's body

yes I'll pull out my musket and toss it

to Warrington Mundt because I still have

my two pistols that I will go over to

Rosie and say madam is it your intention

that we take your family member alive

 though he may be I didn't

realize the gif had such a gift with

words you also figured you also forgot

just how ginormous they are if it were

up to me I would smash his face until he

looked like a collection of Strix but as

you know and so I I wonder if it is your

intention to bring him alive

so that I may fulfill my charge of

protecting him as long as he's returned

to the rock of brawl and he understands

that this is not his plane or his

judiciary then we can come to an

understanding but I need to have a word

with him first because if I see him if I

see him again anywhere into a room or

anywhere else that I might be I will not

be so generous

yes well I will not be one to get

involved in family matters as it were

yes mark is the rock a brawl at this

yeah the thing you're not supposed to

talk about okay

the next thing that happens is or the

next person's turn that comes up is

hegemon hegemon hegemon well he knows

where she is now

okay this this is so weird this belt

okay in the meantime I smolder yes you

smolder all right

Rosie hmm everybody around you suddenly

freezes like just absolutely perfectly

still like a still photograph in

whatever position and pose that they

were in you also see the smoke rising up

from the crater has also frozen like the

entire world has been caught on cool

time is up

cool cool I'm glad he knows that spell

Strix Strix is in the air just frozen

with a big trail of smoke coming up

behind her that's also frozen ok and you

seem to be the only one unaffected okay

alright beautiful well done I love it

it's great come on come on you can see

sort of rising up out of some tall

vegetables is this albino halfling in a

patchwork robe and he says this was all

a misunderstanding

is that right great so I'll explain it

to me

hedgy it was it was wrong to incarcerate

a bee stinger the family comes first

that's what I was always told that's

accurate the other thing you were always

told was stay the out of Waterdeep

wares yeah I wasn't I didn't I didn't go

to Waterdeep my sis never mind I'm not

gonna lie no no I don't think you are no

I can't do it I cannot do it I can't lie

to everybody else but if you think this

these waterworks are gonna sway me

you're wrong this is one too many times

you know what this means no no no no no

no no no no give me another chance just

one more chance I'll get it right next

time I promise I'll get it right next

time I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't know

why this got out of hand I just thought

a simple transaction of guns would not

go is horribly wrong

what have I become I become a monster oh

gosh wheat heart no you're not a monster

she gathers hegemon and scoop you've

never been a monster you're just kind of

an idiot and you are going to stay on

the rock do you understand okay can I go

home now yes and you're gonna stay there

I don't want to hear your name for at

least another 50 years and understand

can I take my sister yes thank you thank

you thank you mama bee stinger her by

any boughs and nods and he backs up and

then he goes over to his frozen sister

and as soon as he touches her the time

stop ends for everybody and everything

starts to happen again

and Harsha is surprised when she sees

her brother and the first thing she does

is she punches him in the nose it was

like no stop what took you so long

you stupid albino rat and head Germans

like I wanted to rescue you I had to

plan everything and I had to get I had

to settle up with with Argus and and

make sure that we had all the resources

necessary and she said I don't want to

hear I don't want to hear another word I

have picked carrots and cabbage and corn

and i shucked corn you know how much

shucking corn is you little Strix

from Lata's actually kind of sounds nice

and idyllic anyway they have a little

brother sister spat before hegemon

suggested they teleport away but he

can't do that till next round and she

just says some wizard you are and that

brings us to DF

what's happening you see you see a

brother/sister attacking each other yeah

yeah it's like what's happening we call

this what's its managed there's like a

certain piercing sternness in rosy voice

even D it's just like at this point in

time Warrington comes over with his tiny

musket and stands next to the sergeant

and says it's unconscious and sergeant

this is no time to be lying down on the

job

get up get up man what are you doing

just looking around when there's

business admission to a combat you get

up and at this point in time something

happens and you awaken you in Warrington

is yelling pull you up to your feet my

heart measurement where is he is right

now I trundle over towards Sam and I try

and pick him up ah my good man and I'm

lifting him at clean 8 feet off the

ground me down put me down you oh no no

my mission is to keep you safe and the

last time I let you go you've wandered

off it's this or a leash my good man you

know I think it's occurred to me maybe a

new condition on your rock I think that

these two should be your companions for

a good long time

hegemon what does this lady outrank you

[Laughter]

this wasn't the plan

I'm sorry I tried to blow you up are you

apology accepted but he's lying

yeah he duped us I blame her at this

point I guess

yes strict city searching oh I just want

Heat the mean lying wizard to leave okay

if nothing else then transpires he and

he grabs hold his sister and then only

because rosy be Snickers watching him

intercept on in this condition he holds

a hand out to the gift and says where

we're heading back now to that place we

can't talk about uh-huh

yes take me by the hand and we will go

there forthwith via magic wait are you

taking Warrington to heal or didn't he

looks at Rosie you need real warranty

needs to go home oh yes well you know I

was to help you on this mission but it

turned out I was no help whatsoever

until I have resolved that particular

debt I just assumed say with you it

sounds good to me

well then congratulations on fulfilling

your mission I'm sure the measure will

be doubly impressed when you return as a

pleasure meeting you I'm gonna take off

the bandolier of grenades and you can

gunpowder in this town and toss them to

cotton much and then stand over and I'm

going to grab the his sister and say

well she put

excuse sir I will protect you from her

and then I will grab his hand okay

then the two gif and the two halflings

teleport away great I need to tell you

what Strix means all right the the the

guards already talked bye Rosie into

releasing their charge into her care

watch as Harsha leaves and go back to

the business of dealing with the other

prisoners as he turns districts briefly

and says she like brushes some dust off

of your robe yeah there's a lot and she

says quietly quietly it's just so you

can hear she's like you never right I'm

sorry you know I have so I just have so

much to tell you and then I just get

scared and you know I'll I'll do it I

promise okay sweetie

and she looks at dad she goes I'd like

him just like this this like summer wind

and then you turn and Rosie's gone very

and yes and at that point in time the

totally yes at that point in time DF the

the guard on horseback comes over to you

and he says and she says well I don't

know what all of that was about and I

haven't pieced together all of the

information yet but you sir are a very

brave man

well we're stupid

well that time decide that one Strix

goes I'm definitely stupid dodgiest just

tries to take a moment to explain

everything actually happened yeah holla

dives profusely on his own and on behalf

of the city watch she says so what is

this brawl that they were speaking of I

have no idea

can I like our kana check that or

something no it's not an arcane thing

it's just you had you'd have to know a

bit or had to have been there well I

don't like not knowing something so now

I know that I don't know and I'm mad so

it's just you and Warrington and DF

standing amidst this prison camp and

Warrington says with his little musket

well tucks it in is belt I believe we

have done a great service here for

someone you're not sure who or what but

it was delightful to see some old

friends I don't think we've seen the

last of them Oh

Warrington what's the rock of brawl

you'll know yes well let us talk about

that over pie

shall we great yeah we're never gonna

know is there any other thing you'd like

to know about a certain meaning of a

certain name oh yeah what does Strix

mean Warrington

is that for is this a joke or I do it

mean like butt or like what is it the

three of you are having this

conversation as you're walking out he

sort of puts his big arms around you

both and just sort of walks you out with

his mind spot no go ahead go ahead

no you go ahead I was gonna say well

it's a it's a naval term that we give

use it's not very flattering but I don't

want to burden you oh my god I don't

mind being burden but pretty much all my

life it's it well since you asked so

nicely

I will tell you but don't hold it

against me it's it's an old term you

understand it's it's been in give naval

tradition for a number of years well you

know I didn't know what aspects could be

before I met you

there could be something other than the

space barnacles that grow on the

underside of some ships I mean that's um

they're resilient surviving creatures in

space that's not offensive okay if you

say so they also might cling on and

might be annoying

they are very clingy and annoying oh no

no no it is me just gets quiet Oh Strix

just a silly good thing don't worry

about it all right and you make your way

back to the city and that's where we'll

stop as an iris like closes in them yes

yes and evil and impulse enter back at

the house like where did they go this

big plume of smoke rising from outside

the city yeah all right yes I love it

when a plan comes together

my good man

I will not forget the way that you but

you and the Commodore saved my life I

consider that debt repaid yes yes indeed

well I am grateful to you always sir you

are my commander and I imagine we're

sitting on the bee stingers so that they

don't get away from us indeed all right
