hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action the show where things rarely go

right but everybody has fun anyway yeah

just like previously in dice camera

action the waffle crew set out to rescue

the waffle kids and Al and their al bear

waffles from the clutches of Joel Axel

and his sea maidens fair you know in

addition they were looking for a lost

chair

- which Jarl axel believed paltin was

emotionally attached but it turned out

not so much anywho they ended up

descending down into jail axel ship and

commandeering his submarine which was

anchored underneath his vessel hidden in

deep water Harbor things did not go

exactly as planned and the submarine

flooded forcing the waffle crew to

abandon it all the while they're being

accosted by a clockwork swordsman jarl

axles construct companion slash

bodyguard

I mean arguably that was not not the

plan it was it was a a plan in progress

but the important thing is the waffle

crew did get out strix and an

unconscious

evylyn word of recalled back to the

Waffle House with three of the waffle

children the fourth Simon opted not to

go via the spell choosing instead to

stay with pop up Alton and the two of

them were able to dimension door to the

surface and swim ashore they were going

to be accosted by some of Joel Axel's

crew until a bronze dragon intervened on

their behalf

d/f escaped using a trick that the

waffle kids had math

which is climbing into a magical diving

suit and using it hey they got four of

them inside that 1.19 suit I would say

that's mastery there sure

anyway deaath was able to flounder in

the same direction as paltin and emerge

on the beach across from the city on the

far side of deepwater Harbor so looking

at my map that would place evylyn and

Strix here and paltin and Dia here oh

that was only I only moved your hand

like a what so that's not that fun and

lest we forget earlier on the waffle

crew came into possession of mansions

black robe of the arch Magi a powerful

powerful legendary and magic item which

they took two acquisitions Inc here in

water deep in order to sell it and

negotiated a deal with the wizard

flabbergast the robe for fifty thousand

gold pieces and flabbergast said the

paperwork would be forthcoming in the

intervening time the acquisitions Inc

headquarters had a bit of a setback when

part of it exploded for more information

on that debacle see the impacts east

live sea team game Strix you are

conscious with three of the kids this is

your first after after bringing evil in

back to consciousness with your midnight

healer like should I take a spell slot

for that yeah okay I have to bring her

back to consciousness it is only then

that you realize Simon the little bugger

didn't yeah come with you I use a lot

more choice words than that and he also

realize that waffles is still missing

right

that realization is not surprising

considering the past crisis that we had

just had unfolding but I do remember

that we detected Ferdinand in one of the

other ships which means that waffles

could possibly be where Ferdinand is

possibly but as evylyn you regain

consciousness and you stare up at Strix

and you gain your bearings and you

realize oh you're back in the Waffle

House panic room you take stock of the

situation and real yeah the same thing

what happened to the submarine well Oh

doesn't help the situation

oh it just makes it ten times worse just

and I am I the only one who's losing my

audio or that reason up on us here no no

your choppy robotic yeah yeah I will

interpret that as evil and being so out

of it that she just hears the Charlie

Brown weird near we know yes yeah but

you're you're just frozen just fine but

weird things are happening at the Waffle

House can you hear me at all back ok I'm

back

yes for some reasons that my internet

was having a weird thing but yeah so

Strix just explains it and says um says

and then Simon decided to stay because

he's a big dummy to be determined but we

have to go back because we also have to

go waffles how many HP do I have did she

just stabilize me you cast the spell

healing spell I healed you

so I guess no no role role to sit how

many hit points you gave evil and back

attack

even eight I'm trying to figure out how

to go out of death safe mode in D&D

beyond oh okay long rest maybe no well

I'll figure it out but how many did you

say Holly 8 a.m. 8 ok cool thank you

I mean that was just a wake you up

God rest I can heal you for more if you

want healable

do you want healed

um no save it cuz we don't know how the

rest of everybody else is um I didn't

listen and I heal you I heard you didn't

listen and you heal me more but it

didn't hear how much so verse 17 okay 17

18 I'm gonna try and I should just try

and read that zoom woman yeah you should

reset okay we'll jump over briefly to DF

and palton you're alone on this secluded

beach and other than a big city wall on

a ridge behind you

the beach is pretty desolate there are

some docks far down the beach to your

right leading to what appears to be a

watch stronghold on this island that you

find yourselves on you're also able to

see the thin mist relax we'll ship out

in the middle of the harbor although

it's quite distant from you now and

there doesn't seem to be any activity

around it that you can detect where you

are pointing on that map we are

basically at like a side of like the

landing - water deep proper that's right

so you're down here on this Beach the

city is across the harbor

dang it and there's other than like boat

or swimming there's no easy way to get

across if you don't fly neat yep alright

and right now your sir you've got your

helmet off your big diving suit humbly I

got the big sort of puffy suit that

you're in you're standing there with

your hands on your hips yes we'll just

just kind of do this better yes so let's

take a moment all right and Simon is

with me in Bolton yeah it's the three of

you okay you see Simon he is sort of he

found what appears to be a starfish

that's washed up on the beach he's just

looking at it oh that's adorable

let him play hey Bolton how do you how

do you want to get Simon back well I

mean what are what options do we have

we just yes Simon tries to skip the

starfish across the water how's he do oh

that's funny okay well you said there

was a yeah there's a city card like

watch tower thing nearby not terribly

close but it's on they on the one end of

the island basically at the point where

the island stops and there's the the

opening between the harbor and the sea

there is a fortress there okay if we're

able to reach that I can use my city

watch status to get us passage back to

the mainland because I don't think I'm

gonna be able to swim all the way across

that mmm seems that's the only option

let's do it yeah it'd be a possible

Chris would we be able to collect

traverse this rocky eat your standard

whatever just kind of get to that watch

guard tower yeah absolutely

you make your way in that direction and

when you get there you see that it is

pretty rocky where

keep is perched on the end of the island

to watch the entrance into the harbor

you can also see at the base of it there

are worn wooden docks two of them that

extend outward and there are a number of

jetties row boats and things tethered no

big ships just smaller or driven vessels

all up and down the docks and there are

some members of the military on duty

around the keep and at the docks okay I

will just see if we can ask them

politely that we just need to get

passage back to land real real quick

yeah oh yeah let's get down there and

I'll just find someone and do the whole

thing where's like excuse me hi Keith

Woodrow captain city watch just

wondering if someone could possibly just

take me and my companions back to shore

we're back the docks we just rescued

this small child from a dangerous

kidnapping and quickly if you can the

captain doesn't have all day

yes palton sort of looking few steps

back holding the child by the hand Simon

just kind of rolls his eyes yes I know

small child who we just rescued it is I

role worthy go ahead and make a

deception check became a deception when

you lied well that's true he was

kidnapped and you didn't lie so we'll go

with persuasion hey am i doing it you

don't have to but you can eat him so he

has advantage okay cool I'll take the

eight sound I was oh there we go

twenty-two okay he says you you're given

a choice just take a boat you can roll

yourself across to one of the docks the

boat bares markings to indicate that

it's property of the city and they can

easily retrieve it or he'll take you

across himself approximately how long of

a row would it take to get from here

back to docks oh if there were two

people doing it you could probably get

across in an hour oh so like a short

rest give or take or you can't row and

rest but if you're just hanging on the

ship and not rowing you addressed could

I say that that sounds about an hour

longer than I'm willing to row so yeah

could I look request someone to a copy

us just so that when we arrived at the

docks you know we have further you know

they can vouch for us they just bring us

back we didn't steal a boat or anything

okay you hop in Simon as well and EH one

of the soldiers will step in take the

oars and start to roll you across

doesn't talk much as he as he's just

doing his thing and while that's going

on you can just kick back and spend hit

dice to regain hit points and also I

gained anything you would get back in

the short rest

yep and I would be spending said hit

dice because I am mini aus Symon says at

one point just out loud I bet sure

there's treasure down in that submarine

we should go back and take a look you

know that's a plan that we will get

there definitely into consideration

small child that we just rescued and

perhaps we can revisit that at a later

more convenient time yeah that sounds

like a possible investigation for the

city of watch and outside of our

jurisdiction aren't you captain yeah I

investigate I don't like an

investigation the captain of the ocean

oh she just called you irrelevant all

right all right back at the Waffle House

what do you do evil and Strix all right

so you got 17 more hit points yeah we

got that but I'm I'm like not quite a

fourth of my normal self that's good uh

England's even just got like she's all

cut up and soggy and you know she kind

of squishes when she walks but she's up

and ready to go that's gross okay I mean

Strix is covered in seaweed or something

I'm sure

Markham comes to the door when he hears

that you've returned and says and deaath

you can quote me on this Oh Martin

there's a visitor downstairs who's been

waiting patiently for a long time

there's four like now someone's upstairs

they've been waiting for like hours

hours I mean I got scared oh they were

down there so you know what they were

doing Martin that's not very polite to

just leave someone sitting in the living

room when you're at home you're supposed

to be watching the house well actually

actually the ghostly spectral lady who

sometimes works here but doesn't talk

very much to you basically let her in oh

okay I didn't talk to strange though is

that so dear Ned let them in great I

told her not to no I didn't I didn't

tell her anything I just told her not to

kill people all right uh Evelyn I can we

can both fly but one of us needs to go

find the others in case they need help

do you want one I don't know should we

talk to this person or get waffles or

should we rely on them I don't know why

I have decision fatigue we're very busy

today we have a very full schedule we

need to go rescue our friends so we're

going to have to walk and talk with

whoever this is okay

when you go downstairs you see walnut oh

just in time give her a big hug so

wholly dead animals right that's

entirely up to our special guest artists

so we're all not when you showed up at

the house a very pale slender elfin

figure lets you in said probably no more

than three or four words to you and told

you that the waffle crew was gone but

would probably be back in their panic

room within an hour or two you didn't

know what to make of that

but you were assured that you were you

could just wait here on the ground floor

for them to show up I've been waiting

very impatiently tapping my foot huffing

just making all kinds of judgments about

the house in general it's a mess top two

stories are burnt to a crisp they're

just black and cinders clinging to a

skeletal frame and this place hasn't

been swept in days well I like it please

excuse the mess we're in the middle of a

little renovation I'm also pretty sure

that's not frosting on that pie Oh what

is it it might be dust or mold none of

my pies are moldy I immediately hide it

like like no no this is a clean

establishment except for me oh well it's

great to see you too I'm here on

official business

oh I'm here about the acquisition of

some cloak for Jim dark magic Jim's

birthday present that we sold for 50,000

gold to a quite corporated yes uh well I

have the paperwork that's great do you

have the money uh DM do I have that much

money

No so the money has been put into a

water deep bank you have been you have

been given a letter that will that they

can present to the bank that will allow

them to access and remove the funds okay

so I let them know about that and then I

say see it's a document and it's like

having 50,000 gold it's pretty amazing

wow that seems like exactly the same

thing to me yep

well that paper says we have 50,000 gold

then we certainly do they certainly

don't not until they have signed the

triplicate contract that you have

brought and delivered the robe to you

well here's the thing well not uh we can

all do that but we have to go rescue the

other two of our party members and our

owl bear we were drowning in a submarine

and then I just left them there and

evylyn and I came here because she was

dying and the kids were dying and there

were kids in the submarine and Gerald

axel isn't that haven't you I'm really

mad that's blockwork man well it's just

like like puts a hand over her mouth and

it's like trauma whatever we need to do

to get these signatures you know as I

said here on official business and I'm

sure you know Owen wouldn't really like

if I didn't do my job

oh man have you heard from Oban how's he

doing actually he's he's uh he's great

he's doing great

um I don't really want to talk about

that right now oh okay well I mean I

understand if he asked you like not to

talk to me about him or whatever that's

fine I mean I understand anyway we

should go anyway Paulson should probably

the one to sign anyway cuz it's

technically his cloak now so great well

I love this idea of spending this much

money on a cloak for Jim dark magic so

yeah don't you think he's gonna love it

won't it be a great birthday present

yep I just can't imagine why

this authorization went through but I'm

sure it's a great cloak

you know Politan can be very persuasive

it's true Alton you're wearing the cloak

now right do you have it on yeah where

are you wearing it just for effect

we're goofing with it yeah yeah you

still in a slippers er oh right I happen

did I have the cloak with the slippers

yeah a bathrobe and slippers and wizard

cloak yep

anyway you're sort of impressed that

this this cloak dries off so quickly

it's like everything else is soaked but

that's dry I'm really impressed that

this cloak dries so quickly so it's

amazing wow that would be useful if if

it wasn't for evil people do death and

palton talk at all on their boat ride

across the harbour probably just just

like just strong silence just

occasionally no like just like every few

minutes like a random dad noise the goat

that goes on for sometimes but I feel

like at some point deaath would try to

try to say something Joe um cuz they

never get to hang out cuz there's just

like a swish yeah also for the record I

did Shore crest all of my hit dice and

am NOT back up to full go got some scars

and bruises yeah still still kind of

hurt yeah I guess the Aether's kind of

take a moment and just say I'm I'm still

sorry about your chair but I guess I'm

kind of glad I guess to to see you you

know just kind of let it go you know the

thing with the chair everyone thought I

had like such a thing for this chair and

I did but you know why the chair was

special

because you animated it cuz Navin got

clever nickname yes because I made it

special and I can make a different chair

special I can choose what's special to

me or not and I feel like there's some

kind of overlying Illustrated

illustrative like moral to that but I

don't want to piece that together right

now that's fair that's fair

so yeah so now it lies at the bottom of

the Zen an ocean Harbor just point to

flutters that notion Harbor it's in a

submarine oh wait was it was it was nice

yes but either way it's not ours we can

get a better chair just like I'm sure I

will find a better mandolin Chris ooh

nothing don't worry about it yeah I I'm

holding out faith that up bigger better

you know version 2.0 zuv all this

amazing stuff that keeps getting taken

away from me for no reason will come to

fruition yeah you know any day now

season who knows how are you doing will

hurt nice yeah you see with your keen

eyes in the direction you're facing the

sea maidens fair ships that are docked

at the Harbor are raising their sails

oh no d/f says that out loud just oh no

what so know why Oh No why is everything

always a no-no oh oh don't you remember

no fair

we still don't know where waffles is and

last we heard thanks to that locator

spell Fernet was somewhere on one sea

million fare ships look their sales are

going up there they're leaving port

right now

Keitel the the real master if we're able

to intercept and get towards those ships

or mmm how far away from the docks can

we get there first and get Simon and

tell Simon to go home and then maybe we

could admit we're back up onto the ships

and find waffles or at least try prevent

their leaving so he doesn't think that

he can row faster than those ships but

he can step up the pace to get you to

the nearest dock so that least you'll be

on land and that can he can get you

there in the next 10 minutes okay yeah

if we if we do that maybe we get up to

the ships fast enough and try to get on

there before they leave

I think waffles is trying to get laid

again oh nice Alton sorry Strix

and walnut what do you do next we have

to go come on whoa what she takes our

arm we can talk as we go

and I'm sure that um I'll be happy to

sign it if he is alive and has hands

[Laughter]

forging a signature

wink wink don't tell anyone if that is

the case uh oh we should should fly

there all night can you flock aye

you can fly right certainly yeah let's

fly there

let's all let's all fly to those ships

let's let's fly there all right turn to

a bird I tell I try to find snack I eat

it are the kids

nearby there yeah they're in the house I

tell um I assume that Martin was

standing there spying on us probably oh

I was not I was playing and not

listening everything that's fine Martin

you need to lock all the doors when we

leave don't let anyone in and tell NAT

she's in charge I'm in charge okay Matt

she's in charge okay that's in charge

yeah that's in charge I'll lock all the

doors

Jackson squiggly here that she

is just lock the doors I don't care just

lock the doors bird lady

I like the bird lady - I like when she's

a bird she was scary at first but now

she's a bird that's cool

even like instructs him to lock all the

doors and squeal he's just what about

the ceiling like the giant hole lock

that - by how do you lock the sky you

have you hear the front door slam shut

Martin if you go around to check the

doors you realize the back door or sorry

that the door to the kitchen was

actually broken open so the lock there

can't be locked I can't lock this you

like try to close it and then take like

a small collection like pots and pans

I'll keep it closed no he's getting

through that great

Willie's looking up at just the open

ceiling being told to lock it it's like

I've found my new purpose

we must lock this guy I think Jenks is

probably into that miss Lake no we can

go find some powerful magic to do it

let's do it let's go go through

strictest things no let's venture out

outside of the house and look around for

it let's find magic outside of the house

I don't trust this houses magic all

right

while the waffle kids are getting into

shenanigans strix you're on your broom

right yes Eva linear got your flying

boots and walnut is a bird of unknown

persuasion it's a hawk Oh excellent

okay so you can make excellent time as

you are soaring over the city heading

toward the dock buh-bum which will take

you about say

ten minutes you can see that the sea

maidens fair ships that were at the pier

are no longer at the pier they are all

out in the harbor converging on one

another

converging on like fighting each other

no they don't there's no indication that

there's any violence ensuing they are

just moving very very closing in on each

other moving very close to each other

do we see Deena thand paltin rowing

towards odd no well actually I'm gonna

let Walnut make a roll with her Hawkeye

visible she's hot is that perception

perception let's see I'm very good at

that

Oh Animorphs mm maybe not

ah 14 okay but you are currently a hawk

right so yeah which means I think you're

very cool I do so how do you like it 27

that's all so walnut you spot the

nefarious duo in a small boat just

coming up to one of the far piers on the

east side of the city great I fly over

to them okay and start squawking and

circling them this is lucky Hawk comes

over to you and starts tagging eyes the

two of you good you have to like a dead

fish or something in the boat or on us

just away yeah I'm pretty sure evil and

and strikes are following the hawk

that's entirely up to you just this Hawk

bothering us right now

I'll say worth you a few flaps behind ya

like so yes there's a you could throw a

dead fish at it yeah fish I had to try

and like hit it it's walnut I'm yelling

Trix is yelling about something again

spreads from that it probably has

nothing to do with this yeah just get

this hawk out of here I totally get hit

by the fish and then catch it and then

the boat and start eating it but I look

really pissed that I'm alright now it's

enough space it's not even like it's not

even chipping in for the fair should I

banish it know what you're doing you're

taming this Hawk you could have a new

Hawk then I could have a hawk yeah man

totally make up for the chair I like

bend down to the hawk I'm just like CAW

you friend we work together I turned

back into walnuts still eating the dead

fish and go oh no no no sorry

walnut yes I'm here to acquire some

great cloak get used to the land and

Strix you land but can you still be my

hawk that would be super cool I'm glad

you all lived yeah yeah us too look we

don't have a whole lot of time we don't

know where waffles is and right now the

sea Maine's fairs are getting ready to

leave if I had a hot companion the

Hawker go check on it we need to go fast

okay I'm gonna go to that that boat that

we found that we knew Ferdinand was on

and hopefully that's where waffles is

I'm gonna go talk to the captain

that's me why don't we send walnut as a

hawk to check first that is a smart

thing why why shouldn't I just go tell

them that they can't leave with our out

there what was just here for signatures

this isn't this isn't her problem they

don't know the last time this happened

it was whatever we never are stealthy

anyway go ahead

I will even chew I guess goodbye like

make the boat faster by like I don't

know which part about that's alright not

being tied off up here oh is it here

already we already made it yeah oh okay

never mind

yeah okay well if anyone can get to one

ship or fernandes if nothing else maybe

she can at least delay it strict maybe

you can check the other game or locate

spells me if you can use to help us find

waffles we're just we're just trying to

get our owl better back good be quick

umm I don't have any locate spells but I

can try and talk to them okay that's

that's something it will take a bit for

myself

so project caught up I can always call

in more few I know

evylyn as you soar over the water toward

the three ships you can see that they

have come all side by side the

Hellraiser and the heartbreaker coming

up on the sides of the eye catcher so

all three ships are now together it's at

that point that the two ships drop

anchor and you can see fortifications

start to appear around the vessels like

they are come essentially becoming

interlocked into this flotilla in the

middle of the bay transformer ships so

the eye catcher Jarl axel ship is the

middle one okay and which ship was it

was the heart breaker that the bit for

an an was on just double-check that very

quickly heartbreaker

think we should stop making people mad

um evylyn goes directly to the heart

breaker is there like a person like in

the crow's nest or anything like someone

yeah there is there is a human in the

crow's nest you can also see figures on

deck and you are actually sort of

pointed out as you approach you all are

taken off with our owl bear please stop

we need her back with your you don't

have to make a check to see this the it

looks like there's a bunch of the

members of the sea maidens fair carnies

performers colorfully dressed people all

in all people of all shapes and sizes

races that have sort of gathered on the

top deck on carlac Souls vessel and

which is very colorfully festooned and

it looks like they're having are setting

up for a dance party or something it's

got that sort of vibe you can hear

musician

playing and banquet tables being laid

out and things like that I'm sorry to

interrupt your lovely party although I

would suggest maybe not spending a whole

lot of time with there ignoring you okay

I need my alibi back they're ignoring

you and the music just gets louder

alright she lands on the heartbreaker

okay

there are as I said some carnies moving

around having fun they've already broken

out Mead and rum and are starting to get

drunk you think this is sort of like an

after parade party like they've they

finished up their business somebody's

told them that they're done in water

deep and you know it's it's time now to

party hearty no more parades just

drinking binging and copious amounts of

food and nail evylyn is all right as

soon as you land a bunch of them they

started like drape their hands over you

and they thrust the mug in your hand and

they just sort of tried to draw you into

the revelry normally evylyn would be

very amenable to this but considering

everything that's gone on she's still

kind of in I'm in no mood mode so she's

polite but she's like okay yeah all

right okay thank you

I have an author to find and she just

does that thing where like you maybe

you're in a place where you're not

supposed to be but you just take on the

persona of like I have something I'm

doing leave me alone and starts walking

toward where she thinks the owl bears

might be kept on board okay

that would be below decks certainly and

since all three of these ships are

virtually identical in terms of their

formation you can sort of find your way

down into the ship the same way you

found your way down into the eye catcher

which would take you on basically onto

the main deck and then down like see

you'll have to go two decks down at

least you think to get to what you hope

will be the Pens how she does this I'm

trying to check I don't think I had done

any lay on hands during that battle

or did I use it all no I don't think you

did I might be getting confused though

because I was catching up on games and I

caught up on the PAX East game yeah and

I used it all during that blue you blew

it all there but I don't think you've

used it in this encounter I think you're

right so evil and recognizing that she's

all alone is just gonna like give

herself a pat on the shoulder and be

like you got this and lay on hands for

like 15 okay the rest of you saw

evylyn land on the deck but she's too

far away to be heard or seen at this

point we have to get over there yeah

well the options

well can we trust Simon to get back home

on his own

ask him Simon can you go home and we'll

trust you to hold down the fort and

watch the kid I mean I know I worked for

those guys anybody maybe he can help us

this changes things he can absolutely

help us this is a great idea Simon

should totally come with us yes also

he's like 80 so like stop saying he's a

kid so he's still fragile that's true

I'll give you that Simon if it kicks you

right in the shin dear gradual now I

will take a point of damage

don't doing we do not hurt the party

Strix just laughs and as I throw darts I

don't miss those I don't I don't miss

those here's the thing we have to get

there fast walnut you can fly oh I can

only do that twice a day and I just did

that so so you got one more stir it's

just like there's like

fine no no it's fine you don't need a

day you don't use it we can we can do

something else that's fine um carry

someone in that form I could carry

my new staff at a point at my staff can

do in large reduce at will which means I

was funnier with you being tiny but

that's fair giant crocodile I'm in who

else is in great all right all right

Simon's all right so let's rocket I

almost and I'm gonna make you a giant

crocodile well double in size I hate

being told what to do and having magic

done on me and having people ride on me

diamond be respectful tell so I'm gonna

be respectful so I mean be respectful

okay we start taking off at a clip of 30

feet okay just little tail swish action

going on here I won't have you make

checks to see if you stay on long as

long as she's happy to have as long as

she's willing to tolerate your presence

you don't have to worry about falling

off of the giant crocodile as long as

Simon behaves then yes they will stay on

all right as you are making your way

across the water Strix you're taking off

there's a backfire as your broom lets

out a big black cloud of smoke every

time I'm like I thought I would have to

fix that and you are you going to try

strike so you can get there faster than

they can on the broom are you gonna try

to coincide your arrival with the

arrival of the crocodile or do you want

to get there ASAP I want to get there

ASAP and kind of just just sort of look

around I don't really want to do

anything I just look around as you soar

over the ship and people do take notice

of you you can see your way

than the crew of the sea maidens fair

there must be a hundred of them on the

deck now they've set up tables food is

being laid out you see all sorts of

pastries and jellied meats being graded

on the deck of the eye catcher

while the to supporting ships are

basically providing the music and

entertainment and all our own

shenanigans beautiful aromatic cuisine

smells coming up off the deck and lots

of drinking and laughter oh I wonder

what that's like alright so I just I

just I'll just try and like kind of an

evil and one on the one she thought that

waffles was on you have no idea where

Evelyn is oh alright she's somewhere in

the ship okay then I'll just wait for I

told you guys that I was going to the

one where Ferdinand was which was the

heart breaker the heart but you can't

see her and you don't know where she

went okay well I will identify which one

is the heart breaker easily done okay

and I will kind of just like swoop down

next to the hull mm-hm and so that they

can see me on their way over on the

crocodile and kind of just like keep

that area just I guess cuz there's

nothing I can really do except for just

wait for them to get there and wait for

Evelyn but I kind of listen and the hall

they see if I hear evil so I don't hear

any yelling or anything else is chill

there okay do I enter if I hear any like

owl bears scuffling or all you can hear

is the party the party is drowning out

absolutely everything and you think just

just part part of you senses that that's

some sort of that might be deliberate

great alright as you're making your way

across the water walnut a creature

surfaces in front of you and just stares

at you I to I and it appears to be a

dragon just brings its head up level

with yours so that its nostrils are just

above the water and you can see that

it's obviously using its wings and its

feet

to tread water in front of you and then

it opens a big mouth can i divert

directions you can if you want yeah I

don't want to go into it drinking all

right then everybody on our back make it

back steady saving throw no nobody's our

friend or she we don't know that I'll

make one for Simon 6:30 savings row yeah

all right how'd you do twenty-seven

excellent twenty-six you're all good as

waffles first started waffles as walnut

veers off none of you are shaking loose

and then the dragon says oh sorry man

I didn't mean to scare you

I just wanted to send offer you my

regards thank you and if you need a

little help with anything don't hesitate

to ask

oh yes that sounds wonderful oh um how

can we reach you well I'm here in the

harbor Oh keeping an eye on things nice

I thank you yeah and well this is as

close as I can get to the city

hmm because of the magic and whatnot

well it's okay I don't mind it's it's

overrated there anyway the briny depths

quiet down there mm-hmm

yeah there is something that that's a

mighty big crocodile you got kisses our

friend walnut oh I will not I'm Zelda

thong

so they're both scaled creatures so like

crocodiles could talk to dragons right

crocodiles have no language you are you

can't talk fine I just open and close my

mouth over and over as I don't think it

understands me this walnut oh I think

that's okay

well as elephant if possible we believe

these ships at the harbour have stolen

our pet Allah bear and we're just trying

to get him no way I know it's messed up

oh that's not nice

yeah we're just trying to make sure we

get the elder back we're not trying to

cause trouble or harm or anything we

just want to do that so if it looks like

they're trying to say make a quick

escape or bombard the city or something

right right yeah you don't want that

okay Oh also maybe thanks for saving us

when we were in that submarine and for

your trouble I've always heard how

dragon Savoy is very fond treasures and

things yeah yeah yeah very relatable if

you ever need it down towards the bottom

of the harbor in that direction

a vessel we sink it deep underwater yeah

I saw that but yeah you know it's a

little confounding because it's so small

I can't get inside it maybe you could

look into that for me we might be able

to but if if you desire it any treasures

in there you know you're welcome to oh

all right look at Thanks thank you thank

you does Trixie the dragon um since

you're watching out for your friends

yeah you do yeah you see this big dragon

treading water I go over there and I'm

like I want to spin around his head and

I'm like oh that scary lady again I'm

not scaring look you're Lucky's nephews

friendly I told you dear okay idea all

right so we're trying we're trying to

get on this bone we're trying to get

waffles right yeah okay so dragon walked

right at me

hold on better way who get to get what

we want if we show up on the dragon or

with the dragon

I agree but I'm not trying to use the

dragon like a tool well no because then

we can like look for that treasure for

him so like hits it says equivalent

exchange

what why do you decide on that they fly

it

yeah are you down telephones Elif on

Dylan sorry

apologies we make that no fixed rate now

doing a L I F a ah thank you for

spelling that in common as well if it's

if it's possible would you better say

just give us and Krakow nut just a quick

lift onto the onto the ships

well I'm debase myself by having

somebody ride on my back I would write

horrible thing they did isn't it just oh

just what is what will get you will get

you so will get you whatever treasure we

can find that song good thing if you

want to say maybe like you know roll up

with us okay ideal or just just a gentle

grip around a crocodile huh fair enough

as long as this happening out here and

the bay I can help you come over the

city but I can do it here so here I go

ready ready crocodile he looks up into

the air makes claws that you walnut and

to try to grab hold of you and suddenly

there's a big dragon clutching a giant

crocodile and a bunch of other folks and

I ride by it going I'm not scary I want

to be your friend

oh we okay um I'm telephone yo yo who

now

my name is dragged tight all I pleasure

to meet you can I come visit you

sometimes and can we have tea uh yeah

yeah and I don't I don't know that is

evil engine you're down below decks you

get to the creature pens you can see

that there are two handlers in the area

going from stall to stall carrying

buckets

food and speaking softly to the

creatures who were penned like stables

on either side and there are there are

12 stables here or all of all of which

seem to have creatures stuffed inside of

them the first one you peer into has a

pair of apes the one across from it has

weird glowing beetles each of which is

about the size of an ottoman excuse me

I'm sure there's been some kind of

mistake but I believe that you might

have my owl bear hello they will take a

look at you and say the captain took the

albear captain who that would be

captain bhishan and what does the

captain usually do with the now there

they they sort of laugh at each other

and say we we just feed the animals we

don't know what the captain does with

them where is the captain now probably

in his cabin or maybe up in the party

okay

and your shirt was my albear you know

really cute extra big and soft lady bear

really likes a throat Ripper the other

yowl bear they they laugh again and they

say oh yeah yeah I remember that al bear

uh yeah that was funny

why

and maybe you should talk to the captain

I don't like how this is going I just

want to put that out there I'm sure

you're both lovely people but the way

you're talking and laughing is very

offensive and I think you should examine

your etiquette bye bye for now

you leave the dose to the captain's

quarters well you don't know exactly

where that is but if it's anything like

Jarl axel ship they're probably upstairs

and aft that's where she goes okay when

you go back up onto the main deck you're

not sure where your friends are exactly

but you do see a big dragon in the air

holding a giant crocodile that's nice

hi guys where did you want sella foreign

to deposit this crocodile okay so for

would we be able to like I'm like asking

it's not his ell friends like could we

like fly we're flying right could we fly

up and then like you know hover a good

like maybe 50 feet ish up so everyone

gets a good view oh yeah all right but

okay cuz I got some words I have words

it's gonna be cool so evil and you can

see now that the dragon is above the

ship all the water that was sort of on

the Dragons back is sort of raining down

as it flaps its wings holding this giant

crocodile people are getting splashed

and kind of annoyed on deck and they're

yelling at the dragon yeah that dragon

is also looking for an owl bear so if

anybody knows where our owl bear is that

would be the most expedient way to get

back to your party you can see some

people on the main deck laughing shoving

food and drinking their mouths and one

of them shouts oh she wants to know

where they all bear is hahaha and why

don't you talk to the admin the Admiral

who

Admiral Zord you can manage the fleet

where is Admiral sword I'll take you

that's very kind you're brought on board

the eye catcher and taken towards Jarl

Axel's cabin I don't want to go there

you want your albear I do want my a

luxury look it's like he couldn't hear

you because there's so much music and

noise but why would I talk to the

Admiral I was just told the captain had

the albear in his quarters which is

concerning you shouldn't put an Al bear

in quarters well like no the captain

gave the albear to the Admiral okay

hey crew and and walnut and hello new

dragon friends you can't hear they can't

hear you because there's too much noise

alright she'll be like hold on one

second thank you kind escort just one

second it's gonna fly up hey yeah hey

guys it sounds like something weird is

going on with waffles they want me to

talk to Admirals or who apparently is in

Jarl Axl's quarters which is maybe not

gonna go well considering that we just

stole and sank his submarine and I don't

like him very much okay

Morey I got this I got this all right

are we really are we are we in here I

like yellow 50 feet up can you can y'all

hear me there there's lots of raucous

music drinking laughter down below they

can't really hear you can we move it a

little closer I'm gonna keep moving in

I'm gonna keep talking give me a thumbs

up when you can hear me they're not

they're paying attention to you because

this crocodile is getting rather close

to the crows nests of the three ships

maybe our dragon friend can yell really

the music gets louder and louder and

louder

what what's them where's the music

coming from from the decks of the two

outside ships musicians playing various

instruments yelling Czar yelled belting

out their tunes almost in competition

with each other at this point how far

are they would I see the musicians right

you do

you're you're probably about 40 feet up

at this point so they're probably about

50 feet away tricks don't you have a

spell that can make people louder or

softer I have that spell did you maybe

make paulten loud or them soft

I can make Paulsen loud yes make me loud

that sounds awesome

okay then I will cast Valmet er G on

paltin cool okay to make him loud can

y'all hear me now your voice carries and

you do get the attention of folks on

deck fantastic all right people of wait

what was the shift C maidens fair thank

you people of the sea maidens fair I am

palton SEPA the bar that goes hard of

water deep rider up giant crocodiles and

father of dragons and I am here to

command you to release the album and you

all may live and also 10,000 gold one of

the one of the performers who's this big

giant 700 pound man holy crap

who's was obviously a performer in the

sea maidens fair shouts up with a big

launch hey once the Alba I say we give

it to him and he holds up the hunch

thank you and there is boisterous

laughter and all kinds of capering on

deck as his booming voice probably the

only voice of magnitude comparable to

yours belts back at you and he says come

out yourself it tastes great maybe the

not our owl there and that was maybe the

other owl bear there were two where is

did you sell one I don't know they go

back to their revelry I'm gonna freakin

if you didn't know better you would say

that their behavior borders on a charm

spell

do I let's see could I try and dispel

magic on them you could what's the range

of your spell 120 feet okay and what are

you targeting exactly the dumbass is

laughing at me that's any number of

people at this point but today we're

talking about the one who shouted back

at you yeah I'm gonna target a Johnny

large man over there okay he will so

you're just trying to dispel the effect

on him when you do you see he sort of

drops his haunch and clutches his head

like he just got a sudden migraine and

he sort of topples a little bit and

falls on some people you good now

you coming to it looks like you've

cleared the cobwebs from his head I mean

something about him has changed I'm

gonna say it again we are looking for

our al bear if you are eating our al

bear we will eat you that's true I'm not

I don't know if you saw but there's

crocodiles getting very heavy we're

almost done don't worry Oh No you're on

a giant crocodile being by a dragon you

don't think that's the weirdest thing

these people have seen in the past day

still anyway but he he sort of gets back

up leaving some of his companions

reeling on the on the deck and he says I

I think we might have eaten you're out

there sorry

at this point evylyn uh just like with

the most icy calm you've ever seen

descends and slowly walks toward Jarl

Axl's cabin

so all right you can you can drop us off

on the ship hee-hee so rigging on a ship

is very very interesting because it

basically means that to to get to the

ship he might just have to drop you on

to the on to the ropes

that's my um you could with that

obviously I wouldn't move we have a

crocodile in a small child with us I

have so many hit points it's fine Simon

can probably climb onto a crow's nest

before yeah I'd rather you get low

enough to like go by a crow's nest that

we just take Simon just yeah and then

how's he gonna get down I don't care

never how are we gonna get him back and

get out of here it's okay I could fly I

could pick him up

mm-hmm he Deeks that he dips down into

the crow's nest and finds a spyglass and

starts looking around just like Isis in

the air I think I could see our house

from here nice good pen on fire is the

roof locked and then the dragon will

drop praça nut onto the deck in a place

where it's not going to crush anybody

those of you who are on its back just

make dexterity acrobatics checks to grab

hold of the rigging on the way down okay

while they're doing that can I try and

procure a piece of this meat and do a

nature check absolutely indeed I will

bear meat yeah you see a slab of meat

okay yeah 3030 whoo the two of you

easily land on the rigging and

navigating no swing your way down onto

the deck croco nut you'll end with a

loud thunk deck boards buckle and snap

under your weight and as you as you

thrash around breaking any ropes that

you have

then people just scuttled back away from

you very quickly and clear a wide area

of the deck for this dashing crocodile

I'm hissing at them if crocodiles could

scream from being carried by dragons

that noise would be happening evylyn you

do you knock well first as she descends

she she claps her hands and rubs them

together with purpose and cracks her

knuckles and that is her lay on hands on

herself she gives herself the rest so

she lays on crack knuckles how many hit

points that's gonna give her sorry

that's gonna give her 45 more so do so

she's up from 6 she's up 60 from where

she started she's at 85 out of 122 grit

and then she's also going to UM she's

gonna like stop at the door and say a

quick prayer to Lilith and ER mm-hm and

she's going to say Lord of Light please

shine upon me and help me to use that

light and to continue shining as i smite

your enemies amen and she casts or of

vitality on herself okay which is going

to allow her to heal any creature in a

how much radius a 30 foot radius 2d6 hit

points every round including herself

okay so then she kicks down the door you

pick open the door to Jarl Axl's cabin

you can see that the the drapes are

parted so that you can see the city of

Waterdeep through the beautiful bow

windows there is a feast laid out

similar to what's lay down on the deck

and you smell the same succulent aromas

here that you smelled out there and you

can see

all of the finery is put out there are

two figures in the room seated at the

table across from each other whose

laughter is not laughter who's a

repartee is broken as soon as you kick

open the door

one is the familiar figure of Jarl axel

see you did at the end of the table in

all of his purple regalia the other is

High Priestess to lastin ad Aragon of

the temple of the spires of the morning

and she is sitting there

her eyes blindfolded in a stream of

light a slant of light coming through

the window

what do I have any idea why she would be

blindfolded she's blind

yeah but why would she wear a blindfold

issues it's a ceremonial it's a

ceremonial yeah I can see it's a golden

silk blindfold covering her her eyes

evylyn upon seeing her says excuse the

interruption of priestess Jarl axel it

has come to my attention that the people

on this boat are the under the

impression that they are eating my

albear is that the case hey laughs what

if they were I would have a big problem

with that as I have a big problem with

you

as I thought that for once in my life

somebody might actually be interested in

what I had to say but I learned that in

fact that person had no interest in what

I had to say and only had interest in

using me only had interest in using my

friends and was willing to go to any

measures in order to do that in fact

such measures as drugging me and taking

a lock of my hair do you know how

disgusting you are

Kjell axle says just sort of nods and

says fort elastins benefit she is very

confused am i am i confused am i

confused by the fact that you drugged me

and brought me on to your ship and left

me in your chambers after I had no idea

what was going on am i confused by the

fact that you kidnapped my children and

told me I had no right to consider

myself a mother am i confused by the

fact that you were willing to let us die

on your ship when we tried to save them

am i confused by the fact that you

murdered someone in our home I am NOT

confused may the light of Lysander's

shine upon you in your confusion he says

there was a time many years ago when you

would talk to me like this but I just

blew it off as the frustrations of a

young girl looking for some purpose in

life until of course I directed you on

your course into the warm embrace of

their church the Sun a place I always

thought you almost welcomed a place nor

home to you than home itself I knew your

father he was a good man and when he

left us on one of his adventures

I'd like to visit once in a while are

you trying to imply that I know you

because I most certainly do not

I hope to raise you my dear no more lies

I'm done this is no lie I say this in

all honesty before they have priestess

of Athena herself and till Aston says my

dear I'm sorry that it had to be

reviewed like this but Joel axel has a

history with our church and with your

family and we owe him for all of the

service that he has rendered in the

donations that he I'm sorry I understand

that you are a high priestess and you're

the one who is supposed to be the one

who's allowed to speak which is my

moment to speak this is a moment and I

have a big Alaskan stands up and

silences you

and then she sits back down the rest of

you out on the deck

a silence spell washes out from Jarl

Axl's quarters not only engulfing the

quarters but also several other people

you just see people on deck now animated

but not making any sound I'm gonna turn

back into myself are we under the

effects of silence no you're outside the

area um so I look at death and well it's

like obviously really shaken and she's

like look I have no idea what's going on

here and I don't know why I came out to

this boat cuz all I need is the

signature I got very swept up in this

whole thing but I just need your

signatures and I'm gonna be on my way I

don't I don't want any part of dragons I

want part of people being silenced I

look at death and I'm like just I need

your signatures that's it I agree with

you I'm so sorry about this

I'm so sorry you should now got him

roped up into this and it's not fair to

you and this isn't your problem

yes oh my god and she's like really

taken aback that somebody would like not

fight her well I guess you know since

I'm already here I guess I could you

know I could I could help uh here and uh

I'll cast a spell magic at the the

silence goes away she says tada

and Yvonne's still talking so we we hear

at this point oh you can hear her yes

does this look like

evylyn just brushed off this silence

well it could have could have easily

been mistaken for that and then she just

keeps talking but yes the silent spell

was enough to shock a number of people

on the deck to be it stopped the music

so you can actually hear evylyn now

going off yeah so now hearing that I

feel like all of us are pre urgently

wanting to go there and as a single step

in that direction he'll turn and look

back at wallet and just say

you have no business here this is not

your fight but this is something that we

have to take care of if you want to

postpone the signature just means back

on shore or back at our house we can do

that but I'm sorry I'm we have to go we

gotta go like he said if you want just

enjoy the party just just hang out here

yeah there's a party don't help I'm not

letting you out of my sight until I get

those signatures and I deal with this

whole cloak situation so let's let's go

let's wrap this up real quick who's ever

she's in there yelling at and then we'll

we'll just get these signatures okay

just stay safe um

and relax all turns to two lastin and

says I have double unit with their acts

and this is how she treats me it's

appalling is what I've come to expect so

young so yeah I turned to last in as

soon as that whole episode happens and

I'm like no priestess fully bathed in

light of Lysander would silence one who

merely wants to defend themselves or

express themselves you do not have to

you do not know how to behave in this

company one of the many lessons you have

failed to learn I will have to

re-educate you I am through learning I

am through learning lessons from people

like you too and even grabs

jarl Axl by the collar and attempts to

haul him out of the cabin make an attack

roll oh I forgot guys hold on what when

it is appropriate yes

man I like just try and kick the door in

the door has already been kicked in um

you know I like shut it and then yes you

close it and then you kick it in again

for this role

is it just like actually since you're

trying to grab make a strength oolitic

strength okay or just just take whatever

role you have and apply your acrobatics

or sir your athletics bonus uh no it's

not very good

twelve no he slips out of your grasp and

I take stands up and just sort of puts

the chair between you and him

in fact he holds it almost like a person

would hold the chair to hold back a lion

nice sorry I interrupted Paulson no is

false in trying to stall him closed the

door and then kicked it open again so

you're all sort of pile into the room

you can see priestess to last an ad

Eragon now standing along with Jarl Axl

well I'm just marches in like sub

 we throw in fisticuffs what's

going on whoa we're not here to fight

we're always trying to get our all their

backs where we can be done here but girl

Axl's here I know I hate him just as

much as you do yes isn't he I'm not

looking to see if this is owl bear meat

but I only rolled an eight uh you're

actually you don't even have to roll you

know it's al bear meat okay we've eaten

hollow bear yeah I'm familiar with it so

peace man over yeah with us write what

you know yeah well that is with you just

like what wall have you met your like

soul

oh he will you will put the chair down

and slither over to you

walnut do I get a pack of opportunity no

yes I do no you don't just like well

this is Jarrell Axl he's literal gives

he is disengaging from you as a bonus

action and moving over to walnut and

trying to take her by the hand

every time you tries to grab it well nut

just slides or hey Lee

yeah aren't his hands like eerily clammy

too like how easy was that slide right

it's gross he said

of course we did not need your Albea i

have your l bel safe and sound i'll be

happy to return her to you once you have

brought me my stone yeah he's got a

thing for stones i don't know what he

does with them i don't know where he

puts them but i mean he's super hype

dogs non bounce around and if you have

any i would be impressed but I'm not

talking to you I'm talking to how walnut

has a lump of citrine in her pocket oh

[Laughter]

that's very nice that is a lovely stone

well did you find it um no just out on

the long road someone you see Joel

actual has turned out everybody else in

the room except the walnut well it's

like yeah I just found it do it again

Bhama

so evil you're so evil I noticed you

don't do that to me because I'm gonna

bite you I don't know he seems okay a

little handsy seems fine not we have had

some difficult dealings with him in the

past you should pay there no attention I

am harmless I swear

well they are difficult people do you

smile backs over there that she holds

it's a beautiful eyes don't you think I

was the one who helped get it for her

this is the gratitude she shows me that

don't that wasn't how do you

socialize with these people I mean they

also food well this is more like of a

business interaction evylyn there's

nothing something yeah evil looks so

betrayed your mouth just drops open if

you will if you will to make a wish I

would have to fulfill it my dear your

beauty surpasses the earth itself no no

it's as soon as she hears that she goes

oh whoa whoa whoa the earth no no no no

no no I don't want any of what you're

selling never mind no look if I may I

think relax wills actually right here

and you're correct as well this Evelyn's

mouth again this is

this is a business interaction yes we

need to negotiate for the return of our

owl bear we don't negotiate for anything

we'll kill that our children he

kidnapped our albear he's a sack

reserved your children safe guard them

from irresponsible parenting and that is

all she looks right at the earth right

in the eyes and she goes what am i what

sort of parent sends sends their

children to it to a strange fair

unsupervised

it looks at death and it's like tell me

if I'm being gas-lit right now or tell

me if I'm crazy evil and I only ask

right now that we to last and says

you're crazy you should return to the

temple at once and convey her Lathon

does forgiveness can I try a banished

her yeah cool that's a this is like I

I'm sick of this whole thing she has to

make a wisdom save charisma charisma

what's the DC 20 oh ho I see my my my

Kate's comment to me chap was just why

don't you banish the whole world

Superman all right

High Priestess tellus tinted Aragon of

the spires of the morning is banished

yeah we're gonna get in a lot of trouble

for that good that best should give us

some breathing room walnut we have an

interaction business transaction that we

need to do and I humbly request your

skills to help us write a contract to

help make sure both parties get exactly

what they want the table is already

filled with documents there's quills out

there's a Ledge drought there's like

carbon copies have somehow been invented

and those are out and should you know

and it should mediation be required you

know we can step out for a little bit to

help negotiate the terms on either side

to help make sure we both good we want

we have no need for bloodshed or

fighting or anything like that we can do

this peacefully and legally I say that

like almost partly a tri-axial

Jerell axle just kind of rolls his eyes

a little bit and then but before walnut'

can actually see him do it he a sort of

levels his gaze at her and says of

course of course yes see that did an eye

roll he didn't like it didn't what I

figured it best at a neutral third party

would be the best tube and what a lovely

a neutral third party

yeah I equally just like everyone in

this room we are friends a little man

after the holidays - she's a tough nut

to crack all right so what did the tail

Mizar these arrangements well I figure

it'd be best and easiest if perhaps the

four of us can step out you can address

your terms to walnut well come to us

here are terms negotiate back and forth

and then create a contract in such a way

that we both get as much as you want

with as much compromise as we both see

reasonable I trust implicitly ah yeah

right I so if that's that's all right

everyone you forget just step out for a

moment and let them try to negotiate and

we'll all stick a breather so we'll sort

of push some food aside and sit on the

all right Paul didn't evil in Strix just

take a moment and we'll try to talk

about what we need great leave me alone

with them sounds good yeah we'll be will

be very nearby alright

evylyn was like screaming you know and

like looking around making this big

scene and then as soon as deaath like

looked at her and did this she assumed

that meant like I have a plan trust me

and so she is not what we convinced or

happy about it but she's basically

lapsed into this Isis like military

silence like you can see she's moving

the way that you would when you've had

something drilled into you so long by

rote she's just in full like soldier

ready mode and not participating at all

yeah walnut even you can see he just

pulls out a couple dabs of perfume and

put some behind his ears and puts it

away and tucks it into a a cuff and he

then leans over legs crossed and looks

at the all the paperwork you've got

splayed out on the table and says all I

want is the stone of galore it is a

magic item that knows the location of a

secret 12 of gold hidden somewhere

around the city they know how to get it

they know who has it once they bring it

to me I will return their property to

them alive oh hey that sounds like a

pretty good Rock and they already know

that you want this and they're unwilling

to give it to you correct they're trying

to get something for nothing I believe

is the expression um okay well I mean I

want to do this legally but of Clare

albear seems like it was stolen so I

don't know actually the album was

delivered to us oh well I didn't know

that huh

we of course taking care of it well I

wasn't delivered how was it possible she

doesn't know the room well I say on the

room I felt oh she says like well

alright this sounds like pretty

cut-and-dry I'll go to them and see if

we can wrap this up I know you can gross

okay cool

and she walks out of the room but she

doesn't like want to put her back to him

cuz she's really grossed out by him so

she just kind of like backs out yeah he

just sort of looking at that you know

look one of the quills that you broke

out and just sort of absently admiring

it while you step out um so well Mike

goes out and addresses the waffle career

and just is like yeah he just needs that

fancy rock and he's happy to give back

the albear so did he touch you did he

put anything on you did you use it cm

Hughes use any kind of alchemy

or anything while you're alone if you

offer you a drink

he was just drowning himself in perfume

evylyn yes the perfume was that you have

any recollection about that Chris when I

spilled it all I remember there was

something to that have it having to do

with like I felt like it had a charm

effect yeah you felt like it was it

might have lulled you into some sort of

torpor or state the perfume is drugged

great well it doesn't seem to me I don't

feel like it has an effect on me right

as of right now or do I

you don't believe so but some of that

may have something to do with your

heritage oh hey good point you're right

thanks thanks for reminding I go oh yeah

that stuff doesn't work on me okay are

only terms is that through this contract

it'll state that he returns waffles to

us immediately and we could to leave

with her all four of us get to leave

Simon gets to leave and he leaves us

alone perhaps even a sort of no no

restraining order that's a thing it's

possible we know he wants to stone which

we don't have by the way which we never

did but you know how to get it right not

the same way that someone knows how to

get a moon rock like certainly someone

could something but that doesn't give

you the excuse to steal someone's owl

bear I mean I don't know maybe I'm the

crazy one well he's under the impression

that it was delivered yeah the same way

that a child is delivered to someone who

happens to take their hand at the market

it would only be delivered if someone

stole waffles nobody's like if he were

to ask someone to steal it and then

bring it to him then sure it was

delivered oh okay all right I see what's

going on Han let me go back in there

okay um so I go back in there and when

you do they priestess the drow

priestess what the blindfold is back oh

yeah in the room and she goes all right

 listen you're not being straight

with me this is a this is a sacred

ritual we're trying to conduct

negotiations here here's what they want

to do they want to get their albear back

and what if I could get you the

information on how to get the stone not

gonna give you the stone you can go

through the trouble of getting that out

but you know where the stone is I need

them to get it for me ah walnut just

sees that this is going in circles she

kind of like you know just takes a

second and she goes you can't get the

snown yourself why not politics politics

politics oh but you seem very

influential are you trying to seduce me

my dear and you see till Aston actually

come over at that point and sort of

interject herself and say I did not come

here to be part of this negotiation and

she sort of lays a hand on your hand on

the back of your hand walnut and she's

there's something that she's pawned in

her hand that she is trying to hand off

to you without Jarl Axl noticing oh I

will so do a sleight-of-hand check if

you would like Lee's please big money

dad 20 yeah she had she hadn't she palms

you a ring with a sparkling gem set into

it and just lets you sort of slide it on

into your into your hand without anyone

none the wiser and then she puts two

hands on Doyle Axl and just says perhaps

when cooler heads

failed we can all meet the game until

then let's enjoy the party let's enjoy

the sunlight that Lysander has blessed

us with on this day and send these

people on their way

Jackson says oh my dear we've known each

other too long for you to pull that one

over on me

um while they're talking I put the ring

on like behind my back okay you can see

that they're having their their

conversation

this and then he says I just want to

everybody to be happy

I want I want me to be happy with my

with my stone that I deserve and I want

them to be happy with our success and

they were adventuring courier and their

little owl barrels and little friends

and all of that ridiculous things that

they do and of course I want you to be

happy whatever you wish I want this

transaction to be a memorable one for

you great wonderful uh okay I uh rest in

this part no you play with me don't feel

anything happened when I put on the ring

no no okay great it's just a cool ring

I'm like very disappointed by this

because I don't like shiny stuff um so I

look at relics a lot and I go um I don't

I don't think they're gonna get you this

stone is there anything else you want

from them no not particularly other than

maybe some decency and some you know

kind words for all the great things I

had done for them great okay fine let me

what is the world a recognition perhaps

let me talk to them one more time please

I go back out and I say he really wants

a stone alright

well I am fully aware of your skills as

a document sir and if it's possible

walnut you language this contract

business deal in such a way that will

state yes we're going to give him that

stone but maybe not the real one maybe

we can make a different one

well no it'll be the real one no fakes

no counterfeit or anything like that but

use such language to help kind of

disguise the fact that he's gonna get

that stone after we're done using it

okay

so I'll get the stone in an

indeterminate amount of time yes because

who knows when we'll get it I'm reading

you loud and clear hold up that part of

the deal but it's just really important

that he not get that stone before anyone

else so we'll retrieve it to him in just

give me a time just use your words use

that power that I know you have yes this

I can absolutely do he's just not

budging it's it's very awful it's

terrible to deal with fair so again

we'll get him the stone okay as soon as

we can

ask-ask yep well what contract that and

make that a guarantee or something some

Kearney is just like eating candy floss

and listening to your conversation about

five feet away I'm just gonna hit them

they don't paste and just just know that

elf likes whisper then geez I just

looked at them I'm just like there's

there's free there's more free of that

cotton candy on the other side both they

look over where you're pointing and

wonder off yeah just I I'm sorry I'm not

no I'm asking more of you walnut and I'm

so sorry but we just need this it's for

the safety and good of a lot of people

oh no it's fine I love paperwork this is

great this is a treat for me I'm glad um

so I go back in and I say

alright here's what we're gonna do

you're gonna release the albear

immediately and they are gonna bring you

the stone and they will be contractually

obligated and I don't know if you know

these are just not normal contracts

these are special magical contracts so

they will have to do it you see the

priestess give an awkward cough yeah

yeah well that's like look looks at her

like yeah I got this ring that doesn't

do anything like Markab Lisa V this

arrangement I believe maybe if you vouch

for them I can touch them once more to

make good on this one singular promise

and of course I would expect them to try

to utilize this stone in their own

fashion before giving it over to me that

was always part of the plan exactly

perfectly reasonable yes exactly

um while it sorry traffic never a

document my dear did the wine go down

the long way and the dying priestess

says no it's fine I will just sit here

and watch my plans unravel before my

[Music]

walnut is hunched over the table

drafting up this document

she looks again at the ring and like can

I do like can I do some kind of

something just like identify this thing

or like know anything about it like you

can make a Nakano check oh great well

I'm very good at draped over the back of

his gaudy chair and begins rifling

through a pocket um I go over and I let

the uh I'm gonna let the waffle crew in

because I'm at the point now where like

I'm already drafting up this document so

it's happening yeah all right

you can see by the ones you guys enter

Jarl axel is got a mild look of concern

on his face as he's digging through the

pockets of his overcoat walnut brings

well it makes a motion towards Strix and

goes oh can you help me with this

wording real quick wow that's nice of

you to ask I'm not really good at that

uh-huh yeah great come here for a second

she whispers she's like she's like I got

this ring what that does it do I don't

know I'll take it okay

well it's on her hand so you just have

her hand okay I just hold your hand very

softly just does go that's so nice and

both hands just take it off and like it

just goes into my ropes like a

sleight-of-hand check great can't you

just our can to check from looking at it

you can do that too I'm gonna do

something that I'm going to ask for

advantage and I pretend to eat it pop

anything about yeah I feel like that's

such a common thing for Strix that I

should manage sure yes okay yeah okay

haha that's a 17 okay and you can see

this whole time the blind priestess is

just it's almost like she can see what

you're doing because she just sort of

goes and jhalak so says well everything

is fine how is how how's the writing

coming is the contract almost prepared

oh yeah she's still fishing through his

jacket um

walnuts starts trying to price tricks

his mouth up and she goes hey um Sean

Astin says I need to talk have a private

word with Avilan and she gets up and

grabs

evylyn by the arm and tries to pull her

out of the cabin evylyn immediately

grabs her arm back and says you have no

sway over me whoa

she says if you don't come out with me

right now we will all die evylyn rolls

her eyes and is like I'll be right back

and follows her out as soon as you get

outside she turns to you and says I am

NOT the last an otaku who are I have

given wrong at the ring that holds you a

little magical albear friend the

outdoors in a ring yes jhalak said put

it out

am I getting gas lighted again I'm I'm

exhausted from trying to think when

people are lying to me have you been out

in the Sun too long

just get the ring and get out of here

quickly who are you she says my name is

Lara Silva and I am the open Lord of

Waterdeep can I in sight check whether I

think that this is true

sure it did do I get a 16 that's it I

mean waddle of all the crazy lies

pretending to be the open Lord of water

how silly is that but there is a

sincerity in the way she's looking at

you right now and says I have kept

abreast of captain woodrose efforts to

try to deal with this matter and I only

want to help you well what could it hurt

you said you gave it to Strix no.22

walnut all right so we don't need to

sign the contract and this folks put it

in Hellmouth oh well that does sound

true I guess you don't know that you

don't want to sign a contract with him

oh okay um great well I never wanted to

sign that contract anyway so sounds good

everyone everything that you said I

could not be happier to have heard those

words after to his face

few would dare do such a thing you're a

very brave girl this is very confusing

for even having heard her high priest

say you are sinful and should pray for

forgiveness and now the same face is

saying like

you've said the right thing so she's

like thank you much time yeah you're

right

does he even have any way to make fire

immediately fire uh cuz I don't think

she has any kind of spell you know

you're someone you don't have your sword

with you oh oh I guess yeah yeah I guess

you still have it on you yeah II was

just gonna walk in move on let's hand

and smack the flame sword down across

all the paper screams cool no contract

no dice we have what we have waffles

it's fine goodbye forever Jarl Axl may

the morning lord have mercy on your soul

or may I kill you later goodbye yeah

wait we have waffles you also see well

yes if you like sorry well not except

you don't really like me anyway so I

guess it doesn't matter she walks out we

still have to sign the contract for the

pros the contracts on fire that contract

but there's another contract yes that's

safely hidden away I storm out after

evylyn and I go I can't believe that you

did that and also I do like you but just

could you about it oh that's so silly if

we all run outside i i'd i like spit the

ring into my hand and go key if i don't

know what this is here evylyn snatches

it and she's like it's waffles waffles

is in the ring I'll say as everyone

knows like Mikey used to it's the last

one and he's just like will sign a

contract to have it sent to you I don't

know I'm so sorry now I had something

something something

you're an we'll kill you later

see you evylyn holds up the ring to

Strix and she's like quick Arcana check

this find out if a an owl bear could be

inside it when you hold it up to your

eye they're evil and you see really

closely you can see waffles inside the

tiny little

sort of pawing at that pond I do my

mouth for safety a tiny door is like

like in a tiny little bubble oh well I

sort of measured it as reduced size

albear with enough room to move around

not like crushed inside this tiny space

well oh they're all looking at the ring

I'm gonna look over the balcony of the

ship and go dead dragon help what was

his name again G if I was his name o

Zama thorn Bela fire dolla fire Barney

Barney Barney make sure to get right and

I yell over the lake and say we just

need one more favor if you don't mind

the dragon will having having after

dropping you down to dive down into the

water but he's actually kind of perched

on the front of the ship he just sort of

crawls up on to the bow onto the

forecastle just hold out fast like my

guy pushes you across the deck I look

around and I go one two walnut one all

right

I'm gonna make everyone tiny then we're

you'll all fit on the dragon and you can

well even can fly so well everyone who

can't fly is gonna be tiny on the dragon

that way you don't have to burden him at

all do we do I see Simon still up in the

crow's nest yeah okay so I would we'll

be right there

ah well then I'm real sorry about

burning your papers I know they're very

important to you but I didn't want to be

in a contract with him I'm sorry

oh I wouldn't want you to either it was

not going well not my best work

well now it's gone so we need Simon and

I don't think self are and is

comfortable with anyone actually writing

him

you made that pretty clear earlier you

can carry um we can just get up on his

feet yeah you'll be snobby Saul at least

three of you can fit on a few feet so

feets far away are you from shore Tris

oh you're about a thousand yards oh I

thought we just take the boat that means

you straight forward and out of

character I mean like this boat like

this could be our boat oh I want a boat

is this the boat with Durrell axel on it

yeah eat him off the boat yeah no no

we're not taking the boat this is crazy

we need to know ho when we did we need

to get waffles back before Charlotte

comes out here and stabs us I don't

think we need to steal a boat we just

went through very poor negotiations and

before drill Axl realized what happened

to his ring we need to get out of here I

agree a dragon everyone is now suddenly

Chucky how many creatures new effect

with that as it's at will for my staff

well how many creatures can you affect

at once because you have to cast it

multiple times then okay

yeah yeah so it's one a creature yeah

one creature who fuss home spell I used

that that one's gone that's uh

so you actually use that in a couple

things so you're zapping a number of

people in order to shrink them down

while you're counting the seconds until

Jarl axel realizes he's been pinched yes

so wait Zack I've come down to tiny and

I'm like okay you're all Simon sighs now

look how cute you are look at you and I

paddle their heads and I know now climb

on to why do I always forget dragons

names gnome God that was born climb on

to his feets and we're gonna fly out of

here me and evylyn let's go it's a

little tiny get me out of here

Joel axel comes out then after you've

shrunk down paltin and DF and walnut but

before the dragon has gotten

to you I'll step to him I'll stand in

front of them between him and them okay

it's at that point in time when gsella

farn

comes barging from the front part of the

ship toward the back sending people

scuttling basically creating the world's

biggest distraction even just smiles as

a dragon reporter yes yes and you see

that Zell farm gets tangled up in the

rigging and just starts tearing it all

up ripping it to shreds but it does kind

of it slows him down a bit but not

necessarily in a bad way he actually

looks him even more fearsome and starts

to roar loudly causing everybody to

scatter you see Jarl axel just very just

pulls out his blade very slowly

and just stands there waiting for the

dragon to come to him and not a hint of

fear in his face in fact he smiles at

the opportunity to kill it

what do the rest of you do it's time to

go

yeah where they gotta fight so they

think they're gonna fight do not let

them fight yeah

DF is really tiny and well you know he's

pretty dinky tricky dicky deaaath and

shrinky-dinky palton could you guys

please get on the dragon so we can all

leave I'm holding off trial axel here

yeah that's right oh yeah yeah yeah I

get on but uh she's really freaked out

now okay I just got on the dragon okay

then the dragon will alight and deny

drawback solo showdown everyone will

even we'll also as the dragon takes off

she'll also take off and she'll make

some sort of like Lysander blessing

gesture but in like the most

condescending way possible like it reads

like she's flipping him off but it's

actually a blessing and Paul's gonna

like mimic it just like a alright I'll

be sure to point to Simon to make sure

we think I'm up before we go I kind of

looked at that group and I'm like should

I fire above the ship

it is containing a very evil kidnapper

it seems like that would be a good thing

to do in service of the city wouldn't it

captain Woodrow I mean there's also a

lot of innocent entertainers on there

and I don't know if it's a good idea to

further antagonize them fire goes away

not yet however paltin you could

probably steal this flag yeah all right

you see you liked it

yep oh why you ain't gettin like tie it

around as a cape

all right you've got a purple flag cape

they're like popped collars of your

outfit mm-hmm okay and the dragon will

bear you as close to the shores it can

but it can't get very close and it tells

you that so it just drops you in the

water yeah close enough for us to swim

to shore

yeah flourish or dimension or whatever

yeah you get to shore sopping wet

standing on the pier before I want to

get I want to give him a present I want

to give the dragon a present I only have

like us probably like a soggy pie but I

tell him that he that I can bring him

fresh pies applies he looks at this

infinitesimally small soggy wet pie and

he just sort of picks it up very

delicately it's just Thank You pops it

yeah and then he dives in the water

house done by a friend Oh are we big or

are we tiny in the water you can get big

you're big now okay great you crawl back

out your full-size sopping wet standing

at the dock

perfect okay can we just go home

finalize this sale yes

evylyn also wants to hug Simon

specifically same Oh family okay and

then you head home yeah

cut to a scene with somebody's signature

on a piece of paper I guess that would

be Paul Toombs finally you have got all

three copies which means you can take

custody of the black cloak and give them

the piece of paper so that they can

access their funds hey hey oh my god I'm

so happy I'm sorry that that was so

difficult

I'm wish it was more straightforward but

that's like what you kind of probably

expect when you come to our house isn't

it

it is Tuesday's so yep so now you get

this beautiful this beautifully written

gold foiled letter to present to the

bank to authenticate your ownership of

the money stored within yeah I hope at

some point we can meet just under

pleasant circumstances things are normal

we did we all had Christmas and that's

the time the walnut gave me that owl

bear pie and it was really sad I said

normal yeah don't come by for the

holidays it's a stressful time well well

look before you go there's someone other

thing I need to take care of with you

okay Diaz will step away from moments go

down into the basement rifle around in

one of his other hidden compartments and

return upstairs to walnut in hand her a

familiar sack of six hundred gold pieces

oh my god she goes I'm gonna be honest I

didn't think we were ever getting this

back oh I'm sorry it took so long is I

know as part of the deal and I would've

got there sooner it's just a lot of

things have been I've been taking our

attention yeah tell me about it my whole

company blew up anyway thanks for this

goal this is great you're a man of your

word and I won't forget that

yeah she takes her leave bye walnut tell

oh man we said hi if he wants to tell

Jim he's a bad wizard I will do that

so did you want to read that contract

before you signed it

hey everybody read it yeah okay okay

what's it all about the board yeah so

walnut it's all above the board walnut

has got now the cloak and is taking it

back to acquisitions Inc and you guys

have the letter for the bank do you want

to leave them wait now we have 50,000

goals we can because in the bank account

waiting to be taken out is it Bank I

mean tiefling lady right no that's the

castle enter bank now okay that's what I

was worried about all right well let's

go get all the money we need for the

Renault okay so we all go as a group

family walks out yeah we oh we should do

that first let's leave the money where

it's safe until we're ready to use it

yep

making our common check for the ring 18

you can either cast it tried to cast the

dispel magic on the ring or you can

break it either should read all either

should free the hell they're all right

oh I was feeling breaking tonight but

I'm actually gonna hand it to evil in me

evil and you can just break it if you

want to get some anger out

it is Jarl Axl's I don't want to crash

little little waffles do I have a sense

that it was just really fine I know

magic do I get a sense that it could do

her any damage Chris or not a check I

already checked you don't believe me

she's just worried Meyer kind of check

is fifteen understandable you don't

believe you trusts tricks and you you

believe that it seems like as good a way

as I need to free revolver all right

well this is what I think of you Jarl

axel and she like lines it up on

like she wedges it into like a crack in

the table she takes alls she she's like

I would I would never

and then she uses her axe and she tries

to like the side of the axe just

directly on the stone she's doing like a

trick shot just to show off okay you hit

it nice big flash of light and walk

lives on the table and that's a real

pickup next week all right we are at a

time but I wanted to thank first and
