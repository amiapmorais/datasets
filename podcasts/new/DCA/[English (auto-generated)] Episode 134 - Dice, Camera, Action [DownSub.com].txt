hi everybody and welcome to the angry

beavers no that was by Envirothon team

high school girls and no one told us it

was bad the end great this is a great

here in the cozy not together

previously on angry be the waffle crew

went to an auction and stole the stone

of gholar before it could be auctioned

off and then they word of recalled back

to their house and promptly found

themselves at odds with various servants

of auctioneers who feel like they were

cheated various indeed yes so the

Sentara is represented the castle enters

are represented and even Jarl Axl's

Bragan dareth drow are represented as

they all attack to the Waffle House at

once oh and we ended last week's session

by having just about everybody who's

anybody fighting on the first and second

floors arrows coming magically through

the walls of the Waffle House struck the

earth but struck palton even harder

taking him down actually no wasn't was

it the arrows that took you down or

wasn't the imps I don't know man it was

alive anyway yeah it was the arrows were

bad the arrows hurt a lot but the imps

had their poison palton hit the floor in

the upstairs hallway followed soon

thereafter by his son Simon who was also

stung by the imps after bashing one of

their little heads up against a wall

evylyn is doing a perpetual dance having

had a spell having had a spell cast upon

her last week that forced her to do the

morning lord of the dance

[Laughter]

I forgot about that and it made me laugh

and spill tea strix DF and the black

Viper all downstairs with the kids

fighting growl and the last thing that

happened was a bunch of rubbery black

tentacles erupted from the floor of the

tap room basically almost filling the

entire room threatening to wrap everyone

up in their clutches sister Rui you are

not there nope

you left this giant statue with

buildings built atop it and started

running through the streets in the

middle of the night heading to the

Waffle House and you don't have to make

any sort of check - no sorry I'm just

getting my bearings here where is the

god catcher there it is so you are one

two three four five about six blocks

away from troll skull alley when you

leave the god catcher and when you get

now the fastest way to get there is just

to charge down Jolson's street heading

east until you get to the high road then

follow the high road north to Dells Oran

Street but when you get to the high road

and you're expecting this being the

middle of the night there shouldn't be

too much activity in the city yeah I'm

gonna run crosswalks you realize that

there is a night parade basically

filling up the high road making its way

slowly northward and you can see that

there are colorfully dressed individuals

in the parade some of them on stilts at

least one of them writing what looks

like a white ox you can see jugglers you

can see torch jugglers and you can see

very scantily clad men and women with

sequined outfits and leashes with

various animals but they're pulling

behind them including exotic beasts such

as camels and other things that you

haven't really seen before in this part

of the world

top of that you can see that there are

crowds gathering all along the sides of

the road with drinks and beverages yeah

so it's pride or carnival it's it could

be all of the above yes okay so if all

right so it's basically it's blocking

the way it is now someone of your

abilities with your your stealth and

whatnot could probably slip through the

menagerie to get across the street if

you so west I would totally be down to

troll for that wait for a for a gap in

the parade where there aren't too many

things that could trample me and then

Mariah will try and dart into the into

the midst of the parade well you know in

preferably around something that will

draw interest rather than the small dark

figure and even right yeah you sort of

weaving through there are some people

dancers basically twirling around some

of them are carrying swords so you're a

little bit worried about that but you

sort of duck around them patty I ain't

worried about nothin cuz she boy just

rolled in at 20 on what skill did you

roll that was going to be it was going

to be it was gonna be a stealth check

okay or unless you wanted me to roll for

acrobatics or for athletics basically I

was just gonna have you do either

athletics record a dice to cut through

the crowd

okay well my bonus to acrobatics is the

same I've rolled in that 20 and I can

great no that's great you're okay with

that

yep okay but are you trying to be

stealthy or do you care I would prefer

to not not get a ton of knocking

attention but I think that my first

thing is not getting trampled got it

yeah and you're you're easily able to

avoid getting trampled

and there's all these dancers and clowns

and people on stilts and some people on

stilts blowing horns party horns

basically and then you manage to get to

the other side no problem and it's at

that time you start to see the crowd

it's all all the nightlife of Waterdeep

has come out to see this and this is

kind of the upper part of the city so a

lot of people you see are fairly well

dressed they can take care of themselves

you also see that all of the city watch

is basically out in force to watch and

Shepherd the parade to make sure

everything goes smoothly and that's

somewhat striking to you given how close

you are to the Waffle House and the

danger you think you might find there

yeah okay that it's almost like somebody

planned this yes I was just about to say

boy how suspicious housed us well having

noted that okay so a quick question

before hand because my Forgotten Realms

versing is not quite as it's not quite

as in-depth as possible to the rest of

us is are the gentry and a legal

organization and they have they have a

legitimate business they do make they

carry out their business in sometimes

shady ways but they're there

the the Santarem as they are found here

are basically on the up-and-up yeah a

little bit cool okay well good to know

do they have a float in the parade there

is a float and you can see it's got a

mechanical dragon on the back of it

rearing its head and just letting out

little gouts of flame nothing nothing

terribly impressive although the float

itself is quite a mechanical

accomplishment normal ish okay great in

that case also see you can also see a

big flumpf balloon behind it oh I love

fluffs well Brooks loves lumps I feel

like no I would be determinedly and

different I okay so so

do I can I do a quick perception to see

if there anyone around here who looks

like maybe a lower-level officer or

somebody who doesn't look like any

Sheriff or anything maybe just yeah you

don't have to make a check you can find

a constable perfect I'll just pull I'll

just head up to a constable and say

pardon me sir it sure doesn't look like

there's a lot of police out tonight are

you not expecting anything else to

happen he just leans over and says what

do you mean nothing else here in

Waterdeep there's always something

happening and wanted even of course

which is why I'm surprised to see this

many of you constables want a drink this

wasn't this wasn't planned if that's

what you mean then this parade wasn't

planned

no oh yes the unplanned parades of water

- yes those so all of these people built

floats and didn't tell anyone

well no this is the sea maidens fair oh

they have you know what that is yes you

do it is it is a seafaring carnival that

visits coastal cities in boats unpacks

there on the docks and then parades

around the cities but he tells you that

the sea maidens fair we have schedules

of when they're supposed to do this kind

of thing apparently there was some sort

of confusion tonight I don't know what's

up oh okay anyway we're all getting paid

to be here so I'm not complaining all

getting paid very well

who's so you're saying that that the the

precinct is paying you obviously yeah

we're all getting a little bit at Libby

extra coin in our pouches tonight of

course of course of course sensible very

well and how long do you imagine that

this parade is going to go on at all

well eventually they're gonna get to the

end of the high road and then I'm not

sure where they're gonna go they might

come back this way so you're basically

booked for the whole night then

I don't know maybe marvelous it's in

that letters better than Holland better

than hauling drunk SATA back alleys

no kidding although I'm sure there'll be

plenty of that for the people who take

the shift after yours I'll nod to them

and say thanks for the information and I

hope your night is as peaceful as is

reasonably say a clown sort of comes

over to you and pulls out of his sleeve

a bouquet of flowers and hands them to

you oh my god there could have been so

many ways that sentence could have ended

I I will I will gently gently hold a

hand up and say no thank you please uh

and I'll gesture to the constable I'll

say it like please clown give him the

flowers that constable just waves the

clown off I'll uh I'll look at the

constable and say huh

fear of clowns sorry the clown will just

throw the bouquet up in the air and tell

me a tumble off with a cartwheel oh man

I'm so paranoid okay

good to know I will I know I is going to

head off into the darkness okay toward

toward the the Waffle House and toward

the street at the house across the

street from the Waffle House more

specifically all right make a perception

check as you withdraw down a darkened

Street thirteen okay

dancin evylyn you are upstairs on the

second floor in the kids guest room aka

strictest panic room dancing you hurt

you heard you can hear the freckie s--

in the level below strix and death and

the kids but out in the hall you also

heard a ruckus and then something heavy

hit the floor

at the end of your turn you're going to

get a saving throw to break this spell

at the end of my turn

yeah the new save comes at the end of

your turn so you can't move but is there

anything you want to do before you make

that saving throw I can attack right and

there's currently there's no one in the

room with you and you have no line of

sight to anyone and I was I was in

concentration with my Sunbeam spell yes

you still have that up sick ok and where

I am I heard this commotion downstairs

you said yes I currently above the

commotion you are directly above the let

me just double check to make sure I've

got this right

dude 1 2 3 4 5 you are directly above

the pantry behind the bar sick so if I

okay another question I have movement

and an attack even though I'm under this

spell theoretically even though I can't

stop dancing right let's see you begin a

comic dance in place well what I mean is

a dancer creature must use all its

movement to dance without leaving its

space ah and has disadvantage on

Dussehra D saving throws an attack rolls

so something like a misty step wouldn't

work well if you misty stepped then that

would work you would just be dancing in

the new space and with that count as my

action or my movement that is a misty

step is a bonus action is it not yeah

that's a bonus action I mean it doesn't

eat into your movement correct unless it

unless yeah because because misty step

is a bonus action you can use that

you're not technically even though

you're changing your position on the

battlefield you are not technically

moving as far as the angles are

concerned this new step has to be to

somewhere I can see though that is

correct

also it doesn't say this in the book but

the music you're dancing to is

Technotronic right it has to be a place

that you decide I mean it could be a

techno remix of Riverdance I don't know

currently the only place currently the

only place you can see is either outside

through one of the windows or the hall

which hasn't you've got an open door

between you and the hall outside on this

floor but you can't see the level below

you okay I even is going to hear this

commotion turn her acts downward and go

okay roll your damage against this five

foot square of wooden flooring I'm

double-checking my damage you know I'm

just waiting for like the chicken run

ending we're just the front of the house

just goes okay and I'm using it two

handed okay so that's a d-10 oh this is

a case where you're not you're not

actually striking the floor with your

weapon you're just Sun beaming through

oh that's right Suns just the sunbeam

sunbeams no sorry I was yeah and so

looking it up something that will be six

d8 oh yeah okay and the floor is blinded

no this is radiant damaged floor is not

immune to radiant damage twenty-eight

all right yeah so you blast through the

floor your radiant energy just burns

away the wood and you create a black and

hole that drop

see you down into the pantry but because

you've got little Wayne boots you don't

actually take falling damage you just

kind of gently land and then resume your

dancing I want to imagine that I

actually don't even like fall I just

Riverdance

like slowly down the hole okay and I'm

like what's going on down here

and I assumed I would see paltin and

Simon especially in duress know right

you're now one level below them what but

you didn't know that no I didn't think

you got down towards me aware yes and

back my forearm so that's the tentacles

they're palton and Simon are now the

only ones on the second floor sorry

that's all right

things you know and things you don't

well I was saying sorry to palton yeah I

was trying to come for you okay so do

you want to make a saving throw to end

the dancing I also want to make mmm

bonus action if I can see anyone who

looks like they need me okay so as soon

as you land in the pantry you can look

out through the opening into the main

room and you can see Strix on the stairs

the spiral staircase staircase leading

up you see a whole nest of tentacles

basically blocking the entire doorway

and much of the room beyond you don't

think you can get out of this pantry

without going through the tentacles they

even cover or almost completely cover

the hatch leading down to the basement

you can't see him because he's ducked

behind the bar but you can hear DF

calling out from the middle of the

tentacle patch where's the earth

elemental the earth elemental is also in

the tentacle patch okay with DF the

that's here too the masked woman that

you know evylyn as the black Viper is

not in the tentacle patch but right at

the edge of it okay yeah I'm in a misty

step next to her

whoo hi so great yeah you can get a

avoid the tentacles and you appear right

next to her and from that point of view

you're far enough now into the room that

you can see DF ducked behind the bar

I'll be right there just as soon as I

stopped dancing hold on go ahead and

make a gosh I don't remember what the

same is it is a dexterity saving throw

me to you break the spell aren't you but

since evylyn is floating it's like a

little like like a cheerleader star move

in the air all right yeah so dancing

evylyn is now just evil yeah okay

excellent and that's the end of evil ins

turned black Viper you are not currently

in the tentacles neither is the small

little devil boy squidly who is near you

and and now you've got of course evylyn

standing next to you fluttering next to

you no one is actually like attacked

these sandals or anything correct

although your best guess is that these

are these tentacles are a magical spell

a magical effect so whether you can even

harm them or not remains to be seen I

mean it sure it could be yep I the one

weakness of black Viper is dares I'm

going to try to attack these tentacles I

mean I figured you said that arms right

on the edge of it yes right

yeah they fill a 20-foot square kind of

in the middle of the room okay so you

could in theory circumvent them by

walking around the perimeter of the room

but they are right between you and you

do see that two of the kids

actually in the tentacles the the wizard

the little wizard and the little fighter

girl so you're going to try to attack

the the tentacles you are five feet away

from the stairs and the bottom half of

the stairs are sort of got the tentacles

coiling around them just above those

tentacles

you see Strix the only way you could do

it without actually coming into contact

with the tentacles and potentially being

grabbed by them is to kind of spring off

of a table nearby parkour parkour off a

table on to the staircase that will be

for you a fairly easy dexterity

acrobatics check kaboom

yeah you you do exactly that you spring

off a wall onto the table off the table

onto the railing of the staircase and

effortlessly pull yourself onto it so

that you're sharing basically a step

with Strix

really quick right before that happened

evylyn and it was like nothing surprises

me in this house this is like winged

creature just like appearing before me

to stop dancing and it's not good smiles

huh sure so I leap over I jump parkour

jump up lands by Strix and I want you to

take out my hand crossbow and fire a

shot into the tentacles to see if it

doesn't okay make an attack work strike

scissors like wow that was real that was

impressive was really yeah that was

really neat I can't do anything like

that

was that was really aggressive all right

you hit a rubbery tentacle and your bolt

just kind of bounces off of it

harmlessly I snicker it is no I know I

know what I'm doing so it's uh it's

gonna be fine dispel magic all right

this is a fourth level spell so you need

to make a DC 14 okay it's on my staff oh

I'm sorry on my staff that's three

charges for my staff great but um dispel

magic yeah yeah so if it's a spell

fourth level or higher make an ability

check using your spell casting ability

cool charisma so yeah okay so I'm having

just I'm just adding my modifier yeah

your proficiency modifier all right I'm

sorry you're you're it's a it's an

ability check so it's a charisma ability

check and that's it so just add your

Christmas bonus okay okay cool so it's

14 that is exactly what you need yay all

right the tentacles magically disappear

which is good because they're really bad

okay well I do a really bad wing at the

black Viper and I'm like it's not an

attractive wink on or is it aggressive

it's just really awkward like for the

first time yeah yeah she's never done

this and there might be something in her

eye you just don't know okay um

next up is the elemental what would you

like it to do now just to recap there is

a you know that there is somebody down

in the basement because they must have

cast the spell Oh cast the tentacle

spell exactly yeah do I know also where

the giant crossbow bolts for coming from

those you're not sure but they you could

tell the direction they were coming home

they were coming from the front of the

house possibly possibly outside

somewhere okay but D it was currently

hiding

he's just crouched down by the bar yeah

okay yeah that's right okay well if I

know that there's a spellcaster in the

basement I'm just kind of kind of yeah

like hold on I'll kill you in a second

and then just like look at the elmontour

and be like just go go punch things all

right so the elemental will smash

through the bar because honestly that's

the only way it can get to the hatch

Masha's it flat pastries glass

everywhere then it goes down through the

hatch but it's actually too big to fit

so it just sort of falls in and it just

creates a much larger hole tearing out

the hatch with it and then yeah and now

you can make some attack rolls for it

there I look really guilty powder Holly

make Holly make a make 2d 20 rolls one

for each of your elementals fists and

add eight to each roll okay so I'll take

average vanish so that's not 27 and okay

a seventeen you hear the elemental

punching something soft down

here like squishing yeah pretty much

squishing noises after after you know

the the smashed wood noises right and so

yeah there's a lot of chaos down in the

basement right now

Oh before actually I wanted to before I

end my turn to misty step over to where

death is okay that's not too far it's

like literally seven feet away

in fact over there and just what

I guess just like I'm just gonna ready

like healing in case any more arrows

okay the next turn is waffles those of

you who are downstairs which is now most

of you can see this waffles do waffles

lets out a terrible howl like like a

howl you haven't heard her give before

one that you one that conveys a sense of

Terror and emergency emergency that's a

good question and so and then let's see

that doesn't take much of an action oh

then she actually shows up at the top of

the stairs coming down the stairs but

first and imagine this gigantic al bear

trying to come down this slim spiral

staircase backward okay did she get like

stuck a bit she does she does get stuck

a bit but she's forcing her way down and

you realized that she's dragging

something with her with her mouth but

you can't see it because all you see is

al bare butt and furred alright I'm

we're really trying to kind of have hit

the gravity for this scene you know I

really heard little elevator tales

why would she be happy about this we're

just like when like dogs are like really

scared and alert it's just like I'm

whatever I'm assuming whatever it is

that waffles is dragging is just hitting

every stair and yeah and so I got to

make a check for her I mean honestly I'm

hoping is dragging your body Nate that

was yes and as she does manage to

squeeze through coming down the stairs

and you do see that she's pulling paltin

by the feet and Paulson's head is going

to come clunk clunk down every step all

right and then palton is actually stuck

on something like his arm is tangled up

at the top and so he's actually being

now stretched out on the staircase and

it's it's because he's wearing like a

strap of something he realized it's

probably the bag of holding that's

gotten caught on something yes it's your

turn oh man

I like how consistently my deaths are

always hilarious everybody else's the

laugh in the face of falling that way

there is no immediate threat well

currently the elemental seems to be

holding whatever is down there at bay

yeah you haven't seen any more droughts

pop up there's still the archer outside

who when his turn comes around is

probably going to start shooting arrows

through the building again yeah that's

true

and palton does not look well no so by

this point both evil and aims tricks are

nearby right yes and all three of you

can see this tragedy unfold yeah okay

well

I guess what's kind of look over to

either one of tip both of them in kinda

like point up towards paltin and just be

like help him and then I will try but I

but I'd be able to kind of like vault up

the side of the staircase and anything

to get past waffles to make my way up

stairs just walk past Folsom's dead body

like give me well you can essentially

you can essentially pull a black Viper

and vault up onto the railing and then

basically walk around the outside of the

staircase to the top and then squeeze in

through the top I want to do that

because whatever took out palton

upstairs is still upstairs

yeah go ahead and make a dexterity

acrobatics trick alright which for you

shouldn't be too hard I hope you're

watching cuz it's gonna be really

impressive you just start to leave and

stretch like I was gonna heal you

alright bye I'm not dead on the ground

28 okay yes you you own that staircase

when you get up to the top of the

staircase you see there is a common room

there is a blood trail from the top of

the staircase to the door to the hallway

obviously this is Paul tunes blood

streaked across the floor you can see

that the his his bag of holding is

indeed caught on something you can also

see through the open hallway door Simon

lying face down on the floor

ah damnit I don't know tendon conundrum

or not but it is cuz right now

da tha's caught to the caught bag

upholding with the super important

stronger galore in it and also the dying

child historically not his historically

not his priority yeah

priority has always been his friends so

that's true uncle

dia don't pull that on me to be fair to

be fair his whatever you do is dad's not

gonna know I am gonna try to make our

way towards Simon okay when you look at

him and get to him you can see that he

has been there is a flattened imp on the

floor so there's evidence that there's

something of what happened here you can

also see that Simon is all sort of

bloated and puffy from where he got

stung and poisoned by these imp

creatures you can make a medicine check

to see if you can maybe stabilize him

okay I guess it looks like his only

chance you get look about that medicine

check oh actually pretty good 19 okay

you're not sure but you think you know

you

through all you're not sure how you do

it I guess you could leach out the

poison that's that's coursing through

his system but essentially you think

that you've gotten to him just in time

and that you may have stabilized him

okay yeah cool well then I guess that's

pretty much my turn yeah the poisonous

tails yep and you've stopped his wounds

from bleeding out all right

I imagine you just like took a pie and

like somehow whatever wasn't it like

such a poison just like on the ground

all right well I do have a I actually do

have antitoxin on me I don't know if

that would actually that would be good

well yeah let's say you use that yeah

I'll just say I used ad not properly but

yeah yeah but that saved his life yeah

all right

my-y giggle why I think you hear death a

a broom and a broom comes sort of

follows you into the hallway and then

starts sweeping up the dead imp that's

good it's one of the unseen servants

wait we thought I thought they were gone

then yep let's get that one for now

then it's the kids turn all right do the

kids want to do anything let me know

hey yeah they want to know oh dear you

also see clinging to a the railing on

the staircase that winds up to the next

level DF you see Martin and it was just

like like he's in a cage just hiding

behind the railing

all right well staring down at you only

one of them was dying so I made my

choice and he tells you that those

little creatures who attacked Simon

rooted through Paul Tain's bag and took

something out of it no you don't know

what it was

we don't know martim tells you it was it

was just kind of weird because whatever

they took out seemed to have eyes on it

that bling yeah we do there was a lot of

stuff cool any kids no I was given two

paltin at the end of well it wasn't his

crotch but yes but when it went when he

fell over on his side the amps pulled it

out of his crotch and loaded a ruble

through all of it yeah rummaged Daris

rummaged indeed so kids any of the kids

want to do anything on their turn yes

where are the kids again March um is

upstairs all the other kids are down

here in the tap room

NAT you were minutes away or seconds

away from being crushed to death by

tentacles but they're gone

Martin was is probably gonna be staying

scared yeah and hiding it tells deaath

exactly where those imps went correction

in their exact location he says once

once one of them got the stone it

disappeared like John Oh like it turned

invisible

all right the nearest thing to squiggly

living that squiggly doesn't like the

nearest thing so the nearest thing to

him currently is ant evil in which he

likes and then let's see all the black

vipers not here anymore she's up on the

staircase and he likes tricks so there's

a dead dark elf lying at his feet

and then that's about it

can squidly go upstairs to see if

there's something to to kill well he

have trouble getting up the stairs right

now because the albear on it unless he

finds a way to sort of clamor over it

which would require a check yep

he's gonna he's gonna climb in albear

alright go to my caddy 20 roll grabbing

grabbing the hair and yellows yeah and

that's a 15 that is a success you

clamour up over the albear and you see

paltin being pulled down by the boot you

stride past Politan you probably step on

his crotch or some silly thing and and

then you run up to the staircase where

you see palton is still snared on a on a

bag a satchel and there's a blood trail

leading to a hallway with simon and DF

simon doesn't look so good

squigglies just kind of stepping over

like the paul Tain's body and through it

was like sorry sorry excuse me sorry

sorry sorry okay

so Simon's not looking so good and

there's no like immediate threats not

that you can see you know when I go

check on Simon okay you can see that it

looks like he got stung by like really

big bees and so he's all kind of his

dick discolored but he is breathing

shallowly so that's a good sign

you know like grab him by the collar and

pull them of them just be like wake up

don't die on me that doesn't work well

I've tried everything

I love Jarrod's face that's just sitting

there like oh yes work together I've

done everything I can man not to Jenks

are you doing she didn't hear the owl

bear cry but I imagine it was so loud

that it like shook the floor yeah

and that sensing that really

hyper-focused her on what waffles is

doing so she was carrying paltin down

the stairs so she's gonna go try to help

waffles with paltin and at least like

keep his head from hitting more stairs

yeah yeah she pulls him down the stairs

yeah you can easily flutter up to paltin

you see that he is dying nat looks

around for an adult and there's no one

nearby and she sees that in this moment

she is the only one that can take action

well Jenks is Jenks follows her too so

it's her and Jenks like Jenks will come

with her with that okay so she signs to

Jenks like this is a field triage

situation I have to stabilize him will

you help me

Jenks is looks like it's a field trip

sorry he's still got his beach hat on

because he has his wand I can turn

things into objects but that he's like

should I make him some water can you

make real medicine when Jenks nowhere

strict's keeps her real medicine I don't

know probably yeah didn't you like

Paulie we can go get it like she

probably has like I know we have some

healing potions and stuff like probably

probably in the pantry downstairs yeah

so he'll just feel like I'll go get a

potion I know where they are okay and

that will just hold Pelton's head and

she will try to stabilize him with like

a medicine check as much as a child your

old girl can of course just make a d20

roll well Oh three okay she kind of

Pat's him downstairs and I was like

going Jenks make a make a d20 roll for

me okay it would 18 okay yeah you have

to kind of make your way behind the

remnants of the smashed bar past the

hatch to the basement which is all sort

of broken

wide and the it's really difficult

because you have to kind of skirt around

the edge there's a gap likes a big hole

in the floor and so you have to skirt

around that and you almost thought you

were gonna topple in and fall into the

basement but then you found purchase and

slipped into the pantry quite easily and

now you're rooting around on the shelves

just make another d20 roll swinging

around yeah and make another d20 roll to

see if you can find what you're looking

for that's a seven you do not all right

cool I tried Google I think it's cuz

Strix mislabeled everything mmm Strix

and arrow comes out of nowhere and

attempts to shoot you okay a big a big

black arrow literally literally flies

through the western wall pass it passing

through it almost like it's a ghost

arrow mm-hmm and then but it hits you

with a 24 you realize it's not a ghost

arrow uh-huh it's a real painful arrow

and so you take you just hear this like

wow you take 22 points of damage from

that arrow okay and then a second one

comes at you and it's gonna hit you as

well but it did shitty damage 17 points

of damage okay so so 39 total

I'm not doing great oh it's giant arrow

sticking out of me yeah

okay let's see nobody's outside yet so

they might not see that but sister narai

you probably might see something okay

make a perception check oh yeah okay I

am actually gonna show you this one

because I don't I'm sorry for all of you

who are watching NARS okay all right I

don't want this to be just like a Redux

of my first time playing with y'all and

when I was rolling really hot so I

wanted like play on it I'm sorry for

like anybody who's through up with that

vertigo situation so you're running

through you're running down a dark

street with just a few building lanterns

to light it between jacinto Street and

sell more Street we're about a block

away from Charles Skull alley when you

see flying over the building's toward

troll skull alley where you're headed

same trajectory you're on a number of

small flying snakes and you recognize

them because this is the Centaur amuse

flying winged snakes as messengers and

couriers

these ones are fluttering madly so you

can really hear their wings working hard

because they've got their coiled around

what appeared to be flasks and you know

what this is all about they're all the

members of this entire min the city that

you have to deal with the one you loathe

the most is a gnome alchemist named

scheme oh because he's a psychotic

little bastard

his name is scheme yes perhaps and so

but in addition to making potions and

other things for the santarem he also

makes alchemists fire and you can see

that these winged snakes are basically

carrying flasks of the luminous stuff in

the same direction you're going

now it's 'tried the only way this chemo

would be doing this is if history told

him to the drow down below are fighting

your elemental you can hear it okay wait

no I'm talking about Strix now okay

great

alright and I'm just going to take

average damage on my hits they don't

have magical weapons so sucks to be them

[Music]

so you can hear dark elves chipping away

here your big colossal a little down

there and then but there's it doesn't

look like that they've destroyed it it's

still rumbling and stomping around and

destroying everything that was anything

in your basement so they're done oh the

drill spouse come to that spell caster

is oh nice okay a cloud noxious green

gas billows up out of the basement to

fill part of the chamber above and I

need I think this is a pretty big cloud

that 20-foot radius yeah that's huge so

this cloud is going to and it's going to

hit Matt Jenks evylyn black Viper Strix

and that's it I think that's it okay I

have some sort of immunity or also in

evil and aura yeah so evylyn is she is

within 10 feet of all of them so that's

good we save versus anything oh yeah I

need each of you to make a constitution

saving through including one for naught

and one for Jenks um everyone gets +5

everybody gets oh no Jake Jake's Jenks

us out of the aura sad for tanks go see

what I mean country disease but I guess

I'm not immune to poison no this is this

will still affect you so let me know

what's your old starting with on

Constitution

oh yeah Paul turns in the gas cloud -

thanks for reminding me with this

constitute spell damage or just a

condition what do you know this is

actual damage even because I have

resistance to damage from spells in that

aura - but okay great in my indie aura

you are in the aura and you but I don't

think since this is a con save even

though you're unconscious you might

still have a chance of succeeding well

it's yeah if you're unconscious you

automatically fail strength and

dexterity saving throws but you can make

a constitution save yourself are you

okay all right let's start with Evelyn

what did you roll Evelyn I rolled a 16 a

16 is good enough so you take half

damage and combine with the resistance

or do I take half again yeah so you'll

take evylyn we'll take a quarter damage

and everybody has in ten feet has

resistance to damage oh great because I

have the aura of warding and the aura of

protection now what's their bonus on

their save +5

okay Strix with your plus 5 on your save

what did you roll Strix got a 15 ok

that's enough so you're also gonna take

1/4 damage and then Jenks got a 17 ok

that is enough he'll take half damage

now oh I also use this ok

I use my divine die stadt that was a +5

yeah ok then she's gonna take half

damage how did you do

palton not 20 excellent

so you're gonna take

or damage which further well it means

that he gets a automatic failed saving

through cool

so he's one success in one failure and

black Viper is that what the +5 well

that's assuming evylyn wants to give you

the +5 I should ask yeah okay great okay

so you're gonna take half damage oh

alright so the damage from the poison

crit didn't matter

it didn't matter didn't matter you

should use that 23 deaths safe okay so

so nobody's gonna take the full damage

that's nice yay evylyn made the power of

Lysander bless you even and Evelyn you

take four points of poison damage Oh a

paper cut as does Strix out net Jenks

and black Viper take eight poison damage

that puts gnat and Jenks down no the

cloud continues to billow forth and

continues to fill the area and people

who start their turns here will take the

damage again all tonie's down body just

kind of like all right and now it's

paltin stern paltin you have a death

save oh - why yes g20 roll nothing added

to it what's this what is it straight -

straight to 20 what was 10 10 is good 10

is a success so now you have two

successes and one failure cool

well alright I did I guess just come

back to me I'll be back in an hour

alright do you think a procession check

okay I hope is to see a little piece of

 get some of my best perception ever

29 okay in the common room next door to

the hall you're in you hear the window

smash okay it's not my turn right now

it's not heard that yeah sister narai

yes okay hi so I'm in the street yes yes

you are you're running debt you're

running down the street I so how close

are the snakes they are 40 feet up I

need to look up something right now yeah

and they are not over the the thing

flying over there flying over the

rooftops basic there oo there but

they're not over the Waffle House are

they no no no no no yes yes all right so

I need to make to range spell attacks

against this the most central snake to

the group I think I'm there i sees that

 does a cursory glance around her

which is hardly even a perception check

and is going to just like shoot a couple

I'll just blasts so here my 220 is here

oh okay okay so this is a plus six so

one of them one of them is a thirteen

and one of them is a 19 all right the 19

is definitely gonna hit brave this 13

you said yes

just misses okay that's fine as long as

the second one hits yep this second one

I'll just feel like I know I correct my

aim very slightly right right I have to

lead them and try and and make the

snakes ignite because I assume that

they're flying as you said in pretty

tight for me

to fly in a formation okay great all

right so you hid the creature but you

were basically aiming for the flask and

that it was if I can if I can set it off

great or even make it do like a like a

like a like a Darth Vader's escort and

crash into the other ones yeah even

better I'm hoping to recreate the start

of the last Jedi right now we're all

damaged yes oh yay okay so this is one

d-10 force damage oh okay I rolled the

zero No

okay I promise I'm not making this up

promise so this is one to ten for

Stannis is ten force damage to hit the

snack all right when you hit it it

explodes igniting its alchemists fire as

well as causing the alchemists fire of

all the surrounding ones to explode yay

and go raining down onto the rooftops

yes

so all this all this streaming fire

rains down and lights three rooftops

ablaze yes and you know you know the

cops are closed so I can only imagine

that the fire crews have some kind of

like a float or something like that they

can handle it better rooftops that a

bunch of them all hitting the same thing

and then you keep running so you'll

probably be given how fast you move

you'll probably be at the Waffle House

at the end of your next turn need a shot

or something like that cool great headed

to the house across in the Waffle House

while still watching the skies okay

evylyn Oh God you are in you start your

turn in the gas cloud I need you to make

another saving thrill Ana it's a con it

is a con yeah and you know you're plus

529 okay

so you're gonna take another four points

of damage at the start of your turn she

goes delicately she sees paulten lying

on the ground and the children crumpled

next to him I presume

yes and she needs to heal them all at

once so she is going to and you know if

you heal them but they're still in the

cloud when their turn comes around

they're going to take the damage again

and probably go down the kids I mean can

she it would probably be more than one

action for her to like scoop them all up

and drag them out of the cloud right you

could pick up one of them only one

that's an action she has no idea where

the cloud is coming from right it's

clearly coming from the basement but she

couldn't like target thee she can't see

the castor she is going to she looks

frantic and she's looking at these three

people that she loves and she's looking

around for the castor and she goes good

and she just slams the floor with light

fall okay and that automatically does

radiant damage correct mm-hmm and so

because of that she can heal everyone

one d10 okay

yeah yep so a pulse comes out from the

weapon and you finally get one smash

does some good she probably yells

Lysander while she does it to as the

abilities written it says when the

wielder hits a creature with the weapon

and deals radiant damage but you know

what I'm gonna modify that and

oh say because I like this evil and

smash idea cool cuz I didn't write that

down yeah no worries I can change how

things work

nope that's great so give roll your dice

roll your die wants to determine how

many hit points everybody gets come on

bless it please everyone bless all right

so up to six creatures gained nine hit

points back so that would be paltin

mm-hmm

the two kids mm-hmm Strix you black

Viper albear well they can't do all

their I'll do me

okay I can't do that all right you said

you Strix the two kids palton and you

can either do albear or black Viper

oh those waffles look like she needs

help

waffles does look like she's taking some

damage and it'll be waffle sorry all

right

and that's your action there's a divot

in the floor that's nice

antiquing she's like we'll always know

that was the moment Lander blessed us

all now do you have you have movement

left you want to stay in the cloud yeah

I think she will move yeah I think she's

gonna stay in the cloud because she

wants to make sure her aura holds that

makes sense those people so she'll just

stay planted black Viper what do you do

well I mean the only one not healing I'm

fine oh that's right you're still in the

cloud so make another saving throat

Constitution save apologies for the dice

oh wait is that Joyce look at the +5

you do

that's great because you're an evil in

Zorah you only take a quarter damage

from this which is going to be for you

three points of damage okay you know

yeah if you just go up to the top of the

staircase of the level above you'll be

out of the cloud I'm gonna go ahead and

do that okay when you get up there you

can see that there's a smashed window

behind you at the top of the staircase

and you hear the fluttering of little

wings as they quickly flee through the

break in the window you can also see a

what looks at a glass like a dead boy

lying on the floor through an open door

and that blood trail leading to him

no sign of death do I have any like

health questions or anything on me that

is a good question the answer to which

is no when you do that's when you see DF

he sir he was just out of sight in the

hallway but he's he's got that look on

his face and yeah you go over to him you

should see the boy the boy is actually

still alive he's just very shallowly

breathing and is unconscious okay and

I'm going to pat down the boy and see if

he has a health potion on him oh okay so

she starts going over this pad sign

lifts one of his arms up to check under

yeah it drops it down you don't find any

healing potions on the poor unconscious

stunt gosh multiple a stomach boy oh um

that is a darn good question monkeys

yeah you can see that he's got a set of

pipes like playing pipes Oh

I hold them I look them over

[Laughter]

that's not awesome but you you also

haven't seen any signs of the stone of

goal or lying about anywhere so you're

not sure where that is

yep so search searching the boy was in

action you still got some movement left

or a bonus action if you want you are

the cloud is on the level below you see

enough to worry about it

okay um I'm just gonna kind of man

giving this house I'm just gonna kind of

ready up to see if anything else flies

through a window or of course

the window I don't want that to be

directly on my back like got it yeah

you've moved out of the way of the

window okay great okay then strix you're

in the gas cloud yeah it's my turn

Constitution save you throw +5 that's 17

that's good enough so you're gonna take

a quarter damage which for use will be

three points okay I'm also one two three

I'm gonna dispel this okay make a

charisma add your charisma modifier oh

man that's good night that's 24 the

cloud goes away yeah it's gone would you

like to move yell loudly and I noticed

that Paulson and everyone else has been

healed everyone else seems okay from

what I can tell yeah right everyone

currently in the room with you has been

healed and there's no immediate danger

of the cloud okay um but I don't know if

that wizard is dead down there yet so I

would like to cast my quickened spell of

my spirit Guardians

so that the chickens can be around the

house protecting well they go out 15

feet from you right yes so they're gonna

be in the room well they go down the

stairs like they just they just form a

like a ring or a protective ring around

you okay okay um nevermind I want

something that's gonna go down the

stairs I mean I already have that that

elemental true and it sounds like the

elementals wreaking havoc down there or

at least keeping those enemies it Beth

okay okay but the the castor keeps being

an but like whatever I just tell

the elemental like to kill kill the

caster um oh I know what I need I have

these stupid arrows in me it would just

do so okay so actually I'm gonna quick

and spell and heal myself good call

so I'm gonna heal myself okay and I'm

gonna do it at me see I'm just gonna do

it it third level yeah so that's 23

points to me nice excellent

when waffles realizes that palton is

conscious she stops grabbing onto his

boot and pulling him down the stairs and

instead just kind of continues to back

her way down this awkward spiral

staircase as best she can until she gets

to the bottom and then she runs over to

you strix and just kind of playfully

tackles you like she's absolutely

thrilled to see you oh that's nice I'm

just like she licks you with her

sandpapery tongue yeah dangerous she

looks like she was like she's been very

badly spooked it's okay it's okay we

just have to get the rest of the bad

guys out of the house there's a couple

more bad guys we got to get death

whilst black Viper is distracted at

looting Simon yeah I think a child's

nearly dead make haste to wear her that

window break yes so sort of past the

back the way the black Viper came to the

common room you can see that there is a

hole in the window kind of a triangular

hole at the bottom of the window big

enough for a tiny creature to slip

through big enough for both the creature

and say stone yeah okay

and from here out the window am I able

to see back alley flying imps or a

floating stone carrying around no they

flying or do they just have little bony

legs imps have wings okay and they can

turn invisible at will

yeah you see nothing but you hear

something in the distance like might be

like horns playing in music like maybe

three blocks away

right yeah and you hear it sounds like

the town is kind of alive and some sort

of party going on this is so terrible I

hate a different kind of party okay

okay so I know the upper portions the

building are still pretty blowed up yeah

the third and fourth floor third floor

care contains much of the debris of the

fourth floor do I still have a okay path

at getting up to whatever the current

ceiling is yes if you go back the way

you've just came past the black Viper up

the stairs past martim you can continue

up the stairs all the way to the fourth

floor which is open to the sky would it

be faster just to use my second storey

of work and just climb up this like

rubble from the window yeah yeah you

think you can even get up there faster

than that I might just go out the window

and just climb straight up yep okay

that's what you do you scamper up the

the back side of the building to the

burnt charred fourth floor where you get

a view above and from up here you can

see that there is in fact some sort of

well let parade marching down high road

about a few a few blocks to the west and

of course you can hear the ruckus much

more clearly up here that's so confusing

so don't know why that's coming and then

from here I'm looking for any sign of

the Imps almost fruitlessly probably

listen for leathery flapping yeah okay

or even by potentially notable figures

kind of standing I guess

nearby waiting for instinctive delivery

like a perception check okay okay you

can see to the south of here what looked

like some small fires burning on the

rooftops of some buildings about a block

away that's but you don't see hide nor

hair of the Imps or their masters all

right well those fires are my problem no

I guess I'm also looking for and are

okay that you know you could have to

sort of go through the wreckage toward

the front of the building which is kind

of the opposite side you climbed up on

yeah where I got Joffrey yeah as you

climb over the wreckage I assume you're

trying to not announce your presence up

there and just can't really low yeah as

you peer down using your 21 you can see

a figure standing outside of follows

residence with a big-ass bow and he's

just taken another one and he's just on

the literally on the ground preparing to

shoot through the wall of the building

and you see it's a big half work a

monster how far away is he from me he

would be let's see where I'm up to right

down to where he is so if you were to

drop down the building that's about a

30-foot drop and then he is about 50

feet that way I guess so about about if

you were to go diagonally about let's

say say 60 feet make it an even 60 well

I guess the biggest thing is if he's

knocking up an arrow I don't want him

shooting into that building for our

building so if it's if I can reach them

from here with her throwing moon

Allinger want to do that okay oh the

other thing I forgot to mention about

him is his eyes appear to be glowing

that's part of the reason why you can

see him ah I'm going to assume that's

also how he's been seeing us in the

building and not possess'd know he's got

he's got a hell Mon with sort of a

little black plume or tail on it and

then through through the slits in his

eyes you can just see they're glowing as

he's bringing his huge lungs longbow to

bear well what's your range sorry it's a

dagger right so 60 feet is at the that's

the that's as far as you can throw it

okay so because you would be at long

range your be a disadvantage on the

throat I'm still gonna do that okay

because

okay where I've got covered after DF

throws a day to realize this doesn't

matter because right you have no cover

yeah at disadvantage 16 that misses

that's fine and then you'll recall when

splinter back to his hands alright that

does get its attention

I hope I spook them you did okay that's

DF kids do any of the kids want to do

anything and no can be a perfectly fine

answer Oh what I mean we all just like

woke up in the cloud right yeah well the

clouds gone strings to settle it so when

NAT and Jenks you because of the healing

that you received from evylyn you kind

of wake up nat on the stairs Jenks in

the pantry with a whole bunch of bottles

lying on the floor around him and it

just feels like you're waking from a nap

now it's like I fell asleep thanks is

just going to continue sleeping coffee

he's like falling asleep on our bear

alright that was administering tip Alton

does Carlton look okay to her yeah she

did a great job he seems to be alive and

conscious then she's just holding his

head and like looking around for the

adults to be like see my good work see

you and I did mmm she's just still chill

just sit there squidly you're upstairs

with the black Viper do you want to do

anything um Simon is still

non-responsive is there anything that is

the proper dimensions and weight that

squidly could attempt to eat at the

black Piper so he can probably like pull

the cap off the banister

hell yeah I just throw this wooden ball

at her head yeah all right try and shuck

it go ahead and make a go ahead and make

a d20 roll you scamp 16 16 men that hit

sir all right so you got clocked by this

stupid wouldn't banister post thingy and

let's say oh gosh just roll a d4

scriptable okay yeah three you take

three points of damage from this heavy

wooden ball and for the rest of your

turn you are annoyed just like I'll show

you and Martha Martin was there as well

so he witnessed squiggly provoking this

woman and probably really impressed but

Martin is Martin was still just scared

of everything got it

you see that that was sick right all

right I was glad you're around now real

sad Jarrod the half-orc kind of takes

his aim up at you and then just lowers

it back down and fires through the house

and then takes another one no fires it

through the house aha

black Viper you are crit by the first

one well the last order Siraj received

for mr. ed horn was don't let any harm

befall the kids and apparently he seems

to think you're a threat to them I don't

know why maybe because squidly is

attacking you but so the first one hits

you

and this is gonna really hurt 4:33

uncanny dodge so you have no oh yes yes

you have you have one reaction and Kenny

dodge you can have the damage that you

take

so 33 becomes 16 points of damage

so squiggly if there was essentially

just get honor pretty much yes oops and

then the second attack which since

you've already used your reaction you

can't on Kenny dodge this one it does 22

points of damage

how you doing are you still on your feet

yes okay good to to air phantom arrows

come out of the staircase it looks like

and just shoot up at you nearly taking

you off your feet and squiggly when

those arrows come they literally come

from under your feet and Lance through

her I did that yes you do okay Oh Strix

make 2d 20 rolls for me for your

elemental I forgot about him okay and

just still squishing yep add H to each

one okay so it's a dirty 20 and OH

20 and 24 okay so squish squish squish

mm-hmm those of you who are in the tap

room which would be evylyn and Strix and

NAT can you hear the elemental getting

farther away like it's digging down into

the tunnel it must be pushing the

enemies back into the sewers oh that's

good good job and there are no droughts

forthcoming

palton you're alive yeah with the

healing given to you by Lysander and

evylyn right in the morning Lord and

that's like like cradling my head it's

like why is this child holding my head

why am i on the state why does my head

hurt oh my god why does my head hurt

what happened she Pat's your forehead

thank you he like just very almost

offensively like tries to sign like

thank you

[Laughter]

she likes her eyes at you and like drops

your head good oh okay she just strides

down the stairs so what do what what's

what do I wake up to what's going on so

saved your life again you see the bar

the bar has been destroyed there is loud

pounding noises coming from the basement

there's a kid asleep apparently in the

pantry and even strix has been kind of

cornered by waffles who's licking her to

death and there's this horrible smell in

the air just the faint wisps of what

used to be a toxic cloud hanging in the

air cool so someone's been feeding

lawful zegs again yeah

and Simon who you last saw who you

reached out to well I said I'm proud of

you my son you don't see him anywhere

you've been probably son I'm gonna run

upstairs and find my son okay when you

run upstairs you see an open window with

a hole in it air coming in from night

air coming in through that but through

an open doorway you see your son lying

on the floor dead at the hands of the

woman standing on top of him now you see

a woman literally standing over him with

two big arrows stuck in her those arrows

look familiar to you you have felt them

I know and Simon Simon is lying dead at

her feet or it might be not dead you're

not sure he like looks into the room and

gasps and it's just like ah no and like

runs straight toward like run straight

toward the woman then just kind of like

plumps her out of the way

and like slides in in front of in front

just my son what happened that arrows

were like for like two minutes ago

it's we're over it all right Simon and

he is breathing but is unconscious and

you could see why he's been poisoned and

badly stung multiple times oh no I don't

have any kind of I'm not I'm not I'm not

the heal I'm not the support but I can I

do what do i do I have an inkling of

anything I can do unless you have

magical healing nope he's dying he's

dying to death perfect sister narai when

you come barreling out into the troll

skel alley you can see zu Raj his bow

not currently loaded just sort of

reaching back and toward his quiver yeah

also I want to know where the snakes the

only leathery wings I heard flapping yes

all right yes we're not direction in

that case do I see deaaath me no you see

you see the building appears to be

mostly just dark burnt out on the top

the top two floors are kind of a mess

the bottom two floors not great shape

either you don't see anybody except

Suraj in the street all right and he's

not making a lot of noise any sort of

standing in a darkened place if his eyes

weren't glowing you would have a hard

time seeing him yourself all right I

will

[Music]

staying to darkness and I'll make a

stealth roll for that all right bad I

rolled poorly for stealth

I only rolled in 11 so sticking kind of

towards the darkness and towards the

shadows

Neriah is going to move toward move

towards Suraj to kind of get a get a get

an idea of what's going on with the

situation right now you can get as close

to him as you want to how close do you

want to get 20 feet well 50 let's say 15

feet before whispering Suraj he doesn't

look at you a sort of a very subtle way

of telling you that he knew you were

there he doesn't express any surprise

but he does lower his weapon and just

sort of in here where is the stone

I don't know she's gonna look both ways

around this around the around the area

she says the bard had it but I don't

know where it went

where's the fire I'd still have it on

the second floor um is he dead

not yet he takes a bow arrow out does

she just let fly or nope he's just

knocking so I'm going to say I'm going

to say stop stop stop

here's eleven there's not more combat

happening is there or I should say I

should say is that are they are they

engaged at the moment they used an earth

elemental to drive the Dark Elves away

there were some creatures I think

they're imps on the second floor

attacking them I think they may have

gotten the stone and where did they go

I don't know

I'm nariah is going to say I'm going to

investigate the BART

stand down unless you're attacked you

don't give me orders they're all all

doubled you know that you know that

istra dand another woman named Tashlin

are the only ones he's accustomed to

taking orders from very well I'll say

mr. dent Ashland don't know this

situation

I've spoken with everyone in this house

and Diplomacy nah okay

Sagan diplomacy wins the day

he says disapprovingly for now I'll

signal if we need anything there's one

watch for him one what one of them you

see that move from Strix all right

[Music]

I'll stand down you get the stone I'll

do my best and disappearing I will I

will reappear in the shadows hopefully

in the darkened room where palton lay

lies the last thing you hear is Suraj

say--is spells running out anyway okay

so so who do I see in this in this top

room can I make a perception so where

are you exactly going so you said where

didn't you say if they were on the

second floor

yes so and there's a balcony that you

can climb up to to get up there yeah

sure I'll just use that that's great

okay

yeah so you pull yourself up there you

don't have to make a check it's super

easy and the doors locked

I mean unlocked so you just do you not

have like an alarm system installed like

the gnomes have that I'll call the

police for you you like missing its top

floor you think AB see really

yeah that's fine in any case she will

see if she can make a make kind of take

stock of the situation when she's up

there all right yeah when you get up

into the second floor and into the house

you can make your way through waffles

den into the common room by the time you

get there you see the black Viper with

arrows sticking in her you see paltin

huddled down over this young boy who

looks like he might be dead or almost

dead and that's what you see first you

also see you see a staircase going down

into the top room seeing the dead boy

there I will without even thinking about

it

not particularly loud more to herself

but probably audible say no something

like that you hear palton just start

like talking just coincidentally like

children are dying in here for this

constant kids lives what kind of

heartless garbage trash person would do

this are you talking about me

no not you didn't kill any kids today

okay so and nor anyone remotely

associated with what's going on okay so

I look at oh look at the perceiving it

as dead boy when you go over and you

look over pulsing shoulder at the boy

you can see right away the boy is still

alive oh breathing he's dead he's

breathing but he looks really really

like he's been poisoned he's been stung

just he's in bad shape

really bad shape for an 11 year old or

whatever yeah yeah that's questionable

very well

the last thing that I think is my six

seconds are probably up at this point

the last thing that she will say

is is what happened to your poor boy

this is this wasn't the plan that's

being said to me yeah sure yeah you

think it's just a poor boy that's what I

said

what happened to it buddy like I'm sorry

you set up such a good stick closely

right yes so these arrows wait it wasn't

the nose nose the UPS no it was the IMP

thank you we are out of initiative was

the Imps yeah we're out of initiative in

yeah what imps well this conversations

going on a black Viper you've still got

two big arrows kind of lodged in your

body careful not to acknowledge the

arrows is just these imps and bay they

reached for my crotch and then there was

poison in me and then I was I me and my

son were dead and then I wasn't then my

son might still be dead today I think

there's no one no one can help him

someone help him the poor boy who's

dying because you said he was not a

medical school I don't get a good

anybody anybody can do whatever they

want now he comes in stop being so

dramatic this isn't for you

alright so evil and you you tend to the

boy how much healing you need to give

Simon I feel like as his mother she

would know how many hit points he has he

has five she gives him five okay like

also for what it's worth I'm down

roughly what you could call a tea

she's like Oh cradles his cheek 480

[Laughter]

libraries and is it is dawn to you it is

dawned on you that it seeming of

increasing unlikely that they don't have

the stone anymore which is unfortunate

oh I can't give you 80 actually Nate I

can only give you I guess if she notices

VIPRE as she's doing Leon hands

I'm very noticeable right now so okay

she gives five to Simon she's in the

midst of giving what she thinks is gonna

be fifty two paulten but his black

Piper's kind of like tap-tap-tap she's

like oh yes of course she just gives

forty two palton and tend to black Viper

hold on just one second

[Laughter]

so I if I guess by Caesar Raj kind of

start to stand down yeah he does

you also see his eyes go dark okay

another quick survey of the area for any

sign of the Imps or of the stone or it's

like that and failing

I'll start make my way back down into

the house got it so you come down the

stairs and you see everybody else

president okay waffles I feel like is

just now sat on strikes fair so strikes

is on the ground you just hear like

please help please please call the owl

wear waffles come here honey come here

baby girl

and I imagine she just like pounds off

of this is like like like a big dog also

jumps off you and they kind of kick you

on the way up I stole the arrows in me

so

just gonna stand up and just like pull

those out okay and that was gross and

then I'll put those in my panic room to

keep for later that uh yeah I will just

go rejoin the others and kind of just be

like hey so where's the stone indeed

where is the stone

yeah Paulson wasn't it in your pants

well there is a bit of a gap blink' we

don't need to know about in your pants

we just need to know where to start

it's gone it's gone

what so the stone it's they took it

you're still out you still have the bag

of holding that it was the bag that it

was stuffed in but it's it was removed

yes

you didn't this bag and then I died you

wouldn't do that how this works yes

you're alive now so who cares cool very

cool dead not saved you and then I I

helped okay well it was in here can I

just like slip over the bag and yeah

really

empty out everything just give ya or

somewhere there like Jarl Axl's like

leather outfits fall out there's all

kinds of wonderful costumes in there

wigs and sequined eye patches it's not

anything that we know whose this was

very clear yes we'll say that uh how

Martin

basically saw all of it and then last I

heard was a small window shatter

emphasized Hall well could you straight

you locate that object I can hear um I

can try and locate the magical object

but here's the deal we know who has it

those imps work for the castle an turds

so they took it

we know they took it

and all we have to do is go take it back

from them sounds like a plan wait oh

okay

this this whole thing I like point to

like the NAM parries like this whole

thing like can-can the Viper and I share

like a look to each other what the

what you cannot how you're talking in

front of us oh yeah yo can you leave can

you leave us you know it actually just

give us one minute and I'm gonna cast us

safe level banishment on both of them

outstanding so let's make ourselves some

sanic throws black Viper like we never

like really ask fight for what's going

on right right she has a story to tell

but you're never going to hear it so

charisma saving throws please go to the

same plane now so you they they they are

dismissed from your presence leaving the

waffle crew alone alright good you'd

only have a minute we need to figure out

what's going on yeah mm-hmm I don't

think this is how we keep people coming

back to the bakery but we can have this

discussion later um also I broke another

floor sigh its I still hear like the

earth elemental like smashing like the

castle Anders took it if there imps the

best part about it is like they're in

they're in some cahoots with Asmodeus so

all we do is you just send me they can't

hurt me I just go over there and I say

you give it back to me your dad told you

to give it to me I'm assuming that

Asmodeus is their dad if possible it's

better if we are able to get that stone

before they even retrieve it right mate

the best option we could do is that we

get the information of where this hoard

is so no one else even knows where to

look for it

you mean if we just go to that but but

you didn't attune to the stone so it

couldn't tell you I haven't had time so

we have to find these amps I guess I can

do I can I can detect magic but I don't

think that it's gonna be far enough but

I can try I don't know how far that'll

go more importantly we need to figure

out why these two are even here yeah

yeah that's that's fair but it's figure

out what is actually the most important

here I'm a little I mean no Lysander's

the most important but aside from that

I'm just not sure what the most

important thing is right now it is

important though that they're just kind

of like where we sit in with us right

now is just like weird is it such a bad

thing for the castle entrance to have

that rock cuz our house is falling down

the whole point was that we have to get

the gold for the dwarves right yes why

that's the point because I need to

oh right well I mean Haltom and I have

50,000 gold if you need some what it's

not enough so we go to the castle

entrance and we go and ask lanterns

lanterns I don't care let's just go tell

them or take it from mum or I don't know

they're clearly evil and the moment we

take it from them we got another enemy

upon us so what do we do I don't leave

we leave you know what let's just leave

the plane plane shift we go where we

want weren't we supposed to be the

castle Andrews allies that's what they

wanted us to be but the last thing were

to do is do anything for a bunch of

devil worshippers oh I I mean no I mean

the the thing is the earth like I like

to stick to a plan and I like to like

help but I feel like I keep trying to

stick to our plan and I don't feel like

I know what it is anymore like I was

trying to wear my disguise and and I was

waiting for a mansion to show up and

then that never

and now all the kids almost died and now

we're talking about turning on an ally

and I just really don't feel like I know

what direction you're leading in can you

help me understand I don't I don't I I

don't know I've alright Wow aren't you

butter aren't you the leader yes but I

know I've just I all of this this has

all been for my own selfish reading it's

reasoning and I've wrapped you all up

into it and got you all hurt because of

that I don't think it's selfish I mean

you're just it's it was an accident it's

not selfish for that look and here's the

deal we trust you and we'll follow you

but you got to take a step in some

direction because I feel like I'm

spinning yeah I feel like I spending too

much now I want to throw up is that the

same yes only quitting and on dear said

look no listen honestly look look look

she's right we need a plan of action we

need an actual direction to take and you

you've been freezing man it's been a lot

of freezing and I know it's hard and I

know that it's it's very it's so

personalized what we need to do for you

well we're gonna do it

we'll help you just we need to know what

you need us to do you know you're my

best friend and I don't want to see you

I don't want to see you hurt yeah it's

just kind of response to that just kind

of ends up sitting down and putting his

like head into his hands and as doesn't

have an immediate response but you can

he didn't say no we're best friends now

here my taking deep breaths to himself

and and the gears are turning so you

know as soon as you're ready to tell us

what to do while the Imps are fine with

the stone

I don't know what is that Strix you have

your broom evylyn you can also fly yeah

between the two of you can look at the

object to be able to get that in midair

before it returns to them we need to do

it now that might be our last chance we

can't make it there then we plan for the

cast lanters all right great plan let's

go

during the head paltin you me those are

gonna be back any second now we need to

be ready to talk to them cool so don't

instantly banish them when they come

back got it all right let's go evylyn

yeah

all right so drew they make it like a

group the high 500 yeah kind of misses

team evil imminent Strix leave mm-hmm

it's a hole in the ceiling and follow us

around at this point it's all important

demo mm-hmm so as they as the as the

radiant charred flinders rain down upon

you and paltin death you wait and then

the banishment spells ends and your two

guests return banishment didn't

banishment intent good you're back why

has a cryptic smile on her face and says

yes indeed

I was worried I'm always worried

wonderful time together private time

what wonderful private time what are you

doing here both of you wait y'all do it

while you were banished no can you do

that in that dimension what was it like

was it like a like a hotel room or is it

like some kind of dimension of like like

I don't know I just said it was nice

should I told you to grab me something

Oh anyway we're fine as a matter of fact

she says nodding to black Viper do you

think we should take our leave

it really seems like all of you have

this under control I say as I look at

the house completely and noticing all of

the kids still staring at me I feel like

maybe I'm not as welcomed here as I once

I never was I don't trust this just just

pause for a second I'm gonna do another

banishment cause make a really all right

yeah I don't like this they need more

time to react this is such a problem

honestly I'm like thinking about

deliberately failing this one oh my god

this is a Christmas yeah 18 that's good

enough yeah I also rolled in 18 actually

your bellies oh this saves 20 that's

right I forgot cuz your hand right

mm-hmm oh yeah so disappear you go

like all right they were way too

confident when coming back they're up to

something what do we do right

[Laughter]

something's off at no point did we ever

know anything about sisters alright and

lady s filet sorry black Viper ever

working together when it just come up

out I don't know I was again dead so I

meant far earlier than this but yeah oh

I don't know I have no idea he'll be

back in 44 seconds okay cool alright so

how do we how do we question then happen

them how do we interrogate this is what

we know we know that sister dinner

arrived works with as interim at least a

faction of this entirely s filet was on

her own trying to obtain the stone which

means if the black Vipers here talking

to lady to mr. Narayan point the two of

them were trying to get this on four of

BTS filet 30 seconds which if that's the

case

sister Neriah claiming that was for the

dwarves unless

unless Escalade is also doing it for the

doors I highly doubt that being the case

I could just suggest that they you know

tell us what they're really up to or we

kill them I don't wanna kill anyone I

didn't say we're gonna I'm just sayin

I'll just tell them 15 seconds so let's

just let's just let's just talk to him

let's just persuade him all right we

didn't know we know why they're here is

for the stone more importantly we need

to know why they're working together and

ultimately who forth they really are

hey y'all - give me a latte I'm so sorry

about that

[Music]

no I latte in hand

[Laughter]

yes well well we'll offer it to uh to to

Paulsen and then retract it before he

can snatch it

taking a deep something and saying just

kidding this one's mine oh okay okay

doesn't matter we have some questions

for you guys

if you don't mind what are you what

what's y'all up to well why you why you

working together

why do you wave burns literally never

spoke to her until you banished us I've

literally never seen her before in my

life until I saw her standing over that

dead body near a dead body

okay then how about this between the two

of you what are you doing for lady s

filet

I think lady s Villa is absolutely

magnanimous wonderful and an absolute

wonderful darling I would do anything

for I have no idea who that is

good talk do we have anything else

I mean over know that wasn't asking you

look I know why both of you are here

perhaps for your own agendas then but

it's not here

we can't help you you're apparently

wrong spot mm-hmm

so Mariah's going to briefly surveyed

the room and and say well seeing as

there's not much left to say I'm glad

that you're that the children that

you're keeping in this war zone are

still safe and well I think that I'll

take my leave I leaned over and kind of

brushed myself and all of my blood off

of it and I take a couple steps lean

over and pick up that that uh pipe that

I had tossed over my shoulder before

yeah and turn around and toss it to Anna

and the kids and be like yeah you drop

this and start grumbling no no I don't

walk down the stairs like parkour down

those stairs message to them we'll just

be like try as you might that money does

not belong to you I turn around right

before leaving and slamming the door Oh

be sure you will see me again we are not

through here and also hate call me what

Oh what what happens in extra

dimensional spaces stays and everyone

just everyone with everyone on this show

damn yes we we uh we need that fine that

they're gone that they're leaving not

that it matters cuz they left yeah

that's that's fine cool does it feel

like like the seams

probably like cut at this point or

something what are you even talking to

the scene cuts but are we flying around

looking for a stone no I'm just sort of

lingering on this squiggly walks by with

an apple like it's just and it just

never ends

but that is where we'll stop cut all
