hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action whoo a DNA game with me Chris

Perkins as your Dungeon Master and today

we are short one regular cast member as

an oppressor Robinson is gearing up for

our big big giant huge twitchcon

extravaganza which will include a live

D&D game featuring all of us and our

guest today vivid vitka me yeah thank

you for joining us and is I apologize in

advance all right so first a quick recap

our heroes the waffle crew arrived in

Waterdeep some months ago aboard a ship

called the brazen Pegasus which it

turned out was owned by a water Davian

noblewoman named as valet Rosner before

the ship made port it lost its captain

its captain or to me was lost at sea in

an incident involving the waffle crew

and deaath promised the first mate

greg Radel that he would speak to lady

Rosner on his behalf about the incident

shortly after arriving in water deep d/f

also found himself at odds with the

dwarf clans of the north who held him to

accounts for an incident that occurred

many many months earlier in the high

mountains of the silver marches when

deaath obtained an iron flask that had

been possessed by drow and released a

fire primordial a fire Titan that had

been bound inside it this Titan laid

waste to a fire giant stronghold and

killed or severely burned a number of

dwarven slaves so DF has been trotting

around the city ever since ensuring to

the well-being of his friends their

establishment of their new abode in the

North Ward and attending to other

matters one of the things that

wanted to do was basically put a cork in

this lady Raj in our business choice

words so DF on on a sunny day some weeks

ago in the early spring you show up at

the Raj Nair estate now you did some

research prior to arriving here and

learned a little a couple things about

house Rajan are one they were once

banished from water deep for smuggling

slavery and other crimes

it's at etherion house which has since

returned and is trying to as far as the

rumour mongers attest overcome its dark

past and it's disgraceful reputation by

focusing on legitimate business ventures

such as gem making wine making and sea

trading the Rajan Arvilla you've

discovered a situated on thunder staff

way between copper Street and shield

Street in the C ward west of the high

road so it's in one of the pretty much

the most expensive real estate place you

can imagine in the entire city its high

ground in the city it's mostly well

tended well policed

and and clean however very out of debts

element exactly however you are somewhat

surprised or maybe not when you come to

the estate and you realize that unlike

the very well tended well-maintained

edifices around it this one kind of has

a neglected countenance a somewhat

sagging demeanor you can see some of the

slate tiles of the roofs have broken off

and fallen away and up and replaced the

building walls which are just absolutely

overgrown with ivy you see that most of

the Ivy is dying or possibly just

struggling to survive or maybe coming

back to life but it's all sort of gray

and dead for the most part except for a

few sparse leaves here and there hang

yourself ivy and the wind the windows

are sort of old and most of them covered

up with dark drapes and as you advance

up the steps to the front doors you see

that the paint around the doors is

weathered and chipped and even the the

stone pediment above the doorway seems

somewhat ill aligned like it might like

much of the structure is kind of sagging

and listless and weary of standing there

is a pull rope next to the door probably

connected to some sort of Bell mechanism

that looks like it was recently replaced

oh good I didn't want to knock anyway

yeah I had like a sort of doorbell yeah

big pull cord for the doorbell yeah

it'll kinda like put a hand upon it and

then just take a moment strike and then

ring it okay you are greeted fairly

quickly by an old decrepit tall man

probably about 6 1 6 2 very thin bony

thin a Reedy long faced servant who

takes your name and asks your business

I'm my name is Woodrow I'm here to speak

to lady Rajan are on behalf of captain

or to me he tells you in a soft voice

that lady Rosner and her kin are out and

about and not present at the moment Oh

Tarkus I'll try back later huh ok yes

bounds down the stairs leaving the old

man momentarily vexed but he just sort

of his eyes roll back into his head and

he just closes the door and disappears

into the sepulchral darkness of the hall

beyond he'll be back he he nods

with the negative that he doesn't and

you get the you get a sense that he has

done this job far longer than he should

have and has lost all will to live and

as you sort of glimpsed over his

shoulder into the dark Hall beyond the

only thing that sort of struck you was a

musty smell that smelled hints of

perfume and mildew mixed together with

just age and decrepitude as well as what

looked like kind of a decorators

travesty a fashion nightmare a the decor

inside sort of outlandish ly outdated

and overwrought but as you hasten away

make a perception check all right so gif

doesn't like immediately run run away

but after like he whose closes the door

D Arthur's colleague sits down at the

bottom step and just kinda like puts his

head into his hands for a moment just

like huh 22 you get the uncanny feeling

that in this moment you are being

watched and watched by something

unnatural as you do crane your head to

look around you get the feeling that the

house itself is glaring down upon you

look back at the house when you do you

see on the third floor the windows which

are sort of made of leaded glass with

dark frames have iron wrought sort of

fencing around their lower half with

little spikes sticking up and that

fencing is all sort of rusted and and

old and the brickwork around the window

is crumbling but you see that the

curtains of that window are now parted

where before you were

pretty sure they were drawn and standing

in the window glaring down at you is a

woman in black with a veil over her face

she looks like a black Specter or wraith

at first glance until you see underneath

that veil is a pale visages how to early

for this then after kind of looking back

over shoulder and seeing that death will

rise to his feet and turn towards the

window just look back up towards it

trying to make eye contact or you've

ever been it's because of the veil you

can't really gauge the woman's age and

as you kind of stand and turn toward her

she just kind of recedes into the

darkness of the room pouring a little

bit more right should I want to somehow

ascend to that third storey window

Wow what structures and/or natural

things nearby would help me do so there

are trellises eaves and just sort of

stone carved protrusions aplenty up the

walls aided by the iron grillwork

that's bolted to the walls that would

facilitate an easy climb okay the window

itself doesn't look like much of a

conundrum for a thief of your expertise

I mean I don't call myself fat but yeah

it's time is it it is like midday bright

Sun glaring down at you the shadow the

shadow of the house is falling away from

you at this hour so the the

facade of the building is fairly well

lit okay well that's the problem so a

third story I can do this quick I'm just

going to climb my way up there using my

second-story work ability yeah so that I

can do it quite very expeditiously yes

pull it off without a check yeah I just

want to get to the window itself just so

I can call into it okay and just be like

lady Rajan are yes you can look through

the window and see what appears to be a

conservatory beyond and the woman in

question is standing near a hearth and a

chair parked in front of it caressing

the chair lovingly with her back to you

but you can hear you through the window

and she does sort of turn a little ways

in your direction but does not lift her

veil and does not engage you anymore

for the record I actually don't know

what lady Rajan are looks like correct

okay yeah it is it is clear that she is

wearing a mourners veil and a black gaff

black funeral gown yeah I'll call out

again lady Raj North that's you I only

wish to speak

she beckons you to enter silently cool

good before I do that I immediately look

down to see if should I need to make a

quick escape what the best way to do

that and just immediately have that

escape plan okay you log that in your

memory yep okay good

and then I go through the window okay

the window is unlocked unlatched and

when you step through into the room

you're greeted by sort of the same musty

smell that you sensed it downstairs all

of the other windows are covered up

there's like three or four along one

wall a large hearth as I mentioned that

is not lit it's not and as you stand in

the room you can see that there are some

drapes covering strange objects about

the room inhuman inform monstrous in

scale in a few cases your best guess at

glance is that they might be instruments

and does yes

and as she caresses the chair she says

this was his favorite chair

I stand I stay like directly next to the

window okay I don't enter or reproach

her at all like I'm staying right here

to speak he says she says she turns to

you and says are you a friend of my

daughter's a suitor come seeking my

permission

oh no that's this isn't I'm sorry this

dot there seems to be a mistake

you hear above you through the ceiling

a sound that is unnatural in a place

such as this and also in the tomb like

silence catches you by surprise because

it's loud and it's a rustling noise like

hundreds or maybe thousands of Wings in

the ceiling and she says she looks up

and hears the sound and she says they've

taken over what huh the bats they've

taken over

I don't I I'm sorry I was I was just

here to speak to s Patel I think there

seems to be some confusion I don't mean

it interrupts I can go she says I can't

sleep with all of that racket if my

husband was alive he would take care of

it but he's dead oh that's horrible

who was your husband the lord of this

estate Oh what happened to him he passed

away

I can't sleep I have not slept in days

because of the bats in the roof I'm I

mean based on what little I know on your

estate I'm pretty sure you can probably

pay someone to exterminate them or maybe

open a window up there she looks up at a

corner of the room and you can see that

there's a hatch in the ceiling like an

attic access point you you said you're

some eyes there's probably several of

them on this level in various rooms and

places and she says

it used to be quiet

right and now no matter what you just

always hear something I know what they

came with a strange smell can you smell

it

can I smell it make a perception check

you're smelling musty nests you're

smelling maybe a hint of perfume on the

lady by the chair yeah you're smelling

ashes in the fireplace

well my perception is pretty good so I'm

canny sniff 24 you do smell something

earthy that doesn't seem to have a place

here maybe even like bat dung on top of

that right she says they came here

uninvited I don't know how they got in I

wish to be rid of them I are you asking

first assistance from me because I'm

pretty sure is a lot of people who are

far more qualified she says can you help

me I mean well I guess takes a moment

you kind of think to himself like how

did I get here if my husband were alive

I would ask him and she looks at the

empty chair I'll take a few steps

towards the hatch okay that sound yeah

coming you hear there hear the faint

rustling of the bat noises up ahead

yeah and as as I'm walking that way

yes well asked what was your husband's

name

Valen Valen right what's your name

Valencia that's fine this is fine okay

well I mean they're just baths right so

it's so in that room is there like a

window that they can just be let out or

I don't know I've never been up there

huh so who knows what's up there like

she looks at the empty chair when us -

does you honestly just walked into that

you could see now you've talked to her

long enough to tell that she's probably

a woman in her 50s or 60s but has not

ancient or decrepit in any way and looks

like she's preserved herself fairly well

or Nature has or perhaps some some noble

embalming solution has you're not sure

yeah

exactly yes precisely oh you do it you

do at this point also notice that there

is a little bit of guano on the floor

here of the conservatory where it must

have slipped through the cracks in the

door and the ceiling Oh God all right

well I'm about to walk into some so

there's no easy way to get up there

without a ladder but you could pull

something like I covered harpsichord

over and basically leap up on that yeah

I'll find like a piece of furniture like

pull over when you step around and you

step on something you hear this sort of

playing

and as you put your foot on some chords

before I do that I like to look out and

be like oh may I please all right so

yeah I pulled over and like use that to

elevate myself up to get close to the

hatch and I'll be like all right I'm

just gonna take a key to see if it's

something that maybe I can handle my own

and if it isn't I can get some

assistance or contact the proper

professionals for you all right

when you hop up and you push the hatch

open there is some pressure on the other

side but then you realize because the

other side of hatch is just covered with

bat yeah so it's just the weight of

it yeah no weight of it all and so when

you push the hatch away and it flops

over you hear it all kind of sloth off

onto the wooden attic floor and you see

up here is a spacious vast chamber with

light coming in through windows at the

various ends occasionally crossing the

light passing over rafters that are

caked in dust and you can also see that

there are actual holes in the roof

through which sunlight is streaming

sending these rays down at various

points and revealing clouds upon clouds

of swarming bats okay so are these poles

in the ceiling large enough to let the

bats out yes the wind and the wind the

windows are closed and sort of caked in

grime but the holes are definitely big

enough for the bats to come and go hmm

okay make a perception check okay Oh

nailed it thirty Wow

okay so you see as you gaze around that

most of the Attic is been was cleared

out a long time ago there's almost

nothing up here but sort of half caked

in guano really just sort of the

suggestion of its shape is what appears

to be an old set of manacles that have

obviously rusted and corroded and are

bolted to the floor at a sort of anchor

point in the middle of the room so that

anybody who was chained to the manacles

could not reach a wall

after or ceiling and about 15 feet

beyond that in what you can are but

about 30 feet beyond that in what you

consider to be the middle of the Attic

there is something rising up out of the

batshit and you're pretty sure it is a

coffin lying flat on the floor and it

does not appear to have a lid

there's no literally no way to get to it

without like stepping through the

batshit it's like a carpet of grayish

white residue I'll descend out of the

hatch a moment

breathe some fresh air okay the woman is

gone okay okay

nothing about nothing about the room has

changed other than she's just gone okay

is there any other door or exit to this

room to the conservatory yes there is

there is a set of double doors that are

closed that lead out you assume to the

heart of the third floor probably a

hallway you imagine there's also side

doors single doors two on either end of

the conservatory and then there are four

big windows all three of which are

covered by drapes the other one is as

open as it was left when you entered all

right

I'm gonna try to go towards the

conservatory and just to see if there's

still other people existing in this

house

oh okay when you go to the door and you

sort of put your ear up you can hear

sounds in the house beyond suggesting

there are people here okay and I don't

have any sort of suggestion or evidence

that when you clear out you can look

into a sort of hideously decorated hall

with many doors leading off of it and

you can see that there is a maid

basically taking a chamber pot

downstairs she's young

okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna open

the door a little bit so I can call it

towards the chambermaid mm-hmm

not let her see me right I'll even

disguise my voice a little bit okay and

just be like excuse excuse me did did

you see uh madam Valencia I went she

drops the chamber pot and run screaming

down the stairs for calling the other

servants she she's obviously absolutely

terrified at what she just heard yeah

Diaz just adores like I wasn't that bad

was I

you turn around expecting somebody to be

there like nobody's there to hear you

yeah yeah that's fine huh this is

bizarre I gotta go I would like to turn

to the rest of my crew posthaste

you're heading out through the window I

take it yeah alright I'll go back down

through that window that came in through

the first place just two or mmm no hmm

hmm take that back I'm actually gonna

wait a few moments to try to observe and

listen for where that chamber maiden

went okay you hurt yeah you heard her go

downstairs and she's talking to she's

she's talking to what might be a butler

or a valet saying that she heard what

she thinks is a ghost in the

conservatory possibly of Master Rosner

the late master Rosner master Roger

stark yeah and then yeah it's around

that time death as you're listening that

you realize that the bats have stopped

flapping you don't hear them anymore

oh good what I'm gonna poke my head back

up there just make sure there are still

bats and I'm not going insane yeah when

you go up there you can see that the

bats are still in the Attic but they

have all quietly roosted on rafters and

on the rooftop they're just like little

little black hanging sacs of soft supple

leather II flesh their wings right

tightly around their body that's

adorable

okay so they're all asleep I am going to

stealthily ascend into the Attic it's

definitely stealthy when you make your

way to the open coffin and you look

inside it you see that it is empty

except for a thin crust of Earth upon

which rests the shredded stuffing 'less

skin of a straw doll

I'm sorry I'm sorry the what of a straw

doll the outer the outer skin of a straw

doll that is missing all of its stuffing

in innards it's just a flat straw doll

skin cool i I just I like fries at that

site and it's just like immediate dread

like it's a flight or fight and getting

fries and then I'll very very carefully

kind of just reach in to grab the

remnants of the straw doll okay and you

do okay good

close-up pupule behind me what I miss

are we dead cool so death you have been

keeping this secret to yourself now for

weeks you're sitting in the Waffle House

remembering remembering this incident

playing it over in your mind over and

over and over again the finding of the

doll skin for weeks Alton is just like I

can't metagame too much but I know you

know something

all right okay so you've been you've

been sort of sitting on this with a you

know obviously this the discovery would

cause widespread terror you've obviously

been making sure that the Waffle House

is secure and everybody everything you

know people are your friends are able to

get things get their together

without dumping some horrible horrible

truth upon them where would you like to

keep the skin of this dot of a straw

doll somewhere in my own private chamber

um I have my own personal lock box

that's locked that's right but does not

have a key but I don't think I would

paint those mementos with this king of a

straw doll okay so I would likely keep

it certainly during the reconstruction

of the Waffle House you could have had

another like secret chambermaid within

the walls or floor or ceiling of your

room if you so wish I don't think I make

him an extra one look at it I would

probably put it like I would

wherever my bed is I would actually

probably pin it between the wall in the

bed okay all right and there it has

remained at some point like palton like

we'll walk by his room and just like

when he's in there and just violently

knock like come out here come out here

now quickly scramble being what they

looked Clair's Adam he's just like you

know this house is now built on honesty

after we had that therapy session right

right hold it right let me get her right

Paulson you know that death was

unusually reticent during the therapy

session reticent you know reserved not

ready to divulge much information

I don't know what Strix is doing right

now

I suspect that she's got her bakery up

and running so it is it is kind of late

spring and late spring is customarily a

time of kind of rebirth for the city of

Waterdeep as people sort of get about

their daily lives but weather-wise it is

one of the most temperamental seasons

and it has been a mixture of nice

warming weather but also heavy rains and

thick fogs and they thick a thick fog

came into Waterdeep Harbor about a day

and a half ago and has basically just

been creeping its way up into the city

ever since I would like to continue this

conversation with DF you wouldn't hide

anything from me right right yes opens

the door up a little bit I would ruin

your day okay because I can't help and

notice that this is much more empty than

I last remember and if you've been

getting in my stash you could just ask

yeah it opens the door a little bit like

looks past Maltin to see if Strix is

nearby later in the day or is it earlier

in the day uh let's say for the sake of

argument it's fairly early in the day

okay if it's early in the day then she's

gonna be probably setting up things

downstairs getting everyone working and

blah blah blah and did did you give her

the feather that he enchanted yet I'm

sure yeah okay and she has it in her

hair nice Oh

evylyn is off at the temple dealing with

temple business you the only thing you

know that she told you it was that

there's somebody arriving from out of

town some priest of great repute and so

and there's also various masses and

vigils and things happening at the

temple right now and her presence is

requested and required okay so after

peaking past them to see if Strix in

nearby at all and she's not there

Deus will then like grab paltin and like

pull him into his bedroom and shut the

door

[Laughter]

and just like already fine

look yes fine I just I didn't want

anyone else to panic I didn't want them

to get scared or do something irrational

but I mean I'm a little upset that she

took some wine but I mean it's it's not

that big a deal you see anyone else and

your poignant lis talking about yeah

mostly yes I mean even a little bit to

video yeah so we'll just be like it's

not that was hiding anything for anyone

I was just trying to find a good way to

process it and figure out how we can

handle this cuz I just don't know what

it means and EF will go to his bed

it's not like it's seriously just wine

it's not him not a big deal like I don't

have to make this whole thing home I'm

not talking about wine this conversation

was never about wine oh she was probably

squiggly a little punk-ass oh no that

was me but EF will pick up the remnants

of the straw doll and just be like

Oh Shh okay

schwa Shh all right um we're we're

reciting our daily alphabet we're not

having secret meetings that was uh that

was I was it was a pleasure

oh it's getting raunchy in here don't

come in okay good

Strix when you go downstairs there is a

stranger in the bakery looking at the

display of pastries breads pies and

other goods that you have for sale and

Vivica would you be so kind as to

subscribe how as vallei Rajan are had it

presents herself when she arrives here

for the first time well when you first

walk in I have my back to you I have

like a large dark cloak on as I assume

it's probably getting a little chilly

with that dang fog and you see my fort

with the cloak and a very delicate

elegant hand picking up a pastry turning

it in her hand looking at it very just

oh it's just you hear her say oh this is

just so quaint oh thank you crickets in

it for the kobolds

and you can see she looks she turns and

looks at you and you can see the moments

of her eyes where she realizes what you

had said and she puts it back down and

kind of just wakes her hand a little bit

and she's like I I'm sorry I shouldn't

touch without asking but um but yes your

door was just open oh good to know

but yes hello I am

and she kind of does a nice elaborate

little mystical curtsy

Oh tricks doesn't know how to answer

that so she just like very rigidly

boughs like eight I kept my my curtsy

and like looked up at you and just kind

of nodded a little and came back up you

can see that I am I am dressed well but

my clothing and it's actually I was

wondering if she kind of like looks

around like to see if there's anyone

else and uses prestidigitation to just

close the door so Strix goes stopping up

the spiral staircase to the upper level

heading back toward EFS room leaving as

filet alone downstairs know we're taking

a while here we're we're taking our time

it's bad lady or a good lady what do you

live here

you like turns to deities like is there

someone else

it's a little bit far to hear that

convert you probably hear Strix this

voice because it sort of cuts through

the walls

exactly but you can only hear kind of

like murmurings and maybe the odd

shuffling of feet or the the groaning of

floorboards and actually in this moment

while while you're registering keeping

abreast of all those noises in the hopes

that DF will present himself you also

start to feel a little exposed in this

large room with its many windows looking

at in all directions and you start to

sort of unconsciously pull the block the

drapes shut and maybe even take the

liberty of like turning the open sign

closed and putting the bar over the

front or des will take the remnants of a

straw doll and just quickly stashed away

in probably one is pouches okay I'm on

his personal packs just quick puts it

away

[Laughter]

[Laughter]

opens the the door like very quickly

just thank you Strix I thank you yeah

odd but D Ethel starts going downstairs

but not before he takes a moment to turn

back to the two of them and just remind

them that lady Rajan R was the friend of

Captain ordem a when we had the shift

wrong

[Music]

I always check because people asked for

you it's probably someone that wants

money from us or to kill us this might

still be the same thing all right cool

all right so death will go down stairs

okay and you see lady rush NAR for the

first time down in the bakery

waiting great taking a chair and moved

it to like the very corner of the room

so my back is up against the walls and I

can clearly see all of the doors and

windows now one of the chairs in this

room lady Rosner is far superior to the

others in terms of its decor and it's

gothic awesomeness it almost looks like

it almost looks like a velvet-lined even

wooded throne well be sure it was happy

but I had sometimes the structure and I

go did I go down there as well that's up

to you are you following the eff down

yeah I want to see it here right yes

then the three of you all see this

this woman was well presented figure

sitting on Strad von cherubic in a

corner of the room so that she can see

the entirety of the bakery before her

cool can i and can I animate the chair

just to like topple over and dump her

out yes you do have that power as Valais

you are shocked very suddenly as a young

dark-haired man coming down the spiral

staircase narrows his eyes at you

Wiggles are just basically hums a little

few bars of a tune and suddenly the

chair tries to heave you out of it hey

I'm very surprised

it takes me in kind of like pops me up

yeah you're surprised I catch myself I

do not follow at all and I thought very

gracefully tip tapping on my yes yes

yeah chair yes yeah that's all I care

about

okay slowly sit and cross my legs and

vehicles start approaching her and I'll

just say I apologize that's it's Paul

tunes favorite chair and he's got this

whole thing about it we have a very

special relationship

I apologize I had no idea I not used to

such an curiosities it is entirely my

mistake I came into your home and I

touched your pies i sat in your chair

he's still eating the corner bones just

like no no it's okay

I guess he looked at the chairs like

there's an openness that we did not

discuss apparently in the near future

speaking the entire time death is just

discerning her to see if she resembles

any particular no no apparition he may

have seen within the past few weeks

oh yes just make a perception or insight

your choice

definitely perception then her visit

just familiar to you

not necessarily because you recognize

that in the veiled woman you spoke to

but because you're pretty sure you saw a

painting of her on the wall of the

staircase that the chambermaid was

walking down okay

all right enough confirmation for me yep

anyways before and chair boy hello it's

wonderful to meet you

and she has to both of them and then she

turns and she's like oh you are death

will take her hand like I am death would

row oh oh so nice to meet you she keeps

her hand there yes guy like takes it

just shakes it a little bit yes

astral a lady ROG dar oh it's fine

I'm not something house doesn't matter

right you can definitely call me as

delay all right yes fillet yeah I've

been meaning to speak with you for some

time ever since we had returned to water

deep I would have got love to find you

sooner but sadly our paths just not did

not cross in time our house was

destroyed like seven times

yeah but you have house problems and she

just kind of glazed over a little if she

looks kind of past you and she's like

yes indeed I do but I'm sorry we haven't

been around unfortunately I've been

predisposed yeah yeah well s Billy lady

art I only wish to say that it was

thanks to your close friend captain

automated that we returned from salt

back to water deep and we would not have

made it back here without him and we

forever hurt her our thanks and our

lives thanks to her and with that is

with my heavy heart that I must relate

to you that she lost her life and that

voyage bringing us home with the Pegasus

my she looks around for a chair to sit

in

[Laughter]

I'm so sorry Strix could you get her

something to drink

inquisitive and she's like whatever has

Colville guests cou have to provide for

everyone

pour make later I like hot toddy yep

well while you do that the Alby or

albino gazer measure beholder who spends

most of his time just sort of hovering

around in the kitchen doing stuff he

helps his best he can and might actually

kind of because he's kind of a little

degenerate just sort of just kind of

yeah it's sort of drools in the cup of

it okay you can do that it might

actually have some healing properties

who knows yeah thank you Chris I still

have I still at the hand right you

Ziller out yeah it's as as paltin was

just kind of sitting in the chair just

like listening like a little like hand

just crawls up and just just chills on

Paul in the shoulder when that happens

as velay you see that the severed hand

appears to be a withered sort of

blackened with aged hand it's not clear

at a glance what the hand came from but

definitely a humanoid my like my breath

catches in my throat and I guess a

little and I reached out and I grabbed

its arm like what kind of hands

oh that's hand drew mmm he's chill yeah

I wasn't really speaking of its own

personality creature did it come from

oh it's um doesn't matter it's not

theirs anymore even a little like fist

bump

but she's made now hot toddies for

everyone and floating behind Strix you

see is this small grapefruit-sized

beholder white with sort of miss shape

and features drool coming out of the one

corner of its mouth and four stumpy

little eye stalks looking around my grip

on his arm policies into this thing and

she puts she puts my cups down in front

of them and water from paulson and you

noticed that they're now boiling like

like boiling on fire and she just like

sits down like he's the boiling cup he's

just like yeah I'm gonna give that like

an extra five minutes it's this see

that's beliefs tricks it's safe it's

just mumbling to herself as if a lady

looks around at the group she looks at

the hand she looks its tricks that

inside you know grumbling she looks at

the beholder and she she pulls herself

up brushes her skirt off marches right

over picks up one of the cricket pies

eyes straight to Strix it keeps one

little mmm

gross just like a little cricket foot

that's like good I guess so uh if I may

ask you come into our home

and I just want to know what are your

what are your intentions with our boy DF

well he came into my home looking for me

yeah I was just trying to find her yep

you've been sneaking out at night no

guys we talked about this misterx is

like lying on the ground like have you

been going out without telling us I do

you think NORs them and just turns back

to that s movie just that I just there's

anything that you we can do for you for

captain Orton made that's please let us

know but jokes out and grabs his hands

at Hearst well actually because um I

can't help notice as I look around I

have been in need of well a certain a

certain type of adventure I suppose and

sometimes the situation just presents

itself I do need your help actually and

this would go a far way of making me

feel better about thief's untimely death

like his hands being held he's just like

yeah what what is it that you need well

she turns around and checks over her

shoulders again feeling again exposed

and kind of still holding your hands

kind of pulls you back towards a wall a

little bit away from the window I took a

pickle I'm currently in hiding there are

some who wish to do me and my family

harm in fact it is it

unfortunately why I was unable to meet

receive when you came to look at me look

at me look for me but this is also like

right behind you now getting some real

vibes you can just smell how bad she

smells like right there I'm gonna do my

best to push through that stifle your

gag reflex yeah I I need to certain

items that I just do not think that I

can obtain myself

the lady nobility and happy to know the

can-do attitude that you and I look over

my shoulder and friends I

actually need at that point at that

point everything in the room goes dead

silent but we can't like voices yeah her

voice is completely just now just can I

read lips and every every sound is just

completely muted like the entire room is

in a silence spell I started running

around in circles you see Paulding is

like trying to scream over he's like

like takes her staff and turns it into

the magical like will and in the air

rights this spell magic

and points of paulsen I I noticed none

of this and I'm still just like talking

idea

the earth is looking around very

confused because first he thought it was

just him just paltin like look sad yet

he's just like I'm so used to people

letting me talk I'm still going okay I

guess we'll do usually has like a

writing utensil or a quill or parchment

or something because he has always been

a studious note-taker mm-hm

he can also take the one from Strix his

hair yeah well you wouldn't touch that

one she's gonna grab that real fast and

then just hand it to Lady Rosner and

just kind of like motion to like write

it down and while she does that I'm

actually gonna try to peek through some

of the window blinds or you think Missy

if there's anyone or anything nearby who

could have caused this because it was

none of us right and he starts opening

up the blinds I'm very distracted by

that I am very nervous I'm peeking over

his shoulder outside I see like leaves

the window I close the blinds again yes

as you look out you see that the the fog

of spring has pretty much clouded the

troll skull alley you can see out about

maybe 20 30 feet and it seems sort of

deathly quiet except maybe often just on

the periphery of the edge of your view

you see dark shapes this is just people

just making about their daily business

oblivion oblivious to the current

situation affecting you you don't hear

them they don't seem at all drawn toward

you they just carry on about their

business got it so it's just just in

here

is this familiar I will start looking

around - for someone who cast the spell

at Alton's not casting counterspell even

though I've written it like 15 times and

not in the air oh it's like written or

not Kent yeah it's like in the air it

says this says dispel magic don't County

small you have to spell Nets and now I'm

sorry to say you have to spell magic I -

you deal what Talton you know that

dispel magic has a verbal component

which won't work in a silence there's

like no you see Paul and silent you

silently just like the rich God the

basement real fast from the cellar yeah

see if area the silence affects the

other floors as well okay when you open

the hatch you're shot a a something

comes up out of the darkness and hits

you magic gun your but you don't hear it

you just feel it I scream in pain oh no

you you all see as death opens the hatch

to the basement him suddenly just sort

of fly backward as if hit with some

terrible force no and you take 20 points

of damage from that shot and deaath you

feel like some of that is poison working

through your system uncanny dodge you

take ten calls but still please yeah

there's not even like a save on the

poison reasoning on there's no save on

the poison that's good poison that's bad

boy isn't

uh okay yep yep yep okay so after being

shot and stumbling backwards we should

roll initiative Hey 25:25 4df 17 do i

yeah you do you do have your weapon on

you I'm doing this all right all those

guys

5 what 5 paltin sorry I got 17 ok strix

okay Allen also turns to her is just

like in dead sounds just like dammit

I roll 25 okay you're first

great see the hatch door is open

alright so after something back from

getting shot Dee Ethel stand up withdraw

a gutter and then check his shot wound

is there like a bolt or arrow there no

it is you see the hole you see the hole

and you think you were shot with

something small and incredibly painful

almost like an intensely fired sling

stone I feel so good also just for the

sake of fairness just the points in the

fact at the start of my turn and in my

turn in effect it happened it actually

is an instantaneous poison the effect is

now ended

oh okay so just extra damage yeah I wish

was a poison damage again I'm sorry so

in total with the width and that the the

projectile and the poison together ended

up doing 10 points of damage to you

because of your on Kenny dodge okay God

just wanna make sure I have that right

okay well that's not good

again the others see me like oh yes

weapon out yes Dada da foolish like

point too

the Aoi and then point tourists the

hatchery or to the cellar and then yeah

and then I'm just gonna frickin leap

right on down there it's gum look real

cool okay

like name use ladder just yep

when you drop down into the cellar make

a perception check at disadvantage Oh

still gonna be a with cuz I got my

reliable talent so it's gonna be at 21

great you can see in the Ale cellar that

you've just left into standing one

standing right near you is a dark elf

with a device in his hand the likes of

which you have not seen before it has

almost wand like but has a strange

curved handle and his finger is on some

sort of trigger like mechanism and

there's smoke coming out of the end of

it well I hate this there is another one

standing in another corner oh jeez

with a loaded weapon oh it's got one of

those thingies - yeah oh alright

and it's just the two of them though as

far as you can see great can I hear

things down here no damn it dead silent

that's awful okay down here facing off

between the two of em I am going to take

the defensive action okay and just get

ready to dodge the other guys gonna do

great

they go right now the one standing in

front of you who fired at you on the

surprise round seems to does he do let

me just double-check this

yeah sorry I just need to look this up

very quickly sky look up to see how bad

this is gonna be all right

he will keep the weapon that he has in

one hand but draw a short sword and

attempt to stab you with that twice all

right

and he rolls a 19 and an eleven that

with the disadvantage for my defense oh

I'm sorry you're right I forgot about

that yeah so he rolled an 11 and a 20

oh okay the 20 still hits okay but

doctor what a cool pair reasons yeah

no you will take 19 points of damage as

you see that some of that too is also

poison mm-hmm okay got it

and then his buddy will shoot at you

silently with his weapon and he's a

disadvantage too

he rolled in 18 total oh that hits as

well okay then oops

nurse says he does 22 points of damage

total all right a LAN kini dodged that

one you take 11 good still aus all right

and then the third one that you didn't

see oh come on

becomes visible and tries to assassinate

you from underneath the stairs with his

short sword he's got advantage of

disadvantages neutralized

I die and DF some some preternatural

instinct of yours tipped you off cuz

even though you couldn't hear him in the

dead silence something there was just

some moment where you slipped out of his

grasp and his

weapon does not find purchase that's

right which I which is lucky because

that would have been bad this part is

like I know these droughts asked nations

work and now it is Strix is turn tricks

you have heard nothing

DF just went down into the hatch well I

literally can't cast any I lost them

[Music]

you

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

you

[Music]

and we're back and everything's okay we

discovered that Strix can't cast any

spells in the silence so that's good

that's good it's her turn so what i can

do is i can transform my staff so i will

scuttle up to the hole that deep jumped

into you see him engaged in combat with

one drow at the foot of the stairs okay

and I would like to hover my little my

lantern wall away now it's a feather

turn it into a cauldron and drop it on

top of this drought just like throw it

on top of him yeah like I'm gonna just

drop it on him okay well he's you're

gonna have to kind of hurl it down the

stairs over death to hit the drow

because death is between you and the

drow so go ahead and make an improvised

range of attack it's a d20 plus your

dexterity bonus yeah go ahead

add your dexterity bonus okay

that's a 14 okay so it's the drow seize

the cauldron coming and dodges out of

the way and it silently strikes the

floor of the cellar and goes tumbling

off into the darkness I like to imagine

it was like slowly floating towards him

i I want them to see me yelling Pike off

and gesturing really okay that they can

do okay and then it is Paul Tain's turn

felt okay so I'm going to cast

invisibility on myself okay and then can

I run down there and see what I see you

can indeed oh and when you go down there

make a perception check actually

invisibility has verbal components Oh

I thought it was just touch no verbal

somatic material you're out of luck no

no okay all right then I'm just gonna

does you see here Thunder Wave doesn't

have her ball does it dude I don't think

you know let's find out I don't see

anything well there is that if thunder

goes off in a silence can anything

happen so yes it does have verbal as a

matter of fact cool almost all spells do

by the way it's so I'm I'm super certain

that none of my spells will really work

being a bard this is where this is your

curse man silence is not barred friendly

true normally I love it okay

well then I guess if no spells are

working I'll just I'm like trying to do

stuff I'm just like now you do have one

spell that you've been concentrating on

that's still up and that's your animate

object fine I I'm gonna tell the chair

to just roll on down there and kill the

first thing that isn't deaffit see I'm

trying all this stuff they look to the

chair I'm just like and you can see the

chairs like tapping silently expectantly

waiting for some command all right so

you send the chair down the stairs DF

you don't hear it coming but three

through some sort of back light up in

the room above you you do see something

coming down you think it's gonna be your

friends and suddenly you see strug you

see the dark silhouette of strawed von

karevik at the top of the staircase and

then it comes stomping down toward you

miss like misty back light beams just

like silhouetting it just like like this

is your savior is it chair alright and

so I roll a d20

palton and add five for the chair

attack roll a 23 that hits the drow it

does okay it does 2d 6 plus 1 points of

damage just 10 ok does 10 points of

first damage to the drought organ Beauty

and the Beast

so this drow is silently assailed by

this Gothic chair even Paul's looking at

is just like alright and then it is s

fillets turn so I I go over and I I've

seen cauldrons getting thrown down there

I have seen chairs running off in their

feet down you see a DF and a chair

battling a drow at the bottom of the

staircase in the dark and the otherwise

dark cellar I everyone can see me

silently say something that is just so

not ladylike and I I uh appear and jump

down I am I'm just gonna attack this uh

I'm going to work my way around the

chair and I am going to attack via that

first dragon I see okay right so you you

can make your attack starting with your

first one yes so the first one is 40

that that the drought dodge is out of

the way of that

oh by the way you have advantage because

you have an alibi fighting next to it so

you were all to dice it

I didn't add my addition to it so that

was actually a 21 that hits second one

is a 26 that hits your alling these

Titanic dice that sounds like just like

yeah all right big giant no it's great

that's lovely so you you hit twice and

you can use your sneak attack if you

want to on your first attack yep and

this knee and the sneak attack damage

only applies to one attack I'll actually

no that's a total lie my mistake you get

it on both no no I'm right you won once

per turn sorry yeah sorry I can read

[Music]

okay 19 well then okay okay and that

drow is now bloodied that's the one at

the bottom of the stairs fighting death

the chair and when as well he leaps into

battle DF you can see that she is very

recent skilled with the blue with the

rapier making three stab E's and getting

the drought once really good between the

blades of his shoulders she is far more

capable than I expected the third time I

only missed because I was checking over

my shoulder to assess your damage okay

like you'd know if you could hear what

she was saying to you but

yeah absolutely these strikes just

throwing her a cauldron at the drought

feeling like miserably and going alright

the the drow exchange hand signs with

each other

surprisingly calmly just given the

current situation and intensity of

what's going on D F and s valet you know

what they're saying because you speak

the language yep and they are saying

let's turn our attacks on her she must

have the stone in her possession and so

they all shift there they all shift

toward s valet D F what do you do okay

so the one that the chair was fighting

was that the bloodied one yes okay great

because I want a combo attack with this

 chair okay so on the chair as

it's Italian actually like I bike bolt

over the chair and using this high it

allows me to vault like like based like

moonsault over the the drow himself so I

can land behind him and then sneak

attack excellent about it even though he

can't say anything like after like the

hand signs happen paltin just like ah

they're activating their jutsu I roll a

21 hit a mini dice come on impress me

one second

42 what all right

yeah he had 42 hit points left so yes

how do you want to do this

yeah it's just like the moonsault over

the chairs so EF comes down and lands

behind him but it's like facing his back

uh-huh and then it's just like Pierce

right through the chests I seems like

it's all the way through said there's no

more blades and is to twist and then

pulls out so that is the moment he pulls

out like the drow just falls to the

floor yeah and then uh Diaz can like do

a quick swipe to this blade like get all

the blood off of it and then turn

towards the others it still hurt holding

his wounds very good as the drought dies

and the blade rips out from his torso he

spews a gout of blood all over your face

and neck as valet but you're not at all

troubled or distressed by this death row

sorry

in fact given given the satisfaction

with which you see the life leave his

eyes you're probably just like all right

okay you can't hear him but Paul's like

oh my hokage little heart little hearts

fly in the air I don't get the team

attack very often Pelton so I'll take

what I can get all right

the two remaining Dark Elves one of them

is going to shoot as hell a rolling and

you see something something must have

happened to his weapon because it didn't

go off and now he's looking at it and

obviously angry that something has gone

wrong with the mechanism his friend

darts over from the corner and tries to

stab you twice but apparently their

dexterity has completely failed them on

this round as well a and they he

practically trips and stumbles his way

over the dead corpse of his friend and

the chair that is basically taking up a

great deal of space

it wasn't silent they could hear me

laughs indeed and that brings us to

Strix all right I watched this whole

exchange with anger and grossed out oh

it's gross do I see her enjoy the blood

enjoy it I'm suspicious that's all I'm

saying

she just picked up she just seems a nerd

to it like you know it's not the first

time she's seen a lot real blurry

okay well Strix is just like and then

I'm going to I was still impressed by

the cherry antics but I'm gonna go down

and go grab my cauldron okay when you do

you will to get down the stairs and get

your cauldron you will provoke an attack

of opportunity from the drow who is

accosting as halay with his sword and I

can't misty step we check the spell I

think it's got a variable I've been

checking them all I'm pretty sure I

can't do anything misty step is a verbal

so now everything is bad it sucks okay

yeah all right I'll just I'll get

stabbed it's fine okay I'm just gonna

run by just like stab me it's fine

just like stab me fair enough

he ruled any 7:17 on the attacker all

right oops wrong day so it's going to do

21 points of damage including poison

damage to you ow

and and you slipped by and you grab your

heavy cauldron what do you do next all

right I will you got it by the handle

okay I will turn it into the frying pan

and hate the drow on the back of the

head all right

there's okay make it at that girl over

the head with bull three inches yep

go and take away okay so you sort of

swing wildly spinning around in the

silence but you don't actually connect

yes that's what I do and I look really

stupid I'm pretty sure that everyone in

the room is going to judge me paltin

yeah you're at the top of the stairs

with Han drew you're you can continue to

command your chair to assail these foes

okay more you can do some other action

huh

what was the it's a bonus action by the

way to mentally command the chair so Oh

even better

okay well I'm gonna go so I'm at a point

where I did I see the drow like at the

stairs like making these attacks or do I

still have no idea it's there you see

another drow has entered this entered

the scene that you can see at the bottom

of the stairs after the first drow fell

he came and tried to kill as velay okay

and you know and you know there's one

under the stairs because mmm yeah that's

the one I want to go for so I'm gonna go

for my action I'm gonna I guess use the

Sun sword okay and I'm gonna try and

stab this boy it becomes very bright in

the room and then this laser sword this

light sword goes slamming down through

the wood between the wooden slats of the

stairs at the dark elf make an attack

roll alright so that is +2 14 14 does

not it's cool well I get annoyed and I'm

gonna command the chair to go attack

that one alright yes the chair can sidle

over under the stairs and start wailing

on this guy make another attack role of

+5 to hit okay

ooh 21 that hits through 26 plus 1 for

damage why is why is the chair better 11

very good first damage this guy's taking

this chair silently accosting this drum

and then I see this and I just look at

the chair and I look at the story I look

at the chair and I just slowly put the

sword away the blade goes out goes dark

and you just pocket the hilt all right

and then as early as a ballet you have a

foe next to you and DF and Strix this is

the one that I tried to attack you last

round and did not score a hit well let's

see if I can return the favor I am going

to reel back my rapier again start

slightly I used more gentle die this

time in my nose I okay so that is a 26

hit natural 20 all right 212 ok the 12

is a Miss but you scored a crit so that

will do double dice damage and you can

you can apply the crit to your sneak

attack further around 45 good lord all

right that's the first that's the crit

all right yes but the first attack alone

bloodied him and then you just put an

extra sauce on what the second hit and

dealt him a wound that will probably

leave a scar if he survives and

then oh dear we're back to DF so DF

you're down to two adversaries one of

whom just took a hideous blow from ESMA

lay the other one is being accosted

under the stairs by Strad vaughn

cherubic you're closest to the former

what would you like to do rob me to go

for the one that s wooly just hit some

guys I'd rather be able to remove more

threats while you can okay yeah so that

shot chair is distracting that guy

I'll go to the one that s Pillai was

messing up and then tried to try to get

a girl stabbed in him good all right

you have advantage okay great that's

neat yes it is it's no creek but it's a

lot of dice

that's three ones 35 all right

you kill him right so again another one

goes splashing down in in bloodbath and

slumps on the floor it's life Exedy have

one of those weird looking stick

thingies he does that all three of them

do have these weird weapons okay I think

the pad of paper that I was given

earlier and I write really quickly i

softened him up for you and I shove it

into your hand okay he one crumpled it

and look at his like do you think is

your face like what does it matter

and then I Casas it away all right

uh-huh and then it is the bad guys turn

there's one left

oh all right so the writing is on the

wall so as his friends blood and he

pulls out a vial drinks it and turns

invisible so the one that the chairs

attacking on the stairs suddenly

disappears

all right and then it is strict cistern

so there's there's one there's one

drought down here Strix but you can't

see him now all right

do any of them did the little that one

has a jaunty hat five chance yeah okay

just curious

alright well I'm just gonna swing wildly

with my frying pan at hope I hit up go

ahead and make an attack make an attack

roll with this it disadvantage on your

attack roll please nothing to make me

happier

oh man if I just I got a natural twenty

and a fourteen okay no you don't so

sadly the invisibility denies you your

prize you go swinging in the area where

you think he is but there's nothing

there you sure did and then palton

you're on the stairs you can't see the

drow any more that your chair was

attacking what do you do now you know

that there are only two ways out of this

cellar one is through a gate leading

down into the source which is probably

how they got in here and the other is up

the stairs past you so okay ferry fire

is also verbal right it is yes okay so

that's cool so what I'm going to do

since I know that let's see so okay so

there's the stairs which I'm kind of

like at the top at and then there's the

gate where they probably came in from

right down in the cellar yeah

is that you can't I can't see the gate

from here unless you sort of crouched

down on the stairs and kind of look down

at an odd angle be half behind you what

I would that could I do that without

using my action yes just as part of a

move you could can I like look down to

see if the gate looks like it's just

been opened you can

and you do notice that it is currently

hanging open so from that I had assessed

that he probably left potentially or

they left it open when they entered okay

well just in case as my action I'm gonna

take the Sun sword back out and then

just swing directly in front of me

alright make an attack role because that

your because the potential targets

invisible you have disadvantaged so roll

two dice and take the lower result

frying pan flailing sons also before he

does that and also before he does that

he doesn't say it cuz there's no sound

bite thanks to himself he looks up the

soaring goes oh right finesse that would

have been so with that in mind with your

dexterity applied yeah okay is it plus

just the dexterity or also your

proficiency bonus so yeah so your as a

tenth level character you have a

proficiency bonus plus three four plus

four plus your dexterity so that's a

dirty twenty all right so that's even

with disadvantage right mm-hmm okay you

actually cut into him because he was

trying to get past you so something I'm

like oh yeah so the silence the silence

ring your surprise is is is drowned out

by the spell but everyone can see it

nonetheless earlier damage okay okay

cool so twelfth okay so the rest of you

can see the radiant blade cut into

something fleshy and splatter blood all

over the stairs and also you smell burnt

drow flesh and know

and then whatever it is seems to try to

push its way past paltin and continue

running up the stairs leaving a trail of

blood behind it

good Holly I would like you to make for

me or no sorry never mind I have to make

this roll okay right I think so yeah

so clearly after paltin stabbed whatever

this invisible drow it continued to run

up past him and is now up in the bakery

somewhere and it is as valets turn your

quarry is well yeah I'm going to so so

the the drow is invisible but it's

leaving a trail of blood that I can see

yes love it yeah I'm going to finish

what we started I'm gonna pop right up

those stairs with the quickness and see

if I can catch up to this

hopefully limping slow drought all right

as you follow the trail you can see that

the drow is clearly trying to make its

way around actually it probably leaps

over the counter probably spilling a

little bit of blood on the glass and

maybe even on some of the pies and then

is making its way to the door you can

follow easily enough and make an attack

because you even though you can follow

the blood trail you still can't see it

so you have disadvantage on your attack

roll rolls those doors that's true yes

you did yeah I not seem to work for them

I'm going to run up on the trail of

blood and just kind of yeah finesse

finis Flair it's really good no okay so

the first one is a 21 okay and next one

is a 19

and then 8:50 no the third one that I

just I it's a bum shoulder from college

I just can't get that through hidden so

you can you hit twice then so go ahead

and give me your damage ah do I need to

see the person that's 14 okay you can't

hear anything but you do you do feel

you're the end of your weapon piercing

flesh there's no indication that you

have killed your quarry no big splash of

blood on the floor no weird outlines

that would suggest a bodily form has

fallen at your feet and it is DF Stern

all right so I'm gonna use my cutting

action to - so I get extra movement and

then I'm just gonna also chase after

this guy okay see where s Malay was

previously attacking it yeah hit him

yeah so I'm going to use most of my

women to catch up to them okay make it

AK and then use the rest of my movement

to stand in front of the door got it go

ahead and make your attack alright so

this is sort disadvantage though it's

the disadvantage is negated by as valets

presence so it's just a normal attack

role regular attack oh that's actually

good 26 cents a head and you get your

sneak attack alright sneak attack dude

the ally

10 11 13 17 20 22 26 30 35 okay for the

third time in as many rounds deaath

fells assassinates a drow in courser and

you're pretty sure that this drow is

dead because of the blood pouring

strangely around his body now lying on

the floor does he do after death he is

still visible okay so after like DF like

kind of stabs him and then like when he

feels like died but dying slumped down

just kinda like Falls with it and then

like pulls a sword out it's kinda like

flops over no like bleeding and stuff

from his wounds

alright we are out of combat and after

about another I want to say eight or

nine minutes the silence ends and as

soon as it ends I point out that yes you

may have caught the killing blow strikes

would like to go and use mending on that

gate okay yeah good so yeah they

basically just they use their thieving

ability to pick the locking mechanisms

so you just have to you just really have

to close it and relock it okay and then

when I see the blood on the pies I'm

gonna be like bone goes down to Straub

on cherubic and like meals to him he's

just like you did good but that'll do

and gives him once to try and get more

oh my leg close up just yeah alright I

guess deaath bandages himself no strix

was gonna go up and after she cried

about the pies go up and heal him okay I

should have loved priorities life

we have debt to repay okay yeah

yeah I'll just do let's see a pretty

high as well yeah thank you

okay that's five d8 + 426 points back

alright like doubled what'd I hit just

has alright okay so I I looked around

and um okay awesome the bodies which I

have the bodies actually did that one

body like D cloak so eventually

eventually it will yes the potion will

wear off and it will form after it after

a fashion the other two of course are

visibly dead and you can see that

they're strange weapons are very unusual

and they seem to there's a smell about

them which is familiar to you DF palton

and Strix because you have kegs of the

stuff two of them

no one keg left I think tucked away

somewhere in this house yep Warrington

mine as well probably smells like it's

definitely a gunpowder weapon and with

Warrington were to see these he'd get

really excited oh hi we can hold on to

them maybe ask him about it in a bit

I want one s filet they said they're

after you about the stone do you have

the stone

i Sai and I kicked the invisible dead

body that's nice to me I'm like

unfortunately yes this is do to me this

is kind of what I was getting at when I

was telling you that I was indisposed

unfortunately the droughts been hunting

me and my family for some time it kind

of works out when you think of it though

because one of the things that I was

going to ask for your

[Music]

one of their hands so if this is

happening like quietly like yank one of

these mysterious weapons yeah if you

want to do it suddenly without your

friend seeing just make a slight of hand

check a dexterity sleight of hand you

don't have this those skills are just

dexterity Oh III have it I have it

whew okay

sixteen anybody who cares do can make a

perception check having a great time

sixteen okay you see it as well a palms

just like well guest npc said it's okay

what do you need the hand for I wasn't

playing as you say that Strix comes up

behind you holding this dripping bloody

hand as she mentions the possibility of

something lewd Paul I'm just kind of

like looks over two hand you're just

like

[Laughter]

but yes actually the hand is part of the

team I need a key

I know it's you know you know you know

things about keys yet Chris okay so I

have this piece I'm holding it by it's

like middle finger like which fantastic

I a so much of a productive day that I

was expecting but I do need one other

piece oh I'm sure he tricks it all of us

we can just we can obtain it so easily

I actually need and I stalk from a

beholder oh I have one of those you see

Albie sort of run away from like every

single holder we've killed yeah you you

you used up one of them but you still

have one left there rotting old I stock

that you took off yeah yeah oh we do

they have to be in good condition

that's time yeah so strix will run up in

and get it and and she'll hold it like

in Turpan just like boozing like just

rotting you take it she's gonna be like

what are these keys for well I am

visibly distressed and fumbling over my

words and very nervous and I insurance

reach out JP I stop now Oh what do you

want the keys for the more we know the

better we can protect you Oh which

[Laughter]

throws on the ground

laughter are you I'm with Strix on this

one why do you need these peculiar items

so badly and why did you require us to

get them for you I mean I'm happy to pay

my debts but yeah understand all seem so

suspicious during all this balton like

tries to fire the gun to see how it

works okay so there's a little pouch of

a little like packet of the black powder

that you've seen explode from time to

once so but I'm gonna have you make an

intelligence Arcana check okay ooh

dirty 20 okay good news is you don't

blow your face off

yeah so you you sort of figure out that

you can use the smoke powder and one of

these tiny little pellets that he's got

in a pouch together with this thing by

stuffing the pellet into the neck of the

weapon and then filling up this

compartment with smoke powder and then

kind of lighting a fuse with a flick of

a flint wheel you might be able to get a

shot off are you aiming at anything

particular just up in these up toward

the ceiling just kind of toward the

ceiling I'm like it lets out a

thunderous crack that can be heard all

throughout the house she's getting shot

palton does is he just like where do we

keep that powder

it's like jumps a little bit he's trying

to have his important conversation with

smle that's okay I can find it we're

gonna have to write this session up in a

couple minutes yeah I it wasn't so that

I was seeking you guys out

I was trying to have miss Jenkins turns

it's just honestly I've heard how great

adventurers you are and I just have a

soft spot for adventurers and I needed

help and I didn't know who else to turn

to so when you came calling to my house

it just and then I came here and then

you've got the hand and you've gotta

hold her in there it just seemed

serendipitous I but the the keys of her

am trying to get in this vault I she

looks around quickly and leaves in you

had been to my Manor you've seen the

state of things and my family is very

important to me and we have had a bit of

a checkered past which we are trying to

move on from but it is very hard for our

family for a title to recover from this

I have I am just trying to make sure

that my family is okay and try to bring

us back to the glory that we once knew

Irish I cannot do it alone and I am I'm

begging you she she chokes on those

words a little bit asking me begging you

delightful little monster girl to give
