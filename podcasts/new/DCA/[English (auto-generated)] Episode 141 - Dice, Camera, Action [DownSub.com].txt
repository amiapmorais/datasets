hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action

our little D&D show previously in the

campaign

d/f was confronted by representatives of

the most powerful dwarven clans of the

north who demanded reparations for the

deaths of their kin by DEA's hand when

he deliberately released a fire

primordial from inside an iron flask

later after returning to water deep and

a number of adventures got in the way

the waffle crew sought to acquire the

stone of galore a magic item that knows

the location of the vault of dragons

which is rumored to or is believed to

contain half a million gold coins that

were embezzled from the city by its

previous open Lord the water though the

water crew let's crunch stole the stone

as it was being auctioned off only to

have it stolen from them by imps loyal

to the castle enter noble family one of

the major powers in the city vying for

the stone paltin and Simon were gravely

wounded by these imps despite assurances

from the castle enters that no harm

would befall them or any other members

of the waffle crew that by order of

Asmodeus lord of the nine father of all

evil etc and so forth yeah you're home

with the rest of the waffle crew

awakened by a nightmare the details of

which are only vaguely reminiscent at

this point when you wake up you're in a

you're in a sweat sweat just pouring off

your brow and you remember basically in

the dream pulling dwarves up a

mountainside and they're all kind of

roped together

you alone are bearing their weight as

they try to claw and scramble up this

mountainside while mogera the fire Titan

is burning below them and you let go of

their open it burn your hand as as at or

free and you watch them all plunge into

mcGarry's mouth and that's when you woke

up and you don't remember what got you

to the mountain or how you ended up

being the anchor that was trying to hold

these dwarves and keep them from certain

death but their screams as they burnt to

cinders upon landing and mcGarry's mouth

was all you could take mr. dream

probably doesn't mean anything and then

when you wake up you are inside

Paul Toombs Magikarp Alton's magic

waffle hut which all of you have been

sleeping in ever since the upper floors

of the Waffle House were burnt to

cinders yes yes we have everybody else

is sleeping soundly around you and

there's just flexible snoring it's it

like early in the morning you're still

in the middle of the night or you

probably woke up in the morning okay oh

man yeah yeah

it's probably a bit earlier than deaath

is used to actually waking up but he'll

still do his kill tools just kind of be

grudgingly start his routine morning

routine calisthenics when he stepped out

of the waffle hut there's like a sound

as he passes through and then you can

hear the chickens in the kitchen just

making their usual rolls do we have real

chickens or just spectral chickens no

you have some real ones in the kitchen

not strix uses to get eggs that uses two

in her pastries and things like that

I had forgotten and anyway most of you

have taken to eating in the kitchen

because that room unlike the tap room

isn't in total shambles yeah and there's

a table in there and everything so you

probably prepare your breakfast as usual

with minimal help from Albie and the

invisible servants okay yeah okay

I imagine these these kinds of

nightmares death has been having for

quite some time and it's still probably

quite pretty resolved and doing what he

thinks is the right thing at least this

tricks here the noise when do you have

left the dome definitely not no so quiet

and sneaky fine she's still snoring um

you clean the dishes off you leave no

mess behind yeah I'll give a go actually

do like a quick walkthrough of the

entire house real fast just to see okay

make sure like everything is order

doesn't he feel anything suspicious and

at the same time is trying to recollect

events that have transpired and try it

slowly pieced together as I recall I'm

ready there were concerns that imps were

infesting the place very recently but it

was evylyn and her use of the Moonbeam

spell that kind of

incinerated one of them and scared the

others away as you make your way around

the house you don't hear things like

little flapping wings or the hairs on

the back of your neck don't tingle as

they sometimes do when danger seems to

descend upon you

okay now the upper floors are a mess

you're like climbing over burnt Timbers

and things like that but and this is

still just as broken this is got it

fixed and we didn't get to 2,000 gold

for selling a cloak so we need to do

that you also gave away something that

you gave to well not some of the money

that you were holding on to from a kink

as well yeah I mean a lot of debt you

say that out loud

the rest of you kind of wake up to that

downstairs you're not sure what was said

you just heard the voice and that was it

always yelling about money again it was

like drooling like oh I can't hear

anything in the Sun I should have been

up like three hours ago brushing her

hair out of her face what time is it oh

the I mean the the dawn Sun hasn't even

arisen above the horizon yet so it's

still pretty dark out through your dirt

stained windows what never sleeps but he

looks like half asleep she's like trying

to be awake when she's doing that thing

where her eyes are just like barely

awake and her hair's like this and

that's why she gets up so early because

she is not a person for like an hour so

she's like what what what do we need

money for you know comfort him in the

way that strix

tries to comfort people okay

you're able to find each other

eventually and as more people wake up

and the kids wake up you start to get

into the more hectic routine yeah

evylyn you go upstairs to the remnants

of your room and there's like a shard of

mirror that you've set up on a blackened

dresser what you're trying to use to

sort your hair there's like live laughs

[Laughter]

that's all that's left but yeah she

somehow figures it out and then she just

appears resplendent like good morning

happy to see you haven't seen you at all

this morning have I and this is just

this is just like the next day after

like the previous sessions right yeah

after this is the next day after your

visit to a kink okay

ooh paulsen how's the suit coming not

the suit you wear the suit like the

lawsuit Chris is it noon yet it can be

if there's no other business to attend

to

well if it just if it's not noon yet

then paulten has not okay

oddly specific well I mean I feel like

on a normal schedule he would never be

able before noon Oh gotcha oh god I got

something calls him to get up it's just

like no Elin was also used to just like

kind of yelling in his general direction

and not getting a response till noon so

she probably still said that it's a

little different because since you've

lost your individual rooms and you're

all sleeping down in the main room it's

a little harder for paltin to sleep in

when people are like stepping over him

and moving chairs around and I think I

don't know you drinking up you can sleep

for crew if anything it's more on

principle like he keeps his eyes closed

and doesn't move till near like that

this'll be like just to keep his sense

of normalcy mm-hmm I've done that

[Laughter]

well I think that Strix is going to

notice that well I don't know would

Sturtze known as the D it was distressed

hmm more than usual yeah yeah I was

gonna say like state of being yeah I

don't know I feel like if she noticed

that he had a bad dream I was stressed

or something she'd like go to the

kitchen and ask the coven for some I

don't know some calming tea or something

and bring him some tea I just feel like

24 24 hours ago diya thought he was

gonna have 50,000 gold pieces to spend

on this shambles of a residence no money

problems always always something have

stresses them out so Strix will just

bring him some tea and be like drink

this

Thank You Strix if we'll just take it

and sip at it yes yes one more drink

more I'll drink all of it when she takes

the cup when you're done thank you she's

cut off I was helping alright Strix he

realized that when you go down in the

kitchen and you're sort of you've gotten

accustomed to the sort of writing out

lists of pies that need to be made and

stuff like that and whether you do it

yourself or the other members

Chickenfoot come and do it you don't

really care but it just sort of gets

done you check them off on the done

problem is you're doing an inventory of

ingredients and you realize you have run

out of most of the ingredients you need

apart from the chickens to make the to

keep your pies going your business is

not going to be able to continue unless

you can order more supplies I like look

around like out of the kitchen I see a

CD if and like you see me think like

money troubles and we're not exactly

getting any business right now while

this whole place is in shambles

I don't know what to do I have spices I

take out my legs handy spice how to just

like this is not like that I can't make

eyes with this tiny bag I know I know

well do you think I sold my blood we

could make money probably but don't

Alton's gonna walk in step finally up

it's like death yeah you have paper Oh

always yeah okay need do find some

parchment in hand it to home

he's cool DF has like another 5 10

sheets of parchment left that he can

give to the palton well I'm running on a

parchment no like a materials and I'm is

it's a thing okay cool

I'm gonna start working on this case so

here's a sitting at the kitchen table

drawing up legal papers mmm-hmm to the

best of my ability which I don't know

how we can go about that tongue sticking

out I think

evylyn was probably looking over his

shoulder giving direction as well which

is like is that a word yeah and she's

but her she has some legal understanding

because she's been a paladin so long but

it's all based in like theology so she

wants him to add a lot of words that

have to do with like by the grace of God

all of those kinds of things because

she's like that's what makes it official

no no that's that's not the age water de

cuisine anymore weird people don't

people don't like that what do you mean

people don't like that they just they

just don't and I'm just trying to do

what's best for the case I I do

appreciate it it's very pretty gesture

you know it's like it's nice to think

that and I get it in fact I agree with

it

but you do yeah of course but for the

sake of the case I think and he's just

like big words lawyers it would behoove

us to yeah it'd behoove us to was to uh

to to know what but what's a fancier

word for leave out exclude exclude yes

that is the I was making sure we were on

the same page exclude the and realizes

that they were also out of T and the

come and it just put a bunch of weeds in

it the kids have put on their worst

clothing and are gonna vote panhandling

for the day hey everyone I'm going to

the castle address today I'm going to

I'm going to get this door I why because

we need it for what purpose I thought we

just destroyed that contract no I think

contractor II destroyed was the cloak

one we need the stone so that we can get

to this dragon horde before anyone else

and the last thing anyone should have it

be a bunch of Asmodeus worshiping rich

family because they can't hurt me I'm

not a fool they can't hurt any of you

I'm saying I don't want to go in I don't

want to go alone I'm I'm asking for help

you see Simon's dragic Javas hit the

floor everyone like motionless everyone

just albums pencil tape just like snaps

just look Strix you know more about like

the different hell's and rounds anyone

else

evylyn you know anything about like gods

with Angela and the light can help

protect you and the rest of us in

Paulding you can you can out talk anyone

I can't I can't do this I just a little

single tears glistening Andy's eyes of

course I will charisma casters unite

[Laughter]

well that changes everything if you're

going there and you want us to come with

you then absolutely let me go get more

weapons she gets all her weapons gets

things that aren't really weapons but

could be all the weapons yeah and orc it

takes a lot to to admit that you know

when push comes to shove you need the

help of the people and we are more than

happy to help you and I think it's that

vulnerability in that honesty that's

gonna make you hold on don't don't hold

it together that's gonna make you a

great Hokage I knew it was don't know

what Hokage I thought was very kind

thing to say how would you like to get

there that's what we would love to right

now everyone I have I don't have a plan

for this you know they have it

they wanted us to get it for them and we

kind of kind of blew that one I don't

know maybe there's something I mean

they're already rich so maybe there's

something else that that we can do to

get some you know to get some help like

they don't necessarily need money maybe

maybe like Asmodeus can just take like a

finger or something I don't need this

finger or this finger

whoa let's what if what if they're done

using it and maybe we can preserve it we

could just ask real nice yeah as you

recall the stone of goal or has the

information contained within it it can

impart that to whoever it tunes to it

you were told that at the auction so if

the castle enters get the information

out of it the stone becomes less useful

yeah I all I need is just a small amount

of time just to get the information and

then after that anyone can have the

stone but the longer we have it the less

people will have the information will if

we give it up less need to act that much

faster to even get to it right what

castle enters probably won't share is

the money because they need that to buy

the souls of their children back yeah

well that's fun I mean we're gonna get

$50,000 as soon as this suit with that

game cos settled golden yeah that's what

I said I said go no the line blurs all

right

so you're gonna head to Castle enter

villa for you that's across town

basically do west of where you are you

can follow Dells Orange Street all the

way to Castle enter villa great all

right but do you want to travel there by

coach or just walk in there or some of

you fly in some of you walk in what's

the deal

it's a beautiful if warm and somewhat

humid summer day and we'll get more so

as the day wears on that sounds nice

yeah let's all walk together and chat

cuz des wants us to keep him company

maybe while we go we can talk about

how we can go about doing this we can't

just broke bustin their swing in axes

and trying to take a stone the last time

Strix and evylyn checked out the estate

it was heavily guarded by castle enter

guards house guards wearing the livery

of the house and members of the city

watch it's probably totally fine we can

probably just go in cordially and use

our best manners and explain to them why

DF needs to use the stone for a minute

and maybe we can like babysit their

chained child for a little while give

them a break you know Simon can say hi

to some of his friends there made such

good friends

Moulton told me told me he made great

friends there did I did I tell you that

I remember I don't think I don't think I

did probably not nope no I don't think

you did so that knowledge is not known I

think it's safe is that Simon not go

with this I mean every time Simon tries

it gold with us you know it always ends

up being complications well of course of

course my son tries to join a court cult

mother all defying priests and

everything all over the place it's a

terrible example

he was just muttering to herself and

wandering up Simon was held palton that

he told even than than that he joined

the cult ok Paul I'm just like leans in

just like hey above game how do you know

that me cuz Strix just said it

okay that works out then okay your your

meta knowledge radar is going off on the

way to the camp the cows lanterns can we

have a nice time

yeah can we have a nice time like a spy

I passed by the high road there's

usually lots of merchants they're not

they have any money to buy anything but

you can always look and as you move into

the C ward you start to see people

become very well-dressed much more so

than the rest of the city so fashion is

always something you can look out for in

this part of the city you see the latest

fashions what the women in the men are

wearing out on the street the sights

there are lots of flowers and flower

boxes around so it's really beautiful

this time here is his paintings rep here

like enough to just like walk through

the streets and just like high-five

people be like hey how's it going just

enjoying a nice day out you know just

not it right nuts it is likely that

based on his reputation that he might

get stopped a few times recognized

people water davian's tend to be not too

showy and they don't go they don't go

crazy at the drop of a hat so it's more

like you might get tips of the hats or

women suddenly Fanning them Fanning

themselves with their hands or whatnot

as you go by okay good yeah okay good

people are noticing me collect flowers

on the way you start putting them in her

hair just slipping them out of people's

flower boxes and Adam in her hair okay

yeah you you notice it oh go ahead oh

sure that'd be real nice and you notice

that evens like reaction to this

normally would be like you but it's

like noticeably more subdued and like

yes that's very nice thank you all okay

well that's going on Trixie you're sort

of attracting

swarms of pigeons that's gonna follow

you around everywhere just like you know

you know the the singing song at the

beginning of Sleeping Beauty or

Cinderella where the song attached to

all the birds mister try and cheer

evylyn up and it's not working and

shootin and she notices it's not working

and she just gets so defeated and I just

like well just walks with her head down

why do you want to write down the

flowers will fall out

no even collects them and tries to put

them back what's wrong with you I'm

perfectly cheery no no March next month

when you get to the castle enter Villa

at the corner of Dell Zorn and Diamond

Street you see that it is a white walled

structure very kind of pristine looking

but like many of the other estates

around it clearly quite old because it

is a walled compound getting in is

normally through a front gate which is

closed at the moment however it is not

guarded and you can see the building is

beyond the wall there are two main

buildings one is what appears to be a

guest house on one corner and then the

main manor there is also a carriage

house having been here once before you

know that once you go through the gate

it's it's a walk through a garden

essentially to get to the main entrance

of the manor and there's like butterfly

gardens and a greenhouse and other

things right on the estate

well I think someone who can can speak

real nice and have good etiquette should

probably lead on it okay when you

approach the gate paltin you can see

that there are would appear to be

members of the city watch on the inside

the gate on the grounds and one of them

comes over to the gate and stares at you

through the bars the gilded bars good

afternoon

afternoon the use do you sir or madam or

whatever it is that you identify as how

are you

even's already face palming so hard this

is guard a woman in her 30s says move

along dear sir this is a private

residence and no guests are expected we

are in need of a somewhat

spur-of-the-moment consultation with

like Leanback I'm just like North the

castle lanterns right yeah with the

castle lanterns we are both I don't know

if you know me but word has gone around

no SEPA and SEPA attorney-at-law

i am said attorney when you mentioned

that you're an attorney

she hurt her the spark in her eyes this

sort of goes out and she just sort of

looks at you dully should have gone with

the musician water deeps very own paltin

SEPA entertainer performer single she

sort of her head a little bit and

says a singing attorney mm-hmm yes

that's right alton SEPA the singing

attorney she looks

the wine flask in your hand looks at you

and says and then she says I don't have

time for this please just leave please

this is it's very important it's a

matter of are the rest of you like

standing behind him like within view

through the gate probably for at least

this point DF is probably starting to

approach seeing how poorly it's going

I'm just kinda leans in it's like it's a

matter of the child and she frowns a

little bit at that point and looks over

her shoulder the other guards and says

wait here and you see her walk back

among the trees DF as you move up and

you look through the gate you can see

captain Alice Kell Adana on the grounds

that this guard is talking to you right

now oh and some other guards as well

Alice oh shoot

what's she doing here your colleague she

seems to be they're all since they're

all in uniform she would be here on

official business yeah that raises any

suspicion oh it's just if I could get an

opportunity to speak to my colleague

that that wouldn't help as you as your

as her eyes are drawn toward the gates

it's at that time you and her connect I

- eyes when she sees you she gestures

for a couple guards to follow then walks

over to the gate and opens them up in

front of you and she says um mr. Woodrow

pleasure to see you here is this

Schenley beer captain Woodrow are you

here on business

you tell it captain captain

I am yeah I'm here on on business yes

but what's what are you doing here

what's going on here she looks at her

other guards and sends them over to keep

an eye on the house so that she is now

alone with the four of you and she says

several of the castle enter guards were

driven off the residence there is some

something has happened inside the estate

no one is quite sure but the windows are

painted with blood well I'm sure we can

help with that

the inside the windows blood on the

inside that's correct

splattered everywhere there were screams

inside the house a great deal of loud

noises

apparently were reported and the guards

who fled did they said that in some

places on the grounds chains erupted and

tried to drag them down chains although

we haven't seen anything like that since

we've arrived I can't ask I'm sorry what

oh nothing please continue fix know what

I mean aren't all kids at that age just

change Devils I mean are you saying

there's a devil locked in here no no

absolutely please excuse my dear aunt

what she she her mind is in four places

at once

she is quite a plainer traveler mm-hmm

absolutely well my orders are to stand

guard at the estate until we find

someone who can enter the premises

legally oh we totally can we're invited

guests make a decision it's not

deception even thinks they were invited

no this deception

okay hold on even if yourself delude

yourself into thinking it's still

deception would be deception at

advantage if you actually believe it is

14 okay and she says I can't believe you

of all people would lie to me a captain

of the guard I thought I thought that we

were invited you made that up in my head

I'm sorry I don't know I don't know who

I am lately so to the back well look if

we need to have permission to enter the

premises you know as captain of the

watch this is something that I do wish

to investigate and I require the

assistance of my associates that's us

she says well I I can't give you

permission to enter well who can I don't

I'd like to speak to them well then

who's in charge here she says I'm in

charge of this detachment of guards

until I'm relieved by captain Carter oka

now you recognize that name because you

met captain Carter oka at the castle at

her estate when the castle enters were

bragging that they had bought him she

says until then until I get orders from

a commander of the watch or a someone of

the castle and her family we will remain

out here and make sure nobody gets

inside got carrucha cackle rook was in

charge of this investigation right now

well there's there hasn't been an

investigation

nobody's initiated one but Carter oka

operates out of a watch post here in

this part of C ward and this is part of

his beat do you feel like kind of get as

close as you can to Alice and just

she'll lower his voice yeah it's kind of

lowers voice Blake how much have you

spoken to Carr carrucha and what's your

relationship with him like we're both

the same rank other than that we have

virtually no contact

Carr carrucha is bought by the castle

enters they've said so themselves

and if he's not letting anyone in he's

covering up something here I see well

then I see of course

but to let you inside now we can make it

quick

we're not at the mercy of the corrupt

that's right house I just want to do the

right thing and everyone I have with

you're with me are strangely experts in

this field of stuff all right go do the

right thing

Thank You Alice I won't forget this

inhale did you like a real awkward just

like shoulder cap looks at your hat on

our shoulder really just it's okay if

you need us we'll be outside certainly

stay on alert if you hear any kind of

signal we might might need your

assistance when anyone walks by she's

just like all right when you go to the

house you find that the the front door

is not locked okay stop us from entering

it and say there is a devil in here we

are going to have to fight it please let

us get ready

somehow anything to prepare it so the

even can you like bless us or something

with non anti deadly and stop um yeah

how about I just turn on my super

healing powers sure protection from evil

eye oh you want that instead I can

that either or I I can also do

protection for me whole people do you

sense any kind of Devils nearby is it

still within the premises can I do my

divine sense reach out with my lysander

senses yes and when you do you sense a

powerful singular evil fiend does it

feel the same as that chain demon yes

and it's coming from the house that

looms before you it's in there just one

same one on one of the upper floors it

seems last time you saw it was in the

Attic so that's not unexpected all right

so it's definitely gonna be in there if

this thing is causing it then we need to

stop it and take it down just well

likely angular2 Castle enters but at

this point we're not trying to win

favors with them maybe stopping this but

via favor to them what what what did we

tell the guards we're doing in here do

you say we're gonna go in and say devil

pretty much okay I mean how many do you

have how many slots not everybody I

rested so we have three slots I might

want to save at least one of them for us

and polymorph

so so death whenever anyone yeah

everyone death where'd everyone go so

take one all right there's three slots

boom boo-boom all right so she will give

death ward to everyone besides her so if

anyone wants me to perform a dedication

ceremony tilith and ER i could do that

for them if you wanted to be devoted to

a service which means you can roll a d4

and add the number roll to any safe I

for the next 24 hours everyone anybody

want a d-10 for the next 10 minutes

[Laughter]

give it to evil energy it was just

pouting no one wants to laugh and err

ceremony I'll take a look thinner

ceremony I'll give you a little song in

exchange well is it you you have to

really mean it this is something you can

only do once you said earlier that you

wanted you know you believed in the

theatre and you wanted more Lysander in

the world and you believed and you know

that the world needed more of this God

stuff so if you really mean it I could

dedicate you to a service right now you

know what I I think I'll give it a few

more services until I until I commit to

such a ceremony

it sounds enticing and I definitely want

to learn more about it it sounds like a

lot to do right before running into it I

mean it could be the right time to do it

right before running into a devil I'm

just saying but I understand you know no

pressure

how long has said ceremony well I mean

it's kind of up to do you how long I

mean like what what do you want your

moment of dedication till evander to be

like you know what let's just uh just

make let's just make like a kid and put

a pin in that

that's a horrible joke casting all these

spells and stuff on each other like

having up down just kind of goes does

anyone want a dagger you might be able

to hit with it those daggers won't work

against the devil so let's just go in

okay yeah and I granted a Bartok

inspiration to be one d-10 what song do

you play here I improved some some kind

of laughs and everything but it's

totally just like zero knowledge like

love Xander is really dope

Lord of Light it's bright like the Sun

look Bandar is pretty sick it's like

[Laughter]

alright the new hip song with Anders

pretty dope the metal cover we'll be on

tour

exactly death will place a hand on to

the the doorknob and put a shoulder to

and turn back to everyone else dislike

remember can you take care of this but

we're also looking for the stone of

galore let's see if we can get both they

with that he'll like push his way in

very triumphantly ok make a strength

check because there's some pushing

against the door oh let's find out

I like 19 okay yeah you open the door so

the the entrance to this place has this

sort of beautiful gilded devil like

knocker to it very fearsome gargoyle ish

image staring at you as your shoulder at

the door open as you push the door open

you see the foyer beyond has curtain'd

windows and you see blood splattered

everywhere and tears in the walls as if

something in the walls kind of tore out

and ripped out a bunch of the plaster

and the plaster just sort of lies i'll

fallen away on the floor almost like if

you had grabbed like a handful of wiring

and just ran with it and the wiring just

rode tour tour ribbons up through the

walls what was holding the door shut is

a corpse a guard or rather the top half

of a guard who's been sheared in path

you see his legs the lower part of him

torn away in another part of the room

almost looks like he was just sort of

ripped in half and you can also see that

deeper in the dark recesses of this

foyer which has two other exits off of

it there's something hanging from the

ceiling and that's not a chandelier it

appears to be a body hanging from a pair

of chains that have dropped through the

ceiling and the body is that of a

tiefling does it look similar to the

nanny with your dark vision Strix and

you peer inside your eyes quickly adjust

and you see that it is the tall tiefling

man servant to Lord Victoria Castle

enter and he's just swinging there on

the in these two chains and those spikes

the spikes of the chains are impaling

his body and basically holding him in

place defences here this is really bad

Strix these chained Devils what are we

dealing with okay but you've actually

made this check before and done better

so the last time you might the devil

this was mainly to see if you learned

anything else so what you know about

them is based on your studies of

infernal creatures Holly that chained

Devils which are some of the most

humanoid looking ones although their

bodies are completely wrapped in Chains

they can animate chains around them and

nearby their sadistic beyond belief

their torturers in the infernal realms

relishing pain and thriving on

inflicting it on others they are called

on to torment mortal souls and unleash

their sadistic fury upon lesser devils

as well their abilities are akin to that

of most Devils which is to say they're

resistant to cold they're resistant to

non magical weapons unless they're

silvered

and they're immune to fire and poison

they also have dark vision and they

speak infernal and who knows what else

like many devils they probably have

telepathy as well but terror is their

deck and we remembered that this was one

of the castle enter children that was

turned into this their their adult child

they're they're essentially tea no we

were stoned child you were taken

upstairs and he was lashed by his own

chains in the Attic with magical sickles

around him procedurals around him

preventing him from escaping the best

thing we may think that we can do is try

and get it to come to us while we're in

some kind of protective please do you

think there's anything we can do to

change him back into a child cuz I can

remove curses okay what's your question

name my question is can we leave I'm

trying to figure out the part where we

go and we fight this thing

is a good idea well I have to fight this

thing it's you know evil incarnate

right true but you didn't then I would

lose any last vestiges of my paladin

hood and be very confused about my

identity but what if preparing better to

fight this thing why you leave so that

we know where it is

we might be able to get out faster and

we might be able to get out faster by

getting the stone and then just leaving

and having the guards help us take down

the devil did I have enough way ah I see

with your royal stress you were able to

determine that a chain devil like like

all Devils are damned creatures they

they're paying or suffering for some

evil inflicted by themselves or others

it's not it's not so easily undone as by

a remove curse spell or anything like

that yeah this is big magic that doesn't

have an undo sorry that's okay I

understand that means we have to send

his soul to Lysander to be fixed I know

it's not going to levander but it it'll

go somewhere and it'll get fixed that

you're not certain about because you

believe based on what the council Anders

told you this chain devil was created a

little bit differently than normal

oh yeah it was basically a the soul

given to the nine hells as part of a

deal not a not an evil person who

descended to the nine hells became a

devil right so it you're not exactly

sure what will become of its soul if

this form of it is destroyed well if

anything it's all we'll be in a better

place than stuck in this devil

absolutely which is why we need to free

him all right so what the stone is in

the stones an object not a creature

right in its current form you believe

it's an object yeah I can't do anything

okay well I could rotate object I think

let me double check I sure can hold on

hmm I guess locate object and you're

searching for the stone of go Laura and

the range isn't a thousand feet correct

mm-hmm you are not picking it up it's

not here maybe it's just hidden and like

a bag of holding or something if that

were the case you would not sense it it

could just be hid

look not let's not assume otherwise well

I feel like this stopped becoming about

the stone and became about this devil

thing is demon sometimes that happens

sometimes you're just going about your

day and demon happens then you got to

deal with it

yeah hmm even if you don't want to

Street who turned out to be a double

look I have a really nice job with

flexible hours but sometimes that means

being on-call and this is one of those

times okay if we can figure out a way to

get it to come to us then well let me

finish let me finish my sentence before

you start screaming at a demon okay so

if we can get it to come to us we could

chill in the hut I feel like we'd be

relatively protected that's not good

well hiding in a hut doesn't stop a

tunnel right at the point in time Oh yep

here we go

paltin what's your armor class hmm oh no

that depends on the role

[Laughter]

14 mm 15 50 okay

a chain bursts out of the ceiling and

attacks you oh look we just need to

figure out if we can hunt then you take

11 points of slashing damage as it wraps

around you pulls you up into the ceiling

No all right you just sort of hit crash

up into the ceiling the chain grabs me

and paltin just looks out he goes I'm

going to go now yeah so he gets he gets

yanked off his feet and ripped up into

the ceiling of this vaulted foyer evil

evil evil and follows immediately no all

right let's roll initiative we talk too

long I think we've talked to the

appropriate amount Strix what's your

initiative I got 18 DF 17 evylyn 15

palton Glenny 1 anyone palton what do

you do as you are torn up into the

ceiling and you're being pulled between

floors

so between the ceiling of the room

you've just got yanked up into and the

floor of the level above dragged among

you know support posts and pipes and

other things have I stopped you have not

you continue to be pulled away from your

friends through the innards of the house

and actually I you take some more damage

at the start of your turn you take

another 8 points of damage

Oh fun as you are smashed and buffeted

against the insides of the house ok or

my like arms tonight your you can still

use weapons and manipulate your arms or

cast spells or stuff like that but you

are grappled effective

okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like

thunder wave where I am I'm just like Oh

panic explosion alright sort of toward

where you're being pulled or just okay

I'm being pulled I love that you're like

all right up there looks good go ahead

and roll damage okey-dokey I'm doing

that still okay

doo doo doo doo doo de doo okay so

so before the rest of you can react and

you hear paltin being dragged through

the house then there's suddenly this

thunderous explosion 28 okay that's

enough to shatter the chain that's

grabbing you and also shatter the the

area around you and you plunge back out

of the ceiling down into the foyer about

15 feet away from where you were and

land on the ground taking two points of

damage so I like clear everything

there's like that moment where I'm just

kind of floating midair it's like ya did

it right and then all of this there's

this huge rain of plaster and wood and

other debris down around you and the

rest of you see this he just got pulled

up through the roof dragged about ten

feet through the ceiling and then fell

back down after this thunderous

explosion blasted a hole in everything

petition to rename us the demolition

crew it's up there I did my part and the

rest of you can hear what sounds like

chains rattling between walls but it is

no strict cistern strix there doesn't

appear to be anything to attack at this

point although there's a big gaping to

big gaping holes in the roof was taken

right yeah he was taken up into the

house alright so I will use my action to

turn my group my staff room okay and oh

okay now as you would expect there's not

a ton of space between the ceiling on

the level you are and the floor above

you it's like a crawl space as you as

you fly up there you can sort of stick

your head up in you're like oh my god

Paul just got pulled through about 10

feet of

that okay so he got pulled through the

crawl space yeah and so as you peer up

and you look into the darkness of the

crawl space you see actually something

pretty unnerving it's like a nest of

chains rattling around in the crawl

space

I just I just yell it's gross up here

yep I know that's part of the devil so

I'm going to cast my spirit Guardians at

fifth level up here um just around me

okay because like they can fly anyway

like fly like chicken so okay

yeah so these these flapping spectral

chickens surround you in sort of a 15

foot radius and they do radiant damage

oh no I'm trying to just like how does

many radiant things around me as I can

okay so let's see if you turn your thing

into a broom you flew up and you cast

the spell so you're probably about done

yeah

DF what do you do I tell them it's gross

up here uh that's a great question

and you know there are two doors leading

off of this hall one one to the left and

one sorry one yeah I went to the left

and one at the end of the hall before I

before I do anything else with these

walls that were kinda like scratched up

and all that did it look like they were

just like attacks against the wall or

you look like something was like trying

to like search through the wall or it

looks like because all the damage has

fallen outward that's something burst

out of the wall okay

like whatever something was inside

between the walls of between rooms

essentially and burst out these are

walls going to other rooms at walls like

the outside that's correct

there's no carrier walls okay I kind of

want to dart over there and check that

out real quick okay you go to one of the

tears and as you do and you listen you

can hear through the through the

structure of the house the sound of

chains rattling inside the walls oh my

gosh like going through the whole damn

place it seems that way uh-oh mmm just

like the house is alive with the demon

just any any point in time a chain can

burst out you as you just saw yeah okay

okay um I guess other thing I want to do

is run I guess I'll use my cunning

action to - and then make my way over to

the the tiefling that was hanging yeah

you you don't remember his name but he

was the valet to Lord Castle enter yeah

Strix was saying that their torturous

demons so I want to make sure this guy's

actually dead not just being tortured

okay you can see that I'll make a

medicine check

he's about he suspended about nine feet

off the floor okay 18 he's still alive

but obviously in a tremendously bad

shape right and hung up by chains yeah

and the spike chains are piercing his

body all over the place so he's bright

he's bleeding out slowly so I'm kinda

like okay justjust just hang in there

we'll help you in a second uh yeah

that's pretty much my turn I don't know

what else to do

you haven't technically use I guess

making your check was an action so okay

yeah I've got an action you're anything

like that that I'm just like I don't

know what else I could really do evylyn

as you are standing in this hallway

moving forward closer to where palton

fell you sense that the devil is above

you one at least you'd guess one level

above you and that's it's not more than

thirty feet like could I get to it

flying well there's no direct way

straight up because the roof mm-hmm but

if there were no impediment yeah you

could get there in 30 feet well she she

you see her take light fall and like

hold it the way she does when she's

gonna use it as a Sun beam bazooka

aiming right at it but as soon as she

hears DFB like you're still alive hold

on she's like okay and then she goes and

flies up and lays on hands

well actually the action would be to

take him down I guess oh so you want to

try to free him from his spiked chains

yeah okay in that case Oh

it's not just raw strength because that

would just inflict more pain on him

I guess it's dexterity right yeah let's

let's say it's a dexterity check to

basically free him from these tangled

chains okay

like deaath we'll be there to catch them

if you bots will say it's a dexterity

medicine check so if you have the

medicine skill you can add your

proficiency bonus to your dexterity

check don't have a medicine skill cuz

you don't need medicine when you have

the light of lysander okay yeah that's

how people die axon eight your kids yeah

I only got an 11 on the Dex check okay

you are not able to untangle him and

actually when you try you see that the

chains are actually resisting you and

tightening around him not cool like

they're alive hello Oh can't I I have

Bartek inspiration right can I add that

to that that's a check so yeah soon I'm

gonna add my d-10 when I feel them start

to resist

I remember the beautiful song Paulson

saying me and I add five total of

sixteen you are successful thanks grace

and you free you free this tea fling and

bring him out of the chains on to the

floor Dylan tries to approximate the

song as she fought like carries him to

the ground like levander sewed up he's

sick and he's really cool she's just

making up her own words nice I wrote

that song yeah you said you were gonna

say something sure ODF is gonna dip

either to catch up when she releases him

okay

you'll put him in India's arms okay all

right and he's of course still in really

bad shape but no longer being tortured

by the chains

next is paltin actually before palton

the devil the chains that are have no

longer have the tiefling wrapped in them

start to kind of

about and one of them detaches from the

ceiling to swing down and grab UDF this

is against your dexterity that'll be a

26 to hit so I'm guessing yeah so DF you

know disarmer class is on the class okay

so it hits you for a total of 12

slashing damage you are grappled by the

chain and then it pulls you up into the

ceiling

I want to uncanny dodge the initial teka

at least that's I don't like leaping

away like so grab around me yeah okay so

you take half the damage so six points

you are grappled and pulled up into the

crawl space of the ceiling the other

chain is going to attempt to snare

evylyn Azzam as I'm being pulled up I'm

just gonna quick be like don't worry

about me okay Oh

evylyn does that 18 hit you II oh I'm

too handing my axe right now which gives

me plus 2 2 AC so I have 18 exactly okay

so it does get you dad so I always

forget which the rule is like it goes

rocks around you you take eight points

of slashing damage from its barbs and

sharp edges and it coils around you

grapples you and pulls you up into the

crawlspace as well both anders.dahl so

now palton on your turn you're just sort

of lying there pro and amidst this

plaster and you're you and Strix are now

alone in the foyer with this dying

tiefling so not everyone just DF and

evylyn okay and Paul thing is returning

so uh we're we're we're still sticking

to this we're on the street so we have

to deal with it

okay I'm going to I think you should

spend more time trying to make her happy

I'm gonna try and grab like a good like

feel on where it is like if I tried to

say vanish it no you don't you can't do

that right now you don't see it and

there isn't a good way up there for me

one who cannot fly well having been in

the house before you know that if you go

through the door at the end of the foyer

that will take you to the central

chamber that has a sweeping staircase

that goes upstairs so you're one room

away from a staircase leading up so I

just look up and I call out to the demon

I'm just like on my own terms I'm going

to take the stairs and I make I will

make my way toward the stairs okay you

stand up you walk over dusters just the

plaster off yourself open up the door

leading into the central chamber in this

foyer you can see it has a marble floor

it's very elegant and the sweeping

staircase goes upstairs you can see that

there are mutilated corpses everywhere

at least half a dozen guards have been

rented to pieces flayed by chains as it

were you can see tears in the walls

through which the chains erupted you can

see drag marks across the floor and

places where the chains must have picked

them up and smashed them against the

marble floor and against the staircase

and against pretty much every other

surface in this room so there's

everything everything is just dripping

with blood and gore and broken weaponry

or just you can also see halfway up the

staircase a face down figure that also

looks as dead as the guards and it

appears to be the kids tiefling nanny

well Peaks and just gives up huh

then but more disturbing than that also

the sound of music coming from the level

above you hear a harpsichord being

played

somber Tunes minor-key why is it always

a minor key

so paltin is going to reshoot that door

and not enter it okay good boy that that

way is taken so because I've been here

mm-hmm could I visualize the room that I

suspect they're in if you think it's the

room above you know where the music

seems to be coming from yes because you

did walk through that room at one point

it is the conservatory and ballroom okay

now a follow-up question for a dimension

door is it like is it like a portal

situation where I can open it up and

like look through or is it like a big

just you know doorway of glowing light

that's just like jump through and good

luck on the other side it's not a it's

not a scrying device

it's just like a rectangular doorway of

light that you step through that ends

that deposits you wherever you intend

okay so so it's a door but not a window

okay oh and a fan door opens a window or

something okay so your goal is basically

a dimension door to the floor above the

room above okay you see the dimension

door appear Strix near paulten turns it

Paulson turns this tricks and again I'm

going to go now

and then he steps through the plane and

disappears before your eyes in its

snapshot behind him so Strix you are now

alone with the dying tiefling paltin you

even hear the chains and the walls all

around you but it's it it's a faint

sound compared to the music being played

by the harpsichord and this room that

you have dimension door din too as I

said it's a very large conservatory an

elegant or once elegant ballroom marble

floor with the dazzling mosaic and in an

alcove in one end of the room is the

harpsichord facing a window looking out

onto a balcony you can see the mosaic of

a silver chalice with the image of a

Golden Sun worked into the design of the

window which is otherwise spray-painted

with blood as many of the other windows

here and the tapestries and curtains are

likewise covered in blood you also see

chains hanging down from the ceiling

where they've cracked come through

cracks seated at the harpsichord is a

creature that looks like a man-sized

being wrapped head-to-toe in chains and

it is playing the harpsichord with its

back to you and all the chains draping

off it are sort of writhing and moving

around it and some of them are actually

gone into the walls and floor so it's

sort of anchored at the harpsichord and

just playing it with all the passion

that it can muster dancing around you in

the room is a ballroom mannequin well a

black mannequin clad in a black gown

faceless and it's just sort of pure

wedding and dancing in a circle around

you and looks like it must have been

doing that before you showed up you just

happen to appear in the middle of it

cool and while this creature is playing

this music you can hear evil and India

rattling around or being dragged through

the crawl spaces of the house under your

feet

when to hide and the devil says to you I

suppose although he doesn't turn to face

you just opt thresholds are blocked

do you speak infernal perchance I don't

okay

then you have no idea what he just said

I just kind of reply like perhaps in a

common or elvish the the mannequin

sort of spins around in front of you bow

before you and tries to extends its arms

as if to sweep you up in dance just like

yeah why the hell not okay all right you

actually have a choice you want to lead

or do you want to follow I will follow

okay see this mannequin has in mind all

right that's your turn

strix you're downstairs in the foyer all

right two of your friends have been

pulled up into the crawl space in the

ceiling and you hear them being dragged

away from you well this this peopling

below me that's right here I'm going to

just I'm gonna heal them okay I see

kneel down next to this hall male

tiefling he's an older tiefling and

you've met him a few times he was a

little bit of an ass to you the first

time you met him but and he was he was

with Lord Victoria Castle enter at the

auction so you've seen him a couple of

times

how much healing do you want to give him

six points but it's just to stabilize

them and wake him up for less all right

he clutches at you as soon as he gets

the strength to lift his arms and sort

of pulls you down close and he with his

yellow fangs and his bloody breath says

to you us fall to us escaped freed by

the father of evil was he here the

father of evil was he here you see him

nod wide-eyed in terror all of you house

it's worse all right yeah don't you

don't need to be here like save yourself

and stop worshiping even gods for the

for the love of the Gods uh he says

it was the lady of the house she should

not have hurt you and then he starts to

crawl across the floor and try to get to

his feet I just yell do you know where

the stone is he shakes his head so are

they here on the castle enters here are

they dead

he he looks at you a fear looks up back

at the house and says I don't know well

go out tell the guards that that you're

injured and that we yield ooh yes yes

and he stumbles away okay you take some

damage - yes at the start of your turn

seven points as the as you are as these

chains tighten and constrict you know

not down here okay

they uh they like still pulling me yeah

we're being dragged through the innards

of the house essentially you come to a

corner and then they start to pull you

up between walls all right so I'm

basically to let them continue to pull

me okay all right

evylyn what do you do

so you take you take some damage as well

I'm sorry you take ten points of damage

from the constricting raking chains okay

so I'm just being like pulled through

this crawl space and I still don't have

any idea like where the actual yeah you

don't know where the where the fiend is

although if this thing is controlling

chains all through the house it's

possible it might be bringing you to it

and I still have my divine sense right

did when I had the divine sense was it

just like the whole house or do I have

it or no you're able to be it in on it

with your divine sense and you can see

as you're being pulled through the crawl

spaces of the house that you're kind of

moving around it now as you start to get

pulled up into the house a little bit

and it almost feels like if this were to

continued almost sort of circle it but

you are getting closer to it and

obviously you know TF is being dragged

with you he's a little bit ahead of you

she yeah since she knows that deaath is

in the chains as well and that she

doesn't know the location of the rest of

the party again she has her axe almost

in bazooka mode but then it passes and

she lets it go she doesn't do it because

she doesn't want to accidentally fry

somebody sure um because she doesn't

have careful spell and so she'll hold

action until she is in range of the

demon itself okay yeah essentially she

can she can act once once the demon or

Devil reveals itself yeah so I'm just

gonna hold hold action on a melee attack

basically okay

all right then that takes us the bomb

initiative so we're back at the top with

the demon the palton you are following

this creature this this mannequin as it

leads you and does a dance you're not

sure what song the devil is playing at

the harpsichord

but this animated construct that you're

dancing with this faceless thing where

you can see your own reflection in its

black shiny marble like opal faceless

head illustrative and you feel like it

is it is like the best dancer you've

ever had the privilege of dancing with

it so it's must be some sort of dancing

instructor mannequin or something it it

guides you very well around the room and

you feel strangely safe in its care the

devil continues to talk in infernal but

you don't know what he's saying or if

he's addressing you directly but the way

he's just pounding on this instrument

suggests there's a lot of rage that he's

pouring out through his music okay and

it's your turn I'm going to this thing

by the way you get the sense that the

way this mannequin is guiding you it's

trying to keep you away from the devil

hmm but it's leading currently so gosh

yeah well I will continue to be led okay

and I will

can i if I may I want to like gesture to

the mannequin to like hold for a second

it will we'll do that okay can i let's

see what do I have that's gone I guess

I'll take out my bagpipes and try to

play along if I may to see if that does

anything okay you pull out your bagpipes

make a performance check that I very

much and the rest of you in the house

can hear the bagpipes I mean those

things can be saved for hundreds of feet

so so even though you can't hear the the

more delicate harpsichord music while

being dragged and buffeted around the

interior of the house and on the lower

levels the bet the bagpipes sound out

loudly that is a 23 okay and you're

trying to just essentially accompany the

music that's being played mm-hmm okay in

that case the something about the nature

of the devil changes you see it's its

shoulders sag a little bit more and you

actually think it might be weaving and

then Strix what do you do I'm okay you

you think your best bet is to go through

the door that paltin open then closed

okay all right I do that when you open

it you see and smell the carnage in the

main hall with the staircase leading up

and as you make your way up the stairs

you kind of have to sidestep all these

body parts okay but the music does get

louder and you're actually able to reach

the top of the stairs which lead right

into the conservatory and that's when

you see paltin this black gown manikin

standing before him not moving and off

on one end of the darkened conservatory

under a beam of

sunlight is a chain devil playing a

harpsichord with its back to you I'm

going to try and talk well first I see

paltin and this mannequin this is a lot

there's a lot happening here

I'm very of the body that's all very

overwhelming I see streets walking yeah

you would see her coming up the stairs

and walk into the conservatory edgewise

say something to her real quick before

she doesn't even you have to stop

playing or you just have to sort of

carry a note while you do yeah cuz it

the bagpipe I can keep the so just like

in between like melody breaths just like

I think it's sad it seems like this is

doing something the manic I think is

chill uh what do tricks is like and

that's a very pulsing explanation but I

think it's they spend enough time

together where she understands she's

gained and in infernal say are you okay

[Music]

can you let my friends go uh it says to

you in infernal I have no wish to argue

well don't hurt my friends either please

and

it says why are you here well we we came

here I'm also your music is very very

nice thank you for playing pretty

talented

we very compliment at this point D F and

Evelyn you come crashing through walls

as chains basically rent openings in the

walls and just sort of cast you into

them if that's the case and I'm now in

ranged then even would be attacking

without question she'd be like axe ready

and as soon as the chain pulled her in

like would also like to do uh like him

between breasts like wait wait hold up

we're doing a thing

so even is like flying in like uh holy

rages and they're both like she stops

like good this close to it and she's

like chain devil doesn't even turn to

face you evil and you're attacking it

from behind what do I remember the name

of this kid

his name is aza bald oh okay I was bald

oh I'm gonna say his name Whately I'm

gonna say Osvaldo uh what what happened

here he says I was set free

well technically you're not free because

you're still in the body of a devil and

thus I will always remain thanks to my

parents not necessarily like we can free

you I mean whatever happens with you

can't I belong to he that is the master

of darkness he lies all the time I turn

CO and Ella Serena we are all three of

us damned

oh we're are transient

and and Audrina he plays a heavy note

and he says they're mine sure they're

fine they're mine I would have rather

heard they're fine they have a date with

the nine hells alright um so is there

any way that we could get you to maybe

not be evil cuz my talented friend here

is just gonna go ham on you in a moment

moment's notice you don't big acts and I

honestly I don't think this is your

fault I think it's your parents fault

they know a lot of us had bad parents

and honestly we have to realize that

their teens are humans too and that they

are not flawless and now sometimes we're

very damaged when we become adults so I

think I'll end us in therapy so I think

if you want to help Terenzi oh and I'll

Serena you'll have to go through me Oh

is there anything that we can offer you

instead of an untimely death Devils love

bargains right he says you can save my

brother and sister from the damnation

that has been cast upon me promise that

and I'll let them go otherwise they will

stay until the nine hells claims them

see unfortunately that means that you're

still here though and I don't think my

paladin friend is going to be happy if a

devil is still lucid Waterdeep I look at

20 you I'm just like I look back at the

party and I'm like I don't know choppy

choppy

you didn't come here to save them why

are you here oh no no that was taken by

thieves do you know what the thieves

look like yes

one of them was a woman in a black mask

the other a creature of shadow creature

shadow well I'm late to see I relayed

this to the party and say black Viper

took the stone again she's real good at

taking stuff but I will give you

something something my parents wanted to

keep from you Wow two holes tear in the

ceiling chains come out and just sort of

unspool and release the mangled corpses

of Lord and Lady Castle enter who hit

the marble floor with splashes and they

lie dead torn asunder by their son all

around you even still got her ax if

she's looking at the corpses looking at

Strix looking at the corpses looking at

Strix not really sure what y'all are

talking about but pretty sure that voids

a contract yes and before they died I

learned everything it was a long and

painful torture session the vault lies

under a tower in the C ward

not far from the house of the inspired

hands the tower is abandoned and has

been for years three keys are needed to

enter the vault an animated construct a

beholder I stock and a gift from a queen

I mean all women are clean so I look I

like I told a party this especially DF

because he's probably writing it down

what do you so you just call out DF and

say hey write this down he's already

like hey yeah the devil actually says

your name DF mall and then says shard of

divinity why he said shard of divinity

and he's right

strikes in ancient infernal das name

means shard of divinity or shard of the

god you just got chris perkins no it's

like you never never even wouldn't have

heard of you I mean can some can someone

insight that well she knows it's true

cuz she speaks infernal oh great get out

of here he says

if I could kill you I would but it is

forbidden for me to do so do you know

why not is because that's really weird

one who freed me forbade it he said you

are too important to him who freed you

there are guardians of his child who's

his child which child what just plays

another minor note in slave if I

know

no but that's important we need to know

who his child is who who exactly is the

guardians of his child all of us yes

well we have like five kids so we do I'm

sure it's waffles waffles child of

Asmodeus the twist and the devil can

sort of plays plays out the rest of the

tune and then stops and then turns at

you with glaring green eyes that seemed

to glow no no you finish I'm just you

know waiting for my part I don't know

what to do here I'm lost I don't use the

axe blade is really close to his chain

wrapped head Edelen he just sort of

stares at it and burns burns holes of

hatred through you you think that this

despite what he has told you he is still

a cruel and twisted fiend of evil and

that what he would like more than

anything is to tear you apart and would

that he could I know and it's not his

fault he just you know but I but by

letting him walk the path in

to a new dawn well as soon as Strix is

done talking to it apparently he's he's

there to make sure that the the two

younger Castle enters you know end up in

the nine hells just as he was cast down

that's what why why do you want your

siblings in the house I don't have a

choice the only way you can protect them

is to free them from me mmm yeah don't

worry I'll do that as soon as Strix is

done chatting with you I mean if we help

them that means we have to destroy you

that's real real self sacrificial I'm

sure that what the gods smile about

being The Shard of divinity which I

really don't ever want to say again but

I have to and or like the child or

anything or the thieves who came and

stole the stone weren't alone

the corpses of their companions i strewn

around the house they were the only ones

who escaped all right

well I'm sorry but this had to happen to

you and I hope you know that this isn't

your fault

this isn't anyone's fault except for

Lord and Lady Council answer for making

a deal with someone who is the Incarnate

of evil I've hated them since I was a

child well I'm hoping that we can bring

you some peace regardless of what

happens if you're afraid of this Devils

body you might be able to go someplace

better

so I'd seen that when she says that she

looks at evil and just gives her the

like the eyes of like cohort he gets mad

and he says there's no hope do not give

me hope even like Pat's him on the

shoulder and she's like she's like

herself there's there's always hope

sleep sweet

all right make an attack roll

with the axe ah that will be I'm just

double-checking to make sure I should

have had this up that will be a 23

that's it

Roy your damage and all your all your

fixings you know if your divine smite in

there whatever mm-hmm so that's a

seventeen plus four which would be 21

and then also to d6 radiant damage so

twenty to twenty five and then I have

the automatic divine smite which is

thirty two without even doing anything

else just just hitting with my axe is 32

are you happy with that I'll take my

second attack after that okay go ahead

because he's still alive after taking 32

that's an 18 that's a hit okay so that's

gonna be uh let's see

eleven plus so twenty twenty three

thirty yeah how's he looking after

thirty bloodied she doesn't she doesn't

want to like not finish him off smite

him can I add divine smite now sure okay

just do it okay I'm just gonna

double-check the how many there we go

okay so that adds one you probably act

on this yeah and then we'll make it a

third level spell so twelve

14:21 and he's a fiend right correct

yeah so that's another 22 so so 21 22

total to add to what I just did

okay so you did 62 then you did another

22 by the sounds of it yeah so that was

by adding divine smite to my second

attack so you did a total of 84 points

of damage with your two attacks to this

creature you just smash it smash it down

it literally collapses through the seat

it was sitting on and is now lying at

your feet

you can see that it is clinging to the

barest thread of life this is like even

finds this very distasteful because it's

like not even putting up a fight she's

like trying to put an animal out of its

misery like when you have a fish and

you're trying to like knock it out and

it won't get knocked out and you just

have to keep doing it and she's like you

can see her almost like gagging a little

bit should she can she take another

attack because it's like fighting back

it's other other characters what are you

guys doing as evil ins whacking on this

thing I mean it's almost dying

you have to have hope just try just oh

you don't have to be balanced at this

form just have a little bit of hope you

don't know what you're talking about

I do actually you are leave fool maybe

but I'd rather be a fool than bad you

have never been to the nine hells you

don't know what hopelessness is but you

will oh I think that I think that hopes

a lot stronger than you think it is and

can even beat the hell's but I'm you

know maybe I am my you but you see that

that's not that that just cannot

register with him at all it's like it's

a complete blind spot to this creature

it has no sense of any thing having to

do with hope or salvation it's just not

written into it

D F takes moon splinter and misty steps

out of the chains all right just just

just to get out of that they just sort

of collapse she's like why don't you

finish him off this is the seemed like

evil ins thing he called you names I

think they were mean names all right

even there doesn't seem to be anybody

stepping up to do your dirty work for

you

that's a 27 okay that it's and you said

he's just kind of clinging to life at

this point right yeah he's got one hit

point left

okay well then that'll do it Mikey Dubya

kendo is 85 hit points so you you drive

that axe down through its skull cracking

the chains you feel the house tremble

and then the house begins to fall apart

everybody big plaster start to break

away from the walls and ceiling you hear

in other rooms things come crashing down

all the change inside are coming apart

we have to go take someone with you if

they're nearby windows or anything there

are there are we goes out onto a balcony

perfect we can use that door absolutely

swinging doors you can go out onto a

balcony yeah so you go out onto the

balcony and you're looking down onto the

gardens you can see some guards out

there vigilant because they've heard

noises and things coming from the house

but you step out onto the balcony and

you can hear crashing sounds in the

house behind you it's falling apart we

have to go we have to get down do we

know what those kids look like oh yeah

they've actually been at the Waffle

House they went

for pastries in high school right okay

locate creature paulsen quick find the

children me now has paltin ever met them

question it was there I guess he was

there does he remember them that's

another question but he doesn't over a

lot of stuff it's true yeah

so let's see kids room kids room where

is that that is there snuck up in their

bedroom and c18 that is one level above

you on the other side of the house

palton it's only in terms of actual

distance there's only about 50 feet away

from you but it you have to run up the

stairs from the conservatory to get up

there

evylyn mother seems like no no no the

house was falling down I'll fly well

have I did I go up to there last time I

was here you went up all the way to the

Attic you did not actually enter the

area of the house where you can sense

that the twins are but you were close

you were very close probably passed

outside the room so yeah so yeah if I

could just like how many do I have

good lord okay if I could dimension door

up there lady at least close as I sure

him your hallway outside the door you

could do that okay yeah let's let's do

that take one of us with you yeah I'm

gonna do that

who me yeah yeah evil and fly it fly it

down we'll do that alright so you're

able to get up to the kids room barge in

the door and you can see as the room is

collapsing around them these two kids

the same age a boy and a girl huddled on

one of the beds together they look like

they've been crying for a long time I

grab them and hold them like don't worry

you can stay with us you just they're

not children help has arrived

alright so and there are windows leading

out of here that if you wanted to smash

one you could fly out with them can I

carry them both uh yeah you could

probably carry one yeah

can you can you dimension door out with

one of them yeah I've got one left so I

could take one out

okay I'll take one take one with so

while the offense tricks are making

their way down out of the house into the

gardens there's a crash from the other

side of the house as a window smashes

and then suddenly evil ones flying out

with a little girl in her arms and

paltin dimension doors out with a little

boy with him and you're able to get both

of the kids out of the house in a matter

of seconds

all right thanks to Palma magic yeah

this is like we're out and I see Li

Alice and the rest of the guard sounds

like wolf both Alice and the guards when

they see that you've got the kids

Alice sort of frowns and then draws her

sword and points it at UDF and says I'm

afraid I can't let you take them

Asmodeus won't allow it and that's where

we'll start

[Applause]

even Alice uh she was here to basically

kill anybody who escaped from the house

what if I kiss you a little bit so

Alice's treacherous inevitable betrayal

will be resolved not for a little bit

because we've got a bit of an intruding

element here next week there's no

extraordinary
