hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action our little D&D show set in water

deep a little dee dee show us now twice

as big than never before

that's right yes so the indie show that

could apologies for starting a little

bit late I had a meeting that collage

with this game and I couldn't get out of

it early so but here we are and Holly's

connections a little sketchy right now

so if she sort of spazzes out on this

don't blame her blame err

yep all right first before we get before

if the ground running here just wanted

to say happy welcome to our three

glorious guests hi that's you so much

for having a song so right way and

previously in dice camera action the

waffle crew arrived in Waterdeep got

into a few scrapes with the Santa Thor's

guild and the Santarem but set

themselves up in a nice house owned by

one Magnus Burnside's and have since

gone through numerous renovations

leading to this point when Strix could

finally open up her pastry shop her

bakery and I think it's also gonna be

like a bar is that right hello yes okay

supposed to be it's supposed to be a bar

because Alton was going to have a a bar

where the I don't know what it's called

kegger that's no choice so so so Holly I

assume there's some sort of there's

gonna be some sort of signage out front

right yes yeah exactly there's gonna be

the symbol of the chickens are coming

outside hanging from you know one of

those in rustic in looking yes I'm Geoff

okay and with probably like a little

what do you call those sort of wooden

placards stands that just sort of have

like menu items or pithy sayings or

something out front with with an arrow

pointing yeah okay yeah and the pimpy

sayings like change to like one morbid

thing after the next like that's alright

that's alright

and you also the the bunch of you had

your first encounter with dr. dr.

serenity thexa moth who's sort of taken

on the work of being your your psychic

Exorcist

that didn't go all so well but you know

there's hopefully hopefully you're all

better people this week so to kick

things and as you recall you have a

silent business partner named Al Coria

Stone marrow a dwarf wizard who has

basically been helping you get your

business off the ground and has been

funding some of the renovations of your

establishment with the goal that once

business gets up and running

she'll be paid back swiftly for her time

and effort and yeah if you've been

keeping okura al Coria has been feeding

d/f papers of just receipts so that he

can track the expenses as well many of

those papers got jumbled up but da tha's

recollected them and tuck them away

somewhere safe

for the record he hates it they're not

cool like maps or directions or anything

it's just like boring math and stuff

he's just like yeah with dwarvish

chicken scratches all over them ignores

yep

so our guests each of you is going to

have to make your way to the Waffle

House to to see Strix you've you know

the way having dropped off your resume

is some weeks ago and you are delighted

that you have been asked back for your

final interview now having lived in

Waterdeep for 1d 100 days you kind of

know how to get around in this big city

despite Waterdeep size it's not so big

that you couldn't walk across it in the

course of a day and most people get

about in the city by walking but

sometimes if they're feeling lazy or if

they have to get some more quickly the

primary method of transportation is by

coach or dray there's all kinds of

coaches there's there's your traditional

large coach that suits that seats many

there's hansoms that basically take two

passengers and have a driver station

behind them like an old English horse

wagon and then there's the big

double-decker bus like vehicles that are

pulled by horses down the street and

they're sort of the popular public and

cheap conveyance but they get where they

need to go quickly so I'll start first

with critter our little troubled so

critter kobolds in the city are

generally regarded at a glance as being

doglike which is to say people will

normally pay attention to a lone kobold

making his way to the city much as they

would a stray dog

unless that kobold is dressed like a

human being in which case they might

think oh that's a really ugly halfling

but how would you like to get to the

Waffle House

so critter lives mostly in the sewers

and the like kind of comes up to the

street level at night you know he

doesn't like the Sun very much so I I

would kind of Majan he would try to like

he's more familiar with the sewer

network in the city rather than the

streets yeah so he would probably try to

find his way through the sewers and to

the waffle house that way and if there

is still

hole in the basement you might find its

way up through that if if that's been

fixed he might you know pop out a man

holding you by okay no it's the bottom

floor at the very least right you've

still got the passage to the the sewer

in the basement but D F you could have

probably had it either gated or sort of

plastered over if you wanted it to I

would imagine would be sealed off in

some capacity with either a locked door

or gate or something there okay

that way our doorman minute or friend

down there has something to defend okay

for the sake of argument let's just say

it's like an iron wrought gate with a

path yeah that's some pretty simple

yeah that's fine okay so critter you

know the sewer the sewers well enough to

get yourself to a manhole cover that is

at one end basically the East End of

troll skull alley and you can pop out of

that's that sewer and it's really just a

you know about maybe 30 yards away is

the entrance to the Waffle House okay is

is it daytime anywhere asked to come at

daytime yes okay I'll pop out the

manhole cover travel up come out on

ground there you see you see as you look

around you some distance away there are

a couple or actually three halfling

musicians who are sort of getting set up

to play some music it's springtime so

it's good weather for them there also

you can hear the sounds of kids playing

but you don't see them so there's some

distance away there's nobody else around

okay

I'll uh I'll put my hood up over my head

so that my cloak so that the Sun doesn't

get my eyes and then torquey my eyes

down the ground as I rush towards the

door and when I get up to it just do a

quick little knock-knock

all right per lock ura locks Adan a

highly unusual creature to be seen in

this world if you want to talk a little

bit about where your character came from

so it was originally from a different

plane and just it's sort of he runs a

bed-and-breakfast slash in with his

parents and his two siblings but being

the oldest of the three and there's

plenty of help and it's a booming

business was just kind of this is like a

sabbatical kind of a finding away and

they're pretty well off with money so he

made his way just to a bustling city

where he knew there was a lot of

Commerce pretty easily just through

hired hands and has been living here for

some time during the Baker's guild and

just learning more about the outside

rooms okay as far as he knows he is the

only one of his kind in Waterdeep you

have seen no other laksa Don's around

and water davian's are by their nature

pretty chill and they've seen all sorts

of strange things magical and otherwise

but it never ceases to amaze the people

around you when you show up in a place

and then once you're once you're kind of

sort of kind nature manifests itself it

quickly dispels any misgivings they have

about being in the presence of an

elephant headed person of your size but

how would you like to make your way to

troll skull alley on this sunny spring

morning so being someone with a number

of different regular habits and being

very punctual and proper you would have

been awake probably two minutes before

dawn and about the same routine that he

went about every morning

taking a stroll to go get a morning

croissant and a tea and greeted the

people that he's you know become friends

with in the morning along the way and

would have just kind of had a nice

couple hours as the Sun was rising to

just spend some time walking through and

and maybe bartering for a few

interesting spices on the way and it

would have arrived and knocked on the

door precisely one minute before the

time the Houston okay great dear Anna

where do you spend your time in water

deep normally I was thinking she

probably like talked just like a more

easygoing person into letting her stay

with them okay and yeah is there a

particular part of the city where she

would feel most at home

there's the doc ward which is kind of

salt-of-the-earth people the buildings

tend to be a little bit more rundown but

there's the people who live in that area

are generally hard-working blue-collar

folks and then you've got the southern

Ward which a lot of foreigners live in

so it's got a very diverse looking

population and then once you get up away

from those two districts further north

in the city you start to see more kind

of your traditional Victorian what are

Davey and folk becoming all the more

richer the more north you go until you

get to the field ward at the northern

end the city which is basically a shanty

town I think she probably sees at the

doc ward because there are more seagulls

there than Ravens okay that's fair so

because she's staying at the dock word

she's about as far away from troll

Skelly as she can be and still be in the

city how does she want to get to where

she needs to go well given that she is

she can trance trance turley and got up

like middle of the night and then I

think she used her ability to speak with

animals to round up a bunch of dogs and

have them pull her along in like

children's

cart that she found okay so these stray

dogs basically lashed it to a cart

pulling her down cobblestone streets to

the best of their ability occasionally

you just sort of passed by some guards

who have basically got the graveyard

shift patrolling the town and whatnot

the occasional Lamplighter and they

honestly just don't know what to make of

you it should be noted that she's riding

in it standing up and she instead of

dressing like in an like a normal shadow

Kai she wants to like not really be

immediately read as one so she's

dressing in like the opposite in her

mind which is a lot of like really white

flowing outfits okay with like long

white hair so she looks like a ghost

going I was gonna say so

all these people these few people who do

watch her go by go home or go to

all-night taverns basically and start to

tell stories about the the the ghost

wagon pulled by Mastiffs and that

becomes a thing in water deep and so but

so you'll if you're traveling by night

you'll arrive at troll skål alley well

before sort of people are awake and

businesses are open and whatnot what are

you going to what are you going to do to

pass the time she probably just stands

in an alley nearby and wait sort of

staring at the building so people in the

building notice her they'll see her just

not creepy at all all right

in the early morning the usual happens

at the Waffle House which is I believe

correct me if I'm wrong waffle crew but

evylyn you're usually is it you or

deaath who's usually the first to rise I

think it's me okay but I'm like up on

the roof doing my like work out yeah

since you're up on the roof doing your

early-morning workout just make a

perception check for me evylyn

18 okay

at one point you glimpse a pale elfin

figure in an alley watching the house do

I find their posture threatening no you

wouldn't say threatening but as as it

happens you can make an insight check to

maybe try to glean intention 9 9 yeah

it's it's mystifying to you it's very

very creepy the stillness with which the

figure seems to be standing focused

definitely on the facade on your

building on the facade of your building

there are no weapons out nothing like

that it's just a strange strange figure

and it could just be a spy somebody

working for maybe this isn't Arum or the

city watch or who knows who knows

everyone does that thing where you like

see someone but you try to pretend like

you're not like staring keeps working

out you would see probably evil in

catching like the early morning light on

the rooftops of the building make a

perception check do that yes that's a 21

you do seem to meet her eyes at one

point as soon as there's eye contact

evylyn it's not gonna like pretend that

there wasn't into that how do you like

our house you say that in the early

morning when a bunch of people are

probably still just kind of waking up

but there's nobody else in troll skål

alley right now in this early morning so

you have no trouble hearing her dear 'no

i slowly wave umm what do I make of the

house

I have eldritch sight so I would see any

like magics on it I think as you glaze

at the

you can see that there is some sort of

spectral aura sort of faint and patchy

sort of drifting or oscillating over the

structure weekly in some areas stronger

in others moving almost like a

shimmering invisible curtain over the

structure so you do sense some magic

about the place beyond that it is a

multi-story sort of Gothic Victorian

monstrosity with pitched roofs Gables

many balconies and a turret on one

corner that's five storeys tall and has

a weather vane at the top oh wow I

didn't realize it was that big when I

blew it up oops the turret the top of

the turret looks newer than the rest of

the structure just wave back and I'm

like your houses magic could use a

little patch work to get it all evil and

it dawns on you dim recollection now oh

yes this is the morning when Strix said

that the coven members were going to

come by and you do recall glancing horse

or be hearing mention of one of the

final members that Strix chose being a

dusk elf or sometimes as known as the

shadow Kai oh my gosh are you dear nah I

would recognize you anywhere welcome

even flies down and like takes her arm

and she's like oh come on in Strix is

gonna be so excited to meet you

she sort of stumbles along she like had

like a big like entrance that so in

terms of timing dear now is the first to

arrive then there is a little knock on

the door signaling critters arrival

I'd imagine at that point yes away can

probably answers the door yep and it

opens it and sees critter and

immediately thinks to himself wow I'm

luckily halfling

that's a callback everybody

yeah that fainted that bit yes you see

you see this you see this like two and a

half foot tall reptilian doglike

creature in a cloak so was a where it

was death informed about death is D s is

absolutely well informed about

everything okay all right so so he knows

enough okay he part yeah he met whether

may he maybe he was too distracted with

other things to know who the finalists

were gonna be so he might be surprised

to learn that she picked yeah a creature

such as this but then you go oh yes yes

so do you probably open the door and

then looks down at critter with just his

eyes so just immediately calls for her

to take care of it okay yes am I on the

right place yes without even be able to

confirm exactly who this person is just

goes yeah you're in the right place okay

I stepped aside to like let him in I

walk in okay and about one minute before

nine bells when everybody is supposed to

actually show up there is a heavy knock

at the door I guess I'll go get by now

and by now everybody's been up for quite

some time and probably Strix has

actually got breakfast out for everybody

yeah it's like you know like before you

do like a really big like party or show

or something yeah she's just coming

around the house like cleaning like well

you ever know my god

she's like dusting and then like make

pies I'm like that's like running out

there yeah that's someone else she just

disappears and Darren I try to help by

making scrapple okay okay this goes down

starts making tea so the main the main

room the tap room if you will has where

the bar used to be

there's basically like this counter with

pies underneath it on display there's

also a splat section of counter where

people can get drinks and there's a wine

dispenser and a beer ale dispenser then

there's all sorts of tables about the

room with chairs surrounding them some

under windows some by a fire central

fireplace and some arranged around a

spiral staircase that leads up to the

second floor and as the morning wears on

Dara and critter and now per lock when

you show up with your big boom boom boom

on the front door and they let you in as

well at some point in the morning paltin

will make his way down and basically

just slump in straw divan cherubic his

favorite chair and just drink from a

flask around the same time or shortly

thereafter Warrington monks your

resident gift comes downstairs as well

expecting breakfast I would like

everyone if I can tell them like I'll

pop my head this man halt this man halt

evylyn also doesn't know where the main

which was the main hall he's like

hallway is it the taproom is it like

that must be the tackier hear me could

be like this hideous reaches into his

pocket and pulled out his map of his own

Manor when Warrington Munt sees you per

lock he sort of adjusts his monocle to

take a closer look at you from across

the room from where he customarily sits

while he waits for Strix to bring him

his breakfast usually with a newspaper

although there doesn't seem to be one

present today and palton is sort

dare I say sleeping in the chair about

five feet away from him tapping his foot

as though listening to some music in his

head but Warrington this gift looks at

you and without addressing you directly

turns to paltin and says a man with an

elephant head well that's great that

strains all credulity don't you think

people nothing from pollen and then he

comes up Warrington comes over to you

per lock and sort of stands over you

while you're sitting down not realising

that if you were to stand you'd probably

be a head taller than him I will stand

next to him but with a very joyful smile

like some crinkly little eyes and greet

him good morning and take both of his

hand and in both of mine and give us

like not in my head he sort of puts his

hands behind his back and clasps them

and looks you up and down like an

officer studying the attire of a lower

ranking officer and says oh the

creatures in this world that I trust the

ones I trust least of a very tall and

the very small you sir are the former I

understand and I just humbly it would

like to try to change your mind or

should you be nice to our guests if

you're gonna live here you're gonna have

to be nice she's poignant ly not doing

it I shall be as nice as decorum allows

under the circumstances

I do not see that I have really any say

in this matter I shall be over there

awaiting my breakfast it was a pleasure

to meet you oh the pleasure to meet you

and I'll take my seat again all right

oh they're having this conversation can

I try the mage Han or rusty nail into

Warrington once pocket

sure yeah go ahead make a

sleight-of-hand check to do so without

attracting his attention 15 you are

successful alright so they have all

gathered and the morning wears on Strix

and you realize that it is nearly that

time there's like she's made a bunch of

crude like welcome signs like just like

out of like bark like welcome to members

and like there's signs saying like how

much the pies are it's like lots of care

was put into it but it looks like it was

done by a psychopath so it's very it's

very sweet a sweet psychopath and so

she'll come out and you notice something

about our outfit is that she's actually

she actually looks cleaner she actually

like cleaned up and her quote she's

still dirty like just a little bit more

like she's standing up straight and her

cloak she's wearing a different cloak

with like a high collar and like her

staff he's got her staff glowing and

everything and she kind of like walks in

with a little air of confidence and she

looks everyone and she goes welcome

welcome everyone this is the start of

the Chickenfoot coven and i want to say

that it's very important that we are not

like those mages and wizards in black

staff tower because we don't learn magic

we know magic and what we're doing is

important and what we do is we make

people happy

so those people protect people in the

city but why would anyone want to live

in this city that doesn't make any sense

if they're not happy

so what we do is we make pies and we

know magic and we make them happy

because magic isn't just blowing things

up it's just being able to make people

happy make everyone happy and we might

also kill things on fire and this

strangest thing idea at the scene all

day even excitedly like yes okay likes

like sticks or staff on the ground and

like green light do you know like raises

their hand and says I only know how to

make one kind of pie and what's hard

it's not very sweet and it's kind of

flat and it gives a lot of people judge

a festive issues and you can sit here

and meet my friends and I will be right

back and she likes cuddles off critter

immediately starts sniffing around for a

meat-based pie all right you're able to

find it yeah I don't care

go Eagles it down all right with

utensils are without just like face full

of pride no this is baseball pie face

ball yeah yes this whole time probably

hasn't actually sat down for breakfast

or anything he's probably just standing

stoically somewhere nearby

arms likely folded her lack will stand

up and actually walk over to death and

ask him where the nearest wash basin is

you can direct him to a privy upstairs

on the second floor yeah it's like

rabbit there's a pretty right there up

the first flight of stairs smells up

that way first sorry Ian left and he'll

give

could bow and say that I would take my

leave for just a moment and he'll like

slowly lumber his way up there to wash

his hands before starting I was just

walking away ideas just like I'm trying

all right

Soper Locke has gone upstairs

Warrington is staring with horror at the

kobold eating that pie without any

utensils paltin is as far as you know

asleep sleep foot tapping in his chair

and you can probably start to hear the

kids and waffles stirring upstairs and

she's just like please we have to do

things that make people happy so you can

bake pies or do whatever or practice

your magic whatever you want to do now

strikes you know that in order for them

to really pass the final test they have

to earn the blessing of one of your

friends yeah she's trying to get them to

do that they just like fail they're

looking too anxious so she's like she's

nudging them in that direction like but

if they don't like if they're not trying

to make an effort then she's gonna push

them in their way okay so she's kind of

now just hovering by the like by the bar

like that like evil I'm like ah why

don't you guys get to know each other

is this when I administer the test she's

like yes this is it why don't you talk

to the shadow pie lady I'm scared of a

little scared okay okay so your point

you're pairing off evil in with deer net

yes all right

are you going to pair off any of the

others well I'll bring you back

downstairs by this point I will I will

look at him and then look India just be

like oh why don't you find out looks

like DF looks back at the laksa Don and

there's back its tricks arm still folded

and just says none of them are good

enough please feel like those like big

as much like big eyes as she can yeah it

kind of gives like a like stink face but

like the casting face is like that

sounds like a parent being like finds

like she's really close it's like fine

[Music]

I'm sorry there's so many birds here

that's all right I just add to the chaos

that's already happening within the

house yes yes you also you also have

some chickens in your kitchen so it kind

of makes sense that there'd be people

there would be bird sounds holding one

of the spectral chickens like a smaller

version your name can talk to animals so

she's probably having a conversation

with one of the chickens all right

they're talking perfect what are they

talking about oh my gosh

[Laughter]

yes she seems to take good care of you

until she plans to slaughter you for

food she doesn't know that and also

she's speaking chicken the chickens are

like MA that's great alright everyone's

gonna be like now is your final test of

joining the coven you have to make my

friends happy which i think is the

hardest thing to do at all evylyn kind

of squares her shoulders and clears his

throat and she's like yes uh dear nut I

will be the proctor of your test today

and I expect the utmost decorum as we

complete this and she pulls out a some

sheets of paper like she's clearly

prepared this as though it were an

academic situation she's like I have

both a written and practical test and I

hope that you will let me know when you

are ready and you may either read it or

I will read it to you if you feel more

comfortable but your score on this test

will determine whether you are fit to

join the Chickenfoot heaven with our

friends drinks hmm I suppose so okay she

takes out her ritual book which is like

clearly made out of skin and it has

ghosts like grab the book like all the

eyes and teeth like close and retract

and like when she moves her hand they

look just all like pop back out and it's

really unsettling

oh that's special she like shoves it

back in

evylyn does note that this would be

something Strix would be into regardless

that I guess yes to her it's like oh you

use a tongue for a bookmark so does

tricks that's great I'm gonna go

halten with my second pie in hand and

hop up on his lap I assume he's still

sleeping when you hop up on his lap he

disappears oh and you are now standing

in an empty chair

yes actually laughs because he knew it

and sit in the empty chair lounge

comfortably and then scarf down the pie

okay as you scarf down the pie there is

a clock sound of wooden feet coming down

wooden steps and coming into view on the

spiral staircase is a short maybe three

foot tall puppet man an animated

construct that looks like a a jester

marionette given life moving on its own

accord and it sort of moves its eyes

over the entire room taking in everyone

present and then sees you sitting in

Paulson's chair and it's almost like the

jaw just sort of unhinges and almost

threatens to fall off when he stares at

you gawking sitting in the chair

splattering it with bits of meat and

pastry flakes what the hell is that

that's mighty unsettling I like that one

mm-hmm

Simon will come over to you Strix and

tug on your robe what is it Simon did

you want to hurt me all right

well what do you what do you need do you

want do you want to do wanna bet are

kobold friends oh is paltin passed out

[Laughter]

HIDA fine fine Simon I trust you I trust

you to do a good job so you go ahead and

do that and later on I'll teach you to

make a pie - he climbs up onto the

counter onto one of the highest

cupboards sort of hard to reach up by

the the chimney flue and he opens it and

you're not you you're not even sure if

there's anything in this cupboard it's

not one of the cupboards you typically

use in the kitchen right or have used

and he pulls out a what looks like a

bottle of wine but it's got a tag on it

and he hops down with the bottle of wine

and leaves the kitchen he'll stop to let

you read the tag the tag says you must

down this entire bottle in under a

minute and not black out Simon will then

take it take the wine back and walk over

to the cobalt and when he gets to the

cobalt the critter you see this puppet

man stand before you he's got a bottle

of wine he thrusts it out at you

cork first as if it's asking you to take

it I'll tell you when you do you see you

see a little tag around the neck of the

bottle that has written on it

you must down this entire bottle in

under a minute and not black out seems

kind of realer but I mean I've drank

more seawater in less than a minute and

I'm out of time how bad could this stuff

be a pop open the top make a day off

make a check you can just pop the top

but cork flies off

the wine smells really potent Oh God all

right that's that smells like sewer

Cosway see right there I've just leaned

back in the chair and just glug glug

glug so all of you can see after the

puppet hands this bottle to the kobold

this bottle is about half the size of

the kobold yes tilt it up and as he's

drinking Simon's head just sort of turns

all the way around to look at the rest

of you and this keeps turning back until

he's facing the kobold again and I need

you to make a constitution saving throat

yeah I bet you do come on au natural

2020 okay so yes you drink it all you

empty the bottle then what do you do

because you are still you are still very

conscious I burps very loudly look at

the bottle I hate this bottle I almost

amaze me you said it well it's about

half the size of you okay oh oh I'm age

hand the bottle back over to the counter

and drop it down there strictly yes just

like the puppet man narrows his eyes at

you and then allows better holds up a

finger and then goes upstairs what what

does that mean oh it's not good I can

tell you that no yeah you're feeling

that you're feeling pretty lightheaded

at the moment and like you could almost

float off this chair now but you're not

in any danger of passing out or dying

that's good I'll stand up on the chair

and just start sort of giving a slight

sway dance back and forth

I don't think critters ever had alcohol

before so in kobold years critters

actually twelve yes all right

so Simon has gone and critters doing a

dance what are the rest of you doing

prologue walks up to DF and gives a nod

and says I don't believe we've been

properly introduced

my name is pearl Ock is a pleasure to

meet you but he very importantly doesn't

grab his hands like he did with the gift

because he's washed them but notice that

nobody else here has done that to

himself but still being very cheerful

and polite yeah yes is just like hello /

lock what brings you here to learn to

understand the more than I understand

people who are different from those that

I grew up with the greater I feel my

empathy is increased and it makes me

better as a person so it's just my my

when to travel for the next 20 years and

and learn the ways of diverse so you

would say you see yourself as an

empathetic person I tried to increase my

empathy yes mm-hmm so you'd say you

probably by crowd you know pretty good

feel it's like sort of insight on some

people you've met perhaps some people in

this room yes it's like looking up at

perhaps although as I said my my

understanding is only increasing with

time so if there's anything I may have

do to be of service to you please do not

hesitate to request and then his eyes

just crinkle again as he gives a

pleasant smile and a nod

mmm fascinating all right would you

would you happen to recall as much as

you can from the initial application

when it comes to the chicken cause

chicken foot coven of lemon Strix what I

happened to recall which information

anything and everything from the

application or the signs or whatever

actives that she did and then the he

starts to recite the various welcome

signs that he saw the way in but

purposely mispronounced was the one that

was spelled incorrectly and then I

thought the specific moment that he was

told to arrive you can tell that he's

got his his life down to a very strict

schedule and he knows exactly where when

he's going to be and how things how was

even his body moves

it's very measured and slow with

deliberate after all of that D it just

goes your attention to detail does not

impress me

that is interesting

I've learned something new today death

is like visibly annoyed by that like

firlock is just like so nice and just

happy to be here like his learning

things and yes just like ad Ethel be

like alright well I'm glad that you seem

to know so much about people and you've

been paying attention come with me

and then DF what kind motion him to

follow him up go to uh well say we'll go

down to the go down there hurry out the

hatch I'll look can you fit through the

hatch it's awesome yeah he can fit

through that okay yeah help bill Bob to

go to the hatch in bream

into the basement okay when you're down

in the basement you can see that it's

like a root cellar it's a low ceiling

locks down you kind of have to crouch

down while you're in here to keep from

hitting your head on the cross beams of

the floor above the ground is PD and

earthy underfoot but dry and you can see

that there are all kinds of shelves

along the walls containing supplies and

whatnot and a gate set into one wall

that leads to a sewer tunnel soon as

strikes are assessed Trixie's take him

into the basement Jesus like he's gonna

kill him once they get down there yeah

it's gotta go to one of the in the same

room of the Ale cellar he kind of

corners the odds down search like

digging around for something of brushing

away dirt or sand or something

and as he's doing this he'll continue to

speak to Porlock and says tell me

prologue what is it that you fear Oh a

variety of things typically just the

disappointment of others who've been in

my in the service that I provide to them

not much else really but that does part

of my journey is to learn more and to

decide what exactly there is to fear DF

seems pick something up from that corner

and then walks over to a like a small

table or stool kind of down there and

motions prologue to come forward and it

will say well then this should be easy

for you since all you want to do is

understand and I want to see exactly how

much you understand data unravels a

small pouch and empties its contents

onto the table and there are six

different gemstones all the different

cuts all the different colors all of

different types

yeth cop puts his hands out it has down

on both side of this do old and just

goes there are six gems here all worth

different amounts I'm not gonna tell you

which is which I want you to pick one

and doing whatever you want with it

there's also a nearby market using this

gemstone through outer means necessary I

want you to find something that you

believe is the most valuable to Strix

and get that to her to do you want me to

find the gem that is most bad or just

the item that is most I am simply

offering you a bargaining chip what you

do with what you do with it from there

is completely up to you understood and I

would like to over the the gemstones

that are in front of me

cast identify okay damn it

[Laughter]

for the goal of determining what if if

there's anything special about these

gems that other than just being gems

whether they might actually lead to

anything or allow for something to be

ascertained okay dia are these the gems

that you collected from the Zanna thar's

lair yeah or some of them anyway yeah

some of them okay so your identify spell

which costs you a pearl that's consumed

in the casting and the and an owl

feather you learn that none of these six

gems are magical and yeah just goes and

so it's like water off a duck's back it

just hmm and then based on this cryptic

message that I'm getting from from D F

in in all of the various like studied

observation of his surroundings or

anything is there anything that her lack

might just know that he'd be hinting at

or is it like he just being messed with

you can make an insight check 21 it's

pretty good D eighth are you deceiving

him dad muted so this seems like a

sincere request there's not you can't

really tell if there's like an actual

trick to the stones themselves but it

does seem like what he's saying to you

is exactly what he wants so I don't how

well do you know gemstones well I have

yes stone Connie probably doesn't help

me there but actually it would it would

okay so yeah I mean he's knows very well

the the working of stone yeah you can

tell the difference between like lapis

lazuli and onyx and hematite and okay so

with that I can tell you so the ones

that are before you aren't super

precious super valuable like hundreds of

gold pieces but they aren't nothing

either so they aren't very well cut a

lot of them are rough

there is a topaz the Jade a lapis lazuli

like Chris actually mentioned a peridot

a malachite and a rose quartz

okay so being thrown into this situation

and having no idea what any of this

means

and being a very direct person who is

still a little bit naive about the

workings of this pearl act turns around

and and goes right back up and directly

to Strix and questions here exactly do

these stones mean anything to you yes

would you

happy yes with that going on

what are Evelyn and deer knob to when he

goes sorry I was just gonna say when

evylyn was probably distracted by Simon

coming down deer and I probably used

thaumaturgy to make her own eyes glow

because she's a little crestfallen not

being able to do her dramatic entrance

so next time you use this next time you

look at deer nough her eyes are glowing

evylyn woo

your eyes sure are pretty thank you I'm

very proud of them well I would be too

if I had eyes like that

but hmm I mean we had business to attend

to

and I have prepared your test right here

would you like to read it or would you

like me to read it aloud to you yes

evylyn you could have probably if you

knew this was coming had time to set up

a small classroom upstairs like it has

like a like some sort of table as a

podium where you at the front and then

it has just one like desk little area

where like you could sit to take the

test and there's like a chalkboard on an

easel in a corner and I'm like really

pretty cursive yeah yeah sure no it's in

the back of the room even yes I dearness

I'm sorry I what are the rules for this

test I haven't taken a test since high

school

and I was wondering if wrong answers

will be met with switch capital

punishment uh no no capital punishment

for this one more just like do your best

and your best will I'm sure be good

enough that's the rule yeah so even just

like puts the paper on the desk and like

smiles and just kind of puts it shoves

at order and then stands at the front

like this picks up the paper

what's on the paper do you want me I

have it written down do you want me to

send it to you or do you want me to read

it to you maybe read it so everybody

okay so the first question it's all

multiple choice the first question is

finish the sentence vampires are

generally a attractive be evil see

potential allies D all of the above

[Laughter]

question about one of the about one of

the questions yes yes what's your

question

this first one yeah I need to know one

technical thing before I answer this is

sex with vampires considered necrophilia

you know no question is a bad question

in this bathroom

I'm never about that before I feel like

I need to like ask an expert

I wonder if paulten would know for now

just in case okay that seems right all

right / / lock your with Strix asking

her about the gems yes yes he seemed to

be a rather cryptic but but mentioned

that one of these would make you happy

or something along those lines and I

simply I don't know what's required of

me here if you would just

perhaps guide me a bit I'm really happy

which might not be the most healthy

thing in the world so I'm gonna go back

there and tell him that the most

important thing districts is him being

happy and then just put those on the

table and then you tell him that those

are his and he nods and turns around and

goes right back and does exactly what

she said all right the gems go back on

the table DF

we cheated so sorry I didn't realize

that there was a limit to the methods by

which this should be accomplished but if

you have a separate test you would like

me to try please do let me know I will

try my best

yeah it kind of holds his hand up to

kind of stop him for a moment he's like

and when you win two Strix and asked her

that with your great epithet did you

notice I noticed that she seemed rather

upset that her friends weren't

immediately happy so if there's anything

I'm going to do to make you happy I feel

like that might be the way to to

increase her happiness as well she did

tell you to the thing that would make

her happy is if the it was happy yeah

yes death will scoop up all the

gemstones and just goes come with me and

he'll go back out to hatch and will

actually lead her lock out the front

door and as he's doing this death will

just like call back out districts will

be back and from there lead Spurlock to

the market that DF visits every morning

okay it's a it's a good hike a pleasant

walk stroll as it were from the North

Ward and troll skull alley across the

high road into the neighborhoods of the

well-to-do down Shield Street to the

market which is in the castle ward and

already at this hour it's quite bustling

you pass many many pleasant sites and

once you're in the market all you're

assailed by all manner of color and

aroma as this is a market that I might

have been cruising through the regular

travel is unlikely likely you are well

accustomed to this market

is the main market in the city it's sort

of in the center of the city to the

north of the market there is a giant 90

foot tall statue with buildings built a

topit of a figure holding a hand up with

a stone sphere floating above that hand

that is a head as a well-known landmark

one of the walking statues of Waterdeep

called the god catcher to the south of

the market is another statue similar in

size but representing a different

creature or being this being a human man

known as the great drunkard because of

his sort of crouched drunken posture and

there are buildings built around him as

well and he appears he looked smaller

because he's actually the statue is

seated or in a sitting posture but these

two gigantic statues basically have the

market which is huge tucked between them

and with all the activity going on

there's there's plenty of distractions

I'm just dogged Lee following behind

very slowly lumbering and stopping

whenever he stops yeah

dee Ethel basically lead them through

and stop them at certain stalls and

basically it will point out very

specific ones like he'll go to show up

rowlock the first stall and just be like

they handcraft rings here and sell them

get them sized for anything you want put

any kind of engraving you want on it you

can touch any kind of gemstone there's

very simple jeweler but I know they live

here in motto keep nice it brings

prologue to the next doll this one's

really interesting I see this every

morning they sell like all kinds of

different parchment and writing things

like they got all kinds of different

empty books they got tomes they have

some like some ink and quill and all

kinds of different like writing utensils

and things their leaves / locks that

next stall this one this one is very

nice this is all

and crafted cooking utensils made from

trees that aren't even in on the sword

color so they claims look at they got

spoons and hands and cutting boards and

all kinds of things that man I don't

really understand brings prologue to a

final stall I mean this these drops kind

of trinkets and things but some of them

are pretty fascinating look we got like

claws of things I think that's a tooth

of a different creature Tufts of hair I

guess they could be spell components

probably know more about that than I do

and then he turns to Porlock and opens

up his hand and showe the gems again and

says which one would Strix liked the

most

hmm can I make any sort of insight into

this or would he just be completely

flying blind

I mean he based on your intuition ups

tricks and like what you know of her and

how she you're briefly interactions with

her and from like applications and the

things right right I meant like like

from his historical pouch if he's

constantly taking this information and

we really kind of given things wrote

would he have any knowledge that I as a

human do not have I guess make an inside

check that's a natural one yeah good

luck buddy and welcome to bluff drew

skipping off to critter critter after

evylyn takes deer nough upstairs and

deaath take Spurlock out you feel

somewhat neglected the gif has had

enough of you Warrington leaves and so

you're kind of alone for a bit you can

hear Strix though clattering around in

the kitchen as before getting ready for

opening day and all that business and

then you hear what sounds like hammering

sounds and sawing noises from

stairs and a few minutes later the

puppet man comes back down again and he

has fashioned what appeared to be a pair

of stilts oh my god drunkenly stumble

towards the puppet man yes he is

expecting you to follow him I will

drunkenly stumble behind him

all right he will lead you outside and

down out of troll skull alley and down

Del Zorin Street and at some point and

he's just got these two stilts over his

shoulders and he looks behind you to

make sure that you can you continue to

follow him make another Constitution

saving throw for me what all this

exertion coupled with all this wine I'm

not under the Sun it's just like at one

point when you get to the corner of Del

Zorin Street and the high road you have

to stop briefly and just kind of retch

and so I'm Simon Simon just waits there

patiently until you're done and then you

you have to cross the busy street I'd

like you to make a dexterity save to

cross the street you think he gets

points to assignment 24 okay yes you're

able to weave between the traffic and

the Dre's zipping by and not get run

over or squashed the Simon continues to

lead you down the length of Dell's Oran

Street for a good long way crossing

almost the breadth of the city into a

place a section of the city that's all

wealthy villas and well manicured lawns

until you get to a street called the

street of the singing dolphin and then

you turn left and then you turn right

onto Diamond Street and he seems to be

taking you to the West Gate this is the

the west gate of the city kind of is

built into the outer wall of the city

that over

looks the see and this this gate unlike

many others in the city is not well

populated or well staffed because

there's very little traffic that ever

comes through here about the only people

who come through the West Gate are those

who for whatever reason need to get to

the shore or want to get to the shore

but as you walk through the gate guards

look at you very warily because they

don't usually see a puppet man with

stilts and a cloaked wretched reptile

boy moving not really in a straight line

but kind of zigzagging his way behind

this puppet trying to keep his feet but

when you they let you through unmolested

and when you look beyond the West Gate

you can see the vastness of the sea of

sorts the waves beating up against the

rocky shore and between the wall of the

city and the water is this great expanse

which you don't know but which the city

folk called the mud flats because it's

not a sandy beach it's just this big

sloping muddy morass and then he hands

you the stilts am I supposed to do with

this he drops the stilts in front of you

and puts this puts his hands on his hips

and looks at the stilts then looks at

you then looks at the stilts then looks

at you now these stilts aren't

sophisticated they're basically poles

with little wedge-shaped things to put

your feet on at the bottom so you can

hold the poles with your feet on these

wedges and basically be about two feet

taller than you normally would be

Paulson what a man about all this oh I I

guess I'll look at Simon and see if I

can do

Herman if if he wants me to walk across

the mudflats like does he see me

indicating okay okay all right

oh yeah I'll tell you and then he'll

point um he will point out to a spot and

you can make a perception check to sort

of follow his finger to see what he's

pointing at 2800 so he is pointing

northward up the mudflats and you think

a good distance away are some rocky it

basically some rocks coming up out of

the water and he seems to be pointing to

one of the rocks or there abouts and so

you think in order to get across these

mud flats to that rock and make any

progress you'll probably need the stilts

well I don't really get your test here

at little wooden man but okay and I'll

put on the stilts to start droppin make

a dexterity saving throw at a

disadvantage because you're drunk 11

okay so you go first you're on the

stilts you're very shaky but you sort of

get your balance after a couple tries

then you go out into the mud and you

start to walk in it and then immediately

you sort of get stuck and then your

weight just sort of slowly carries you

forward and you fall face-first into the

mud and sink into it this is why I

always stand their ground okay I don't

try to push myself like out of the mud

claw out of the mud make a strength

check - you can't move deer back in the

classroom

back in the classroom evylyn are you

ready for the next question

yeah question number two is do you like

pie a yes B no C only some kinds D if

you want me to do you like starts a

noticeably sweating hey okay simple

straightforward answer alright are you

ready for the next one

question three if your party fell off a

boat what would you do a swim to safety

I can't help anyone if I drown first

B try to keep the rest of the party's

heads above water at all costs C

let's call upon some higher power or

special favor D die I can't swim poor so

that's like I mean I guess like I I

could grab one person teleport with them

to shore and then teleport back and then

grab another person and then and then

teleport with them would you say that's

like a higher power special favor or

would you say that's like I suppose it

would be using the powers granted unto

me by my patron yeah I would say that's

the higher power or special favor I

suppose yes that one look at you you're

going so fast you want the next question

yes I will destroy all these questions

okay great if a vampire hunter told you

that you had to die to save your friends

would you

a yes/no question see yes but with some

to lots of questions see no I wouldn't

believe him he no I don't care that much

about my friends this question is not

entirely applicable because when

Shadrach I died the Raven Queen takes

their souls and resurrects them but if I

if I did that then then the Raven Queen

would have me and then she would get my

secret and that would be bad

I mean death is never really super

permanent anyway

yes but the Raven Queen getting you is

bad true

so I mean she's upset with you so are

you saying you would not die is very

complicated question if I know how much

I know these doing how old do I know

these people I guess that the answer

would probably be B I would have a lot

of questions okay that's fair should I

continue asking questions yes I'm so

glad I'm so glad that you're reading

these things out loud okay next question

if a goblin was mean to you what would

you do a keep trying to befriend them be

pretend they don't exist

see cast spells on them until they calm

down D leave them to their brother I

feel like I need more context for this

this seems like a very specific sort of

question that I don't have all the

information for you know sometimes life

just doesn't give you all the

information that you and you have to

just follow your heart well I am

proficient in the use of the medical the

medicinal uses of many herbs so I would

probably slip them something to make

them calm down and maybe be more

friendly but I wouldn't do that to

people I know because I would be mean

but if it was a mean random goblin that

I didn't know I would probably do that

because that would mean that there would

be probably less violence okay so see

I suppose yes okay we're doing this

together this is great

skipping to the market d/f under the

under the Morning Sun you've got

merchants coming up to you asking if

basically after after your business

asking if you want to buy this want to

buy that they'll offer you deals keep

shooting them away yeah in the meantime

pro lock is standing there the gazaís

are almost closed he's almost meditating

and in this bustling market for like a

good minute and a half that's kind of a

really long time and mm-hmm you're like

deep like humming it seems like he's

thinking a lot and finally he opens his

eyes and looks down right in front of

him and says it sounds as though strix

once for her happiness for you to be

happy and for all of this it seems to me

that what would make you happy is is

simply that I fail so I concede and then

at random he picks the rose quartz and

then just kind of stands there with his

hands folded holding it just waiting to

hear that he failed after a poignant

pause d/f of like putting a hand on the

locks of bonds like kind of albacore

arms like he passed the first part

hey I understand takes the picks up the

rose quartz from his hand and just says

I know how much this is worth but it's

irrelevant here you can't really put a

monetary value to some things like this

is just a bargaining chip and I showed

you a lot of things this market maybe

you maybe you know to something that I

didn't again this just helped me pick

out something for strikes hmm well come

let's do this together and lead him back

to the first the the handcrafted rings

thing and and we'll very slowly take him

through all four boots and have a

conversation as we're going through and

asking him what he thinks and offering

what little input I can give based on

the little interaction I've had but

probably spending a little bit extra

time at the cooking utensil stands

that's my wheelhouse mm-hmm

so we go back to the rigging stand as

soon as you start talking a little bit

about des just can't wave his hands

because now this this one was the trap

don't

this was not the answer so don't worry

about this one mm-hmm

got back towards uh the place of all the

writing utensils she's looking at stuff

he's like it's like I know she likes all

this magic stuff and you know she's

making up this whole pie thing maybe she

needs what's like write her own like

recipe book or something so maybe that

would you know maybe that would work for

it I don't know maybe just like a nice

quill so that she could write all these

things down or write anything she wants

at the cooking utensils seasons yeah it

has no idea what most of the things are

actually used for so he takes like a lot

of your advice and and deaath also says

I don't even know which ones she

actually has and then the the components

stand for lack of better term da this

guy says this just all seems like the

easy

way out like I know she just likes weird

things but I think a lot of people's

kind of give her weird or different

objects and I don't know it's there's

more I can get written bet that is

picking one at random I'm just giving

that to her right Pirlo he realized this

is so much information what if what you

gave instead was knowledge rather than

an object something that could be used

and enjoyed in perpetuity in perpetuity

Wow I don't you think I can actually

teach her well I'm if she's opening in a

business people always appreciate

something new and exciting that they

haven't tried before I do have a

wonderful recipe for bread pudding you

you do oh yes yes it's it's what my

family is known for at home I I can

actually find all the ingredients here

if you'd like to try it yeah

DFO actually take out one of the other

gemstones and hand over to prologues

just take this it should be more than

enough to go get whatever you need you

go do that I think I know what I want to

give her so while he buys that deaath

we'll go back to the portrait place okay

and buy probably a nice tome that'll

buff ice as a cookbook for her little

inkwell and then just the nicest quill

that you could possibly get there and

deport some of whatever creature that

you come up with critter you're still

lying face down in the mud the Sun is

hot on your back and starting to bake

you and then and then you feel mud being

thrown on top of you really not good I

reached in my pocket and pull out my pet

shrimp filbert and said about the

turrets they go go for help filbert

all right filbert goes off in near and

near panic realizing what's happening

I'll attempt to a mage hand the dirt

back off of my back yeah you're able to

sort of keep some clear around your head

so you don't suffocate under the sucking

mud and then I'll keep trying to pull

myself out of it make another strength

check - okay you're sick you didn't

think it was possible that you sink a

little deeper into the mud and it's it

the the mud is it feels almost like it's

grasping onto you and trying to hold on

to you forever and ever and ever it's so

sticky and so unpleasant and and clearly

Simon realizing that you have no hope of

passing the test is just burying you

alive twist at all to see him a little

bit but it's hard like you can sort of

kind of twist your head as far as you

can to try to look and then this big wad

of mud just goes almost on top of your

face can I even obviously tie see can I

see him well enough to throw chromatic

war vadym uh let me just check the spell

if it has so mattock components then no

it does yeah you can't you can't make

any kind of gestures at the moment I

guess I'll try to plead for my life now

please don't bury me alive I'm too

pretty to die and I doubt we'll have any

effect I do have the feature coward

Bravo and PEG oh very good yes this is

this is perfect this is absolutely

perfect will grovel cower in bed okay

then make a persuasion check with

advantage okay

17 okay

he stops throwing mud on you and sort of

grabs you and kind of pulls you up a

little bit so that you're not in any

danger of like literally suffocating

he felt he seems to feel but the looking

he doesn't have much expression but what

little expression he has suggests that

he thinks you're pathetic but that

you're probably too pathetic to bake and

die out here in the mud oh thank you

little wooden man your mercy will go a

long way he points to the rock so I'll

truth be told the rock is hundreds of

yards about 300 yards away well there's

the wall where we came from the way you

came from which is sort of standing tall

and mighty to your east blocking any

view of the city beyond that's closer

than the rock yes yeah the wall you're

sort of moving parallel with the wall as

you head toward the rock okay if he's

pulled me up far enough I can get my

feets yep I'd like to attempt to stand

again okay great so look at him look at

the rock look at him look at the wall

and then just look it for solid ground

just okay okay so you're basically

trying to like stay as close to the wall

as possible I'm just trying to back to

the solid ground that's not it's gonna

swallow me and okay but there's no you

don't see anyway moving across ground to

get to that rock what

crossing okay okay all right

so you leave the silks behind and you

run towards solid ground and he's he he

just looks at you running away he looks

at these two stilts sticking up out of

the mud

and then he just shakes his head strix

you here you were kind of busy in the

kitchen you weren't sure you heard a

knock at the door cuz the birds are

making a lot of noise and then you

realize you hear sort of the creaking of

floorboards suggesting that there is

somebody in the tap room and then you

hear a voice say not very loudly hello

oh you see a figure in this tap room

that kind of scary

imagine you you know the character of

lurch from The Addams Family oh yeah

from like the original TV series imagine

imagine a female version of that okay

wearing sort of a torn almost vagabond

like clothing and my a stove top hat

that's sort of moth-eaten

and decrepit okay no no but there's

there is something kind of well what the

hat on this figure stands about eight

feet tall eight and a half feet tall and

is carrying a suitcase in one hand and

says I'm here and she says I'm here

towards my test

you got my resume did I get I just like

start like looking I don't have papers

I'm just looking in my rope yes my god

clearly I am the best choice Jill said

the she'll set the suitcase

she'll walk toward you then set the

suitcase down on the floor and he/she

says I am mandragora she practically she

practically crushes your head in her

high in her iron like grip and she says

so what's my test well your test is to

make someone happy all my friends are

currently being made happy so you don't

have to maybe you can make up well she

says leaning down toward you then I'll

make you happy she says is this the

kitchen and she kind of pushes her way

past you into it yes very good very good

oh look at these delicious creatures

mm-hmm wait why chickens and then she

leads down a dose yes I see and this is

your cauldron collection lovely no

cooking not chickens or people you like

what is your what is your kitchen

missing uh it's missing what is it

missing what is my kitchen missing she's

looking around I mean definitely not

cages you look like a cage in the

kitchen kind of lady you know

she she sort of she starts to rifle

through things like drawers and stuff

and she pulls out like a rolling pin and

looks at it and kind of scornfully and

then she she looks at some herbs hanging

on the walls and she kind of rifles

through them and sniffs them like she

gets she gets right up in your space

[Music]

she's like trying to like put everything

back every time that she takes them but

she's also talking herself down she

tries the door on the stove and it kind

of makes a squealing noise that she

finds appealing and she closes that she

sort of sniffs in the stove and she says

yes a cook a baker all those things lots

of practice in the kitchen I'm good but

you don't need the kitchen you don't

need people right and then she says you

know what this kitchen could use Wow I

think you have something blocking your

chimney maybe it needs to be cleaned I

mean I've never really looked up in

there so maybe she kind of sticks her

long arm up into the stovepipe and feels

around comes down and it's all covered

with black soot and then she just sort

of smear something on her face and neck

which is I I have just the thing and she

goes back out to her suitcase I'm going

to like working here very much through

the advertisements of course no one is

better equipped to help you get this

covered off the ground than me and so I

assumed you would need my services are

you from water deep

no but I applied for the job originally

from the vey wild I have great memories

of there she pulls out she pulls out

basically what looks like a duster on

the end of a rod that that's basically

like a collapsible pole it's basically

four used for cleaning chimneys okay

structures like also trying to talk

herself down like I'm a charge and she

she starts cleaning the stove

she just Rams this thing up in pulls it

back down and big clouds of soot billow

out behind her do i inside check can i

inside check her real quick

mm-hmm yep just feel like is this like a

my I don't know I don't know trying to

try to gauge the wee-woo so we'll just

keep it all right

meanwhile upstairs evylyn and I stepped

away for a moment

oh I'm sorry yes we'll go back to DA

then okay uh I'd imagine firlock went

off and God follow his recipe

ingredients yes yes and didn't spend the

stone that was given to me instead spend

his own money in his planning so death

will have a good-sized tome like like a

stereotypical like wizard no but instead

got it customized so it says Strix is

strict his bakery book on the front he

bought he also bought some ink and then

bought a very large feather probably of

something that's

add like a Hippogriff or something like

that and so per lock MDS old jack up yep

and yes will ask for like I know that

you know something of magic right I I

know some things although particular

magics are a little more foreign to me

than others

okay well so I wanted to do this thing

and I'm hoping that you can help me do

it because I'm not sure if this is even

a possible because I know less about

magic than you do the deaath holds up

the feather and it says I want to

enchant this feather and infuse it with

with with feeling mm-hmm like with like

an emotion is that is that something

that we can do it's all right

I personally I sometimes calm emotions

although I don't know if I have ever

attempted to infuse that ability into an

object is certainly something outside of

the the realm of my experience but I I

don't see why we can't try well if you

want to pass your test gonna try and

he'll reach both those hands out for the

feather in died keep holding on to it

and just says no just it's not it's not

really feeling I could describe just one

I can do so just whatever your enchanted

ritual is just just do that as I try to

give it the emotion hmm well here we go

yeah well while you're focusing on that

he's going to to cast calm emotions at

third level and try to bend it in a way

that he's never done before and I'm and

latch on to both DDS emotion and the

feather at once so as he's doing this DF

just takes the feather and his bestie

can basically bring it close to his body

and just try to hug it and it works

[Laughter]

except yeah it's basically the same

emotions that they shared back right

right after the whole Asmodeus thing

basically so that anytime strix holds

this feather she feels that same hug all

right

maybe we could we could make him roll

and see how badly he about I mean

it could explode up into my face roll I

know

no it just works okay yeah that's cool

yeah this is yeah there's no visible

effect it's only basically UDF who can

really even sense that this has worked

okay but yeah the feather has changed

somehow

Anna yes you've gone through much of the

questionnaire now with this young coven

acolyte where where are you at now you

said well you've sort of grilled her

quite a bit there are a few more

questions on the test but even kind of

feels like she has a really good sense

of of her charge but she wants to ask

the final question on the test okay

if you love someone you should a tell

them immediately B tell them never see

tell them if they tell you first think

about it for a long long time and then

probably tell them maybe this is a scary

glimpse into a whole new world dear not

[Laughter]

particularly because you can see

Evelyn's eyes getting bigger and her

attention even more rapt just looks at

evylyn says that in order to king an

acceptance in the coven I'm supposed to

make people happy but it seems like

based off of this question that there is

someone else in your life who probably

would be the one who would be most

likely to be able to make you happy and

I don't really have much authority here

I don't understand this situation and

yeah I would I don't know

Oh like answer e you're adding your own

do what they want Leslie I am a very

good example of a witch Leslie answering

e oh wow I think that deserves extra

credit okay that ends the written

portion of the test now time for the

practical and even takes her sword and

hacks a cut in her arm and she's like

first aid triage go practice

we has her medical supplies out and that

is a natural 20 with excellent

evylyn you have never seen field work

triage like this before

even like strokes her healed arm and

she's like I think that may be better

than I could do you surprised me that

was WOW well you just passed with flying

colors let's go tell strikes now and she

grabs during a runs down the stairs

drags along right in the air behind

deaath you and par lock armed with a

feather make your way back from the

market as well

arriving coincidentally at the same time

that evylyn and Dianna rushed downstairs

you can see that there is a fair amount

measure of panic constricts his voice

that wasn't there earlier in the morning

and when you go into the kitchen Strix

and this ginormous lurch like woman are

strangling each other what it has been

reduced to this this bigger woman is

shouting hire me hire me a ceaseless you

all see this she probably good as like

go over to Strix grab her and then try

to thunder stuck with her away I will

cast calm emotions on the angry top

handed lady

okay so dear nut grabs tricks and and

shadows away this not evening that spell

thunder step Oh

under set because that's right yes so

describe that for me you touch her

basically and then you just sort of with

a loud clap disappear yeah well it's

more like a

boom that does 3d10 damage with a

constitution safe to half okay

she failed that so Roy your damage and

that she also failed they calm emotions

effect so this would be bunny dang

okay so that is a twenty five total all

right so she takes all that Thunder

damage she just sort of absorbs it is

there any other effect besides the

damage the Thunder can be heard up to

three hundred feet oh oh great yes the

neighbors are once again aware of your

presence and then the calm emotion spell

takes hold of her is there a particular

thing you want you're hoping to get out

of that spell per lock well it just said

that you can make the target and

different about creatures of your choice

that is hostile toward okay yeah

all right so suddenly after getting

blasted and being rattled by this damage

which causes the shutters to creak and

the glass to shake and things to fall

off to rattle on shelves she suddenly

becomes very very calm and she says I

don't know what came over me I'll come

back tomorrow and she'll go she'll make

her way toward her suitcase she'll pick

her hat up off the floor and then make

her way toward her suitcase yeah you

should sort of move out of the way you

let this big shambling figure in the top

hat leave I would like to go to the door

immediately close it shove a bunch of

dirt and mulch in the doorframe put a

bunch of seeds in there and use druid

craft and like a bunch of vines go out

to like seal the door shut yes Strix

Strix while your research

recovering from your experience the

thing that sort of that surprised you

most was as when she suddenly when this

figure suddenly had lost her temper and

attacked you because it was clear to her

that you hadn't actually picked her for

the job that you saw in an instant that

her the illusion of who she was sort of

almost shed away for an instant and you

saw her real face and it appeared to be

that of a a black haired yellow tooth

wearing the skull of what looked like a

bison over her head holy SH it's over

her face and that image sort of burned

itself into your psyche but now you see

your your friends are back or rather two

of your friends are back with two of

your coven members I say to you you're

welcome

where is where is critter critter so

critter you've made it to the wall of

the city on to firm rocky ground leaving

Simon at the edge of the mud with his

stilts what do you do he Sprint's to the

nearest sewer entrance yep

and that attempts to sprint through the

sewers to the nearest exit at the Waffle

House okay pops out of the manhole cover

runs up to the door and just starts

pounding on it

endlessly so there's a pounding on the

door which has all these leaves and crap

stuffed around it

courtesy of dear nut so you're pounding

on the door does anybody want to let him

in I feel like after after that the

district is even listening to the door

and like I like probably like some kind

of writing is on the outside that says

the coven is closed for today is their

window there are windows so recognize

critters boys I'll open a window for him

okay a window opens

since camera okay yeah scampering just

completely out of breath what is that

thing deep and evil one yes with flying

colors and extra credit yep
