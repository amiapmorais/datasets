mess of things so I hope you're ok with

that absolutely counting on it it's the

only way this is gonna work where do we

begin we begin

by taking out our signature dice oh yeah

but extra shots to wormwood for making

us these custom character symbols on

which are super cool it also has our

signatures on it it's pretty sweet which

is super cool of them check out our wood

down the exhibition floor just a little

commercial to start us off so we begin

it is is water deep you guys are in the

Waffle House I honestly don't know where

your last episode left off so we'll just

pretend everything was great yeah that's

usually accurate yeah good night's sleep

actually the last episode we had just

finished installing an extra like four

floors great a lot of upgrades note one

floor per person it's a beautiful long

rest do you get it you get all your

shots back it's it's around midday and

the mail has just arrived today is it

well fortunate because there happens to

be a piece of mail for you here strict

say that that's my favorite way we got

mail here we've always gotten mail why

did I get a peel box never that you

don't you remember we literally just got

a letter to go to the auction do you not

recall remember the rug that was in the

mail Oh our mail to be fair I tried to

block that out that was really trauma it

probably not well it's how about roll a

d20 if you open that oh no the male's

going to attack her alright King you got

a ten yeah you open the mail okay

so Strix will notice the mail and say

its address districts be stinger and

they've used my adopted surname so I'm

just preparing us all for this are we

all in wrong they don't know we get to

go to a party oh there's a bunch of

things in it I hope Prudential hold on

I like pulling my cloak over me and I'm

like it says confidential come on Strix

I want to know and then I start reading

it out loud please

dee restricts it is with a heavy heart

that I must regrettably invite you to

the funeral of your adoptive grandmother

Rosemarie what boy she can't be dead

whose sudden mystery is dead she can't

be dead you're talking about has lots of

perhaps tricks like starts to cry a few

tears yeah they might be real they're

real the service will be held today in

the Waterdeep market additionally I

entreat you to do is this in Rosie's

handwriting by the way definitely not

okay

Trix is suspicious I can treat you to do

one last favour for your late

grandmother

it is my suspicion that one of your own

adoptive family members is to blame for

her death

oh and closed-door my four prime

suspects oh please investigate it all

and find the culprit and perform

swiftest justice upon them she ran in a

room I think your loving brother whom

you have never met Oh Anna ho and Joe

Lee Oh unholy oh and holy oh I hear a

boy and a holy OB singer PS the funeral

have an open bar

guys we really really need to get to

this view oh there's wait hold on wait

it says oh and closed door my 4o prime

suspects tricks

evylyn do you say oh my god it's a

murder miss

they think that we open these - I didn't

give instructions s I don't think she's

dead I can't she can't die

she's like oh she can die she's immortal

or something no she's already opening

hers oh it's a portrait oh it's so

pretty

look it has this beautiful but potato oh

these are the people or afters we didn't

do it these people did it yet none of

you murdered Rosie we could blame for a

watch so just throw that out there all

right miss pheasant she'll find you all

wager wait why are you laughing

cuz I already get it seems that wait a

second this is cool oh my gosh it

totally is I suspect real rear-admiral

ketchup where does it say we'll find

ketchup at the condiment bar

apparently he'll be presiding over the

entire funeral you might have been the

one who arranged it oh well I'm pretty

certain it was instructor indigo and

probably let her jugular with those

cheekbones y'all should put them in

there yeah okay

look at those see their cuz I think it

was maybe priestess prune and you be in

the temple of saloon like that little

Ron Yeah right

it's pronounced Aluna

look it's pronounced let's say Andrew

pronounces things however he he probably

does that letter okay idea that will

take us and immediately like start

scouring over it trying to make sure

it's like legit in looking for okay do

you think that's Rosie's handwriting I

don't know I've never seen her write

anything well while you're doing that my

guys out of Tavern so I should probably

go inside they're all gonna be in the

funeral yeah but oh wait open bar okay

open bar then tap yeah alright an

investigation check okay I don't get to

do that very often intelligence

investigation I uh I actually have skill

points in this this is extra exciting oh

yes here let me move best oh oh oh it's

pretty good it's gonna be a total 24 oh

okay

so as you examine this letter you're

looking over for clues this this all

seems pretty legit to you there's

nothing there's maybe some teardrops is

clearly someone was was feeling quite

sad about this the the ink appears to be

from water deep water fee is one of like

a someone who isn't like mass producing

these or trying to hide no this is this

is clearly handwritten okay and you're a

you're not sure who and holy O is but

it's possible that there that's there's

a lot of be singers that you don't know

I know very little to bestow her family

but wait is she really dead oh she's

really dead she can't be dead fifteen

she's dead no sex is like we're gonna go

to her funeral and save her from from

death back to life you do that yeah what

do you need do you need those diamonds

cuz I need diamonds to do it do you need

diamonds Chris isn't here I'm really

concerned with what little weight we

give to death now

like she's dead I was just like oh it's

fine whatever I'll just go to a party

we'll bring you back for I thinking I

think just trying to raise Rosie back

would cause more chaos do you think four

suspects are actually going to be there

present at the funeral and there to be

there for a reason to make sure that

their work is completed that they say

something go awry that could cause even

more chaos if not to Rosie or ourselves

perhaps even the other people there

so if but if if she were resurrected

would that just instantly put all of

them off the hook if she's not dead

she's still murdered oh yeah but if

they're not dead and they didn't murder

you you noticed there's another piece of

paper in the envelope eze PPS Rosie

specifically did not want to be

resurrected she's lived a long life oh

well that's too bad

all right all right I mean if she wants

I mean that's the thing sometimes people

people want to move on until the next I

don't believe that hey we're gonna save

her let's go to the funeral well strix

of everyone you know Rosie the best

would you have to know she had any kind

of known enemies or anyone who had watch

it probably probably lots all right okay

well we need to figure out which of

these suspects we are going to will be a

question first

definitely instructor indigo seems

really really suspicious like who

frequents a tavern that's weird that's

there that's it's definitely I mean dia

it's evil and is trying to look very

official like she's trying to mimic

everything she's seen from being

adjacent to the city guard like her

posture seems like Todd and her voice

kind of seems like Alice of course we

need to interrogate she looks at me if

for the approval and it's a bit

aggressive I we need to ask them a few

cool easy question we want to keep a low

profile so they give away the clues so

Lowepro

nowhere it wasn't on my mind but it's

not a terrible idea

if nothing else if they're going to be

there we should be keeping an eye on

them if any sort of suspicious behavior

also if it's full of bee stingers I feel

like they'll know who I am maybe so

maybe like we should disguise ourselves

perfect I'll get my mustache don't stay

up to fix you should go as a paladin

[Laughter]

well you know what paladin is right oh

yeah I do

so you can just go I don't I mean I

don't have any armor I can't change I

can only alter my appearance I can't

change what I'm what if we switch

outfits we're not the same size that's

true yes we're not switching out if I

switch outfits so I mean does your

outfit really have a size no it's one

size fits most

these Strix yeah what if we switch

outfits so I'd switch outfits with you

yeah cool so I'll wear your outfit and a

mustache it's rain so do you want like

the do you want the the purple jacker

you want the robes and the slippers oh I

don't want this drawn slippers

okay screwed mixed mix those we don't

want those okay so you're wearing the

purple party coat look equally Oh

I'll drink it isn't it so much shorter

than me it's just not going to fit me

that's fine I'll wear that thing I wore

to that party

oh yeah wear that with the mask and

we're that the aisle dude I'll just

polymorph myself I don't need to have an

outfit but you would look so cute in

that jacket do you want a mustache I

have a second okay great

two mustaches okay I'm wearing Paulson's

party jacket okay it doesn't fit me

can I wear your the outfit you don't

like anymore the vest who said I don't

like it

well you don't wear it anymore doesn't

really like it can I borrow it

sure do you wait I have a more important

question is this the stuff you wear to a

funeral shouldn't we be wearing black

did we did we already hand over the

cloak no no okay well that's anyway my

outfits already black I'm wearing what I

own okay I know outfit switching what we

go now - yes please

yeah are we going to the tavern first

well that's course it seems more like

did this a twitch tavern he liked to

hang out toward tavern okay so we have

several locations we could start off

with and perhaps ask people there to see

if they if they were frequent patrons if

they hadn't noticed anything that might

be might be a good place to start for

Admiral ketchup it sounds like he'll be

at the funeral itself so we'll save him

for last there's ladies know that that

should be first or second because that

is the open bar funeral so but that's

where we find what remains of Rosie be

stinger right she's she's fine right in

whoa there's barely anything left that

there won't be much it's two teeth and a

finger

she's fine Jesus what happened look it

says here that the suspects themselves

are going to be at the funeral we don't

want to get there too soon and tip our

hand that's a reason why I'm not going

to alert the city watch about this if

there's too many guards they're gonna

get spooked and get out of there what if

we just dropped Todd what if we didn't

not back to this I walk out the door all

right where are you going we're going to

the tavern first okay yes well yeah well

go to the both of the singing singing

sword - singing sword tavern I told the

Chickenfoot coming to watch the kids and

then as I leave I say the shop is closed

protects the house and I arcane lock the

door if you lock them in our cane lock

is important yes please remember this

the door is locked

no one can get in our house is woful

staying with the kid yes yeah do you

need me to like tell Chris Perkins the

doors lock if Chris is watching the door

is locked

nothing terrible can happen while we're

gone the door's locked

are came locked yeah all those tunnels

that come in and out of the house

totally blocked up yeah and it'll

whatever is already in there is now

stuck in there yeah everything's fine

going on see you guys are making you a

to the singing sword yes yeah that

sounds like a plan by happy coincidence

the singing sword Tavern is actually

located in the Waterdeep market oh good

the northeast side perfect so as you're

making your way there you you see as you

get closer more and more of this sort of

motley crowd all in black all these

mourners you get closer to the market

and the crowd gets thicker and thicker

and thicker and you realize as you get

there that this this funeral there are

hundreds of mourners and they all seem

to be very sincere in in their sadness

the sir these are clearly extended

members of the be stinger family friends

lovers and they are there they're all

extremely sad this seems to this seems

to be like this is this is

place tricks is just each going to each

of them don't worry she'll be back she's

fine

don't worry okay she's dead she's fine

is there even wants to observe if

there's any sort of like traditional bee

sting our family greeting or like

consolation like any sort of whole thing

that they you know like maybe they make

like a little buzzing sound at each

other it's incredibly offensive but give

me a wisdom perception check okay

doesn't know there's no nineteen okay

yeah you you do notice there is a almost

like thieves can't that certain of these

of these bee stingers are communicating

in it seems to be a mix of a particular

set of hand signals that's common to

each and you're you're able to with with

a nineteen you actually can pick up a

few things that people keep saying to

each other you're not sure exactly what

it means but it's something that's

commonly exchanged she just wants the

equivalent of like a peace peace with

you

right like is there anything like that

it appears that there might be that the

thing that you're observing very well

could be that exact thing it also could

be I'm gonna kill you as soon as this

funeral is over but she's totally doing

it though just going on you trying to

comfort them wonderful she's fine it's

work it's working

actually yeah a lot of people they they

I don't know if they know who evylyn is

but you came in with Strix and it may

know whose tricks all people acting

weird around me would not yet okay okay

would it be possible to kind of discern

based off conversations between others

even possibly people coming up his

tricks to kind of ascertain how rosie

was killed it's a you know what give me

an intelligence investigation check

again if you do some eavesdropping ii

that's another 24 boy alright you are

able to eavesdrop on several

conversations and actually insert

yourself into them and the common thread

as you move through is that no one seems

to know every time you enter a new

conversation they

signed a new cause of death to Rosie

nobody nobody is has a consensus on how

she died

are they most day like very violent but

like all of what are some of the causes

he here is like what are the rumors what

poison obviously is a good one some kind

of magical explosion we have those a lot

you have yeah you guys know all about

this

a feral owl bear attack no that wasn't a

night

Kanaya in these conversations be like I

heard it's ultimately because of omen

[Laughter]

dude I heard that too yeah they're known

for survey with thing I wanted it to be

a room yeah just really just like a

dangerous person to work for

not a good ideas here it's so much yeah

like you hate to see it I'm gonna ask it

for a Christmas deception check on that

one because that's a lie like why do I

get to do that to why are you lying with

him on earth I'm saying yes okay yes

give me a group check you said deception

yeah lying I'm not I know you're not

lying is a half group check oh don't

worry you've got Paulson lying with you

but no that's fair what'd you get - yes

five okay hold up and it's look so so

basically I was like I heard omen did it

so 23mm i-5 and a 23 that's like a 28

that is that is a lot like a 28 so then

what happens is DF you are wide eyed and

squeaky voice like but your backup of

him is so convincing that it completely

like people are like no he didn't and

then you're like no I heard he did

and that that really sells it now you

guys have started to crushed and

surprised it's difficult to say it is

that's all it's crushing that's even

comes up to them with a tear in her eye

[Laughter]

it's it's crushing I know but you know

sometimes you just have to believe

things you hear and move on with your

life do I see this guy I want to mention

that you guys are spreading these rumors

about omen while you have the four top

suspects like on your person none of

them are great this is good I understand

he's my boss okay so you make your way

into this singing sword Tavern it too is

full of mourners but there's an air of

joviality still sort of like a gallows

humor there's a there is a sort of a

boisterous crowd that has gathered in

the corner and you hear you hear the

loud sort of boastful claims coming from

a crowd of people and it sounds a little

something like this I am in Diigo and

there is no one who can outdrink me oh

not in a visible and not in any other

I'm in Diego

I'm having a dingy go to reception

because that's alive Alton hears this

he's just like I hear that no one can

outdrink you who is this who is this

newcomer he doesn't know who he is you

don't know who pops up is only the most

famous musician in Waterdeep yeah dude

like I guess I get like free valet man

it's

they sing me a song man Bolton SEPA oh

I'm off the clock by yes I understand

I too am off the clock perhaps you will

learn more of this later ah but no we

can learn more about this now what are

you on the clock I cannot tell you

unless you best mean and drinking

conduct maybe I think they murder Hey

he's like mid drink of his own wine just

like oh yeah sure let's go

it just puts down his like what are we

what are we drinking we are we are

drinking the water deep fire ale oh it's

very strong and very dangerous are you

sure pots and SEPA that you can best

indie go I'm down to going on some some

bottom shelf ale I'm yes there's nothing

thought himself about anything here but

you owe all three of the other

characters are blue

I'm going to try I I've talked to you

for like 20 seconds where did I do

contest you've you offered a challenge

it's as its called psychological warfare

I don't whatever let's just this just

yeah this stuff down there the one

that's clearly not on the bottom shelf

as he's pointing to the bottom shelf

that stuff it's on the bottom stuffs

because this is it is so powerful it's

very heavy to lift it kinda well you're

very strong I am the strongest in the

land mmm all right so you guys are gonna

have a little drinking contest cool all

that's going on death will be basically

working the entire like perimeter of the

tavern if there's an upper area he'll

like walk the steps and like get that to

like look down and around to observe

this guy along with any possible

individuals who are playing like a

closed almost bodyguard like attention

to give me a wisdom perception check Oh

21 jeez Louise what did you actually

roll a six I have a minimum twenty-one

great what you notice is there are

there's nothing weird going on with the

people around but there's something

about the way instructor in IndyGo is

holding his body like he is he is always

he always has his back sort of toward a

particular bookshelf in the tavern

mmm-hmm okay I don't act on this

information at the moment but I've

retained it

evylyn is used to acting as Paul tunes

like promoter whenever he plays a show

so she just immediately goes into

promoter mode and she's like recruiting

people to his team like did you hear

Paul himself is having a drinking

contest against this we go go check it

out take some pictures post them on you

know maybe which stream it whatever you

want she's like going around and

grabbing people to like be on his team

and hopefully aid his charisma and

intimidate in deke oh I like that okay

I feel like Strix is just frozen at this

conflict it's just it's people if people

keep coming up to you and being like

she's fine

she's super dead okay so we're gonna do

a Constitution saving throw contest okay

and I want you to go first okay

does your aura apply to this yes thank

God my aura which gives him +5 to saving

throws nice so even just standing next

to in life and hope you don't die okay

1900 no okay so you both take a swig

indigo says IndyGo it feels nothing from

the scale this fighter Yale has no

effect

well Paulin feels nothing from anything

all the time I'm a shell of a human help

me it sounds like you are losing all

right again

again another drink 13 okay you bet you

win I got an 11 okay no we're one-to-one

this is gonna be the tiebreaker okay

ready hey I'd listen I mean I just want

to say that you're coming at me and

saying that like I've got maybe I'm

gonna cry or do it and I just you know

what I had you just you got you got a

really nice face

have a very nice face thank you what do

you think this mustache I

it looks very fake but how is that

unbelievable I get that all this yes

it's unbelievable is the word for it yes

it is a word that I used and I should I

very much regret saying the main thing

about you that I said earlier I

shouldn't

and I want you to know that no matter

who wins this drinking contest I will

confide a very strong secret to you Oh

so let us drink one more time my friends

that sounds good Colten SEPA all right

what's your phone down I was trying to

look for call your mom okay

dirty twenty I got that's a six okay so

um by the time you finish this drinking

contest indigo is suing on his feet but

the counterpart of that is that you have

a new best friend

we've go so far back yeah I feel like

I've known you for a minute

the secret lair secret lair what was in

the secret lair that he took you to that

you didn't take us with you oh yeah oh

my god

how much do I remember him secretly all

of it okay all of it it was all in there

everything Wow I know I always wanted to

go to a secret lair that had everything

in it it was pretty great I was

definitely the right character to

entrust with important interesting did

you find any clues in there yeah no wait

you did I did

what was it Paulson what was it indeed

do you think the ëthe wrote it down it

was you can think back to your time with

Indy go and the memories that you made

together

and the one thing that stands out to you

is that he said something about Rosie

booking passage on a ship right

captained by Rear Admiral ketchup yeah

the the Admirals realer

it was mr. ketchup with the knife on the

boat the day before I'm standing at the

window outside just looking in just

waiting this doesn't necessarily

implicate them however it does give us a

potential time in place right we could

talk to him or even potentially find out

the name of this ship and where we could

find a ship to find it additional clues

how far is the temple of saloon a from

here how far is the temple of the temple

of saloon a is also in the market square

oh it's right there you look over to

where Evelyn points and you see a a

beautiful ornate building with a moon I

like a series of moon phases and stars

on either side adorning the top of it I

mean it's no Sun temple but it's alright

what did what did you know about miss

pheasant I don't know she'll find you

I'll wager someone who wrote this was

sassy that's actually spooky it is

spooky gotta hate that yeah I don't like

it well and then we go we must go now

but we should do one more shot for the

road I think this is a wonderful plan

yes my accent is not consistent that

happens man it's the drink yeah that's

it you're just from another planet right

Wow

you do a shot all right are we drinking

roll again I know all right let's do it

all right so that is a 26 mm again you

bested me my friends I only got the 14

nice but it is it is wonderful to drink

with you will and you don't tell anybody

about the secret oh yeah anyone without

the secret lair behind of the bookcase

no don't tell anyone about that secret

lair I won't that's the one I can't tell

them no can I tell them no still no what

about later okay

what about like family I think it's time

for you guys to go what about my son

what he party left

oh right

it's no secret Shh even takes that

moment while he's talking to indigo and

goes out and kind of like takes strix

his arm and she's like do you need to

talk about the loss of your grand dad

well I know that some death can seem

very final she's oh but death is just

walking the path into a new dawn like

Lysander teeth no no let me explain

she's got to be somewhere even better

than here she's she's somewhere she's in

the coffin no no you bring note there

somewhere worship any gods

hell no see she's she's just stuck I

think it's in the wall of like the

screaming faithless or something in the

shadow phone or something terrible I

don't know but we'd go grab her and drag

her out if Lysander wills it I suppose

you can drag anyone out of any screaming

wall that sounds terrifying

sure is let's go okay well let's go to

the temple of saloon a I have bad news

though why there actually isn't a secret

lair she just told me dang it I cursed

or there's something about that bookcase

man I like dreamed it that there was I

think I just really wanted there to be a

secret lair that's okay we I mean we

need to rebuild the entire house we can

oh I mean we just did rebuild the entire

house and now there's a secret lair in

it yeah you know what I realized

I locked the door and place is full of

holes

now if you uh did you want the no

ceiling no cool uh let's please go to

the temple

alright come on priestess boon alright

you head into this temple and as you as

you walk in there seems to be some kind

of magical effect that causes the inside

of the temple to be sort of that that

midnight in a during a full moon

the the gliding inside is is dark and

Google and as you walk in you're greeted

by a halfling who comes to you she's

she's wearing these blue robes that

emanate the same cool blue light and she

has a tiara with the the moon and the

stars across across her her forehead and

she says she turns to you evylyn as

you're leading the way I presume and she

goes welcome meet in the sky my sister

can't be here

the the temple the goddess Shalini

welcomes you oh no there's

and she invites you to bathe in her cool

what oh that's weird

[Laughter]

I'm generally more of a warm light

person but I'm always down for a light

bathing oh one of the nicest things

about saloon a is that you can bathe in

the nude we might need to keep

investigating

no we need to leave oh but before before

something so relaxing and wonderful if

you kill my grandma that's what her gran

was my grandma that's tricks be stinger

if I've ever seen hi other your

priestess crew

I'm priestess Brunei but Brunei okay

wait what this name is ketchup no it's

you know the really is gonna be like a

soup or something like that

oh no that's ketchup well priestess

prune a we're here to talk about your

grandmother

we're just deeply troubled and as you

can see Strix is in mourning I know

she's fine

denial least she's talking in the third

person now you know there's all sorts of

rumors around town I've heard that omen

drawn and I I just I was hoping that you

might be able to tell us anything you

know about what happened to Strix is

dear friend and your dear grandmother Oh

darlin I would just be pleased as punch

to help you out oh you're the sweetest

uh one of the things though that you're

gonna have to do with me all you invite

you to pray to saloon Naomi I'm just

glad we didn't have to get naked

well I mean when you pray to saloon a

isn't nakedness like a help oh really -

pants Oh although I'm looking at y'all

I'm thinking that nudity might really

help your your your devotion to saloon a

oh I know

I want that oh grandma I just think it's

important to respect the customs of

every religion and if that's what saloon

a asks of us in her house then of course

we will participate yeah I'll wait

outside

oh that's fine darlin you can be nude

outside - no you can't right they say

that right you did cool is it is there

like a communal wine type situation Oh

based on the smell of yeah say you've

got enough we can see what we can hook

up for you I mean what I was great

everything I've heard about the temple

of saloon a is there you know like spa

baths essential oils crystal lamps all

that kind of stuff very relaxing it is

very relaxing Our Lady of silver the

moon made you the night white lady and

she who gots she looks down on us all

with love and affection from her night

sky it's all about self-care what wait

outside

yeah or how about just a Boleyn she

likes praying I do like praying oh it's

fine if y'all if you you want to do your

own thing that's fine babe I get out

oh I think it's a great sign when all of

your settings are places that your

players don't want to be I think even if

you don't mind praying with me now one

thing one thing you do have to do in the

house to say Luna is you know honor her

above all other gods Oh we'll see no

honoring her is very important but above

all other gods well he just like sits

down and takes out like popcorn it's

just so very clear this there is no God

above my Fender oh no way I could

possibly yes please come back oh this is

red oh is that red

I mean the morning Lord who brings us a

new dawn every morning every morning

even starts to well up with tears that

she's like he shines down upon us with

his warm embrace so brightly

and in the morning light we are made new

and hope well that something I consider

I would counter that the goddess saloon

a is the the mother of the night and

that she governs the tides and a

mother's love which if not for that if

not for Rosie be Stingers love would any

of us be here oh thanks um well see

here's the thing it aren't exactly that

point as you know the moon shines down

on us at night with its beautiful life

I'll get naked I don't care any butt

[Laughter]

the moon only reflects the light of the

Sun she starts taking pieces off her

robes and without the Sun there would be

no light to reflect the beautiful night

when there would be only chocolate and

your response sounds like it's time for

a pray off one left side it's tastefully

nude though the earth is very much

outside all right I want you to give me

a religion Tech mmm you would think that

my a religion check was higher dude just

checking out that stat real quick once

Strix realizes she doesn't have to pray

she shamefully it's back dress you're

welcome to pray darling no no all right

and she goes back out to D I think it

was nothing happened evylyn lifts her

hands and says oh great morning Lord the

number 15 shines yea upon me and I know

your word will guide me it's a decent

prayer priestess prune a sort of muscles

you out of the way a little bit like oh

she's and she's like just a little

louder than you oh right saloon a your

light bathes me in the coolness and

relief of the non sunshine time

I I am never burned by your light it

never betrays me and I am also at

praying to you at about a 16 people in

rows numbers please I didn't know it was

like this as we know prayer should never

be a competition it should be about what

you bring from your heart to offer to

your God and so with all that is in me I

offer I offer a 13 that's a lucky number

in some cultures Oh

saloon a her whose name rhymes with mine

I'm so pleased the second time to bring

you a 16 oh no and to show you my love

for your undying nighttime life

controlling the tides and making for

soothing rest for us all one more time

let's see what you got I'm gonna play a

little tune Oh what kind of tune I'm

just gonna you know take out my bagpipes

oh it seemed a little loud in here take

out the bagpipes and cast some Bartek

inspiration nice help with that wasn't

that him that day but also didn't your

did you count your aura having this

isn't is it a saving throw this is no

yeah

I was trying which is a D I think 800

might be 10 it might be 10 but say it's

10 what suits it it's a really good song

give me some like lyrics for that I know

it's a bagpipe but I want to hear lyrics

anyway

the lyrics are saloon a approve evens

like although by myself I am weak with

my friends and Lysander on my side I

will always be strong so Lysander shows

up emanates from this prayer priestess

Pranay she she doesn't even bother to

roll she just she is completely overcome

she said I did not know that another God

had so much power I have seen pre-civil

offender before and there nothing like

this and I want you to know that if I

had rolled it would have been a two

Eaglin takes her hand and like cups it

in hers and she's like don't worry

Lysander

accept everyone yeah he accepts all day

like slams the bagpipe except it's all

day when you are ready bathed in the

light of the morning no there to receive

can even roll a conversion check which

is just charisma hell yeah

this has worked before she usually

converts her target yeah let's see this

is just plain charisma which is +5 away

let that lighten son it's like you see

the light channel through evylyn and in

her cup hands there begins to glow a

light and she she looks deep in to prune

a eyes and says well thandor loves you I

was like oh yeah check that out oh I

feel it I feel it she tears her sir no

she's a garbage scow but you know where

you should go is you should go to the

spires in the morning and pray and find

truth I will never leave from that place

ever again I'll see you there on Sunday

I do want to say one thing okay and it's

because I feel a kinship with you now

that we both are followers devotees of

the morning Lord arrays crazy o crazy

all day

quick question is it is nudity alright

oh absolutely okay but I do I didn't

want to tell you something there's a

funeral going on and it's for my dear

beloved departed great-grandmother

bless me stinger and can I tell you

something Co please can I confess can I

open my heart and confess to you

absolutely when we confess to each other

it is as though we are confessing to the

morning Lord and his light shines in

where our sin was where sin was your

very pious I didn't

I got pious all day oh I have heard that

Rosie was actually on her way here to

pray to saloon a garbage God garbage

ready here first and that something

happened to her that she was waylaid on

the way here and I don't know if it has

anything to do with anything but I

really needed somebody to know before I

leave this stupid temple forever well

that's so strange because I had not

thought Rosie to be a pious woman I

didn't either

so what what was she doing I mean maybe

it was the nudity she she did love to me

too she did love to be nude

she also but she she had an affinity for

the Stars I think maybe she had some

kind of personal relationship with

Saloon a or maybe was trying to foster

one which was a waste of her time well

if she were here I would just tell her

that a relationship was Lysander he's

know what I mean

how I do see you at those fires God

weird

evylyn emerges from the temple dusting

yourself off just she leave first we

watch her bust out the door yeah and

Brunei has also disrobed she's bathing

in the morning in that morning light

yeah the garden funeral I got ya

morn at the morning light get away from

my table with the stick just went

outside and stared in I need I need him

here okay so you all are outside do you

share your information it went well

her her first why was she neat I have

something very important to tell you

today the morning Lord accepts another

endure fall okay all right isn't that

lovely

that's all I wanted to tell you it was

the nakedness you find out anything

about Rosie oh yeah we did talk about

Rosie you know she said that Rosie was

on her way here to pray to saloon a on

the day that she died and was somehow

waylaid which I seem to think is very

strange on account I don't think Rosie's

much of the preach now but if she did

Priscilla Nathan saloon I might have her

in whatever celestial realm she's at and

then we can go get her I mean that could

be true late shift but you heard she got

waylaid on the day of her coming to this

temple itself yeah okay so that conflict

with the timeline we heard previously

from indigo right well what if she was

going to she booked passage on the ship

and then she was gonna go pray to saloon

a before she got on the ship I mean you

can do a lot of things in one day that

easy she had to make right with her soul

before she set off on a dangerous

journey hmm as opposed you know if we

could learn anything about ketchups ship

as you guys are having this conversation

Strix uh-huh you notice a kerfuffle

somewhere in the the group of mourners

there there seems to be some movement

some shifting and a tall dark beautiful

woman comes pushing her way out of the

crowd and she sees you and you look like

this she looks exactly like that ice

cream and she starts blushing as you

went to her but she says you are you are

Strix

I can't I can't do Strix bee stinger are

you not why yes oh my you are even more

beautiful parties don't know no no or

beautiful in person then I'm going to

get the sentence oh you can't stop me

grandmother's letters make you out to be

no I hate all of this so my don't watch

this you just know what wrong

she is tall she's gorgeous dark skin

dark hair she's a she's beautiful elf

sides tall boots

natural one is very bad that's a seven

doesn't matter I don't know okay don't

care but yours your insight check

reveals nothing no all right but she is

she has she is giving you her undivided

it I hate it a lot

we're just learners cuz both evylyn and

Paulson aren't either set of strikes

trying to have her attention

she's your your friends are very

annoying but you know they're not do you

know very I have seen I have followed

all of your exploits

you are a infamous you you you have the

the swarm of rats go after loud I do

have that you are the pies Oh Mike I

have sent for your pipes I have bought

your pie really eating your vibe you

didn't come to the are you ashamed of

myself

yes constantly her I know I'm thinking

others don't know hello I am thankful

that you've bought or POTUS but this

sort of praises it for me i we also have

a lovely wine one of the one of the

things that I love about you is your

humility it is one of your most

attractive qualities I think it's more

of like a mental health problem but you

know I'm all I'm saying is that I

appreciate it

but did you kill Rosie

I'm what are you accusing me of I'm just

asking because we can bring her back

don't worry about it like she'll be fine

I just want to know if like you know did

you know it's very good for my she's not

did you screw her

wait did you say very dead I did yes for

real the most dead oh that's more

serious than I thought I'm so sorry for

your loss

I'm not rightfully sorry anyway why

don't you talk to my companions while I

walk away yes we we'd be more than happy

to talk in places but I only have eyes

for you Strix and I have been working on

something I was hoping but that I could

show you ain't your like related I

nothing like blood

it's an adopted family thing hey wait

I'm so scared I am your number one fan I

have done so much practice on them okay

I am a bit of a sorcerer uh-huh and I

have practicing your big swarm of rats

all right and I was wondering if I could

do it and show you yes but I was hoping

if I can do more rats than you Wow and

maybe we could go get the coffee no

ain't nobody can do more rats than

strict yeah she got Roetzel perry oh

yeah Rhett's yeah they're actually

running this one I implore you this is a

waste of your time there's probably 10

rats hidden within 5 feet of you right

now you wouldn't even know it no no this

is water deep that is true yes but their

heights will do that and if you win I

will sit in a coffee shop with you and

not talk and drink a cost that's the

dream that is exactly what I had with

all of my friends with all of your

friends sure that is totally fine

perfect one

alright alright maybe she can make more

rats instead you have I do many rats

okay and if you win uh-huh

I will tell you something that doesn't

fit them a secret all right well then

let's let's call this three rounds of a

rat off huh sure fix my grass okay yeah

all right I need you to give me an

animal handling check anything in that

Wow wait do I maybe I do you see your be

able to handle an animal oh yeah let's

see I don't think I do

this is funny that all of these things

are like things you would think our

characters would be really good at but

the actual skill that we have in it is

pretty low

like your khan is actually pretty low

4os horrible my religion check for a

paladin is pretty low yeah it's pretty

weird how that all worked out that's

okay that's nice okay so you do your

swarm of Rodney you make nine rats all

right I usually get more rats than this

but okay he's nervous I am very proud

being conjurer via spell yeah they're

turning into rats okay so it's Matt so

it's a spell it's a spell okay boy okay

anyway oh I have made 10 rat

counterspell

[Laughter]

two more rats up here I have my divine

soul sorcerer ability to where I can

change the fate of a roll and add a

default did you add them to your roll

okay so now I know okay

so a soup assume mine half so as soon as

her ten rats up here it's like two more

two more rat we're gonna get this secret

basically you you are very gifted

sorcerer these bats say then the rats

ate out of each of their ten mouths I

see we go again fine more you go rats

rats straights you don't need to hold

back

that's fifteen rats oh that's quite a

bit the rats oh I have made 18 rats now

it got counterspell there are no spare

has to be fair there was a potential for

18 rats okay all right I thought this is

the tiebreaker I thought I also was good

at rat so I have practiced much rats man

it's okay stage fright is a thing I

don't know why it's such an else person

if you ever need you know a private you

know audience of practicing your rats to

get used to it then you know please by

all means you know I'm like 20 here this

is great for it is great it's great for

you but not so much for me well you know

you say that all right I just rolled and

I got eight rats ate rats oh I will roll

for more rats than you I have got 14

rats no counterspell

I've got zero rats again I am very

nervous in the company of my favorite

person strips basting all right I'm very

sorry this is very embarrassing here's

the thing I'm sorry for being so rude I

just have social anxiety and I don't

know what your motives are and they

frightened me my motives are only

admiration and perhaps see that's the

one I have a problem with oh I didn't

know well you have won fair and square

and I will

one thing that all right there's no

cheating involved at all I don't know

why I have a problem with it here's here

I'm just scared all the time I want you

to know this is something that I know

about our grandmother our dearly

departed grandmother she's fine

she is so dead very sad

extra-strength dead but i intercepted a

message from instructor india who has

this same accent it's very weird who he

had warned grandmother that the

priestesses of saloon a where were

dangerous in some way but they are he

accused them of being a lycanthrope and

that she she needed to find a way to

protect herself well I can what if we

just converted one to Lysander that

would make for a very strange werewolf

hmm do you think he maybe should have

sensed evil on that person before you

like sent them dude I'm sure that she's

just gonna be a fine little son wolf now

we've had werewolf problems in the past

in fact she was one one it wasn't so bad

I've heard good things all right well

that doesn't help us at all no one if it

was the saloon a priest then she aspires

now well if it was but Indy goats didn't

say that and Diigo said that she was

taking a ship with a drone ketchup yeah

we need to check on captain ketchup

that's weird Rear Admiral ketchup

ketchup

yeah rear kappa kappa no its rear it's

important that it's a rear this

importance happen of the rear if you if

you did want to talk to us more about

your grandmother and you know just talk

about her life or have that coffee we

would we would all love to hang out with

you anytime that makes them very happy

uh one thing i wanted to make sure you

know I also run a small business it's a

local entrepreneur here we go it's not

the multi-level marketing scheme but

it's a it's sort of a one level market

of course of course huh and she opens

her like awesome pirate jacket and there

are scrolls on the inside she says if

any of you now I know you have most

powerful sorceress - oh yes of course

but if ever you need other spells I have

spell scrolls and you can buy that they

are single-use and they are very

powerful huh do you have any fun ones

what do you recommend what's hot this

week everything in hazelnut I don't I

don't have hazelnut I have have a good

polymorph if you're a new kind of thing

I've seen Strix to that but I've never

been able to do that I'll go to be able

to do that yeah we need we need to

discuss the budget really first oh it's

okay how much does it cost

um each one is because you have been so

kind to me is even we 1000 gold thisis

only a thousand

to repair I feel like you know because

we are in the presence of the Great's

tricks that I mentioned you see you have

number one are you adopting my accent I

just think that perhaps we could work

out some kind of maybe friend deal where

oh he's very famous and like the the

infamous waffle crew with this famous

strict set of course Walton SEPA he

could you know logo on a switch stream

right exactly and so you provide one of

these Scrolls to us and then we pay back

with this this currency we started using

that people really seem to love we're

working title but we're calling it

exposure and I think that would be great

and can I like persuades for free go for

it

okay cool first suasion sounds like it

sorry exposure sounds like it's more

vega priestess if saloon AP right don't

business tricks is worst okay where oh

there we go okay long time she had to

her grandma's dead she's in denial and

she was a hit on by someone so it's her

wednesday a nineteen persuasion and

she's died hmm I like your Moxie quite a

bit I don't know about this exposure I

don't like to be exposed but I don't

know about this Moxie I got tested the

other days

[Laughter]

okay you're you're very clever

individual so for you 900 gold pieces

you've talked me into it

Oh guys is going to kill me what are you

gonna do boss yeah it was sort of a a

joke I'm the boss okay all right

don't kill yourself that's not the

answer

you know what I won't thank you huh well

it's been fun should we go yeah captain

ketchup ketchup we'll keep in touch did

we need any Scrolls oh we will keep him

and if you just want to get coffee no

please I would love that

yay we have a wonderful wonderful tap

room in our house this is one of the

exploded floors or different call it

call it higher ceilings she doesn't want

to come over to our old place we can

just go grab coffee together sometime

you mean is

will you bring strict feasting or with

you of course my best friend yes I have

so much that she could teach me about

being a sorcerer just groaning over

there making a rat well when she's

feeling better but loss of her

grandmother mm-hmm devastating her much

I'm sad

the denial I am very sad this is how I

express my said Miss I tried to do

business hit on me so relatable in its

I'm very emotionally compromised her

that I will agree with well thank you

very much bye all right captain ketchup

let's use what we know it was him she

was so pretty it was her she did it on

what grounds you believe that what what

what what female Waterdeep that will not

act on my advances

you know I need to have a talk about

what also it's very strange to find

someone attracted to me so I think there

might be that's dream there I think it's

a little weird look here's what we know

indigo was saying that she booked

passage on Admiral ketchups Rear Admiral

ketchups ship we're captain ketchup yeah

one day before the supposed murder but

then the day that Rosie got here she was

supposedly on her way to the temple

saloon eight but got waylaid and we also

know that indigo sent Rosie a message

saying that the priestesses are the

templates lunate could potentially beat

lycanthropes which is probably why she

went there not to pray she's probably

just in his he flings that's why or

weird thing for teeth links so far all

of this adds up ship she was waylaid

chances are she heard they were

werewolves and then changed her mind or

fine went off to find a way to defend

herself the point is like so far one

story kind of adds up maybe she's into

weird smells

yeah every time I Rosie Europe no no

never mind

Strix just got got hit on a little bit

she's just processed you what well there

was just you know that beautiful woman

that just came up and talked to us I was

black gorgeous woman just okay she's

gorgeous

I didn't notice she only had eyes for

Strix didn't didn't see him I think

because she has something you know she's

into smelly tea flings I think that's

like a stiff don't you think that cific

plenty of things to love about strict

Sharia our best if divine rear-admiral

kiss fine somewhere at this funeral you

know that's a lie

I've seen you don't you dare think of

this all right

we're running out of time oh we're

always running out of time no we've

still got an hour and eight minutes

deaath walks away from Moses

conversation they're gonna follow and

basically since he's supposedly

presiding over this funeral he's trying

his best to find someone who looks like

rear-admiral

catch up here what is a Rear Admiral or

even like I guess can I talk to the

Admiral and try to use it to kind of

locate him and or if they had anything

about a ship or any sort of like ledger

that would like record his trades and or

ports that he's recently visited I want

all this information geez very intense

okay you don't have to look very hard

when you start asking about the Rear

Admiral the

[Laughter]

[Laughter]

[Applause]

quality content near the coffin which is

displayed at the eastern end of the

market you know they're surrounded by

mourners and various people who are

clutching their bosoms and wailing over

Rosie's coffin you see directly behind

it a very imposing half work who is who

is standing at attention and he's

wearing his dress military garb his

regalia all his finest his medals are

sparkling on his chest he has ribbons

and he he looks rough is it an open

casket or no no it's an open bar hey

it's not an open casket okay all right

well I'll you guys follow if you want

but I want to approach the Admiral all

right I will I will watch from a

strategic vantage point at the open

right where can you find you yeah so

there's a there's a bar smart look for

anyone not drinking ah yes very smart I

will do that I will go to the bar

you can get anything you want oh come

back to me okay yeah I want to approach

the Admiral and I don't know a proper

salute for him or anything but you know

do my best just be like I cannot

recommend that course of action like

Admiral ketchup I'd strict laughs a

little sorry I'm my deepest condolences

thank you for arranging all of this on

such short notice

hmm short notice

interesting choice of words and he looks

down at you Oh from his about seven feet

tall you're pulling from the bar just he

he gives you a once-over and turns away

takes out his pipe starts to smoke it

bubbles come out hits him with her staff

whoa

good so can you keep a leash on that

infernal singer she's mourning her

grandmother show some respect

this this Bank you mean yeah we would

appreciate if you showed her the same

respect that you yourself have been

given I I apologize see you Strix be

Cyrano get your bartender to learn what

a dark and stormy is good lord

I do all this myself bones just behind

he's he's feeling very anxious and he

starts puffing on the pipe and more

bubbles are coming out and he he he

straightens up and he says restricts I'm

I'm very sorry for our collective loss

oh she's so dead Oh seems what the

collective losses so you know Rosie

yourself in Oh Rosie Rosie I'm both

pleased and heartbroken to admit is my

own adopted mother I'm so sorry for your

loss

thank you also you do me more credit

than I deserve

I am only a Rear Admiral ketchup even

giggles you should learn to be a little

bit more respectful to people just say

everyone is worthy of the same respect

yes and one of the things that all of us

have been doing with Strix has been

actually talking about you know the last

time we saw Rosie and I would love to

hear the last time you saw Rosie it

would mean a lot to districts for sure

but all of us definitely why on earth

should i confide such memories and one

so diminutive as you even starts popping

his bubbles because you can say anything

around my family as you can say anything

you're on the bee stairs yeah I don't

see a single medal on your bosom young

man show him your medal

do it do it do it I was like well for

Wordsworth I am a remember the city

O'Rear admirable that's for sure oh I'm

not guarantee I'm not what did you just

say she was saying I am known as Captain

Diaz Woodrow I know it's not Rear

Admiral but the captain is still a rank

of Honor and I'm saying he's captain but

we love him just the same either way

helping or hurting evil in that's the

theme

can I try and intimidate real absolutely

okay absolutely you can try to

intimidate this giant half horse okay

oh yeah till my sick my staff like right

probably at his like bottom of his chest

because he's probably very tall and I'm

just like listen smack we need

information to find out what happened to

Rosie's so that we can either a avenge

her death which she's not dead so it's

fine or be find her she's very dead

20700 scary goodness gracious

at the 1908 the rear Admirals jaw kind

of trembles and you see his his tusks

move in his lower jaw and he says wool

strips beasting I had no idea you were

so rude it's very frightening

this is much easier than being hit on oh

he's scared now very frightening indeed

well I am frightened of you but I'm not

frightened of your small friend if you

say that again I'm gonna make You real

frightened he's gonna be Hokage what is

Hokage I do I know none of us know now

he says things all the time I think I

think he's I think he's got a brain

tumor maybe even grabs like puts her

hand on DEA's shoulder and she's like

you can speak for yourself you do this

yeah thank you I'm far from diminutive

of real only we're trying to share

memories this is supposed to be a time

of memories and honor and I feel you've

done nothing but dishonor me so I'm

gonna ask you to please let's just turn

it a notch down focus on why we're here

hmm there's one way you could impress me

what you have heart young man but do you

have the strengths of mind on or off how

do you measure honor I mean can I hit

him again that's all right I have a

contest in mind I would use your contest

are you familiar with the game of dragon

chess am i familiar with the game of

dragon generality 26 you're not of

course I am

[Laughter]

this is Dee this is Captain death work

water David champion of dragon chess can

I help him out

yeah please okay what is shouting yeah

what is your opinion what deception yeah

all right girl you like advantage or I

mean oh yeah I mean if he's 1823 you

want to take that role yeah I mean that

ain't the rule but that's a good role

you wanna do it the man invented the

game there's three there's three moves

named after him

really yes you know what I'm willing I'm

willing to bet he could beat you with

one hand tied behind his back yeah silly

it's just chess so you only need one

hand and his eyes closed well that's a

challenge that I would be proud to

accept

got you buddy they totally believe

you're good at this

yes I can rise to the challenge and

defeat you okay I'll play you a little

song it'll help bring bring bring bring

would it be uncouth for me to turn into

a cloud and go into Rosie's coffin yes

yes out of character

anyway it could be something you thought

up at the beginning of the games tricks

that we would have to do coffin is cloud

proof yeah they're like yeah spec she's

gonna try and get in here oh yeah oh

yeah

Rosie's last wheel was make sure this is

cloud proof yeah strict so try and get

in here right

it's the known fact mmm-hmm I just so

happen to have a travel version of this

game here in my back pocket

well that's that's very he gets a

royalty on that probably have your own

set let's see it I did not think it

appropriate to bring it to a funeral

absolutely indeed

we're but the funeral would you be

playing dragon chess you know I I agree

with you Rosie of all people would want

us to throw the down probably also

while being naked even's like got one

shoulder Bolton's got is whatever

concoct is like this is a weird game I'm

just gonna let you all go see how naked

you get isn't giving me done no

thank you they're naked over 0 naked

Halton still in a robe so I mean

[Laughter]

mastered yes I'm excited to watch you

know now we remember you do need to

blindfold yourself

it's only fair for the adventure of

tricks you should give him a token for

luck ripoff a party or your rogue to use

as the blind phone okay I mean that's

what usually doing we need cloth oh

that's right

sure I'll rip off a piece of my robe and

give it right it's like you set it up

like kind of see-through so you can kind

of see in it there's not a whole like

positioned like really like perfectly

where you can see out of it I don't

notice that no thanks yeah okay so

rear-admiral ketchup sets up the board

dragon chest is sort of this 3d chess

situation and I would say just from my

perspective extremely hard to play

blindfolded so it's going to be some

disadvantage on your on your saving

throws here you will have Bartok

inspiration so you can add it d-10 I'm

here because of you you've got back

alright and give him like and you know

what to make it fair I'll give you the

first move that way you can like try to

watch that's very very good

okay we are going to be doing a battle a

contest of intelligence saving throws

just great intelligence yeah saving

throw throws or a skill check baby dress

saving throw so evylyn stands behind yet

with her hand on his shoulder and says I

just can't wait to watch you play and

Paula's got a little loot just like

okay alright so +5 okay

but still a disadvantage oh yeah all

right okay

[Laughter]

disadvantage one okay I think our

bonuses on there it's eight plus your

d-10

that's a whatever so total of sep 15

[Music]

2015

what happens is ketchup takes a good

long look which doesn't make sense

because it's just the opener and he's

like this one it's a terrible move but

you somehow manage to just like dumb

luck your way into an awesome

positioning a perfect mirrored counter

oh yes yes oh yes perfect marry counter

and he he goes oh no human kidding he is

very good this is such bad news for you

this is not going my way roll thank you

your move sir maybe you should be nicer

to people it's like you know we discuss

that afterward okay so he's doing is

this a same same same game yeah okay

we're doing three multiple rounds yeah I

would do multiple matches at the chess

game itself or three roles in one game

of chess do let's call it just like the

moves okay yeah yes and that three moves

is how you finished okay great all right

so after that I'll take I'll put my hand

on whatever the equivalent of the dragon

pieces it's called the dragon something

chest so I find a dragon piece which you

would absolutely know

yep cuz you invented it right right and

then I'm all like but

[Music]

another one that's still 15 I don't know

what you have to roll the d-10 again I

only get that once Oh will you get five

it's a six it's a six all right so

that's a total of 13 okay all right I

don't hate it

as ketchup like makes his move I kinda

lean it just like he's pulling with you

he's messing with your head

are you know yeah

certainly not you wouldn't how can he

you can't even see it's he's that guy he

doesn't need his eyes to see you know

you can take this if you want but if you

do beat him that would just be a a petty

victory under your belt I don't know if

you really want to take that just just a

thought so yeah that sucked

yay but it's still a 14 no it's a very

good move on my part of a bad move on

your part haha Admiral please if you've

seen combat at all all you known is you

barely kept up and then just goes to

making a move oh all right may I perhaps

sleight-of-hand certain pieces

yeah just slowly advantageous positions

sure okay face that we get from Chris

when we wear him down - it took you 90

minutes

is this like to take away the

disadvantage

yes obey say that guy's arm that wasn't

so BJ's I'm like reaching from one piece

I like actually like pick up another one

moving over it's like a diagonal spot

just enough to give me a slight

advantage okay

23 yeah that worked yeah

and then I make my move okay that's a

counteract Kim thanks a lot Hey still

disadvantaged intelligence all right be

with evil ins or ah still classified

it'll be 16 okay that's the best I've

done so far

one more time as it's like going over

it's just like you know yes if a loss to

the creator of Dragon chess is actually

very noble way to go down and it might

actually look as ER as a Rear Admiral

which I've which you seem to be I don't

know maybe maybe that can get you the

honor to escalate to Admiral just by

throwing the game just a thought

and then SDS moving he's like we call we

call this moves the the Woodrow keylock

[Laughter]

to use the key lock on me do you know

what that's a devastating it is a

devastating roof my goodness I I do

people have died over that wars are

started over that mu it's so kind it's

abandoned in most of water D yeah it's

not here though this is an official

competition this is these are street

rules I would very much like to ascend

to Admiral so that people would stop

making but captain Joe yes I suppose it

would be good but my honor demands that

I must try to win what you get 16 yeah

it's better than my rule for sure yeah

yeah yeah I got a six so ketchup makes

one last move in dragon chess but he the

because of the Woodrow key lock he

doesn't have a lot of moves that are

right yeah obviously and that the

Woodrow the Woodrow key lock long being

known as kind of a game ender he does

his best and he says wow it's it's all I

could do it at least I lose with some

amount of dignity with the most dignity

people would pay an arm and a leg and a

nut to to lose to what kind of nut

[Applause]

I'm going to pass up the fact that the

but captain loves nuts it doesn't sound

like you pass it up at all sounds like

you said fair enough

you fought nobly his blindfold that was

an excellent match Admiral I have not

had worthy opponent like that in ever

really yes uh-huh

incredible beggars belief really

so ketchup looks you up and down and he

says one thing that I know about a man

who can play dragon chess is that he is

a strategic thinker and though you bear

few metals if any probably none bad it's

bad it's bad it's not a medal it's not

the same thing fair petals are hidden

the medals of maybe inside you know in

your

[Laughter]

sorry Holden I'm trying sorry you're

doing today don't get a lot but take it

take a moment take me I think that you

make in many ways a magnificent leader

of this band of miscreants what clap

louder and I did I have one piece of I

don't know what to call it information

or a rumor that I think might be helpful

to you of our dear Rosie our dear Rosie

departed for real definite no totally

not that part said depart far too taken

far too late actually there was a

sighting the day that she died that she

had from somewhere for some reason she

was on her way to the temple of saloon

II and she had purchased a spell scroll

of protection from evil and good but the

rumor is that upon using it it had

backfired that it was corrupted in some

way and I don't I have I'm not even sure

that's useful but it's the only thing

I've heard that has the vestige of truth

because she always did think I had huh

terrible is terrible to hear just

terrible so strange you mentioned buying

a scroll we just rated someone selling

Scrolls

what do you mean who well this this

tricks holds up them this lady miss

pheasant mm-hmm in the market with a

spell scroll

[Applause]

yes Oh whoo that payoff gave me tingles

cake I think it was miss pheasant in the

market with a spell scroll impossible

she was she was the most devoted do you

have an envelope we can open with her

face in it well you have I don't know

why you'd need it on in my hands but

perhaps she's someone you should talk to

my Scrolls Barry over price what's the

price that seems like a love for scroll

that's too much was very very interested

in trying to sell one she was very

interested in trying to sell one to me

and also well no talk too much no she

wanted you dead ah I knew it the

beautiful ones are always I will tell

you there's no way she thought I was

attractive Strix I will tell you one

thing and this has been going around

this whole funeral but but it has it has

been true throughout the bee sting or

network for some time that it was a

Homans fault yeah we might have started

that rumor sorry we didn't start it

I don't I don't care about omen fare

you're you are and were Rosie's last

adoption before she departed us far too

soon or too late depending on your

perspective

I know it's used then you were also the

most powerful of all of us I don't know

that's true you you have the reputation

of being the most magical no that's nice

and if anyone were to take up the mantle

of this family it would have been you oh

well that's very sweet but I don't I

don't think I deserve that also it comes

with a lot of baggage

yes very much baggage it's not a good

it's not a good place to be but that was

the rumor interesting so you think that

this present lady wanted to take down

strict so that she could lead the bro

finger clan

I have to I have to tell you that's

incredibly she just likes to do it just

let her have this anyway should we go

find miss pheasant and yeah it works you

know magic I think it's time we go buy a

scroll okay killer thank you so much

hack your Admiral ketchup for everything

for the game guys we gotta go Oh Rear

Admiral ketchup stands up straight and

he gives you an incredibly crisp so I

give my not as good one baby but before

we go I say we Admiral if you ever get

yourself another ship I thought of a

name for it

Heinz I hate you

[Laughter]

but that's very good yes you watch how

you speak to the inventor of dragon

chess all right

let's move before he more troubles

caused we'll head back towards the

market that we saw miss pheasant very

recently and she had a very distinct

look about her and she's still trying to

peddle her wares and shouldn't be that

hard to go find her can we see her in

the marketplace oh yeah I mean she's

still waving its tricks every time Strix

cast her eyes in that direction

perfect Strix we need you to get her

attention we have enough money circus

starts taking her clothes off

I thought what she wanted I'm dipping

into our emergency funds I'm going to

purchase a scroll okay you get that get

it up make it a spell that you know know

very very well I want you to read that

scroll as hard as possible it would look

like that scroll would backfire and

potentially harm someone all right then

we have our suspect that's a genius much

smarter than what I was going to do

which is just walk up and hit her right

and I'll and I'll work on the back-up

plan D F do you still have that rag that

you use as a blindfold yes fine oh no be

right back I'm gonna go to the bar oh no

[Laughter]

can i snag a bottle of something

preferably like very high proof give me

Dexter a sliding hand check you have

magic because Molotov cocktail Strix

nice kick magic yes you can

i-21 god help me wait oh wait no no

sorry 22 oh it's a 22 yes then you get

it yes okay alright well I postponed by

door yes it rather deep fire ale hi I'm

the bottom shelf it was foreshadowing so

I walk up to Miss pheasant in the worst

way that you've ever seen anyone try to

be flirty in your entire life do we say

that yes she's just trying trying she

thinks this is what she wants so she's

just like killing it it is working

oh great she starts blushing

tremendously

I then Oh God scroll during this week we

had planned that you went your wits

tricks problems at the bar preparing a

multiple and I'm basically oh it's a

drought as cover to kind of get kind of

behind her out of sight so if I need to

like sneak up behind her I can't okay

is this like is what's like the nearest

roof to where they're going you want to

eat it from a roof there's a roof really

close by I might just like dimension

door up there do it it's like alright

Strix is now showing off parts of her

body that are not erotic at all like her

arm like what'd he look like

nice you're doing great tricks beasting

or what what has come what has changed

don't you just want to give her a scroll

about it yeah I do if you want disk

rolling you guys girl you and if those

elbows are so nice

oh goodness I can lick my elbow you try

is very is highly a role okay which

which one do you want

I would like fireball please who I do

have a scroll of fire perfect and knit

this year and they give it to you okay

thank you that's enough

just a little it was enough just to be

close to you yeah I run away but strict

stay here I want to see that scroll I'm

never talking to her I've never seen

this girl of fireball a little girl the

fireball and I would love to see it

wasn't strict licking her elbow so

amazing okay fine I run back yeah okay

evenly fine I looking so teach me about

it okay look at all the pieces on it

check this rule oh yeah I want to try

and subtly get their attention from

above the roof just like your friend is

waving at you from okay what was the

signal you CDSs go 20k look for that oh

all right yeah you are able to read this

spell scroll and you realize if someone

read this out loud then it would

backfire and blow them up instead holy

 I said it would be intentional Oh

No okay don't know I don't say this I

don't cuz I know everyone's gonna do

that

so I roll it up and I put it in my robe

and I continue to act normal I said I'll

be right back and I go over to D F and I

say it was her what do you want me to do

in polymorph or no don't look at him

don't look at him

don't look at him

we need it don't get involved after she

sold Anita Rosie if she can carry if she

can say that then that's why were

sitting our culprit

should I show mo el temor elbow such a

nice girl Rosie were to love did you

ever sell one - Rosie say something like

that

that's smart okay they run back up and

they say I'm still talking to her trying

to keep her there like like so did did

did you ever sell on me this is a great

scroll by the way it's very very

powerful magic tricks do you like it yes

so glad and you made these yourself

right I did

yes did you ever sell any to our late

grandmother why I mean it's I mean if it

is a nice girl then she would have

wanted one right I just feel like it if

you wanted to keep her safe you would

have given her one like you gave it to

me

give me a I'm looking really sad I want

to I think I think you're deceiving so

give me a deception check damn it

[Applause]

now

[Laughter]

I am trying to aid her can she have

advantage because I'm trying to be like

oh yes of course you would give it a

scroll you know I that up it

isn't that one you're right okay

pheasant is on - you know she

immediately knows what you're trying to

do she says so what if I did so what if

I gave her well she was old it was her

time huh why is it some kind of signal

okay

Yvonne sees the signal and dives with

strikes to the ground with a flint no

dexterity check please okay I'm we can't

just like destroy this person who

anything forever not with that attitude

[Applause]

that and our other phrases are available

in stop by booth

so what was it Dex yeah oh right that's

another 22 it works

yeah and he did he kind of like he turns

his back to the alley looks directly at

whatever camera and just got even flying

through the air with strict all right

crowd away from alia oh oh come on

oh man what is it about Kate Welch what

indeed

six okay ten - okay

this is initiative yes it is six okay

Wow we all did higher yeah can we level

you huh yes definitely yes okay okay

as the Molotov cocktail my eyes down and

explodes in the market square pheasant

yeah you did that proud of you

pheasant that's hold on okay looks she

she takes an immense amount of damage

which we will calculate in a moment but

most notably she growls and she says

this is how it's going to be yeah and

her visage of this beautiful elven woman

falls away and what is actually there

now is a an enormous demon yes it looks

at it looks a bit like a a fiendish

Minotaur more than 20 feet tall standing

in the middle of the Market Square this

makes more sense so you're saying she

gets hotter yeah nice and she looks she

looks at you strict and she goes I still

think we should get that coffee sometime

it's more sense now and and that is her

turn she takes I don't know 30 damage

yeah sounds good okay okay

Palka you are next okay boy oh boy

can't wait to do this thing that I

definitely have pulled up at this from

your rooftop from the rooftop shouting

okay well that's just all my characters

that's really good

okay I'm going to I don't know I guess

probably I want to like jump down wait

how how high up is this roof 15 feet Hey

so he's taller than the roof oh yeah

oh cool those heads just up here yeah

all right cool then I'm just gonna hold

my hand out and thunder wave his face

which is a what's the saving throw on

that if someone remembers is that like

seventeen well well it's 20 it's a

constitutional it's knock-back yes um

why are my spells yes magic resistance

so what's the DC 20 nope definitely not

so then that will be very oh let me see

okay

why there's like no spell section which

is really good when you're a spell

caster daddy's huh we're not it's

literally not there which is okay okay

hold up easier than ever with dandy

beyond

I'm just trying to work this mobile site

it's like it's it's okay it came up yay

there we go there we go okay and then it

disappeared all right hold on

there we go okay now I have to say I'm

scrolling down to the level there we go

okay so I'm gonna do this a fifth level

which will be do I believe five no wait

68 is that right

are you can to get a higher level yeah

fifth level yeah yeah 68 cool so oh okay

that's the number 21 22 there's one more

right yeah 25 nice okay 25 points again

and they get knocked back 10 feet so

half their body nice all right 25 okay

she's got mmm no why

all right yeah I would actually like to

allow evylyn to go first all right

evylyn your turn I picture that that

happens like even looks to DES to see

what he's gonna do and yet goes my

favorite thank you she pulls out her new

fancy light fall which he recently had

repaired for her which also she needs to

look up because she is not super used to

it maybe a lot yeah it's a lot okay so

she attacks and rolls o27

which I assume that oh yeah yeah okay

great thanks awesome so she's gonna do

that with let's see oh no one oh wait

actually that's a d-10 may I have your

permission to re-roll with the right die

yes ma'am okay thank you

you're such a benevolent deal

ooh much better okay so that's gonna be

plus four so 12 plus my improved divine

smite which will give me ad 8 which is 4

which is 16 and it also does an extra

2d6 radiant against fiends is this a

fiend oh yeah okay yeah where was I just

at how much damage did I do

16 okay thank you so 18 and 21 and then

she's gonna add also I know she's gonna

you know do her thing with divine smite

on top of that yeah so then she's gonna

add just a little bit so 28 and that's

31 and then I think because it's a fiend

she gets another one on divine Snite so

38 may the light of Lysander's shine

down upon you and lead you to your death

light all day she also gets a I get a

second attack I know

that's like one of the main notes that

Chris left that does not hit she got too

excited by that 38 and kind of was

flourishing the weapon around too much

and put up all right evylyn nope dia yes

so when she changed her form I've been

to this new demonic being in front of us

did her like robes containing all these

Scrolls was kind of like fall to the

ground and just kinda get scattered

about yeah I think her her robes got

split apart yet as she transformed using

this massive demon so yeah the scrolls

are probably at least one or two of them

have survived perfect all right so as

soon as evil is up in there doing her

life all thing flying up and from its

face probably deaath immediately pulls

out gutter and starts printing at the

demon but he's gonna go past where she

transformed and actually you kind of

like jump and like slide past the

scrolls and use my cunning action to use

a sleight of hand to quick pick up one

of these scrolls with me as evidence all

right do you roll for that do you want

me to 25 yeah and then like me they like

get pickup back it's in a sprint and

then leap up to stab gutter who was

engaged with an ally as hard as I

possibly can nice okay so but this is

only one attack okay all right just a

normal attack or do I have advantage

what do you think Oh sweetie you can

have advantage way mantich what's the

first attack is 18 the other one is 25

okay that hits so because it's engaged

the target I have my sneak attack damage

[Laughter]

[Applause]

all right so eight 13 15 17 19 22 23 28

that's that's a good amount

oh geez yeah that hurts love it evens

like a yeah and you also got what are

the spell scrolls yeah yes okay that's

my turn okay Strix

um I am you know I showed elbow for this

so I'm I'm just really you know I feel

very so I'm just going to seventh level

lightning bolt just like right in the

face okay do my hold on my phone because

I don't have enough dice no you're

holding all those days so I can either

roll again as their as their a safe for

like evil seventeen

yeah okay

it's 12 does she saves so but she takes

half damage yeah 76 okay

she's also got resistance to lightning

so she'll take half damage no well crap

cool but there's seven guys and the

amount of damage is a 51 so half of that

half of that growth okay 20 minute looks

really cool mm-hmm it sounds really cool

all right cool

so it is now pheasants turn again oh and

I'm afraid she has her most most of her

interest has been and continues to be on

used to explore whatever yeah like it

you're mad okay so so you're going to as

after you attack her with your lightning

bolt she turns and her her like she's

got this almost like a bat like face

it's a huge mouth giant teeth tiny

little nose and her horns her eyes are

glowing red she says we've got a fact

just like pipe off she's gonna do a

multi attack so she's gonna hit you with

both of her fists and one of her bottom

hooves all right so one of those is

gonna be what's your AC it's really it's

13 yeah it's not 13 so you know it is it

11 Rena I didn't cast mage Arbor 1111

yeah my well I guess I probably wouldn't

be new you're not near when you tall and

I'm up by her head yeah okay so both of

her fists rain down on you pow pow her

hoof comes out from her weird little

like cow leg she cuz she kicks you and I

was a total of 63 points and I'm still

up and I need you to make a DC 21

strength saving throw 21 I can't even

get 21 you could roll a natural 20

that's not you might have Plus 5 from

this I know I'm helping no I do okay I'd

like to use a reaction what is it Thanks

I'd like to if I may use cutting words

to try and cut that attack role okay

what's uh what it would mean words you

say

[Laughter]

[Applause]

[Laughter]

thank you I appreciate that

well it's kind of like contemplating and

all these voices it's going just like

pretty sure she's spoken for and it's

going to be my dad which is a deep and

right yes yes

so whatever the attack role -7 okay so

that's gonna be a 63 minus 756 now do it

oh I meant to the wait let me see it

says damage or attack oh it makes an

attack role okay so the last attack role

was three plus thirteen sixteen so yeah

it would be a ten which does not hit

just barely to 40 points of damage

oh great alright well done sir I'm

Weston yes but you are prone okay I'm

under the hoof and then you just hear it

I'm almost bad so like so like wow so

you're like pinned down and dying and

one hoof misses and palm just like got

you fam falton it is your turn

cool with my spell section now pulled up

I'm going to do do do do do do do do and

there's few things I could do let's

let's try and I'm gonna maybe by a

minute and try and banish her okay so

that is a charisma 20 saving throw okay

and is this um does this have a spell

casting time for is instant a what

like how long the headaches final one

action yeah okay

all right so charisma saving through

like leave is what I say we leave just a

straight-up leave Estrella we've got a

19 nope doesn't make it nope nice okay

read me read me banish all right so you

attempt to send one creature that you

can see within range to another plane of

existence failed save if the target is

native to the plane of existence you're

on you banished the target to a harmless

really appreciate you guys clearing up

that little bit of confusion for me

because listen I knew I knew that person

backfiring was all her which is why I

had a normal spell scroll of protection

from evil and good which protected me

from the spell scroll of protection good

you always have to spell scrolls always

smart if you should if you need help

later I can read them for you to make

sure they're safe though I would

appreciate that very much

I knew you weren't dead you were the

only one every single every single other

one of these chumps was excited they

were trying to they're trying to get the

family and I I know that I know that

that's not an ambition of yours but I

still think that one day this family

would be lucky to be run by you

that cunning or smart shame on

them shame on all of you
