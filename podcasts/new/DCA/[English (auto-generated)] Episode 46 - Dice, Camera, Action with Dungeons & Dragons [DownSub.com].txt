Oh

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action

Susie Azzam yes oh great

oh we're just empty shells okay emotions

empty axle issues some illicit segments

previously in this exciting campaign

heroesx someone else the heroes accepted

a quest from king horn off of the

dwarves of Citadel oddvar and went to

the ancient fire giant forge of iron

slag to find out what the Giants are

doing back there after so many years and

they took some friends with them one of

whom was a representative of Clan bronze

fire named crack dragon sport was

wearing a shiny black suit of armor that

later

evylyn found empty and took or herself

and it proved to be very very useful in

fighting Giants unfortunately she didn't

have it very long it seemed to disappear

from her body and only palton knows why

um hopefully became a sexier for the

characters and it actually was yeah yeah

paltin became separated from the rest of

the group by a wall of stone cast by a

dao an earth genie who had a different

mission in mind him and together they

embarked on a mini quest to find a lost

iron golem and to try to commandeer it

the dow was counting on paul tens all on

whispering abilities to be able to

disable the fire giant override on the

golem to make sure the fire Giants don't

take it over Alton was unable to do that

and tried to use his magic to damage the

override and instead got a face full of

poisonous gas he was saved by the Dow

and later decided it would be best if he

hid inside the golem to prevent further

mutilations and that's where he is

currently and paltin cast a sleep spell

on himself because dream dreams are so

much better than reality

but was awoken after the spell ended

after about a minute and he's now

shaking around inside this contraption

which seems to be entering a what paltin

can hear a large echoing chamber full of

noise and calamity the rest of the party

is in the chamber which is the assembly

hall or what appears to be a giant

Colossus being built here by the fire

Giants well it's only been partially

assembled and is in fact now lying in

pieces on the floor because if you were

here two sessions ago you waffle

fritters the animals caused it to fall

over and shatter one other feature in

this Great Hall is a giant pulsating

adamantine heart which strix identified

as an enormous leap our filet tum' and

if it were to be destroyed somehow the

Colossus would really have no chance of

being animated

that's when evylyn hit upon the idea of

striking it with her glorious axe light

fall and when she did power from the

heart surged through the axe and blew it

into a million pieces leaving evylyn

temporarily at least unarmed there are

also seven fire Giants in the room and

Duke zalto the Lord of the fire Giants

they are searching through the wreckage

looking for Duke's altos pet hellhounds

which were crushed when the Colossus

fell over we ended last session with

Evelyn's axe getting blowed up real good

it is now Duke zalto's turn and you can

see DF & Strix and even he picks up and

clears some large sections of the rubble

and there is some smoke coming off of

the floor you can't see what the smokes

coming from because there is a lot of

rubble around that's much bigger than

you are but then you can sort of see

pieces of what appear to be his dogs

sort of ashen

others of what remains of these

hellhounds and as soon as google tow

realizes that they're dead you see his

soul his shoulders kind of sag and this

weight seems to come over him and his

face just sort of drops and his

expression changes from desperation to

sadness to rage in just a split second

and he begins sister just lifts his head

up and just clenched his teeth and glare

up toward the high gantry's and the

ceiling of this great chamber as if he

can barely contain himself and then he

just lets out a long long exhale um and

just sort of looks around the room

um distantly and he doesn't do anything

else on his turn at this point in time

all three of you can see coming through

a set of open doors to the north two

figures

the first is crack dragon spoon your

dwarven companion you can see he is

fully encased in the suit of armour that

evylyn was wearing not too long ago and

he is standing in front of a ten foot

tall iron construct big burly heavy iron

plated thing with a great iron sword

clutched in one hand and his other

gauntlet just tightened into a fist and

these two armor encased shapes darkened

the doorway and crack looks around and

says there are too many eye fire Giants

I hear

I and then he sort of takes his fist and

pounds the chest of the iron golem

behind him South Oldham and says to

paltin and paltin you can hear a dwarf

outside the armor say you better I

figure out I how to gain control of this

thing I or we will lose it hi

and then he charges

um and crack actually doesn't have any

weapons at the moment uh but he charges

over to you Strix cuz you're running

around in a sort of half Strix half

goblin like form that's right

forgot about tonight he said he runs

over to you and he says I I will do my

best to protect you I but you have to

help

Balt and i figure out how to control

that thing i what can I tell what it is

at all making Arcana check yeah right

now I'm just like you know magic 21 Hey

okay so you know that that is definitely

an iron golem and it looks like an old

one um it's wrought of mostly just heavy

iron and it's powered by an elemental

spirit that's trapped inside of it

during construction um this one you wear

at looks pretty typical of the kind you

know a couple things about iron golems

they do have an unbelievably good armor

they're very very resilient they're as

strong as a fire giant they have tons of

immunities both to spells and ordinary

weapons and they also can absorb fire

and they have well they have the ability

to exhale poison gas true this one sink

currently hostile okay um yeah I guess

all the Praxis it's under my control I

now I but

soon as the fire Giants give it a

command it will have to obey them I got

it

I Strix will just be like all right

Connor boy me where the door is like I

saw look inside all right uh he he's too

far away from the golem now having run

over to you to really give you a good

luck he just says that paltin is in its

chest cavity strikes is like I'm sorry

like boy cake like what it's a long

story I uh uh he just sort of holds up

his fists getting ready to hit whatever

fire giant comes at you all right pretty

much all that he can do and great

next up DF you recall that you were up

against the wall trying to remain unseen

by these giants and you saw as the

Giants were rooting through the wreckage

searching for noobs all those pets that

waffles was about to be exposed you can

see that that giant standing right near

waffles is sort of reaching down to take

a big piece of adamantine up and when he

does and pulls it up in front of him

waffles runs between his legs and you

can see that there is a cranium rat on

waffles head just sort of pointing and a

small little uh mouse sort of just sort

of on sleeping on al bear's back and

they go at the rats behest they go right

to a the the nearest wall and then they

run along the wall about ten feet and

then waffles backs up and slams

headfirst into a great down by the floor

and the great pops off so so help me

Jared you take care of that

Ghana seems like it taking care of

themselves okay you're not sure you're

pretty sure they're not aware of your

presence huh wrong and death it is your

turn

how far away was this great from me

this great from you is about 30 feet not

30 z yep it's a it's a it's it's not a

huge great you'd have to like really

crawl like John McClane through

ventilation chaps to navigate it yeah

I'm sure it would be a tight fit for me

but I want to make my way over there and

there at the very least let uh the

waffle critters be aware of my presence

or maybe they'll smell me or hopefully

see me or something yeah just so good I

don't want them mindlessly you it's not

entirely mindless running through this

complex like at least know where I am

they can try to follow or keep up or I

can hold them or something okay

yes I make my way over there like poke

my head in and like okay make makeup let

me jingle my keys a little bit or

something yeah there's enough ambient

noise what the fire Giants kind of

kicking around the debris from the

Colossus that you don't have to worry

about being heard and you're tucked far

enough back up against one of the Cape

support towers for the bucket chain they

you don't have to worry about being seen

so when you reveal yourself to them they

see you good um then it's kind of

totally back in them this way so come on

back to well this deer they can

certainly come over toward you alright

okay yeah I'm gonna try to like get back

to me so ever I'm gonna be grouped back

up right and yes so you are now grouped

with them yeah you still technically

have an action because you only used

your movement to get there and I'm not

going to say announcing yourself to them

Gus Turing to them lost you um I don't

know if I really have an action yet

that's why you can choose not to do

anything yeah pop I won't do anything

except make sure I've got the animals

ready and then hopefully they're they

know enough are smart enough to follow

me because they know if they follow me

they'll find their mom that is possibly

true uh plural there I appreciate you

okay uh so that's D F strict

you're up next great uh have I made it

to the golem or do I need to do that uh

no you can use an action or not an

action you can use your movement to get

there okay cool I will use my movement

to get there just feel like you do you

just the drawer guy and just make either

a perception or in our connot check to

see if you can figure out how to open

the golems child compartment I will

probably do Arcana 15 it doesn't work

but you you've been told that pollens

inside so right so I will knock open you

hear a clang clang clang clang clang

outside ah oh I also say we've made it

to the end there's booze out here tell

you boys just I'm there

I got your blog right here just like

shaking like something on a robe sounds

like that sounds like drink but it's

probably gross yep

great alright uh so while Strix is doing

that

evylyn you're still flying in the room

it is the fire Giants turn not that Duke

salto but the other fire Giants uh and

you can see now that Duke zalto has

found the pets they're all kind of

looking at him like Oh who's which

one of us is probably gonna get deep

 for this my loss is mad house is

mad and even um you would have been

flying at least 30 feet up to hit the

heart which puts you um just at the edge

of the region fire a giant mist or you

try to hit you it's not the easiest

swing for him safety so uh but Duke

zalto is too angry to even bark orders

at them so they sort of stand paralyzed

but that's when you evil and see coming

out onto one of the iron gantries above

you and above everybody is Duchess brim

scarda and her two children

her daughter here's older and her son

your younger and she comes out and last

time you saw her she was in the kitchen

chasing after you um but then you lost

track of her apparently she took that

time to come upstairs you can see she's

got a big iron scepter in her hand that

she didn't have me and she just taps it

kun kun kun on the gantry and all the

Giants look up at her and then she just

points the scepter at you of course you

know oh that's the trick she's actually

the one in charge and then the other

Giants on the floor pick up scraps of

the Colossus and start to roll them at

you cool yep three of them do one of

them are you are currently not wearing

armor uh-huh so what's your AC with your

dexterity modifier uh 12 hmm I don't

know it'll be 12 okay twelve uh I can

check for you to try a bit twenty-one

that's a thirty whatever number

is impossible to hit do you do all day

are they rare um balloon your armor

class currently is indeed twelve yeah

dear bracers count as armor well Rd

you're not wearing them because you well

I mean that act actually a really good

question Chris cuz when I put on the

armor yeah did I keep on everything I

was wearing underneath because I didn't

take it off I didn't leave it anyway

would still have and let you can't wear

two suits of armor but you could wear

bracers Under Armour because my

bracelets are technically my shield yeah

okay

so then it's don't you would still have

those right so then my armor class is 17

okay alright so the first flying chunk

of debris misses you lyza slams against

the wall the second I don't even notice

it because I'm

still looking at empty hands yes bless

your eyes are a little more blurry than

they were before

right yeah yes so three pieces are

hurled up into the air and all three

pieces miss you one of them comes

dangerously close however missing you

just by one so this sort of twisted

piece of metal almost ring shaped like a

broken ring come spinning up at you

misses you by sheer bad luck and slams

against an iron gantry above your head

and then clatters back down to them

Lysander's protecting me hahaha alright

um the next turn goes to paltin on the

inside you hear the knocking and you

hear Strix talking to you about an in do

I know how to open the door you do cool

I'm gonna open the door yep

so the chest of this thing just sort of

splits in half and peels aside revealing

an interior compartment to you Strix

that's a little bit above your head and

you can see that there's a built-in

brazier heavy iron brazier where this

flame is erupting out of and paltin just

covered in sweat his hair plastered to

his face and he's got all these sort of

odd blemishes all over his face neck and

hands or it looks like he was hit with

some sort of contagion or something uh

uh Oh Chris I totally miscalculated my

okay I don't know if you care about that

er I do why I'm sorry I said 17 because

I was counting my breastplate and brace

but you're saying I didn't I'm not

wearing my breastplate correct so was i

carrying it then uh you would have

packed it away probably so I could put

it on next turn kind of thing I it takes

longer than that to dawn okay well then

without that I only have 15 okay so

eight work no I'm still bad for 14 okay

so actually that's that third one would

have clipped you but I'll get to that

momentarily

great so palton yes you see Strix you

also see the chaos in the room 7 no 8

fire Giants what

and do I notice he's tiny - yeah yeah

he's the shrinky-dinky Simon sized oh

I'm just gonna I can just hop out on my

own right yeah you totally can with your

one-night point I'm just gonna hop out

let's see this like anarchy happening

like ah yeah looks about right I wish

you could stay like this forever would

you like to do anything with your action

or do any further movement as you

certainly have lots more movement and an

action to spend yeah okay I'm just gonna

well I'm gonna ask strict's if she knows

how to fix this and by this I mean this

Moulton

is like no it's permanent selects tricks

you know that this is a very simple and

large reduce spell you can do it

yourself

um it lasts for like a minute I think no

actually I heard that maybe she doesn't

want him to change sizes her answer was

no Chris was a reactionary no you know

yes

what you doing what you said are two

different things all right so question

if I'm smaller huh does that mean my

alcohol tolerance is lower um I'm gonna

say since it's a magical effect no it

wouldn't alter your magical tolerance um

great otherwise you'd be doing it all

the time it's fair yeah yeah you're not

a cheaper drunk now no great okay well I

got nothing

okay so that's palton stern evylyn you

took 15 points of damage from that

flying tea yes just from like being

clipped her giant yeah yeah Oh

that's actually that's that's not bad

it's actually less than average damage

for them I had so just so everyone knows

evylyn is not looking healthy

no AAA she's covered in soup is not

white that's gross

yeah but B uh yeah there's like soft

over soft overcooked bits of something

sticking to parts of her - it's like Lu

uh so when it was my fault exploded yes

we're luck you were left with like the

the blackened haft in your hands so

we're there were there black pieces that

flew everywhere did it just incinerate

uh its flew off in the dazzle of light

that erupted and they sort of went

scattering about the room uh so even

just kind of like that whole time that

metal was flying around and like

chuckling they're like tinkling onto the

floor uh and for that whole time while

the metal was flying around she was just

kind of like completely motionless

little flapping boots flapping but she

was just like like staring at the half

and then as soon as she gets dunked in

the head with the metal she's like I'm

sure with andrel fix it she talks it

back onto her back and then she um

I don't eat look she's not feeling very

good

nope is there any way like the chain

that's holding the heart up is it hooked

on something that she could just kind of

be like loop and drop it or wouldn't

need to be like cut so um there is a rig

on the top of the heart that's kind of

suspending it so the chain comes down

big thick chain comes down off the crane

and then there's this ring shaped rig

that the chain ends with and the CH and

this ring has little hooks that are

hooked into the heart so you could just

sort of now the weight of the heart

makes it difficult but if you could pry

the hooks up you'd release the heart

from the rig that it's hanging from you

know what I mean but there's a scepter

pointing at me and all the fire drones

in the room are going

after me correct and it would

perceivably take longer than one turn to

pry these rights off now an alternative

is if you think you think that you might

be able to fly up to the crane and kick

a release that would cause the winch to

unwind like the weight of the heart like

there's a lock on right on the crane

keeping the heart suspended if you were

to release that lock the crane chain

would just another is that it's a

30-foot drop to the floor no how far

away is the crane oh it's uh about 10

feet away from you so I could easily go

there and have an action yes does it

provoke any attacks of opportunity or

anything nobody's nobody's close enough

to provoke attacks of opportunity or to

gain attacks of opportunity the only

thing you're not sure of is you're not

sure that will break the heart any more

than striking an axe yep this situation

sucks don't have a good idea what to do

um you also know you also know that if

you were up on one of those gantries it

would be a hell of a lot harder to hit

you with three but the lady lady giants

up there she's on a different gantry oh

and there's a gap between there's no

direct connection between there is a

50-foot 60-foot gap between Andrew uh I

don't have time to move action and move

again do I uh you can split your move um

so there's only ten feet away so I could

go kick the thing and then fly up yes

okay that's what I want to do okay make

a strength let extract to try to release

the catch on the ring this is a giant

sized crane with a giant size release

catch so may Lysander smile upon me hmm

17 okay uh that is enough all right so

uh the rest of you see this glowing

pulsating heart just get dropped to the

floor chained and all and as soon as it

hits there is a loud clap crashing sound

you can see energy from the heart also

cracks through the floor creating these

magical

fissures um like the hearts impact

actually damaged and split the floor

cool terrible even yell something like

break stuff and finally gay and one of

the Giants who like the nearest fire

giant to the heart actually takes a few

steps back as this crack sort of appears

between his legs

oh yeah and Doogs also looks even

angrier yeah if that's possible

yeah okay and it's his turn uh so Luke

zalto oh boy um just just by everybody

uh he is going to go rush see Evelyn

Evelyn crack and Strix palton and the

Golem options and actually Strix Bolton

that Oliver behind something and he

can't see them clearly so ha okay so

it's all about evylyn zalto is going to

pick up I'm on a gantry Chris you like

Dan trees yes gantry protect me yeah

well he sees actually when he sees you

on the gantry he is going to move use

all of his move to go to the far end of

the forge and climb a staircase that

leads up to the gantry but evil ends

evil and that puts him by the time he's

done he's about 120 feet away from you

ha so he's climbing up to your level but

he still got a long haul to get to you

good yep uh crack uh waiting for Giants

to come at him realizing none do turns

back to Strix and says well I

I just got him out for self-appointed

paltin tiny Paulsen small tip he looks

gross though I don't know what happened

okay

um he will move back toward you to make

sure that you stay protected well that's

nice of them

the animals are gathered around deaath

and now they will take their turn on D F

Stern so DF what would you like to do um

I saw not they've approached me I'd like

to take the two rodents and gently place

them in making my shirt or empty pouches

or wherever they can comfortably fit

when you pick up the two rodents Jonah /

seems a little heavier than he remember

and and you can see stinky is wounded

there's blood dripping oh no and he sir

his back leg is kind of doing a kind of

weird twitch thing I take a brief moment

okay yes that's my action but I take a

brief moment to give him a tiny bandage

yes you can it would take your action

but yes you can use your action to

bandage up stinky before your stuff is

just real quick just give him that a

bandage wherever it is okay the whole

time he's trying to bite you yeah

the whole time is like it's exactly like

strict

let me make a medicine check or anything

go ahead make a medicine check okay yay

11 okay that's you believe you fastened

the bandage adequately non-aryan right

great uh and then uh is can waffles keep

up with me ah yes Wow but you're also

big and wonky but all right without the

harness you without the harness you

can't really fight while holding her

right okay um oh I'll give like I'll

give waffles like a quick scratch

okay section so this should move to

follow me and then I'll try to start

making my way back towards Strix Krakens

Moulton as stealthily as possible okay

with these animals okay um there are two

ways to go about that you can sort of go

the way that Duke zalta went toward the

bottom south end Forge and avoid most of

the fire Giants or you can go back the

way you came where there's a better

chance of you being seen by the fire

Giants there's also an opening in that

wall that leads to the elevator shaft

mmm you want to go the longer way less

chance of detection or the shorter Rey a

better chance of detection uh basically

you think it will the difference will be

like one term in terms of how long as

you get back to your friends all right

I'll take the slightly longer way then

okay in that case you're sort of running

along the walls underneath the gantry

which now to exalt who is storming on

top of ya all right done Strix here we

go alright so you pull yourself up look

around and the interior you see a bunch

of iron projections and struts and

arcane glyphs on the inside of the golem

all sort of embossed on its surface you

can also see a glyph on the brazier

itself would you recognize as the the

stamp of house bronze fire alright

trance fire that's interesting

yep if you want to make an Arcana check

you can try to ascertain if one of these

runes is some sort of right yes I will

do that just like cracker hands like I

know magic so the rest of you just see

Strix is but hanging out of this iron

golem rags like yeah exactly

at least is not as hot for her because

she's right yes yes I got Restless my

right okay okay you are able to identify

the glyph that you think is not normal

in this kind of construct and you

believe that's the glyph that gives the

fire Giants override control great um

can I

snuff it out or uh

to offer you'd have to kind of scratch

it off with something okay

do I have anything I can do that I think

I do I think I do have a dagger on oh I

wait I have my strength right now - oh

that's right yeah we were - I'm doing

I'm doing alter self so I'll just turn

my hand to the claws okay it's like I'm

just like scratch

yes with your strength you're able to

basically scratch away the less tricks

appropriate way yes I'm just like

they're watching all this like ha ha uh

yes um and you you believe that the the

ruin has been suitably two-faced by the

end of your turn all right cool I'll

just throw my head out and be like I did

it okay or you think you did what I

think I did it

yeah you are fairly confident a

difference there yeah okay

the fire Giants um

Dutchess brim scarda calls down

she's almost directly above you strikes

her Gantry sort of sticks out over your

head all I thought I was also iron golem

destroy them she points at you and

Poulton uh and the Golem just sort of

looks up and gives her a big metal

finger that's the Strix effect sizzly I

know I just touched it a little and then

crack

says yeah dumb giant that golem is mine

to command I was like you what there's

strikes was like it like hanged herself

like so nervous

iron golem slay any points at the other

fire Giants on the floor only didn't

point at us so that's Strix is like

success that's all he can do now the

fires

ants who are on the floor are going to

hurl stuff at Evelyn

she's got cover from the entry there are

a lot of them so you are just absolutely

bombarded evylyn with shards of this

enormous construct it bolts and things

that are twice as big as you are um and

your armor class your cover your cover

you do have cover all right uh and they

are just pounding the crap bits bits of

not only is the debris dangerous because

it's flying at you but as it hits the

wall above your head it tumbles down

onto the gantry threatening to crush you

and you are spared I'm being hit hey

Janice uh Duchess brim scarda pulls

herself up onto the railing of her

gantry and leaps onto the bucket chain

which is halfway between her gantry and

news she's crazy she is crazy uh and uh

she just about misses instead of landing

on the bucket chain she's forced to grab

hold of one of the buckets and hang

there and her big iron scepter goes

clattering onto the floor below good

wall I know I'm almost crushing crack in

the process

oh I hope Diaz sees us it can't be

laughs I would have made it with the

rest of her movement she is able to

basically pull herself around the rim of

the bucket

grab onto another bucket for stability

and she's just kind of trying to swing

over to your gantry to me yeah and you

can see her black dragon scale cloak

brass is sort of billowing out behind

her as she swings over her hair is all

messed up now long orange hair coming

undone around her and you can see she's

just

eat just chomping at the bit to get her

big hands around you again hi how are

the buckets attached to this thing as a

point of interest uh there's essentially

these uh big metal towers that rise up

near the ceiling and then the bucket

chain mechanism sort of hangs down from

them and there are these sort of pulley

system chains that these huge iron

buckets hang from but I mean like is

each bucket there's like links of change

that I don't like giant-sized yes yeah

and then like the handle of the bucket

goes through the link of a chain so they

should melded so it's not like something

I could unhook no no it's not something

that's that easily enough and the chain

is not something that I think my axe

could probably get through right uh

probably not

okay um just wondering yeah so she's

going to try to use her second action to

try to swing over to your gantry uh and

again she doesn't quite hit the mark and

she's forced to just grab hold of the

bottom of the gantry so instead of

landing on the gantry she's now hanging

from it about uh 20 feet away from you

evylyn so she's on one side of you and

Dukes altos coming up on the other side

uh three of the fire Giants come

charging it crack and they bring their

big swords to bear against him and his

armor and he is hit once and when one of

these big swords comes down on top of

him uh he seems to withstand it by

virtue of his armor but he does take

some damage because he's not involved so

and then another one also hits him once

and again the damage from the great

sword striking crack is lessened but

still manages to get through so right

now crack is trying to protect you

palton and you Strix from the fire

Giants Raph and Chris just to like make

sure that we're all on the same page

there is there's no escape route right

now right we're shot in this room by big

doors

there is open doors behind the golem

their stripper there in right further in

to the compound you're not exactly sure

we're back to the kitchen and then to

some other place you haven't been uh

from the gantry that you're standing on

evylyn there is a hallway that leads it

appears to lead back toward the foundry

the place where the molten iron was but

at some distance away you're actually

close enough to that hallway that you

can kind of peer down it and see the

fires from the foundry a long ways away

you could certainly reach that passage

before zalto or Britain's Garda got tea

I'd like you to make a perception check

and not to see it

evylyn notices any other avenues of

escape you know my perception is usually

so good seven the only other thing

you're able to ascertain in this room is

there was the gantry there's AG a tree

that the fire giant kids are now

standing on a trim scarred a recently

abandoned

there's the gantry that you're on and

that dudes Altos on and then there's a

third gantry across from you that has

some cranes on it as well and no

creatures are on that gantry and there

doesn't seem to be any other point of

access for that gantry um so it might be

safer hmm okay it's about 90 feet away

from okay you don't see any other with

your role you don't see any other exits

is this this isn't my turn yet though

right

it is not okay it is paltin stirring

soap Alton you've got a bunch you've got

cracking um uh fighting off three fire

giants in front of you

you're standing next to the golem

districts what do you do that is a great

question you also see the Dutchess

hanging by her fingernails from a gantry

a 20 feet above your head looks like

she's going after evylyn

okay okay and a large iron scepter just

clattered about ten feet away from you

onto the floor all right that all sounds

about right

um I will see here where D is not good

but do I wonder where do ya there well

it's true that after the events in the

FO village you with the F had a little

bit of a falling out mm no the civil war

no no moment um okay do I uh uh can I

see

evylyn yes okay uh if I were to well how

far is she she is 16 feet away from you

okay

so I'm going to uh Graner actually okay

and then this other guy is fighting off

giants in front of us yeah you're oh

yeah this dwarf that um I guess you've

never seen yeah you haven't seen since

he ends up in the actual village

although he's wearing the armor that you

were varying frequently so you can

probably put together to say that this

dwarf is actually the genie or one of

the same what um could I grant Bartok

inspiration to the Golem if the goal was

an ally which currently it is because

it's under prax control then yes good

all right

I'm assuming he's about to mm-hm to mess

things up so I'm like oh alright well

I'm your side for now okay you grant

advantage to the iron golem axel spire

the robot oh yeah yeah so what dude dude

dude you playing a song

yeah yeah it is like um it's very t-pain

it's coming from your tiny voice yeah

yeah pretty much

outstanding I do want to move at all

like move behind the golem or move back

into the hallway or you want to stay in

the room you wanna be under a gantry

here what seems like the location that

would put most distance between me and

the things that want me to die uh back

behind the golem

I will go to there okay yes go him

up you've won you're up uh um okay

twenty feet away is Dutchess fire poop

lady yes and she's hanging from the

gantry

yeah then 120 feet away is the Duke and

he's just storming in your direction so

he's not gonna reach me in one turn you

go way up no and she could reach me next

turn so I could flee also I'm yelling to

my friends right away leave um I'm so

tempted to go stomp on her little

fingers tonight okay oh I want to so bad

ah but I'm not even gonna make it use

that other gantry that was up there I'm

not even gonna make it over there by my

next turn it's 90 feet away right that's

correct you won't make it to the far

gantry this does I'd be just like up in

the air

yep all right finger stomping it is

alright go over I'll try to stomp on the

Giant are the giantess actually not not

even stompy I use tree Bain I try to

chop off her fingers okay so make your

attack because she is prone technically

you have advantage oh and I have two

attacks for two hands yes so I can whack

at me no I'm on top of the game

we're below her yeah yeah show how are

you

not directly okay good they'll be fine

okay first attack is repertoire 23 hit

hahaha gross and I'm going to see I have

my shield so this is not too banded

that's just a d8 do I think that a

Giant's hand needs more than a d8 damage

to let go of a gantry and how big is

this hands as big as me yeah okay so I'm

also gonna do divine smite okay um so

that's for normal damage right and then

one drinks yes plus four so eight thank

you plus to be eight so that's 8 plus 4

is 12 radiant damage eight and twelve is

twenty total yeah okay but I sorry I'm

working off of an old version of my

character sheet so I'm just trying to

make sure that I have everything uh yeah

okay that's good okay so with your first

divine smite chop yes you chop off one

of her fingers and she lets go with that

hand all right

there's no boom and then the other side

yeah come on come on come on big money

levander Oh

advantage do I have advantage have

advantage on bow oh yeah okay so that

one would have only been an 11 I got

this chat thank you okay so that one's

20 hip hooray and this is divine smite

as well so that's going to be 10 damage

to start plus 4 is 14 plus 2 is 16

excellent yes so you cut off a finger

from each hand and blood spurts out and

show I have to make it another check and

she falls so roll she falls 30 feet so

roll 3d6 for me me yep

this is the damage from football I'm

walking where those fingers go tricks No

total of ten okay uh yeah you deal her

just nasty gash wounds and she sort of

screams as she falls and lands with a

loud crash onto the floor below

Lysander bless you I killed Mufasa yeah

so these sort of charcoal colored giant

fingers are kind of twitching on the

gantry they're on the gantry

yeah they sort of flute got cut off and

kind of flew across the gantry a little

ways can I take a bonus action to toss

one two strikes

ah no stretch is like uh yes but

everyone all the Giants are horribly

aghast when the Duchess falls and in

fact damn I'd have one try to catch her

ah

he misses nah he's learned uh yeah I

suddenly realized that she's a little

too probably heavy for him to catch

she's like I don't get yeah okay so she

goes crashing down to the floor and is

no longer on the gantry that's evil ins

turn evil in you technically still have

30 feet of movement left oh okay I will

make for the other gantry I guess okay

can i yeah late lay on hands is a bonus

action we figured it's an action

it's an action don't and I never mind

I'm not gonna do I'm just gonna run yes

I enjoyed the gantry

all right see we get to flutter across

the room drawing the attention of the

Giants several of the Giants below you

or who aren't currently engaged in

combat but it is not their turn it is do

saltos turn uh he is now perched on the

edge of the gantry trying to figure out

what the hell just happened and he sees

his wife lying on the ground below well

and sees you flying away from her now

he's super angry okay uh else can be

pissing off yes

uh he rips one of the stone brazier

bowls out of an alpha on the upper floor

parole said at you like a frisbee

Captain America he's gonna be said

ventures improvised weapon but morning

life uh alright so he rolls a nineteen

even with disadvantage which is gonna be

enough to hit you

fortunately LG's yep and he does a total

of it probably doesn't even matter

yeah he does eighteen points of damage

which is more than you have hit points

remaining uh so he hits you in the air

you're hit by burning coals and this

stone brazier uh from his direction you

merely go falling back and land with a

bone-crunching hut on the floor this is

what sheets Diaz by chance she is eighty

feet away well nevermind and actually

falls kind of amid some of the Colossus

debris so she kind of disappears into

the debris on the floor Anna because you

were at zero hit points when you land

you automatically take one deaths a

failure on him

Oh God and the rest of you can hear this

little oh no I don't like this place

this has been hard on your faith and

your bones

alright the iron golem goes striding

into the fray and begins to duke it out

with one of the fire Giants the crack is

holding off just like yeah yeah and

crack is berating the Giants Heinlein

they don't stand a chance against

dwarven iron see oh and he's got

advantage because he's got inspiration

from you mmm excellent okay uh he hits a

giant twice with his big-ass sword and

does 46 points of damage to the

Wow okay Wow yeah I survived until he's

done yeah uh crack uh will at this point

is he gonna do um he is going to cast a

spell and an earth elemental erupts from

the floor next to him and starts to wail

on one of the fire Giants as well you've

never seen none of you have ever seen

Brack the dwarf summon an earth

elemental closer I'm just like uh uh can

they do that set up some bells in a

mistress yeah

unfortunately the elemental makes

attacks against the giant and is

rebuffed by the Giants heavy plate armor

but and then crack himself uh will say

to you Strix is now he's placed all of

his faith in you Oh

he says we need a fire giant to open

those doors and he looks at the he

points the gigantic doors on the far

side of the Assembly Hall ones that you

think lead outside to the mountain does

it have to be a fire giant Orca says

Cyril he says it has to be a fire giant

and they have to utter the proper

passphrase ah

misterx is upset about that what if I

just look like a smaller version of a

fire giant close to the strengths of one

and then he turns back his attention

toward the Giants who were beating on

his head ah death and the animals you're

making your way along the wall since all

the Giants are currently distracted

nobody's really paying much attention to

you you can see you passed by other

vents other

access point was I able to see eita

landfall yes I have line of sight with

Strix at the moment yes what Strix is

about the same distance away about 80

feet all right actually looking at the

map you're all sort of in a perfect

equilateral triangle you're a blow-up

points pinnacle out wrong yeah yeah each

other all right so then I'm going to

assume that waffles can also see Strix I

was high like cut tap her on the butt so

she keeps making her way to Strix okay

Strix just make a perception check oh

nine okay you haven't noticed um a

feather shape come bounding out of the

shadows in your direction

alright I if we're for the first time

this entire mission break stealth and

I'm going to cunning action - and make

my way out to evil in all right so

you'll be able to get there because you

can use 30 feet of movement 30 feet of

movement the - yeah and then another 20

feet of lead the distance and when I

arrived there she's like imagine like

unconscious and bloodiest plop there

yeah God all right

immediately like kick her up one arm and

take the sealing potion that I have

uncork it and give it to her okay

so roll to d 4 + 2 and that's how many

hit points even gets back whoa 10 I was

so scared like you and the good news is

even that that wipes clean your failure

your des a failure so you'll start with

3 and 3 again Evelyn's eyes flutter open

and immediately filled with tears and

she jumps on Diaz and ugh

it's like her arms and legs wrapped

around him

oh yes she is like a whole lot freakin

lighter without her armor on yeah that's

how I figured I was able to do this yeah

all right she's gonna keep holding on to

him and like nuzzling his neck and like

just loving on him until he kind of like

like relax I'm not paltin we're still

gonna get out of it I realize evil in

that you can't uh squeeze him too

tightly because he's got two little

rodents tucked in his vest

oh I get her to Kyra turn juniper yeah

you can have that you can have a smooth

juniper transition can you do it at this

point

yeah so after like she's awakened me I

can like be like she missed you I

stinky bye to you when you try to subdue

thank you very defensive sting he's a

terrible but I try to give stinky a

little brain scritch oh no he's not

having that I'm supposed to do I think

Jennifer doesn't even wake up I just

like how yeah okay so is Holly where do

you think strict are stinky would go at

this point we stick around with the

after go over juniper he's also a mom

yeah he probably since he's injured

he'll probably just stick with DF okay

probably safer yeah he's gonna move as

little as possible right now okay Strix

you're up all right okay well I'm in

front of this is the golem fighting the

golems left

yeah the Golem is standoff in front of

you now fighting Giants with the dog a

um and Paul since you're still with me

yep but but I sort of pulled back a few

paces behind you into the shadows of the

hallway okay I'm just gonna look at him

and be like do you have any of your

suggestions balls left yep

great we need to get one of these fire

guys to help us was already planning on

it I don't care which one you pick me

neither

I don't know if I can I do like an

assist with that like you know torn

I can throw magic editor yeah um all

right well we're gonna do that

I have the strength but that doesn't

really make a difference if I can't open

it without a password right um and the

hearts on the ground yes the staff

scepter yeah because that's scepter near

me or is it is it too big for me to hold

or well it is certainly too big well

you're you have the strength you think

to be able to lift it currently it's

just awkward because it's gigantic it's

so big

yes do I think it holds any spells or

anything useful that would require you

to go up to it and make it our comment

Jack okay I'm gonna do that because now

paulten knows that we have to use

suggestion maybe we can use that

thirteen uh you can't tell whether or

not it has any magical property you all

right you don't believe so first blush

okay it just seems to be her like I hit

you with a big stick big stale yeah

alright that's not fun that's not as fun

I was excited for you do I see her

fingers come on yeah one of them

probably ended up like falling through

the holes in the gantry and it's out

flopping down onto the floor somewhere

is it moving around probably not anymore

but it would be about 60 feet away from

you no that's too far I don't want to

get that far away from paltin it smells

like a little too big to like put in a

pocket just like hold on I carry this

finger how many fingers did I chop off

I'm gonna say that you probably sheared

off completely like one on each hand and

then probably left a gash in the hand as

well okay alright and the staff does it

look valuable does it look like it's

made out of anything the scepter is just

made out of cold iron okay

well that's boring alright it's fancy

its ornate it's got sort of these

flanged ends it could almost be used as

mace you think but to me it's nothing

it's nothing I can really use arc and

foreboding okay um I'm gonna just stay

by Paulson and we're just gonna work on

trying to get one of these giants to do

what we want them to do alright strix

what's your armor class that's a great

question uh that I am upset to answer

it's twelve okay uh you are struck from

above great

and paltin you see what looks like a

giant tankard a giant flagon a made of

essentially a beaten metal this

clattered down and strike land on top of

strix

top well there that's it tricks you are

you are taken down to zero hit point

again how many times do I need huh and

you're thankful paltin that couldn't you

could have just as easily been the

target but you backed into the hallway

further than she did um great I know I'm

not sure where it came from

well there's this some God angry with

tricks just like dropping things out of

the sky cause I miss Perkins

yeah you would have seen that uh new

gazelle toes son took the flagon and

threw us down from the gantry uh her god

I want to give juice also Oh worst day I

would kill his kids and a you can see

that the daughter after watching that

goes running back off the gantry

probably to get something else to throw

met her brother to throw uh and so he's

out on the gantry by himself

the Giants Duke it out with the golem

now the interesting thing you notice is

as the Giants strike the golem with

their swords they are doing no damage to

it whatsoever

haha sparks are coming off it as they

hit it but it's not suffering any

deterioration uh the wharf however isn't

so lucky his armor is protecting him

from a lot of the damage but he is still

being whittled down slowly but surely

under the giant onslaught and so he

looks back two strikes again patient

glare and just sees this tanker with a

pair of which feet sticking out like

rags the to your face picking out yeah

is waffles now just like smelling a pea

waffles they're like licking goofy yeah

probably like dodged around like through

some giant feet to get to Strix and as

now like you say just sniffing her haha

so chewing on her babe uh so no help

there

Kirk will turn his attention back toward

the Giants were kicking him in the ass

paltin you see Strix underneath the

giant sized tankard uh you love that

tankard by the way it's big enough to

climb into the amount of a lip that

could hold but anyway you don't think

Strix is drinking all the moment okay um

are there are there any fire giants that

aren't particularly engaged in combat so

within range of your suggestion spell

you can see yeah there's there's one

toward the back that isn't fully engaged

in combat yet three are beating up the

dwarf three are beating up the attacking

the construct there's one in the back

okay uh but is he too far to like walk

over to well you could get there alright

can I do okay so these fiery Giants are

they like they're just like very very

fire resistant or are they like

literally fire they they're not made of

fire but you have seen them pick up

molten iron in their bare hands so you

don't think fire has any effect on them

would I be able to like calmly walk over

to him and just like give a little tug

on stance and be like hey down here uh

yeah there's nothing stopping you from

doing that because all the other fire

Giants are occupied and he wasn't

looking at you at the time so yes as

soon as you tug on his K his the the

male bits on his chain armor underneath

his heavy plate armor uh he looks down

straight at you you see his big orange

bristly beard and his yellow teeth and

his hateful eyes just like you see that

a see the iron guy over there

does he understand me uh yes okay cool

like alright so you can't do anything to

that thing I don't know how much you

know

you also can't command it it's gonna

kill you that's gonna suck for you

but you could be the hero of your tribe

open those doors I be rad man I mean you

should have advantage never inspiration

you know you tell or you know if you

just you know want to die I mean I'm a

lone judge cuz you'll be good you won't

care alright he's got to make a saving

throw versus your suggestion spell

correct mmm-hmm

that's a wisdom save for him and uh

world Oh his wisdom save bonus and your

what's their spell save DC uh is plus -

what's - what's your safety see uh I

think 15 okay I can check uh actually

it's sixteen Oh

sixteen thank you okay uh so you cast

the spell um and you you say your words

and he looks at the door and then he

looks down at you and based on his look

you don't think the spell work oh is

that my whole turn ah yes you moved 30

feet to chug on him and then you cast

your spell as an action so yes that is

your whole turn it's like I'll you

too buddy evylyn uh you are you are

conscious again with ten

points I'm still holding on to da yes

and you're kind of amid the wreckage of

the Colossus now so you can't really see

what's going on around you but you can

hear combat I briefly confer with the

ëthe and I'm like I'm trying to distract

them as best I can

you guys have got to get out of here and

then I'll escape - yeah we're working on

that part

and oh go ahead we need to get those

doors opens uh but first off can you

help Strix Oh again I kind of like poke

my head up out of the wreckage and look

around see the little feet sticking out

and I'm like I'm on it and I go straight

for Strix okay so you fly up and then go

over the wreckage or do you run around

the wreckage fly all right as you fly up

above the wreckage you do see Strix

she's there are there's a row of fire

Giants between you and her mmm there

they're fighting the Golem and the dwarf

and one of those actually got palton

raided his feet I just sort of loathe

with a one hand on his armor and his

middle finger extended to the other or

what have you I made a friend so you'd

have to you'd have to either fly around

or through the fire dried Center but you

also see now that you've flown above the

wreckage the Duchess brim scarda getting

to her feet and just sort of clutching

her hands uh and blood running down her

ashen colored or arms and all onto her

garments which is even more of aging ill

gross I will pray to lander for you now

I don't take any to her I've learned

I've learned not to say anything to her

whatsoever I'm gonna go you are um

eighty feet away from Strix I will go

I'll go around the Giants on the paulten

side just in case you need someone to

snag him and run away

on the way through okay all right

so I'm running okay oh I didn't done my

armor yet did I doesn't take a turn that

takes my circle minute that takes yeah

you can't really get it on in combat

okay what I'm gonna try on it I'm gonna

double-check for the breastplate but I'm

pretty sure it's medium armor is gonna

take you it's not a snap-on breastplate

hahaha

so it'll take you five minutes to put

that on I'm not gonna do it I'm just

gonna run okay so you can move 60 feet

which means you won't get restricts this

round but you won't also make yourself

an obvious target cool and you're

actually pretty close to paulten at that

time like you're about ten feet away

from him

just in case he needs me tendrá is a

perfect amount of distance for righty

okay cool uh the Duke goes next uh he's

gonna make a perception check um he's

looking out for you too and he's got

he's high above you okay um hey is

covered in soup so I'm camouflaged haha

right he goes storming along the gantry

moving closer to the battle he's going

to use all of his movement to get as

close to the battle below him as

possible

never once really taking his eyes off of

you he won and that's all he does his

wife she is going to look around go

stumbling through the battlefield uh and

with great agony pull her scepter up

into her damaged hand and she has to use

sort of both of her hands to kind of

brace it yeah and that's all she can do

she's Oliver movement and then the

remainder of her turn to pick up her

scepter and she looks around for

something to smash not even noticing

that Strix is pinned underneath the flag

how fortunate yes it's not gonna hurt

her really bad to try to smash something

with her scepter with probably probably

it's not going to do damage to her I'm

probably say she just has disadvantage

on her attacker

to cope with it they probably wouldn't

damage her anymore she's already taken

but her turn is done and it is cracking

the iron golems turn so I'm just going

to make some attack rolls here do some

damage uh alright uh one of the fire

Giants is looking really really hurt um

after this assault why I reiterate that

to the giant time bomb like I told you

he's just convinced maybe he doesn't

need this fell to work yeah I'm gonna

see if they fire I have to see if the

iron golem recharges its breath weapon

at the end of its round alright um

waffles is over by Strix and just sort

of poking her is he just like it she's

just like eating me now just like well

like if you die without my falafel one

of your boots and dragging one of your

boots away uh great yeah

giving the Buddhist shake fine fine

not taking us all the second east nukes

that you keep in your beautiful ass

there's like a bunch of bones coming at

me exactly then she just starts to gnaw

on those yeah and nobody seen none of

the Giants pay this tiny creature any

mind DF yes you're up great you saw evil

and dart off through the wreckage in the

direction of Strix yeah um I'll do the

same yeah um yeah mostly the same okay I

guess coming a Shinto - in case I want

an extra thing to do

alright uh you with your - we'll be able

to get there okay yeah you won't have

any movement really to do much else or

anything - do you want have any actions

left but um yeah at the very least I can

let you maybe kind of roll the flagon

off of her I would like to do that

please

okay Strix I need you to make a deaf

save of course what always

ah that's not Plus anything is it nope

just a 13 okay that's one success for

you yeah alright uh the fire Giants oh

dear um some of them are going to try to

keep the Golem distracted while the

others whale on the dwarf oh my god

the dwarves gonna get pounded this round

don't care you you are somewhat struck

by just how much of a pounding Rach can

take hmm but he is he is looking quite

hurt himself right now

and at that point

frac looks back once again see Strix is

out of commission can't find paltin

anywhere okay he's dear and says to UDF

we got to get that doors open giant just

say the passphrase

what's the passphrase if I know

Oh Simba you what he says I'm not dying

for you I did everyone else has I'm

sorry conscious I'm thinking that

alright and and he says it's up to you

now to use tricks are to you alright

uh and let's see then shad is asking

about the earth elemental that was some

earth elemental thank you the earth

elemental finishes off that first giant

so one fire giant goes down we did it

you guys yes like we didn't do anything

oh the in pieces busy there's a huge

crash as the giant falls they

first onto the floor heavy armor and all

dropping his iron greatsword beside him

I look at the giant man's like oh oh you

know that guy haha

oh alright let's see DF wetland looks

longingly at the great sword alright how

many times bigger than Elin is the great

sword like five she's like and then

paltin the giant next to you uh he is

going to attempt to grapple you

so make a strength athletics check for

me oh boy wait that's not a savings sir

is the saving girl dang it alright

alright

four alright he easily picks you up in

his gauntlet way tiny you are so tiny so

you're just sort of encased in his hand

at the moment it's like yes yeah regret

this dude so you can't you're like

blinded and restrained while held in his

giant hand but you can still talk oh uh

and then he's got you and he's like

trying to figure out what to do with you

um and so that's an attack action for

him and nothing else yes so he's just

got you in his clutches and it's your

turn paltin cool so when you're grappled

in this way um you are restrained so you

can't like move and run away or anything

but you could use your movement to try

to escape the grapple either through

force of strength which is probably not

the way to go for you or through

dexterity acrobatics it's actually

trying to slip through his fingers uh or

you can choose to stay here cuz you know

it's not the most dangerous place you've

ever been can he still hear me he can

hear you

can he hex you can understand you I can

hear you and understand you you can't

see each other at the moment um but than

that yes sound does pass through

hmm can I uh can I try a persuasion on

him orietta spells yeah very much so

okay can i aid his persuasion at all um

unfortunately you can't well I'm from

the inside well I'm gonna I'm gonna tell

me what you want to say let's put it

that way so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell

them and I'm gonna tell them good we all

die

yeah um-hmm I'm gonna be like all right

all right you got me

that's step one of the plan like and I'm

gonna I'm going to persuade him that

don't worry it's gonna be good

that's gotta be great I'm gonna so I'm

just gonna be like all right cool so you

know the plan and you know that I'm

working with you guys

you got that memo and that our goal is

to get these these little these these

pests out of here right now all you

gotta do is open the door and once we're

out you will be handsomely rewarded oh

yes okay I'm feeling to him greed is

greed all right um make a persuasion

check at disadvantage because he's

hostile Oh true okay well that's an apt

20 okay

well when the chairs we know it's gonna

be hot you know it's gonna be lower than

that come on uh seventeen okay that's

pretty good though is he persuaded uh

can you use your glasses of charming

where the heck is that you had I mean

he'd have to see me yeah a little hard

when he's stuck in a fist um and he

holds you feel him you're moving being

moved around closer to his mouth and he

says to you very quietly

just sayin

tell me more oh I think you know exactly

what reward

hey you're e well yeah you can't hear

anyway but he says to palton I don't

know you know the one that they said was

forbidden is to only be granted to the

most deserving the rest of you kind of

see this one giant standing out of the

battle was fist up to his mouth and

she's like and he said he hold he says

again could you be little precise but

that's all he can do on his turn so you

can think about that uh Evelyn

I want to like I'm I'm you know running

by but I want it I want to take like a

slow motion like resplendent Lysander

moment to turn to him and like in my

most persuasive paladin Oracle voice say

you must listen to the small one in your

hand and persuade the Giant to listen to

politic can I do that so you're gonna

make a persuasion check yeah is this

advantage because the giant is hostile

toward this is where this is where we're

at okay so that would be I actually just

so everyone knows I have a +8 to

persuasion even doesn't use it very

often so that's a 19 or a oh come on

twelve okay I you are not as persuasive

hang at um your your resplendence does

not seem to move him the same way that

hit unadulterated he does alright and he

just looks at you and he says I'll stay

out of my bad do I have more turn uh you

think that's an action but you still

have some movement laughs okay I keep

going towards tricks okay you can get to

her at the end of it okay yeah Cyrus

tricks is lying there the big flagon is

cast off to one side

waffles it chewing on some bone that it

dumped out of a boot I can't lay on

hands though I have to wait till next

turn yeah yeah that's an action okay all

right

Duke salto is making his way up well

he's gotten to the crane and begins to

winch the heart back up I'm basically

pulling it up off the floor that's all

he does his wife walks over takes the

scepter clunks it on the head of the

fire giant holding palton and says Kevin

whereupon the fire giant does exactly

what she commands

pulping it drop onto the floor then she

just sort of pushes him aside takes her

big scepter and brings it down on Alton

price know she has to make an attack

role but at disadvantages her fingers

real mess that's right and also she's

dumb jerk yeah he is a turkey McGuirk

face hey everything had ruined

Alton your armor class is not great not

great uh checking again 15 yeah all

right so this advantage she rolled a

twenty five and a sixteen so she hits

you in the head of a mace and because

you like once you because you have one

hit point you just crunched into four

well I've tried all I can all right I'm

still small right I was just about to

say and at that point in time

crack crack Stern is going to come up

next minute on your spell is going to

expire and you eat normal-sized once

more cool great alright um and so she's

done hurt her son from above pearls a

flagon down on to evil it no fun at all

oh I only Rosa fourteen that's equal to

my armor class oh that's equal I'm sorry

okay uh then he hits you or nine points

of M ha ha take that one yep haha uh and

then his sister goes back to get another

heavy object uh alright but you are

still standing and the family is done

which brings us to

RAK the dwarf he is looking so hurt that

he is changing tactics and no longer

going to hold off the Giants you see him

uh turn into a pile of sand and begin to

shift away across the floor between the

legs of the fire giants and he leaves

his armor behind so this armored shell

is just standing there and then it sort

of falls over and collapses into a heap

and the sand trickles out of it and

scurries off like some sort of Sandy

goos creature

I want that people to know how I know

evylyn sighs get very wide and that

sister and the iron golem will continue

to bash away and does badly wounding a

second another fire giant and then the

earth elemental continues to follow

through on cracks commands and hits that

giant or hits one of the Giants as well

so two of the Giants are looking to the

fire Giants are looking quite hurt of

the ones that haven't fallen yet and it

is d astern yeah if you see evil ones

are sort of reeling a bit from getting

conked on the head with a giant sized

flagon mm-hmm splendid uh so by my

understanding so the door that has to be

open has to be you have as a password to

it but it must be spoken by a fire giant

correct that's what crack said what the

hell do you want me to do dude not

magical but you can unlock stuff it's a

magical er yeah it's like an 80-foot

tall turret ya know bit uh locks I guess

I'll uh retrieve unconscious tricks okay

she's pickup uh also come lumber after

here after you with her boot good

uhh Bolton's unconscious yes mm-hmm

yeah you just saw the weight of the

scepter come down on top of pulp evylyn

can you help Holton yeah

all right that's the kind of confidence

I'd like to hear

Evelyn's like got a black eye and her

nose is bleeding and she's covered in

soup yeah

yes um uh just make a perception check

you got it

22 there are two rates or here neither

your custom seeing them and have had

their great I baited lower ventilation

shafts that have had the great sort of

knocked off uh so you know right so the

door is back leading toward a fire giant

kitchen in right but these grates are

you said we're gonna be tough for me to

get through yeah it's her for a human

even a slight one like you it's it's

it's gonna be tight but you can manage

entry there's no one in here there's no

one in your party so big that they can't

fit in but mind you you have an

unconscious person with ya

and I suppose I could just stuff ER an

event thanks you are I am a healing

potion on me singing oh you do I should

know that you don't know oh you might

know that I don't say I will say you

probably know that yeah all right um

great

okay oh that's something yeah I mean why

not you want to be grossed out and dig

through her rags like that see okay not

a bat flies out of me like my life all

right I'll try to quickly retrieve

strictest healing potion and then give

it to her so she conscious to do strong

stuff yeah look look look look

roll 2 D 4 plus 2 thanks for not pouring

it in my eye is patient from I hope this

one goes just as well

it was meant to be taken up always close

I got 9 nice

ok Strix you're at nine and I think held

up currently by dia thank you

uh-huh I think it's time to go yeah I

agree I agree I have a plan do you do

you know how to get one the Giants open

the door nope

what I have a plan okay well it's tricks

you're up all right I'm gonna turn into

a mammoth all right all right

a a big tossed mammoth gonna polish

myself into a mammoth all right there's

time oh yeah I do that I just don't grab

on I would like to do that please okay

make sure and as I make sure I get

waffles please yeah I'll be sure to do

that

there we go there you go slammed on the

door love it

all right leave awesome so a giant a

giant mammoth materializes does it have

email hair like Strix

yeah it's like all black and tattered

with like messed up hair yeah with like

moths flying around you all technically

still have your um giant strength in

your members form so uh in hermamma in

so in her elf form this is the Polly

more she temporarily gains the mammoths

at points and that's so Rick is actually

greater now yeah oh it's greater and I

have a hundred and twenty six hit points

yes sick awesome importantly all the

time I was saving it but I guess it's

too late now

no but seems like a pretty appropriate

time to visit alright so yes um and

Strix obviously you're not gonna move

yet because you want your friends to

climb aboard yes uh so the fire Giants

go oh gosh

some of them since crack is no longer

there to serve as a bulwark some of them

slip past the iron golems guard and

attack you Strix

mammoths you are a mammoth your AC and

mammoths form is there

which means they can so one of them hit

you once the other one hit you twice so

uh mana you'll want to track these hit

points separately yeah I'll try my

mammoth thing so the first whack on you

does uh twenty six points of slashing

damage alright the second one is 30

points of slashing damn alright and the

third one is 22 slash well what yep

alright so though big sort of bloody

carving swaths through this wooly

mammoth

but yes still got more hit points India

and that's it for the fire Giants and

palton gets to make a death save you can

do its trick ski so let's try my best

oh just straight up t20 roll yup uh-oh

that's a nap 20 outstanding that means

you are conscious with one hit point Wow

yeah getting that good time you've done

that yeah I know it is the only time the

see hole here you're lying there after

being smeared and you look up and the

Duchess is standing above you but not

looking at you you just see her holding

in her bloodied hands the scepter and

trying to gauge the rest of the

battlefield confident that she has

reduced you to pulp I just kind of

continue to play dead yep and evylyn

your turn 9 hit points and there's a

memory next to you uh man I've also

informed you to grab all him yes well

did do I need to cause in my mind

Paulson still unconscious that she's a

mammoth mammoths don't speak so you'd

have to just sort of

make uh well I knew the circus and I

totally nice man

well I'm only ten feet from calton so

I'm gonna grab Carlton fireman carry him

over my shoulder and Duchess sees you do

that well it's my turn

Duchess so her turn is next so I grab

him throw over my shoulder and I gret

jump onto the mammoth okay use my boost

to try to like jump as high as I can aid

me up then I just try to get on grab on

and all right I like throw my body over

what I think is unconscious Politan and

just hang onto the mammoth fur right I'm

just like yes uh Evelyn even there's

still arms and Colton's your confidence

he can't confident even though that

brutal smash she took he could still be

saved

okay good I guess I'll be out like

holding on to stretch with like one hand

and waffles play tucked under the arm

teddy bear in front of me or something

okay

should I roll perception to see if I

noticed that he's not unconscious

anymore

I could tell probably the difference

between an uncut

unless he's really good at pretending to

be a rag doll I dialed my breath it

would be it would be a perception check

against his de sac ting yes I so can can

I just feel like I'm good oh yeah you

could do that yeah yeah exactly like a

sheep lost me down I'm just like thanks

I'm uh dan has blessed you yeah sure

I like have this missus okay Duke zalto

will go next he will maneuver the crane

to swing the heart and send it swinging

down at the mammoth that seems like it's

hard to do like disadvantaged leaper hey

this is a prize weapon I is gonna try to

clobber you with the heart uh but with

your crappy AC um yeah I was actually

going to hit

all right so as soon as the heart

strikes you you hit 39 radiant damage

I'm still alive and as the as it hits

you radiant energy courses through the

Mammoth's body and just sort of blackens

one side of Strix and then the heart

just soar well it's sort of old back

actually it's a fire giant just takes

him clean off his feet yet struck off

there's a flash of radiant energy and

the fire giant just Falls lady one all

don't care his wife comes cutting

through the melee provoking a tax of

opportunity from the elemental hit sir

and as the iron golem which hits her yes

hmm wounding her quite grievously just

to get a chance to take down the mammoth

after taking both the hits from the

elemental and the golem she is still

alive but quite gravely wounded and she

brings that huge scepter up and just

slams it into the mammoths head right it

slides off her girls and she has

disadvantage but even then she rolled in

19 it yet age on the die was her lowest

and she hits the mammoth or 22 points of

damage

well I'm dead now what I was all I had

come on I'm tell there's no I do we can

get out I only have nine hit points left

that was our grand escape so how many

hit points did you have when you took

the 22 Oh me as a mammoth yeah uh nine

okay so you had nine we had nine is a

mammoth left yeah okay so so that means

you're only six damn ready I was going

to run but I didn't get chance to run

yep the Giants little odd

so after your hit any excess damage

that's left over transfers to you well I

was had nine hit points as well yes

so it's so you were taken down

completely

yeah yes okay but not that far all about

go falling off Astrix resist reduced to

her normal form unconscious on I did my

best I guess we'll just meet the gods

now yeah I know whole thing yeah and

actually yeah I'll need

evylyn and paltin to make dexterity and

evil and important to make dexterity

saving not good uh sixteen okay five

five evylyn you took some damage from

the fall but you only have on hit point

I'm unconscious okay evylyn lands hard

and just sort of rolls off of strix

unconscious beside her all to me took no

damage

okay guys you know I've been thinking

about this what maybe we should just die

here alright and DF you were not

technically on the Mammoth's so you

didn't know it all I wasn't okay but

you've got waffles tucked under your arm

and Dutchess brim scarda standing right

in front of you pulling back her mace

for the second swing

she'll bring down on top without me yes

okay

oh she would have pritch you but she

didn't uh on her on her off role she

rolled a fourteen not good enough all

right her iron scepter goes crashing

down onto the floor next to you but you

get out of the way just in time

second attack good round her the fire

giant family her kid will try to drop a

plate on Paul tans head excuse me all

this with the kitchen stuff yes

okay range attack role against palton

palton

that's only a 10 on the attack role so

this big stone plate crashes onto the

floor beside you and splits into a

million pieces

you see I do exalt O son on a gantry

overhead looks like he's alone who just

tried to drop it on you all right and

the iron golem takes down another giant

so three of the fire

three of the seven fire Giants are down

leaving for standing plus the Duchess

and that's important because it's DF

stern the DF you are standing with a

very wavy like bloodied paltin & Waffles

lit up and unconscious evylyn

unconscious tricks the Duchess is right

in front of you and the FI the Golem is

busy fighting off fire giant uh-huh

strength and eland are both unconscious

Bolton might as well be all just next to

me

yeah swinging at me but she looks all

messed up right she has taken a

substantial amount of damage great and

the Duke is looking down on you from a

gantry obviously aware everything all

right so at this point I like just

seeing the devastation that's come to

his party uh deaath loses it uh pulls

out his shorts or it just lets out a

huge scream just ah Oh half for the

Duchess yeah it is going to with waffles

in arm no okay like roffels something so

probably oldest tricks or whatever and

I'll good way to basically quickly scale

up to the Duchess as fast as possible

exactly climbing her yeah I try to get a

blade to her throat or just like right

on top from ready to stab and either

finish her off okay but ideally

have it there and use it to threaten her

along with Dukes I'll don't every other

 fire noises in this place oh so

you're not actually going to wound her

you are going to threaten I'm gonna have

that there so like the moment she tries

to do anything that could just soar to

the throat um okay so since you're

basically trying to run up her on candy

or cutting action - yeah help okay just

make a strength athletics check all

right just spring upon her to hold on to

her basically yeah oops

she's a moving target well stay on oh my

god all right sixteen okay that's enough

oh you're able to get your grip and you

run up to her with your tiny little

knife a short sword you're a little

toothpick sword officer that was 17

because my stone a good luck okay great

whatever all right so uh so I got that

there yeah holding on to her hair or

whatever like and just screaming out as

long as I can't like the rest of

everything I want to tell Tony here I

want the fire dies here everything like

they clearly respect her they clearly

pay attention to everything that she

says and I'll just yell enough a single

movement of this blade she dies it's

over we only wish to leave let us go and

it's over

make a intimidate check Hey very very

very important yeah check okay let's see

her a chat watch Deus ruin everything

done and that's all for tonight

Paul Tain's taking what he anticipates

as his last drink

I really tried with the mana idea it was

a wonderful year 150 hit points

yeah and they disappeared in one turn

yes really I'm

if the dwarf hadn't gone scuttling off

that probably I'm scenario yeah the

other fire Giants came at you and it a

lot of damage before not just it's

Craig's fault yep or whoever he is

whoever he is whatever he is find out I

don't know all right thanks everybody

for a traumatising a couple hours but

next week's episode is actually gonna be

super fun

um Oh grand ol time yeah I think I think

it I think it's gonna be I think it's

gonna be super super awesome and some

unexpected stuff might happen so Oh tune

in to the finale

Holly will be how I survive the

afterlife I think I think the waffle

crew might still have a few surprises

left in it hi I am routinely surprised

this episode by da we managed to not be

dead i yes I'm I - I'm really surprised

at how quickly you guys were able to get

change things around to turn what seemed

like you know well I guess I'm out of

the session for the rest of the session

hey I'm back in the game really cool

stuff

some of us haven't gotten hit oh yeah

yet my favorite thing they saw the chat

was a near the beginning of the game

someone just said just cuz Perkins even

liked the waffle crew Oh at a certain

point I was gonna ask dude if you want

to stop doing this then just gets bored

rocks form all of this is precipitated

by a single incident involving a frog

just remember that it started it started

like four episodes ago when the

who lost the element of surprise and

it's just been off the rails ever since

yeah I've been in the same initiative

role for like the four sessions a long

time yeah but you know what I still feel

like watching that salamander burst out

of that hellhound was worth Italy worth

it yeah pretty cool oh come on this is

great energy I'm actually I'm very

impressive guys ability to stick it out

cuz I thought oh my god you're in a room

with a thousand hit points of fire

Giants I have absolutely no idea what

could go what could go well for you I

mean Chris is saying to himself man I'm

a monster

I haven't I haven't been that like I

actually got to a point where I was like

am I gonna need to come to terms of the

fact that even might die here like I

only have two more death saves and I

have a terrible roller ah so I was very

sad for a minute and then save your DF

I'm like that every time we play yeah

I've been restoring I've been

brainstorming new characters ah yes yeah

you gotta desperately trying to pick up

pieces you guys are in the heart of the

forge though so if things are gonna get

bad this is about as loud as I could

possibly get so well done on a growing a

growing everybody yeah love like yep

everything's fine yes when you're

fighting you know six encounters at once

chameleon gothic when Chris Perkins is
