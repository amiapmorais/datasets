hello welcome to dice camera action a

little DNA game featuring the waffle

crew and today also the awful crew mom

Wow they're evil lesser Kim there's

something suboptimal I guess they would

technically be Kim huh I got a ham here

yeah yeah they were sprung from strands

of hair stolen by night hags

oops no wasn't stolen it was given given

you're right yes it was a gift of hair

to the night hags turned into the awful

crew which consists of evildea who looks

older than normal DF and is just

generally more menacing but a bombastic

dresser he's more full of himself he is

definitely full of himself and he has

got bigger boots and evil palton straud

poseur fair and evil Strix who is a

feral trash pile completely out of

control and last week we saw the awful

crew in Port lions are ooh and they were

running around with a nymph named um pox

with and also a big giant black bag that

they were using to capture evil people

to send to the night hags to be eaten or

to have other nasty things done to them

and they decided to throw a little girl

in the bag

and it turns out she actually was an

evil soul in her and then and then they

made enemies with some dinosaur trainers

and Strix was able to basically mount

the Allosaurus and ride it around until

she went screaming into a marketplace

and started lighting things on fire with

her fire bolt spell then she got knocked

off knocked unconscious and is bleeding

out

she got dragged over by a building but

the party was not able to stabilize her

yet so she has two successes on her

death saves and one failure meanwhile

there is a fracas that played out at a

at pasta mania a restaurant in Port

lions ro where paltin ran afoul of a

waitress named Marsha and a spaghetti

cook named Shmuel Schmo ghen smoke went

down

Marsha had her eye plucked out by the

imp and dropped in Paul tans moonshine

drink and Marsha is still alive

one-eyed inside the restaurant while the

waffle crew convenes around evil Strix

is trash pile body forget anything

thing that happened was palton was

holding Marcia's eye and lanzerath he

squished it yest it in his hand while

she stared with her one remaining eye

yeah okay if I remember correct they're

all in this courtyard outside of this

super hipster like Edison strung

festival lights restaurant called pasta

mania right yeah cool so as Marsha

stares in stunned silence at Paulson's

hand now covered in eyeball goo from

behind her you hear just this slow clap

and from out of the shadows behind her

shoulder you see someone or some thing

kind of shove her out of the way and

step into the light out of the shadows

you couldn't see this person at first

because as you now see kind of the light

fall on them you see that this person is

made entirely of wood and metal and that

that wooden metal is mostly just black

and gold but encrusted in different

places with jewels and fine cloth kind

of draped over one shoulder

and it looks like a human but made of

wood and metal you I don't know if you

guys have ever seen anything like that

before

but she comes out slowly clapping and

and says good show I'm unconscious she

walks up to paltin and she kind of like

looks him up and down raises an eyebrow

looks at DES walked up to him puts one

finger on his bare chest and says the

leader huh well someone's got to do it

and without me they're pretty much

worthless and or dead he looks at back

at strikes like Oh or dying and she kind

of like grabs his nose and and shakes a

little bit and like Chuck's his chin

she's like an aren't you just a hotel

drink is something strong excuse me kill

like cut that the metal hand appendage

away and just be like enough that

clearly you want something want

something well don't we all

I just think that you've you've put on a

good show here today I took notice of

your particular style and I'm intrigued

I must say yes thank you that's right

for once again I did all the work and

you're welcome

she looks back over at the eyeball and

she looks at Marsha and she's like

aren't you gonna finish her off her

[Laughter]

maintaining eye contact with this person

talking to death he'll just reach back

grab a throwing dagger and just throw it

at her world ahead without even looking

I I wanna I I want to say that you can

do that but I guess you have to have

disadvantage if you're not even gonna

look well you know what amazing thing

about awful yeah unlike real beer he

rolls amazingly well I'm not amazing

after bonus 17 even with disadvantage

yes about 15 12 it sticks right into

Marshall what's the damage

also for added flavor it like wishes

like right toward evil Paulding and he's

got six damage all right less you want a

sneak attack it no I can't see got the

road budget they're mine the six okay

Marsha looks like she is not feeling

well at all

but she's still standing Sinatra she's

got I like she's she's bleeding out one

eye and she's holding that now she's got

a dagger in her gut and she he's just

standing there like having been brushed

aside by this construct like you know

she's not she's not gonna do anything

but she's still just she's kind of

standing there rocking back and forth in

shock

yeah just shrugs it's like she'll bleed

out the this stranger kind of looks at

her and kind of nod she's like hmm

that's probably more interesting anyway

what's your name

what are you saying I guess I mean yes

this knows you knows himself as DF so

yeah you just say I'm dear what's it to

you

oh well if you're going to be joining me

as a follower then I certainly need to

know what to call you well we're making

a lot of assumptions aren't we oh well I

mean either you can join me and and

serve me in my quest for glory and death

and darkness or I could just kill you

right here in LA so you're feisty too I

don't ever noticed but I've always made

my own path in life

oh you're just so cute oh she just

pinches your little cheeks she's like

and you tell vampire II and you know

whatever you are what's your name they

call me Mitch

loo app are just palton I guess I

suppose you'll do I'll do what I mean

follow me of course tip well I I don't

I'm sorry I don't really I don't buy

into the whole follow for follow things

so I'm I don't think I'm on board with

that look whatever you're doing with

this bag it's obviously not your own

idea somebody's making you do it so you

can either keep scrounging for people to

put in a bag or you can follow me and

we'll cause some real trouble or I'll

just kill you and that'll be fun too all

very appealing after hearing that DF

does one of these huh I suppose I mean I

want to be employee under those hags all

my life but oh it's hacks is it what

you offering hags are gross righty

I you know hags are gross

whatever that pile of something over

there is is gross you guys are not gross

you're pretty cute and I would let you

be my bodyguards uh-huh and what do we

get out of this

yeah what's what's the hourly on that

well I will let you kill whoever you

want

I will let you every whim um I'll let

you keep whatever I don't want that we

find and I won't kill you I try to

stabilize Strix at some point in the

conversation I'll turn into a rat

because I obviously can't stabilize her

as a raven so maybe I better look as a

rat nope I rolled a three the only the

only person trying to save me can't save

me in the corner no you're just done for

the three-count it's time I guess you

get another that safe though I know yeah

you would get another Jesse I would get

another destiny I have to mean three

successes and I'm done correct yeah that

means your stay

okay so you're stable you're not gonna

believe table now okay I'll just lie

there until you get some no way they

just said everyone hates me it's fine I

don't I don't think most people would

even notice you're there cuz you are

literally hidden behind a barrel in a

heap that looks like trash so that's

where I belong

yeah with a rat perched on your head

yeah I'm sorry to eat me is said rat

hearing this conversation oh yeah

oh he's like nine in the eye over

both of you but thankfully the hags

can't hear they just see right right

okay so far it seems like the stranger

has not noticed that rat with that eye

okay

deaath kind of puts his hand it puts us

like fists onto his hips and Kyle leans

towards a stranger a little bit kind of

divot here the suspicious eye and says

get to keep whatever you don't want

mm-hmm so then you're implying that

there's things around here you that you

do well look at me I mean do you think I

just got all this from from asking real

max yes gold just like you know gold

jewels she's like you know she's made of

precious metals and then on top of that

you look at her and you can't even

conceive of how much all of the wealth

that is in like implanted on her body

could possibly be worth I turn invisible

okay that's all I can do is my action

this round to it I was playing that we

were out of initiative but if you want

to if you guys want to get an initiative

well my plan is to basically just turn

invisible reassume my inform and then

find out where the bag is

okay who's got the bag I believe still

India's possession okay

then I'll go over to DF and whisper in

his ear she does hear that okay

and she just raises one eyebrow and then

tries to she pulls a giant battle-ax off

her back and tries to slash through

where she perceives the sound came from

at disadvantage because she can't see it

but even so she rolls she rolls in 18 oh

yeah that's definitely gonna hit okay so

she does

she does just five damage okay and just

out of curiosity is her axe silver door

magical because that will affect how

much damage I take it is it is not

magical okay so I take two nice it's

good okay if deftly dodges some of my

blood just sort of splatters down on

your shoulder yeah I just got this vest

and it looks real nice on you thank you

it might look even better on the floor

[Laughter]

what was that and how are you going to

kill it

that is the uh that was the hag's little

Lackey thing it's going cotton you are

still unconscious but not dying anybody

got a no killing solve another drink

anybody got any Haley no no no can't say

I do

alright sorry okay

eighteen okay eight for the IMP one for

do I even enroll as an unconscious

person no not until you rejoined nothing

to you essentially you're conscious all

right any more drinks

oh and Marsha too I guess

called poor Marsha okay does she have

does Marsha or this construct with all

the jewels and gold have like openly

marked potions of healing hanging from

them anyway is there a ruling fountain

anywhere within sight no unfortunately

not no let's see

okay and Strix is just unconscious so I

guess she's not in the initiative nope

all right cool

so yes you go first what do you do hmm

just gonna step out of this one cuz it

isn't my problem

sorry basically just kind of uh is

Boxtel on the shoulder he get knocked

off I was just kind of flapping near

your head in my natural form oh okay

okay uh and then yeah just in case he'll

use his cutting action to disengage this

pin just be like all right and then

let's see then next up is this stranger

and Chris if she's gonna try to take

basically a blind swing at where she

still thinks this thing is would

disadvantage be appropriate or is there

anything else just disadvantaged okay

oh no okay wow she's super misses print

misses you're all done at one she looks

incensed especially if DSS embarrassing

she turns blazing he does say that yes

okay great

now Paulette it's your turn what is the

nearest source of alcohol good question

imported moonshine into the street right

Marsha doesn't seem to be in any shape

to serve so I would I would presume that

the nearest alcohol is at the bar inside

you guys are kind of in this like

courtyard okay I'm going to cunningly

make my way to the bar all right I think

that provokes an attack of opportunity

from winder wouldn't it I guess you guys

weren't in melee you were she was kind

of more in melee with you all right so

you you're fine you can you can go into

the bar I did

he's just sees like them going honestly

[Laughter]

all right cool I'm Fox your turn I will

fly up out of reach

okay and followed EF because he has the

bag okay I'll just stay I'll just stay

as close to him as I can without

actually likely okay Marcia fleas okay

she just runs she runs for like the

staff room and barricades herself in the

staff room of the restaurant she's she's

out of here all right that brings it to

death again so am i aware of unboxes

proximity to me you can probably hear my

wings flapping mm-hmm all right I'll

look over ed

knit blew up and I was kind of give him

one of these like uh like I'm not over

towards the stranger and then also kind

of like not in the direction of our um

boxes just be like like what do you

think that one or this one

yeah he's gonna he'll like look at the

two and suddenly subtly just be like I

don't really care what you do

and then just carry on FDS done it goes

all right

yep figured and then he'll pull out his

short-sword and swing it unbox nice all

right roll the hit

I'm assumed at disadvantage cuz he's

still invisible no he's the only one

that try to stabilize yes don't this

vanished

yeah okay ooh that first rolls good

I don't think 10 no 10 no no all right

well then it has a real evil smile as

he's doing it all right next up is a the

stranger who goes for the same general

area that she

swinging for at disadvantage and roles

of 10 no nope nope

hmm she doesn't like that very much

oh and she actually gets two attacks per

turn so she's gonna try again oh and she

rolled to 20s

what disadvantage and I have brand new

dice and I love that oh okay so she

crits much for my revenge talks and she

does this this time you see her kind of

like you there there seems to be this

like symbol on her chest it's a black

disc with like a almost kind of a

glowing purple rim on it and and as you

see her really like rev up for this big

hit with with her battle axe this time

you see that she's she's got it in two

hands or wait does she hold on yes she's

got it in two hands and she kind of

starts to like seep this like purplish

black oil from some of the creases and

then she attacks and let's see how much

damage she does oh my gosh I do not like

the d8 so far it is only rolled once

okay so she does five plus five necrotic

damage okay so I will take ten of that

halved is five mm-hmm sound good yeah

all right I am still alive

all right paltin are you just drinking

um do I have like a general idea of

where he is I mean we're swinging in a

demand nut yeah I just hit him in blood

kind of splattered everywhere so you

he's basically at the end of my battle

axe right now okay and he's still

invisible mm-hmm but I I probably have

an idea of oh I don't know let's say

like a 20 foot cube guess of where okay

cool I'm like taking a drink

he's just

I use calyx I was like I'm gonna cast

fairy fire in that vicinity so he's

highlighted in a nice in a nice green if

we could nice all right I'm all aglow

the green glitters off of the strangers

black metal body and she grins evilly

all right

so that basically neutralizes that

neutralizes my invisibility

so no disadvantage now and okay if I

become visible everybody will have

advantage to hit me so yeah

d/f evil DF yeah where is the bag on you

it's basically really as a carry it was

kind of stuffed on the back of his fash

now like down his pants but like kind of

like the way you would put something

like in your belt got it okay so he

probably will be able to crawl into that

he is

um pox is gonna take to the sky he is

going to disengage flying 80 feet up and

away oh damn

only any of us could fly all right I've

reached and that brings us back to dia

not quite throwing a dagger all right no

disadvantage no advantage just straight

up

so just a d20 yeah okay

and as I throw it yells we quit yeah

[Laughter]

it's still gonna be half damage cuz just

a regular dagger that's right so six

divided by two three damage okay so

three damage yeah okay I only had two

hit points remaining so when your dagger

hits unlocks there's this like this

explosion of diabolical occur in the sky

and bits of goo fall from above and then

the hi guy just goes plop down into the

sand I step on it

[Laughter]

the stranger walks up to let's see

paltin are you still you came back

outside or were you casting that from

like the doorway I was casting that from

like the doorway I still made my way in

okay so you didn't get any of this occur

on you but I think dia that kind of like

rain down on your face or something so

the stranger will walk up to you and

kind of like wipe some of it off with

her finger and taste it mmm

she's like so you've made a choice then

well I could figure we keep doing the

same every day and just collecting

souls for who knows what or if you have

to know where some perhaps valuables are

then maybe I'm more intrigued well you

know I'm always uh keeping an eye out

for the latest fashions and the most

valuable trinket so I'm certain we can

find you a little something you like as

long as you help me in my quest to

[Music]

spread the darkness and death yeah

whatever it is that you want so long as

I get some stuff out of it well just

swear fealty to char and we'll be on our

way then oh sure char is rad very good

she walks over to paltin uh char

opinions show what now char swear your

loyalty fealty I won't kill you we can

go in search of you know hold on hold on

she looks at the earth he's the slow one

isn't he no I have something for this

just give me char thing yeah let's go

let's go with that sure sounds good to

me

um one more thing if you can give a walk

over to the pile of Strix and just be

like can you get this one up oh that's a

that's a somewhat yeah thing doesn't

need a lot of food doesn't want a lot of

stuff but has a lot of arcane powers

that will definitely be helpful in us

acquiring ah strength above all as I

always say and she lays on hands for 20

hit points on Strix what does she do

does she spring up she springs up in a

meal he tries to bite whoever

resurrected her the stranger allows you

to try to bite her and it's just it's

cute yeah sometimes all right well now

let's go and you know rule with an iron

fist douse the flame of hope and start a

new adventure shall we yeah unless death

will take the bag that he's been

carrying for collecting Souls and he'll

feel like hold it up to Strix and just

be like scorch it she's like yes it's my

destiny do it on fire

and I was like drop it let him drop it

and let it burn inside the tavern so

it's just a fire hazard

alright and that's where the awful crew

will stop all right oh no but they're

still alive

against all odds yeah

[Applause]

j/k evil paulten kills himself whoa okay

so back in the hags lair Strix and DF

and paltin you are all now yourselves

and one last we dealt with the hags you

were cutting a deal with them the three

for three deal you would give you each

of you would give a piece of yourselves

hair clippings whatever to the hags for

their ill use and in exchange they will

give you three things and when last we

dealt with them you basically decided

that the three things were going to be

mr. Fox's spectacles the spell book that

he stole from shemekka and a

resurrection scroll yes yeah

the hags are about to talk when suddenly

appearing in the cauldron there's like a

tinny thump sound and then a little girl

kind of pokes her head up out of the

cauldron and the hags quickly sort of

circle around the cauldron and kind of

pull her out and holding one of this

girl's limbs like one's got her by a leg

not to others got it by the arm and

they're just sort of sniffing her and

kind of tasting her okay no no tricks

just runs as like this one's this one's

no good I can already tell she's tainted

what nonsense

no no she's super good can't you tell

maybe we shouldn't eat happened maybe we

should make her into one of us yes like

no far too young

no absolutely not I don't know what

where this where she came from but

practically worthless waste of your time

don't why does she worth to you

constricts just like make AI isn't

paltin India like this is gonna go bad

like worse what worth to be what do you

mean if you want to have a hand in her

fate will let you you can have her but

we want something in return

if you don't want her then we will do

with her as we please we want we want

her is that what we're doing I hope I

don't want her to die or whatever it is

that they're going to do to her oh yeah

we can't do that up I'm gonna I'm gonna

be like I'm gonna try and persuade them

I'm gonna be like like like she's

worthless to you she's worthless to us

she's worthless in general she's barely

worth she's not even worth the time

we've spent talking about her so why

don't we just carry on with our that's

now glowering at you her face all

scrunched up in a frown I'm just like

yeah see this is what I'm talking about

it's kids are like ruined already

it's a horrible I need to persuade okay

so you're basically just trying to get

them to what let her go yep yeah that

would be a fourteen okay they sort of go

off and huddle a little bit five feet

away and they like I don't think that's

a good idea at all why are we listening

to him because I'm handsome he's

handsome

hey as they're huddling could I possibly

polymorph one of them oh you could try

we still need their things

my god I have a plan it's fine don't you

worry all right

good uh just make saving throw

she is magic resistance so she has

advantage on her save damnit

what's your DC sixteen alright so there

are three that you can choose from

there's one who's got the coins on her

eyes

there's one and like the ants crawling

on her skin there's the one of the

string necklace of chattering children's

teeth and the peg leg and and when she

sneezes or like blows her nose or

something gas comes out of her ears and

then there's one of the bag over her

head which has the Viper the cockerel

material Pro Terrier poking out of it

alright I'll do the bat I'll do baggy

alright um the spell cast upon her and

you can what are you trying to change

her into you by the way

Oh a chicken of course okay you can see

for an instant like a couple like

feathers spring out of her arms and

stuff but then she's like no no no no no

and she fights it off alright as that

happens I go clearly the child has magic

go ahead and make deception Jack should

learn the ways of magic you would love

to adopt her into your coven would you

not oh wow okay 22

okay very persuasive you can see that

they'll turn on each other and then the

one with the bag on her head just sort

of holds out a clawed hand and puts the

girl to sleep and the girl just sort of

falls over and is now lying sleeping on

the ground and then the bag woman the

the Terrier starts barking

and what and the one of the coins over

her eyes says that would be enough

trouble from you Missy - the little girl

lying unconscious on the floor worked

yes yeah you sure showed her no she

knows magic clearly this is a powerful

little girl

yeah they definitely showed her so those

three things are you sure those are the

three things you want yes effective

strict cymbalta psych we're doing this

right we don't really have a choice we

need to bring evil and back that's kind

of all we have right and and whatever

deal we make with them can not be worse

than suffering whatever wrath zamesca

could bring us that's a fair point

because she's really scary Mishka

oh please don't no no huh nothing

nothing the hags will huddle again he

said hmm uh no that's that already kind

of okay well I was saying she meant ska

her favorite music oh we were talking

about the little girl once we came when

she messed up is what we said and one of

them will say yes her spell book van is

it yeah yes that's why she sent you

after mr. Fox correct

and for his spectacles too and because

he has a sword that he puts keys in but

I don't understand no no go on

need-to-know basis Starks is like

covering around like over-shared

yes enough distractions do we get the

items now right uh yes yes

all right the ones the things the one of

the coins are on her eyes says points to

the one of the peg leg and says Peggy

you have the spectacles in the book then

she points the want the bag on its head

and says Norma

that's the scroll I will keep our guests

company well that's nice I bet she

reaches down she grabs the little girl

by the foot and just sort of drags her

across the lab all right throws her in a

throws her in the chicken coop that

girl's very powerful be careful I've got

my eye on her no you should teach her

the ways of magic she looks at you and

and by the way at this point the other

two

you see they become ghosts of their

former selves and they just sort of walk

off in different directions and go

through the walls strict anybody who

wants to can make a Arkana check I will

do that hold on I forgot my dice okay oh

okay

24 you believe that they have gone

ethereal they've entered the ethereal

plane and wandered off all right I will

tell this to everyone and say they've

become ghosty people I'm sure that's

fine

I gathered that yeah and after they

leave and the one remaining hag says so

deity she comes up to you Strix what

Kevin do you belong to

yeah Chickenfoot coven Kevin and where

are your sisters in the very wild why so

far away from them I'm on a quest of

course you are we have a soul

and she pulls she pulls out a spool of

red thread and a pair of scissors snip

stretch pulls out her scissors Toombs

like puts her scissors away and pulls

the needle out of her hair

stitch stitch I don't have a needle so

I'm just gonna keep being like snip snip

and she'll show the ravenclaw and be

like see that is not a chicken foot well

I don't have one right now all right

look I make do with what I can get okay

sort of looks at you won't fully you've

heard of Baba Yaga though right

oh yes yeah she was my teacher my

grandma was she and I like looks kind of

proud but also scared and just like

please don't kill me and then you can

see that something else goes cthugga

thump inside the cauldron and the hag

reaches in and pulls out the body of a

dead man who's missing a hand actually

now the invention it's weird one of his

hands got chopped off all right and she

says problem he's clones and nothing but

a disappointment I'm sorry the what

mm-hmm

what Chickenfoot says what she says

we'll make new ones get rid of those

defects DF what kind of interrupts and

say if you have these spectacles and a

book what's so important about them we

don't have that yet daddy all right but

so but would you happen to know why

someone would want these so badly well

if you are working for a mascot

working against mr. Fox you've stepped

into a bit of a Oh Kenneth rivalry oh is

that bad

think that's bad that sounds that sounds

bad is it bad very alike those two

I wouldn't want either of them is my

enemy

okay but you happen to know why they are

warring with each other because all that

catalyst want is magic and knowledge and

they'll take it wherever they can get it

oh okay and how would you if you were to

say we're going to halt stop defeat or

kill on our kana lap how would you go

about it

um you see her go over to some ratty old

scrolls and dig one out and she says now

kennel off is a kind of youghal affair I

like fiendish mercenaries they will work

for themselves or whoever has enough

zinc to keep them happy I know that word

oh you're so good like she says I came a

lobster powerful spell casters as

powerful as any Archmage individually

but like all fiends they have their

vulnerabilities if you know their true

name you can make them do things against

them

wait are you saying that shamash gay

isn't your true name mr. Parkinson is

really neither of those names are their

true means our names can I do an hour

can I check on that absolutely one I

want to bring on my dice roller

it's 24 again yes yeah you know that

with a 24 actually pertaining to you

Galatz in particular that they come from

a place a plane called Gehenna and that

there are these books known as the books

of keeping that contain all of the names

the true names of every youghal off is

inscribed in these books so we can find

out your name yes and so yoga lofts hate

being controlled in this manner and

they're not shy about making their

displeasure known and like a petulant

child one will follow its instructions

to the letter while looking for

opportunities to misinterpret them but

if you can figure out that you go lost

true name you can basically tell it to

do whatever you want it to do Arcana

lofts because they're they know great

magic are a specifically wizard magic

are very very dangerously powerful spell

casters their magic resistant and they

have also innate spell casting abilities

like the ability to magically teleported

will huh huh interesting

circus we'll just look at that

the hag would be like do you know any of

their true names I might know what I do

oh but I'm not going to share them would

you share them for what do you want to

trade for something what do you have

aaaaagh I'm afraid it will cost a good

deal more than a hug dear what do I have

Strix that seemed like a hefty price but

it'll help we're doing it alone enemy of

an arcane Olaf for no reason

certainly not for a hug what about maybe

just forget it for now

it's fine well cross that bridge when we

get there one problem the hits fight

remember you have all even stuff -

that's true

what about like the pieces of light fall

or something like that no are you

kidding me I'm not giving that up what

about like an arm I don't need that all

no good absolutely not you need that to

cast spells I have this one what is

light for nothing Strix no it's it's a

magic axe I have um four candles what do

they do what do they do

well you see she Olga with them if you

are in a place that is not quite lit

when the club is real lame these will

help you with that and more like see

with your eyes not your hands you see

you see her kind of reach out for it but

she doesn't touch it she just sort of

puts her hand her fingers all kind of

around it but doesn't actually touch it

you think there's something weird going

on there Paulding linked you sense that

she couldn't touch it even if she wanted

to simply because you told her not to

like there's some oral metaphysical

barrier to her touch

somebody else's things without their

permission notice almost like they're

repelled interested and but she studies

it and she says it looks like an

ordinary candle does it light under

water or but no I didn't say anything

like that it's it absolutely does it

lights under water does it illuminate

invisible texts yes very much so and it

can even be used in magic darkness does

the flame sing dark songs can you make

it thing I mean if you like ask it if my

eight could she tries sing candle well

it's not your candle it's not gonna sing

for you show me how it works it's more

rewarding if you learn yet has never

facepalm so hardness fault falls just

like I mean if you don't want the candle

that's fine I'll just you know put it

away save it for someone it's very nice

but it's not true name nice that's not

worth the price of a true name oh yeah

what would be worth a true name to you

it's very tempting but she says I would

like she sort of looks around make sure

nobody else can hear her

and she says I would like you to carry a

child no goodbye I'm what like what like

like where - like transporting like

where white throat - Strix is belly

new sister dear there's like almost

arm in front of struct at this point

choice no strikes we're not doing that

that wait does it seem like that is a

lie make a bow sorry in sight check was

the mincing I thought that she wanted

paulten to carry the child and I thought

that was really interesting that's a

five okay you can't tell where all do

you want to do i all do wanted to see if

skirts can actually tell if they're if

they're talking about saving them from

the ark analogues oh wow that's a I

guess like a 21 okay um you think that

she you can't you don't think she's

lying you think that she

you think that it is typical hag

behavior only to promise what you can

actually deliver and you don't believe

she's acting in a way out of accordance

with that so she doesn't know I mean it

wouldn't be wouldn't be for that long

right just a few months mild

inconvenience absolutely no no we

already got enough weird fanfic stuff

going on guys Vince your master would

leave us alone right I'm sure she would

no I think it'd only get worse she'll be

so grateful to have a spell book

returned first of all we've already have

a deal for her spell book and that's all

that matters right now that's the end of

this she's gonna come back for the keys

what keys we all have keys and some

shape or form don't we I have keys but

what are your keys what are these keys

you with had to it's the key to

friendship elaborate he like he like

walks up to her uh-huh and it's like

it's not about physical keys and then

points to like her chest and goes but

the key in there she sort of reaches

down into a gown and pulls out a key

hanging from if it keeps your mask away

I'll do it I don't know you're not doing

anything like that strix please it'll

keep her away no it won't you think

trusting a hag deal I mean my boy right

we're doing the one

that's enough is it really when we have

so much more to offer its tricks we

don't need that

if sabbatical leaves us alone then we do

need that when's the last time Chumash

has really bothered us though every day

I mean first yeah for some of us every

day but me personally I don't have much

quarrel with her if we're being TBH I

don't know what tbh means but I just

want her to go away what can you make

her go away we can facilitate a more

understanding relationship between you

sure sounds like a no that's the end of

its tricks no no it needs to stop

alright well we'll return the items and

then it will stop we'll get her back

everything we she's ever wanted she's

got everything we need all her jewels

mr. Musker are done and they will be

done with her y'all never done what the

king of the cross trade once she sinks

her teeth into you she doesn't let go

huh

absolutely not well it's not your choice

if I'm going to save my friends and yes

but she does say to you she comes over

to you death and she says but maybe

there is a way to discourage her from

troubling you any further what

she says you mentioned the keys to these

keys fit into a sword perhaps how did

she know Bolton so you're him the hell's

that mean she's the one still dislike

like likes cuddle up next to while

they're saying there's been like the

line out and she says I'm going to tell

you something for free then maybe we can

forge a deal and she leans into the

earth and whispers in your ear

and strikes here like right up there

probably ask you she doesn't seem to

care he says it's

what she said the king of the cross

trade was there when the concordance was

signed and a deal struck her payment as

a mediator was a piece of the last block

Ava's soul you ever have a feeling that

you're incomplete never in charge of

your own feet your own destiny that's

why that's nonsense I've only ever made

my own faith my own destiny I've only

ever done everything myself none this

means anything here you are working for

her to get her lost book to gain mr.

Fox's spectacles really boy are you that

naive shut up would you like us to bring

you himesh cos happy box shut up that's

enough yes the box I don't like what

that's called

[Laughter]

he says the box

think about it I don't need a system we

don't need it

why are the other hags taking so long

we're done here they're traveling I

don't even know what that means it's

really backed up she'll turn to you then

I'll deal with you instead

fine no damn it the box for your wound

fine whatever guilt

no I will not absolutely oh we have a

time think it over

and she'll go off and putter around

occasionally it goes over to check on

the little girl maybe pokes her with a

stick and then she starts she drags

Monch Mina over to a chopping block and

proceeds to cut him into little pieces

starting with his jorts Alton Paulding

looks over that it's like was she

chocolate see anything it's like give it

a second all right I got it

um I'll call oh oh oh I want to talk to

the hag I wanna oh yeah you go over

while she's chopping with this big

cleaver kaboom splat splat and just

throwing big chunks of pieces of into

baskets basically and she's kind of

sorting it as she chops it so entrails

go into that basket and legs go into

that basket you know that kind of thing

um so I like I like go over her I'm not

gonna like make a big scene out of it

but um I'm gonna ask her like so so so

you could be brought people back that's

kind of what we will we've talked about

it briefly yeah brought people

back from the dead Z's she says sure no

not really

no oh okay last weekend as we're doing

here

bring a scroll to help you bring the

dead back and we do have magic powerful

magic interesting and as you're talking

to her she suddenly throws the cleaver

up in the air and just clutches her eyes

and starts to blindly kind of stumble

around and the rest of you see it as

well she something paltin said just

caused her to lose her and now

she's running around her workshop

mausoleum with her hands over her eyes

well it's just like nope gods and

then she thought she sort of runs into

something hard bangs her head off it and

just kind of stands there and she says

yeah it had so much I know it wasn't you

it was you what am I saying

[Laughter]

yeah so this blind hag is running around

now and she says I made you paint

Oh like having daggers stuck in my eyes

you okay

she sort of reaches around for like a

stool or something to sit on she finds

basically this rotted out torso that I

guess was entombed in this mausoleum

before they moved in and she just sort

of sits down on it's spongy mass and you

can see the ants to start sort of

crawling all around her feverishly are

you okay clowns yeah you

probably shouldn't have made those I

mean we're bad enough the next ones will

be better no no you don't need more

listen if I agree to this child or

whatever will you not make clones

anymore no great great deal making right

there no deal then I would have agreed

to it but the clones were a deal breaker

yeah there we go

good no deal we're done with that thank

you wait no waiting sort of blindly

points but not at any of you I need to

consult with my sisters when they return

this is not a decision I can make on my

own Alton like helps her and like just

like moves her hand like no clones well

whatever else you want to do with me I

don't care but no clones I'll discuss it

with my sisters when they return fine I

did it all right so sometime is going to

pass while you chill out waiting for

baggy Nana and Peggy dead Bella's to

return with the stuff meanwhile on

heaven evylyn oh yeah what

evylyn what heavenly things would you

like to be doing knowing that you know

you're in having a great time you're in

the fantastic domain of Lysander you can

explore it to your heart's content you

can meet all kinds of people and when

you do and you know your natural

instinct is to regale them with the

glories of the more

they they seem very well and truly aware

of how great the morning Lord is and

they're more than pleased to give you

their time is possible they'll play with

you they'll tell you about places

they've seen you'll stop and like watch

the Sun and pick fantastic shapes out of

the clouds some lovely young men and

women to talk to as well as older folks

milling around you can see within the

Dominion of Lysander people seem to be

doing whatever they want and sometimes

there's groups of people sort of

enjoying other's company other times you

just stumble upon a lone person who's on

a mountainside talking you know talking

to a goat over down by the river you

know

skipping rocks across the water watching

the Sultan gleam off its surface I

imagine that maybe she kind of develops

a special friendship with Czarist after

she was kind of like her mentor in this

place almost yeah and it really

reverberates with her strongly like you

know evil ins like shiny things distract

her like crazy so it takes her a little

while to kind of like really

conceptualize what's going on because

like ooh pretty Sun ooh pretty grass ooh

pretty person you know but uh pretty

soon it comes around to her that like

this question of what is it that you

actually want is really haunting her and

that leads her just suddenly gasp and

then go looking for Dora is there s and

say and she she describes Simon the the

soul that she saw yeah um and she says

have you seen someone like that here she

tells you that she hasn't seen anybody

like that here and the two of you when

you kind of think about it you don't

sense his presence anywhere normally in

the sort of the warmth of Lysander when

everybody's sort of part of Lysander you

can kind of feel each other get a sense

of of that and you don't feel like he

on this plane with you but this what

that means she says well it could be

that his soul went to somewhere else to

another plane is that bad it depends if

he is if he was a good soul he may have

gone to one of the other good dominions

if he was a evil soul which I doubt if

he was with you but if he were he would

go to one of the lower planes hmm I just

feel I feel kind of responsible cuz you

know he was kind of kind of like family

and if you know I kind of wanted to ask

him a few questions cuz I never really

got to talk to him much when when we

were on earth so there's no way to like

talk to someone who's on a different

plane than you right from here right we

are spirits now we are bound to this

place this is our pro lack of a better

word afterlife he is in his own

afterlife somewhere and these two the

his Dominion and our Dominion we we

exist apart we are no longer alive yeah

we're we can't go anywhere at least not

until your friends try to bring you back

to their world and she sort of notes

you're sort of silvery aura I mean if

they do try I don't know I kind of

forced myself on them to begin with so

mm-hmm I'm not sure I don't know I think

I think I just wanted to tell him how

much I I loved him and and that we

always wanted him around cuz I realized

maybe he felt the same way maybe you

know that he was just there to be useful

or just there by happenstance you know

but I think you know you asked me

whatever I really wanted and I think all

I ever really wanted was to be wanted

and I wanted him to know that he was

wanted and that's why it's good to be

here cuz Lysander has always wanted me

and loved me and that's what's important

I agree and she says so Simon was like

family to you mm-hmm

he was my adopted son yet he was if I

understand correctly a construct well I

mean kinda but yeah I was a construct

but alive did you know that you weren't

always a construct well yeah I mean I

think he was alive he seemed alive to me

and I saw his soul

you saw his spirit then he was alive

yeah why do you ask I just think it's

remarkable how the multiverse brings the

souls stray Souls together yeah isn't

that the truth did you have a family oh

yes I had a husband I had children

grandchildren many friends I some of

them were with me at the very end that

sounds nice

it was I had a family and they loved me

very much but I don't think they wanted

me around they sent me away why did they

do that just circles and ER just like my

dad what was he like well he was the

best he's always smiling and he's always

going on adventures and he was always

doing the will of a sander and helping

people but he was gone a lot but he did

he did bring me back presents and he was

always looking out for me you know

trying to make sure that his little girl

had everything she needed and protecting

me from anyone who might you know look

down on me or anything like that how do

you talk to him

I can talk to him how

he is here living in my fenders Dominion

he is what do I do that sensi thing yeah

pretty much

you can just see tries to sense where

our dad is yeah you're having some

trouble spinning around looking for your

dad daddies and the rest says just get

on your horse and go follow your heart

it will take you where you need to go

follow my heart she kind of sticks her

chest out and she's like tries to follow

it not a literal heart just the love the

longing that you feel to be with him

again use that guide you hear okay

Morning Glory haiku yep horse appears

you hop on it you sail off so she's just

she's yelling like you know when you're

a kid you were just like yell down the

stairs at your parents dad all right and

you are able to fly to a glittering

temple on top of a hill and you can see

there is a large Sun symbol a Golden Sun

simple atop its great dome and there are

pillars all around it it's almost like a

big giant domed gazebo stone gazebo and

within you can see a glittering statue

of the morning Lord as a sort of radiant

man holding cradling a baby in his arms

with and carved into the pillars that

you can see images of all the various

Saints and things who have followed

levander some you recognize some you

don't

there's probably distracts her for quite

some time she probably flies around

looking at all these things yeah

you can you can see that there are a

number of spectral forms like yourself

moving around inside this space and many

of them are most many of them are

cradling spectral children lovingly and

there's music also playing in the air

and you can see that there is a giant of

a figure about ten feet tall with

angelic wings and green skin just a

hairless green skinned angel with white

wings and silvery pools for eyes going

around and just sort of touching the

kids on the heads and as it does the

children sort of become luminous for an

instant and then you see them transform

one by one into kind of like an

idealized form usually like a young

adults or an adult and then they begin

talking to the people around them

can I roll a religion check to see if I

understand what's happening sure I

really use my religion check which is so

bad too busy talking about it to think

about it I know right thirteen you can

see that basically there are children in

the multiverse who for whatever reason

do not survive the travails of their

worlds but their souls are still born

here and rather than sort of condemn

them to a life of being an infant who

can't sort of appreciate the world

around them they are brought to a later

phase of their life which they never got

to live mmm sort of a point in their

life which is for them sort of idealized

sort of the point where they should have

reached a certain point in their life

where they gain an appreciation for life

if their life hadn't been snuffed out

before that happened and this planet are

is sort of pointing at them and although

you can't tell what's going on maybe

telepathically telling them who they are

and so and it's like they never died

it's like they had a life that happened

and unfolded and now they're just here

and enjoying the company of other other

people like them and they're being sort

of introduced to the to the the spirits

that were carrying them these these

other beings who have lived here for a

long time who are sort of like their

mentors and custodians kind of like what

does the rest has become to you mm-hm

and you can see one of those figures is

remarkably similar to a man you once

knew well your dad I fly by the green

skinned angel and as I go I'm like oh

hey big fan my name is even bye

and then I I'll and you know with like

the outstretched wings of mourning

Leeson's big epic entrance yes and he

turned and a several of them turned to

face you and you can see that his eyes

are his eyes are glow his smile is as

warm as you remember it I think a

feeling just kind of freezes staring at

him okay this is kind of more than she

can even understand he just comes over

and sort of puts a soft hand on

morning-glories nose and you can you can

feel that the know for your your mount

is is very calm around him even gets off

Morning Glory and just walks up to him

and kind of is like staring at him and

disbelief she's like to you do you do

you recognize me yes

evey I can't believe it she just starts

I mean can she cry now yeah well yeah

yeah so she just starts crying and wraps

her hands around his neck and just

blubbering so much I've so much to tell

you so it just happened to Mac I try to

be as good as I could serve the theatre

and I hope you're proud of me and his

mom here oh my gosh is mom here I just

you're here no mom went to the dark

place no yeah you can absolutely you can

he will tell you that she is in one of

the great temples of the morning Lord

right now but she'll he'll he'll be

happy to he'll be happy to take you

there I have so many questions I have so

many things to tell you I haven't seen

you since I was how do you even know who

I am what do you mean I mean I'm I'm

grown up I know but this is how I always

saw you I must admit it doesn't look

like you may be here for very long

what why do you think so it looks to me

like there's something something about

you suggests that maybe you're just here

for a short visit and we should make

most of the time that we have she grabs

his hands yeah I have so many things to

talk to you about I met I met these

people and one was a tiefling and she

had horns but she was really really nice

and you know then there was one that was

a he was but not he didn't steal things

but he was you know sometimes through

daggers and then there was enough there

was another one that he was you see here

he's starting to weep a little bit dad

why are you crying just like your mother

she starts crying it back I've just

missed you guys so much I wish you

didn't have to well I mean I'm glad

you're here cuz I'm certain here is

better than there but well I don't know

if you remember but I always said that

no matter what happens to us we will

always be together

well here we are

and you can see that there are some

other there's some other kind of people

just sort of looking at you like home

and so you like perhaps we should go

somewhere this is morning glory isn't

she pretty

she is I love horses I know well let's

uh let's go for a ride yeah you want to

drive it's pretty excited when he

attacks she's like she's like a super

sports car paladin mouth-like even has

the fancy like souped-up classic Mustang

or something and she's like dad you want

to drive yeah attach like a side horse

you have a little side horse alright and

so you take to the air with your pops

and you you fly around and Morning Glory

takes you on a hell of a ride Wow what

okay no go on um as they're as they're

flying evens like you know mom never

really wanted to talk much about what

happened when you you know stopped being

alive mm-hmm what I know that you were

serving the will of the morning Lord and

and doing good in the world but she

never came back and I never really

learned what happened he says well a

small group of us went off to bring the

light of the morning Lord to a very dark

place and

well everybody everybody Falls and I

died helping and saving good people

my friends innocent people and there was

really nothing I could do except trust

in my faith that these that I would be

given and granted the power by the

morning Lord to do exactly what I was

trained to do and help these people

survive and combat the Menace do you

want to know specifically what happened

yeah what dark place I've been to some

dark places

are you familiar with char I've heard of

her

there are those who unlike us want to

cast the world into darkness and there

is a family that has or a group that has

basically fallen into the dark service

of char and they infiltrated cities

throughout the north I was killed by a

vampire which one I hate vampires

her name is caressed ax delving stone I

don't think I've met her she lives in

under mountain hmm which you know what's

the great dungeon underwater demon huh

well it sounds like you were doing your

best to protect people and she struck

you down

she and her vampire associates we killed

many of them dozens of them but by the

time she showed up I was already pretty

messed up yeah pretty amazing fighter I

can imagine I mean I can't I I've tried

to kill some vampires they're kind of

hard to kill but I'm pretty sure we

drove them deeper deeper down farther

away from the city itself and the city

has been safer ever since are you able

to watch from up there what goes on up

here what goes on down there no so you

don't even know anything that happened

was with me or brick or anything well

whenever someone from our world dies if

they're tied to Lysander they end up

here I do ask questions so I've heard

things from them but I don't have a

first-hand account of what the world is

like now did you ever want to come back

did I ever want to come back well I

didn't want to be away from you and your

mother but the call of Lysander brought

me here and if I that if my if my body

could have been recovered from the and

taken to the spires of the morning the

temple in water deep it's possible I

might still be in the world today I

could have been raised I could have been

resurrected but I never made it out of

under mountain so you don't think it's

necessarily a bad idea to hope to to go

back for a while

no because I mean cuz it when when all

is done you will come here and live out

the rest of your existence in this place

this great Dominion of sunlight and

rebirth and dawn and hope and that is

eternal it's just so hard to give up

spending time with you now when I I just

missed you so much when we were down

there if you return to the world and

I'll see you again when you return here

for me will be as if no time passed

practically

because time here really doesn't have

much meaning really it can seem like a

thousand years and a day at the same

time how so it's just it's hard to

explain when time has no meaning and you

just sort of exist in a state of

eternity you can do all the things you

ever wanted to do here in no time at all

or you could spend what feels like a

lifetime here and no time may pass in

the world beyond so you've been you've

been missing us for just a second and

for all eternity exactly I feel like

we've only been apart for months and at

the same part at the same point I also

feel like we've been apart for years but

it doesn't change how much I love you I

love you too dad we should do something

fun

like what

let's go tobogganing what's a toboggan

let me show you going back to the waffle

crew the other rest of the awful crew

screaming at each other still screaming

at each other you can see that Widow

grub blindness eventually passes and she

regains her sight again but they're

still kind of blurry eyed and very very

upset as you guys have been ranting and

railing one things you notice is this

mausoleum that you're in is quite roomy

but it's also very very old and crumbly

and there is actually a door set into

one wall it's a big stone door and it's

closed like the outer door of a

mausoleum but there it is it appears to

be the only entrance and exit that you

can see and as for the mausoleums

contents the hags have made their homes

here kind of using old circles and they

basically piled bones into corners and

things and made beds out of them and

that kind of thing so they've kind of

just cut taken over this crypt of the

dead cool so you guys just gonna chill

till the others return I mean we're

still waiting on those objects so yep

yeah okay so after what feels like maybe

about a day Jesus Wow

yeah the the hag with the bag over her

head appears basically as a ghost in the

room just sort of walks in to the

mausoleum as a ghost and you can and she

solidifies becomes flesh once more and

in her hand you can see what appears to

be a blackened scroll tube with some

glyphs carved into it and it's got a

sort of a big brass stopper at one end

and a chain it looks like it was the

chain is snapped like it was ripped off

of somebody's belt or off of something

and she just got it in hand and she says

what resurrections cloud yep and she

just sort of before she she tries to

hand it to you but then the widow groped

just sort of stops her and all did and

says we must wait yep waiting on the

other objects all right

by this time you guys can if you need to

take like a long rest or something you

can okay are you going to try to sleep

at all or stay awake the whole time I'm

gonna I'm gonna sleep it off okay if I

can strategically place it so that the

hags are not in the hut you can know

that cool yeah if we can hunt then sure

you you hang out in the hut you can see

the hags having a argument the two of

them mostly having to do with the

destruction of an imp and whatever the

destruction of a bag and they start to

talk about clones and pretty much

recounting trying to fake piece together

based on what they glimpsed in the eye

what actually happened on the street

support anions are oh right and the bag

one says I'll have to make some more

this time we have to get it right

they were defective clearly and widow

grote says well let's not be too hasty

here we have another deal unfolding we

don't want to muck it up if we can get

this this all blows great price jokes on

them we are defective and it's not about

that

the copies are perfect the originals are

flawed

I have a deal there's a deal you know

there's no deal the sister of the sister

of the chicken foot government says she

will carry one of our children

absolutely not she won't she might know

and then and then the one with the bag

head says God and we can get rid of

Peggy once and for all which is funny

because previously widowed groats said

they were trying to oust bag lady now

these two are saying it's the other one

whatever little little night hag

politics unfolding off in the corner

there somebody's lying to somebody but

in due course the third hag returns and

you can see that she's got tucked under

her arm a big fat spell book and she's

got sort of perched on her crooked nose

a set of tinted pink spectacles mm-hmm

there they are

that's them right that's gonna be them

and did you have any trouble sister no

it was easy he was asleep and one book

one pair of spectacles and he has the

scroll now the parts of yourselves any

of us no more clones you can do whatever

spent the most time with what over it

ever had a child before she what she

puts a hand over your stomach it just

kind of squishes it

I don't know what you're doing but and

find it very uncomfortable which which

hag is like doing that turn groping her

that would be widow groped the one with

the coins on her eyes and which one was

saying like one person's like we're

gonna get rid of Peggy or but before

they're like other is that the same one

same one I'm gonna while she's doing

that I want to like lean in and like

whisper I'll be like how about you throw

ksham Eska has we'll get it on her own

we don't need their help and on the

floor is uh is Peggy in in the group are

they all together all together okay okay

this is so gross let's get this over

with

yes Doug if it turns out yes sorry

you'll pull a single strand of hair out

Mick that's all you need right you could

maybe give us a couple extra ah no just

the one is what I believe is what we

said she looks at it hands it to a

sister

they each inspected it's a little short

all right they put it in a vial right

misterx we'll give them one of the hairs

and also said I will do anything to save

my friend it's just not wake wing

strictest please I have a much better

idea why are you looking at me weird

didn't trust me how do they get hairs

from all three of you

yes palton that bag lady bag head be

lady comes over to you and the

slithering Viper comes out and stares

you in the eye and she holds out a hand

for some of your hair right yes she

takes it and goes off cackling good your

death will then go and take the scroll

and hand that to paltin pick up this

spell book give that to Strix and then

we'll take the spectacles

palton when you pick up the scroll case

it's it's very warm unusually warm this

wouldn't squirrel tube-like it just came

out of a hot fire uh-huh but why why why

is this warm I'm sure is it he said she

says I took it off a dead cleric in the

bowels of the nine hells Oh sounds like

they didn't need it anymore

sounds warm down there the fit fair

enough

all right all good yes you've so you've

got the other two items DF you said the

Gila spectacles and then hand the spell

book two strips okay so the items are

now divvied up between you

this down scroll paltin oh no DF has the

spectacles and Strix has the book

all right now to the other matter right

how did I do here get back to port we

need to get back to port and irons ro

how do we get there these points right

direction

what is that information West special

box first we'll get it on our own

please straight oh we can we can could

do anything on our own good luck with

that yes good luck with that like I

already agreed I don't know what you

want to do when I just want you to save

my friend look you can't just let them

put a baby in YouTube give birth to

another hag just like an owl specky I

don't know what that means I say that

loud enough that they can all hear one

of the hags Peggy says ask me talking

about yeah while you're gone then

they're tourists saying that they need a

new hag so they can get rid of you which

is weird because I think they said they

wanted to get rid of baggy what and

usually we start they start chattering

amongst each other and then it starts

turning into a shoving contest and then

suddenly the hags are all clawing at

each other's eyes and pulling on each

other's hair and basically throwing each

other around the room and by throwing I

mean literally like picking each other

up and hurling each other ten fifteen

feet across the room when Ruth yeah and

then one of them yells can you smell

what Peggy is cooking so as soon as they

start they start throwing down like that

deal turns back to his tricks in paltin

it's like it says like now let's get out

of here it has pointed towards the other

that's fair saving my friends also means

running away okay so you get to the door

it's a big stone door and it's quite

heavy do you want to like just pull

together pull it open or one of you

trying yeah

if those guys want to try to do that

where was the small girl she was in a

chicken coop and up against one wall of

the room

all right and where's that relations the

rest the heads right now and she's by

now she would have awakened from the

sleep spell and she's just kind of in

the cage

frightened so as it happens as you turn

back and remember girl and you look back

you can see one of the hags the one at

the bag gets thrown and kind of lands on

the chicken coop and then the chicken

coop sort of crumbles and collapses

underneath her and the girl spills out

oh great oh yeah we for sure like or

just like come on

all right yeah get that door open yes

we'll go for the cutting action -

whatever let's use this ultimate speed

we'll go back for the girl and try to

pick her up and like kind of oyster over

- just get us all out of here okay so

you hoist her up what are you gonna do -

open the door push it or use the handle

there is a look looks like a big pull

handle on the door somebody who opens

the door asked to make a strength

athletics check - pull it open right so

maybe not des oh are you guys together

yeah we can do it together okay if Strix

is aiding you palton you have advantage

on your strength and let extractor

rippling store wall that is double 15

okay that it so here's a bonus mmm that

with your strength bonus or just his

strength is +2 so he's actually 17 then

yes okay yes you're able to pull it open

about two feet enough for easily for you

to slip past and outside okay let's go

when you go outside you can see it is

stifling out here so you're instantly

you realize you're in the tropics and

actually you're familiar with where you

are oh you you are the outskirts of Port

nyan when when you left the city you

went through some gates out into some

old ziggurats and ruins out there you

emerge from one of those ruined

mausoleums in what's called the old city

the city outside the walls so as you

look around you can see these crumbling

ziggurats and other mausoleums around

you there's big tall palisade a big tall

wall with palisade on top and guard

towers and the gates of Port lions are

oh stand open awesome yeah we're going

dive straight into there as fast as we

can and then lose ourselves within this

city okay I don't know it's like it's

actually chasing us remember like we're

getting out you can hear the hags

cursing each other inside and smashing

bones and knocked where's the bomb

where's the bomb if you have the bomb

we're not doing leave them leave the

bomb I could reach the port no couldn't

it's fine I think it would reach the

port yeah you know that if if that

device well yeah you've done in our kind

of check on this but once before oh yeah

yeah yeah you know that if you were to

set it off here it would take out

probably the entire old city outside the

walls and probably a like one twentieth

of the city proper no we don't know how

innocent they got their bombs

yep gates okay yes so you run through

the gates into the city and you see all

of the native Charlton's

kind of stair agog at you because you're

you look panicked yeah it's because you

are now if you are now free far free and

clear of the hags you've left them

behind

alright awesome I'll Kyle let the girl

down to our feet and I'll kneel down

like hang on her shoulders like hey do
