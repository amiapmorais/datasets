you

[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to the latest

episode of dice camera action hey this

is our post pax unplugged episode which

if you didn't see you should definitely

go watch I think in the top like the top

few episodes in terms of like

meaningfulness for the oh yeah I think

that's crazy much appreciated by the

player alright so what happened the

characters having completed their patrol

for commander break bone of camp

vengeance returned to the fort to find

it being assailed by an army of undead

zombies and ghouls Strix and evylyn went

headlong into the battle and flying high

up above it started to blow the undead

to pieces with fireballs and moon beam

spells meanwhile deaaath on the back of

waffles galumph toward the fort and

infiltrated it from a different side

than the undead were attacking and also

ran into a sneaky pack of ghouls that

were trying to gain access to the fort

as well after getting inside the fort or

let me think Strix went down into the

fort and untaught a barrel of oil

presumably with the intention smearing

it dumping it all over undead and

lighting them on fire

that's when a portal opened and out

stepped a mercy killer and some entities

from a distant plane that the party

didn't know what to make of and the

mercy killer threw some magical shackles

on Strix and threatened to drag her back

home

d/f interceded evylyn interceded and a

paladin that nobody had met before

interceded

and did everything they could to prevent

this mercy killer from succeeding in its

mission one of the creatures that

accompanied it turned out to be a

walking time bomb that started to

countdown threatening to blow the fort

to smithereens

but the waffle crew was able to smash it

to pieces and prevent it from detonating

and ultimately were able to thwart the

mercy killer after it was unable to get

strips it impaled D F on its armored

spikes ah took him to the distant planar

city of sigil and there the party fought

the mercy killer until he fell and was

killed by this paladin Carrick

I hoped absolutely yes everyone was

enormous ly helpful at the broom also

helped the broom also helped the mercy

killer broke it over his knee so the

broom was no more after the mercy killer

fell Strix decided that she was going to

stay in sigil because she realized she

was being hunted by these beings and

that they would keep coming after the

waffle crew if she stayed with them but

she was persuaded by her friends to

abandon that scheme and the waffle crew

returned back to port vengeance stepping

through the portal after DF figured out

how to reactivate it

before leaving sigil DF saw over his

shoulder a figure that he remembered

from his childhood a man with angelic

features the same man who gave him the

ring of keys but did not speak with this

man instead he followed his friends back

through the portal and it closed behind

him alright so a Susan on the other side

of the portal and I have returned yes

the first thing I do is I take that

portal key and I destroy it

okay I think I stabbed it cut with the

storm rip it up whoever - yeah I just

destroy that and get rid of it right

yeah it looked like a little Christmas

tree air freshener so you're able to

basically tear it up and destroy it

utterly yes okay you are standing in the

mud in the heart of camp Vengeance the

guards on the wall are fighting

the last remnants of the undead but it

looks like there's no danger of the

undead swarming over the fort too many

of them were destroyed by fireballs and

moonbeams Strix is not standing down

little air bubbles okay everyone tries

to comfort her

there there okay you're fine she's just

not non-responsive she's just like in

the mud so can I tell from where I am

that the that the onslaught is kind of

dying down and they are repelling and

effectively yes okay things are kind of

resolving I kind of look around and I'm

like we should we should probably find

palton I think he's out also I'd like to

get the hardest Spinelli back and

where's waffles uh that's that's another

thing I was going to do yeah

you'll probably get there faster than me

evil and there's probably a few zombies

up I just want to fly out there real

quick I kind of point the direction that

I came from right I'd left them like

look around here for dragon baits

lasa and wolf waffles shouldn't be too

far from there just go find them alright

will you just will you take B if can you

just take care wait wait it's tricky

okay here's the thing about that you

stand up you can see the two halves of

the broom lying on the line I'm guessing

they're not sticking back together

yourself I don't have a we'll find

someone that does so I'll just eat them

okay so you you have the two halves and

you're evil in your fluttering up to go

find waffles and company yeah okay

d/f you can see over at the base of the

wall of the half-orc umbral the priest

of Torme is in the midst of healing two

wounded soldiers

okay just sort of lying up against the

wall but you haven't seen any of the

other four captains or commanders the

three of them commander bring bone or

his two captains fire beard and saw Hana

and there's still a bunch of frogs

around correct there are still a bunch

of babies and frogs hopping around yet I

imagine I'm just like sitting on strips

and she's crying with the broom and just

frogs like I not seeing them is so I

guess slightly concerning to me but not

I priority okay if will stay with Strix

until evil and returns great evil and

make a perception check all right so you

fly around north and northwest of the

fort looking for signs of waffles and

company and you do not immediately find

them all right eventually coming out of

the foliage you see waffles and two

[Music]

slick bare-chested men one with a

javelin and one with parts the part of

Spinelli your flaming sword

do they look bloodied like did they do

any damage with them no they seem okay

no I mean like the weapons did they do

the weapons have Gorham you can't tell

by roll the seven yeah yeah I approach

them I go I give waffles a big hug

around her big fluffy neck okay

oh very okay

[Music]

okay and then I see how Larsa and will

far and okay

they tell they tell you that after DF

went over the wall they and the albear

fought off some ghouls so many did you

kill five I give them like a fist bump

each okay I'm like are you uh are you

finished using the stabby stabby y'all

done he he says yeah he hands it back to

you sweet good I didn't lose the sword

Jude I'm glad I would've been real upset

yeah

they haven't seen they haven't seen the

dinosaur man or the the guy with the

bagpipes oh well

waffles Search Search mission starts now

I jump on her back another just kind of

looking around and if there's any undead

still just gonna mostly avoid clothes

okay alright I'm just gonna pop in

alright

[Music]

waffles is able to guide you right to

them palton after she the hordes and

hordes of undead is sailing the fort and

basically saying new is there anything

that you wanted to do in particular

while you were hanging out in the jungle

[Music]

hmm I can't think of anything that I

need to do here okay so alright and

you've still got Simon with you and he's

got a cask on his back with the straw

that you can drink from good place

you realize you're getting to the bottom

of the cask you can hear that sort of

dry sucking noise tragedy is nigh

the reason you leave and then you see

dragon bait sort of come out of some

foliage and look at you

and he when he lays eyes on you he gives

off an odor and that odor is did you do

hmm

lemon he smells like lemon do I remember

what that means you can make a

intelligence check sixteen you believe

that means pleasure or joy somebody and

then you hear off in the distance about

five minutes later you hear I'm just

like that voice I swear I've heard it

somewhere I should look into that

now head toward it okay dragon bait will

follow you sort of vigilantly looking

around watching the bushes see if any

making sure no one dead jumps out at you

and none do and eventually you come

face-to-face with waffles as she barrels

into you and takes you down to ground

[Music]

starts licking you hmm

with her rough sandpaper tongue hunch

down like a jump on

I don't like get waffles offer or

anything I'm like Paul did you just miss

the craziest thing and there was this

paladin and he was an oath of the

Ancients too and he likes saved us all

and we killed a mercy killer and Strix

was going to sacrifice herself with

Napolitan the Paladin can mist her no

and he's really cool you should have met

him I think he's just the neatest thing

I hope we see him again

but oh my gosh and then DN was impaled

on a spike in nose blood coming out of

her got that until he brought it up

again because it was scary and I locked

it up and I just continued to go I hate

your ass I'm just like alright usually

someone else cuts her off alright by the

time you guys get back to the fort all

of the undead have been driven off or

slaughtered there's a big mound of

corpses outside the forth so can we just

kind of waltz in the front door yeah

Strix is lying in pile of corpses and

DfE Strix they've been gone about a half

hour so you have a lot of time okay the

only thing I kind of do is kind of

haphazardly kind of tend to my wound

during this not like looking or seeking

for help or like asking for it cuz most

he's like still kind of being near Strix

cuz I like making sure she's okay about

this Charlie stopping the hose okay I

don't I because of being a divine soul

you can either have cure wounds or you

can have inflict wounds depending on

your your affinity as good or evil what

Strix isn't evil okay so would she have

inflicted wounds or cure wounds either

okay

well she's gonna take cure wounds

because inflicted wounds is useless

frankly she didn't do that every day

sorry hmm so if she sees Dee of trying

to like fix himself she'll just like

from the ground holding her broom while

in the ground just like nonchalantly

cast cure wounds all right kids give him

so healing role die I actually don't

know how to do that

I've never done that it's the cure wing

spell right I think 1d8

plus wisdom or just guess you're casting

in doesn't cure wounds right yeah right

so it's equal to one D eight plus your

spell casting ability amount of foam

which is a lot so it's one da plus 16 no

it's one I can't no my no what's your

what's your oh it's no I'm sorry for

yeah I was reading too many numbers all

right what do you plus four okay so okay

so 7 plus 4 11 it's at roughly that time

that you hear coming from the command

tent first of all you hear from the

watchtower that the albear and the

others are approaching the fort then you

hear coming from the command tent kill

them all kill them all

so Strix has never done that before

mm-hmm so death is actually kind of

taken a little aback by that but before

he can address that he hears like the

tent and realized what's going on right

when she's still facedown in the ground

probably like crawled over and just like

touched with one tiny finger just like

[Music]

all right do I still have a good amount

of frogs with me yeah you have there's

like a half dozen sort of leaping around

around your feet okay I'm just gonna

quickly scoop up a few more okay just to

kind of add to it I'll even try to

address Strix at this point and tell her

to kind of help me get some frogs cuz

like we got a stick to the plan get some

frog Strix around easily standing now

yeah you don't have to do much you just

have to take your hat off and put it

down to the ground the u.s. officers

this is also to leap into it

there just like it just stands there

really depressed they go right for it

suddenly I like eight of them in there

that's great yeah perfect right all

right cool

so then I'm gonna like I tuck those away

and have them ready and then I'm going

to with Strix I kind of lead her to go

with me towards this tent okay well I

assumed that wasn't the voice of

breakbone that I was hearing yep yeah so

I'm gonna head towards that okay nice

when you peel back the folds of the

command tent you see Commander breakbone

is on top of his table his trellis table

standing there terrified and pointing at

hoppy little baby Grunk

and ordering his captain's to basically

kill and/or spear them you see Ord fire

beards picked up a spear and he's got

like yeah four dead groung babies stuck

on the spear and Captain Sahana is

Captain Sahana is not killing them she's

trying to kick them out of the tent with

her foot okay

so as soon as I get in there yeah

actually I'll hop up onto the table with

them okay kind of get my sword out and

look like I'm trying to protect him okay

great and then as soon as I'm up there

I'll turn to him say break moaning

there's too many they've overrun the

rest of the camp there's no way we got

to stop them all and I fear that I fear

that one of them may have touched me oh

just release the frogs like making a

scene just like tossing frogs Amir okay

you have to run okay I make a deception

checking and give you advantage okay

am i there to witness all this so I'll

let you know a moment you're not there

right now but you're gonna be there soon

okay 17 total okay you are successful he

leaps away from you off the trellis

table practically knocking you in the

table over as he Springs from it

and then he goes bolting out toward the

entrance of the fort just blasts out of

the tears open the back of the tent runs

outside just as evylyn and waffles and

dragon bait and paltin and the two

greased down guards are making their way

inside so the rest of you paltin evylyn

and company

you see captain breakbone burst out of

his command tent and come running pell

mell after you with like a little baby

grip leaf frog kind of following him and

he's just screaming his lungs out and as

he runs you can see his his breastplate

is sort of coming under as he tears ass

through the mud and he sort of slips in

slide his weight toward you so as soon

as he's out and gone like he's out of

there I just kind of calmly stand up

kind of brush myself off and then

address the other two in the room and

I'll just say captain fire beard looks

at you and says he's gonna kill you when

he gets back I'm still looking and say

we won't be here but I think we can all

agree that he is no longer fit for duty

the two captains sort of look at each

other knowingly like this is not new

information to them but you can see

there's their struggle is that you know

they're orders to follow this man come

from a higher authority you get that

sense right so they're not sure exactly

what to do but they captain Saldana

turns to you and says yeah I'm not going

to comment on that but suffice to say

you should probably leave soon we build

the only thing that we just need is the

information and how to get to or illunga

almost I think you've already had a map

made yes you can see what means she

pulls it out from underneath her armor

and hands it to you all right I'll take

that and inker yep she

what did you find

well we found them they're drunk and

breakbone has been leading you astray it

was his own vendetta in his own fear as

you've noticed against them that has led

you to the needless slaughter of men

that was not needed they're not the

threat it's still the undead ransacking

camp vengeance and thanks to her

communications with the groung we have a

better idea of where they're coming from

and in the sign of good faith

they've returned to previous prisoners

that have been missing from this camp

they're waiting for you outside

okay meanwhile outside paltin evylyn

what do you do is break bone runs toward

you shouting they've taken over the cab

Ron I let him go past and then if

there's anyone standing by I just you

know do the kind of like wow you think a

commander would just you know have a

little more guts Oh like start spreading

rumors like just basically telling

people like oh yeah he seems real unfit

for duty we probably shouldn't do what

he says okay yeah he sort of slips and

falls face-first in the mud kind of in

front of you and in front of the two

guards as soon as he hits the ground

just like that okay and then he picks

himself back up

one of the guards wolf actually sort of

extends a hand to sort of help him up

out of the mud and he just sort of pulls

away and he says don't touch me you know

that's no way to treat someone that you

let be captured by the Grug and then led

completely astray I told them that the

groun were dangerous when they really

were just defending themselves it's no

way to treat someone like that whole

Paladin guilt yeah yeah he only he only

half hears that as he runs toward the

rowboats have a nice trip don't come

back if you know what

no you

yeah swim in the river yeah it's really

refreshing don't break anything if you

see him climbing into a rowboat the

frogs are coming better ride ready keep

going

shouts your friend is dead he turned

into a pile of frogs you all reunite in

the command tent DF is fine there are

all bunch of hoppy little grip lis

babies all around the floor of the tent

yeah I bring the two guards I kind of

like present them back to the captain

and I tell them what happened to them

and I I kind of addressed them in in

farewell and well I say you know we have

to leave but uh you should make sure to

tell exactly what you experienced and

what you saw about the grown because

that poor little community is suffering

under this rule and also it's not doing

you all any favors to fight them and the

undead so I hope I can trust you to

spread the word also know that if

treated properly the groan could

actually be a very useful ally against

this threat and they have told us that

the undead are coming from the aldana

basin and with that information they

could probably pool their resources

together and help defend each other okay

as you do that you see a captain fire

beard staying there and he's still

holding the spear like five dead baby

groung impaled on it and then he just

sort of looks and sort of hangs his head

in shame we've all done things under

orders that were not proud of

Oh 0 @ 0 XP all right and so as you

prepare to leave with your map or

illunga

anything else that you want to grab or

take with you before though I do want to

go and find umbral ok yes you'd have no

trouble finding her she has tended to a

number of injured soldiers all right she

says she says when she looks at you I'm

sorry I have no more healing left it's

like I I'll be fine

don't worry about me just pretend to the

people here and I had asked her to kind

of be your eyes and ears while we were

away and just curious if she had any

other potentially useful information

that she could give us before we head

out yes she tells you that while you

were gone

some food crates were delivered with a

couple soldiers from portney and Zaru

and in one of the crates they found a

old human who claimed to be a a warrior

from a distant place he kept talking

about how he thought he was dead and now

then wasn't and he spent about a day and

a half two days at the camp kind of off

alone occasionally speaking to a few

guards here and there everyone thought

that he was sort of a seasoned warrior

someone who had maybe gotten a little

bit too deep in his cups

maybe he struck by mad monkey fever and

not quite had gotten over it

are we all in there to hear this just

yes not quiet he's he was a greater man

than any of us will ever know and Umbro

sort of looks around me she says he was

around just a few moments ago yeah he's

he's fighting his own battles

I wanted to see well Dean is doing this

if that chroniker is still there the

dead one

yeah the smashed one you're lying yeah

lying in this they won't hit the ground

yes those strings is number one priority

right now is to find out what crimes she

committed why they were so she wants to

she can find any kind of like bounty

notice or like he didn't anything on

that thing so she's just gonna be

picking apart every piece wall everyone

else is doing that yeah she finds gears

and like it's faceplate which is sort of

dented in and various pieces of it make

a per se wisdom perception check or

intelligence investigation if you prefer

oh I think all did do I don't know I

listen I only got a tanner you don't

find anything that you that would set

shed light on why they were sent after

you alright she just lays on top of it

okay alright even we'll ask for like a

little pen and paper

mm-hm yeah there's right some rate in

the command tent you can just grab it

yeah she she writes a little note and

gives like the equivalent of some sort

of I know I guess she puts her home

address like her her outside Waterdeep

address on it and she's like hope we see

again sometime right some little hearts

on it okay and then she gives it to one

of the guards and she's like if that

carrot ever comes back you give him this

okay okay carrot yeah you know big guy

paladin

he shakes his head they never met him

well I don't know if you ever meet

someone named carrot captain or at fire

bait will come over and snatch the note

and say if I see him I'll give it to him

hey thanks nice beard he looks warily at

paltin as he does

[Laughter]

all right anything else you guys want to

do I think we're good here okay this

place have wine yet they did get some

more wine with the last shipment of

crates as Captain Saldana my god me bad

where do I go

so before you leave paltin goes to a

crate and basically refills Simon's cask

with wine all right now the important

stuffs out so with this Napa to or

illunga that I have retrieved can I tell

are we it's a faster or more expedient

to get there if we leave from Camp

vengeance or do we need a double back a

little bit to get closer to where or

lunga actually is okay from where you

are you will want to proceed

basically westward toward the mist cliff

mountains because oral angola is sort of

in a bowl in the foothills of the

mountains in the jungle it's about from

where you are a 10-day journey away

should we try to take a long rest first

before we um now you might have you

might be able to move more swiftly if

you swing a little bit south where the

forest looks like it clears a little bit

and there are some tall plateaus that

you can walk between there is a marker

on the map indicating a town between you

and or illunga on one of the plateaus

that town is called Bala Bala Bala MB

AOA okay okay well if that is e if

that's a slightly faster path I would

rather take that and then we have a pit

stop along the way that we can use to

kind of resupply mm-hmm because ten days

is a long freaking time yes

and yeah especially if you're losing hit

points yes pretty concerned about that

well why okay so with that in all

information I'll return to the rest of

the party okay tonic finally gets all

like collected back up together and then

let them know that's exact information

that I just got in the and the path that

I think would be best okay

and then as you set out you just to sort

of fast forward a bit assuming your all

your business and fort and Camp

vengeance is done I think so

you're able to travel for three days and

restricts isn't sleeping because she's

scared okay just stop sleeping okay do

we get a long rest in there then yes you

will definitely get a long rest

great I need it and so in that time

Strix

palton and DFS maximum hit points will

each decrease by one okay what happens

as over these three days Strix is not

sleeping like what effects does that

have on her that we observe other than

the like usual Strix craziness you can

see well Strix are you eating and

drinking at least yeah I know she's

she's freaking she just doesn't want to

she doesn't want to sleep because she's

knows the mercy killers we're gonna come

back right and she just wants them to

take her first rather than her friends

you can see that she becomes office she

looks out of it more more than usual and

[Music]

but otherwise yeah she just looks like

that she's you know her eyes are getting

more increasingly bloodshot over time

and she becomes a little bit clumsier in

her footsteps and it kind of seems to

just kind of stare off into space a lot

more she was trying to prepare her

spells and she just doesn't she just

doesn't sleep

she probably has trouble concentrating

at night like she'll be studying she'll

be trying to internalize her spells and

then she'll get distracted or she'll

fall asleep for like a split second in

their head will jerk back she starts to

have conversations with herself more

than usual extra paranoid yep yep

are you trying to hide it from us Holly

yeah she drinks is trying to hide it for

sure she doesn't want the party to know

that she's staying awake every night

trying to not trying to make sure this

mercy killer doesn't get them so we just

noticed this erratic behavior can't

sleep where's the killer we'll get me

[Laughter]

[Music]

[Laughter]

evylyn notices this and I guess as

they're traveling she just kind of tries

to be like are you okay you look well

she's forgotten to feed waffles in like

two days

waffles is real hungry like I can beat

her you just have to tell me if you want

me to doesn't even hear you she's like

what even tries to talk to her and not

have any any success kind of is like

yeah dad do you do you know what's going

on with strikes like do you think she

got cursed or something like something's

weird she looks back and she's like

eating her hair or like I don't think

she's cursed but I don't think she's

well on the fourth morning after

spending another night in the comforts

of the waffle hut you set out once more

and you come to a clearing in the jungle

that looks like it was subjected to the

passing of some large behemoth you would

see trees that have sort of been pushed

away kind of widening this clearing but

more interesting than that is you can

see that there is evidence of fire here

and it's left scorch marks all over the

clearing no it's not not campfire but

like now it looks it looks unnatural

like you would say that it almost looks

like like the strafing of a like a

Dragons flame or something the way it

sort of streaks off away Alton's just

like guys I think my new album just went

through this forest we all have a good

laugh and then we realize the terrible

truth but we're all dying it's fine

Evelyn and paltin and DF can make

perception checks Strix can't because

she hasn't slept 20 days wow I am I am

still smug and patting myself what all

right

and yes you can see that dragon bait

also starts to shed an odor of

honeysuckle as he looks around do you

roll the 28th yeah okay Perkins you

notice quickly that this fire pattern is

a pattern like somebody burned a pattern

into the ground it was clearing Oh what

is it oh boy because it grounded on the

ground it's very hard to discern it

looks like it was a shaped fire

basically bronze looks all together to

smuggling yeah I know

evylyn could you maybe get some height

and see if this makes like a particular

symbol even flutters up with her boots

it looks down yep as you flutter up

about 30 feet and look down you can see

that it forms a blackened snake with its

mouth wide and what appears to be a

circle that it is about to devour a

circular patch of burnt ground oh isn't

that nice it's just a little kids

drawing

like a son of a snake with a ball just

playing playing ball the snake is yeah

and so I go down and I'm like it looks

like just that like some kid was like oh

I love my pet snake and I like to play

fetch with it and so I I made this

drawing of it you can see that on the it

blackened circle that's the Sun is the

carcass of what looks like a good sized

dinosaur I guess do I yes because it's

got its got little sort of burnt flares

coming off of it like rays of sun rays

yeah okay so I at first I'm like oh this

is cute a snake playing fetch but as

soon as she kind of sees the race she's

like oh and should you like does she can

she put two and two together like I know

that Ross has been saying praised under

and snake and blah blah blah like I

think that even knows that too right

they don't point fingers you guys you

guys had a lot of discussion in a brief

time that Wamba was there about Lysander

and denned are the night serpent enough

to piece this together okay so she was

like fluttering up in like lalala oh

what a pretty trip oh and then she like

slowed fight stance floats back to the

earth and it's kind of looking around

like I know you also know that Wamba was

with you long enough to know that you

were headed to or illunga right

evylyn yes everything okay

well just making sure that if anybody

comes and tries to you know attack

anyone or blaspheme my god that I'm

ready as soon as she hears blasting my

guys I go what that second one was oddly

specific she looks and she's like that's

that was what I thought I explained what

it was what I saw in the connection to

umba and I say I think we're about to

see our little goblin friend again real

soon I mean he's on oh man I'm your

friend

our goblin unfriend

we we don't know what he did to Jumba

Dewey we still he told us didn't eat so

I know he knew okay

somebody one of you was there I think it

was Nelson is a cloud right paltin was a

cloud who saw Wamba right he's a brother

down listen that is just that is out of

context there was a lot more context to

that you're not here to define what does

paltin say when I I'm like yeah it was

Mamba that Goblin I don't like that guy

yeah so you don't tell us what he did

yeah well there was that moment outside

of camp outside of the temple of camp

righteous where palton had that not cool

man moment when he confronted Wamba and

umbral basically threatened Wamba

accused him of killing his brother and

that's what kind that's what scared one

behalf yeah remember you hate that guy

so do i I mean I don't hate anyone I

love everyone but I think he needs to be

escorted into the light so she's trying

to get paltin to agree with her that one

was like the worst yeah so can I tell

how fresh this fire pattern is it looks

to be maybe a couple days old okay so

definitely and after the time and after

Evelyn pointed it out the dead stegosaur

lying on the Sun you could just kind of

see you the mound of it over the gray

over the grass that hasn't been burned

away drinks is gonna go walk over and

look at that stegosaur and see if

there's anything that might give us a

clue of where this goblin is or who did

it because he was powerful enough to do

that she knows that for a fact okay when

you go over to the sting of story you

can see there are some flies above it

just like there above you

[Laughter]

it looks like it's been you'd estimate

it's been rotting about a day all right

and as you get close I'm not gonna have

you make perception checks because your

perception because you're super tired so

you are surprised when creatures burst

out from inside it all right everybody

roll initiative 11 11 rule the 20 nice

what do you end up with 20 i also rolled

19 but it was like a better 19 than

Wamba and palton I rolled the highest of

ones so with your dexterity modifier you

end up with a 1 3 3 ok so they get a

surprise round on us-- tricks of course

they do

so Strix what leaps out at you are

basically gore covered blood covered

monkeys that's cool that's that's I'm

grievin grossed out Strix is like even a

little gross yeah and but there you can

see that they've got particularly wide

toothy mouths on that it seems almost

freakishly unnatural and as they emerge

you hear in your mind them shrieking

it's not an audible shrink at shriek

it's a mind shriek and I need you to

make there are four of them I would like

you to make for wisdom saving throws ok

a 13 and a 15 and

one more out forms sorry and twelve okay

you succeeded I didn't add my ring bonus

my plus two saving throws okay okay I'd

be at thirteen less you succeeded on

three of them and failed on one of them

you only have to fail one so you take 17

or surest reduction oh I should hold on

I should actually roll this I'm nothing

the average here oh yeah way higher you

take 13 psychic damage okay and our I've

been trying to use that saving throw

aura for so long and I so really get to

use it and this is a saving throw yeah

I'm sure I don't know why we're so cuz

you at the dinosaur gets there and

suddenly for monkeys leap out at her and

after taking the whatever 13 points of

psychic damage you are now stunned

alright so you're just reeling all of a

sudden and can't now while you are

stunned you can't really do a heck of a

lot so no yep okay and then peeling out

of the sky above you are two creatures

that look like bipedal Pteranodons

they look like pterodactyls with sort of

more humanoid bodies yeah okay and you

can see that they have nets that they

hurl down upon UDF and a plough you

evylyn oh those doesn't nexor meant for

anyone it's their their neutral nets

[Music]

oh yeah man all right so evylyn this net

unfurls above you you can see it seems

to be heavily weighted at the ends but

as the net casts down upon you you get

out of its way

he flutter out that let hits the ground

ineffectually DF yours was a 22 hit it's

just an armor class thing yeah

uncanny doc no it won't apply here

because you're not taking any damage I

know you are restrained as the night

falls down upon you and pins you to the

ground okay it's like a weighted yep yep

okay and when it hits you you just sort

of hit the ground alright and so those

two flying Pteranodons and their large

creatures they've got wing spans of

close to they're about ten feet tall

with twenty foot wingspans so they're

now circling overhead and then twenty

yes things are huge

yep and now it is normally strix astern

now strix

at the end of your turn you get to make

a new saving throw to try to end the

stunned condition Hey so make another

wisdom save alright you are no longer

stunned alright but you and now have

four feral monkeys as tall as you are

standing around you

oh they're huge okay well they're medium

so still yeah I mean for monkeys debate

for monkeys that's really yeah they're

big yeah

and so those four glower over you but

they haven't gone yet and so it is now

DF & Wamba who's got the higher

dexterity score definitely DF DF you are

currently restrained you can try to use

an action to remove the net alright do I

find that I'm able to just get myself

out of it or is there something I need

like there's a way down at I'll have I

cut my way through

well you have a you can either try to

voice that off you which is a strength

athletics check

or you can attack it essentially and try

to do enough damage to it that you can

cut a hole through it and I think I'm

actually better off just trying to cut

my way through okay so just uh just make

an attack roll against the net that's a

normal attack roll all right and since

I'm like kind of restrained it's kind of

tight in there I might imagine I just

end up getting one like one of my

throwing daggers and I'm using that to

cut my way through a lot of sword yeah

that would be ideal

yeah but on the same token your short

sword isn't that much longer than your

dagger so you can use that okay good I

will if I have the like arm movement for

it I will use this work yeah just for a

little bit actually damage okay all

right you're right your attack role has

disadvantage while you're in the net

okay uh all right eleven okay now you

can either roll yep you do damage than

that really a damage okay I rolled a two

by the way good Oh

backstop my damage though 11 okay you

slash a hole through the net and it's no

longer a barrier and that's not good

cut that out and make it up alright so

to terrorise flying above mm-hmm and

strict surrounded by monkeys yeah my

make-a-wish tricks okay you run towards

tricks one by you can slide your way in

yep of course alright alright what's up

guys meet your friend

hey what's going on has been--

I missed you guys guys hey guys I just

went to the twitch page just so I can

watch it again all right now Wamba

correct me if I'm wrong but yeah are you

on the back of one of these things yeah

sure I'm on Terry Tara Tara Tara

all right yes so one baa is this little

goblin is riding on the back of one of

the big Tara folks and I'm saying hey

guys you remember me

no one's respond when she respond do you

remember me you were the guys that

killed my brother you can't you killed

him is that stricken womba womba you

call these dinosaurs and monkeys off

right now this is not funny yeah what

the heck man okay

you see strikes just like throw up a

little when he says hey evil ones like

waiting for him to do it yeah no I'm

gonna stay up here but monkeys just sit

there all right

the monkeys will cast a baleful glare up

at the Goblin and Wamba a persuasion

intimidate to check intimidation check

if you prefer that's a 19 oh my god

alright alright strix you see the

monkeys they're about to they're like

opening their mouths about to eat you

and then one but it falls them down

they're like she's like just so

exhausted she's like okay alright one

but do you want to do anything else you

haven't really taken much of an action

yet just hang it out for now do you say

anything to those other dinosaurs

I mean they're nice I just cannot just

fly around for just this chill just talk

to them I almost want to talk to them

excellent okay then evylyn what would

you like to do I'm gonna hold action and

let him talk okay and I'm gonna say this

is a disgusting burn drawing that you've

made and I find it distasteful but if

you want to talk then talk what do you

have to say well I was supposed bad

about it

my mom always said I was good at art

what is it you wanted to talk about

goblet all right let me just I'm gonna

float down okay Flint float down to the

ground

okay flow oh no no no my terror focus

mean yeah is terrible to my land and

then all right and I just wanna walk up

to 2df right I just I just really needed

to talk to you guys make an attack role

against the ethnic 14 hold on did you

add your strength bonus if you have

I probably don't really do I - 113 I

catch his dumb little rich even with

like my low strength and noodle arms I

stop him all right

yes your dick punch is blocked as soon

as he does that I hate on him just to

have him suspended floating alright

levitate looking up the spell here it is

actually Paul Finn's turn so um

do

yes unwilling an unwilling creature gets

a constitution saving throw would you

want to be levitated Wamba yeah sounds

of fun

alright in that case your spell does

take hold and one Bob begins to float up

into the air alright and you can write

you can raise him on this turn up to

twenty feet I want to raise him just

high enough so his legs can't actually

reach the ground but not high enough oh

I see okay so he's like a foot above the

ground

alright this is fun

yeah okay so he is hanging there in

front of DF now his little feet swishing

in the empty air dragons ain't you

wanted to do something go for it

dragon bait tool let's see EDF was off

heading towards Strix dragon bait we'll

just stay next to waffles and look

around way all right

and then it is Strix is turn nice now

right there they're not attacking they

will greedily take your snacks you like

snatch them out of your hand okay

alright and death what do you want to do

you go front of you yes Wamba what the

hell is this all about bored are you how

you killed my brother

oh yeah you also killed my brother I

forgot about that no really I just asked

him you really want to do that dude yeah

I mean I I listen it here's the thing so

what was that hey trash one what's

trash ones name her name is Strix not

that that straight Striz the the the

broom you have right think about it just

level with me empathy i know it's

difficult for you so when you left

through that portal you could have left

with someone your back right fair and

you didn't need your broom to do that

did you you you bailed your maybe talk

are you just ignoring me drinks listen

here uses feeding your knees straighten

Strix is literally over at your monkeys

feeding them okay two million a little

closer you actually you actually have no

you have no propulsion just got like

fold his arms i splay i do it whistle to

my tariffs oh you do have your brother's

whistle yeah the fart whistle so he

comes and gets me and helps me okay yes

terry you see the pterodactyl who landed

come gala just sort of stomping over on

its big clawed feet toward the goblin on

one buzz turn and yeah he gets over to

the Goblin and can probably grab the

goblin for his action yeah could you

just like carry me under his arm yeah

like that yeah thank you

yeah does that break the levitation okay

no paltin would have to end

concentration on it or you'd have to

break his concentration

so like the guy the terror folk is

holding him under his arm but can't pull

him away you know he can move he can

move the one ball around that's not a

problem on the ground correct yeah all

right and so yes the terror Foulke has

Wamba under its arm almost like a teddy

bear and then the other one overhead

shrieks out in frustration that this is

this plan was botched it doesn't feel

good does it

alright and then

the one in the air

Terrance I said his name is Terry and

Terrance yes do they both start with P

potentia before we do if P is silent

Batarian patterns

I noticed paltin say that like do you

really want to do this dude and I I was

starting to feel bad because like you

know he says we killed his brother we

abandoned him and I was like what do you

mean do what what does he want to do on

me no tip Alton oh oh sorry I didn't

seem to know something that we didn't uh

does he wanna tussle what what is what

is what I was getting at tussle

no don't what don't don't

I think you know judgment when you some

think what you saw what do you think you

saw what you saw your your judgment was

clouded so here

hear me out you were a cloud even you

might have seen things differently we

were we actually fell off that and it

was an accident and and I was I would

look here's the thing

I didn't finish I'm trial it you just

wait

you've not your turn I'm gonna talk to

this lady I get to the bottom of this

and figure out why Samba is dead and I

am grieving sir

you show some gosh-darned respect I look

at evil I'm like well he seems to be

more open about it than I am so maybe to

ask him alright the best episode - the

worst episode the the next turn comes

around and that would be let's see d/f

says so she still started floating like

tear tear tear it doesn't matter what I

was holding on to him Terry is holding

on to him and Terrence is floating and

flying up above okay Wamba yes we didn't

kill your brother

have no reason to circumstantially you

did what the hell does that even mean

well let me talk to the witch lady I'm

doing try to walk over there I feel like

you guys keep interrupting me he's not

super chatty today just a heads up I

don't think I want you near her

why are you like dating or something

what's going on no no no wait wait why

do you get to decide that I don't want

you to near anyone that's mean and fair

Alana's getting really confused so she

just like she sees that one was heading

Chris tricks and she just goes to be

like basically escorting him like she

positions herself so that he's never

between her and strix does that makes

sense

yes okay got it well I'm not gonna punch

a dick so you are escorting Terry and

Wamba toward strix and I I don't know

how much I can like hold action but if

he if he lays a finger on her or does

anything that I perceive as an attack

I'm ready to go okay cuz I'm like meters

away just saying arms I'm a goblin I'm

holding action and the trigger is him

doing anything aggressive toward my

party

alright paltin what would you like to do

how far is how far is he from strikes Oh

about 60 feet and how far am i from

strikes um probably about 70 feet okay

it's a conversation not a battle god I

mean now that attitude I'm gonna I'm

just gonna see what I'm gonna see where

this goes I'm just gonna like ready for

whatever so it sounds like nobody is

really engaged in the battle at this

point we can kind of initiative Wamba we

had no reason to actually kill your

brother reeling me or otherwise One Bowl

was I'm sorry chamba y'all look the same

chumba was a was a kind retainer to our

friend umbral and we would

never ever do anything that would upset

her or take that away from her because

they were good friends and we respected

that

okay hypothetical I'm ready okay you are

on a cliff side right right okay and the

cliff starts to break like office to the

ocean okay okay and these constricts

hear this she doesn't hear it yeah okay

so you're on you're on a cliff right and

also in the cliff starts breaking

everyone on the cliff all of us in the

cliff you walk away right you know then

someone's like please help me and you

don't and then you leave two people with

you and one of you had like like cool

like a like a cool wagon for like go car

for one of us to get away and right but

you didn't give us that cool go-kart and

then you just left and like we're our

legs are too small we can't get over

there and then we had to scamper like

for you to fight for our life like this

we had no choice like hey is this

hypothetical building up to how you use

your brother's body to break your phone

[Laughter]

because you took the broom that you

didn't need to teleport out which we

could have used to escape but you left

us to die you're not gonna leave your

friends on a cliff edge that's about to

break off in at the ocean there to die

that's insane is happening strikes can

hear this now are they closed

yes absolutely she's just like it's like

on the plane when like a kid is

screaming turns around like really

slowly into those I don't want to talk

to you

[Laughter]

all right so goblin piece of is

there anybody else beside the Goblin

that you want to be affected in the

blast because you start out first you

can get the terrible monkeys for now

because I feel like we had a rapport

okay as the fireball engulfs the Terra

folk kind of tucks one but under its

wing to protect him as much as possible

so I'm going to give you advantage on

your dexterity saving throw but me

yep so make it big steady saving throw

world to D 20s and take the higher

result and then are add your dexterity

bonus Terra folks gonna get half or 13

that's not enough and the Terek the

Terra folk also failed its save so

you're both gonna take full damage from

the fireball what does main india

facility just enter like this is an

explosion of fire it's called random

what he knows what's happening he's just

unfazed by it okay 29 damage okay so

you're at zero unconscious body with my

line just like one button floating one

but is down the Terra folk is down and

they're both sort of in a smoldering

heap surrounded by all the rest of you

guys and now we need to roll initiative

again because the monkeys go insane and

so does Terrance also for the record for

the record I did maintain concentration

so his unconscious body is still

floating

so initiatives for everybody including

you wumbo because you know you could

roll a 20 on your death save me oh my

God if you freaking wakes up I swear to

God

18 18 18 4 1 by anybody else

14 13 for df8 14 was 40s 14 for DIA 12

first Rix Holton 12 okay and we'll

assume Holdenville first and drying of

eight rolls a natural one okay so the

first to go is one by one by you can

make a death save it's just a d20 d20

roll add nothing to it okay excellent

so one but you awake with one hit point

and it's the end of your journey I

immediately like concentration so he

follows the same yeah so then okay so

you are conscious Tarrant's up above is

going to dive down and attacks oh gosh

[Laughter]

okay palton you are the one who is dived

toward by this aerial tara folk mmm so

he's going to make first of all a bite

attack against you and miss then he is

going to make two attacks with his claws

and one of the misses and one of them

hits you

Alton and paltin you take four points of

damage from the claw and you are

frightened in terror from it

oh and palton you're gonna end

concentration on your spell right

you know okay so you have to worry about

that and one but just sort of tumbles

down onto the burnt corpse of the burnt

corpse of Terry and that is the Tara

folk Strix you've got four of these

monkey creatures around you we had a

rapport you did this is why they're not

going to attack you they're going to

bound past you and over me and attack

your friends so one of them is going to

come after DF and make two attacks one

with its bite and one with its claws all

right it's going to hit the earth with

its bite and it does four points of

piercing damage okay you gonna can you

dodge that

did you already roll for their attack or

not yet I only rolled for one okay

I'll just take the four okay the second

one will attack you as well

miss you with its bite and hit you with

its claws okay it's claws do six

slashing damage uncanny dodge okay so

you take three it's my levitation stuff

gone yeah okay because politics ruined

gotcha

the third one attacks you is well DF but

misses completely the fourth one leaps

at evylyn and tries to bite and claw her

but misses both camps which brings us to

DF DF you've got three of these monkey

creatures on you I I'm not near enough

to any allies am i you are like within

10 feet of evylyn okay mmm it's not

quite good enough yeah I'll just sort

out and I'll just try to engage with the

monkeys and okay the really so I keep

them focused on me until you Berlin

intervenes got it

okay so I'll state an attack on one okay

23 oh yes good for

a whopping you know six damage okay you

stab at it you leave it a gaping wound

and it shrieks madly at you good monkey

yeah these guys don't look like they're

hard to hit there and then unarmored

basically they don't have their

dexterity bonus and so next up is paltin

paltin yes you've got a big 10 foot tall

tariff oh man trying to kill you that's

scary

yep what do you do and you're frightened

of it which means you are disadvantaged

on all kinds of stuff cool while

frightened you have disadvantaged own

ability checks and attack rules while

this creature is within your line of

sight cool

I'm going to go invisible then you want

to stay where you are though nope

so you gonna pull away yeah okay and are

you trying to get closer to your other

friends or farther away from the danger

where are those uh creepy monkey folk

one of any one of them sprung up to try

to attack evylyn and missed and then

three of them are ganging up on DF oh oh

kind of make my way toward the ganging

up okay

the terror folk next to you will make an

opportunity attack it can't see you but

it knows what square you're leaving so

it has a disadvantage on its attack role

and it misses you it swishes with its

claws misses and you get away and next

to DF I give it like an invisible like

yep it fails to see that but it feels

good Deborah the last trick I know strix

you just lit off a fire ball what do you

want to do again okay so are you

attempting to get womba womba in the

live terre folk or the monkeys no you

know what i

I don't think she's gonna get manga but

waa-waa-waa because like I feel like

there's other things that the party

wants to ask him and he's like

practically dead anyway so she's gonna

get the tera folk in the monkeys if you

can only get that you can only get one

or the other one the tariff okay monkeys

okay sure

great you can hit all four monkeys they

will make their saving throws presently

Strix help me get these monkeys off my

back I don't actually say that alright

so Strix

rule your damage the three monkeys on DF

all failed they're saving throws the

one-on-one six years I've hired the

worse people yeah they're they're not

rolling too hot on the frame there saves

anyway this seems to be par for the

course so far 39 okay alright alright so

the one on evylyn is badly badly burned

the other the other three are all dead

so as the fire sweeps around UDF you see

the monkeys just get turned to blackened

bones good alright I'm also gonna make a

poignant look at Wamba and go don't you

dare run alright I say well maybe you

should talk to me first I didn't even

hear that alright and Wamba don't forget

you do have another Ally Oh who's the

other way you're a demon oh yeah wait do

I have to cast that or is it already

near around its I'm sorry can it fly

mm-hmm oh all right I'll see let me

double-check that let me double-check

that yes guys Wamba gained a level of

warlock three down

actually you know it it doesn't fly so

it's probably been riding on Terrance's

back but it's invisible so you can do

what everyone ok so question if I tell

parents to do something is that gonna

take up my turn

No okay so I'm gonna say could you throw

the demon thing like at at one of them I

don't care anyone just whichever ones

easiest and then with that and I also

say also spit on the robot and then I

say with that I go like yeah and I

throat I just visible and then walk it

to the bushes hold on yep okay so after

Strix threatens you

evylyn what do you want to do I seed him

some in this demon right no you call out

to somebody to unleash the demon okay so

I don't know the demon is coming yet so

then I just think we're fighting these

silly little paper monkeys and yeah

there's one costing you yeah evylyn is

like we just killed him mercy killer

this is laughable and she just kind of

takes like a nonchalant like don't swing

with tree bein at this monkey and she

gets 22 that's a hit and she does 11

damage you decapitate the monkey and the

second attack and I haven't moved yet so

I can move to make this attack right

yeah there are no monkeys on DF there

are no more please period and there but

this tip there's one there's one tariff

oak left does it look like it's still

being aggressive or like it's gotta be

retreating no it looks aggressive she

kind of gives a like oh well and just

like those

him with she's like she's acting like

she's just bored by this mischief but I

think she probably misses she only gets

him 10 that is a miss she she tries to

make it look though like she like didn't

have to miss you know she's like she

goes and kind of like whips by him and

she's like next time it connect mm-hmm

all right at that point in time even you

are startled when a tiny demonic

creature that looks like this hey I know

him new it appears or basically comes at

you leaps off of the Terra folk onto you

and tries to rake you with its tiny

little claws and it rolled a 16-2 hit

which is not enough nope to claw through

you're trying to call me and I just put

one of my braces up and is like and

Terrance before he can lunge into battle

dragon bait comes up behind him and

tries to run him through hitting him

twice so the first one you just see

Terrance kind of buckle as dragon bait

whacks him on the back with his sword

yeah and then for his second attack

dragon bait brings the sword around

plunges it through the Tara folks back

and the end of the sword comes out

through its chest oh nice

and Terence falls dead at the dragon

baits feet all right good you killed my

brother and now you're killing my

friends you guys are the worst

all right and that's it for him so Wamba

as you look a big shadow falls over you

as you're lying on the ground and you

turn invisible

and the shadow looming above you is the

owl bear watch you crawl on this mouse

this is so mean bullies I didn't even

want to fight in our chat understands

psychological manipulation and will not

fall for your all right so waffles has

disadvantage on its attack rolls on her

attack rolls but nevertheless she can't

see you can't see him yeah you got his

waffles oh yes she has a lot she has

keen sight and smell so she's going to

yeah she rolled in 18 and 99 die for her

wisdom perception check so she kind of

knows where Wamba is and she will make a

beak attack against Wamba she was a 16

on the die plus subtlest 23 all right

Wamba you are scooped up in the Albers

mouth you take ten points of piercing

damage which drives you don't say huh

yeah so you're back you're back at zero

and then she will sort of use her claws

to kind of rend you to pieces so now you

have a deaf you have one death saving

throw failure one failure but one but I

got a few wakes up again one ball I'll

let you make another death save right

now mates it's a decent d20 roll Oh ten

you're good that's that's fine that's

your second success sorry that's right

first success yes yeah so you have one

success in one failure but this is gonna

end well for you I can already tell so

one but is unconscious there are no

other active threats DF it's your turn

what do you want to do do I see waffle

is yeah you see there's not waffle

chewing on some visible he oh that's a

good question

no because he's unconscious he would be

visible his spell would go down alright

so you see waffles nying on Wamba I see

no reason to interfere

Poulton I mean I'm not gonna be the one

to say something like standing looking

around like a listlessly and going yeah

she's standing in the blackened bones

she's like just having a conversation

with the dead monkeys alright and oh I

forgot the closet yeah well you know

it's just knowing on evil ins bracer

right now that's fine we you know and

watch and enjoy the beautiful circle of

life as it takes place before our very

eyes

evylyn what do you want to do demon on

you

oh yeah I want to do like part of this

is just to look cool for one but like

just to a little well either way like

this is a demon and evylyn wants to

assert power over a demon because she's

just appalled that any demon would have

the gall to attack a servant of Lysander

so she casts command and she just says

down alright let me just quickly check

the command spell it has to succeed on a

wisdom saving throw or follow the

command alright has no effect on them

dead or if it doesn't understand your

language which it does because we're

saying in the common so you're good and

it has to make save you throw what's the

DC okay it failed so it hops down I'm at

I like to imagine that it's like like

compels you know the power of what the

ender compels excellent yes anyone's

just standing over it with her acts just

like excellent cool

all right you have quelled this beast

for the time being this demon is now

convulsing before you Oh beating itself

and then we come to the dragon bait

who's not gonna do anything at this

point in time and then it is the albers

turn the albear will continue to chop on

Wamba and swallow him dealing out to

death saves failures this time and Wamba

disappears down its gullet wait right

before that happens even though he's

unconscious

Diaz actually like step up to waffles as

she's eating and as it's happening she

just you'll see if des just go

and then after that happens waffle spits

out of boot all right and the demon is

still convulsing and bowing before you

but the command isn't going to last

forever you know that it just last one

turns yeah they it doesn't get its next

turn and then I just proceed with

smashing it make an attack roll a lot of

look under compels you I miss just the

sex in the ground as it leaps out of the

way she's feeling overconfident so she's

like a lot of land it's like a pet I

mean she tries again okay

that's him she gets a 17 that is going

to hit and she's of course going to use

divine smite oh dear

sander compels you blah blah blah so she

gets three plus one is four okay plus 8

is 12 plus what's she casting this at

one let's make it two so 18 and 24 yes

it is a thing it is a fiend so one more

it's 29 so just a lot Alexander compare

I mean all right yes you smash it smash

it there's an explosion as it just

bursts like a balloon full of black

kicker and like yes and light and the

light just sort of burns the IKAR as it

flies up in the air yeah there's only a

momentary scream and then it's gone

missing

as you obliterate it in that moment

Strix yes

falls unconscious in the ground and then

the ground

by out of the road so like pick up the

nikkor she was just getting it out goes

and as she falls down the ground around

you in the entire jungle begins to

tremble and then a crack opens in the

earth right now around you know and this

sort of stretches and breaks the earth

for about fifty feet and then the earth

begins to peel back and roll aside as

it's almost like the earth is opening a

gigantic mouth oh my god guys he was

really important can I help her please

this is my final form no kidding yeah so

uh let's see that was uh Nibelungs turn

so yeah I was the planet when Cuomo's

affirmative as the ground begins to

break and split a gigantic serpent with

purple black scales erupts from the

earth and rises up into the sky and it

is so tall by the dress by the time it

gets up to its full height it is looming

about 80 feet above you its mouth is

about 20 feet wide and half of its body

is still underground Oh God so this

black serpent now leering down upon you

as it emerges and that's all it can do

this round which brings us to ZF what do

you do

where's tricks she is lying close by and

you can see that she's sleeping oh my

god I immediately just died for her grab

her and like I said pick her up you

gotta shake your livers likes tricks

wake up come on as I'm like kind of

taking her away from this massive

serpent okay

waking up Strix you can make a this will

be a constitution saving throw 19 holy



so dear that's great so actually 21 woo

well um dia as you shake her she wakes

up and as she does the gigantic serpent

goes and then just disappears into vapor

what

I'm sure he's final even was like even

saw this coming I she was like it's

Dender it's time to go and she was like

getting all holy ready like it's time

I'm gonna fight it whatever gender is

and then all of a sudden poof he's gone

and she's like and looks like strikes

this strike she's like she's just like a

sleep-like miss link and if she looks up

and sees it it yeah you see this sort of

just this kind of cloud just cooperating

ether essentially it's lost all

substance and form the DF is still like

holding strict at this point and just

kind of not moving assuming like some

other attack is about to happen is she's

just asleep again okay explode geez leo

right after that thing like it

dissipates sorry to disturb you said

you're going asleep it goes okay we

didn't see what it was she just saw a

cloud so she probably does go to sleep

again strictest nods off again it reco

alessa's yeah alright let's continue on

shall we

alright okay so next Paulson so right as

that happens yeah I like I like turn to

evylyn and I point I'm like hey you want

your God to be compelling do like

[Laughter]

you praise and end our did not doubt I

can respect that

alright this makes evil and very pouty

paltin would you like to do anything

else because you're still technically

I'm an action hide as okay no right

and you're still invisible so yeah you

can easily move away swims strix it is

your turn you can attempt another

Constitution save at the end of your

turn to wake up again

please wake up okay you remain asleep

yes alright

evylyn you are up I look at death and I

say let her sleep and then I cast

compelled duel on the snake thing what

you will fight me and only me and you

shall be smoke from the face of the

earth by this ancient bound servant of

the holy morning Lord you're trying to

fight a god it's like I feel like

there's at least three more things you

could do before that I want to compel

the door and then she's gonna rise up in

in in the air with her boots and she's

gonna use all her movement to try to

like draw him away with her in this

compelled duel away from her companion

okay Ross making a saving throw for me

on the Serpent's behalf on the serpent

stuff yeah you could roll a different

dice that'd be great

yeah 11 okay it fails at saving throw

and is compelled by your spell even you

will not hurt my friends and she starts

to like the big giant serpent fik just

turns its head and fixates was

fluttering little constructs

alright paltin sees this happens just

like ah man this is a good anime

all right your concern paltin you tell

what would normally be one was turn is

now this dendara stern ross make an

attack role against evil in for me just

roll the deep my frickin God I'm sorry

here we go d 20 and tell me what you get

to yes it lunges with its jaws at you

evil in but you nimbly get out of the

way I'm trying to have yeah yep it is in

that red and next is DF Woodrow you see

evylyn has got dendera the night

serpents undivided attention you get her

to safety uh it's like a stupid of an

idea that this is I actually like fully

believe in trust and evil and in this

and I like I know this is this goes

beyond just protection mm-hmm

yeah like I'll carry Strix and I try to

like get closer to the jungle or

something or to the edge of the jungle

especially yeah a little more cover um

the view of this serpent thing okay and

just like continue to hold her like I

guess I like kind of get behind a tree

and I kind of set her down I kind of

rested up against it yeah you can see

she's sound asleep

yeah that way I could try to like

monitor what's happening out there but

also keep watch on her okay and you can

hear the sound of the big serpent kind

of moving through the trees chasing

after evylyn and next up is o dragon

bait he is gonna come over to you as

well d EFT and just check on Strix to

make sure she's okay okay and then it's

so nice yeah and then and waffles will

just stay where she is and digester meal

[Laughter]

alright and so it is Paul toons turn

paltin you are not in any imminent

danger it looks like the snake is going

tell Mel

toward evylyn so I've picked I've also

picked up that she's like bringing it

away yeah she's basically compelled it

through the power of faith alone into a

duel to the death how far are they from

me the the serpent is about forty feet

away from you Evelyn's probably about

sixty feet away from you okay I just

call out to her real quick

it's like yeah do you know what you're

doing

no but Lysander sure does yourself safe

you go find ya okay all right that's nod

to death wander off into the brush not

too far away I hear like I hear you say

not really I'm like okay well that's

enough and I'm gonna give her some

Bartok inspiration this is going on

gender is still coming up out of the

ground there seems to be no end to how

long this snake is oh my god

stupid and it is Strix astern so you

play me a song right like you yeah

that's a chick mandolin Jam say Ethan's

like she looks all intentional she hears

that and then her eyebrows her and she's

like oh yeah like she gets super super

rock Drex you get a saving throw at the

ANU tree I got 19 again okay you

suddenly wake up it might have been the

mandolin music that you can't stand but

you wake up and as you do the serpent

begins to essentially disintegrate and

evil and as you watch it it it as it

lunges and dodges toward you it just

becomes sort of this cloud in this

ephemera that just sort of dissipates

into nothingness she she wants to look

like she's disappointed but she's kind

of like

[Laughter]

and my you do I notice tricks waking up

at this point yes am i evil you also two

together also see the big snake

disappear yes you think that it is Strix

is nightmares that fuel this thing's

existence oh my that sounds like the

most powerful thing ever

yeah and it's okay she just needs to be

in a mentally stable state all the time

she needs to sleep so that she doesn't

have nightmares like this came far side

bang so you think it might like to sleep

you think this has to be has to have

something to do with then our den DARS

relationship with Wamba the warlock

you're not sure Wow it would be cool to

keep him alive huh is not like that guy

but they're all you also might be on

desecrated ground because there's a big

symbol of dengar burning yeah I guess we

should leave alright I just was quiet

and even as you flutter back to the

clearing the whole that den dark came

out of isn't there it's like it never

appeared can I get any sense whether

through my divine sense or normal

perception or like religion or anything

like that of whether I think he was

really there or whether this could be

some sort of like apparition go ahead

and make a religion check religion 14

you think of having witnessed what you

see and now looking at the ground and

seeing its undisturbed apart from the

burnt symbol that what you saw was

purely an apparition and brought into

being by some force you don't think it

would have been is not a real been dark

but it could have really done damage in

it in that form gotcha and do I does

even perceive a connection between

strictest nightmares and the it's more

like if it's the combination of somebody

falling asleep in the stereo that is

that Wamba basically consecrated to his

God

all right she comes back and she kind of

feels a little sheepish now that she

sees this hole isn't even there yeah and

she kind of reconnects with death and

paulten and Strix and she's like that

wasn't the real den door and in fact it

wasn't a real anything I mean it could

have done some real damage to us but I

can tell now from these ritual symbols

and what I remember from Dondarrion

symbols class that uh but I think we

need to leave from here and once we do

what we find why do you sound

disappointed

I mean I just I I kind of made a silly

thing of myself if I you know thought

that was the real den dar and you know

tried to take it on but it was really

just kind of a smoke signal thing oh

I'll take feeling silly over feeling

dead hater evylyn does the bravest thing

I've ever seen in my entire life don't

ever doubt yourself like hands on

shoulders restricts like strikes we need

to get out of here can you can you stay

with us yeah just come on we'll help you

along the way but you have to get out

here you have to go here let me carry

her she picks her up okay okay if you

have trouble staying asleep I have

bagpipes positive you better play

something while we walk that's more

that's kind of bouncing her like don't

fall asleep don't fall asleep and I'm

behind just like

every every dinosaur in the jungle now

knows where you're going that's fine all

right

yes and you make your way along waffles

pulling up the rear and then later on

after you long after you've left this

scene and you're sort of settling down

you you camp and rest and take a short

rest or whatever - okay recover your

points is it is it likely enough at

night that we like take a full rest or

actually maybe you'll be able to take

the fall you'll be able to camp for the

night come on I recover hip points for

sleeping in the digestive system

in fact the following morning as

everybody breaks camp and head back to

oral Unga waffles has a big and mighty

poo and left behind in the pool saving

throw are little bits of Wamba and his

petrified Mouse trinket and his brothers

whistle stuck in the poo now it's a

whistle ken Ken waffles attempt to dab

and then as waffles finishes or poo

somebody from the party says oh and she

goes crumpling off into the jungle and

that's where we'll stop for tonight

leaving behind a little pile of

that you are can't believe we got to

kill Ross twice yeah so thank you very
