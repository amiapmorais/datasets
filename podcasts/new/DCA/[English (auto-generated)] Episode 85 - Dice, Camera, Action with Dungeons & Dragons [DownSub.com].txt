[Music]

[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action all right yeah where some of us

are coming back from conventions and are

really exempt some of us are feeling ill

some of us have you know all kinds of

sicknesses and bugs that were spreading

around but we're here but Anna's fine

you know it's in the forest

she's fine no waterfall and it sprayed

on my face and cleanse me I'm just like

I'm full of Pacific Northwest energy

which is my life force so even if I were

sick and tired and stress yeah so Anna's

carrying this episode yeah because like

we would be sick and tired absolutely

makes a lot of sense method acting

all right previously in the waffle crews

adventures DF strix Evelyn chased their

good friend palton across the shadow

fell to stop him from making a horrible

mistake and using the ring of winter to

bring forth a new Ravenloft domain for

which he would be the Dark Lord as

expected things did not go according to

anybody's plan and in the midst of the

snowy chaos the ring of winter

disappeared and it's not altogether

clear what happened to it

either strix Evelyn DF nor palton were

evident or really in a position to

determine what happened to the ring at

the time it disappeared

it simply seemed to vanish from Paul

Tain's hand along with a woman whom DF

and Evelyn aren't sure was really with

the party at anytime in the shadow foul

Strix however does does Ken affirm that

there was an elf in the party named

Miranda and she

he seems to have disappeared at the same

time the ring did along with two shadow

kai assassins also gone is Avis tani

wagon that Strix is half brother Isaac

arrived in Isaac is still with the party

the two Borromean guard sir a woman died

at the hands of Paul tins ice soldiers

as did the faceless Avenger Lord nyle

apparently so

where do we stand the waffle crew is

standing outside the smoldering wreckage

of the Dead I'd drunk tavern which Strix

reduced to its foundations turned into a

smoldering pile ball magic so that thing

is still kind of giving off billowing

clouds of smoke

palton zeiss army is now derelict they

seem to have lost the magic that once

animated them and so these ice

sculptures apalta nor ever where one is

missing its face because paltin slammed

his tankard across it and three of the

four members of the waffle crew are

currently suffering from various kinds

of despair and paltin is despairing for

reasons of his own

so with that normal despair yes with

that

what's all happening to you guys you

said Lord and I all got killed he you

see his prostrate body on the snowy hill

his sword lying nearby ice sculptures of

paltin some of them decapitated some of

them broke and others intact but falling

over all around him even goes to inspect

him okay when you do you see that there

are broken off ice blades stuck in his

body here there and everywhere or sorry

through his clothes but when you inspect

him more closely you see that his armor

his cloak and his burlap hood have

nothing

in them it's just empty clothes DoDEA

wasn't real was there a person wearing

these things you sort of hold up the

empty garments for all to see no I don't

think so

I guess not yeah that's so weird that a

suit of armor would just kind of I don't

know she kind of is just like scratching

her head looking at it like she's trying

really hard to understand it is there

anything valuable like a weapon of his

that we might want to take no in fact

his he was fighting with a longsword

that looks like it was quite ancient and

corroded if I see them looking at the

body I'll just like shuffle over there

and see if see if there's any magic

going on you don't see any magic around

Lord Nile I would also be remiss in not

pointing out one other creature who is

present with the Wafaa crew and that is

the big rotting zombie ogre that's

attached to the shadow Kai's abandoned

coach and the coaches you recall is a

rundown old jalopy with a bunch of

crossbow bolts sticking out of it at odd

angles does that creature and look like

it's hostile or just hanging out it's

just hanging out it's this sort of blue

blueish gray zombie with parts of its

skin peeled off where you can see sort

of underneath bone and sinew

it's obviously sort of been out in the

cold for a long time which explains its

color of the fact that scuffs are got a

frosty coating and in place of one of

its one of its arms which has chopped

off at the elbow there is a large iron

meat hook all right I know I'm just

gonna can I do maybe like if you just

walk up to that thing and just kind of

like maybe put a blanket over it if it

looks a hold okay yeah kinda have to

climb up on okay couch alright coach and

sort of throw the blanket up over it and

shoulders which sort of covers just the

head and shoulders okay I'm just gonna

say your name is hooky the third and

you're gonna be

a okay you're a pet now it doesn't react

to you in any way okay I'm on top of it

just petting his head okay

Trix is not a bad day you can see one of

the coach side doors is kind of hanging

open as well oh cool I'll go inspect the

inside then okay you can see as you look

inside there are two benches that face

each other one at the front one at the

back the one of the benches has been

thrown up upward and left open revealing

a compartment anyone in the bench

compartment as you look around you can

see a few stray gold coins and nothing

else looks like it's been emptied I

don't know what those are for cuz we

don't have any money

okay when you take one of the coins and

you lift it up you can see it's got the

profile of strawed of course on it I

don't want it anymore the other coins

the other coins appear to be different

like they came from somewhere else okay

I leave the strawed one they take the

other two about to uh who was closest to

me right now what are you guys doing Ian

Halton kind of wandered down the hill

about D F followed after paltin with

Simon as you recall and kind of reunited

paltin and Simon all right well if no

one's there then I'll just I'll keep

looking around for something my goal is

to find some kind of way to get out of

here like if I could do an arc on a

check or it find a portal key or

something I want to find a way out of

not just the shadow okay may I make an

Arcana check for me okay at one point I

was making a map was this worthless

because we were going for a while yeah

you do have a you you did attempt to

make a map charting your progress from

where you arrived in the shadow fell to

this place that map is still with you

okay I got that at least if we want to

get back to that spot is that I think

that's still where

maybe that took us days and who we'd be

dead but I got a 17 okay you don't see

anything here that would suggest there's

a shadow crossing but you know that in

general shadow crossings from the

Material Plane to the shadow fell are

most common in places where there has

been a lot of death okay where where the

dead are buried so cemeteries and

battlefields being great examples all

right great

okay is this a battlefield did we make

one a big one

all right one is just like she she took

the sword and like the helm and kind of

made like a warriors monument out of it

and now she's just like a sword with a

burlap sack with eye holes on it and

then she's just kind of walking the

ranks of the ice Pelton's and just like

staring at them thoughtfully okay if

those things like still just hanging out

or do they like melt or shatter or you

froze so there's it's it's still rather

cold here the ring of winters departure

did not change the temperature or the

climate at all so they're not going to

melt anytime soon but they are clearly

not animate anymore okay also death is

cold yes yes do you feel is that pretty

real yep yeah you do feel the cold and

so does paltin if strix notices they're

cold and she'll find blankets in the inn

and deliver everyone there's nothing in

the end Salvage do I have enough on me

to give everyone a blanket no you gave

your blanket to the the ogres ahhmm be

who needs at least and the the wind has

sort of changed a little bit so all the

smoke from the end is now blowing over

you strikes in the in the coach and over

the over the zombie because you're

actually you guys are actually right

we're right next to the end so it's it's

smoldering right right next to you all

right well while they're all doing that

I'm still gonna try and befriend this

ogre zombie and be like like

try and communicate be like do you know

where a lot of death is it looks like

you've experienced it a few times like

maybe is it this way and I like like not

if you're understanding I'm like waving

I got my staff as you're talking to it

and kind of tapping it with a staff its

attention and doing all that kind of

thing it does seem to acknowledge you it

kind of it almost sort of just kind of

wakes up okey uh was there any other

wagon or just the one that meathook is

up to just the one that meathook is lash

to the other vest on a wagon is gone and

you could actually see its tracks go off

down one of the roads in the that you

would have not yet traveled okay so is

the decrepit one does it look like it

still has enough wheels and axles and

things that it can function it it looks

perfectly functional it's got four

working wheels it's got a big lumbering

brute pulling it it looks like it could

go wherever you wanted to go assuming

you can get this thing to move yeah you

can see tricks up there talking to it

do you for like call up districts to

just be like do you know how to drive

that thing yeah I mean I've I've I I

spent 50 years riding around a wagon in

burrow via so I'm sure I can I don't

know about the zombie thing so Paulson

you have actually seen this coach role

because and you do recall that when

Murray Siana or levar doe wanted this

behemoth to go anywhere they shouted out

its name and said something else make an

intelligence check to see if you can

remember exactly what it's an Italian

[Laughter]

that's a 16 okay yeah you heard it

enough first of all they would always

call it meat hook and then usually they

would say something like on dare Avanti

gotcha so before palton conveys any of

this okay this whole situation an amount

of wine has left him feeling not so good

yeah and he is going to

and on that note I will return in a

minute okay so palton hurls all over the

snow and then he'll he'll probably come

to his senses enough afterward to tell

you that he heard the assassins say

andar Avanti when they wanted him to go

somewhere spree Gatti when they wanted

him to go faster and firm re when they

wanted him to stop all right spaghetti

to go faster got it spaghetti to go

faster not to be confused with the sorta

spaghetti which could all charters all

right

so and meet hook every named hooky but

I'll call him

meet hooky well I'll uh you know just

pet him and stuff and be like oh well

we'll be nicer to you so you can take us

where there's death right baby should we

follow their tracks here should we

follow these that would make sense but

they were evil mm hmm hmm

maybe they know the way out though

they're clearly not going the way you

came but direction doesn't matter here

oh I don't know I just want to leave I

hate this place does evylyn just find a

portal walking on the battlefield no

yeah strike says we'll look at evil an

idea they like yeah you guys are still

being barmy so we need to get out of

here uh just in a general I guess

mechanic fact fashion is it actually

faster to travel by meat wagon than on

foot

uh you have never seen me took walks oh

you have no idea okay

we asked me who's puking paltin will

tell you that meathook doesn't go

particularly fast probably about as fast

as a person walking maybe slightly

faster cuz he's got a wide stride but he

doesn't tire oh that's good

so we can go throughout the night so

Denver all together yeah he never has to

stop okay so why don't we all just take

this piece of and get out of here

one thing you do notice the earth is you

kind of poke around in the in the coach

is that because it does have its windows

broke a long time ago but at least

inside here you can kind of get out of

the wind oh I like that

I think closing myself off from this

world would be great okay

as soon as strict says that you guys are

barmy and we need to leave you know it's

kind of like okay okay so to be get in

the wagon

palton is still kind of out there

throwing up but Simon will kind of guide

him back toward the one you only exerted

the Athan is like does he look kind of

unwell do you I hope Simon was holding

his hair for the record oh yeah cause

it's all long and black as the Simon is

just sort of behind Paul and pushing him

by the bum toward the coach now when you

when you get in when you all sort of

pile into the coach Strix are you

staying up top

yeah it's all oh yeah and you've got

your robe sort of bundled all around you

because it is damn cold out here

yeah well I figure strictest clothes are

pretty warm weather

I mean cold weather appropriate she's

probably the probably one of the warmest

I can't feel temperature that's right or

cry yes yeah you think you think after

it'll you can probably hang out here for

quite a while Strix because you are

bundled up with your robes but after a

while it might behoove you to choose to

change reigns with evil and at some

point who

bothered at all by the cold then again

you also believe that the limit the

range of this winter because it was

created by the ring it might not go out

that far so maybe you'll get out of the

cold and things will be a little bit

more tolerable right well if they're in

the wagon and Strix will tell meathook

did she'll be like meat hug oh dear Bob

- okay all right good enough nailed it

yep he starts to lumber forward and

makes his musics with us - I forgot oh

yes what do you want to do with him love

him I'm gonna put him next to me on the

top okay on the top all right so strix

and isaac riding on top of the coach

evylyn deaath palton simon and be in the

coach and waffles just sort of trembling

behind it as you make your way from the

ruins of the Dead Eye drunk down the

hill toward the crossroads and from

there you're going in which direction oh

god I hate crossroads

it's a y-shaped crossroads the bottom

stem of the why seems to go south in the

direction you came and then the two

upward prongs of the YV are often

different in Northwest and northeast

strikes we'll stick our head in and look

at particularly to you and be like help

there's directions your map only tells

you what's to the south

yeah if you like take out the map and be

like this is where we came from that

took a month now that doesn't that month

of travel was like direct mm-hmm and

that's just because we were wandering

idiots right you were following a road

but yeah so there's no there's no real

way for us to oh expediate that i have

an idea okay idea okay is there anything

other than meat hook that around here

that looks like it might be dead like a

dead rat a dad something anything dad

will never know is buried under snow I

have a mummified ravenclaw on me

okay just a dead thing yeah Oh mommy

yeah I am going to fasten it on to my

staff okay and stick my staff in front

of meathook okay and have him smell that

raven foot okay smell smell the dead

raven foot yeah I'm gonna go go towards

that smell okay

when do you do that he proceeds in a

direction and it's not on any of the

roads all right yeah we're just bumping

all it basically goes up off the road

toward the east dewy all right and I'm

sort of making a mistake due west all

right I'm like this this is the best I

could do yeah and now you're just going

over rain all right I'm shaking it in

front of him like towards the death and

with the jostling ride palton is like

with Simon beside him and waffles

following after the coach I would

imagine

yes waffles is trembling behind the

coach now she will eventually tire and

will need a rest so as you make your way

through the snow over the hills and

dales over a rough terrain occasionally

you know the it seems like the coach

sort of falls out from under you as you

drop down suddenly and slam your butt's

on the the benches and occasionally

strix and eASIC are kind of listening to

the side and holding on to the Coach

handles for dear life as this thing

leads them away after about a half mile

or so or Mott will say a mile just to

keep it neat the snow begins to thin out

and you can see the edge of Paul tins

domain and beyond that is just this sort

of bleak rocky kind of north Scotland

little in the way of vegetation

wasteland with foggy patches everywhere

ah better or worse meathook avoid the

foggy patches okay

he doesn't seem to care he's just

following the heading toward death yeah

that's that's my column a little Raven

was just like what like swinging yeah so

like the usual for the wall yes hurtling

toward wind toward death literally I

just told him to hurtle towards the

entire trip yes

DF hates the fact that music and is out

there with tricks right now so were you

sitting in the wagon he keeps doing that

thing really like looks back up in like

their direction and kind of puts his ear

there just be like really talking about

what's going on there does satyrs are

talking at all no storks will definitely

try and talk to him and be land you know

just kind of be like please don't kill

my friends strict to make an insight

check that's an 11 okay you can nest

with that role you can discern two

things YZ ech is upset about something

it seems to me knowing at him his brow

becoming deeper and more furrowed the

longer this trip wears on to every time

DF kind of sticks his head out the wagon

he seems to kind of notice and it's

really starting to piss him off okay

gonna be like what is wrong with you do

you have definitely heard that it was a

scream right yes and then Isaac will say

they store my dolls oh that can't be it

can't be how would you like it if they

stole your dolls and he like reaches

into your robe grabs like just one of

your dolls and throws it I only have one

left did I see this yeah you see this

trick stall go into the dirt d 3 t like

dives out the wagon

that's your treason huh all right yes

you do you dive out of the wagon you you

scoop up the doll and you have it you

have a strict stall dear so strict sees

these DS like some guy like skittering

animal just like

yes artfully nimbly yes yeah she just

look at it like it ease it can be like

people can retrieve my dolls you needed

to make friends my friends are my family

that's because they're nice you've been

mean to our table too

if you're nice you can be part of our

family too I don't even hear is I

normally yes she looks at the earth and

she's like he's boisterous part of our

family boisterous are you talking about

that one boisterous after you even

points yes just like what no hell no no

no the evil is he bad is bad he's fair

bad I think he's is he attacking strikes

diesel poke you like head back out gonna

be like not physically I mean I've been

having a real hard time telling what's

real and what's not lately but I just

feel like maybe there's some Menace

oh me too oh me too

I don't like this guy at all should we

do something about it

I mean I've know I've been wanting to

since we saw I don't know palton should

we do something

but Poland's got his head out the back

window and he's just hurling

oh I know I'm supposed to roll my 50/50

chance of weather

oh yes tricks and strikes you're still

such sort of suffering under the effects

of the dread that you feel living here

which means anything that you see kind

of raises alarms yeah so you know every

few minutes you just hear ah objects

that don't don't mean you any harm start

to take on a dire countenance as you

gaze upon them even if they're like a

distant dead tree or some hill shape

that kind of looks like us the head of a

sleeping hag or something like that you

sort of personify all the objects around

you and make them

for boating occasionally however you do

see a sign of life and that usually

amounts to a single raven or crow

passing overhead and the way it kind of

does it sort of passes and then passes

again and flies back toward the north

almost like it was keeping its eyes on

you and that spins red in your mind as

well like what's this who's spying on

you why are they sending these

emissaries to chart your progress okay

you even see sort of over annum or what

looks like the ruins of a house that has

sort of tumbled down just leaving bits

of wall and perhaps part of a chimney

standing doesn't look like anybody's

lived in it for centuries

but the evidence that there are at what

there have been at one time people who

did build things and live out here

nothing on the scale of like a village

or a town just a stray building here or

there I hate this I'm just gonna pull my

my hood up over just like and I'm gonna

tell eat I'm gonna tell eASIC - he's

scaring me and I had to go on the wagon

no I don't want him next to me no I

don't want you next to me I don't care

why he says I've come a long way to find

you but you want to hurt my friends only

for what they put you through put me

through you were on one of them he's a

lord god ah what does that even mean

what does that even mean and then she

just like is still hiding whoa are they

the family that tried to destroy us us

I'm not even one of you I was dumped I'm

this is my family they're not my family

you can't be friends with him but if you

can't be friends that's unacceptable I'm

sorry and if you say that again you are

going to be walking with the owl bear

you can't you all of you see strix land

and then pick herself back up straighten

her hat and just with her handler

goes running madly was this him

threatening her with a weapon you're not

sure cuz you didn't see it you heard him

raise his voice at her and then she

jumped off and ran off the coach even

flies out the window of the coach what

does she see yeah as soon as you do you

see Isaac has sort of sort of stopped

grabbed on to the the reins to sort of

pull with all of his strength on me

Chuck just stop the wagon so it just

sort of comes to an abrupt stop and then

you see straight sort of running off

into the Moors she tackles eASIC off the

carriage to the ground okay just make a

this is a shove basically so which

doesn't happen often enough that I

remember how it works most Rick sees

evil and tackle him she'll stop running

and turn around I'd be like oh is a was

disabled that hear or see any of this as

well yeah okay you didn't see it jump

out of the wagon I'm probably running

gonna make an attack role evil and make

a strength exchange map lettuce Jack

slack buddy he did not real great I did

he's got a strength of 18 I got 22 okay

yes you knock him off the coach and he

lands and she sits on his chest like

straddles his chest and holds his

shoulders down okay yeah this this huge

man tries to pry himself up but can't

immediately get you be on top of it

death ahead it's like what also sprung

out of the wagon at this points and then

approaches Isaac in a position that easy

consider threatening all right you now

loom large over Isaac as he lies on the

floor with evil and on his chest paulten

you are now alone in the coach with

Simon and waffles behind here um I'm

gonna go out there okay everybody here

we go everybody is now out of the coach

which has come to a dead stop Strix

you've stopped and you turn around and

you can see evylyn sitting on e6 chest

it's probably late so it's the Sun what

not

the Sun but it's gotten it's a little

bit darker gray than it normally is out

here and and of course DF do you want to

do anything once you're standing on over

dia or over

Isaac I'm sorry not really dress him

correctly but it's kind of in general

just saying something along the lines of

like I knew it I knew it he's bad he's

people he can't be here still shuffle

shuffle up and be like while you're

while you're trapped on the ground I

would like to know everything you know

about the lore kapha

and the Skiz exploit el alive zone of

truth oh no but we're all standing here

yes you're always on a trend center of

evylyn all feel the zone how do you can

you resist the Sun of truth is that a

thing so yeah charisma so you are in

there we're all in it every year on a 50

foot 15 foot really yeah so Isaac music

will make her ISM a saving throw or

he'll try he's just - now what's the DC

Hannah let me but I think it's pretty

good 17 okay anybody else want to save

against the zone of truth so when a zone

of truth is cast is this yeah is there

like a an actual visual thing you can

see like a bunch of light coming out is

like something we can actually yeah you

can see a magical zone sort of expand

outward from evylyn and then it kind of

disappears and you don't see it anymore

I imagine that zone of truth

particularly looks like super high

contrast like in it makes everything in

super sharp relief where it comes from

like as though you're adding like a

black border on everything for a second

cool

Anna what's the radius of it 15 15 feet

from me radius okay see it doesn't want

to be in that zone or truth huh yep

Holly is suspicious death Allah tried to

read this one what's the DC nevermind 15

and then maybe just kind of nobody in

their party would have a problem with

telling the truth she thinks that's fine

music tell Strix no I'm nervous I'm not

saying anything with them around you and

I leave them behind I'll tell you all

you want to know all that she's not

going anywhere with you shut up I'm so

this on the truth so oh I want to hit

him to clarify his owner truth doesn't

force you to tell everything that you

say all right everything if you say

something it has to be nasty truth yeah

if you fail it Paulding and nosotras

just like I don't feel good I know no

one in this circle has any secrets right

yeah Isaac will say to Strix again I'm

not telling you anything while he's

around and he sort of points up if TF

dude he is our enemy he always has been

and he always will be can you tell me

why or we're gonna stab you or I'm gonna

burn you or he's gonna stab you he's

probably gonna stab you it looks like he

really wants to stab you Thor needs to

drink and then he also says he should be

dead I killed you

he says the death evylyn points like see

I'm sorry I'm sorry easy but you can't

kill him again in fact he's never going

to die again

none of them are he looks like well

other than unprecedented circumstances

yeah even looks at death and says you

have no idea what he's talking about

right I don't think so

[Applause]

I'm pecking my memory and evil evil oops

how said that they were angel people you

know it God

Diaz are they angel all I was told that

they were angel people I don't know what

the lore kata are all I know is that he

keeps saying saying it to me and I just

seems like something along the lines of

calling me a butthole I don't have our

economy Waveland Evelyn shouts it in the

lore Casas are people they're human

they're family that what and he's one of

them yes how do you mouth yeah cuz

that's weird cuz he just looks like a

person smelly hands like horns and I'm

like I'm a messed-up face like I do this

works is like pointing in herself and

he's like and he says I'm not saying

anything more oh my god fine you got it

oh I hate you I hate you so much I don't

want to be here anymore well exit at

least 15 feet away okay I kind of go

back to the wag and if it's far enough

out of earshot I mean back in the wagon

or something Ellen is is using like on

the ground right now

evylyn tackled him to the ground and

she's sitting on him okay wait why are

you leaving didn't you want to attack

him where are you going I'm gonna like

oh thank you sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna

like kind of just slum overs and then

just kind of like lay lay on him like

like a bro just like a head on like his

shoulder looking up at the sky alright

then your head is like right by my knee

that works and then I'm gonna drunkenly

try to persuade him be like come on man

you just hear and this Jill just make

things way easier and easy he's great

d if it'll be like back at the wagon

part enough away was just pacing back

and forth angrily okay the fact that

death is trying to stay that far out of

the zone of truth yes Rick says to it

she's like what is happening here oh

just get the information out of them

paltin you can make a persuasion check

but I'm gonna have to give you a

disadvantage because okay Isaac is

currently in a predicament that I mean

he's got evil and sitting on I meet

other people threatening himself okay

that would be a 12 okay he says yet I am

already unconscious

well Strix is gonna look at him in deal

and just unconscious palton on like the

cheek like it's okay buddy looks from

he's like who she's sitting on in

restraining to palton who is now

unconscious on music and back and she's

just like not sure what to do from here

like at this point music is going to try

to stand so he's gonna make another

strength check against you strength at

Lenox oh I only got ten okay you still

managed to hold him down so he sort of

kind of gets up and then you push him

back down by the shoulders don't

underground I I kind of want I want

Strix to kind of like hold her staff

down at his head okay and just go just

so the Crescent is kind of it yeah it's

like right as a neck and just say you do

not threaten them you tell me who these

families are and what they want or I

will take your head off and she's gonna

threaten him man the timid a check I'll

give you an advantage because yes evylyn

sitting on after after the years I tried

to get up from where death was he likes

omelet right you haven't even

restraining them so da it's just talking

to self just being like

try it try it and he is just basically

twirling a throwing dagger they put the

poison on oh man just at the ready nice

I roll the 26 oh all right

music tells me and he he's just he hates

to say the words but he just he tells

you because he he doesn't mind dying but

he doesn't want to be killed by his

sister and he tells you that some of so

the Skiz --ax and the lord katha are two

families that were largely based in a

faraway city he doesn't know what it's

called or where it is strikes will

inform him is called sigil okay he tells

you he tells you that they were they

were spread far and wide and they had a

lot of power and influence but the two

families hated each other and they hated

each other their blood has been spilled

for aeons between these two families and

there's no reconciliation possible but

he also tells you that some of the

schizos forged a pact with devils and

were turned into tea flings and with

their newfound power and their alliance

with Asmodeus sought to wipe the lord

kapha out which led to a great

multiversal conflict oh who did the lurk

- ally with fearing that they would be

annihilated they tried to form an

alliance with the devils ancient enemies

angelic beings from the plane of

something-or-other he doesn't know of

course this triggered a huge war that

killed millions evelyn was like why have

I never heard of this holy war if there

was a holy war I would have heard about

it he says

there a piece was forced upon the two

families and he all he knows is ad mode

Asmodeus had a hand in it

others had a hand in it Oh like the

actual yeah a lot of a lot of a lot of

very important cutters had a hand in the

crafting of this peace accord which was

called and he can't remember the exact

name but he thinks that he heard lady

Walker call it the Ashton concordance

why would it be called the Ashton

concordance yeah why would it be called

that because apparently it was signed in

a city or torment that got dragged into

hell called ash town

oh yeah she fine fine what a coincidence

cool yes and as part of the piece the

Lorca tha's had to give up their souls

to me as to Asmodeus except for one when

she shakes them I said that's the one he

did he he that's there's only one is

that how you knew that that's what he

was he doesn't know a whole lot more all

he knows is that lady walked her was was

always very interested in these stories

and these two families in fact she may

have a book or two that goes into detail

about these conflicts know that that guy

has a soul so it's unlikely that he's a

Lorca oh you must be mistaken

he just his eyes become black coals that

smolder hatred and death direction like

he just knows he just absolutely knows -

the way you're looking at him and I

think your story is whack or wait do I I

don't know what's real I think your

story has merit Strix Strix will take

her staff off off of him okay and say go

back to lady Wachter go back go find her

he says if you stay with him you'll

destroy everything I'm never leaving she

just like stamps her staff on the ground

you two can't be together oh she's just

staring at him she's not even gonna say

anything she's like go back to lady

boxer what do you mean they can't they

are he says the Ashton concordance

forbids it

a home looks at he's a queen goes but

dude that's all making the ship more

appealing why does he always say that

when he's drunk don't understand I don't

know just ignore him he speaks a

different language when he struck uh

wait so the Ashton concordance forbids

what exactly he doesn't say anything

more I don't like how you keep clamming

up right when you get to the good parts

he says no schisms knoll or kapha can

ever be together no friendship no

alliance nothing

well good thing that he's probably wait

maybe he is al or casas no Diaz are you

on or kapha jerks looks up from from

easing it says Diaz have you ever heard

of Ashton

I want him to roll a persuasion chest

straight to knows him pretty well any

because no I'm gonna go ahead and do

this at disadvantage okay yeah deception

deception versus the or insight and I

and I Holly oh yeah it's all I gotta do

is beat your inside here comes that's

right twenty-four I got an eight I'm

just like I guess so I believe

everything you say ideas seven okay

evylyn is actually offended by how

easily she knows he's lying to her and

she's like are you lying to me

the Strix let's really hurt it like she

doesn't even say anything if evil and

says that she's just like looks like

like it

she's just been like a kicked puppy

she's like why why would you lie about

that why would you let me of all people

no no no what do you mean this is your

chance said eASIC to Strix my chance to

what Isaac look how weak is um I'm so

mad at him death will step back forward

and approach back towards them a little

bit mm-hmm and I guess entered his own

truth again alright when he does that

even like nods appreciatively and she's

like do you know about this Ashton thing

he'll take out gutter and toss it

towards them and like just let let onto

the ground and then he just points at it

and we'll just say apparently that's his

is why didn't you tell us that Ashton

I thought Ashton was a place or an

accord state of mind are we talking

about I'm upset paltin when you come to

you see there's a sword thrown in the

moist dirt near your feet it looks like

death sword gutter I just kind of just

I'm like barely there I'm like just I

just kind of like reach down and grab it

and I'm just looking at it like who are

you y'all is anyone else here the sword

talk yes talking yes okay is not

okay right now don't give him the

talking item take it away we're having a

conversation now is very nice you talked

to the sword now yeah a gift we'll say

don't remember back it's to the lab are

strips you were there that dwarf came by

and he gave it to me I just said it

belonged to Ashton oh who is Ashton

Ashton is my dad your dad you have a dad

how come you didn't tell us that I like

that that's paulie's major revelation

you just thought D have climbed out of

the ground now that was one of the

sacred gift like I Suz he started

speaking he guy couldn't stop himself

the earth used to always say he was born

in the streets of Waterdeep and paul him

just kind of took that literally he was

your father

I look like it Isaac is this a weird

coincidence

he wasn't lore Tata he was his name is

Ashton Woodrow I have always been DF

Woodrow and regardless of anything he's

he's no father of mine

do you think that what Isaac is saying

makes any sense

ya know none of this makes any sense

you're us there were mercy Killers after

us something has to do with this I don't

know I've told you about sigil you know

what else have you been lying to us

about death hold on

actually I should have to think about

this I'm in the zone of truth what are

you gonna tell us you have a mom - you

didn't tell us about your dream at all

and you didn't tell us about the key

dude my districts about that I didn't

lie it was it was omitted like the whole

mission

I'm dazzle saying I'm not lying I don't

know what any of this is sounds fake you

won't believe that she turns to Paulson

what about you you lying about anything

mmm oh dude constantly evil right paltin

I would take off the it's complicated

box right now I'm not gonna be killing

anyone today all right all right well it

sounds like this is either a big

misunderstanding or ease like you have

more explaining to do because I don't I

think you're just causing strife on

purpose he says to Strix come back with

me to Belloc II will talk to lady walked

her and look at her books together Strix

does really like books but she hates him

so know where she goes we go so we can

all go back to the locky if you know a

way out of this place that's true I

don't want to go back there at all but

we could do that we're getting out of

here we have to go stop the Soul longer

we still have to stop we have to get out

of here

I'm dying we have the stuff this we're

all dying we have so many problems right

now that I can't even count them it's

still like is there still a little snow

where we're at a little bit yep so

paltin is just like on the ground making

a snow angel and then he like turns over

and goes look it's dia they all just

stare at him for a beat like like right

music is gonna try to get up off from

underneath evil and again go ahead and

make another check there evylyn yes

thank you okay you hold him down every

time he tries to get up she slams him

against the ground and I imagine that he

looks like really confused how yes

tiny yes I sort of roll around in his

skull and disbelief and I think that

like her boots somehow cuz even just by

like wait this is a weird physical thing

that she's able to hold down this giant

guy but I think she's using like her

flying boots almost - every time she

slams him down to like add force into it

so it slams into the girl and then she

looks at strix and says this Kazakhs

will destroy you before they let you be

friendly not if we destroy ourselves

first that's fair

how did the Skiz exede know where I am

how can they even find me I don't know

eASIC you're gonna have to go back to

lady's burger I found you through the

power of the vez tani lady lost her head

madam Ava perform a card reading so mad

he's mastani Talton do you know anything

about that can you stop that drinks from

being able to be found

do can I do i what you do possess

certain Bustani powers which are sort of

become atrophied with lack of use but

drinking yes dulls the senses will

contribute to that as well it's hard to

focus your evil eye when you see three

copies of a person in front of you but

you know that certain Vasanti

individuals typically women not always

but typically are blessed with the the

power of divination through the use of

cards you do not possess that power

personally but you do have other

abilities the ability to curse people

and such if you were to find a Bustani

who has the power of a seer they might

be able to guide you I will convey this

as best as I can okay all these snow

angels

there's something that's like a seer I

don't know it's maybe I asked eASIC is

your intention to hurt anyone in this

party why would you think that that's

not an answer

I know meso not sure for a while okay he

doesn't provide any other answer than

that death will our code and getting

daughter back okay you pick it up yep

I look at Strix I'm like well what do

you want to do all polymorph him and

we'll leave him got a preferred form

back to chicken what yeah he's a chicken

and I'll look at him and say I told you

before but this is my family I don't

care about the Skiz excitable or kapha I

don't care if he's a lord caca it

doesn't make a difference I'm never

leaving sounds like it makes a little

difference halted shut up giving a

speech can do the chicken which Yvonne's

no longer sitting on goes over and

starts pecking D at the boot oh my god

not as a chicken can i polymorph him

into uh I don't know something uglier

than a chicken he's a chicken

well they're doing that even crawls over

Napolitan who's like laying on the

ground and she kind of just like puts

her face over his and she's like how are

you feeling I have been better worse

yeah do you feel inclined to hurt anyone

in this party nah okay that's good did

you want to cast that polymorph spell on

him again

strings um yeah I'll turn him

there's something that isn't bad to kick

that's like not a pet but I could is bad

to kick I can't kick it although later

tiny spider okay

fighters are kind of gross but it I'll

make him like I don't know I mean I

wouldn't you also shouldn't kill big

spiders but if you can kick the spider

I'm not gonna kick it otherwise we'll

break the polymorpha I don't want to see

his dick and face again oh well I did

this for you okay so there's a little

spider crawling around the ground it's

fine

yeah this is fine you've won try to get

him up we need to get back and get

moving I have to get out here she holds

out a hand for father okay does he take

it if not she just throws him over her

shoulder like a fireman oh no I won't

thank you all right you pick him up you

hop back in the carriage and you leave

Isaac behind any spider for knowing

he'll river to his human form in an hour

right you trend along and on and on

we'll get out before then alright so you

guys know you find your dog are you guys

still sharing the rings of protection

yet imagine my ODF has less hit points

than Strix so I haven't have it until

she's about the same I was wearing it

most recently alright I'll just okay

like I'm good man you just please don't

die alright 15 days pass and each of you

loses 5 from your maximum hit points oh

my god

right now DF is also just like so I have

DF at 20 Strix at 29 yeah son right yeah

and palton after all of the deletions to

your maximum hit points where are you at

umm well unless I miss track something

yeah but the the ring of winter stop

that as well or dead yes so I believe I

have 36 okay well Chris yes my maximum

is 18 o 18 sorry

as this keeps happening evylyn has like

you know she has this morning tradition

like every morning her rituals like gets

up she prayed she does her like I hired

man work out up in the air and all that

stuff and then she goes off to pray and

I imagine that like day by day like the

amount of time she spends away from

everyone is getting like longer and

longer like suspiciously so and you can

tell that there's something that's like

really weighing on her and I think that

yeah just that that's okay you guys

observed the same thing evylyn becomes

increasingly detached over the period of

ten days trembling along in this coach

yeah

the next time she like goes off to do

her thing I want to follow her okay all

right just alone if I can okay you do

and look what do I see yes we'll be back

at the wagon still he's feeling gross

and sick what does he see evylyn

although i did not expect this but this

is the truth he sees her uh she prays

out loud when she's alone and so he sees

her sitting down and she's kind of doing

like like a call-and-response prayer

that you can tell there's parts where

like she's reciting a prayer that she's

supposed to recite that she's learned

for certain situations and she's kind of

adding her own words into it so you you

see her very like overcome like you know

shoulders hunched and she's saying holy

lord of the morning witnessed your

servant kneeling and like levander I'm

here I know I messed up real bad this

time and I'm in been really deep and I I

need your help getting out have mercy on

your servant willing Bowden worthy

earnest but faint of heart

I just I thought it was all harmless I

thought that just daydreaming couldn't

hurt anyone no you're right it's time to

be honest with myself and be honest with

you and I thought thought I was special

I'm so ashamed I know I thought that

despite all of it you might so

embarrassing

you might bless me with a life mate just

like you did my own pop in that he of

all people might be that life mate and I

know that's so stupid so hear the

confession of your servant that she has

been tempted by darkness and has turned

her face from the light I've been weak

and I've been selfish and I love Halton

more than a paladin should and it put

people in danger and people died and

that is my fault and there it said and

then that has turned my face from my

duty and it's endangered this family and

it's hindered your whole purpose and I

confess it and I give it over because

it's become more than I could handle on

my own so baptize your servant what's

more in the faithful to wash away the

darkness that clings I am your divine

appointed bond slave of the Morning Sun

light forged warrior daughter of the

Most High Amen paltin as this happens

you can see there is no Sun it's just

gray bleakness roiling clouds a cauldron

of black ether in the air and then it

just starts to rain on both of you I'm

gonna go say how'd you really mean all

that I'm just gonna like walk up and

just sit next sir just take a

wine in hand I'm just like you put a lot

of faith in that God hears you know that

the middle name is text I don't know

seems like the things you want are

things you should be working for

yourself rather than hoping some some

some Santa Claus looking mofo is gonna

be like here you go that's fair can I

can talk to you for a minute

I mean we're talking but like Ken knows

okay cool so well Chris how long has it

been since the Rings been gone it's been

about 10 days I'm sorry I 15 days it's

been about 15 days since the ring has

left and I've I know initially in the

moment I said Nia destroy that ring this

that's the life mission that's all

badness after gathering my thoughts I

have kind of assembled what I want to

say but it's just it's it's so even

though it's been a couple weeks it's

still so fresh and it's still so hard to

talk about and I don't I don't know if I

am emotionally ready to talk about what

happened yet all right fine I'll tell

you since you asked okay so a couple

weeks ago you know I like tried to kill

y'all right you remember that I think

yeah okay just making sure we're on the

same page it's like

the only way I could describe what was

going on was it's like it's like things

that are logical when you're in a dream

wait do you dream still no you don't

sleep do robots dream Christmas yes yes

he's thought your dreams yeah okay cool

but it's all those things where it's

like you know there's stuff happening in

the dream and it could be like oh I'm

gonna you know make a make a house out

of out of clouds because clouds are more

obstruction Elise ound and like stone or

wood or things like that it's all those

things where you wake up and you snap to

and you're just like that makes no sense

whatsoever but then you realize just a

couple minutes ago it made all the sense

in the world

and in the moment killing you guys made

all the sense in the world because of

what the ring was doing to me and I'm

not a fan of apologies but I think

that's what I'm trying to do but but

above all that there's something I

haven't I haven't told you that I'm sure

there were a lot of assumptions about

but I haven't actually said it but

that's why I wanted the ring in the

first place the ring a winner and I just

feel like you know I feel like everyone

deserves you know you DF Strix and

everyone in the subreddit deserves an

explanation

the truth is since day one I've never

really felt like a contributing fourth

of this party it's always felt like

three hard-working passionate

adventurers tagging this guy along just

they got him on a rope and he's just

dragging behind and you know like you

cuz you guys have like you guys have so

much stuff you're good at you know like

yo Strix is really good at magic you

know d/f is gonna look 18 forever so

he's got that like you know Shonen boy

protagonist thing going on so it's like

that's a pretty solid MC and you're

you're the strongest person Kurt you are

you're really strong then there's me the

the drunk

the silent player who just kind of goes

along with everything but man when when

I first saw that ring and I saw him

conjure that iceberg I was like that's

it

that's how I can that's how I can

contribute that's how I can become the

fourth piece you know I can I can be the

ice power guy and that'll be great

and it was great it was awesome I was I

was making all kinds of ice animals it

was tuned to me and I loved it and then

it was saying really it was saying nice

things to me and it was just like yeah

you're doing great I'm just yeah I'm

doing great and eventually that turned

into like you know it'll be like oh you

should you know like step away I'm like

yeah I should step away you haven't

steered me wrong

and then eventually came to it's like

you should you kill your friends I'm

like yeah I guess that makes sense

and looking back at it now it just kills

me to know that that's what I thought

was the right thing and

I don't know where I'm going with this

but it's it just I feel like you should

you should know why that whole that

whole arc went down so I'm sorry and I

 up and hopefully I can work to

make it up to everybody

she takes both of his hands no thing I

know that wasn't you and I know why it

happened and it wasn't your fault that's

my job should be the one that sees those

things and know that they can happen

paltin is this is happening you know

that evylyn can't cry but the rain

cascading down her face makes it look

like she is Thank You Christmas and she

says that's the thing that's that's what

you overheard I can't I can't do my job

the way that I should because because I

should do my job better and I'm sorry

and it's my fault I it's like it's not

your fault it's not anyone's fault

entirely

I mean you know anyway you know if

anything it was Miranda's fault somehow

right is she like Santa Claus yeah yeah

she's like Santa Claus palton it it sort

of dawns on you in this moment that even

though you've been traveling for fifteen

days you've witnessed Strix is perpetual

dread you've witnessed DF and evylyn

having second thoughts about what

they're really experiencing

doubts that what they're experiencing is

in fact true you don't feel like

personally you've had any symptoms like

that here you feel pretty much like you

did before the ring took hold of you I

know that I know that this place is is

uh is messing with you guys

and we really do just we need to get out

of here and we need to not talk about

this again because that it's like huh oh

that hurt oh man

feelings suck dude Wow that was say man

I just I just had an evil ring trying to

make me kill my friends and I'm not

saying that was you know better but I

mean it wasn't it wasn't too far off

that was rough you know you don't enjoy

having feelings

oh well earlier I said

Easy's great feelings makes things not

easy you're right right yeah I should

remember that death and Strix

um palton evil in a while and now rain

we stay in silence rain is following in

the coach so you're kind of hunkered

down inside or quiet outside if the end

is being quiet Strix is just like taking

snake snacks out of a robe and just

throwing them at him she's done this

before yeah like like you like it like

an hour passes she's like and that's

when he's finally just like what you

look upset I'm dying

yes you are you also lied

she takes one of the snacks back I'm

sorry you're right do you know anything

else about the Lord hatha no not I don't

know anything about the lore katha I

only ever heard that word from from

music I don't know what that means is

there anything else you haven't told me

she takes another snack back puts it

back in a row you do recall the earth

that you did have that vision in water

deep we have a soul on ice all thank you

what there yep and you saw strings yeah

yeah okay

it goes to reach for another snack yes

tricks there's there's lots I don't tell

you why

because I know magic I can handle it I

know but I I still feel fear but you

shouldn't be afraid as I'm here I know

magic yes I know and like throws a snack

you can have one back now there's I go

through a lot I be through a lot and we

talked about this before but I just need

I know I have to be strong I know I need

to just help make sure everyone else

here just gets home safe that's all I

want it's just get everyone else home

safe then after that maybe I'll worry

about myself yeah but I worry about you

so you have to worry about yourself too

she throws another snack her staff right

now is that oh wow

why don't you catch the other ones

there's like a bunch of snacks just look

around him as her staff is the owl bear

right now so she's just like holding on

yeah yeah and she's just like you

shouldn't have you shouldn't have to do

that

I'll be here always use magic and keep

you safe - I know sharks I know you'll

always be around it that's I want that

more than anything well good

too bad the mercy killers don't alright

there's a sound that sort of comes from

the ogre zombie it's like a

yeah this is like this Jacqueline and

this this horrible horrible putrid

stench washes over the two of you yeah

it's like she just drops her snack like

yeah yes just like actually it actually

causes tricks his hat to wilt Indians be

like oh and I'm getting fresh air you

step out and Wiggin okay oh god yeah you

pot you'll get out of the wagon just to

get out of the stench cuz of course its

ass is parked rate word or I can get in

where the stench could get into the

coach really really easily

palton and evylyn what do you do

evylyn had just agreed like alton had

just said you know feelings make

everything difficult he was like you're

absolutely right I'm sorry I'm gonna do

better all one's gonna just bring her in

for a hug

okay just she's like doesn't understand

what the hug means she's just kind of

like and then he like during the he just

kind of looks up and he just goes chat

you can't rush this stuff nothing no one

are you praying

we're drunk you can see the fourth wall

are you praying to lift the handle sure

that's good that's real good I

I'll do my job not let feelings get in

the way and you keep on praying till the

founder and everything will be much

better

you got it we should we should head back

oh you guys are sort of you know arms

over each other's shoulders heading back

to Diaz and Strix do you want to

separate at some point

to make it seem like you know you

haven't had a heart-to-heart even

doesn't think that way okay hmm okay

yeah so they come back

Diaz and Strix and they're they're sort

of arm and arm chums and the rain is

coming down yeah everybody's drenched

did deal zombie parted she's waving her

hands D if I'll see them together

display a speck all right you're all

back together you guys ready to go are

we still going the right way

periodically Strix can waive her dead

claw in front of the meathook and it

seems to be leading you in the same

direction as before yeah and this is

like I mean I know that we have to go

someplace with a bunch of dead so if

he's going to where there's dead that's

where we'll find a portal okay

I believe you all right are you gonna

hop back in now yeah yeah okay pickin as

well

all right after brushing like crumbs

merry Strix will pick up all the crumbs

off the ground and be like then we don't

have a lot of food and then we'll take

turns I guess guiding me hug okay

several more days pass and you go

through your usual routines Strix you

have 24 maximum hit points DF you have

13 ah and palton you have 31 I won't

wear the ring it's true you won't wear

the ring anymore if you'll just give it

to dia she she looks she cannot and you

feel the air has changed quite a bit and

as you look ahead at where meathook is

going you can see what looks like or

actually what you hear is the sound of

the ocean

they've water here mmm

and it's quite misty

and foggy and all the fog is sort of

rolling over you to the point where

whoever is guiding the coach at this

particular time which I'll say is Strix

arbitrarily Strix you can just see sort

of billows of fog ahead with just the

hint maybe you can see maybe like 30

feet ahead of you the hint of scrub and

brush on things but the sound of the sea

gets louder and louder and you come to

or you begin to see popping up here and

there

Cairns basically piles of rocks in such

a way to suggest that they might be

crypts or memorials to the dead and you

see them become a more regular and I

would like you to make a perception

check strikes as meathook the 14

threatens to walk you off a cliff 14

okay Lucy meathook heading toward a

cliff what do you say to try to stop him

I would like everybody to make dexterity

saving forth are we within evil ends ora

yo yeah yes and that's a saving throw so

you get plus five so guys I'm going over

the cliff I'm dead famine okay that's

pretty boss how did you do evylyn with I

just realized my aura of protection

gives me the benefit as well

so with that I get a 10

okay palton uh twelve okay dear

thirty-four

okay calm down okay so meathook goes

over the coach goes over with him but as

via Strix is shouting Strix you're you

can get off you can either jump off or

you can hop on your broom and zip off

your choice I'll get on my broom okay so

there's a big cloud of smoke that

engulfs the coach as it goes over DF you

throw open one of the side doors and can

tumble out but you know to that

evylyn and paltin who are inside with

you and Simon - don't seem to be nearly

as fast as you so as you throw up in the

door and leap out do you want to do

anything and you you leap out like seven

or eight feet before the coach goes over

because you're really really on the ball

oh no and at this point everything is

happening so fast you're not sure

they're gonna get out or not they might

get out you have no idea just pop Alton

heavies mandolin he does great I grabbed

Simon and get him out okay you can pull

Simon out with you

paltin you see ya fly out a door with

Simon in his hand oh good alright

alright

and paltin you rolled a 12 right mm okay

so as the coach goes over you know you

clamour out as much as you can and throw

yourself outside the coach as the coach

disappears below you and I would like

you just to make a strength saving throw

to hold on to the cliff edge oh that's

probably gonna be really fun still here

by o on the coach so that's an aura

right uh yeah she huge you so you get

the bonus from

you get +5 13 okay you managed to hold

on to the cliff and see grab money just

like Oh disappear below you mwah and

yeah well you know that the only one

left in the coach when it fell was

evylyn oh no all right when you think

coach disappears just mean plummeting

not just yeah it just plummets down down

the cliff okay evylyn doesn't come out

strict so I'll follow in her broom like

no there's a lot of fog so you can't

really see very well you just kind of

see it go over the cliff and disappear

into the fog Wow

all right and then you hear a splat and

a crash as the coach shatters down on

the jagged rocks below right right you

tried to get out but because your

dexterity check wasn't great and the

coach doors are sort of flapping closed

every every effort you probably like try

to crawl out through the back window and

then you sort of get caught and suddenly

you you crash upon the rocks below so I

have to roll some damage for evylyn who

of all the people to get slammed by the

rocks is probably the best that she has

more hit points than anybody evylyn you

take a lot of dice 39 points of damage

as you crash down upon the rocks

you're just here floating up all right

Dee ethylamine you like screw you over

to the cliff face you see you see some

fingers for grabbing onto the cliff face

yeah help me she like reach for paulten

dyke help pull them up all right paulten

you see DF attempting to pull you up do

you accept his offer of aid no

absolutely yes I do it's not great

because at this point I'm so weak from

the death curse that's nice much of it

takes everything he's got to pull you up

over the edge but he does manage to do

it

Fergus is like mr. hooky the third

whatever your name was

and Strix as you sail around and try to

get a bead on evil and make another

perception check through the fog you can

see a couple things all up and down the

coast are the colossal wrecks

of dozens if not hundreds of ships all

sort of leaning precariously their

shattered masts and hulls creating this

jagged ass of dark wood before you and

they're all sort of wrecked on tooth

like shards of rock that thrust up from

the sea you can also see that the the K

the the walls of the cliff are white

white stone and the the beach seems to

be very dark almost like black rock and

pebbles but you can also make out what

appear to be scattered it almost at

first it looks like snow or something on

the beach but as you swoop down it's

actually bones I was like oh they're

bones piles on piles of bones hundreds

of thousands of bones

o Millions yep rest in peace me hook you

did your job well when you claw when you

climb out of the wreckage and what used

to be the coach you can see that

meathook is basically in four pieces

with his trunk his body basically

impaled through a rock bless him

Lysander in the lab in the morning as he

walks to the dawn a man just drying his

I don't think she can throw it all

immediately start looking for portals or

anything that looks like it could be a

shadow crossing even has like like a

like a bone like sticking out of her

actually

probably happened is when meathook hit

the ground hit the rocks first touches

his body were thrust up through the

coach and parts of his bones went

through your body so one I need hooks

bones like one of his finger bones of

sticking up oh and I would imagine she

has like and you felt you felt went

across like her cheek yeah she's got

like smashed in cheek yeah and probably

some gore yeah based on yours and Strix

is estimate you fell about a hundred

feet you're like really died we all

would have died except for evylyn yeah

all right and Strix is shouting that

she's looking for shadow portals or

shadow crossings as she flies through

the air unseen through the fog everyone

kind of shakes herself on it shakes

yourself off and flies up with her boots

unaware of her appearance and just

appears two strikes like I'm fine this

feels like you do notice that evil ins

got like a big bone shard stuck in her

she is dead I don't think I'm dead am i

dead wait I'm still under that curse

right I yes you are currently still

suffering from the despair oh I actually

don't think I'm dead though that's good

Strix I'm sure I'm not dead Strix I want

to have you make an intelligence check

I'm alright let's call it Arcana

actually hello good

that's sixteen it has occurred to you

after the last several days as the dread

slowly consumes you that there must be

some magical way to get rid of this

despair Oh hmm maybe remove curse maybe

didn't we try that already no no I'll

try it on evil and be like enough curse

maybe yeah when you cast the remove

curse on evil and evil and you feel the

weight of the despair lift

from you oh that feels good oh well I'm

really really dumb and then she'll go

and cast Emily okay he'll zoom down and

be like hey guess what it's like slap

said you're dumb you just think like

this this place has given you a sudden

hope that you can find a way home that

that little glimmer of hope seemed to

have overcome in the moment that has

been just crushing you for the last

several weeks and and sort of opened

your eyes to the possibility that the

despair could actually be lifted ironic

that it was me that had a glimmer of

hope yes after she cast said on deaath

and the curse has lifted the first thing

he does is look around just goes oh god

it is all real no like oh my god we left

Miranda somewhere Oh God

it's it's worse knowing it's all real Oh

No and strict I'll cast it finally on

herself okay and lifting the dirt

lifting the burden she still feels

normal dread yeah which doesn't feel the

shadow fell dress right okay still like

oh wait I was just a normal scream now

it's possible based on your estimation

that this despair could overcome you

again if you spend a whole lot longer in

here but you've given the party a

reprieve all right at the cost of you

know three spells lots also at this

point strict had found the blanket off

of meathook and brings it back to death

and is like you're not looking great put

this blanket on I'd imagine him I'd

imagine so I've imagined that with how

probably well added awesome and they

sort of lodged itself on top of a

shattered mast there you go well how

much like the death curse has affected

DF and Strix puts like a blanket over

them I'd imagine it's pretty much almost

a closed mirror of when deaath accepted

the dark curse and Strix put the blanket

or hood over him it's very similar to

that yes and the blanket feels like it

weighs 90 pounds

it's saturated with water and this is

heavy and you know you're weak and frail

okay

and then Strix you're starting to look

now Strix you're not sure how you're

gonna find a shadow portal you're

obviously close to one this is a place

of immense death countless people who

died here but it could literally be

anywhere could be in that ship that ship

that ship it could be who knows all

right well my death Finder is now

impaled is there a way that we can help

um yeah I think so I mean those two they

may be easier getting down there than I

do can I use divine sense to see like

yes you are picking up some great evil

nearby oh good just in case anyone's

wondering there's a great evil nearby oh

okay you're you sort of like spread your

hands around and look and sort of wave

them I just sort of hold them out to

sort of like a like you're a divining

rod or something trying to get a bearing

on them and you get the sense that they

are below you so farther down in the and

maybe in the stone of the cliffs like

maybe a cave or something I don't know

it's not coming from the wrecks it seems

to be coming from closer to you and

underneath you maybe that's where the

portal is I don't know if a great portal

is inherently evil but there is some

evil and I think it's under there which

means it's probably a hole and I would

assume that portals go real well in

holes in caves and things

the ships are fine though don't worry

about those you are actually picking up

undead in the ships except for the

undead I'm not you wouldn't call them

like powerful life forces like a vampire

or a lich but there's definitely the

presence of undead creatures moving

around on the ships okay so maybe just

ignore the ships let's not go on the

ships if you feel something for my cave

we should try that first Oh

I'll go check it out wait no we're all

gonna go together everyone's going

together we're not separating do you fly

but you've Evelynn years old you took

off and then you're like 30 feet away

you come back or do you just keep on

going uh she's 30 feet away but then

strictures we're all going together so

she kind of turns and like taps her foot

in the air like if she needs everyone to

fly she can polymorph dieppe into that

something the fly cool I'd like

everybody cool bird though I'd like

everybody to make perception checks are

you Polly marking BF at this point in

time strings yeah I'll turn him I'll

turn him into an eagle that's cool bird

all right

are you voluntarily failing you're

saving through it depends they might do

my perception check before after the

Polly Marsh and you go that's pretty

good perception let's say after I have

pretty good perception after all right

I'll be coming even eagle yeah as an

eagle you'll be very perceptive yeah

y'all okay um maybe not as perceptive as

death I don't know we're gonna look it

up mine's actually pretty good okay

Hey eagle an eagle huh but here's here's

the thing I'll let you use your

perception but you get advantage on your

roll because you're an eagle oh well

that's very better 29 great anybody else

were all well I for 17 ok 17 and 29 is

gonna do it halten and DF and I should

really check for Simon

okay palton and waffles and waffles

paltin and eeeh you see swooping down

upon you from high above a gigantic rock

sized bird and it's black and you

realize it is a gargantuan Raven

and it swoops down and lands on top of

the cliff behind you so that you are

between it and the water I come back now

do you want to be an eagle anymore and

then it turns into thousands of Ravens

that just flurry and swarm around you

Strix holds her arms out like in burrow

via and then it coalesces into a figure

[Laughter]

yeah it's about it's like a six foot

tall vaguely human shaped mound of twigs

like a a walking nest that's what I was

one has seen it before he's the only one

of you who has but now you all see it

how scary would you say I would no

longer like to be a bird what languages

do you all speak soonest E if will give

you a kiss it's tricks like the eyes of

the eagle like I shall turn back into a

person I speak common elvish and

celestial I speak infernal and abyssal

thieves can't common Elish all right I

know what you speak as this thing as

this thing makes noises that are

completely unearthly underneath that you

can hear or evylyn you can hear that

it's speaking celestial no no no he

comes in handy yeah this is fine it says

in celestial

okay it has come for the chalice or in

the hand do we have a chalice I say in

celestial which hand my friend

did she hot chicken chicken chicken

chicken

something at this point in time paltin

severed hand sort of crawls up onto his

shoulder and looks halted has a hand

pulping first of all hi hope you've been

well you hear it's a and well she says

is what what she says that you translate

evylyn is uh she says your fate has been

stolen from you you don't need those

treasures anymore I asked for what

purpose did he meet the treasure oh she

says there's a reward if you give him

back a real nice prize give them back

give them back give the bag Strix is

like it's a power give them back in the

bag she's like on the ground covering

like now now let's think about this I

just grabbed them okay when you do that

you see flying out of her arm or Ravens

and they go down they swoop down and

they grab they snatch up the hand they

snatch up the chalice and they start to

fly off with them by hand drew

and she goes from being 40 feet away to

being 5 feet away from his welcome

clutches right there hate when you do

that and you just look into this black

void of this nestea face where there's

nothing there except darkness and that

evil and you translate the sounds that

she makes and she says she pops up from

behind her that she wants to know if

there's something she can give you like

awkward c3po style like injecting

herself into the conversation a portal a

portal portal starts is just yelling on

the ground like shut the hold on uh I

would suggest maybe something that has

to do with the death curse fixing she

says she knows if she knows then I'd

trust her she said she knows what you

want do you believe she knows what you

want what do you want I'm scared I don't

know what will she be more specific uh

pardon me but could you be a little bit

more specific she just explodes into

Ravens all around you just sort of flies

past you palton all these beating wings

up against your face you kinda have to

cover your eyes for an instant and then

she just turns into this vortex or

tornado of these birds flies up into the

air they all coalesce into a giant bird

and fly off did she leave any gifts is

there anything in your pockets I think I

liked it better when I didn't know what

was real you sort of look around

everybody make perception checks to see

what she has done I'm just gonna say

that Strix is crying on the ground in a

medium okay that's fine perfectly fine

she's got her hat pulled so far down

over her head she angles the stitches

rip out a part of it yeah she's like

it's a power it's a power I'm just

afraid

help help help I got a very

uncharacteristic nineteen okay mmm

fourteen good twenty-nine the throne of

you who have I I see who are paying

attention turn around and see at first

nothing seems out of the ordinary but as

you look over towards Simon something

has changed about him his mouth I mean

he seems to have a more instead of just

like a hinged dropping chin there is an

actual mouth there and he sort of looks

at all of you and that's where I'll stop
