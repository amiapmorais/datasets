hi everybody and welcome to another

exciting episode of dice camera action

we got not one but two guest stars today

Brooks is returning playing sister and

awry and at me vivica is well we all

know what she's going to be playing but

when is she going to show up in what

form TBD when last we left the waffle

crew they attended an auction attended

by such luminaries as Victoria and

Amalia Castle enter several members of

the santarem and of course the

swashbuckling growlithe REO Jarl axle

beam ray many of them in disguise will

not many of them Charl axle in disguise

the others not so much

when the waffle crew showed up they were

in disguise one of the few to attend the

auction that bothered to hide their true

identities and the auction got underway

the Stoneham galore was presented and

before the auction could conclude

however Strix played with the lights

mm-hmm freaked a bunch of people out

caused Jarl axel to cast the darkness

spell upon the room which is there no

longer and then people started stabbing

each other and throwing each other

around in the chaos the auctioneer

pawned the stone of gholar off to sister

narai who made it out the door made it

out the door only to be tackled by DF

who ended up with the stone in the end

after they were wrestling around with it

and before DF could do anything with the

stone Jarl axel came upon him

threatening to impale him unless he gave

him the artifact and that's where we

left off with Jarl axel next to DF

insisting that he surrender the stone

and DF telling him no and I'm trying

I've been trying to remember exactly

what evylyn saw this is not that's right

she was busy fighting a demon yeah as we

get to each of your character

I'll describe sort of what you can see

within your field of vision but

basically this whole scene is being

played out in two rooms joined by a set

of double doors that is open at the

moment so depending on your point of

view you may be in one room but can sort

of see what's happening in the other one

of the rooms is the auction room Strix

and evylyn are in that room the other

room is the the gathering hall the feast

halls and deaath and paltin and cistern

Arai are in that room but the first to

go is Jarl Axl and if you recall Jarl

Axl came to the party with two lovely

women one of whom is in the auction room

and is currently unconscious after

getting rained upon by fireballs and

flame strikes the other one is out in

the gathering room having fled the

chamber with a number of other

individuals and she's got this feather

boa around her neck palton she runs over

to you because you seem sort of calm

cool and collected you're sitting on one

of the tables with a wine glass in your

hand while people who are screaming are

running past you to get out but she runs

over to you and grasps on to you and

shakes you and says do something

meanwhile Jarl Axl

stands over UDF and casts a glance

through the double doors at evylyn sees

evelyn make eye contact with him and

with UDF because of course evil in his

bat already and she's looking to see

where the trouble is locking on to all

the friends that she can see the only

one she can't see right now is paltin

but evil and when you lock eyes on the

door locks on you see Jarl axel looming

threatening above D F he steps back and

sheaths his sword

heck yeah he does holy down boy

that's all that happens on his turn this

is making me stress sweat so yeah and

actually no he'll he'll actually help

you to your feet

DF if you so wish okay okay as he helps

you up he'll kind of brush you off a

vlinn smiles warmly at the person that

she sees helping her friend who seems to

be totally on her team right and that's

when Amalia castle enter comes out of a

restroom this is in the same room that

DF cisterna Rui paltin and Jarl Axl are

in along with a number of people fleeing

the auction you can see that she has

blood on her face specifically it looks

like she's painted some sort of

blasphemous symbol on her forehead in

blood she comes out uttering phrases in

infernal and casts a spell oh no I'm in

the other room yeah I'm in the other

room okay

what are we exactly

and dia you are the target of the spell

I need you to make a wisdom saving throw

you feel like you're being beguiled is

this happening in the room I'm in it

sure is

and Ike it's safe to assume that this

nonsense is some kind of spell yes you

recognize it it's a suggestion spell oh

cool I'm really no counter space okay

now I believe she has ruined her makeup

and for nothing it well alright

yes so this is a third level spell so

you counter spell it automatically and

it goes fizzle fizzle pop and she

screams in rage Thank You paltin because

I did a resident with him saving throat

just to see and yeah it was a natural

one oh nice so you know yeah she comes

out speaking and telling he's like no

and then she starts screaming he's just

like shut up

[Laughter]

palton your turn so who was it that came

out with all this crazy gibberish

nonsense that tried to that would be a

lady jack-o'-lantern yeah yeah one of

the the the mother of the of the family

who recall you were at her house and she

showed you her son who was turned into a

devil and her other two gorgeous

children who she fears will suffer the

same fate the one where Simon tried to

join a cult in their basement yeah yeah

yeah that was her basement I gathered

that so then so the this is the the lady

we said we'd save the Sun from becoming

a devil then she comes out doing this

devil talk to to do to to insource hole

your friend DF yes huh with blood on her

face all right cool that's know by far

the most hostile person in the room

right now by your estimation okay cool

so I'm gonna go ahead and I I'm not in

like kill mode because I'm just kind of

assessing what's going on there's a lot

of like Alliance questions here so I'm

just gonna I'm just gonna banish her oh

okay as I see stuff I'm just like no

leave

all right and what is the DC of that

with with my hand pointed out that would

be a charisma 20 that's right you've got

your creepy crawly undead hand that

gives you extra extra jolt of I love

this just no no yeah I love that a lot

of polkas ability is just that's a later

problem all right

you just about to stiff arm a

necromancer so I wouldn't sell him short

you know there is a rift in the floor

she falls through and disappears cool

literally she comes out you just like no

stop no don't do that

just like leave all together waiting

I feel like palton does that too like

unruly fans - all right as you do the

woman clinging on to you with the

feather boa sort of jostles you a little

bit as she screams in surprise when

Amalia falls through the floor I need

you to make a dexterity saving throat

palton excuse me okay so that's a 9 you

spill your drink she think you were

doing

are you staying where you are sure okay

sister narai your name you're lying on

the floor near deaths feet after he

tackled you okay so um my it would be

berlin this actually would be half my

move isn't it to get up yes the bonus

okay so um so as I stand up I'm going to

real quick use an axiom to to figure out

where the rest of my screw is that

because it'd be really cool if they

didn't send four people in and then I

just did I mean I know that whatever it

is

so you're standing in the doorway more

or less you can see pretty clearly into

both rooms

Astrid horn the dwarf is still in the

auction room near evylyn and Strix dable

star song her son elf bard companion

looks like he was wounded by the flame

strike spell and is being guarded by

j√§ger stone fist in that same room so

all of your associates are in the

auction room leaving you basically in

the Gathering Hall alone with DF Jarl

axel great okay all right now when I say

that you're away from them really I'm

talking about 20 feet away from them

sure I mean yeah um okay so alright so

and is that that's like a that's a

that's a full action I imagine arias

that's just like I glanced into the room

and see what's going on you're just that

cost you nothing to glance in the room

and take stock before super sudra okay

so I believe let me take a look here

because I think of that I have I do

alright so seeing as everybody is

blasting through these room this room

right now I am going to use two key and

use pass without trace to blend into the

crowd and move towards the door the door

being the the out that the far though

I'm in this auction house got a door or

door that everybody's fleeing make a

stealth check alrighty I will do that

and my stealth is good

hey all right so that's going to be a

seventeen all things considered plus the

pass without trace gives you plus 10 I

believe oh okay 27 stealth alright then

I would like DF and paltin to make

perception checks

alright sevens actually pretty good I

may not be able to see this I have to

roll at least it's pretty good higher

yeah I got five yeah

dirty 20 so expertise it'll 21 alright

so yeah and I'll roll for Daryl axel

since you probably only wanted us to

stance even a chance of seeing you like

so perception Wow he's good but not good

enough

oh yeah yep so you see by the ocean yeah

you get over to the other door near the

exit

some people blissfully running past you

on aware of your presence you can see

that as you look into the third room the

entry room with a circle on the floor

there is a door against the far curved

wall that people have arrived at and

have thrown open unfortunately you see

as they crowd around it somebody fall

through the door and literally fall out

like the door it must be up in the air

all you can see is sort of night sky did

I come in through the air Chris okay so

okay I need to take a second here so did

you mention that there was a big circle

on the floor I did yes

and that that is how you arrived by

teleportation circle oh right so

teleportation circle okay cuz I was

thinking that other things can get less

these guests can't teleport away on

their own so they ran to the outside

door and one of them just got pushed out

accidentally is there a Wilhelm scream

I'm really yeah yes by God yes there's

no I mean is it just the one dude who

fell or is it just this cab locator you

can't you can't tell if has heard it and

a bunch of other people are in the

doorway blocking your view

great super so this is more important

that was a very good Wilhelm scream by

the way that's like I have an app for

that actually so I I'm going to I'm

going to turn around and realize that

this is this is way way more dangerous

than I initially anticipated so what I'm

going to do is change where the

attention in the room is and find the

most important

and most panicked person I can it I can

see or like anybody who's like not

trying to immediately get out and still

paying attention stone thing I'm going

to say I think someone stole the stone

and I think they're right over there

says narai gesturing toward the jar you

know the guy who looks like Prince and

the two adventury looking types okay you

should say something

yeah if you're looking for the most sort

of panicked but attentive person in the

room that would be the woman next to

paltin who knocked his drink astray if

you want to go for somebody else that's

fine um yeah I'm not gonna immediately

go for the protagonists people in their

code so I'll just see if I can if I can

just say yeah yeah there's somebody some

random some Rando basically shouts @df

pointing that he's got the stone of goal

or great I'll call that my turn great

evylyn you are in the auction room

staring down a barber devil that has

taken a considerable amount of damage at

this point the same Barbra devil that

was cowed by Strix --is whatever

that was shuddering shuddering voice and

I just saw my dear friend Jarl axel

making sure that my friends in the other

room are okay yes so I feel very

reassured that my attention is best

spent here and that my friends are in

and the devil is by far and away the

greatest threat to you immediately but

you are not comforted by the fact that

you are also in the room with two

members sorry three members of the

Sontaran Lord Castle enter his tiefling

manservant okay

and I'm in there you said I'm in the

room with all of those and I can see

them all yes

how are they arranged scattershot

throughout the room

the devil is closest to you the tiefling

manservant is second closest to you but

kind of be

you over your shoulder he's standing

next to Lord Victoria Castle enter and

then the members of the Santarem are up

in the seats

so if per se even remembered that she

had a new spell that makes a bright

shiny line of pain could she cast that

bright shining line of pain in any way

that would hit multiple of them if you

ignored the devil and turned around and

fired it at the tiefling

Lord Castle enter and dabble the Sun

health is descent and his bodyguard

you'd hit all four of them okay but

Chris since I have movement how about if

she did a cool little like wing boot

flip over to behind the devil and then

shot in that line then she could add the

devil to make it five well since that

was a hypothetical let's actually do

that okay you will provoke from the

devil an attack of opportunity bring it

okay

ugly he swipes at you with a claw but he

rolls an eight so that that's a no-go go

ahead like daintily whooshes out of the

way and goes he all right and you fire

off your Sunbeam no that comes from

light Falls so I imagine that even holds

it like a I don't know like a rocket

launcher yeah all right

as the Sunbeam blazes from the tip of

light fall stretching out in a 60-foot

line that's five feet wide it engulfs

these five people who have to make a

constitution saving throws let's start

with devil so much that's right

devil fails tiefling man's servant

succeeds castle enter fails dabble

succeeds and his bodyguard fails so

bring it everybody who is not oh by the

way our Strix that light probably just

narrowly misses you yeah I like backup

like me it's okay I know what I'm doing

but it's so bright you kind of throw

your arms up over your face as it oh

yeah it's like I hissed like what we do

in the shadows like yes

that's an important no does evil ins

beams like that can be like hit party

members oh yeah all right cool I'm sure

is fine

33 radiant dancer he knows what she's

doing

oh man okay so 33 radiant damage the

devil is just absolutely scorched but

still alive clinging to life and

screaming the teeth laying man's servant

who takes half of that is still pretty

injured by it half of that 16 points

Victoria Castle enter not happy about

taking it all you see some of his flesh

burn off and actually some of his ashes

fly across the room and districts his

eyes and then the the Sun elf Bard is

complete is just for being protected by

his half work bodyguard he only takes

half of that but he was already pretty

hurt now he's more so his half-orc

bodyguard takes it all and she is not a

happy camper she looks at you evil and

like you are on her death list it takes

a moment goes the line of Lysander

compels you oh dude alright with this

new weapon it's borderline unattractive

how much she's feeling her stuff on

swept the tiefling manservant tugs on

Victoria Castle enter urging him is Lord

to get the hell out of the room and back

to the back toward the teleportation

circle Lord Castle enter having just

been baked by this beam of sunlight full

boy

now

they were all fighting her right like I

didn't just melt someone who was

potentially an ally right I I kind of

didn't think about that until they were

all well you're pretty sure that the

devil is Victoria's doing gotcha all

right toriel yeah based from Batman

exactly and dabble the Sun elf Zent

oh boy he can his beautiful face you

wrecked his beautiful face the only

beauty comes from a lot of levander well

apparently not all right he is going to

cast a spell on you

evylyn this spell is going to be a

saving throw and it's going to be a wait

there is no saving throw oh no but are

you sure I am so he targets you and you

are forced to begin a comic dance in

place

shuffling tapping your feet and capering

for the duration of the spell baby just

really excited about her she's shocked

and then she looks down at her feet

she's like now as an action which will

happen on your next turn you can if you

wish try to stop dancing with the wisdom

saving throw but until then you are

dancing like a maniac and other

creatures have Oh while you're dancing

you have disadvantage on dexterity

saving throws and attack rolls so you

can still attack while dancing that's

good to know

cool and other creatures have other

creatures have advantage to hit you

which is important because right now

dabbles bodyguard the hierarchy agra is

going to charge you and attack this i

have protection or resistance from

damage from spells but that doesn't

affect this right because this is just a

condition yeah it's not even it's not

technically even a condition it's just a

spell with no damage associated with its

okay Yaga comes over it takes two swings

at you sort of pushes not just the burnt

devil aside comes in and tries to whack

on you missing with one swing but the

other one she rules at 21 well how does

that affect your AC that will hit okay

since she's using both hands with this

battle axe she does a d-10 and it's

gonna do 12 points of damage to you oh

jeez that's slashing damage all right

that's their turn okay

one of the disguised guests comes over

Sorry Sorry

isn't there a blinding effect of Sunbeam

people that's a good question

I'm glad you mentioned that yeah people

are mentioning that because that will

change things they old save their

blinded till my next turn yes so

actually yagura' has disadvantage on

both of her attack roles so let me roll

again you may end up taking no damage on

this ah yes

dabble pays his save so he's not blinded

but I think that it is Riverdance thank

you that's great so no man she's gonna

Han Solo yeah you take you took no

damage from her blinding swings haha

alright let me see what's this fellow

gonna do woo by one of the guests who

was disguised grabs the woman who was

grabbing palton and pulls out a short

sword to hold her hostage and calls out

to Jarl axel to stand down or she gets

it and paltin and DF i will let you make

perception checks to see if you

recognize the individuals voice under

this costume

carry one not so much

22 you recognize the voice paltin as

that belonging to matram Marek AKA three

strings the guy who's Luke you stole and

who told you recently that he is a

Harper agent I don't want to be here

anymore miss 'tried the dwarf she was

blinded so she is going to fumble

blindly toward actually no she is going

to cast a spell and cure wounds on her

dabble and yeah grrah also real

quick-like as as soon as paulten

recognize the voice he's just like okay

i do what's up and

you can see his attention paltin is

completely on Jarl axle all right you're

doing so that well and okay the so all

the cents in the auction chamber get a

little bit oh no she can't do that she

can only heal herself because she's

blind

never mind she heals herself and

basically gives the finger to her

friends then Easter egg will blindly

make her way toward the exit to the

gathering hall and does so successfully

and she calls out for sister nor I I I

mean I see her is it like where are you

or like yeah sure you see her blindly

coming out into the gathering hall room

calling out your name and immediate like

immediately basically running into the

whole jar axle deaaath yeah situation

super okay well when it's my turn I'll

give away my position you can do that as

a free you can do that all right

talking is great then seeing her and

seeing and hearing my name called I will

do I will reach up and say Estrin

alright but this kind of betray your

location yeah I need backup at this

point yeah wait Victoire owes turn he to

is blind

let's see but he is going to heal

himself his wounds disappear

he is fine he'll stay where he is is

tiefling manservant Oh actually no on

since this t flee manservant goes next

after Victoria heals himself completely

with his healing magic he lets his Tiki

manservant lead him out of the room

so now evylyn in the room with you is

the devil two members of the Centaur

amande Strix everybody else is now out

in the

gathering area and let's CDF you've

still got the stone right yes you do as

far as I can tell Victoire Oh stealing

manservant stabs you okay or stab tries

to stab you but he only rolls a 15 oh

yeah l dogs vet okay

Strix you're in the back of the auction

room ashes from the radiant blast

covering your face and clothes you see

evylyn with the devil in front of her

the devil looks extremely hurt you also

see Da'Ville star song of the Santarem

and his blind but still threatening half

work bodyguard okay but do I know the

author Yelp is the one closest to you

you know I know yeah well do I know what

that was that like whatever she did I

mean that wasn't infernal you're talking

about evil the last episode no and she

like made that devil it was it was deep

speech it wasn't infernal oh I see you

don't you don't know what it was but it

didn't sound like infernal right so that

was concerning yeah number one so she's

concerned about that but she's right now

she's back to her normal self okay good

oh wow it's just another day I guess I'm

gonna focus on that devil and the other

ones by calling my dad's alright

spectral chickens appear and they can

you can put them out to a range of what

ah bacon I think it's hold on Missy get

Clark fifteen feet exactly uh and I'm

gonna cast it it that's around its

around yourself so you it's it's fifteen

feet around Strix yeah so you if you

want to put it around yourself you can

get if you move like five feet out from

the wall you can get all of them okay

that's what I'll do I'll just like

shuffle you like dragons and I'll cast

it at fifth level which gives them 5 5 d

8 reading

and so these spectral chickens flit

around you all around you and a ring

clucking as deep as they flap around

their spectral and appearance and let's

see obviously you don't want

evylyn to be affected by it know that

you can designate her out of the area

I'm sorry six right and so an affected

creature speed is halved in the area and

when it enters the area for the first

time on a Turner starts to turn there it

must make a saving throw okay great yes

this spell do you I'm sorry no sorry and

so much more

that's fits your niche it's your it's

your duty

exactly yeah you still somehow have the

stone of goal or incredible there's a

lot going on everybody's in this room

yeah just run to where space yes space

yeah well yeah if you would know that

Strix has as part of the plan you had a

back-up plan was the word of recall so

you know that she has that capability

yeah I know she has that but more

importantly we need it all to be

together yes yes that's why right now

and you see the chickens which is

usually the precursor to the word of

recall plan begins and then leave can

leave evil in from here yes since you're

in the doorway you can it I see her

dancing like a maniac she's never danced

before

yeah it's a little bit disturbing all

right oh man how familiar is DF with

three strings I don't think he's ever

really like really talk to him no I you

made your check you didn't recognize his

voice and he's in he's in disguise so

you don't even know really it's right

and that person you see he took someone

hostage who was that again so one of

Joel Axl's escorts

nice well you know he did kill a kid so

he's not gonna worry about some

grown-woman sort of language that you

get from this game get girl Axel's mics

here that damn Chris Perkins guy by the

way by the way just so you know you're

not the only one Jarl axel doesn't seem

to care that this wasn't taken hostage I

just assumed the woman was like secretly

a succubus or demon or something right

he wandered or hired so it's it's hard

for me to have sympathy for this being

no she's just paying her way through

college

yeah but there is demon in there and I

want to assist evil it but also maintain

distant okay so I'm going to take out

moon splinter and just try and like

holding a stone in one arm just throw a

moon splinter at the demon all right go

ahead and make your attack okay yeah

nothing too fancy here you have yeah you

actually have an advantage because the

demon is blinded oh snap all right great

thirteen third time boat yeah no yeah I

rolled a three twice in a row no your

dagger flies past it and returns to your

hand

yeah like Isuzu flies past like I

immediate like return to my hand but

I've tried it's hard to throw stuff

while I'm carrying a big old stone true

so with that I will use I use my cutting

action to disengage and then just kind

of reposition myself closer to Strix and

roof chickens great yeah so you can

disengage actually yeah so you can

easily get districts no problem there

yeah dome of goal or contacts you via

telepathy DF cool and suggests that if

you want its help now and in the future

that you should devote your attention to

a tuning it a tuning to it can this

stone hear my own thoughts back

yes okay I then that stone will hear the

IFS mine say does this seem like I have

time for that right now you hear it just

yours grumble in your mind this don't

you look Valerie's not wrong at the

Waffle House Oh nobody kids I'd like you

all to roll a d20 that includes marching

as well no Martin just got here 11:00

from that I rolled a one No okay

Martin got 17 wow that's pretty good

good

how did not do well actually not you

don't get to make a roll because you

can't hear mm there you know chest

losing its mind right now oh dear

sorry chat what about waffles I'll make

in the roll for waffles and protect our

baby there's already no roof okay

didn't we leave them with the babysitter

no all right so you kids have been

mucking around in the house you know the

upper two floors are kind of a disaster

area so that doesn't discourage you

necessarily from going up there and you

probably found Paul Tain's vampire

slippers and they're one of you is

probably mucking around in those maybe

let's say Jencks and is there any

wearing the slippers at this point or

using them as hand puppets yeah there

you go there you Simon is with you as

well and you've probably done something

very creative like oh I don't know

figured out how to mess with like the

chandelier in the common Hall okay and

so you're all kind of hanging off it you

wind it up you twist it around on its

chain and then you all hang on while it

spins and spins and spins around and you

see who can hold on the longest cool

squidly just probably launches off the

first yeah so jinkx is doing that and

just you know he's got Ferdinand it's

holding as well Albert and Albert and

the real Albert waffles is kind of down

on the floor in the corner kind of in an

ambush pose ready to jump on anybody who

falls off okay to catch them yeah being

is that the chicken foot coven is not

doing a very good job that's right they

were supposed to be babysitting exactly

yes they're downstairs probably you know

tending to stuff it's late so there

would be no customers at this hour right

okay all right and that Martin you hear

the sound of something heavy hit the

floor down below Martin right away she's

like sick

thanks thanks is like it's never us it's

usually a bad guy let's go check and

Jenks you're probably not even able to

walk straight cuz you've been spinning

around on the chandeliers yeah that's

kind of as you go to check you just kind

of walk into a door like globes the wand

like shoot some sparks like wow the

magic as the go downstairs Diaz will

either either squidly or not which

Everton the ones nearby like Miele come

up behind them and like do that thing

we're just like kind of hiding behind

him like holding onto the back of their

shirt just like NAT is signing to

squidly are you guys just trolling me

because I was winning at chandelier

yep and the best thing is not figured

out right away if she doesn't stay on

the outside of the chandelier but in the

middle and just changes her hand

positions she doesn't actually turn but

as you as you sort of peered down the

spiral staircase you hear a crash in the

kitchen Oh Jake shakes is like Bart's my

anyways make that noise that's like what

noise quickly you're the only one with

dark vision of the group as you peer

down you can see her lock the locks

Adhan lying unconscious on the floor oh

no he's big something Jake's is like

something bigs down there the big the

big elephant Mans then knocked over

cannot immediately use her burgeoning

rogue skills to look for clues reception

I guess yeah she can sneak down there

and poke around in the dark she rolled

it to okay

it's dark we have to go to the panic

room that strix told us about if

anything like this happens we need to go

to the panic room everyone gather up the

whole house isn't the panic room and he

just like gestures to Matt and like

Squidling is like time to go to the pave

restricts their rooms tricks his panic

room yep Rick says process I assumed

informed the kids that if there's a

reason to panic you go to her room

listen squidly reply says just like wow

we're taking a lot of action considering

I didn't actually convey any information

[Laughter]

just like that's right I forgot that

none of us are going to go to the panic

room now is like come children we should

go to the panic room and starts to act

all adult and try to go down there where

it's dark all right not something grabs

hold of you in the dark that's cool I

stabbed it Jarl Axl two abstracts

assesses out the scene

he will say very con yes he'll go oh

he'll - over with D F he'll disengage

from the current scene and stand next to

D F and strikes I am of course going

with you what is happening we're not his

buddy right I whispered now on the same

sadness huh I can't I'm too emotionally

overwhelmed to deal with this right now

you're going to do your what do you say

weld if we call Eaton

yes I am I'm coming with you I just like

look panicked Lee at D like I don't like

the word Terrell I'm all there nope Paul

- oh you are up next

you are the only member of the waffle

crew in the gathering Hall the woman

beside you is being held at knifepoint

although that kind of slackens wench or

Laxalt just takes off on her matram does

not seem to really want to hurt her and

that's kind of the only thing happening

in here uh well let's see Amalia is gone

you sent her you banished her away the

rest of the the rest of the auction

attendees have fled the room and are

pushing themselves out to their deaths

apparently cool and so yeah you're

basically now kind of there with matram

and this woman with your spilled mostly

empty wine fluke seems to be a lot more

chaos on the other room now mm-hmm I

look to it what was his name again matt

reum matt reum

I like to him I see him like kind of

loosely holding the ladies hostage and

it's like you uh he's still sticking

with that when she realizes she's not

being held very tightly she turns around

changes the foa the the feathered boa

into an actual boa constrictor snake oh

it's cool and throws it in matram face

and it becomes like oh and it

begins to coil around him almost

immediately and start to constrict him

function people are just throwing snakes

at this boy this again time stamp like

white like yeah four minutes this is

wild man Paul Ted and I didn't think

that's how did here we go what Paul can

what would you like to do when you see

the snake get hurled and Lipka if you

would be so great as to make an

initiative role for your character

that's a fair assessment to be honest my

memory yeah I feel necessarily alike

like in in cahoots with this guy am I

like oh no I need to help him because

reasons depends on how you feel about

the Harper's as an organization which

I'm not sure paulten has any particular

engagement with other than they did kind

of try to help Simon a little bit but

you know he doesn't remember that we

might not remember the details of that

because he was drunk

great thank you like look - he looks -

snake wrap wrapped around his head and

say wait hold on I got I got something

for this and he's gonna reach into his

pocket and like kick out a coin uh-huh

it looks to me just like alright call

calling after some confusion he says

tails okay as he's holding out the snake

by the neck and keeping its fangs away

from his face his head he's just

shouting tails tails that's all a snake

is need flipsies it's like alright

alright I mean I'm in let's let's let's

uh let's do something about this I'm

gonna try to just like I'll try to like

eat the snake off of them

alright just go ahead and

make a you're basically trying to

grapple it so roll a strength extrac oh

boy that is not good I love all paltin

no it just comes up with bits and

everyone just goes with it

dirty 20 okay that's actually good

enough you you grab the snake firmly

tear it off him and kind of toss it onto

the floor about five feet away and it

just starts to Rive and slow they're

about like holding it by its tail just

like spin around this little sure just

woosh woosh yeah you can do that you

spin it around kind of knocking matram

on the side of the head as you do thanks

for coming thanks dude and then you whip

it across the room and it just sort of

lands on one of the neck on one of the

other tables knocking over the ice

sculpture sending it shattering on the

floor and then as the snake rides around

all these glasses and wine glasses go

tinkling and smashing on the floor it's

actually quite a melodious sound for a

moment there uh-huh

til you realize it's a big constrictor

snake flailing around hmm nothing makes

an auction better than a bunch of snakes

would you like to move at all um apart

from that little spin you did to throw

the snake across the room yeah I'll just

kind of make sure the distance between

myself and the snake is greater than the

distance yeah cuz that that snakes

looking at you now it's like I'm just

kinda like are you moving closer to your

friends or farther away because you

really have that choice

I guess closer okay so you can probably

get even through the door into the

auction room at this point kind of

backing into the other room okay so I

just kind of back into the room yah turn

around alright what's going on over here

now that puts you near strid who is

still blind at this point in time so you

don't to provoke any hobbies from her

sister and awry what do you do you are

in the gathering hall with a snake a a

woman who's thrown the snake a a man who

is gratified that the snake isn't

crushing him to death and the blind

district

okay so wait so so and but paulten so

blind district got all the way over here

no she's still okay behind the register

it's like okay so near near me near the

other door where I just saw that dude

Wilhelm out the door

yes other people halten and hostage and

somebody else and the snake are all

right there

Alton's not there anymore paltin has

gone to join his friends so it's okay so

it's it's it's lady it's snake and now

other ladies snake another dude and mr.

Asia and lady and other dude are between

kind of between you and astrayed the

snake is off to the side okay great so

I'm just going to I mean ostensibly

since we're in the middle of a crowd

crush they wouldn't mind if I just moved

past them and found dis 'tried not at

all

okay you can get her easily so we get to

her easily I will grab her and say and

say the rogue has the stone what do you

suggest we do captain

she says they're going to go back to

their base they're going to go to ground

we must get there as quickly as possible

why don't we meet them set up and set up

a welcoming party for them she says we

already have and she'll pull out her

sending stone uh I I don't know exactly

what Sonny says it is it is basically a

rock that that is it's like a walkie

talkie it's connected to another similar

walk Rock and you can see the one and be

heard out the other you know who has the

other stone his name is Suraj the hunter

he is a half-orc with a big-ass bow

perfect do you think he'll meet Becca

you know that he is stationed in the

building directly across from the Waffle

House as I said to a stripper and she

says get us out of here

can I do that oh well I don't do I have

a thing that I can I'm on to the best of

your knowledge great all right um the

only daughter out is the one that

everyone is falling to all around

she's going to turn toward the door and

take a step and then look back at

history and and point pointedly through

walkie-talkie and pause and say make

sure he doesn't hurt the children with a

tiny almost imperceptible quiver of lip

she says

Siraj they're coming home don't hurt the

children thank you no let's get out and

grabbing Astrid we're going to move I

don't I don't exactly know how a

teleportation circle works does it just

kind of go in and click and go or no but

you need a spell to activate it great

okay well as a not not particular spell

caster do we see is there anybody

the auctioneer could have done it he's

he's bleeding out on the auction stage

is anyone else teleporting out or is it

just him nobody else all right all right

oh Jesus I know how we have to get out

of here the staff exit all right I'm

going to I'm going to say the only other

way out could be back through the

auction room to the other side unless

you know better

she says I'm blind get me out of here

okay um so he's going to grab miss

'tried oh wait

yo okay hang on so if we're if it abuts

the edge of a building I could in theory

slow fall it down okay I'm gonna try and

I'm gonna take it straight and start

making my way to the edge okay in that

case just make a strength roll strength

athletics to push your way through

people in your way so that you can get

there by the end of your turn um I'll do

that otherwise if you won't be able to

get there by the end of your turn yep

all its since you're pulling mr. it

along with you I won't be able to get

there by the end my turn I rolled a hey

I rolled like an eight or something or

athletics African I use acrobatics uh

yeah thirteen okay that's enough you can

get there when you get to the doorway

you've kind of pushed people out of the

way you see that the door opens in the

side of what looks like a gigantic stone

sphere that is suspended in the air

above water deep over a gigantic statues

hand so if you imagine you're inside a

hollow sphere yes on top of the Statue

of Liberty's torch yeah basically okay

and so you're coming out on the equator

of this stone orb and you can see the

rooftops of the city below

and this 90-foot tall statue that's

under this orb has buildings actually

built up and around it how close are we

to the hand it's about a 20-foot drop to

one of her fingers shadowstep

all right you disappear and appear on

one of its fingers okay witness 'tried I

would like you now to make a strength

check okay oh yeah that will be sixteen

strid slips with her metal boots on the

smooth stone of the finger but you

managed to grab her before she falls out

of your grasp and that's your turn great

and and I

assumingly assuming unless anything else

happens you can just ghost me and

yesterday I will shadow step our way to

toward the Waffle House that's what yeah

yeah okay I will hang out all right

evylyn I still got a demon deal with ya

he's black it's blind he's badly hurt

though I am this groove in your feet oh

yes you've got that it'll take an action

to make a wisdom saving throw to end

that she has no interest in ending that

then you can't then you can't do

anything well you could attack I mean

yeah if it's within range of you you can

attack which it is right yeah that's

mainly right you absolutely can water

what I meant is you can't move like dear

friends or anything I also my my

sunbeams fellas concentration would this

have broken my concentration oh that's a

very good question

nope

you saw concentration so you could fire

off another beam if you wanted to and

just to clarify there are two other

baddies still in the room yes there's

well there's the half work and the the

Sun elf are they are they still lined up

they are yes and just I I'm trying Anna

is trying to keep track for evylyn but

doing a bad job

evylyn is certain these guys are baddies

or would she feel some of the compassion

of the morning Lord toward them

they've you have had a date aunt with

the Santarem on and off throughout your

being in water deep but their their

actions here seem to be more hostile

than you've seen them before

alright now granted Yara the half-orc is

currently blinded and that the Sun elf

does look like he's pretty badly damaged

so you have some pity for them in that

regard can can she dialogue with them

really quick and be like repent now in

the light of the morning Lord and be

spared his wrath sure go ahead and make

a persuasion check or intimidation if

you prefer persuasion not 20

oh

yeah Girish outs to dabble that sounds

like a pretty good idea to me right now

and devil says I am forced to concur the

morning Lord smiles upon you in His

mercy watch as i smite those who would

resist him at the devil only alright you

he has disadvantage on this save me

throw he fails go ahead and give me the

damages yes

24 you reduce the devil to ash that just

flies all over the room there's nothing

left of it as the ash rains down on even

beautiful golden curls now join me in

pray the other two still dancing this is

unfortunate see the the next turn goes

to the black Viper vivica you are in the

Waffle House you've just caught this

young girl in the darkness after

incapacitating all of the babysitter's

you don't see any sign of the waffle

crew but you're aware that the waffle

crew has basically made this girl and

the other kids that you can hear

upstairs they're wards how many kids so

you you don't remember this young girl's

name but she's about 13 years old long

dark hair you often see here with like a

wooden sword she seems to be a very

confident young currently trying to stab

you with a real day and it's currently

trying to stab you with a real dagger

which is new that's new you don't

remember that before so so maybe this

whole hanging out with the waffle crew

thing isn't such a good idea but the

other kids you recall one of them is a

small little tiefling boy the other is a

human boy and then there's one who's a

puppet basically a living talking puppet

child-sized and you're on the ground

floor in the store of the Waffle House

where they sell pastries under glass

there is a spiral staircase going

upstairs to the residential part of

their abode and that's where you hear

the other kids alright and you are Viper

so I'm going to take up one of my

microphone things off of my thigh and

just kind of like like parry the blade

and just push it forward to be like

where are your Guardians your guard

myself lady guardians is a strong word

for what they have and what you seen at

is this beautiful woman wearing a black

mask to hide her face obviously dressed

like a a rogue or a thief

all in black with a hood to hide her

head she's not signing to all the other

kids bad guy bad guy I mean that's kind

of up for debate I wouldn't really say

that you're not sure what this this

young girl is saying she's just sort of

giving a hand sign up into the well I

feel like you're trying to say that I'm

mad and I'm arbitrarily taken offense oh

it's a good yep what so I know that the

rest of the waffle crew is at the

auction yes and you were you are going

to wait for them here when you were kind

of accosted by some people you didn't

expect to see so you kind of took them

all out and now you're being beset by

this kid this is not how you plan to

spend your evening but so I I I kind of

as I'm pushing on on there her dagger I

sweep over grabbed her wrist and then

take the dagger out of her hand

okay and then lean over and with with a

with a sense of superiority just lightly

pat on the top of her head Wow

it looks like she might fight you know I

internalized that and I'd say I'd like

to see you try yeah but I she's like she

looks around she's like waffle crew or

cricket cakes I need one of the two all

right it's like don't tell her anything

never surrender she's washing her

squigglies just kind of like just around

the intruder just trying to quietly like

spread out leftover gunpowder

there's no gunpowder left on left so is

he using sugar probably like regular

pepper yeah so he's like pepper in your

feet yeah so this little tiefling boy is

destroying pepper around on the floor

I'm rolling around looking at all of

these kids doing all of these strange

things around me and I think to myself

that I must be the absolute worst dumpy

person possible that I hate all of you

and everybody heard if you didn't have

if you didn't have to render three

people unconscious it probably would

have gone a lot smoother I gently step

over the three people and do a

delightful little hop over the ring of

actual cover yes I I start making my way

up to the spiral staircase to the

residential area it's kind of looking

for route

so Jenks is hiding in the panic room so

you you make your way up the spiral

staircase leaving the girl and the teef

laying down below you at the top of the

stairs you can see a young boy two young

boys you haven't seen before both look

to be about the same age same size one

looks very thin and nervous and the

other one doesn't say anything but just

sort of

you a evil look oh no a menacing hateful

glare also as she walks away pollen will

like stay in pursuit you know it's on

the move now when you get to the top of

the staircase you are greeted by a

snarling owl bear yeah that's a bit

bigger than the kids yes so so it's kind

of like the two kids and then a little

bit I was like yep okay so downstairs I

just saw a kid that wouldn't speak that

was signing and someone who is just

throwing pepper at me so I don't have a

better shot with these I kind of leaned

down a little bit not too far because I

don't trust anything in this house well

I leaned down a little bit be like where

are the Guardians so what the big people

we're not your parents the roof the

waffle group the D and strict and happy

one and one with the chair you said you

said you said not your parents and that

that's factually incorrect throughout

the auction yeah we're not going to tell

you they're at the auction well Eileen

oh well I didn't hear that and I

certainly don't know that they're at the

auction but would it be all do not hear

that I just yelled it at you are you

deaf

she's here maybe you're jinx go I

definitely told you not to say that here

boys like we're compromised now

let's try and shoot my hair go ahead

roll a d20 that's an 8 okay yeah this

this arrow comes at you black Viper and

you just sort of catch it I like it

comes at me and I still have my eyes and

the kids and I just use the little knife

that I think No

that comes from behind at this point and

does that thing that kids think is funny

when they hit the back of your knees to

make you let go like that right but it

turns out actually you're you're more

than a match for these children

you're a Yorkie you're cat-like reflexes

probably actually kind of as the kids

are going after her and and that when

you go behind her and and sort of tried

to take her out of the knees Simon tries

to shove her as if you know she's gonna

buckle and then she can send her

tumbling down the stairs but heroes

heroes innate so that doesn't work so

well so as they're trying to make your

knees buckle and push you down the

stairs and shoot you with arrows you

just you just kind of deflect them all

away and hold your ground yeah I am I

feel the knees buckle and I feel the

push and I duck and dodge and I jump

from where I am kind of doing I like a

perk or burger or like leap off of the

side of the stair ball behind what's his

name yes so I'm like behind that and I

reach down and I wedgie establishing

dominance I just walk back down the

stair find a chair that looks like it

won't throw me off or eat me that would

be the estrade Vaughn chair of itch this

no regular chair all right you avoid

that chair and you find is the common

steady chair yeah back at the show

matram three strings the harper agent

who's still in his full disguise

although probably with the snake and

everything his mask has come off he'll

make his way to the doorway to where the

waffle crew so he can see the waffle

crew in the auction house and he looks

at you with his mask on he looks at you

and says give me the stone and I'll make

sure it's safe

this is a Harper guy right so now that I

see him huh I don't recall how much does

the ethno matram you know only that he

came to the house once and said he was

working with the Harper's but that's

that's out oh that's all you know and

you only have his word

you have no corroboration right so and

you also know that he he told paltin

that the loot that paltin stole was a

surveillance device

uh-huh which is also you know just fish

right and you're about ten feet away

from him so you'd have to like toss him

the stone but yeah indeed just like how

do I know I could trust you he will

it'll he'll he'll throw off his the robe

so that you can see he's armored

underneath and he has got a small pin on

his lapel that is shaped like a silver

harp many points to it great again in

context what does that mean to DF though

you don't know it's a nice pin yeah

Santi dollar facade Allah had one like

it yeah I remember how that turned out

yeah matram doesn't know that yeah

yeah yeah I guess like the only

correlation that dia --then have for

that pin would just be sandala which

didn't turn out great for him so I guess

I just tried to say something along

lines of fire me later and Waterdeep

we'll meet up then okay all right

he says we're in water deep where you

know what I mean like what actual water

deep semantic all right

also worm I don't didn't check but are

my chickens doing any damage yet yes

they would do well let's see who's still

in the room well the Devils gone okay

mister it's gone dabble and yagura have

both kind of converted to the worship of

they're just confused

yeah they see his true power and grace

and mercy there's still pick up their

feet all right

the let's see nobody's there Castle

enter his wife you hear vittorio castle

enter out in the calling his wife's name

none of you can see him because he's out

of view but he's he's calling for his

wife it doesn't know where she's gone

yeah no one does yeah and then Strix

what do you do and now I see everyone

including yes eternal axel correct I

still make eyes ideas I'm like I would

take it home like I'll do

well I'll make eyes at her back like

nope okay all right so I mean she

doesn't do that she just looks more

scared she's like I get it

and yeah I'll cast the recall spell

right

evylyn Paulson myself India and kind of

mouth I'm sorry to Charlie all right

send you all four of you disappear

I guess vanishing yes we'll take one

last look over total axle and we'll say

something such as we stopped being

allies the moment you used us for murder

fair as evylyn starts to disappear she

says seek the face of the morning Lord

and you shall be what does Alton say

peace out scrub all right you all appear

in the panic room of the Waffle House

and Jenks is there looking out he was

looking out the door out into the hall

but as soon as you appear behind him he

turns around throws himself up against

the door panic going when everyone is

there I say up there's a bad guy in the

house is evil instilled in times like I

just spell it immediately well you you

have to cast that spell though damn it

and you just took your spell turn yeah

me too though that would have been a

waste martyrs polycast deaath what do

you do when you appear in the room this

is okay this is on the second floor of

the house you can hear there's obviously

a ruckus the kids are not all right not

the second floor that's right don't have

any hiding places I'm gonna take I'm

gonna take the first thing I'm gonna

take the stone and stash it somewhere in

Stricker's room that's the next room

over basically yeah all right or in the

panic room or wherever well you're in

the panic room

yes and which doubles as the kids

bedroom the problem with this room is

there is a door to an outside balcony so

it's not the most absolutely a great

panic room okay it's that one yeah so

the hall is outside just a quick

question

don't doesn't Diaz have a bag of holding

yes needs put it in there that's a

question but it's still on me on my

person that's true but it can't be

detected that's true while it's in the

bag it's in an extra dimensional space

exactly all right she dances like strix

that's a good idea I think it's better

that you keep an eye on it we never know

who could come in the house lately it

can't be detected if it's in the bag of

holding all right fine I'll put it in

the bag all right give it to me I have

the ability to just disappear and escape

a million different ways what does

Bolton notice Paulsen I could smash that

okay maybe not evylyn yeah I'll put the

stone into the bag of holding right away

and then I'm gonna give that stone

another bag get the bag de Polan yeah

and just be like no matter what make

sure no one gets this all right yeah

yeah so he gives you his purse his

little satchel treat it like wine paltin

oh my god this is so cute anything else

you want to do death because basically

putting that thing in and giving it to

paltin doesn't really count as an action

okay and then I guess I've turned back

to Marta min Jenks and be like where's

this dangerous person good Jenks is like

died they were all there a lady with a

mask and they look like they were they

had like tall boots chase just like

slowly puts his hand over merchants

mouse's that's allowed that way you

solve your move death yeah death will

cut we'll look back at the others and

just kind of let's be like everyone be

careful and we'll make his way down a

steer

yeah you can go past waffles down the

stairs and that's when you see this

cloaked woman that you last glimpsed at

the Marg Astor party sitting in the

middle of the tap room I'm sitting in a

chair but like sideways so I'm have like

legs kind of like bouncing and I have

the little dagger that I took and I'm

like bounce it on its blade like on my

finger I look up and see you and I go I

[Laughter]

remember you I'm evil and you don't see

that yet because you're still up in the

panic room I'm just kidding so it is the

kids turn if any if you don't have to do

anything but if you if you're playing a

kid and you want the kid or something

can natte wants to try to knock the

dagger off your finger

oh sure go ahead and roll a d20 and

Vivica you'll roll your dexterity

acrobatics kid I like that it sounds

like you're just dropping up body on the

how'd you do their net 924 okay so I

imagine that what happens is vipers

making her grand like entrance and that

just goes like in and out of frame

swilley's gonna like just try and like

so you're like sitting right now in the

chair right yeah I'm like sitting

sideways I have my leg legs crossed up

incredibly bouncy and obviously cool

squigglies gonna try and like bull

charged one of his horns just like into

your shin okay go ahead and make an

attack roll just roll a d20 squiggly yes

cool that's a six okay

all the kids are just like and a few you

can see per lock lying unconscious on

the floor in the doorway of the kitchen

you can see critter lying unconscious on

the floor our poor common oh yeah it's

right away it's just like squiggly net

enough stand down now they're like on

high alert especially seeing like the

chicken coven like unconscious and

attacked that wasn't really my fault

they kind of attacked me first

d/f what's your armor class why it's 19

okay it's 19 I got the badge on okay

easy the killing one oh you are struck

twice I knew this was gonna buy what

what you see black Viper and what other

people in the room see which would be

NAT and squiggly and Martin and Simon

two bolts are two arrows huge Aaron's

much bigger than normal arrows come math

out of the darkness and strike death

twice one of them hits him for 22 points

of damage

am I still not there you're still not

there and the other one hits you for 28

points of damage so a total of 50 points

of damage and so and yep right there

right there DF it's just like kids stand

down black rapper you have no reason to

shock so he'll he'll hit get hate the

first one because he wasn't expecting it

but why this one he's a little more

prepared he's gonna uncanny dodge the

odd the one but still like kind of

collapse to the floor very very injured

all right so you take a total of 36

points of damage then from the two bolts

as the second one sort of Gallants is at

you the first one stuck in you really

good the second one kind of went through

you a little bit and squidly you see the

bolt go through the back wall like the

wall isn't there cool

I'm like I want to like go after the

bolt and like I just want that well that

you walk into the wall yeah is the hole

like not big enough to like there's no

hole it it goes through and does not

it's like the wall isn't there oh okay I

still try a go and I just walk into the

wall oh my first assumption just like Oh

fake wall ow

coming up out of the cellar are two drow

whoo pop up from the trapdoor behind the

bar one of them goes over to squidly

know our Minotaur is not doing his job

oops he tried to and no squiggly you are

foisted up off by the scruff of your

your cloak picked up off by this this

dark elf who looks at you with these red

eyes is skin just sort of a charcoal

color the other one squeal he's like

flailing but being held it just like

yeah wait turn back around

alright we're coming back we're coming

back the other one takes aim with its

crossbow at the black Viper and rolls a

14 on the attack roll which is gonna

miss you you dodged out of the way of

this bolt but yeah I see the elf come up

I died the way I do sit I definitely get

up off out of the chair now and I'm

pointing like paltin you're upstairs in

the

a chrome and I was just given the the

bag of holding yeah

do I hear this commotion downstairs oh

yes

okay I'm going to tie it very tightly to

me in a way that you know I'm gonna like

tie it but then like stuff it down the

front of my pants so it's okay there's a

huge Dow bulge in the front of your

pants cool I just want to make sure that

if it is taken go on kinds of burns

today

whoof okay so anyway and he's gonna make

his way down there all right what's

going on palton for imps turn visible

around you and try to sting you with

their stingers Oh what try to do man

or little winged Devils little winged

Devils with scorpion tails come at you

one of them crit you and then one other

hit you the other two missed the one

that crit you does 10 piercing damage

okay the other one does c+ 10 poison or

sorry you have to make save me throw

hyena

let's do this one at a time you take 10

poison damage that's a lie no you know I

got this I got this I haven't lost it

this is the crit you take 10 from the

stinger that's good now make a

constitution saving throw okay

14 okay that's good enough you don't get

the poison that it tries to inject in

you doesn't do anything to you the other

one does five damage to you with its

stinger so that's 15 total and you have

to make a second Constitution saving

throw

so 15 so 15 total all right

whoof

9 then you take another 10 from the

poison okay and actually you take half

damage on a failed save so you take

another 15 so you've taken a total of 30

points of damage from these imps okay

and what was the the well actually no

I'm gonna I'm gonna cutting words and

try and knock some damage off of that so

um - so you take two off yep okay so you

take 28 points of damage neat and you've

got these four imps all after you and

they sort of clutch ineffectually at

your crotch as they sting you those

fingers are coated cisterna rai your

your shadow stepping your way down this

statue astrid is no longer blind so you

don't have to hold on the only you don't

have to worry about her becoming

disoriented as you make your way down

okay you're able to climb down a lot

either sort of half jumping half shadow

stepping down these buildings built into

this statue that looks like the statue

is quite old and it's got chips out of

its its granite sides and things like

that and there plenty of hand holds and

catwalks and walkways and staircases

that you can make your way down I'm

gonna say you get down to the bottom of

the structure by the end of your turn

but you're having a tough she's having a

tough time keeping up to you because a

she's a dwarf be she's armored and she

says go ahead without me

all

call in backup if you can from what I

know of these idiots and the kind of

people they keep company with we're

bound not to be the only ones looking

for them tonight you're gonna be man

soon okay Holly

evylyn no pastries I'm just a human

without dark vision I can't see through

all this shade dude from from

what narai remembers you guys were

having an under-the-table party like it

was Thanksgiving and you were like okay

so what if we brought mansion in here

that'd be a good distraction right and I

don't know it's a confidence thing

because it works so well evil and I hear

this commotion in the other I'm here dad

and you're dancing to a beat that only

you can hear dances out dad did that um

and she takes in all of these threats

the archer is unwell actually when

you're dancing you can't use any of your

movement to do anything else so you

can't leave the room until you decide to

use your action to make this saving

throw she's like all right dance and

feet don't go too far now and then she

tries to stop dancing okay

it's a wisdom saving through my rolls

are so bad tonight um 13 not quite

that's like oh you just got the music

deep in you don't you do but you can

still talk you can call out to them and

you know I can't stop dancing but as

soon as I can I'll be there to help come

in here if you need any healing all

right black Viper what do you do there

are two Dark Elves in the tap room with

you and the kids

d/f has sort of tumbled up against the

counter and he's got a very very nasty

arrow sticking in him I do

like so did the two arrows come from the

drow No

they came from God well you sort of

looked to see where they came from and

you don't see the shooter you sort of

follow the trajectory you're just

looking at the wall of the the tavern

there's nobody there but I was able to

decipher that it wasn't from dad it's

from else correct yes these dark dots

appear to be a totally different threat

do do I know of the imps upstairs you

hear the sound of some distress upstairs

from a certain paltin SEPA but you don't

know what's he's dealing with

everybody's here what a great party what

a good time so yeah I jump up from the

chair and I keep a mental note of kind

of where I saw those bolts coming from

and I'm trying to kind of steer clear of

that if I can keep anything kind of in

between us or just do the best I can but

how many how many draw are there two to

one has got the small little devil boy

by the scruff yeah the other one took a

shot at you and missed known as a mature

chattering all right you sort of flip

yourself over parkour over the

countertop with the pastries yeah and

I'm going to I'm gonna do some attacks

all right all right so oh that first one

internet 20 thank you very much

excellent you overall double-double the

dice so it'll be 2d six with your rapier

excellent shooting six of the bench

inside and I'm gonna do the three

attacks okay all right

unfortunately you can't use your sneak

attack because you're not near an ally

but you get your yield roll regular

damage yeah um yeah I was just doing

that multi attack not sneaking correct

yeah

but yeah the other two unfortunately was

a nine and an 18 18 is it excellence all

right to us and one of them one of them

double it because you're creating it

double oh oh oh the first one is um

let's see the see that see that's a 12

okay and the second one is a 10 very

good that Dark Elf falls and also a side

note that when I went in and started

doing my uh my rapier slashing I needed

the kid flip them off okay very good

freaking monsters indeed that's the

black Viper these guys are out this

guy's out she's out I'm Patrick

he's out tricks Strix yeah it's my turn

yeah I don't know I think I'm by the

Imps you're closer to the imps than

anything else when you walk out into the

hall you see palton being beset by these

four little creatures I want to look at

everything I want to assess everything

else - there's a waffles here - you're

albear okay Alton ari are you okay not

really

okay I'm just like whoa all right um

these are amps so let's see what fun

stuff we can do this though so they're

not really gonna affect anything with

like is I heard no no please yeah take

time you know that you know that imps

are immune to fire and poisons something

yeah you know that they're resistant to

cold and weapon attacks that aren't

magical or silvered right of course

so let's see I think hmm you know

anything I'm gonna do I'm gonna cast

protection from evil on Paulsen okay

which causes the imps to get

disadvantaged on their roles against

great that's awesome so and then I'm

going to Emily you're anathema to them

Paul tonic yeah

so Rick's is like it's not you they go

up and they like reach for my crotch and

start Patti and they're just like pretty

much yeah I still want to if I can like

see can I look over the

or tall waffles like like why waffles

get them huh she goes right out of you

yeah so I will I tell her to go I tell

her to go like after the the Imps got it

yeah and then I'm gonna if I can't I

don't I don't have any movement left so

I was gonna run okay I'm gonna run down

the stairs okay when you get to the

stairs you can see there is a Dark Elf

holding squidly you see a woman in a

mask with a cowl hiding hiding her face

you see DF has a nasty bolt arrow stuck

in him that's what I was excited it

looks like the same kind of arrow that

was stuck in palton back on the ship

when he took your broom right okay I

recognize that in that case then I'm

going to quick and spell and make a

bonus action out of how far out damn

Annette's touch I can't do it that far

well I can do one not that not that not

that not that

wait I'm trying to find the right one I

have all these new ones for my staff

when it gets confusing I can't really do

that either you know what I'm just gonna

summon the the chickens again so you

cast the protection from from each spell

that was your action yeah and then I can

I can do quick and spa with my sorcery

points so and then you want the chickens

around you you're at you're on the

staircase right now the drought will be

in the area however ooh ooh cool no wait

I have something better okay um I'm

gonna summon an elemental oh my goodness

I'm gonna conjure an elemental okay -

more or less just like stand in front of

death just next to him what sign

developmental oh I think don't a chicken

feather oh no chickens are creatures

they're not elemental is Elmo's like

some

that's an Engel event oh yeah so as the

be cast the spell using spells a lot of

six level or higher the challenge rating

increased by one so I get I don't know

what kind of like element cuz this is

from the staff so dangerous house this

is conjure elemental not contra minor

elemental right no it's conjure

elemental yeah so it's a yeah so great

you can summon a fire elemental a earth

elemental a air elemental or a water

elemental okay I'll make it an earth

elemental so it's pretty much just using

it as a wall like next to do all right

an elemental appears next to DF it's

it's it's made of Earth but it's it's

it's still a chicken yeah it's just an

earth chicken you see it sort of splits

the boards under its feet with its

immense weight as it stands protectively

over UDF this great stone wall with

fists alright waffles waffles is going

to go after one of the imps trying to

bite it she roll the one on the bite

that's not so good then she's gonna

swipe it one with her claws that has

greater success she's able to hit it

with her claws they'll do half damage

but it's still enough to kill the little

critter because she rolled really well

on her damage yeah good job so she could

kind of jumps up and down on it until

she squishes it flat then she tears his

little wings off no no D F you're up

okay well pretty hurt I was gonna kind

of stay down get cover from these weird

bolts but now there's an earth elemental

there I guess I'll just from there stand

up and get a quick survey of the land to

try to remember what that's even

happening okay you stand up you kind of

look around there's bigger othello

mental in your way the biggest thing you

notice that's an obvious impressive

Rett is the drow holding squidly alright

yeah can't do that I'm threatened the

children yeah so from there I guess

death will basically kind of like roll

over the counter to get to the other

side withdrawing gutter and trying to

engage this drought with squidly great

you have because squidly is your ally

you get your sneak attack

yeah yes could be distract them just

like flail around loudly is doing a

great distraction

yeah if I can kind of screwed Lee to do

one thing it's that yeah he like spits

on his face

gross seventeen that hits ie alright

gotta get all my idol champions D sixes

ma'am this is gonna be a lot okay 21

look forward 27 30 31 36 you eviscerate

that Dark Elf who falls dead yeah just

like a real clean like slight slice

across the throat yeah

and let's greatly drop to the floor okay

that won't traumatize anyone he's he

horse yeah he's seen worse

yikes do they do any of the kids want to

do anything on their turn yeah I'm gonna

I'm gonna Ram that dude pick me up in

the shits okay since he's dead he's not

gonna do anything except take it that

doesn't doesn't matter he's he's gonna

kick kick kick kick kick him nice nice I

imagine matram is too scared to do

anything

probably the Wiener now try to throw a

dagger at the most present enemy either

threatening death or squidly currently

there is none so she'll just actually go

stand in a protective stance next to

death and hold action with her dagger

okay Jake's is

Thanks is gonna peek out the door and

with his little wand that can turn

objects can he turn the Imps into

something they're not objects no see

it's only inanimate objects yeah

all right um well he's just a stand

protectively outside the door with his

wand then and watch these amps around

Carlton all right Simon Simon since I'm

Simon's not gonna stand there and let

Paul and I get accosted by these things

Simon is going to try to grab one of

them oh my god he successfully manages

to grab a nip and and hang on to it

feverishly while this imp claws and

scratches at him and he actually takes

the mpany bashes it against a wall

that's my boy

and the IMP is kind of dazed and reeling

from it but you see the walls not doing

a whole lot of damage to it but I will

I'll say the mtech a point of damage

from the beating most of the damage was

like an ocean exactly

and now the walls all stretched out yes

HOAs gonna have a fit oh not the wall

paltin yes two arrows come through the

wall of course and tried to hit you the

first one is a 26 hold on let me check

this is important these arrows coming

from an evil source wait yeah cuz the

bigot did a disadvantage mmm let's see

about that

it's pretty evil creatures of those

types have a disadvantage well he's not

one of those types so he's fine well

these are neutral arrows we narrow down

he okay that was our plan all along so

the first one does 24 points of damage

to you okay cool I'm going to

react to that with my reaction hold

cutting words very good okay this time

big money big money

seven okay so take that off okay what

was the total again what do I say uh uh

eight oh I forgot I'm after all again

2424 that's okay twenty-four so fine at

seven okay seventeen okay the second one

is a natural twenty is it though well so

hmm yeah I keep rolling around dice on

me I'm sure this would have happened

even if I didn't give you the bag I'm

sure mm-hmm

so yeah you take that 38 points of

damage cool so I'm down as well yeah so

uh for everyone in chat wondering why he

gave it to me and not Strix it's because

I know you could turn invisible you've

got like your fake Politan you can make

run away you have all these tricks to do

things to get away yeah

down down in the basement d/f and black

Viper you hear a voice speaking in some

sort of under combination language I

don't know if I have every speak under

common a subterranean language erupts

from the depths and suddenly the tap

room is full of rubbery black tentacles

no no it isn't paltin you're at white

you get a death saved my friend Oh needs

this would be a great time for one of

those 2000 uh-huh

alas it's a 12 okay so that's that's a

save that's one success you'll want to

record that for next week okay oh good

just toss a card

[Laughter]

all right and the after you fall the

imps all turn on Simon and

paltin the last thing you see is as

Simon is bashing this thing and stepping

on its head to other imps come up and

try to sting him from behind well soon

he's hit both times and he falls down

beside you and he just sort of stares at

you for a moment and then you see the

life leave his eyes just ok I can fix it

passing unconscious just like looking at

him laying our sides just like put one

hand just on his face like you did good

son I don't like being dead all week

ok I can fix it a quick question in

between all this horror if we had taken

Joel axle whatever the drow not been

there correct for every reaction yeah I

love that is a great mechanic but I hate

that we up you know it's six of

one half dozen of the other

of mostly evil right murder yeah but but
