everybody welcome to dice camera action

yes waffle crew awesomeness so let's see

where were we oh yes I remember

you guys were reunited with your

stalwart companion Strix he returned

after being summoned away by an infernal

contract and she told you a little bit

about her exploits in the faraway land

of chalte and you realized that your own

vessel your own airship wasn't going to

get you there fast enough to save paltin

and so DF gave up his ring of protection

which appeared on his finger after

evylyn made the ultimate sacrifice to

protect him from the death curse and

that seems to have staved off the deaths

course the death curses effect but has

now left DF vulnerable to its effects

without the ring to protect him

DF used the key and his sword to summon

shemekka the Marauder a powerful our

cattle off from the city of sigil and

petitioned her to use a teleport spell

to transport you all instantaneously to

child thus leaving the airship behind

however she can only transport eight of

you and with the four members of the

waffle crew and waffles and Simon and

juniper that's seven plus one extra slot

which at the end of last week's session

you decided was going to go to artists

Cimber leaving behind sir Godfrey Willem

summer wise and captains and ala and

that would have been so bad except now

arising out of the clouds toward the

ship in hot pursuit

huh is a red dragon of enormous size

bigger than the airship itself and DF

you're the only one it what do you do if

I see it the first thing that Deus will

do will probably turn to sound Allah in

a sort of realization anger these

squinting eyes just be like you let him

hear

and then I'll really turned the party's

attention to said red dragon all right

now you are all aware of the big red

dragon flying behind and below you

getting closer Oh God then turn back to

shim Eska who last I recalled we were

working out a deal to get us off this

ship yes the the specifics of that were

you would subject yourself D F to engage

spell a magical compulsion

extraordinarily powerful one that would

compel you to retrieve an item for her a

pair of spectacles and if possible a

spell book and for that she was going to

transport you and she's prepared to do

it immediately great but it sounds

stupid

don't do it we'd rather stay here the

red dragon anyone else with reasonable

objections I'm sure we can fight it off

wait did I just hear red dragon yes what

and now you sort of throw yourself up

against the railing and look back toward

the after the ship and down and yes

coming up through the clouds below you

is this jumbo jet sized reptile just

make that face and not safe and then

your hat almost gets ripped off your

head by the way you're like touching

I'm stir it's fine I just got here I

don't want to die we're technically

still an initiative so DF is there

anything that you would like to do with

your action um I'm going to dodge not on

Kenny dodge just using dodge just so

that dodging it's no action defensive

action you can take so if someone

happens to attack you until your next

turn they have disadvantage on their

attack roles some be prepared to keep

some no he's just dodging all of

this diamond on Kenny dodge just regular

type all right general Danny yeah Polson

your turn comes up what would you like

to do okay I'd all right

dragon dying trying to get us out of

here

so are we are we just trying to are we

just trying to book it or we just

channel leaver

all of the above

cool I'm gonna wait to see what the part

was all right just paralyzed waiting for

the party the rest of the party to act I

turn to my son yeah I'm in good boy

alright he's standing behind beside you

he'll he'll sort of grab your hand and

then

evylyn your turn comes up and you you

know that sort of the appearance of the

dragon has made the the plan that you

sort of worked out a little bit

problematic because rather than Assurant

you don't know what will happen to those

you leave behind before they could have

just landed the ship and great gone on

with their lives or whatever but we

can't leave everyone here to die we have

to make a stand honestly at this point

evylyn you not sure what the Dragons

actual and

tensions are it's just zooming in toward

the ship maybe he just wants to have a

little party with us up here in the sky

dragon what's up buddy

and Allah is is like looking at artists

like he wants that thing that's all he

wants and like like like giving him eyes

like like that ring is your doom dude

just you know from a crossbow you know

this dragon person are you guys pals who

you ask

Zhaan Dallas says he sure thinks I'm a

pal but no no is he going to roast us in

this airship and if so should we try to

land right now uh well I mean I think

yeah he likes the ship but he has

feelings about the ship so he might not

destroy the ship but all the people on

it I have no clue I wouldn't speak for

him gondolas and all you know enough

about red dragons to know their general

demeanor and you know cloth well enough

to knows his specific demeanor in many

ways he's the archetypal red dragon he

is vainglorious ultimately egotistical

supremely confident and chaotic evil to

his fiery core okay which makes him

unpredictable great gotcha yeah yeah I'm

gonna stick with my my I'm not gonna

speak for him I have no idea what he's

gonna do all right well I can't reach

the dragon and I can't really do

anything to like protect any one person

specifically so I'm gonna I'm just gonna

cast a little a little bless the note

the first level spells are we dedicate

our souls to the great holy morning Lord

and ask his blessing upon us as we face

whatever comes next be it friend or be

it folk may he bless us and pour down

his holy

upon our souls okay if you cast it using

a first-level slot you can benefit three

creatures but every slot you use that's

higher than first grants you an

additional creature to protect

so what slot spell would you like to use

you can get five people I'm going to

protect all of my party yep

and some dolla and I don't squint at me

Jarrod even still think she's a friend

and waffles that's it then Oh Oh waffles

are Simon ooh wow or artist artist is

there to or care of himself not son

dollar yeah you know what evylyn would

think of her party first as including

simon okay so she would do simon instead

alright so basically your core party

yeah

all get the blessing of love and juniper

goes in there's a little compartment

even though she doesn't get a blessing

but she's in in there is act like

there's something sticky unmanly alright

and that's

evylyn artists will go next

so just so everyone knows that means

that when you make an attack role or

saving throw you can roll a d4 and add

that number right oh great that saving

throw apart probably will be important

okay

artists will draw his tiny little pajama

dagger you see him not really fumble

with it but he kind of twists something

in it something spills out on his hand

and he slips it on his finger and then

in a moment before he puts his glove

back on you see he has now donned the

ring still want that and he moves closer

to shemekka

fine alright say anything Chris not at

this time when last we spoke she was

ready to cast the teleport spell

basically when you whenever you wanted

she does not seem deeply troubled by the

presence of the dragon she doesn't it's

clear from her is troubled that she's

missing her party though it is very much

so yes last week but you can see that

every her calmness belies her confidence

that she will leave this ship before the

dragon gets too close and then Strix

what do you do with your action I'm just

against the railing just going to look

I'm just gonna look at Somesh gun and

see like can we leave now and she will

turn and sort of nod toward the death

and say depends on me why I need him to

commit to the case boom that's right and

you won't do it to me because apparently

all these bad things are going to happen

to me that's fine I'm just gonna get on

my broom okay and just like ready myself

to just like bail I'm just like alright

the funny thing about getting on your

broom aboard a moving ship is that you

kind of have to focus on staying on the

ship that's true

am I just gonna get on the room and then

just tumble back well no I mean the ship

will move away underneath you unless you

you know basically concentrate on

keeping you in the broom on the deck

okay I'm just gonna like that I'm just

gonna like get on it like Quidditch

style and just stand there okay alright

ready to leave okay and also Cass major

armor on myself

splendid it's to be safe Sam dalla your

turn has come around uh and summarize

some summarize will act on your turn

unless you if you want it to

it's summarized with me is he using the

side of my shoulder he's probably like

perched on the the furnace on on the

main deck because it's warm there

but he's like within five feet of you

I'm gonna telepathically say to

summarize I know you weren't always down

for this so I'm gonna let you make your

own decision right now and then sandala

is going to hop over the side of the

ship and cast fly on herself okay all

right and then if I have a quickened if

I use my quick into action on that can I

do another spell since that would be a

bonus action or is yeah so when you use

your quicken spell you can cast a spell

that has a casting time of one action

and it becomes a bonus action for you so

yes you can calculate out so then for my

so you all see us on the left throw

herself off the deck of the ship

and then not fall to her death but just

sort of and then she disappears oh she's

doing leave later all right cool

and summer wise will also take flight

and fly off the ship and away from the

vessel as far as his little wings can

carry him just bail on us yep

the captain has left to the ship all

right sir Godfrey just sort of watches

the captain leave and says I don't think

that's right buddy and then he says

don't wait on my account definitely not

going to

while you can and then plan waffles will

just sort of sidle up next to Strix and

kind of nudge you bodily with her face

over toward the arcane Olaf

oh great but waffles what we've talked

about going into danger

no head-butting into danger

alright and shemekka now just sort of

glides and stands over stands next to DF

and waits to hear the words and you see

her her mouth sort of curl up in a grin

we're seriously just leaving Godfrey to

try to land this boat all by himself

anyone look I see Lysander out there so

handsome I think Bandar is everywhere so

that is a very poignant point you just

made edified me and my spiritual growth

but what about sir Godfrey can lid

Godfrey could land the ship it doesn't

have to be pretty it just needs a land

from there it can be medicine child fro

through whatever means can you do that

he says if I get killed

I'll just a return in another body yes

he's got a plan right wait in another

body why don't we just kill him take his

corpse with us because then it's Luke

and it doesn't count as a person just

stop just no one is dying mine let him

take his own with us

maybe we should ask him

he's gonna be fine i polymorph him into

a bird oh oh wait that's a DF Stern on

my turn I will do that that's not a good

plan that way you could just fly away

exactly okay

so that I should wait to accept no

because I mean the Dragons getting

closer all right schibetta how long does

it take to cast a spell to teleport us

away I just imagine her taking this

moment to just make us nervous yeah like

she is an oasis of calm in this

otherwise chaotic situation it respects

us more nervous if there is such a thing

let's see she says I need only speak a

word all right well can you wait like

two seconds so we can turn God bring it

to a bird oh you like dammit alright I'm

going to delay doing anything until

Strix has a chance to help Godfrey okay

and and then I'll speak petition mask oh

yeah you can inject it you can speak at

any time so that's right alright palton

you're still hanging out to see how this

all plays out I'm going to turn to

Godfrey yes I'm going to ask would you

like to be a bird I've never been a bird

before I'm happy to try great and now

there is consent

so everything's great nice of you would

you like to attack Godfrey now I will I

will continue to hang that was alright

Godfrey will turn to you evil and say I

prefer the bird plan

[Laughter]

uh.okay

and he also says honestly I'm not quite

sure what the death curse effect will

have on my ability to assume a new form

that's good thinking

yes so if I burden him I will bird him

into an albatross okay they can fly the

longest distances and have the largest

wingspan all right he will willingly

subject himself to these spell so he

doesn't make a saving throw and let's

see how long this lasts eight hours

right that's some ridiculous long oh it

lasts up to one hour okay well you can

at least get someplace where he can find

passage to okay yes so he transforms

into an albatross big wingspan yep and

is now on the deck in his bird form

waiting for his action so he can flee

all right all right so then he's a bird

yeah which by the way I'm slowly being

consumed by sunlight at some point I'll

probably have to adjust that camera this

I get uncomfortably close a little

strong

[Laughter]

I guess we'll turn to ceresco yeah and

say it's ready good your spell book mr.

Fox's spectacles and your teleporting I

wrote this down and your teleporting

Strix evil ed palton myself Simon

waffles juniper and artist - Strix was

the name of that port city port Lions

aru port Lions ro and with that I accept

your gay is to return your items all

right then he will hold out one of her

clawed hands to take yours DF and she

will hold out her other hand toward

paltin

yeah all right and you take her hands

and then she just sort of looks around

and waits for everybody else to

basically join hands okay actually

Simon's got Paul fits other hand simon

away yeah you just put your hand on

waffles for a grabber grab a handful of

her artistry thank you and when you grab

onto his glove you feel even through the

glove his hand is extremely cold I hate

this his other hand not so much DF great

all right Shemesh cutters an arcane word

and in that instant you are all gone off

the deck of the ship

Zhan dalla all right where do you go you

see this flash on the deck of the ship

and then just about everybody's gone

except for a dorky looking albatross and

summarizes kind of flown off in the

opposite direction from you the ship is

just sort of hanging there yeah and now

his main plan here is you just disappear

from the whole situation to get as far

away as possible as quickly yeah I know

I have an hour on my invisibility in 10

minutes on fly so I'm trying to get to

the ground before I begin falling okay

which has to happen within 10 minutes

but other than that I am just okay so a

steady descent away from the ship so as

you kind of plunge downward your ship

gets sort of smaller and smaller and

smaller and you see the dragon Circle it

once and then nosedive toward

you know opps okay uh and I'm still in

the air I'm not on the ground yet that's

correct okay uh yeah you're able to I'm

gonna say like a minute passes and you

realize that the dragon is plunging down

after you okay as it basically bursts

through clouds like you're basically the

two of you are going down through clouds

and they occasionally break and then

they're in your face again you can't see

anything and then they break and then

again you can't see anything but in the

fleeting moments when you can see the

dragon bearing down on you you see that

it's claws it's it's limbs are pulled in

tight to its body to accelerate its

descent but it's got little claws on the

tips of its wings and you can see

clutched in those each of those claws is

a wand there are two wands it's got two

wands in its swing claws as it just

sails down after you and it's it is

faster than you so it is going to gain

on you I I think as long as my fly spell

isn't gonna like run out I guess you've

still got a fair amount of time I mean

you'll have no trouble getting to the

ground in the time one way or the other

[Music]

Wow I'm really at a loss here I yeah

we're gonna highlight goodness I I'll

just cast shield on myself for now

that's a that's sort of a momentary

thing you can do that as a reaction when

okay I should I should say that okay

[Music]

I would like to use mage hand then and

just just put up like just a one of

these like mage hand middle finger to

the dragon the dragon the dragon does

basically come down at you and fully

aware and it looks like it can see you

you're not sure how but it looks like I

can and then you know that dragons have

extraordinarily keen senses and the

older they get the harder they are to

fool but this one you also know that

dragons of Klaus age also have spell

casting so when he gets to within what

he considers to be speaking distance of

you which is about 90 feet away he says

wow smiling okay he can hear me okay III

yell Courtney and Zaru

and that's it all right

it was sold out yeah then he's on he

will breathe fire on you make a

dexterity sorry dexterity saving throw

which for you will be you get plus

plus zero on their whole too bad he

didn't get trapped a natural 20 yes well

done well done

I got the first one laughs all right

bear

the DC is 24 so that fails all right

great okay so a gout of flame just

absolutely covers your body now you have

do you have any in a special resistance

that's no it doesn't look like it cold

yeah too cold I could do the shield the

shield will not protect you against the

dragon's breath weapon as you can throw

the shield up and the fire just eats

through it and you are completely

completely engulfed everybody else

appears on the edge of what looks like a

scintillating Harbor the sunlight shines

down upon the water so brightly it looks

like all these sort of illuminated

crescents of light flow on the surface

of the harbor of look like this yes

exactly and you can see all of these wow

this place is great Oh

all of these ships with multicolored

sails and flags in port and lots of

activity around them cranes loading

goods onto and off of them crew singing

to one another as they go about their

daily chores further off in the distance

connected to the city is a sort of a

lighthouse a big structure made of stone

and then you can also see

all around you these beautiful marble

and sandstone structures many of them

with painted murals on their walls a

multi-tier City just sort of looming

spectacularly around you crowds you can

see

evylyn your first ever look at a what

appears to be a dinosaur a massive

elephantine creature with sort of a

stumpy looking ahead and these almost

like a hard stone shell covering it with

these spikes no no no no no we can't

afford these and it's got all the ways

it's got all of these ropes and things

attached to it and it's dragging across

the ground a wheeled cart with timber on

it and there are some people sort of

supervising and trying to guide this

creature I'm telling you we don't have

money like a few crowds of people are

aware of your sudden appearance even if

they didn't see the flash of your

appearance they do see you now and some

of them just wave and others just kind

of look at you some of them have like

become flasks or gourds that they're

drinking out of and they just sort of

hold a gourd up

but generally speaking everybody here

seems pretty nonplussed I see people

with flashy I'm just saying guys

wandering off to m7 two women and a guy

who all have these flasks and they will

share with you this rich super-sweet

alcoholic honey drink and they will they

will give you one of those to guzzle

down they'll offer one to Simon tune

just holds up a hand and shakes it then

good boy I just shake it yeah I see I

remember that we went to what conga Oh

Tom OU's place that's up on one of the

higher hills

um there's the state as you're looking

around in short of getting your bearings

you can actually kind of see the domed

roof tops of his estate up over the

walls and over the rooftops of other

lower structures and you do remember

this sort of way to get from the harbor

up to the stair kappa stair case to that

tier or level but it's a little walking

distance off around that time to kids

blow past you strix one of them is a

small girl with a kite and the kite is

about 40 feet up in the air and sort of

wavering back and forth behind her the

girl seems to have a great deal of

trouble just keeping it up and the boy

who might be her brother there's a

family resemblance there has already

sort of gone a have gotten a little too

far ahead of her to help know and so she

sort of you almost sort of walk in the

Lion almost comes right up to your face

though she need help

I mean I'll grab it I don't want her to

get like like 20 way and I just like

mage hand up just like a kite yeah you

can you can you can use your mage hand

to sort of help guide the kite and she

says something to you which you assume

as a thank you in her native chaltén

language be careful I guess I mean

there's dinosaurs everywhere here I

don't know how you're not dead and then

when her brother sees you he sort of

panics that she's talking to you and

kind of grabs her by the scruff and

pulls her away kind of no I'm used to

that yeah do you let go of the you lay

your mage hand let go of the guide at

that point I'll just bring it down a bit

so that it doesn't keep dragging her

along so it's you know I'd rather have

the kite fail then drag the kid into the

air all right I feel like that Thanks

you know I'm I'm a little scary I might

smell bad but you know it's fine pull my

hat down it's just over my face this

place is a weird Easter Mass go with us

she

and at this point in time she turns

around and takes her finger and presses

it up to da head and says hey Dodge she

leans in and she seems to be preparing

to cast that other spell she said she

would cast on you the one that you said

you would allow to be cast I also even

was reminded as she sees paltin walking

away to go get a drink that like his

flesh was falling off and I can't

remember and I can't remember so you

didn't so much as fix that as DF gave

paltin his ring which basically stopped

the decay oh yes yes you have you have a

you have a scroll if I rolled up scroll

and a vial of ink that Jessica gave you

that you need to summon the sonne

sisters I thought it was that we needed

to a sorry for interrupting no that's

all right I'm glad you reminded me I'm

assuming that Strix is has that just

just took it from end it's like this hey

this is your business but I'm like well

now Shemesh go doesn't actually have to

touch you to cast the gayest spell so as

you just sort of see just is yeah

exactly she just wants to touch you but

as you pull away she cast the spell

anyway and you can feel the magic upon

you and you can try to resist or you can

forego your save yeah don't feel scary

yeah I made a deal and I'm going to

honor the deal because the last thing I

want to do is make her mad mm-hmm

all right all right shut resists okay so

suddenly a compulsion washes over you

and you believe that you must with due

diligence pursue her quest to retrieve

those spectacles and the spell book

which is called

I should tell you this if you don't

already know so you don't you know

hander any old spell book it is called X

the mystics arcane grimoire X spelled

capital X X the mystics arcane or

durable yep and the spectacles are in

the custody of a creature named mr. Fox

alright and then she says has done the

key alright she takes that you have five

left and the arcane gate materializes

behind her she just sort of backs up

into it and at this point in time palton

the group that you're with they're just

sort of a gog at this magical spectacle

of this fox headed woman disappearing

through a scintillating doorway and then

it closes and she's gone have fun at

your party

uh can I just like a look at the crowd

feel like don't summon Devils it's bad

don't do that one of the one of the

people in the crowd looks at you and

says in Shelton dinosaur Rider I

understand line yeah that's right I won

you want what I won the dinosaur race

okay no strikes like suddenly gets

guilty and goes I didn't win Jim

technically was on the dinosaur longer

than me but I did help him win because

he was falling apart you know how to

race dinosaurs

I don't know how no no no we're not

doing that there's a made Chandani

mountain

what am i a real hand is on Paulson's

mouth not racing any dinosaurs we're

looking for the arcane grimoire that our

artists will say I think the party's

clearly divided on this issue

maybe we should secure accommodations I

agree artists we also have to summon

some hag so that we stop dying yeah that

sounds like a great idea I sense that

sorry Holly roll percentile dice if you

were oh okay that's it all right 94 94

so the guy that you were talking to who

is suddenly infatuated with you because

he saw you race a dinosaur and win a

trophy hands you a trinket and it is a

mosaic tile

it's a tile with a multicolored glazed

surface it looks like it was either you

know taken from something like a piece

of a larger mural or or somewhat because

it doesn't look like it's a complete

thing oh and so he just hands you that

mosaic tile and he's like it's one of

those situations where he didn't expect

to meet somebody famous and so he's out

fishing around his belongings for

something that he would consider to be a

token of his affection and that's what

he came up with that's so sweet

can I reach in and just give him like a

half-eaten pastry yeah sure he looks at

it it's just sort of disgusted and also

thank you let's see guys I told you very

famous that's right evylyn I'm famous

I'm totally famous that's great maybe we

can use that to help us get to whoever

it is we need to be oh my gosh I'm

totally gonna be your brand manager we

are gonna make the best dinosaur racing

team with you at the head I just see it

now

I don't remember you're a brand manager

for Bolton what I remember that yeah

I'm a great brand manager Paulson's

doing he hasn't played a show in a while

but like as she says that like a piece

of my flesh falls off well like I got a

present from a random person so things

can't possibly go worse okay you

everybody looks up at the sky and just

sort of looks around to see what's gonna

fall on them all right Marcus are you

can recommend a local establishment

where you can find you know just good

place to sleep and rest and not be

disturbed but he asks you do you prefer

to be kind of in a quiet place or in a

loud raucous place why I mean raucous do

you mean fun and party quiet basically

the tourism the two places he recommends

are the thundering lizard which is a

tavern slash in which is very very

raucous and it's close to a market so

it's loud now on there is kaya's house

of repose which is where you can get

actually a good night's sleep in a quiet

part a quieter part of the city sounds

great

first one to so we have two artists

where do you want to go he says if

you're gonna perform this ritual and

summon these creatures of Hades I would

recommend a less crowded quieter place

all right three against two quietly

gonna be our sleeps already gonna be

interrupted tonight the last thing we

need is more interruptions on top of

that okay but then soon we got to go to

the more raucous one and Paulson's got

to play yeah yeah emphasis on the rock

yes some some sailors kind of walk by

and they give you nods

they kind of shun strix maybe it's just

the smell I don't know but

famous dinosaur racer you and you can

see that one of them is a very dark skin

the other was more like a tan skin

foreigner and they look at the owl bear

and they're just sort of dumbstruck and

one of them says for sale no and flips

is gets his coin pouch out no sorry no

no not for sale killing machine are

killing machine He pours out like he

pours out a pile of gold in his hand and

just sort of holds out for sailing now

related can I tell that from what he's

holding his hand is his currency the

same as what we now or similar it is a

different mintage from a different okay

but the same kind of coin yes okay

that's good do we have money again I

don't understand you say when you say no

no he just sort of furrows his brow and

disappointment hey what about whole

dollars here the man out Paulding nature

and all his mouth alright there's no

more girl they on Paulson's mouth or on

the guy's mouth

Paul don't smell my my my hand tries to

like him that actually doesn't really

like you can just sort of easily move

away from it so you can kind of talk

it's not that effective at blocking

sound it's more of a symbolic gesture I

think yeah yeah yeah so this guy this

guy wants to buy family this guy wants

to buy your albear he's offering fifty

gold pieces which he seems more than

fair at least for the first offer and

the other one is saying how but it will

taste cut up into steaks which I'm sure

she's done before yeah I'm like just

ride waffles okay I'm pretty sure she's

done that yeah yeah no my I mean our

Howell bear all right as you're sort of

right

it off they sort of give it a wide berth

when they realize oh it's your horse

there you go

great my horse I like turn to him it's

also like really tough experience evils

riding on waffles to wit's tricks all

right yes you talking the whole time no

let's go enter waffles in the dinosaur

race before before we leave this this

fine fellow with all the gold yeah I'm

just gonna I'm gonna offer up a little a

little tune for him in exchange for a

charitable donation oh okay by me

absolutely make a performance check sure

you're not there yeah you're slowly

riding away we were we weren't away

though just look here's dude dude dude

you just fly off of waffles it's like

that'd be in 19 excellent so not only do

you get them you know slapping their

knees and clapping their hands but

actually you get about like 30 people in

the vicinity who picked up on the sound

and kind of closing around you because

they rarely get to hear these kinds of

dulcet tones and on such an instrument

such as this you're playing your

mandolin it's that right yeah okay yeah

so you play and they are truly truly

well entranced can Simon be walking

around with a hat yeah absolutely

he'll walk around with the hat and

people will just start throwing

miscellaneous coins in yeah they're yeah

those coins just tumbled in tumblin you

can see Simon the weight of the hat

starts to sort of bear down on Simon a

little bit as he goes around

evylyn you're I'm walking around being

like oh that's Paulding set by have you

heard it he's the greatest

oh yeah check him out on

there were such a things now you have to

basically get up to reference some sort

of in or tavern where he's known to be

I'm just talking about how famous he is

he's like one of the world's most

desired musicians and I'm just like

going around doing PR for him basically

this lady's a robot yeah it's like he's

got a couple of robots one who's working

the crowd and the other is collecting

the coin oh my god so it's it's quite

it's quite a little thing they got going

here in fact it's such an attraction all

of a sudden that people are intrigued

about how long Paul tins tour is and how

long he's staying in Port lions are ooh

and we're worthy be performing and will

he be doing any special events yes not

dying that would be a special event for

him you even ask someone like where

where is the premier concert venue here

oh gosh that's a good question so make a

either an intelligence investigation

check to get that information out of the

crowd or if you prefer you can make a

persuasion check okay because I have a

+9 to persuasion very good so seventeen

all right well there are a couple good

options if you're if you're truly

something like they will book the grand

Colosseum for you normally that's where

they have gladiatorial games and big

sort of carnivals and huge events but if

they can pack it with a performance

they'll do that if you want something

more sort of surrounded by the the

locals in the crowd and you're just sort

of you know the grand sook also has

musicians and performers and you can

usually do very well there but if you're

also very good the merchant Prince's

will often pay large sums of money for a

private

performance and there are seven merchant

princes in the city they start telling

people that you know he has a few

private gigs booked with some urgent

Prince's first but like I'm pretty sure

he's gonna be playing the grand

Colosseum so just like keep your eyes

out I'm pretty sure I heard that all

right I just imagine that like Strix

India they're just standing by a waffle

just like eyeing her she's she's so

optimistic that she's like I'm just

positive that he's just gonna be playing

in that grand Colosseum real soon just

like keep your eye out yep

this is not lying this is like pure evil

and optimism death is more standing

earth is steady there with his arms

folded just thinking out loud to himself

Strix is famous Alton's rocking it as a

dinosaur was trundling the past they're

allowed it's great people handed your

drinks the other thing you learn evylyn

is that good money can also be made if a

bard is not interested in really crowds

a bard who performs that the public

bathhouse can often make a decent amount

of coin it is a place where people go

who are if they're scrupulous about

hygiene to get a bath and it sort of

operated much like a private club there

are attendants and people to wait on you

will need there it's very sort of gala

tarry and an elegant everybody from

wealthy merchants to dock laborers can

rub elbows in its tiled baths and marble

floored changing rooms and it's attended

by servants of the temple of soon which

is the local temple to the goddess of

beauty I said when he said it's about

hygiene it just like the camera pans are

different and you just hear fly noises

this all just stood up for the

inevitable bathhouse episode finally the

baton I also I'm saying that like asking

people if they know that likes tricks

the famous dinosaur racer also hangs out

with falton and like it

that cool and maybe they'll do some sort

of joint show sometime yeah yeah

and also I try to find out it's like

who's the manager of the grand Colosseum

like who's the Booker you know oh I see

what you're saying

so nobody on the street knows who

actually books that who handles that

kind of arrangement but they say that

one of the merchant Prince's Akemi Hoffa

is one of the city's greatest gladiators

she retired made a fortune and is now

one of the ruling elite in the city so

maybe she knows well of course you'd

have to get an audience with her okay

and I'm just kind of like dancing and

partying and like yep working the crowd

DF as Strix is on what waffles back and

evil ins a lot losing herself in the

crowd talking to folks and paulten is

playing up a storm a robed man young

maybe in his 20's comes stumbling

through the crowd and throws himself at

your feet and looks up at you and with

the something about the way he looks at

you suggests that maybe he's drunk

or out of it or just not entirely there

but I've seen this before

my hands immediately go over my puppies

yep all right

instant defensive maneuver yeah yeah

yeah so you're starting to all of a

sudden your senses or looking around for

all kinds of trouble this is some sort

of distraction and he says speak to the

wise Guardian along East she can direct

you to that what you seek then he passes

out

face in the sand nobody seems to care by

the way the hell stirs obviously here's

to going well looks down and be like did

you kill that works that way he's lying

spread-eagle on face first on the ground

[Laughter]

you can clearly see death he's still

breathing okay is there anything you

don't you don't smell alcohol is it be

particular about his robes because they

look clerical when you kind of kind of

have very cautiously still looking out

for pickpockets and whatnot you kind of

kind of roll him off so his face isn't

just flattened to the sand you can see

that on the front of he's got under his

robe a chain around his neck and as you

just sort of roll him aside you can sort

of pull the chain out to see there's a

pendant with an eye like a lidded eye

staring back at you it seems to be a

holy symbol of some kind okay can i

religion check it I'm gonna say strict

you're too far away to see it in any

detail I'll a lie DF to make a religion

check that's intelligence DF great

religion all just good intelligence the

substitute for your religion

all right or lack of another one so is

that the first waffle crew one of the

campaign called it yeah you so don't

recognize the symbol in fact you're not

even sure now it's a holy symbol well

I'm not gonna I'm not got take it or

anything he does he doesn't look like a

priest or acolyte he's probably too

young to be a priest but he's definitely

like an altar boy or something all right

what was it what did he tell me again

you tell me to seek thee wise guardian

or as

at Orellana all right the rest of other

words that I can't remember so with that

all I kind of go back to Strix

Strix you've been here before have you

heard of or illunga I think I did you

did yeah look yes really yeah yeah when

you were in what makanga Oh Tom lose

library and you were a un VRE we're

fishing through books the word or

illunga came up as a lost city of child

that's right there's a there's an entity

they're seen as an Oracle an all-knowing

Oracle there's an Oracle there and I'll

tell D at that and also mention how neat

the library was yeah this raises several

concerns so you know what exactly is in

or a lungo or what is an Oracle yes so

there they probably know where I'm

guessing the spectacles in the spell

book are considering that's we know

where the soul bogger is there in omou

somewhere it doesn't that seem more

pressing than well no because you now

have keys on you so that is the most

pressing thing if we don't fix that we

can't stop anything we call the hags

maybe then we'll be okay but that's

probably going to be incredibly

traumatic

yeah is there longer like on the way to

Oh move I don't like any you're not sure

about two birds one stone

it could be but you don't know you don't

know yes I'm not child to geography and

this gonna tell d.c think about going to

the soul monger right now and see what

happens think about I'm gonna go to the

soul monger instead of going to get

these spectacles just think about it uh

okay I sure could go for a soul monger

right now all right so death is you try

to focus your thoughts on that quest you

feel sort of a psychic burn

in your mind like if you were to pursue

that path to the exclusion of the other

your you might fry your brain Astrix why

would you do this to me how's this for

me two points it's important we have to

fix your problem first we have to get

the spectacles in the spellbook so I'm

guessing that that's where this will

lead us but you know let's call some

hags it sounds more like someone's

baiting us in that's your decision to

figure it out just like the unconscious

man right Paul turned a sneaky one Simon

comes up to you with his hat and you can

see that there's a mix of copper silver

and gold coins in it you'd have to do an

accounting but just just looking in the

Hat with your eyeballs you think there's

a generous generous sum they're more

than enough to pay for months of drinks

as a matter of fact I do do you work on

percentage yep cool we'll talk more

later okay Simon we'll just keep the Hat

closed not let anybody look inside it

but you good boy hmm all right so you

guys gonna make your way off to kaya's

house or propose yes please

okay I'm also after meeting up with the

others I'm going to relay the

information of going into this area over

a lunga etc etc yep

excellent all right you get some

directions and then you saunter off some

of you riding on the back of your

ginormous albear which attracts more

than its fair share of attention but

people give you a wide berth I wave to

them every time they look at us yep and

you do that you get a lot of waves back

you think that even though port and ions

are ooh is a huge affair li decent-sized

city it's very very remote and

the people here

despite that seem to be well accustomed

to strange sights you can you feel the

warmth by the way not you evylyn but

everyone else can feel the humidity and

warmth of this place this is like Hawaii

weather and then in fact as you're

making your way along through the

streets the clouds start to come

overhead blotting up the Sun and then it

just starts to absolutely rip roar rain

for about five minutes and you'll find

yourself like many people moving toward

the buildings under these cloth awnings

that stick out at the highest floors to

basically deflect and catch the water

and as the rain just pours down and

pores pores pores pores pores you can

hear it just slosh down these sails

along aqueducts and down into barrels

and reservoirs and fountains where it's

all collected for drinking and after

about five minutes the deluge stops the

clouds break apart the Sun returns and

it's like it never happened

like we're like ten times smellier now

sort of this wet walking mop she

wouldn't shake once somebody's riding on

her but if you were to get off her yeah

she was yes I like to imagine that you

hop author and he's like signal for her

to shake and Strix is still on her and

was like yeah why it was like thrown and

a few stray gray feathers go flying as

she shakes and yeah so now she's this

damp sticky wet bear creature no go

prestidigitation her dry oh sure

she's dry now she's sort of poofy again

[Laughter]

all right and you begin to make your way

through crowds of people and they again

part in front of you and then sort of

fill in behind you until the artist

leads you all the way now on your way

there I'd like everybody to make a

perception check to see if you notice

anything 15:13 you're drunk and dying

all right

drunk and dying so strict you ruled the

highest right with your natural you got

a twenty Hey

okay all of you can see what appears to

be a drunk

foreign sailor by the way he's dressed

picking a fight with three local

commoners who are kind of older and more

frail and clearly no match for the lout

but that's that's about 30 feet away off

in a corner of this crowded street but

Strix

you also notice did you do a one of the

figures in the crowds is a light-skinned

man which stands out here very very

light-skinned almost Scandinavian in

complexion and hair color he was

chatting with what appeared to be a

couple local merchants not buying

anything or selling anything just having

a conversation with them and laughing

but as you walk by his attention is

drawn to you and stays on you involved

he seems to be taking his measure of you

and after you walk by he begins to

follow you oh we will he's trying you

can tell by the way he's following you

he's trying not to be in

or confrontational he's just fine where

you're headed um straight still just

like Evelyn's on waffles so she's just

gonna like casually turned to evil it'll

just feel like there's a dude following

us oh my gosh is probably a bandit

doesn't look like a fan he's well

dressed he looks like somebody of

importance he's not like a scruffy alley

dweller or anything like that

she also could like pass it on okay

like passed on to offals waffle no no

not to waffle no yeah oh yeah you can

see this man has sort of a satchel that

he has over his shoulder with with stuff

looped to it to scroll tubes and other

things and he's got a water canteen off

his hip so he looks well provisioned and

does he look nice he looks nice yes I

think he looks nice tricks why don't we

say hi no one is nice I think Hey hi

there oh she start to wave at him he's

he's somewhat kind of ashamed for a

moment for an instant like okay and then

like he didn't want to attract attention

but apparently he did and he waves back

at you and it will cut through the crowd

now that he's been identified and make

his way over to you and he says well

Matt well Matt indeed no need to sneak

what's your name are you following us

cutter he says well you do attract

attention I'm sorry I didn't mean to

disturb you or get in your way I was

just struck by the strangeness of your

company and the beast that you travel

with she's real party isn't she and you

are some sort of animated being I mean

my friends have called me animated

he says I'm - hland how lyric what what

kind of sense do I get from him like do

I find him charismatic you do you think

that he is cultivated to be a

conversationalist

and a sort of an outspoken friendly sort

and he says you strike me as adventurers

of some kind or another would I be off

in that regard no no and in fact you

probably were drawn to us because we're

traveling in the company of some famous

people this is stretch the famous dawdle

race no stop bouncing cepa's right there

and he's on his drunk and dying to her

right now

[Laughter]

the drunken dinosaur is a thing now so

just a minute ago but you know we're

working on more stops all right well he

says well I don't follow the dinosaur

racing too much but I always appreciate

a great performance he says and if you

are looking for work you can find me at

the thundering lizard oh you give work

to adventures I do have some work

available if you're interested what kind

of work he says Scheldt is sort of a

mystery in lens

quite far away from here but its

resources are just waiting to be

plundered and one of the hardest things

to procure anywhere is a good map and if

you were willing to provide an accurate

map to some of Schultz

shall we say more promising locations I

would grant you access to a sailing ship

as I represent wealthy water Davian

interests really

water Davian you say indeed well where

are you from I'm glad you asked and he

says I am of house - land of water deep

you know go to that banquet back back in

you know to celebrate that thing you

saying may I ask how you came to this

place was it by ship my fox foxfox is

the name of the ship yes by Fox but not

your own but not your own ship

no no wouldn't you like to have your own

ship you know now that you mentioned it

I would love to have my own ship right

wine ship because I would rather have a

flying ship so we can be as good as the

other group that I was with no names

mentioned do you have any other flying

ships he says uh and he he seems a

little put out by that he says well the

ship I have doesn't fly

it sails well that's that's okay I mean

not everyone can be that that special I

guess yeah I guess I'm sure your ships

real guys it's real guys uh but so you

want a map of places it show that have

lots of good resources yeah and when you

say resources do you mean like natural

resources do you mean like human

resources in terms of like people who

have good information or maybe just real

fun to be around

he says I'm actually more interested in

discovering routes to some of the more

mysterious locations in Scheldt places

with lost Laura and ancient secrets

waiting to be discovered like oral manga

I would kill for a map before illunga

figuratively speaking of course

of course he said it looks likes writes

down will kill and

Nangal or have you ever heard of the

garden of delights ah no but I want to

go there right I loved him like you were

so much in common he says a map a map to

oral Unga and angle or that alone would

be would satisfy would satisfy me and my

house we'd be glad to give you a ship in

exchange for that map where this ship

come with a crew no but we can recommend

one aim the ship of course naming thing

are you gonna hang out with us till then

no um but be real nice are you sure you

don't want to hang out with us evil and

you know he'll die because if you want

to come by if you want to come by the

thundering lizard I have a room there

I'd be happy to I hear good things hmm

yeah yeah anyway I didn't mean I sorry I

didn't mean to delay you or hold you up

honestly I was just curious to know

where you were staying I was hoping to

get in touch with you at some point

maybe have a more civil conversation and

shall we say with drinks and a meal

which I'd be happy to pay for but I

don't want to hold you up so I'm gonna

let you go but you know where to find me

again lyric - hland we will see you at

the thundering wizard for sure soon as

we take care of this hole yeah yeah good

you know do what you have to go do your

thing enjoy the sights and sounds of

port and ions aru

bye sounds good I'll find John Lincoln

cool alright see you on scraps - Graham

by this point in time that drunken

sailors beat the oh ho - three

comics and let them left there lots of

them basically punched out in a corner

and it's gone Strix is just thinking

about what they're gonna name their ship

and she's like the happy Chuck but when

when you get to Caius house of repose

you realize that the door is probably

too narrow for waffles to squeeze

through comfortably she could but she's

probably better served being parked

outside

they have dinosaur sitting areas right

like for like to keep people's dinosaurs

safe tables some distance away like

across the street they have some posts

that you can basically tie things off to

okay and there is a there is a guard

actually standing out by those posts to

keep an eye on the animals all right I'm

gonna can I ask Paulson for some money

to give it to the guard to keep woful

safe oh this is how it's gonna be

Strix will hold out the other half of

the have even eaten pastry and then go I

could have killed Simon 50 years nice

so yeah if you give me money as I hold

my hands out like a small child with no

money

sure how much do you want to part with I

take out a single coin off the top

alright there you go don't spend it all

in one place sends you a silver piece

how much money it will still run over

and tie off waffles and give it to me

for the guard with the pastry and like

the guard just sort of lets the base you

fall on the ground but he'll take the

silver piece and just not hopefully

waffles is just gonna try and grab the

pastry next to his feet yeah waffles

will probably do that yeah all right all

right all right when you go in you're

able to secure rooms that's no big deal

halten can fork over for that too and

then you can basically pay by the night

so it's not that much and once you get

your rooms you see there's a downstairs

area where you can where there are

couches and chairs and you can sit in

and there are servants who stand in

corners with big sort of palm leaf fan

and just sort of wave them at you while

you're sitting down oh this place is

real nice yep when you go upstairs your

rooms are small but there's like a vase

of water on a table with a basin a

wooden basin that you can pour the water

into there's a window looking out onto

the street or the alley your door has a

lock on it there's a thin bed but it's

sort of hand-painted handcrafted and the

walls have big colorful murals on them

and in some cases niches carved into

them with candles and other

accoutrements arranged in them this is

what we needed just a nice relaxing

vacation and nice place to invite the

hags over and even just simply by chance

it looks like you've got a room that has

a big mural that shows this big sunrise

coming up over the mountains with some

birds and things in the foreground

toucans

parents yeah so once we get to our rooms

I'm gonna remove that file and scroll

that I got for shemekka that's supposed

to be yes ah my name is sewn sensors and

I'm going to hand their districts you

know you know magic making this Arcana

check you know magic 16 all right you

believe that these two separate things

are meant to combine that the ink is

meant to be applied to the scroll all

right and sort of writing or just dumped

on there you're not sure wait is the

scroll bike yes oh okay I think I think

you should wrap what you want and all

your hopes and dreams especially the

heel Paulson you're not in here this

probably up in Strix this room I'd

imagine nice come basically knocked on

our door and handed an attorney's things

unless you're still like looking I just

imagine evil

halten in your room Simon has basically

dumped the hat onto the bed too so you

can count up all the coins and you

managed to score a total of a hundred

and forty five gold pieces all right

damn lifestyles of the rich and famous

yeah yeah yeah a flush fan lot of money

gets thrown around in this city so these

are supposed to be used to somehow

summon these sown eggs to relieve us of

this curse would you do you know do we

get instructions on how to do that no we

got none but my guess is that we write

and/or dump the ink onto this scroll I

mean I I have a quill so I can just try

writing hello

to Beast yeah there was something you'd

like write our desires and then they'd

come by I don't think I don't think

they're gonna be helping our desires at

all I'm I don't know what's going to

happen and his Strix is saying this

she's just like dumping salt around the

room and just like things and like

drawing things on the floor like okay it

might not help but pentagram yeah she's

just covering all the bases yeah all

right and then she just like dumps the

water like around two it would just like

throw some ideas thank you

but we should get everyone in here no

you gather you gather the crew all right

you're all right you're all in Strix is

room now

I'll make sure everyone's eaten before

we do this goodbye just to be safe I

don't know yeah I had I had some bread

all right I don't need to eat when I

consist on the love and light does

anyone need to use the Privy does anyone

need to use the Privy before we start

this the Privy is down the hall at the

end of the hall I don't think that

constructs do that no okay that's strict

stakes for a second I was like no

probably not

all right even had to go in a while so I

don't think so so she'll put the scroll

in the middle of the room like on a

pentagram that she drew just for

whatever okay because and take out a

quill don't make shake it and then she

just don't look at everyone be like

whatever happens

it's probably going to be bad so prepare

yourselves some oh I'm sure it'll be

fine

uh-huh on the ground on put the incan

right oh wow question mark as soon as

you take the cap off the little vial of

English the ink basically slithers out

of the vial like a snake oh and begins

to sort of it just sort of spills down

onto the floor and then crawls across

the floor toward the sheet of parchment

back up back up back up just back up

against the wall back up as the snake as

the ink of snake hits the parchment it

just sort of leeches into the parchment

and purplish writing appears on the

scroll until all the ink is gone and now

represented as writing on the scroll are

these characters that we can read or

recognize these are this is like a spell

scroll script strikes that you could

read all right arcane characters but you

can read them I don't give it a gander

yep all right no I didn't use the Vander

evil InFocus strikes you can sort of

almost recognize the hand in which these

these runes are scribbled it kind of

looks like a Baba Yaga's hand Oh balls

that's why I say out loud as I'm reading

it all right and as you read the scroll

and you finish this scroll turns to dust

in your hand and it's gone did we do it

I don't pretty sure something happened

something happened as strix is gonna

look at me like it might be worse than

we thought I definitely recognize the

handwriting as a Baba Yaga who I might

have spent some time with at she was

still kind of like my grandma it's a

long story

not her I don't her to make donuts she's

real evil like you will you hung out

with her it's a long story I taught her

how to make pies well

it's your grandma she's not my grandma

if you hear something batter up against

the window which you probably closed

before you did all this tricks and the

windows got these basically squares of

glass set into a leaded frame and

something bangs up against it again and

then flies off like a like a bird tried

to get in in that moment even runs over

to the window hacks is it row the window

open evylyn make a perception check to

see if you can see what hit the window

14 it it appears to be a winged snake

Wang's sake a sort of a kind of a dark

colored snake with feather hey did you

did you have did you want to talk to us

hi sorry the windows closed it's gone

wha it was a winged snake thing does

anyone feel any better

never there's a knock on the door

outside and when you open it a servant

comes and it's got like a plate of

cheese and dates and other foods that

you can nibble on oh the old man who

basically delivered it he seems

accustomed having doors slammed in his

face so as you shut the door he's

already kind of turning away I don't

think we really having a party a hotel

yeah and like the hotel staff shows up

so you only open up just enough and

using your body to block everything

that's inside yeah okay yes thank you

there's only two of us in here no one

feels any better oh by the way even when

you also peered out the window and you

look down the other direction you could

see waffles are still tied up down there

kind of happy as the class seems to be

like sniffing her butt or something just

doing that cat thing where they're like

trying to clean themselves yeah all

right I leave a window open and come

back okay

can I Spence if anything has happened at

all or you can make an Archon attack

they said 24 your best guess

is that you have basically in cat in

casting this spell you have sent a

notice or a message off to the sound

sisters that they can come as they will

to you and knowing night hags they will

probably come to you in your sleep all

right all right well we're all sleeping

in Strix is room everyone get a rope and

tie each other together tying a rope got

it okay how are we supposed to follow

sleep with this hanging over and I said

and booze yes better than a sleep spell

last longer

all right also we haven't told artists

like I want I want to tell artists yeah

artists is probably in another room you

haven't invited him here no okay all

right I just telling artists that we're

all in one room and to please check on

us in the morning and make sure we're

alive when you go fine artists you see

he's not in his room but when you go

downstairs to the common room he's down

there sitting in a plush chair with

somebody waving a palm frond over him

talking talking to a female half-orc and

they're just having a conversation when

you poke come down the stairs and start

to bark at him

all right just like hey artists so we

might have summoned some night hags

they're not only gonna come in our sleep

can you just like check on the morn 2 in

the morning and make sure we're still

alive we'll all be in my room ok ok yeah

as Strix walks away or distr pne's back

to her and says I really should tell you

about them the half work is just her

eyebrows go up and her face sort of

crinkles a bit but she doesn't have any

huge reaction just ruined his chances of

getting laid

the ultimate pretty exciting and

important right I mean now strict I will

let you make a perception check to see

if you notice anything else about her

right 16 you noticed that just

fleetingly before you turned around that

she had on her what appears to be a holy

symbol that you organized as a

gauntleted fist that's the Louisville of

Torme interesting so a God of strength

and battle I will note that for later

considering that we always need people

that are good at strength in battle hmm

let's we are lacking yeah and it's very

clear looking at her that she's as out

of she's as out of place here in Port

lions ro as you are half works aren't

really a thing down here as far as you

can tell all right well I'm hoping the

artist might be hiring hurt or something

like that I'm guessing it looked like

that they were having some kind of

conversation like that but you go back

up and you tie yourself to your friends

and by this time the the Sun is just

starting to set so there's this kind of

awkward period where you're not

particularly tired you're tied up and

having this sort of waffle from oranges

evylyn just tries to like lay her head

and strix his lap and just like talk

about her feelings yep and dfu don't

feel particularly well because you're

without your ring now and right the

death curse is sort of taking hold so

you kind of feel a chill set upon you is

palton our policy are you passing around

the booze and we like oh can we at least

get drunk yep okay yep

you all get evil and you can drink but

it's not gonna have much effect on you

every time it gets passed to you Lindsay

kind of like looks at it and kind of

like looks around and kind of like pours

some drops into her mouth and it's like

[Music]

[Laughter]

yeah juniper is like drunk and passes

out just sort of water is down into her

compartment and then juniper just laps

it up all right having a good time all

right when you all fall asleep and night

is finally upon you you're very

unaccustomed to the sounds outside port

nines hours street noise continues

through the night but you do with the

aid of the alcohol fall away one by one

and what happens in the night is this

each of you feels something climbing on

top of you huh that's like a third thing

for Bowman and as you as you sort of

you're not sure whether you're awake or

not but when you open your eyes you can

see a somewhat spectral almost ghostly

figure of a old crone with dark skin and

horns curling up out of the tangled nest

that is her hair very thin and spindly

is basically just writing you like she's

having a sexual encounter with you she's

sort of in the throes of that and then

this spittle comes leaking out of her

mouth and she sort of grabs you by the

mouth to open your mouth and her spit

just blop

okay dollop of spit just falls into your

mouth it's important like all right all

right now evylyn this doesn't happen to

you I don't dream right you do dream but

your dreams are full of sunny Lysander

dream

and you don't have any hag encounter

whatsoever well you you may have had a

sense that there was something in the

room with you that was evil and untoward

but didn't want to get close to you was

somehow repelled by you by me and

Lysander skipping through a field of

flowers that's it yeah exactly and

bunnies and other frolicking animals

befriending ya you're singing a song

with Strix in a field and she's happy

and you know and I'm a really good

singer right

yes uh-huh and Paul tunes playing on a

rock he's like sitting on a rock and

playing beautiful yeah all that business

is there - yep just there I'm like he's

like up in a tree just shaking his head

yeah or he's on a swing probably yeah

seeing how high you go he's smiling and

enjoying everybody else is having

dollops of hag spit pour it into there

all right right and then after the spit

kind of lands in your mouth and sinks

into your down your throat the three of

you not evylyn awake so distressed by

that yeah and you can taste that fell

liquid substance as it courses down into

your body we all just woke up you all

three of you woke up at the same time no

there's no hag on you nothing bad did

you guys have a dream or anything yes

cool me neither

all right strict wake up like anyone

else feel awesome strips you know this

is gonna happen two more times

oh yeah do I know what it's doing to us

nope great great no well actually a

great tone yeah you you have any make an

inside check I'll let you do that

all right to see if you have an idea of

what it might be this is so bad twelve

hmm you're not quite sure yeah I thought

so it's better to not know what's

happening really I don't wake up I'm

still asleep unless they wake you don't

wake her up

and it's the wee hours of the morning at

this point it's still dark out you can

hear waffles outside Krista do I feel

any different if I just you know general

it

you will be one hit point down off your

maximum as another day passes so you

feel you feel achy more icky more weak

well Strix is it Strix is gonna

definitely take off her ring and be like

we need to switch these out and hand it

to Diaz we have to switch it every day

you can't just take this on your own

look but where the curse is over will

will be back to normal right what who

knows but we have to die slowly so we

need to share these rings so take mine

you're right until tomorrow I'll take

right ring yep and after about 10

minutes of wearing it you're able to

attune to it and suddenly you feel that

decay that sort of that weakening abate

good all right I'll lay down go back to

sleep okay upset alright you're able to

basically fall asleep again undisturbed

by hags complete your long rest and when

you wake up in the morning you go

downstairs you see there is a huge

buffet arranged in the ground floor of

Caius House of repose and you don't see

artists or the half work there in fact

you're probably one of the first guests

to come down and actually partake Strix

will just start stuffing things in a row

it's all very sweet and nourishing and

there's sort of a big basin like

fountain in the middle

that's currently just sort of full of

what looks like it smells like a rich

sweet punch but paltin you've come to

know it as a sort of a very sweet honey

alcoholic drink in the morning yeah all

day every day yeah this is Paul tins

dream town diesel started like you know

getting up breakfasts and got played for

two little sit down to eat but as he's

doing that he's doing I think was just

like this like no eye contact don't talk

to me please just it's trying to eat

everyone's just babbling about like

isn't it interesting how much time

people spend eating I remember it must

have been nice to eat I think it was we

sure do spend a long time eating are you

guys done yet also I had a real nice

dream last night oh you did too was it

like a field of flowers we were all

there together you can describe it as

that no evylyn we had a dream where a

hag tried to no no touch us and then

spit in our mouth and that's just life

now so maybe you shouldn't eat before

you go to bed it gives you nightmares

you see artists come in through the

front door like he's been out in the

town already and he's got kind of a

distracted look on his face when he

first walks in the door but when he sees

you he sort of lightens up a bit and

asks you how your night went realizes it

didn't go so well for all of you and

says well that's too bad and he says if

it's no trouble I was thinking we could

travel in the company of a priest that I

met yesterday she can provide some extra

healing that we might be lacking and she

needs to head downriver to a place

called camp vengeance

[Music]

he says I'm not interested in that kind

of thing

I'm sorry camp vengeance yes it is a

fort that is held by the order of the

gauntlet

it is a nightly order that has dedicated

itself to helping to protect the city by

purging the undead that run rampant

through the jungle that's great I have

an important question how would heading

towards camp vengeance further our goal

of say getting to or illunga or OBO he

says well firstly I secured some canoes

in case we want to travel up the rivers

oceans star which will take us all the

way to camp vengeance and get us fairly

deep into the chalten wilderness I think

it might be faster than traveling

Overland is this the direction tourists

or illunga yes do I believe them make an

inside check if you do believe him

and you think he may be withholding some

information but he did not lie okay I

really like the idea of traveling by

canoe I mean even Lenin's tricks you

guys can just kind of fly alongside us

right yes okay so I could also polymorph

you into a bird should things go awry

then Wilbert escaped but until then

travel by canoe sounds preferable yes he

says under ill has received reports that

another order encampment camp righteous

was destroyed we'll pass that on the way

to camp vengeance destroyed by what

according to the reports she received by

undead oh I don't like undead I don't

like them one bit

the jungle is full of them well good

thing the light of Lysander's on our

side and we can send them forward into

the light of their new dawn and rid this

world of them when will you be ready to

leave I'm good now I had a great night's

sleep I'm just super refreshed and mere

hours until then want to collect up any

additional supplies we could use for

this journey rations and the like just

give us a little bit you say wait till

those hags show up weren't we supposed

to know just don't worry about it I've

procured some other supplies as well

rain catchers other paraphernalia meat

umbrellas any kind of like poison

resistance maybe holy water I don't know

things to get rid of the undead I mean

we can buy some antitoxin if you want

yes that would be good no Sam I can do

yeah scared there are some things I

wouldn't mind going to town just

purchasing for myself mundane things I

assure you

yeah if I could just have a moment to do

that then I'll be ready to go related we

have no money this is we're just why are

we so bad I mean what are you gonna do

for it everything in my power to restore

you and keep you alive right answer

that's pretty good I won't need much

just maybe 10 gold tops I'll return the

rest alright buddy I mean you did put a

ring on it last time so I mean doesn't

leave you that much okay thank you all

right I'd like everybody to make

perception checks

16:18 five I got a five - no way yeah

whoa twins DF yeah you're the only one

to notice a flying snake dart away which

is okay you can see that the snake waits

for artists to go to walk past and climb

the stairs to his room and in response

to that basically it was hiding and it

looked like a potted plant it

immediately flies up and darts toward

the door as if it's following him as if

it's seeing him and is now going off to

somewhere oh boy okay but he's going a

different direction bang artists yes all

right so after like kind of getting the

coins from palton I was no homicide

whisper whisper talk loudly nut said

allies can hear just we're being watched

I mean it is the price of fame not like

that do I recognize the direction that

this it's flying inside that's all yeah

okay I'm gonna quick run outside see if

I can spot in the air

just to give you a general sense of what

direction is going yeah way in the town

further in the town yeah it seems to be

going further to another part of the

town so it's basically flying down a

street okay

and as you run out and track it you

don't have to make another perception

check

to see that the waffles is fine you

don't see that you don't see that guard

around and the snake kind of stops flies

in the air kind of looks back in your

direction and then darts down an alley

zhong dalla you you're as you're in as

you are engulfed in flames and you're

burning incinerated body falls out of

the air you see the great dragon klaus

veer away from you and fly south okay

and that's where I will stop what does

that mean yes all right

she took 91 points of fire damage but I

want to thank Thank You Dani you got in
