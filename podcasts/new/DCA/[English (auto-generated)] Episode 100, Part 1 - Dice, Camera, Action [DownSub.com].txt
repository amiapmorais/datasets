hello I am Tycho Brahe hey a penny

arcade and pax I am also a minify

Harewood run see you of acquisitions

incorporated but today I'm Jared k

camps and I am running the very first

episode of waffles incorporated it's my

great pleasure to invite super super

cool new guests into the studio to my

right the bard who goes hard it's Pauly

SEPA punset everybody hey to the right

of my right repping the natural world

walnut dog grass craw craw for friends

new and old coke rock to my left

representing the grandeur of its evylyn

it ceiling no to the left of my left

Dragonborn narcissist dinar Blitzen

[Music]

just a bit of new business just to

establish some basic terms you can 100%

just as in ordinary c-team games and for

new people something to consider any

bits that go toward a player give them

charges to charges can be expended for

special techniques you may know again

friends new and old forest friends is

what walnut dawn grass can manifest tons

and tons of mundane creatures typically

these creatures do not survive I was

there

dinar blitz in as a function of his

draconic heritage and maybe even

something else he doesn't even know yet

has the ability to commandeer the brain

stem of opponents and dominates him boy

I got to yeah oh no because what I'm

deed he also has the wrath of VARs

malice which allows him to create an AoE

blade attack

but in concert with one chris perkins

who you will see very soon on this very

stream

there are also powers for members of the

waffle crew coming in you stand a chance

at all with me get this is like when you

go to dad's house yeah right can always

come from your house exactly ice cream

for dinner stovetop stuffing every night

every night so paul me you have a very

unique ability that we don't even we

don't have anything like it in our

regular game okay you have the ability

as paltin it's relatively

straightforward you speak directly to

chris often in this game you can break

the fourth wall so to speak with two

charges you can ask me direct questions

and I will answer them okay evylyn you

can become the son so that's a pretty

good power yeah you can become the senso

think about all the ways you might want

to use that photosynthesis barbecues

mitochondria ourselves I'm gonna come

after your cornea it's gonna be bad easy

accidental oh yes oh you're already

you're already like well no not the

actual size of the Sun you become the

baby horrible imagine imagine you know

how you got like the full Sun it's like

but that's inconvenient that travel Sun

right that's the kind of situation you

can represent bodily the might love and

energy of Lysander and it casts a lot of

kinds of light and radiant damage in an

area around you so a little mini mini

nuclear bomb now so it should be said

that just before the events of this game

there is some correspondence sent I

understand tell me if I'm wrong that the

waffle crew has new digs mm-hmm in water

deep which is all

we're the official acquisitions

incorporated headquarters is a letter

arrives via the post

yes fixes hat indeed even snatches it

it's like imagine a situation where like

right now no feel free to share it with

the class imagine it's happening like in

a Civil War documentary it's got my

dearest well is there an omen read it

then absolutely maybe you have made an

excellent case you guys are in the new

place and it's like it's like maybe it's

raining outside it's like you're like

reading it but like through the window

okay there we go

and the voiceover paladin mal thing

excuse the formality of my introduction

but I am making a formal request and I

would have the gods which govern such

things as penmanship and proper speech

aid my entreaty I would like to invite

you to the N I grew up in still governed

by my mother and to introduce you to a

few of my trusted competes good food

warm beds enjoyed in the safety of a

small town bring a friend if you like

there's always room to spare I will join

you if I am able but for now let me

steal the troubles of your world for a

while a minify Hereward run now and so

feel the way that you feel about this

simultaneously a letter is delivered via

al b @ v drawn and career so your your

missive is slightly different and i

think it should be read by a document

sir it's on acquisitions incorporated

official letterhead to walnut on grass

document sir ranked second from ohd mmm

walnut I require your discretion in a

matter of utmost importance I have

invited a paladin of Lysander named

Evelyn Marth into the drownin courtier

I have sent Rosie beasting or South with

Catherine's because I have every faith

they will interrupt my romantic campaign

in some way no no before you before you

read the last line pause it's vitally

important yes okay

it's true I am

smitten with her imagine being a flower

who can derive all aspects of its

nourishment from a benevolent Sun and

this is how I felt in her presence it's

vitally important that during her visit

she derives an overall positive

impression of both myself and the

overall brand of acquisitions

incorporated she will meet my mother she

will eat a cornerstone though they

slightly out of season she will come to

know the all-caps affection and

camaraderie which are so deeply

ingrained in the body of AI such that

her curiosity will be kindled and then

we may be together forever I'm aware

that you are in a tender place at the

moment

and I sympathize but under no

circumstances are you to fall in love

with eat evil in Avalonia hell bake my

fame

all right now can I keep the letter oh

yeah person know there's yours so you

this having occurred what are the next

steps you would take in this context

well even has the letter and I imagine

Strix at least has to be there and

usually the waffle crew kind of hangs

around this bar that just happens to be

in the center of their house so I

imagine they're all just hanging out at

the bar and eat ones doing the like

little like heart bubble thing emojis

are involved oh is like popping off

of her head

did you sometimes and she's kind of just

like reading it over and over and she

says I think we just got invited to a

party sick it's with omen you remember

Oh me

like I remember that why wait do I like

that guy I think I like that guy that I

didn't like that guy I mean oh hey I

think we left on a night not liking okay

Pass Wow

I mean he did say there were drinks oh

well why aren't we why are we home I

mean I think let's go it sounds great

things happen fast things change to

Barry

things were promised I mean I don't see

necessarily specifically drinks said

honestly but I just feel like they're

imply absolutely it's like you need to

find the drinks in this in the absence X

in this faces between words the drink

that I mentioned between senses digest

yeah it's like about the drinks you're

not drinking turning this airways you

try to find the drinks who talks like

this put down roots in this neighborhood

then we should start trying to make an

effort to actually meet our neighbors

okay well when we get there I'm gonna

tell them that you said that they

promised drinks and therefore something

may be always possible so all right

sounds good it's a plan i I see no

reason not to go at this point I he said

bring a friend do you think I can bring

three friends

should I write back is it like a

plus-one situation do you think I don't

know how these things work

I don't know just tell me sounds like a

risk for a wristband I just tell me if

you can get me in or not you know I mean

sounds like I can bring a plus-one but

you don't really want to go I mean Strix

will probably go no-go I mean okay no

it's it seems more convenient to the

plot if I go so I do is this the fourth

wall breaking I've heard about yeah

perhaps perhaps all right it's a simple

matter to secure passage the town he's

referring to here red larch is north a

couple days on the long road that

extends north out and then goes to other

you know towns of varying sizes but red

larches

is right in the middle it's a it's a

archetype of the small town and yeah

doing that even didn't tell paulten how

long it takes to get oh no let's go

often thinks it's just like a few houses

down it takes two days oh I feel like I

feel like he would wreck it how does

paltin how does Paulding invest himself

in this multi-day journey

oh my gosh what what do we do is this

going like well well beyond when it

should stop it continues to go over

there it's just complaining you have to

sleep twice you said we're going to a

party really quick this is not a party

to fun time really the moments were

blessed with here in the line of the

morning Lord

if I'd known I would have brought my

chair I don't have had it walk me you

know I can do I have a walking check

that I have things right sure it reminds

me of strata it's a little bit

disturbing but I'm glad you like it

I'm glad I like it too no it's a

literally every part of this journey is

an author and taking nightmare okay

there is an old woman who you have not

seen wake up once sort of seated inside

the cart alternately snoring and farting

like back and forth okay just undulated

with these natural processes great yeah

I mean like I said I mean it's bait it's

like it's like Ravenloft in that in that

it is a place of constant terror good an

agitation yeah great

very natural I think at this point just

like constant like misery and sadness

just like yep

and that seems about right par for the

course you're calibrated for this level

of torment yep all right now walnut as

you as you arrive at the final letter in

fact it can read the last line of the

letter one more time and I will use that

to set this next part but under no

circumstances are you to fall in love

with evil and avalonia hell bigmar thing

all right as you read the last word of

this mm-hmm

the door swings open and in the hollow

place we're inside the frame of the door

an upper planar creature

seems to materialize music is heard hmm

light is shed there's a tiny plant who

even your druidic capacity has been

unable to assist unable to nourish but

for some reason prophetess drawn is not

able to doesn't have the heart to get

rid of it

mm-hmm begins to peak its little head up

a little bit sort of seeking in the air

for this source of nourishment I feel my

heartbeat in my throat yeah it's like

yeah I'm just I'm taking a I'm taking

her back I lost track in this moment so

you can see here the personage Ullman

might have been referring to in the

letter behind the bar is a tall stocky

elven woman with a very very short

cropped sort of platinum blonde hair

doing the sort of classic maintenance

one always sees proprietors engaging in

and as though taking note of your

Raymond she gives you a quick nod and

says soldier hi are you monotron she

says who's asking oh excuse me I'm even

Evelyn Helbig mouthing I guess evylyn

yeah she is

I mean it's like if she thought that she

could slide over the bar in the manner

look at dukes of hazzard sort of like

hood jump she would definitely have done

it thinks better of it comes around the

side and for some reason this woman

tends her in dressed like dressed for

war cool so this is two soldiers in full

Raymond like hundreds of pounds of

soldier and get like in a full embrace

even like hey

she she seems very quickly like a person

she is unlike omen mm-hmm she seems like

someone who does not who doesn't know

where to put a compliment why she

receives the compliment and then has to

immediately put it down somewhere and so

you can see in her mind she's trying to

find a place in her personality to

accept this information well then you

get to do two big Pat's on the back and

that seems to be that seems to be the

the the final word on that even then as

soon as like you know she's made this

sunny entrance like ha she's like and

here's my friend Ponton it's kind of

just on the side and there's he's

standing right so what what music do we

hear obviously not literally but

remember we're fourth wall breakers what

what is the soundtrack that accompanies

Paul goo as he passes this threshold

into the drawn-in courtier I more

imagine like whatever music was playing

like as Paulding was like hiding behind

evil and she's like and this is Paulding

it just kind of like stops it is like no

record scratch I thought about record

scratch it seemed too abrupt it was just

like you can hear just like a couple

cranks and just like a stretch of a fork

yeah hey that's our the the moment like

the the bubble bursts the moment sort of

disintegrates in there so let me tell

you the sort of archetypical small town

in you have entered into large luxurious

window to the right you've entered into

the door the bars on the left you can

see a small kitchen curving around the

back wall the the tables themselves in

here are arranged without any particular

strategy plenty of sturdy wood that is

currently supporting what seems to be a

local spot over to the right there is a

small stove furnace right above it as a

painting of three children to the left

of that as a tiny stage that can that

one can certainly avail themselves of

just past that as a stairway that goes

up to a second level and you can see the

doors that go to individual rooms up

there would you say it's a stylish place

no you think that this place you think

that this is right in the middle of it

seems hardened like it expects to be it

expects an incursion at any time it just

seems like a very solid safe stable

place

the only real adornment is the single

picture she seems to endure over by the

stove minimalist like so on trend right

now I've just said I've been trying to

decorate our new place over in Waterdeep

and I you know I'm not quite I'm more of

a you know bright like boho chic kind of

thing going on but I don't know anyway

she says walnut were we expecting guests

I yes I heard word from from omen that

we were to be expecting evil intent and

guests that's me she she furrows her

brow says he could have written me also

didn't okay that's fine I'm sure he had

a very good reason he always does is

there anything else in this letter that

I should know

well not that he would like her to

sample a corner stone she says

it's a little after last stones day but

I do have a little extra batter I don't

want to be in this Venus if you weren't

expecting anyone we don't have to she

says she says no you won't be an

inconvenience you're going to help me

make them Oh what are you okay all right

she she slaps the top of the bar a

couple times and then sits on and then

and the chief justic is you over to the

wide stove and you see a you see a

variety of novel implements in this

space a very very strange almost like a

imagine a very shallow like a banana

bread pan very very shallow only about

this big and you can see that she has a

bunch of they almost look like crochet

needles maybe a long metallic she pours

the batter into these small spaces and

then as it begins to toast up you can

see here like grabbing it with the pin

and then folding it over and sort of

scooching it around and tell there is a

tiny rectangular cake that she she pokes

grabs out and then put some some jelly

inside and then she sits she stands back

and folds her arms and then gestures

with her head to you to the depiction

idea in her mind she sees the raiment

and she's like all right we're we're

gonna cook just like we would on the

front type situation so she she is

gesturing with her head toward you and

then at this at this dough as though I

should get to it even tries to imitate

what she did maybe I should roll over oh

no there's gonna be rolling here okay

yeah yeah absolutely let's get that

performance roll okay actually oh no -

well that's gonna be too funny

all right so you see the batter and you

look over her and then she looks at the

batter and looks at the pan and you look

at the pan and then look at her and she

she puts her furrowed brow and very

focused trying to imagine a universe

where you're gonna come out of this she

knows that this is possible and this is

no it's just like and then it's like

it's like a radical reinterpretation of

ghosts at a certain point she's

adjusting she's adjusting the elbow the

dough goes in and then at one point the

pointy piece goes in and it comes out

and then it goes out over the edge and

then part of it falls into the fire we

can't all be a cook I'm more of a

decorator she's like well maybe we can

maybe we can set something up here maybe

we can set something up so she sort of

creates a station that extends down the

bar with different jams and then she

begins to place finished ones in front

of you to jam oh I can do that okay just

stuff with Jim I can do that

and in a few minutes Denar you smell

down in the kitchen proper a an

incredible indeed unseasonally

uncredible incredible feast of treats is

my presumption is at this time as at

many other times dinner blitzen Gennari

prince is asleep yeah most likely so

that that would that would rouse him who

else is in the end other than our new

guests is there any is there just are

you empty couple locals a couple like

right now is the place that after last

stones day that place is emptied out

substantially imagine OMA has been

trying not to wake dinar

oh yeah she is flabbergasted that he was

not also summoned away by omen I know

right

and then I was wondering like would she

want to like tell him or just be like is

it worse to tell him I don't know we'll

find out we'll find out I didn't know

yes I guess he would come out like like

Cheers you know like norm and there

audience applauds yeah that's what diana

is a room but like it doesn't happen but

it happens in his head it's always like

waving to no one as he's walking down

the steps and then in very like looney

tunes fashion led by his nose would just

go like right back in the kitchen

giftgiving yeah yeah it couldn't be fair

that Denard does not remember even

because you're a signed picture of

himself like he wouldn't yeah she's like

oh my gosh you remember me we totally

met each other that one time and you

find my thing and like we had that

really meaningful interaction Joe if you

brought the the cornerstones are you

like the our new cook I'm holdin our

SideReel cons you just went just one

minute makeup Joe are these our esteemed

guests of omen himself

I need listen I need you to listen up

for once in your life I need you to

listen to me and I need that know right

here right here big guy all right

I know I got a shiny I need that yum yum

Hut level of host that's what I need you

to bring I need you to give me Big Daddy

dinner today all right

yes only you can do this only I can do

this you're right you're right you're

right

all right you are I am right it's all

right this is killing her like inside so

I know she would be hating this yes

right you can do it you're so right and

great love you big guy he just turns

around and goes Evelyn

[Laughter]

it takes time

Paulding yes tell me more

this is a situation you had acceded

there was an expectation of beverages

mm-hmm

there is a small stage in this context

right he was very very very small town

mm-hmm and you get to decide how you

feel about that mm-hmm

he will he'd like to inquire about the

beverage situation so you you you you

sidle up you can see on the plates or

these tiny fried cakes full of jam

lightly dusted of course with sugar okay

okay but that's not what you're after

it's like yeah is there like a like an

open bar situation like what's what's

going on with that I was uh as an

esteemed guest I was promised a certain

weird a drink looks over at you walnut

like you are is this your responsibility

are you managing this place I I like a

look at the ground like what am I

supposed to do in this situation and

then I immediately think company right

off absolutely on the C teams tab its

sounds like a good tab pretty folk' I

mean I'll find a place on the tab for it

well this is all right this is I mean

oh man we'll take care of this Oh

understood we know he's good for exactly

so you can see just out of the corner of

your eye where the kitchen proceeds back

around the back wall you can see a

couple barrels stacked their corks at

the ready and you'd have every reason to

believe that they are flow of what you

want mm-hmm

she gives you a cup and then gestures at

the barrels it's just like really glad

we came today you know this is this was

a good vision

yeah and so you're looking at the the

stack it's basically like three barrels

in a frame and then it's like you're

back there and it's like a it's almost

like a like a romantic connotation it's

like you're here in this place of

intimacy with fully three barrels and

then you see that she's still there in

the in the corner of your eye you can

see that she's still there and she's

like what color do you like ooh ooh

decisions all decisions are tough what

what do you recommend she says well I'll

show you what I like okay she goes and

gets in much larger cut okay and always

good and puts basically a third of a cup

from each you shush basically a third of

a cup from each of these different

barrels which is quite a process

okay um but you can see that down and

down at the bottom down closest to the

earth there is a black almost syrupy

beer ooh that takes its time coming out

of the tap okay smells like coffee toast

and then as we get up it gets lighter

but never light it's like that the the

lightest she has is like a rich red

color at the top well there's just like

giddy watching for us he's just like

she's like I don't know I don't know

what they have you drinking down in

water deep and then but she she passed

the barrel like a beloved family pet

mm-hmm and she says you might want to

take your time with these and then she

she leaves the

so honey how do you want to put this

stuff together I think I will know I

guess as closely as I can mimic get the

third third yeah yeah absolutely it's

like at first you're not even sure if

they're mixing in the cup like it's like

a peanut Buster parfait but you're able

to you're able to pull something out and

it's essentially like it's essentially

like an energizing alcoholic coffee ooh

it's this is this small if this is this

small town living like it might be okay

you you see so tell me tell me tell me

about your bardic practice like how much

performing does palton do um well

usually the performing is to acquire

said free drinks so with this situation

at hand he thinks like well I don't

think I'll be playing today you see

maybe like maybe like you raise the

glass to the empty stage it's like I

don't know type situation all right

dinar is it is time to activate like

host duties how many uh how many

cornerstones are in a pan of course

don't pan itself can do four at a time

then rz3 and he's going for the force

she's like he wouldn't and it's like in

his hand smacks his hand away yes

waiting mat for evylyn yeah mr.

president yeah one of those being

jumping all right and uh yeah well we'll

start trying to put the gym in it and

get it all going and then pass to people

and be like okay this is this is the

famous cornerstones that one was talking

about I'm so excited

she's like delicately takes a bite now

it is this is a product that will endure

thoughtful consumption ravenous eating

also perfectly acceptable but delicate

dusted fresh fruit jam inside

what kind of fruit well there are three

jams let me see which one we had so the

local flavor here is blackberry

strawberry or black currant and my guess

is that black currant is probably the

least in our flavor in the mix that's my

guess one that would not use strawberry

yeah yeah okay so there is a single

black currant sweetened black currant so

she takes a bite and she's like mama

drawn this is just it's just lie and you

know it just it tastes like you know a

summer night sitting with someone that

you you just trust and care about and

that little black currant burst it's

just and she just goes on and on and on

about how this case you know as long as

someone will let her talk absolutely

metaphors you know just this the cup

that she is drying has been dry for a

long time by the end of this like it's

begun to abrade it's lost its last

substantial physical strength by the end

of this and she says my name is profit

so nice to meet you progress mmm and and

not Mahmud Ron oh my apologies

oh oh none yeah it's fine profits good

profits from now on profit she she

disappears back into the reverse or the

the empty space behind the back wall in

the kitchen extension walnut on grass

yes so you this you don't know how this

is going you're not you're not sure now

you're not sure how you're not sure how

well you're doing yeah okay there have

been some there have been some

oversights and you know that omen is

incredibly weird and it would be

difficult to know even what exactly he

wants regardless of what he's written so

can I take this time to really reflect

to reflect ya know to give an update

oh sure so I open up my document see

rank - ledger to a page in it that

previously Omen have been like test

writing a letter to evil in it and it

had come through into her ledger she saw

him doing that yes so this is her theory

she uses to contact him and so but this

this page is basically it's starting to

look like a like a yearbook page yeah

it's just got all these weird things

written and I'm just trying to find

space to communicate on it now so she

says um mother husband met cornerstone

has been consumed progress seems good

question mark and he writes a good

question mark she's right back excellent

will continue

absolutely so as your so you're at your

seeded I assume in the Grand room here

in the front grand of course he's

nervous too said oh really

yeah just she did all this writings like

up oh yeah in her hand

yeah like this isn't awkward I like

stoic okay can even like footer over to

say while you're writing that dinar was

gonna try to make small talk because he

still doesn't understand what's going on

yeah so like so like a mouthful of

cornerstone still like falling out of

his mouth like shreds like just shrapnel

and then sugar snout yeah crumbs coming

out while he talks just like yeah you

have a lil you have something on your

okay there she wakes it up confusing

knows no no one's touch of the CT that's

true it is head just say yeah like how

do you like it and you would look to see

a proposed on his like

it's my place how do you like it how do

you like it you're like whispers it is

like so when when omen said it was like

governed by his mother it's like you

hired her something to cross the room

just like this is while you're writing

it's going great

things are going well like you guys you

should be proud okay

that's so nice of you to give her a job

and everything it is nice yeah for a

long time a year or so yeah

ish seems like she does a good job she

is an adequate employee they all are I

love all of the people who are for me

and then gesture to walk the last time I

saw her she made that bat pie for

Strings that was fine yeah she did that

she do that

that's our walnut can I make my way back

to the they're in the kitchen right well

this this throng is sort of out in the

front room krogger self-assertive back

around the kitchen but you're welcome to

go anywhere you want okay I just want to

like make my way back to evil and just

be like all right I'm just walking like

this yeah yeah only person I know at the

party it's very smelly exactly do I I

don't I don't recognize him do I I don't

I don't know I don't think I don't

believe that Pullum knows unless you

were paying attention at the Christmas

gift exchange which palton could not

have absolutely and we were all around a

fire yeah absolutely someone was not

very very intoxicated visitors think

back to that memory and there's just a

hole where dinar would learn I think

evylyn he would beg the dinar would

vaguely remember but yeah he's sooo

self-absorbed a panty detection

he's gonna like walk up he looks at he

was like are you security here I've been

trying to think like if we can get like

because we're guests here I just want in

case you didn't know do it I just want

to make sure we got like bag checks

going on at the door it can't be too

safe you know all right all right

I appreciate you big doggie like flips

in the gold you Pat's him on the show

he's like good people work in here this

is good I'm sorry you're the owner yeah

you're the owner

yeah from the kitchen here you're the

owner

hey my god that's a great party he holds

up his strings like this is a yep this

is a what you have in that glasses of

medicine that could elevate any party

scenario in it it creates it condenses

party out of thin air it's very very

good walnut on grass I'm ready you can

see out front of the window you can see

someone like putting their hands on the

glass like this mm-hmm like trying to

get rid of the glare and look in okay

I'm gonna go check out that unsavory

creature just walk up to the window so I

see that there's commotion over there

and then I seen her run away I'm vaguely

nervous about that but he's exited the

situation so how much more damage could

there be he knocks something over his

tail all the way out think that like a

bunch of pans fall overhead all right

well I'm gonna go investigate the person

at the door or at the window

absolutely um visit they're holding

themselves like this hands up against

the glass yeah and you just walk right

up yeah I walk right up and I do this up

the glass to see who it is salute it

[Music]

this is fun

you the the closer you get like the

silhouette

you're not sure you've seen Armour like

this oh and you see prava set a glass

down very gently on the bar and then she

moves around the bar mm-hmm and she puts

her hand on her Maul

oh and she picks it up mm-hm and she

comes around the bar mm-hm and she says

walnut get away from the window

I back up immediately and put my hand on

for another okay like great parties out

of the kitchen into the main common area

and then she comes out and grabs them

all and she doesn't she you're not

registering in her oh yeah in your

picture and her face you've seen it one

other time and that's when that's when

there was a Dragonborn envoy right from

Scala in her bar basically claiming it

for a northern nation yeah she was

pretty bummed about that yeah and this

is this is a very still this is a very

still Placid face which on prophets face

doesn't communicate calm it communicates

readiness okay and so this person is

looking in and then as he sees a prophet

come around with the hammer you can see

you can see him smile and it's just a

mouthful of black teeth and gold the

door swings open and someone in this

very similar garb enters this is a

reddish tinged metal the pauldrons not

the pulp ease the pauldrons

reach out wide over the shoulder and

they have these raised sharp almost like

shark fin ridges from the center

tall and then the farther out they go

they begin to shorten okay everything

about everything about the presentation

like this is not national you you don't

recognize you don't recognize these

silhouettes at all and as he comes in he

takes profit small directly in the chest

and falls back out the door and then

profesh Utz the door and then reaches

into a pouch and gets out what looks

like a small glass nail okay about yay

big and she places this nail inside the

door frame so that pounding it through

well can it will go through the wood of

the door and into the frame itself she's

trying to nail it in yeah and when she

puts it there in one hand she has her

two-handed Maul and she says holy time

Laura eying it's me first Lance profit

is drawn clang we haven't spoken in a

while she gets another glass nail out

and then starts to work farther down and

she says do you remember how I brought

you a victory at the klephts clang

another nail mirror how I brought you

victory at the dark hollow clang every

evil hole you sent me to I brought you

victory yeah and then she looks out the

glass window she gets another nail and

then nails it over the top and then as

the hammer connects with it

you can see almost like a veil or

shimmer come down over the window and

then from the window to the wall to the

wall so there is a Miss hi yeah yeah

yeah oh yeah it's very hot we're not

gonna say how I'm not on this show this

would like to try and cast crown of

madness on one that's very good

mm-hmm so I want to try and get it to

get him to attack one of one of the

other guys out there so that is a man

it's not on the sheet it is some kind of

save he rolled what's your spell see

15:13 he makes it regardless of what it

would be the role is oaken licious okay

cool good try though

great um you just like alright you see

him out there you see him out there he

you can see the that crown begin to

materialize piece by piece and he shakes

his head and it just splinters away it's

like cool noted great I just like down

the rest of my brain it's like okay warm

up warm up around guys just get ready

pass this one of them you can you can

see the the three of them

out there sort of trying to prepare

their sort of assessing the window

itself you can see them retrieving

scrolls and preparing to breach in some

way and then through the crack like

screwing and scuttling up out of the

crack underneath the door you can see

like one of them has entered the drawing

career and then profit looks down and

says damn you jim dark magic

what mm-hmm the door the door it's not

right if what I'm gonna take my action

absolutely yeah yeah he's gonna take it

listen basically he's gonna come in you

are ready with four mother mm-hmm and he

basically just joins you in battle

instantly okay great but you rush at

each other ready to fight yeah I get it

okay

I'm gonna just hit him with flavor yeah

it was nothing

Lee yeah and uh nice and that's it and I

say something what do I say you have to

say something yeah yeah you got to try

to secure this somehow say back fiend he

says clueless you don't know from the

fiends and the seventeen they see oh my

then use his his tanking ability which

is what does the name on it varies for

you or a protection be he know

the other one the other one sure so like

a Buddha doll like a mannequin like

right where it the the force hits you

and buckles you but doesn't hurt you and

then he just goes sprawling like on the

other side of the room just like up

against a wall it's like that screams me

so much joy tab over here

evylyn I think so you have brought into

this tiny town you have brought an inter

planar police force down into this tiny

in somehow

she looks very crestfallen and she

apologizes to props I'm so sorry we

didn't mean to and then she misses that

bother this is why we never get invited

to parties anymore don't blame me for

this I was having a great time she looks

at walnut don't worry we'll take care of

our mess my apologies and then she

flutters right in front of this mercy

killer that has come in the door indeed

um and you see her like she usually is

just kind of flitting around but she

actually plants her feet for this and

stares directly at him and cast command

and says in like a like I got one of

those booming voice she says leave mmm

that's amazing

what's your spell fav defeat it is I

believe just gentle checking seventeen

womp-womp-womp

no no it's legit it's like a shadow

council gathered waffle Sam another

massive box of fries stuff going out to

you oh well the second pack is different

Elderwood main hex chest damn I want one

vibrates a little bit with the force of

it and he and he says he says you're

gonna have to get up earlier in the

morning for

sort of thing to work love dinner blitz

in so there's only the one inside so far

that we're all kind of fighting right

now yes yeah he seems to be up to the

task so far yeah all right I was gonna

use command to I guess they still yeah

command twins yeah so seems like a real

Chatty Cathy here oh yes

so I'm gonna man know and I'm gonna

command I'm gonna say monologue I want

him to sit there and just Yammer for and

waste a whole turn and I'm all all just

beat up beat him up I love this song

turd Durer right let's see let's see if

I can give people more great present

mine is also my DC is like 14 no that's

not that's not working he can't he's not

able to withstand it it starts out it

starts out with the same cruel smile

that's a mouthful of change yeah and

black teeth and then it just starts to

come out it just starts to all of his

malevolent intentions just they just get

established you know he's like it's only

a matter of time until he breaks through

that window we're we're the Red Death

would we we have Scrolls that will crack

that entire thing open and then my

friends get in here we're gonna cut you

up a little pieces you don't have to be

alive for us to get what we know we're

gonna take them we're gonna take you

guys just because we want to and then

we're gonna find the witch and we're

gonna bring you all in pieces back to

civil that's what's up that's what's

happening there's nothing you can do to

stop it

walnut unrest I am sick of his baloney

already fixed and so first name yeah I

point at him and cast Moonbeam silver

Buick pale light shines down a five-foot

radius and I'm gonna cast it at a higher

you can give him some give him some room

that's a high it's a hot cold light yeah

it's a beam yeah um and I'm gonna do 3d

10 goodness oh but he does a

constitution saving throw and you know

my spell save DC is 15 so try it how do

you do why

Wow well then he takes all just opens

his mouth it eats the moon seven so

she's 18

you know what one end yeah 18 Josh yeah

it fail maybe I just roll it up around

over the plenty and what do you think

well you're 25 30 30 no 30

listen Baker's moonbeam is 30 damage

you're not Pat Rothfuss is telling you

what they say on the Internet it's true

a baker's moonbeam 30 damage I love it

I lent it so much all right so this

there is this now this column of silver

swimming light that has even in the

middle of the afternoon entered it looks

like it looks like he's performing it

away and the monologue continues even

right in the middle of this is line he

has he has a lot to say many and then he

starts to with you know not without a

certain amount of poetry describe the

heat that is also cold and cruel inside

the middle of the beam I love to sing

that song I want to hear it absolutely

like pause mm-hmm Showtime all right

so after after that failed crown just

like all right cool this looks like a

job for somebody else a turn say of them

just like I got you fam and I'm gonna

cast Bartek inspiration nice so I like

I'm just like hey check it I'm gonna

take out my little cheap three string

mandolin start playing a little ditty

just a little just a little like you

know freeform like some just like kind

of feeling the vibe out nothing too

structured just like a couple sweet

little licks here and there I'm flying

in like kicking her little feet half oh

yeah and so that'll give you an extra D

[Music]

1004 it says ability track attack role

or saving throw oh no

a bus oh you just get to apply it mm-hmm

I just added attend to what what you

whatever you need ability check save or

attack yeah it's pretty it's pretty dope

Isaac mm-hmm yeah it's birds are cool

that's not a nicest thing you've ever

given to thank you it's like I'm gonna

go hide now okay I'm scared

oh god plenty there is plenty of dense

elven wood here in this ancient

furniture that may provide it is also of

course tastefully appointed rooms

upstairs mmm

he's gonna die by it rolls-royce Terr

he's gonna dive behind the bar nice he's

like all right I guess while I'm here

right two more two more floor about

there their dimensions sort of warping

as they are ejected from this crack

beneath the door and they immediately

spread out with an effort to seize and

destroy foes um so the first one has

been hit now and so he he feels

confident that he can he can cease

talking but maybe he'll just maybe he'll

just continue talking was just for a

treat now and now he's warmed up right

he tries to deliver another quick stab

under the leather plate and fails his

two allies one goes after evalin and one

goes after dinar so the even strike this

is there's no way this is getting

through to a paladin the next one is a

one oh my gosh it's this time where I'll

be praised I fall right oh yeah speaking

of speaking of Tamura prophet has a very

strict policy and it's enunciated in a

sign she can reserves the right to

refuse service and so she refuses

service to one of them right now okay

no she she the mall comes down are the

one that tried to attack you walnut and

then it strikes the floor and she

immediately lifts the hammer up and like

scoots her scoots her left boot like

over it to try to try to scuff it out

she feels a little agitated you think

you feel like like the main thing she

wants to get out of this like obviously

there's an interplay or incursion but

she definitely does not want to destroy

the bar next up we have even even saw

walnut do Moonbeam and she's like oh my

gosh and she was about to cast moon Mimi

yeah

but then she got this Bartok inspiration

oh yeah I know what it just kind of

she's like you know energy yeah and she

pulls out her flaming sword the heart of

Spinelli and she's like oh and she just

jumps into battle and goes after not the

one in the Moonbeam yeah yeah well you

wanted a piece of that now she doesn't

wanna mess with that she goes there's

one be just one on you and this one on

dinar so you have plenty of that and I

guess I have +10 to attack so DJ oh

great play d-10 right that's pretty

sweet

it's still I mean it's already an 18

with that sword so 10 hello

so yeah 23 look like doof okay that's

that's gonna it's gonna work and she's

gonna do that with did a real ship

divine smite oh yeah so you know also

yelling the latter will fade or compel

you and we get Sun and moonbeams oh yeah

happening it's like laser Zeppelin in

here 16 20 plus to d8 alright alright

dude to me 8 we get it you're very

powerful 3 plus

yeah we'll stick with that wait yeah 33

that's funny I mean that's that's quite

good

how does how does the mercy killer feel

yeah well is there not not fans in the

classic sense you dent the armor plate

over the in the pauldron over the right

shoulder like the sword just comes down

and then it bends it like into a v-shape

and then beyond this then the divine

smite golden like pneumatic like

pulverizing hammer comes down to follow

the blow and it basically crushes the

person to their knees like which is

appropriate when you see that type of

design power yes and what I'm wondering

is do I feel like I have done a

significant amount oh my gosh yes

and like what I what evylyn is asking

herself is with my second attack hey do

I need to do more or and if I hit them

again well it okay well everybody don't

forget your second attack I know that

was you Chas baby wizard yeah baby

wizard now so absolutely like you you

youth you feel like you have done his

will um but what I mean is all right

well she's just gonna go ahead and do it

she's encouraged by this but she knows

how difficult it was to kill the mercy

killer last time so she's not playing

around so she's gonna take her second

attack which is gonna be 19 and what was

that oh that's a 28 to hit so I assume

that's okay yeah yeah okay cool and so

this one she's gonna do divine smite at

second level whoa so she's like she's

feeling yeah so it's 6 11 15 plus 7 math

it's 20

to 28 31 and one more 30 or and on the

other shoulder like in the dark and like

imagine a dark knighting ceremony yes

exactly yes so the first the first

strike on the right followed up by this

divine will pushing him down the second

one comes down on the other side and is

was there a divine smite on the same it

was a second and that's that he is he is

on the ground like he hey you have it's

like it's like if you could get like a

you could perform the final rites

basically like he's done he's ready to

be buried now she whispers to may the

morning Alton's watching this legs

flattened out he's just like cheering

eyes looking abled it oh yeah he's just

like yeah waved family show right dinar

blitz in so you have seen some yeah see

savvy martial products here I know I'm

gonna be shut up like that I know looks

to the other paladin like no yeah and

he's dead oh my keys man hold her eyes

but I also had this is leaking like just

smite this one guy like a railroad spike

just like are very excited I will try to

kill my guy then I know let me show you

how to talking like charissa yeah I'm

like let me show you how can we do this

I will try to great weapon master this

so she's gonna swing big swing big and

with pretty much you have advantage all

right can I take advantage yeah all

right oh that's what it's for that's

that's that's what the that was going I

need power of the wine of the conch and

the waffle fan and it was very gonna

blame every other Diana heroes load this

place has two ones and he rolled the

lower of the talent or yeah what's that

get me

dudes that get me I don't know not much

you tried your best

I did try best and a nickel I get two

attacks thank God

so big old whiff no no and uhyou you

hear it like it just it comes down you

chop a chair in half like I taught that

cherry top to the top to the bottom

yeah and prophecies dinar I got it I got

it I got it this time

hey there we go sixteen oh that's quite

good now what can you do i connect I get

them deeply so alright so there's ten

damage there is that there's an intimate

connection all right like so it's Linda

match.com profile it's like 98% fourteen

fifteen sixteen seventeen seventeen

eighteen nineteen twenty

so that's twenty and I will smite on top

of that as well I will use a level to

smite also I can do these things that

you can also do I will do a level to the

D&D version yeah so what is it

so to d8 for every spell level so I'll

do a level two right

I know it's a the Divine tonight to DA

plus one one racer level yeah so I'll do

a 3d eight so there's 4 plus 5 is 9

yeah what was that there's an 8 so 17 17

on top of what I say 20 no 37 wait

should that work is it plus 1 for

Percival Lowell meaning if you do it at

level 1 you get +1 so I should have done

1 1 yeah but he's dead yes you know you

know take take take the W evylyn I'm

just yeah it says well this is will

denote I wrote to myself to d8 for a

level 1 at a 1 da trail out to me I only

write yeah it's new d8 for the price lot

and then one d8 for every additional

spot I only have great level 3 spells so

yeah yeah so you so you give him the old

baker's moonbeam no 30

yeah so you you you you knock him around

real good maybe breathes a sigh of

relief he says after I saw what your

companion was capable of I thought I was

in real trouble

nope I I think I think it's just a

matter of time until we're able to

window you down and bring you back in

wet chunks a lot they don't talk a lot

thank you

your Paulding from the bar just like

good job security holding it down it's

nice work it's great work so afternoon

our bullets in we come back to walnut

dumb grass I would love a save from bow

from poison from this special boy but he

does not succeed okay so um I was

watching

evylyn do her attacks and literally the

opposite yeah like right well my flushes

a deep red and then turns back to her

presidents like motivated and beam

intensifies like in the in the brackets

yes exactly 23 oh yeah he is he is

annihilated he melts like a wax candle

said amore no yes yeah right

since seven mourn you know we got

Baker's man damn biggest mundi right

right

so almost almost as though the light has

taken on a kind of physicality

he's just pushed down you can see this

the spines on the pauldrons

he's in the grass sort of like bending

yeah exactly it's gonna take a long time

getting out of there this the spines on

the pauldrons are sort of like twisting

it almost he's wearing a kind of bear

trap on his shoulders and he collapses

underneath the weight of it did I notice

me

me yeah even's totally was seeing this

it's just like wow all right now walnut

another thing happens here oh no so

obviously you found a lot of success

you've found success as well you enabled

success dinar hasn't done great I nailed

this okay I'm dating like Sun or moon

power into

hi and thanks that's cute power I can

puke on him

look he's hurt he's laying on the ground

at my feet you're talking to this and

you can you can see more outside oh no

and you can see that they have there's

like a yelping whine not a star outside

yeah exactly right so I need two things

one yeah I want you to roll a perception

you know I got that check out Decca 13

thats enough okay so they speak in a way

you can understand oh dear but there's

an odd they have an odd accent okay boss

yeah exactly

Eastern multiverse no and you have heard

it it's just it's certain it's certain

transpositions of consonants mm-hmm you

have heard it before where you think

that you've only met her a couple times

but this is how Audra Cordillera sounds

what I just understand this is that's

the first piece of information the

second piece of information is that like

belching out so before this crack

beneath the door has sort of allowed

them this incursion access into that

drawing courtier it is now like a jet of

ice-cold mist and that mist is sliding

in through the base of this and in fact

you can see a mist like an unseasonable

fog rising outside even in the street

and at one point you see one of these

soldiers the Red Death that mercy killer

like look in the window with fear and

terror he begins to pound on the window

but prophets prophesy nail maintains it

but you can you can hear the sound of

him pounding on it and then a shadow

falls on him outside the window and he

co

up from the very floorboards themselves

this mist is beginning to rise and claim

Paul Mew you have a suspicion about this

about this thing that is occurring and

the these mists are rising and they are

drawing themselves thickly around walnut

on grass no so everyone is everyone is

feeling it everyone is is like you

there's like clammy like a moisture

starting to build inside and outside the

armor plates and even in the end in this

place like prathap holds her hand to her

mouth and walnut on grass looks as

though she is adorned in a kind of misty

gray ballgown that seeks down Josh if

you would be so kind as to tip the

cauldron don't worry it's it's like it's

fine the party is Paulding you know what

this is hmm take a moment to make a

preparation communicate something to the

rest of the group the information that

is helpful to them that might be useful

to them in the place they are about to

go and will confer that as a benefit

when your game starts back up okay so

what do you say to your gathered thrown

what words of comfort do you have for

those who may have no idea about this

place

it's been real guys oh man see okay all
