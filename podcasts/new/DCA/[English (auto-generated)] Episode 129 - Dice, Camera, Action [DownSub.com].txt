hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action I'm your DM Chris and previously

the DF found a chest at the bottom of

Waterdeep Harbor and brought it back

home in the hopes of cracking it open

one of his attempts to do so resulted in

the destruction of us these tools but he

is far from forted the waffle crew took

a break from their travails and went to

the beach spent a day on the beach had a

good time only later was it pointed out

to port evylyn that she spent so much

effort making everything perfect for

everybody else that she probably didn't

get to enjoy the the Sun and the fun as

much as you know she would have liked

upon returning home there was an

invitation waiting for the waffle crew

an invitation to an upcoming auction

which the OTT waffle crew knew was

coming as fillet Rosner's intention to

auction off the stone of gold or seems

to be coming to fruition there was also

a package a long lengthy box addressed

to one audre now clearly missed

delivered to the waffle house but that

didn't stop paltin from opening it up

and finding a rug inside the rug then

attacked him smothered him and took him

to ground after paltin ran into the

glass pastry case waking or bringing the

rest of the waffle crew down upon him so

as the rest of you converge on the main

room of the waffle house you see or

either on the floor paltin wrapped in an

exotic rug and DF you ask palton to tap

his feet together if he wanted some help

and he did so let us all roll initiative

shall we

I still think it's one my favorite

mental images oh yes camera just sorry

was there already initiative between me

and the rug there is but we're gonna

roll again okay sure

you say also that because I was like

this evil and hear this and I think that

it was a no so do i yeah well it was

just down there first I'm sure he'll

first thing you'll do this afternoon

after the case shattered that was loud

enough to rouse all of you okay I got 14

for evylyn 17 17 for pollen 18 18 Vidia

I also got 18 okay the first thing and

the rug what there we go okay DF what do

you do okay so this is still like pretty

much immediately after we got back from

yeah it was it was a few minutes after

people started to settle kind of back

into the routine at the Waffle House

yeah so deaath is still very much like

in like justice swimsuit uh-huh leather

vests whatever used to wear back and

like hasn't gotten a chance to change it

back or anything so Susie CeCe's palta

needs help I'll spend his bonus action

to focus and make moon splinter up here

into his hand from wherever it was and

then go up and try to run up and be like

hold still and try to cut the rig off of

him okay you're basically attacking the

rug so go ahead and make an attack roll

all right

the rug is not hard to hit that's not

the rug I'm worried about hitting well

yeah just don't stab it all the way

through that hits okay roll your damage

against the rug okay

all right um let's see

the you tear us a slight gash in the rug

and it also you don't know whether this

is the work of the rug or paltin kind of

thrashing around a little bit but paltin

ends up taking three of that seven

points of damage the run the rug takes

four I am helping alright so some blood

comes up and stains the stains the rug

you notice after piercing it do you have

any other actions or anything you want

to do your standing now right over him

you can hear he's having trouble

breathing yeah I mean are these my

actually two attacks or they don't know

if I'll be able to like help probably

pull it off armory now that it's like

dad sees blood staining the Colton's

feet again just alright and then Strix

what were you doing when all this chaos

came down um I'm pretty sure was I

probably just went back into a kitchen

to make sure that everything was you

know everything was taken care of at the

end of the day I know the coven left a

little note saying everything was fine

but I just sort of double check yeah the

kitchen was nicely cleaned up and

everything looks to be in its proper

place and then in the next room over you

hear the crash and then yeah I'm into

the doorway and see well actually you

probably don't even see him at first

because he's behind the counter but you

hear the noise and you see DF so when I

see that I'm kind of just like alright I

just like go see him like stabbing and

the blood I'm just like okay okay this

is a bed this is a bad day and I'm going

to I don't know if this if would this

would work if I cast my spell of recall

would it take the rug as well this is

your word of recall you were to recall

yeah

because if it just takes us then I could

just easily get him out of the rug by

just teleporting him out more or less

which is my idea

I'm gonna only take us like a few feet

but right yeah and all you have to do is

be within 5 feet of him has to be a

willing creature but he's willing by

default you and creatures teleport to

your sanctuary so you think it could

work

yeah I mean it's like hostile but

alright you know really well yeah if

it's hostile it won't go but yeah it

doesn't want to go Alton's feet sticking

out so so I kind of walk up and I'm like

okay this no more hostile items in the

house we had this discussion before

after the chair fight okay and I just

took clapping teleport him to the to the

panic I believe you have to go with him

yeah everyone goes well no you can you

can minimize that you can say you end up

- okay then it'll just be me in palton

I'll be like Oh sake take care of the

rug when I leave okay so yep you clap

your hands palton and Strix disappear

the rug just sort of collapses into a

heap with nothing in it and paltin you

appear on the floor of the upstairs room

that that's being used as the kids

bedroom and all the in streep a storage

rental EP storage room and all the kids

are there they just kind of messing

around and playing in the room and

they're they're kind of exhausted

actually from there their day at the

beach and all the Sun they got so

they're kind of languishing there when

you and Strix suddenly appear in their

midst

whoops step there we go you're not in

the rock anymore her is it is it my turn

now and it is your turn now so you just

kind of like a pier on my back on the

floor just like eyes wide open just like

breathing like struggling I almost died

well from a magic rug I mean I think you

were you know it was there's a

magic rug downstairs it must be mine

okay so you can use half your movement

to stand if you want okay and the rest

of your movement to rush outside to the

spiral staircase that drops down into

the room you just left so on my turn I

wouldn't be able to actually see it and

do something to it right it would take

pretty much my oh well let's see

I mean consult the map so getting up and

then that's they have 15 feet left so if

you got up and move the rest of your

movement that would get you out into

this hallway then you'd have to open

that door so no you would not be within

sight of it okay I'm just gonna make my

way back over to it okay d/f the rug

rears up in front of you weird attempts

to make an attack on you Oh doing palton

from the next floor just like don't kill

it

plants 23 god yeah alright you must use

its powers it throws itself actually it

throws itself at you and wraps around

you the Strix have more faith that you

would be able to get out of that Wow

like to get to roll a 23 while grappled

you are restrained blinded and at the

risk of suffocating that's good to know

and of course while it's smothering you

it can't attempt to smother another

target so all right evylyn had gone up

with the kids yeah you know make sure

they were getting all settled and then

heard this crash and like Paul tonight

and so she had started going down stairs

toward what she thought was palton and

then Paulson's like laughing her coming

down the stairs as well now he's yeah he

won't pass you yeah you're still ahead

of him well I guess then you know she's

running down the stairs and then here's

paltin like don't mess with it and she's

like as you come down the stairs you can

see into the taproom that the rug has

somebody smothered and based on the feet

you see sticking

the bottom of it you think DF is now in

trapped inside quick your feet twice if

you need help anyway she runs over and

tries to just peel the rug off of him

okay in that case make a strength

athletics check that was my plan oh lo

opposed by the strength of let exchange

[Music]

you pull that rug off of DF give it a

good shake and kind of throw it to the

side and stake and the weights it's the

way it's now sort of slithering and

coiling around on the floor looks like

it it you're not sure what its gonna do

next

but it currently is not smothering

anybody and that brings us oh it doesn't

have yours and we come back to TF it's

like yeah on the floor it's just a rug

right yeah all right with a gash on it I

just want to throw my dagger into it and

I hope set it'll be enough to help pin

it to where it is okay so a hard throw

trick all right go ahead and make an

attack yeah okay thanks all right well

it does Pierce the rug so you do damage

I'd roll your damage but you don't

actually pin it to the floor okay and

surprised intros dagger very well how

much nine nine okay so the dump the rug

has even more damage now and somehow

looks even angrier and

angry rugs next up is strict Strix

you're back upstairs on the second floor

Paul toons run out of the room

Coulson's run away I just look at the

kids and I'm like don't don't don't get

smothered by anything and I just I'll

follow up Alton so I guess to the

balcony I'm not gonna get off the

balcony because now there's a rug a rug

a foot okay so you follow up Alton since

he opened a door for you you can

probably get ahead of him if you want

oh that's smart yeah I will I will look

at it you race down the stairs you've

seen your rest of your movement to get

about halfway down so you can see the

rug clearly on the floor in front of

evylyn and do keep a dagger in it I'm

just I jump I can from falling like

Paulsen please now this is not a pet it

says danger no we could use it no we

can't and then I'm just going to since

you you can't use it

there's no there's no way to use it it's

worth a shot

shop we could destroy this thing easy

but we could use it it'd be even better

no stop it it was given to us I signed

off on someone here signed off on it um

I'm gonna go ahead and just use the

sacred flame again to hit the logging on

fire all right it has to make a saving

throw yeah it's a deck saving strip

throw has to be 17 okay it's exceeded oh

 this stupid rug so yes your fire

streaks down and leaves a little burn

mark on the floor as the rug skedaddled

out of the way I'm just it's just like

it's just like a creepy worm see it is

quick and nimble and at depaul 10 it's

your turn okay can I can I get to the

rug yes okay I would like to get to the

rug and I would like to attempt to cast

suggestion okay no it's not smart it's a

rug you don't need it it was nimble what

are you gonna suggest that the rug do I

suggest that it stand down and work with

us

if it wants to keep its life all right

you cast the spell mm-hmm the the rug

kind of rears up in a way that like a

Cobra ring up out of a basket when

somebody plays music to it

almost looking somewhat entranced hmm

please and then it attacks you attacking

it role does 17 cool with that all right

you are engulfed by it way that was an

attack role it was cool I'm actually

gonna use my reaction and use cutting

words to bring down that attack role

okay so that is a d-10 so it's 17 minus

whatever this d-10 is what word could

cut a rug well apparently not much

because I rolled a 1 here oh my god yeah

all right yeah so death and evil in you

stare in amazement as the rug engulfs

palton again so right before like slats

over palton yep yep okay maybe it's

hugging maybe and so that's its turn so

evylyn roles and she's like and there

just goes to peel open this Politan

burrito as well all right make your

strength check 24 okay the rug is trying

really hard this time it's even harder

for you to try to pull it apart by you

man

and you rip it off cast it aside so the

paltin can kind of pop out

I said sit god I hope someone's watching

this so what is 1,300 people are all

right and that's

evylyn unless even one wants to move

which I assume she doesn't and death we

are back to you so we're cool if we just

joining us right please

I'm assuming you're asking everyone but

me just based off the rugs movements

there's really not a way to pin it down

or hold it down so I can't attack anyone

else like you if I try to hold down

myself it just pretty much let it like

grapple onto me instead right yeah and

it's full dimensions are about 10 feet

square so it has more though okay yeah

to to engulf you if you just stand on it

okay it's bigger than I thought all

right yeah and then I'll just instantly

reappear the day when splinter back into

the hand and try to throw it into the

ground once more all right 18 okay this

time you are successful both in wounding

it's so real damage and pinning it to

the wood floor damage is eight and it

will remain there until it can pull

itself free there and it looks quite

torn down the middle now it's very much

less able to hold its threads together

first liked it when you said it looks

quite torn I pictured it likes a moral

quandary so it immediately starts

tugging against the dagger to try to

tear itself free but for the moment at

least it is pinned to the floor and that

takes us to Strix okay I just you know I

don't understand this isn't even our

like where did this come from it came

from the mail and I

another right I wasn't your mail you

don't know what other people's mail I

mean it really does tie the room

together really ties the room together I

hate this I'm gonna polymorph the rug

okay what are you going to polymorph the

rug and she's just a baby chick all

right and it must make a wisdom safe is

that right yes sue not at strong suit I

don't think so it's a rug all right okay

it's pinned by a dagger it will be

pinned all right

so you turn it into a little baby chick

which is now pen to the floor okay just

throw up strikes you crucify this poor

baby chick could you and when this tiny

creature rides and guys it will revert

to rug form oh this is the worst thing

I've ever seen that's not a real baby

chick Oh

and so that's tricks palton you see this

little baby chick impaled on the floor

with a knife just walk over I just kind

of like give it a little like tap kick

with my foot just like oh okay

man that really could have tied the room

together oh well it'll turn back into a

rug it's dead now it lets out a little

death chirp no no that's real she's like

I have to leave she just goes off stops

it's like I didn't impale she looks over

the railing back down and she says no

it's

have this power I wanted a magic rug to

help us in our wacky antics but no you

wanted to crucify a baby chick today so

she's gone you're talking yourself well

there is still the one who did the the

daggering so evil and is just staring

where the baby chick was with like a

huge boo boo lip and watery eyes

[Music]

so it's dead

almost it's in its death throes so whose

turn is it

I've been paltin technically okay

tapping tapping it with this foot didn't

really count as an action yeah this is

like I'm not doing this thang

nah this is dumb I'm out I'm just gonna

go to my room Paul walks away this this

is someone else's problem

alright palton walks away which means

Evelyn or no sorry it's a rug turn the

rug dyes are that the the little bird

dies then turns back into a rug which is

still pinned by the dagger it will

attempt to free itself of said dagger

it tears free of the daggers but it

takes dagger damage from UDF go ahead

and roll just just roll your regular

damages if you had hit it with the

dagger okay so the chick dies but the

rug is alive correct cuz the chicken Lee

has basically one hit point Wow a

polymorph form when it drops to zero it

reverts to its it did nothing all we did

was just see a horrific display okay

after tearing free of the rug the our

sorry after tearing free of the dagger

the rug amps grace it basically rushes

good to it trundles and flops

across the floor yeah yeah and it will

just pop out through the door and and go

off into the night rug I would have

named it trundle and now we have the new

thing that will come back to haunt us in

its army trundle flops in its army an

army of other like discarded house Goods

discarded animated objects yes

regardless we don't pissed off the

neighbor I mean I guess the neighbor

doesn't wouldn't know like maybe they

ordered it on water deep Amazon and it

just came to the wrong house maybe it

was being sent to their place to

assassinate them oh yeah maybe maybe we

save their life on this one do we know

who it came from because it very much

well could be a trap doesn't it for that

person you keep the box there's no

return address on the box

there's simply the delivery address to

one odd Rennell neutral skull alley we

should we should talk to Audra and let

her know what happened in case trundle

flops is trying to find her - and if

Audra has any known enemies they should

know she's crying in her room over the

show for killing a baby chicken yep I'm

gonna go get dressed okay with that you

get dressed I guess we can all take a

moment to get out of our beach costumes

yes and as you're getting dressed the fu

see that chest in the corner that are

waiting for ya no I didn't forget about

you you're just gonna like you're not

gonna try and open it again you should

trying to open it again oh yeah

open it again so bad available time when

crisis is averted I'm sure we got sure

we got a little bit of time yeah

guess we'll go to the chest and

basically use different model tools

since the lock itself was eating his

tools jumper and alternate breech okay

it's gonna examine the hinges itself and

see if they can be disassembled to

potentially just lift the top right off

potentially with some expert thievery

you can dispense with the hinges hey

there

you want some expert treasure hunting

you got it there aren't any obvious

things like hey there's screws I can

take out right there's nothing quite so

pedestrian these hinges are remarkable

in their construction but you know

they're just hinges yeah so I would like

to yeah I guess try to do that okay it's

just I don't way to remove the hinges

itself all right go ahead and make your

dexterity check should I add like the

fuse tools or pick Locker what I guess

just steep stools not picklock yeah so

you're just you're not picking the lock

you're just using your thieves tools to

try to remove these hinges pretty good

that's a twenty nine oh

alright you are able to unattach the

hinges and thus remove the lid god I

hope it's a rug no when you pop this off

you can see that airtight seal and a

water-tight seal is broken oh as you

remove the lid shocking so the inside

appears to be perfectly dry and has

remained dry the whole time the chest

has been down there and you are

surprised to see the chest filled

literally to its brim and actually as

you remove the lid some of the contents

spill out around it and it appears to be

full of sawdust

what like when you take the lid off yes

this kind of lid shaped dome of sawdust

where the lid was literally pressing

down on the sawdust until its interior

interior shape was basically indented in

the sawdust so this thing was filled to

the lid with sawdust

it's another bomb I swear the only

reason they would put some like sawdust

and there's they're trying to keep

something fragile protected so I'll

carefully and slowly remove sawdust

yeah just what's going on in there you

sort of brush away some of the sawdust

and as you do and you get a little bit

deeper into the chest you see there is

indeed something packed in the sawdust

and it appears to be made out of

varnished clay ornately decorated like

I'm just like when is the magic item

gonna fall out of this and just kill you

did it seem like it was in a casing or

another box of sorter no it it seems to

be it seems to be a container and as you

expose more of it it is kind of large

urn like or jug like and it's got

multiple Stoppard necks one at the top

and additional Stoppard necks around its

upper hemisphere and there seems to be a

pattern just a sort of geometric design

painted under the varnish on this jug

when you get the jug out in its entirety

you see that amid the sawdust still in

the chests are a number of other items

oh okay I'm gonna take this this large

ceramic thing out first

okay so I try to rest your mood from the

chest and see if I can like gently yeah

you can set it down on its base it was

sort of in the chest on its side but now

you can set it down on its face I kinda

like take a moment to like calm examined

its exterior and like any extra scienter

stuff I can based off my cursory

knowledge if I can Glee

like a possible historical facts and

where I've missed maybe okay come from

you can make it you can make a history

check oh sure

love - that's not great well that's a

one okay only we know what I had for

breakfast yeah if this escapes you yeah

okay but among the other objects that

you find in the chest the next thing you

dig up is a whistle made of silver and

shaped like a wolf hmm I'll need to have

Strix look at this at some point and not

let Paul lose it yeah your palm just

like I feel like someone else I'll find

it Paul's putting on his nightgown while

he's saying this okay

the second item or sorry the third item

that you pull out of the sawdust is a

thin book of what appeared to be nursery

rhymes ah the unit the fourth object

that you pull out is a spyglass

beautiful wood engraved telescoping

spyglass all right the next object you

pull out is a wooden eyeball well that's

fun I like that that's weird but okay

and then the next item you pull out is a

wooden pipe with sort of a skull shaped

design at the end with some smoke skulls

and then at the very bottom you see a

hangman's noose

[Laughter]

Khanh now cut - do you miss hiding under

his bed what is everybody else doing

still crying in her room

okay Strix is crying in the room Halton

is getting ready for bed and you know

that has that weird little pang

something's going on gonna go change and

then we were gonna go warn Audra yeah I

got dressed and like ready and her full

paladin outfit she's waiting downstairs

like guys actually Paulding like walks

down to the kitchen to like just get a

night cup of tea and he's in his like

sleepwear and he sees even just dressed

her a to go he's like you wanted to do

that well yeah her life's at stake

yeah but I'm tired but I'm always tired

and lives are at stake I'll just see you

guys a little bit later no don't throw

all the responsibility on you I'll I'm

going in this though it's just like a

purple like bathroom yeah don't don't

don't don't read too much into it I just

let's go yes are you all come in yeah

it's like speed is speed walking down

the stairs like yep already we should go

[Laughter]

um I remember Strix is gonna walk down

holding the she has her staff that she's

also gonna be like holding the the RO

and the staff of power and just be like

I'm gonna I'm giving this away I don't

want this I don't need these things

no one should have these things and I

want to give them away give them away to

the to the black staff or someone who's

a wizard who can use things like this I

probably could

you cannot why doesn't anyone want me to

have anything if we can just stop by the

black staff tower on the way to tell

someone whose mail we stole that they

might be getting killed we're adding pit

stops now I just want to give I just

these are scary things and I don't think

I should have them because I can turn

things into baby chicks and watch them

die yeah that was that was pretty wild

man if you wanna make yourself a White

Russian debris while you think about

that rug then that's fine you could stay

on Brad

it was white Peruvian thank you fine

go Jeff I'll go pour myself a drink to

walking around in public okay well you

got like little fuzzy slippers on or

something like oh yeah okay yep it's

like 6:00 p.m. yeah yeah trundle outside

into the into the early hours and the

into the into the evening really the Sun

has set behind the walls of the city so

much of the city is in shadow but

there's still light in the sky Orange

off to the west and Charles call alley

is quiet most of your neighbors are

indoors you can see the lights in their

windows there are scat few people be

entering about the alley street at this

time it's not like too quiet

no no not weirdly quiet do we but it's

been it's been a fairly warm summer day

so people have been out doing their

thing and kind of there's a chill that

sort of falls over the city no we're

going like do we know who Audra is you

get out into the middle into the street

out in front of the Waffle House one of

dawns on you that you don't know where

she lives

well said she lived in trucks Callie

doesn't have her address on the on the

box it literally says Audra now Roscoe

Ali Audra so hey Audra really quick

regarding my fuzzy slippers yes

can they be like bunny slippers but

instead of bunnies on the front can they

just be too like fuzzy mr. shamble faces

yeah your little vampire slippers are

great cool I have a little vampire

slipper okay I thought you hated them

Bree embrace the fear perfect so

suddenly evylyn calls out Audra's name

loudly I suppose as loudly as she can

muster the occasional person might catch

an interest or stick their head out a

window after you do it for a few minutes

and then do you know where Ardra lives

Audra now as you wander around trolls

call Ali asking folks if they know her

the name does not garner any recognition

hmm well if we need to go see the black

stuff anyway maybe we could go ask our

Strix

I like asking the black staff things so

that we can be better friends we sure

are

I it might take a little bit longer time

but I could try to put in an official

inquiry with the city of watch just to

see if they know her exact worry about

whereabouts no look it any time you try

to put in any kind of like package miss

delivery with the government they're

just gonna put you off for like a month

or two only to get back to you and be

like oh sorry there's nothing we can do

it's like well you know I was home then

like I just I don't I don't see I don't

see officials getting anything done the

time efficiently so well maybe this

person doesn't exist at all and they

were just it was just mail delivered to

us to kill us or let me see if I can

talk to Magnus

oh also yeah maybe it was a previous

renter Oh

I mean they don't just drop off packages

at any old house like they knew to bring

it to ours specifically so they must

have a reason to do that

well maybe you can send him a letter or

something yeah hold up hold up

what if okay so the Box just said that

name on it right uh-huh

what if Audra Nell was the sender hmm I

don't know it looked pretty clearly like

deliver too right just said a name on it

maybe someone else is trying to kill us

but they were they were like yeah this

is this is me maybe they weren't trying

to kill us maybe like you they thought

this could be a useful item when it's

not ever happened well you know well

things are works in mysterious ways

all I'm saying is that this is weird

and we have a habit of just being too

trusting and trying to find these random

people that could or could not be trying

to kill us

that's all I'm saying you worry too much

that you you look down at your vampire

slippers please I'll go by myself it's

fine I just want to get these away sure

well we'll start there let's go straight

okay the black staff so dumbfounded by

anyone here saying you worried so much

[Laughter]

as you leave show skull alley you make

your way west on gelser on Street to the

high road you cross the high road and

begin sort of a zigzaggy your way down

streets of the seaboard to get to watch

staff tower

copper Street and then sell more street

and then down shield street and then

house centers Street and then whim

street and then Mandi verse Street and

then all the way to the traders way

which surrounds the Market Square which

is quiet by the time you get here it's

about 7 o'clock 7:30 and then this is so

fine we haven't seen this much of the

city on foot this is a pleasant I get a

coffee you make your way you stop at a

spot of small corner Bistro grab a

coffee and then head down I pay for it

with rocks had done this alleyway that

sort of goes up and down with stairs and

and when's its way to swords Street

which the black staff tower resides on

while we're like on our way I want to

like pull D at the side really quick

like deacon can I ask you something

really quick what what is it do you

think I worry too much with the most

earnest look yes could possibly give not

at all if anything we should always be

worrying more see that's what I was

thinking but we're just like we did

you'd think after dying several times

everyone would be like you know what

maybe that could happen again but like

I'm not I'm the paranoid one no I'm with

you I'm with you thank you

I thought it was that just that just

really just really I'm like in my own

head about it I'm freaking out me not

that we have anything to worry about

right now hahahahaha the dark ominous

and foreboding black staff tower looms

before you it's a tall blocky structure

that's so cool yep

I'm Strix we'll go up to little Raven

knocker yep like she does knock on the

door and be like friend Vajra I have

things for you and we have a question

cuz a rogue tried to kill us

we're sure it's fine though the Raven

mocker animates oh hi ha-ah and you I

don't remember you old from last time

that his head like dude where's the

black staff I want to give these

probably extremely powerful magic items

to her so that I don't have to deal with

them anymore she's away on business

right nano damn it she's in there I know

I know she's in there no sir no she's

not uh-huh but how can I help you

wait have you heard of telltale The

Raven the name we are looking for

someone named Audra now oh god now the

Audra now these she's of thee she's a

wizard do you know where she lives

someone might be trying to kill her with

a rock I don't know she lives somewhere

in water deeply imagine what no one Xena

for sometimes she's very interested in

dimensional magic I am too now

well I'm huh I that gives me a slight

panic attack so I just think that do you

have any information on where she would

be at all a street one who knows her I

don't know no I haven't seen her at some

time how long it's sometime like a

couple of days a couple weeks a couple

hundred years since last winter no she

could be dead being eaten by her cats

that's my greatest fear anyway what if

she lives in our house in another

dimension ow

oh I don't like that and I feel

like that might be the case whoa be fun

we're all know it's not fun

interdimensional roommates

we have ghost roommates don't even

paying rent I'm gonna stuff a pie in the

Ravens mouth tell the blanks and then we

miss her very much

I guess we'll just go home now

and I'll continue hiding these

incredibly scary magic items in my room

a group of wizards some sort of

authority we could talk to a Gil we just

went to it Oh black staff when she's

gone you know that there's the watchful

order of majors and protectors of which

all arcane spellcasters of Waterdeep are

technically members that's right uh yeah

we can

I mean text Reich's your strikes doesn't

count because she's a sorcerer um so I

don't know where that is I guess so

because um our patron works there right

or is it one of them well it just means

that if you're a wizard in the city

you're just part of this guild they

don't they tend to okay autonomous

otherwise okay well is there do we know

of a way to contact them LDF you know a

way to contact them citywide can get in

touch with them absolutely the city

watch me and get in touch with a number

of mages who work with the city watch to

help solve crimes and and manage other

issues so we should just go to the the

watch headquarters and have you ask them

uh sure yeah we kept any watch posts you

can go to and make inquiries to find out

what Wizards are available at any given

time yeah I mean well with everyone else

ask the watch if they know anything

let's go and until then we can just you

know enjoy our nice city walk absolutely

I just it to me that the kids were

getting ready for bed and then we just

left them at the house again yeah

they're fine they're sleeping what

that's responsible yeah I guess I'm

annoyed knows when you squat they might

just be dead no indeed

so death if you take your friends to the

watch post none of the watch officers

there know who you are

but if you have your trusty badge I mean

I swapped over twin standard garb so I

would certainly have that on me mm-hmm

you know I give you a whole thing right

walk I was like hey how's it going

des Woodrow city watch are you guys

impressed when DF pulls this like it's a

real badge and everything it did what

have we seen the badge before I don't

know we did because of the captain's hat

we've seen it that's a good question his

strict said that deaath was gonna get a

new captain's hat and then she just sees

it miss like I have to make a new one is

Alice there oh that's why she's Todd

there yeah Alice Keller Donna yeah okay

in that case now you you can find her

because you kind of know what her

schedule is yeah she's been a really

responsible and trustworthy friend

yeah and he's you can you can catch her

at one of her off-duty hangouts and have

a conversation with her and she's like

so

Audra now yeah she's she's a wizard

she's a member of the watchful Order

she's she's a little crazy I I heard a

rumor that she tried to apply to join

the arcane Brotherhood and they turned

her down and she started to become

wrapped up in some strange local magic

and some of the other wizards in the

city censured her yeah and then she kind

of disappeared we haven't seen her in a

while

do you happen to know remember where she

used to reside before her disappearance

um she stayed mostly at local inns she

didn't have a permanent residence

because she wasn't particularly well-off

but I can ask around and find out more

information about her maybe find out if

she had any regular acquaintances or if

she bought her spell components from a

comment source yeah if she's still

around here I'm starting to fear that

her life is in danger I'll tell her

about the whole rug and everything in

house address to her I will not tell her

about maybe she ordered it that's well I

could share that as a possibility two

wizards do like to use strange objects

as Guardians suits of armor and watered

Amazon just has such good shipping deals

these days yeah are we here are you

listening this whole conversation

another table over here yeah he's

dropping on the compensation districts

is just watching really intently just

like eating well she did order it why

would she have it shipped there and not

the river she currently is

nothing's off about all of this well

like I said I'll try to find out who her

contacts are and if any of the there are

only so many places where a wizard can

buy spell components in the city I think

they track her down that way it'll be

faster yeah that sounds like our best

plan of action okay

that's sounds like a good idea she's

also probably been to one or one of the

local libraries oh yeah I suppose that's

possibility too what's the nearest one

to stroll skull alley

well there's not much up in that part of

the city I'd say the best bet is to

is to visit the one near black staff

tower or let's start there I suppose

I just got slayed by chat rowdy rowdy

sniper said if you have a water damage

on prime account you can subscribe to

your favorite which stream are using

[Laughter]

okay well okay well thank you Alice I

appreciate the information if it also

clears your mind these kind of did you

know deliveries gone astray happen all

the time oh so I shouldn't think too

much about it

well you shouldn't lose any sleep over

it why would I lose any sleep over that

you know about your sleep we're at the

other table the rest of you can see that

there is some kind of connection there

kind of fire some kind of fire its

tricks doesn't see it stress she just

knows she's upset like magistracies like

you feel that it's like it's like

radiating over to this table when

Pompton under sir she's got a bunch of

other people in the room just suddenly

look she looks at them because they're

super bread fun fun trivia did you know

that you don't have to yell yes I don't

are we leaving yet well while we're

while we're in conversation can I ask

you something yes why do you want to get

rid of this stuff well it's scary it's

from a wizard I'm not a wizard

but it's magic right I mean I guess I

haven't even really looked at it I just

know it's scary why is it scary you know

what paltin I don't know why is anything

scary everything

to me I just live in a constant state of

fear I'm scared of that guard the deaath

is talking to and I don't even know why

well maybe it's not as scary as you

think and could actually help maybe this

is a cool thing to have spend more time

with fine I will look at the stuff right

now and on our kana check it see if I

can see what it is are you gonna start

with the cloak or the staff the robe

rose yes the staff I got a twenty one

I've been looking at it do you think you

might have to kind of a tune to it ah

alright I will pick up the staff and

just to prove a point in the middle of

the end just stand there holding the

staff and say okay palton is this what

you wanted and attune to it alright so

about five minutes later you do have any

standing to the staff and this staff of

the Magi you discover gives you a +2

bonus to attack and damage rules made

with it and while you hold it you gain a

+2 bonus to spell attack rolls Oh which

is nice but it doesn't turn into

anything

the staff has 50 charges for the

following properties and it regains 46

+2 expended Charlie charges every day at

dawn if you expend the last charge

there's a one in 20 chance the staff

will regain fewer charges than expected

but there's no chance of the staff

becoming unpowered it absorbs spells

insofar as you have advantage on saving

throws against all spouse what yeah

in addition you can use your reaction

when another creature casts a spell that

targets only you if you do the staff

absorbs the magic of the spell canceling

the effect and gaining a number of

charges equal to the spells level Wow

I'm imagining like she's learning these

things her face is like oh oh holding

the staff you can use you can expend

some of its

just to cast the following spells

conjure elemental disc magic I need that

fireball at seventh level whoa flaming

sphere ice storm invisibility knock

lightning bolt at seventh block ice wall

plane shift telekinesis wall of fire and

web she's like sitting there holding the

staff and she's just like you can also

you cast the following spouse without

using any charges arcane lock detect

magic enlarge or reduce light mage hand

or protection from evil and good you can

break the staff over your knee causing a

retributive strike an explosion in a 30

foot radius fear that attempts to

destroy everything within it definitely

not going to do that but it doesn't turn

into anything fun she looks to fall and

says it doesn't turn into anything fun

you can see palton that the runes

there are some runes that don't appear

on the staff normally that light up now

that she's attuned to it are they the

same symbols no oh it lights up real

pretty look you like they're the symbols

of the schools of magic that this is

that the staff can basically casanova

well I like this staff maybe I can just

keep it and then keep my broom - yeah

think I can use both my other staff

turns and do lots of other things I

don't need it to be a staff all the time

and I can make this staff look like mine

if I just stick something on top of it

and tie it on there that's true look at

that look what happens when you just not

freak out about something new what is

just an idea since your other staff is

like a crescent moon what if this one

were a Sun to go no I don't think that's

a no I really don't like that I do every

day no I don't like that it's just a

metal staff with a flared top perfect

place to stick on a crescent also we

don't like that idea again I guess I'll

look at the robe then I'll look at the

I'll look at the road well alright

that's a 24 I don't know if I was a role

different one I was a higher one again

this is something you have to attune to

remember you can only attune to three

items okay I have my staff I know my

staff this staff in the robe I think

that's all I have I don't have anything

else fancy this is a robe of the arch

Magi an elegant garment made of

exquisite black cloth adorned with

silvery runes you gain the following

benefits while wearing the robe if you

aren't wearing armor your base armor

class is 15 plus your dexterity modifier

you had Vantage on saving throws against

spells and other magical effects which

of course you get from the staff your

spell save DC and spell attack bonus

each increase by two that's on top of

the staff ah

is it the evil one yes well and actually

you can't attune to it yes you have its

alignment because it's evil yep

so I shake it and I go this robe evil

yep okay we should burn it

what if one has maybe dappled and evil

no and and you have to be a sorcerer or

warlock or wizard to attune to it well

what if I want it on the inside it says

on a tag only wearable by sorcery I will

say it is very it is a is a perfectly

chrome Yulin Trobe to wear even without

its magical properties your that you

look like a badass right so Strix can

still wear it and look like a badass

well nobody will you know people will

think twice about screwing with her if

she's wearing a black robe with the arch

Magi just saying hmm but then she'll be

evil she's like I'm not evil here

paulten wear it if you want all right

instantly he takes it just does this

nice that works over your bathrobe with

your slippers

yeah with the bunny with the vampire

slippers peeking out underneath

course they have like a giant collar and

stuff too I will leave that to pollens

imagination Bolton's poems running

around with this sure this it's a big

collared black cloak over his purple

robes and vampire sandals running around

screams like I'm Batman again oh my god

and pretty much this behavior is

entirely what happens on the way back

home yeah politic and leaping out of

shadows at every block to try to

surprise you every time there's a small

crate you like hopped up on to it yes

Strix is just like tentatively like

holding the staff like mixing if she

likes how it feels like and if she's

using that one she'll just use her other

staff to be just like a lantern okay

I'm just her side her turn is helpful

because some of your human friends can't

see very well as you make your way back

in the darkened streets to the troll

school alley and you find the manor

house completely dark can I pull the

other side as we're walking though yep

like I just I just wanted to let you

know that I think it's real

inspirational that you're you know

reaching out branching out trying to

move on something that I'm trying to do

too and I just like really admire it you

know what just like trying to move on

from from something that you just feel

isn't gonna happen you know

welp Alton's squatted on a box it's like

evil and what are you talking about well

you know like I'm just made it real

clear that like there's just no chance

and I should never think of him that way

and it's been real hard to move on but

I'm I'm trying I think it's real

inspirational that you're doing the same

Oh

nothing can change how I feel

well I mean it's nice that you're trying

are you trying well no did I speak out

of turn

I don't know I just assumed like the

sparks and everything just kind of

assumed it sparks what sparks with Alice

what I mean you guys have definitely

made out right no are you sure I'm

pretty sure no we have not you totally

did we do not all right well I guess

maybe my my reads are wrong my apologies

and if if you still have the same

feelings for strix why haven't you said

anything to her yet because it's I know

Strix and I know how she thinks and

feels and she's not like us well I mean

that much is obvious but I think her

heart works the same way

well not exactly

she'd to know different people feel and

experience that I love I guess in

different ways and I respect her and I

I don't need her to care for her well I

think that's kind but she kind of puts

her hand on his arm and looks at him

really seriously and she's like just be

sure that if this all ended tomorrow you

wouldn't have any regrets of course not

they continue on yeah it's behind them

chewing on the staff do you think that

so how why are you guys talking so quiet

the waffle house is dark

did we leave lights off I don't remember

leaving anything off maybe Simon put

everyone to bed like a responsible

babysitter what time is it it's about

8:30 at night do that no I will go check

one of the windows that is not the front

of the house so you can go off to the

north side of the house there's no

there's a window on the ground floor

that looks into the tap room there are

windows on the second floor balcony that

look into waffles den there's windows on

the third floor that look into Paul

Tain's bedroom and windows on the fourth

floor that look into D ATS bedroom

alright umm okay I'm back sorry I had to

get my things so I could actually do the

thing can I look in the tower actually

nice sure yeah you see you can

absolutely look in the turret you know

that nobody stays there well that's true

nice day you haven't had time to move

assignment into that turret yet okay I

don't need to check in there I'll guess

I'll check is there any way to look in

the back into the tap room there are no

windows facing the back wall the tap

room however you can peer into your

bedroom even's bedroom or even the kid's

bedroom from the back I'm sorry no you

know you can peek into the kid's bedroom

from the back okay I'll look into the

kid's bedroom then we like everyone stay

I'm just gonna fly up and take a real

quick peek the kids a what there's no

one in there oh they're gone

okay I fly back down land and say the

kids are gone the kids are gone they're

gone it's quiet

wait the kids are gone they're gone okay

hold on no no wait is this the robe I'll

check the shadows all right so you're

gonna go are you really gonna go off and

like check the shadows around the house

bulb

yep all right what's going inside like

I'm sure they're just playing a game

she's gonna go look inside

don't go inside we have to sneak inside

if someone is inside we can't go inside

yet we have to sneak inside tricks is

right we have to sneak in there if they

if the kids aren't there I don't see

anyone in there I can teleport us inside

they'll never find me

why don't we let's do that I will just

get us inside and then we can open the

door from there and whatever is in there

we can sneak up on it just try to

conserve your magic as much as possible

well then I shouldn't do that right I

can get in there at least trace to go up

and out as much as I can even in the

darkness I'm still familiar with our own

house I can make my way around I'll get

in the aerial view you can turn

invisible now cuz of my new stick and I

can check the shadows because I am the

knight I don't know what that means but

I'm gonna use my new stick to turn

myself invisible okay we you turn

invisible

evylyn goes airborne death what do you

do I'm going to stealth my way through

the front not before returning his

tricks me like remember you're invisible

not muted try to stay quiet come on

that's a good bit of advice okay I yell

a lot so you're going in first death yes

okay you creak open the tap room door

you peer into the room it looks very

much like you left it only it's dark and

quiet mmm those bars your quiet palton

reception check you got it perception

not my worst or best that is a 22 okay

what do we see

you see

as you're darting around in the alley

behind the Waffle House three creatures

with glowy eyes stepping out of the

shadows around you one behind you and

two in front of you oh

and they bare they're like surrounding

me yeah

there's two in front of you one behind

you in this alley behind the Waffle

House youths you can see that they're as

tall if not a bit taller than you very

thin but their skin seems to go listen

in the night and they're glowy white

eyes seemed to stare through you and I

need you to make a intelligence saving

throw Oh

hmm this just reminds me of that one

fight and baldur's gate that was so hard

yeah what's that the stairs to the

friendly arms in the other one you

cannot best my mind I wonder what the

darkness 17 okay you are a sailed with

energy that seems to twist and rack your

mind

but you fend it off and now I need you

to make another one scarecrow

again you can trust me I am the knight

now five okay you take 22 points of

psychic damage that's a lot and are

stunned oh that's even worse basically

rendered helpless even you fly up over

the house and look around are you

looking in a window I'm kind of like

just looking like down on the house in

the surrounding area so what I see this

happen to Walton well you're a human so

your vision is somewhat limited by the

night make a perception check Talton

remembering evil he's taking to the sky

is just like Oh

she'll never find us we're one with the

shadows okay you don't see paltin he's

being super skulky vampire man wow he's

doing such a good job hiding in those

shadows you have no idea where he went

and obviously Strix and death went into

the house and everything's quiet up here

I don't notice anything else and

surrounding areas or anything no okay

and there's no damage to the house or

anything like that it's all just sort of

locked up tight alright even gonna go to

her window okay that's on the third

floor there are two windows one facing

the front and one facing the side okay

and look in alright when you look in

make another perception check oh not

twenty must invoke the neighbors

Lysander every time I roll from now on

you see something has happened to your

room a black resin or something has

basically drooled down the walls from

the ceiling and rendered the room very

dark and glisteny this is the same day

as the beach episode yeah I sent news

divine sense a sense if there's like

some it's very evil mmm

sure is evil I mean I assume divine

sense celestial fiend Undead and good

and evil you really lock the doors do we

ever lock the doors

do we have you are sensing the presence

of evil in this and just in a general

sense not any of those particular like

locations or anything like that it seems

to be coming ahead of you and perhaps

above you when you sort of look above

your room you see that the room right

above yours is Warrington months it was

pen pal of his I'm just sure of it cool

cool

even we'll go get every she's gonna go

try to find Diaz and strikethrough went

inside okay you can immediately fly back

down to the front of the house where I

guess the door still open but death you

make your way across the taproom there's

the spiral staircase leading up to the

second floor common room mm-hmm you make

your way up there quietly strix

squeaking on the wooden steps behind you

when you get up to the common room

there's door two waffles den and then a

door to the hallway that leads upstairs

to the third floor off that hallway is

the door to the kids room which you've

already been told was empty when you get

up to that staircase that leads up to

the third floor where evil UNS and paul

tunes bedroom is you hear something on

that floor above you move it's heavy

enough to cause the floorboards on the

ceiling above you to creak and bow

[Music]

well Strix can see me yeah so I guess

silently I'll single to her and kind of

point up but also doing this and there's

just enough moonlight coming through the

windows on the floor above to not render

you in complete darkness okay great then

the two of you hear a sound like I'm

strict like Polk's didn't like try not

to talk but it's the kind of poke that

she does like is this going to kill us

bad should we run away bad she's focused

you know from from different instances

that they're just each thing you can

read exactly what she's saying by

severity of the poke it's not Morse code

but might as well will be yeah evil and

as you come into the tap room there's

just darkness for the most part you

don't see Strix or DF and there's no

light betraying their location you guys

upstairs can probably just barely hear

evil ins downstairs whisper I guess I'll

silently go down to where she should

hopefully be able to see me okay and

then basically through hand gestures and

whispered single words signal how

there's something at the top of the

house yeah it's coming from Warrington's

room its built-in with you

do you think he's having fun paltin your

son out in the alley kind of lying down

on the cold pavement after she says that

cuts to me just like I'm not having fun

you want to take action but your your

brain and your body seemed to be

completely disconnected and looming over

you are these three creatures with

octupole purplish heads and tentacles

coming out of their faces Oh

keep those away from me and one of them

sort of props you up and pulls the hood

back off your head no much and wraps its

tentacles around your head and face you

can repeat the saving throw you need to

repeat you really need to get this

saving throw this is intelligence just

so you know this is really bad

how close is he to me can I give him my

aura nope sixteen you snap out of it Oh

oh my god The Dark Knight Rises it's the

end of your turn will rise moment

alright DF you're with evil in yell

something when I snap you sure can cool

as I snap out of it I just AM like yeah

everybody in the house can hear a

surprisingly distant sounding scream

from outside the house even hears that

she'll look at Diaz and go warrington

through what but wait I was gonna death

Ward you Strix you're upstairs alone on

the second floor when you hear something

heavy

shuffling making its way toward the

stairs

case Oh Oh God uh okay so it's it's

coming towards me it is above you and

heading in your direction all right I am

going to do something because whatever

this is it's bad so I want to try and

like I want to try and like set a trap

or something let's see you're kind of at

the bottom of the staircase it's kind of

approaching the top of the staircase and

the staircase has a bend in it I think

one of the spells that my staff has is

called pass wall yes it says says if you

can make a passage so I can I can kind

of just like make I can make a hole in

the ground more or less yeah you can

create an opening through a wall or

floor yes I'm gonna make a opening in

the floor like right at your feet like

right where I can hear this creature

coming so it's above you

oh it's above me okay then I'm gonna

back up I'm gonna make a hole in the

floor all right where I hear it in the

ceiling you're saying in the ceiling

okay but I'm still invisible absolutely

as the hole forms in the ceiling

underneath the creature it falls through

and lands in front of you and as it gets

up you realize it's about seven feet

tall

mm-hmm very very broad and powerful

mm-hmm

wearing the torn remains of Warrington

months uniform all stretched and torn

and no proportion but his head is now

this octuple thing with big tentacles

coming out of his face

no absolutely massive cool no this is so

sad let's roll initiative Oh No

everybody everybody roll initiative he

was fighting he was fighting the mind

flare

before he got to us so you recall in

this brief moment strips the story fear

the story of Commodore Warrington Montes

relate to you by sergeant pakka

and corporal derm how in a space battle

against mind flayers when his ship ran

out of ammunition

Commodore Muntz catapulted himself onto

the illicit ship to plant a bomb that's

right then sometime thereafter the ship

exploded sending Warrington Mundt

careening down into the ocean now how

long he spent on that ship and what

happened to him aboard that ship before

the bomb went off you have no idea

that's it that's right until now in this

whole time he's being so amorphous the

sized

so Strix what was your initiative I got

19 yes

23 evylyn anyone 21 palton 16 I know

it's a good role for you when I was all

right

DF you hear this loud put this on the

floor above you great um I mean I'm

gonna make my way up there and see what

the heck that was when you get to the

top of the spiral staircase you see what

has become of Commodore month and he is

massive a 7-foot tall 5 foot wide mind

flare

I don't eat I don't and you're the only

one you can really see cuz exercisable

yeah you know Strix is there though

because she just cast that spell for him

to fall through the ceiling actually

that would have made you visible now

that I think about oh I'm here too so he

sees you both I guess when Jesus gets up

there and sees that he actually just

hesitates and then like just is unable

to act okay it's like it's like is that

Mornington but you clearly see the

shredded uniform and even his medals are

still attached to his so yeah there's

like enough of a hesitation there that

he isn't I'm sure if you should attack

it or not and yeah so I guess that'll

just be the end of his turn doesn't know

what to do evylyn you race outside and

come around the alley to see palton

lying with three figures looming above

him all with these squid heads you can

see their night they're dressed in black

dark robes with breastplates over their

shoulders high collars and tentacles

coming out of their faces they turn to

you in their eyes glow do I see clearly

that they've like attacked him yes it

they've attacked me

oh well then leaving sword mm-hmm

flaming sword lights up the alley and

you can charge in and make your attacks

yes please I will take first twenty six

that will do

one moment

oh good rolls 26 okay and with some fire

damage is that including the fire damage

mm-hmm okay

it takes all of that seems badly wounded

by that these creatures aren't don't

look like they're built to take piles

and piles of damage and what's your

second attack it is 22 another hit 14 19

plus 5 is 24 Wow okay

this creature looks quite bloodied after

you strike it with two burnings with two

swings of your burning sword and you

smell it's alien flesh fill the alleyway

it one stands over Politan protectively

it glares and it does sort of recoil

from you in sort of a cowardly shrinking

manner its tentacles twitching it's it's

companions to seem likewise distressed

and that's you next up is Strix oh man

yes okay you sounds nothing but

malevolence from the creature oh yeah I

noticed that deaath is frozen but I know

it's just because he thinks it's

Warrington but I can already tell that

it's bad magic and this isn't anything

we want to deal with or aliens a bad

aliens I don't know they aren't aliens

and that really upsets me so god I am

not happy with this at all and I'm going

to try my god there's not even a reason

to try and do that either I guess I want

to try and hold him so I'm gonna try and

cast animate object and I know there's

got to be some chairs or something or

something around here that I can animate

there are some chairs but they look kind

of small compared to him

there's though there's the banister of

the staircase next to him which is

bigger okay I guess I can animate that

and I want to have it wrap around him

okay well then just kind of grapple him

okay we can consider that banister the

railing a large object in its entirety

okay so make an attack with a +6 bonus

to hit so do twenty plus six yeah I

think yeah so so that's 16 okay you are

able to hit him roll 2d 10+2 of a damage

this banister get him banister okay so

that's uh that's only eight damage eight

okay but he is grappled yeah and it sort

of coils around him in a way that it's

really trying to hold him fast right he

gets to make an attempt and I try and I

also try and tell Dee it's like it's not

him it's not him and that's Strix is

turned next it is Paul Tain's turn okay

so while I'm still just kind of lying

there telepathically do I sense that my

hand from hell's nearby yes would I be

able before I take an action to just

like call it over and grab them yeah we

can assume was sort of crawling around

like somewhere in your robe or something

like that so you can just pop out of

your robe okay cool

so without even really these guys are

like still kind of on me yeah so I'm

just kind of laying there it's like all

right the night is pissed off and I just

like just like without getting up I just

hold up a hand and like the hand-drew

crawls up my arm I just grab it okay and

then while holding it I'm just gonna

cast a fifth level Thunder wave on them

okay

and so because I'm holding him it is

plus three nice to beat okay so that

would so the CDC

is now a 20 okay they all failed

yeet so a thunderous blast erupts in

this alleyway everybody in the this part

of the neighborhoods gonna hear it and

you send all three of these creatures

careening away from you and let me roll

this 33 ow okay as they go tumbling

backward it's very clear that the one

evil and injured previously is dead cuz

it just flops down onto the ground with

no signs of life the other two are blown

back ten feet but are still alive mmm no

just kind of get up now and just brush

myself off yeah that's what you do it's

like and your hand will just crawl up

onto your shoulder y'all did not cool

all right

and Chad pointed out still wearing the

estrade slippers absolutely yes so

alright that's like cloak Amba like is

like just regular like cabs down or like

exposed under the robe mm-hmm on the

creatures turn the ones in the alleyway

you see the two of them pick up their

dead third friend just sort of hold his

lifeless body between them and then they

levitate up into the air oh no I hate it

you can see something about the way

their composure suggests that they are

attempting to escape so they simply

levitate up high up into the sky just

then they get just above the roofline of

the Waffle House and they're done

big guy is going to try to break free of

the banister roll a d20 for me Strix and

add to 7 okay he shatters free or breaks

a portion of the banister that's holding

him and it's now free he slowed him down

a little well yeah now he had to use his

action that was my point

it was hoping to us to get away from him

so he can't grab us so once he gets free

he will just move to you Strix and loom

above you oh boy his his tentacles

moving hungrily and then it is DF turn

to like immediately tumbles to his

backside and just screams get back in

boy stabbed him in the backwards gutter

okay 13 that hits

oh he's not armored yeah he's large so I

know he moved up in lose districts is he

is close enough that he has engaged with

Strix so you get your sneak attack good

taking it feels bad it feels bad it all

feels bad yeah I feel bad not being nice

to him this is what I get I take no joy

in this

this is shockingly high 22 good he has a

lot of hit points 31 36 38 40 3 total

okay on top of the 8 that the banister

did you've done total of 51 points of

damage to him ok he's not bloodied

alright so that's a good stab from DF he

definitely felt it and next is evil and

so you're down with paltin there I think

since those ones are in retreat and I

knew something crazy was happening in

the house

I'll look to paltin and be like are you

all right I've risen wonderful okay

let's go inside the house and help

daehan and Strix

was like looking up at them flooding I

was like but but I have a fun idea for

that okay well don't worry I'll I'll

handle this okay and if you get hurt

again okay

oh my god I will okay and then even I'll

follow districts okay so you go back

into the house evylyn it'll take all

your movement even it's like into the

house and up the stairs to see this

creature that dia and Strix are

confronting Oh No and then Strix you're

next okay I don't like that he is uh

there in front of me so first off I'm

gonna go in head and misty step behind

him away from the tentacles because I

know what those do and then I am going

to oh when we're on the we're still

we're still um there's a second floor on

the second at the head of the stairs

yeah we're at the bottom of the stairs

yeah okay alright I can't do that and is

the is the banisters still animated yes

and you can still make attacks with it

if you want to okay yeah I want the

banister to grapple I'm again okay make

another attack plus six okay right ah

demon world one god no it flails but

misses but you still take your action

I'm just like this house sucks alright

well it doesn't work but I'm going to

oh my god there's their way that I think

that maybe he can't be polymorphed or do

I not know you don't know ok I'm not I'm

not even gonna this is an abomination I

don't am just like and also the baby

chick traumatized me so I'm just not I

can't do that right now

so I think what I'm gonna try and do is

I'm going to try and word is that if

they're willing for reducing their size

and large reduce I'm looking right now

oh no actually if I'm already doing

animate object that's to concentration

spells I can't do it alright okay um so

what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna slap

a deaf board on D F okay so she missed

he stands behind him and you just feel

it like death war on your back and she

announces it's a deaf board yes alright

and then I'm done okay that's tricks

next up is palton so how far up have

these things floated sixty feet okay

cool as they're like trying to float

away I just like look up I want to see

if I can get their attention

first I'm just like they are watching

you yeah yeah alright so I just look I'm

like hey I got a better idea I'm

gonna hold up hand Roo again and then

I'm going to cast crown of madness all

right Andrew does a little gesticulation

mm-hmm and that would be 20 again okay

and this is what kind of save wisdom yes

alright this they're actually kind of

good at and you're targeting I assume

one of the living ones obviously holding

that buddy okay

he succeeded at the savings from where's

mine so yeah so anyway well I would've

been fun yeah

can you at least have hand roux give

them the finger I assume it he's just

doing that like that's how you cast the

spell all right

so next on their turn they levitate up

another 60 feet so they're 120 feet up

and way up in the night sky pollen you

can barely even see them except for

their malignant glowing eyes at least

the two ones that you didn't kill and

yeah to start heading into yes you sure

can you can get oh so yeah like they got

away you can get into the house and hear

the fracas upstairs but you can't see

the horror that was Warrington Mundt who

attacks it's Bradley for the best DF

you're his target well you receive a

telepathic message and then he his

tentacles try to wrap around your head

22

there's my armor class yeah yep alright

wait wait am i there does that help is

that a magical attack oh it is just a

regular attack I can still use a bonus

action to impose disadvantage it's not

your turn so bonus I mean a reaction yes

you can do that you know as disadvantage

that is a 19

okay so it would normally hit me but I

had this blade mastery feat and I can

use that read my reaction to enter a

sort of Terry stance and give myself one

more armor class until the end till my

next turn so I do that okay I'm a class

20 okay

my mom arm and you yeah it's like

between the mom arm and then like using

my sword to kind of get myself away

excellent now it's your turn

oh god it's so scary

yeah bells go like

Harriette's like an immediate another

stab right into his torso

especially now that evylyn is here

assistant yeah you want to ask them in

the midst of combat isn't there anything

we can do to say them Strix is making

the eyes that there is nothing you can

do to save him

yeah really don't see the idea it's kind

of react to that you just you just kind

of see him making like hurtful stabs at

this creature like it's like it hurts

yes to do like it's not me like fear or

hatred or anger or survivals on his face

it's more just I don't know I know

everyone can see that he doesn't want to

do this but has decided he has to yeah

roll a 16 on that stabbed hip 16:23

$27.99 Wow all right he has now taken 90

points of damage and is bloodied these

idol champions dies I've been working

out those guys forgive me some extra D

sixes evylyn you are in melee combat

with this creature

do you like Steel's herself because she

also doesn't want to do this but she

trusts that death wouldn't be doing it

if it weren't necessary because she

readies the flame sword and takes a

slash 4:28 that hits and it does are you

defined smiting no 20 damage on the

first attack okay that hits he's still

up

17 damage okay yes that one

can I throw a divine smite on that one

now sure you can okay that's gonna add

let me just double check I always forget

how many the eight is no - my - d8 + 1

d8 he's not an undead or a fiend right

no he's an operation so I'll just do it

at first level okay B 1 + 1

literally snake eyes on that so 2 extra

okay you still up and that brings us to

Strix all right

I'm really glad just for the record that

I attuned to this staff while we were

just shooting around earlier because

call that uh I was just like this is a

nice character development moment and

I'm just like oh well good job past past

me so yeah I'm gonna try and cast

lightning bolt it's a seventh level

spell and takes seven charges from my

staff yeah say V is 12 out of your 50

charges yep

they have he was your old a whopping

five on his saving throw so he takes his

lightning bolt right in the chest 12 d6

so give me a second

I do what I have to okay so alright so

that's 12 six three seven three nine

forty four one forty two forty three so

two more so it's 43 9 4 6 4 7 48 alright

this absolutely massive discharge of

lightning shoots out of the tip of Strix

his staff blasts this hulking creature

right in the chest and he just stands

there his body

quaking shivering as he's electrified

before your eyes she just keeps saying

I'm sorry I'm sorry

as it just pulses into him you see this

massive creature dropped to its knees

and then fall on its face dead in front

of you I'm sorry

I'm sorry Paula she just she's so sorry

I don't have enough movement to get up

to the scene now you do and you see this

massive mind flare still jerking on the

floor with little lightning bolts arcing

across its dead body like walks in the

room holding hands like I don't worry

I'm here they got away I miss ah

Oh what what explain

someone explain yeah what am I looking

drinks is just kind of like fallen to

the ground is kind of just crying cuz

it's just she was she didn't want to be

mean to him she didn't want to see what

happened why is he like this can we fix

it

what is he what is that why do we want

to check to train exceed what this is

are they are connage I can absolutely

making our kind of check waiting

anything to me as me yelling questions

actually I'm gonna use my that's 19 are

we still leaving an initiative so your

turn technically Politan well I'm gonna

if no one gives me answers I'm gonna try

and blow it up cuz it's scary and looks

like it was hurting okay it does look to

you clearly like it is dead okay it's

warrington alright you're arcana check

reveals something you had read about

about mind flayers and there's lots of

cautionary tales about mind flayers well

i know that one of the most distressing

things that they had they do is they

procreate and the way they procreate is

they plant a tadpole in a humanoid host

and that tadpole performs a

called Sara more Phasis the

transformation of the host body into a

new mind flayer that's how mind flares

are born you know strikes chills kind of

like a creature becomes the mind flayer

at that point the the transformation is

irrevocable

she'll explain this to them and say he's

he became one of them and it wasn't his

choice

well what if we took him to the spires

and we had a resurrection and he came

back who doesn't work like that

we can't we can't he would need a true

resurrection and we can't he's he's gone

that's not how this works

it's a comb with his brain is gone it

eats his brain and if we don't check

everyone in this house somehow that they

might have one of those inside of them

too because those lines layers were just

here and that's where we stop so we had

our beach episode now we have like our

earth are like annual physical episode

no this is definitely the alien invasion

episode next week we'll see you whether

the children Oh God

all right any announcements everything's

terrible we were gonna do the auction

on Friday is that why you're gonna be

gone so nothing bad happens to evil no

gone and I will miss you all very nice

you we won't set the house on fire while

you're gone

no promises

find the children I feel like there was

something else to announce but I can't

think okay so if I sounded weird tonight

it's because I'm suffering from a cold I

took lots of medication before the show

so hopefully it didn't didn't sound too

weird yeah challenge to Chris Perkins

for coming in and doing the show so sick

and the land the fact that there's this

most snow in 40 years in Seattle well

that's that's the tricky part

stranger to snow thank you Chris yeah no

worries

yeah all right so if there if there are

no announcements check out the subreddit
