alright so let's jump into the action

now that we've gotten through that

little bit of happy business previously

in dice camera action

evylyn got turned to stone by the

zennith R and as she was being carried

through the air

palton came along a thunder wave does

anethe are causing evylyn to fall and

shatter upon the floor DF and palton and

Strix were able to dispose of the

malevolent to beholder and were left to

pick up the pieces

I helped absolutely true yes everybody

got an attack on this

at one point so the beholder is no more

evylyn is shattered bits of statuary

that paltin and Strix are beginning to

reassemble and DF having dealt the

killing blow to the beholder crime lord

has just been declared zenith our leader

of the zenith our guild amethyst that is

self declares I really know how much

weight that really holds well you sent

Amerigo the majordomo off with

instructions and he sort of the the

second-in-command here has basically he

seems to be following your orders so

that's a good sign

I did not realize he was second in

command I thought he was just a dork I

thought he's a Minotaur mm-hmm ya know

it turns out the Santa thar hires the

worst people the a pathar yeah at the

far one other minor footnote while DF

was making his way around the lair by

his lonesome he stumbled into an arena

where he had a reunion of sorts with an

old friend acquaintance a hippo man a

gif named Warrington Munt who is now

accompanying death out of the arena and

rejoining their friends so I guess I'll

just kind of bring Warrington with me

anjaii to return to appalled tune in

Strix and evil one

okay bye now paltin and Strix have kind

of assembled

evylyn as much as possible using all the

pieces that they've been able to find

Bolton's just like like just like curled

up and like rocking back and forth just

about oh oops well this is a fine kettle

of fish I'm glad you asked so it started

in my tireless hunt for a suitable

weapon and ammunition and it led me here

I heard rumors that the Sabbath our

guild had been hoarding smoke powder

which as I've come to understand is

illegal in this city I don't know why

but I made my way down here and found

myself beset besieged as it were and

forced to make a decision ultimately

fighting in the arena to earn this

anitha's trust that's the place in this

organization so I can get access to the

smoke powder and questrom which I

believe is being held in large supply

somewhere in this dungeon by an

individual named Naru

well that's very clear so NarL just

there's do you touch what do you know

about gnarley' snarl some sort of he is

a dark elf like an inventory keeper or

is he just a car it's a particular room

there's an authority advisor and the one

who secured the smoke powder in question

to begin with was the ANA that are gonna

use the smoke powder to blow anything up

though I namely the spires of the

morning I can't imagine he would use it

for anything else but perhaps perhaps we

should at least for the moment put the

smoke how to issue aside and deal with

the issue of your shattered tally

[Laughter]

tactful as ever Warrington appreciated

if we put evylyn together I do have a

stone to flesh potion that was thrown

onto my disheveled body during the

c-team episode and I have forgotten that

it is attached somewhere to be so I will

reach in in the robes somewhere and I

like I'll pull out like a happy you can

eat and pie and like throw that and I'll

pull out like maybe like a couple of

scraps of leather and throw those and

then I'll like reach four and pull it

out a little while and be like I've had

this all along and you recalled Strix

that you had been using mending spells

to start attaching bits of people in

that you could easily tell fit together

properly so we got the potion you're

still using your mending hand trips to

attach pieces one after another to

Evelyn Warrington will just say you know

I I was a field medic early in my career

during the artic invasion of palance's

I'm sure that's a real thing

I could probably help you solve this

jigsaw puzzle I didn't think that goes

there maybe that piece is meant to go

over there look he sort of reaches down

it starts moving bits of evil and around

can I telogen right sure Oh

bones still rocking now he's just kind

of just like a normal link to himself

okay yes we can rebuild her what do you

think mumbling discernible things I

think he's saying something about her

being fine and I don't know this might

be an opportunity to make her a little

bit taller working mom Warrington and

just push him back like a mom arm him

back and just be like Warrington know

yeah I'm not changing a thing I think

she's fine Diaz why don't you look at

her well Paulson's having a problem and

you see if she looked pretty much the

same I'll try I guess I'll try to take a

look too because they've assembled like

you said probably most of our yeah

spending quite a bit yeah and then based

off my own memory of the evil wind I

guess I'll try to figure out how

accurate their current sure pile is yeah

make an intelligence check okay hey yeah

good I got a good 18 yeah it was going

better before Warrington started to move

some stuff around okay so you kind of

put things back and you're pretty sure

that Strix and paltin had it more or

less right all right

arm come up to you on Warrington that's

probably right on his crotch

Strix realizes knives like that he's

fine and then he he says I understand my

service is probably better rented as I'm

the RAL officer yeah Warrington and you

were just so helpful and you're just man

all you really did help make sure that

we got evil and just right or really

really appreciate why are you moving

everything back the way it was like oh

boy Tim can you tell us about some smoke

powder I what's over it

he looks over the way your point again

he says that just a wall madam and he

says but you Pippin what's up

unresponsive he's just like glazed over

looking just like dead she's

dead she died again okay at this point

is every piece of evil in more or less

together is she like a whole stature now

or there's nothing left there's mending

left to do but you can't see there are

no prominent pieces missing or anything

oh alright

well strict's it's gonna be up to you to

keep mending here back together the only

one who can do this

alton cannot make sure that everything

goes correctly why don't you talk to

Paul Cindy he's a little messed up right

now and I don't think that I have the

emotional capacity to help someone

worrying about people dying Warrington

gives a Pippin a little kick on the foot

with his foot like also like balled up

and not paying attention as as

Warrington kicked him he just kind of

like almost like an egg just kind of is

rolled onto his side no no reaction just

still Warrington will kneel down over

you and just sort of put a hand on your

toppled over arm and say back up there

young man

everything will be set right what no

need to worry this is only a momentary

setback I've seen worse

it's it's still just the same stuff he's

just like she's dead everyone dies I

understand I I just like because of me

I'll do anything they just died she's

not dead she's just a little broken up

dead

aren't we all worried dentists and

strikes is gonna walk over and start

trying to like I don't know read the

back of the instructions of the potion

on Mike how long the microwave it or

whatever to give it to people

okay you're just reading the label okay

yeah it's a it's not something that it's

meant to be quaffed you just sort of

pour it onto the stone and magically

theoretically it restores the stone to

flesh it's not meant to be it's not

meant to be imbibed

yeah okay and Warrington says to you

palton so this isn't the first time this

has happened

right hmm just dead dawn always always

death I just watch yes grunts but after

every death has she not returned to him

it's just dead she's dead can't like

just dawn he says bodies are such frail

things but spirits now those can be

indomitable tricks like looks back from

radio she's like he's right he's

probably like I don't know he's from

just like the Stars or something but you

know that the gods do the powers and

sigil and space you've seen that your

weird thing yes watch now this will take

care of it you have to be optimistic

Pippin this won't work the old magic see

this like kind of like uncorks the

potion and just like okay as you do the

liquid flows out of the container over

the stone and seems to leap across all

the sort of pieces of stone

and kind of magically all knit them

together into one and instantaneously

evil interns from a mostly assembled

statue even her little bits that you

couldn't just sort of mend the little

pimpled

cracks where you know she was basically

reduced to powder

you couldn't just physically reassemble

properly those seem to just sort of get

glossed over by the magic of this potion

so it's the potion sort of works as long

as you have like 99% of it the other 1%

is sort of magically filled in I'm sure

there was what at one point where Strix

was like a like a bent puzzle piece

trying to stick a PS so at first these

sort of magical cracks in evil and still

kind of almost look like scars but then

they just sort of fade away and she has

restored whole and is alive with one hit

point I like put a hand up at evylyn and

like point over the design with ours

bodies like it's okay it's okay

you got them see no I'm done what how

did where did where did you guys come

from he turned you into a statue and

restored you back thanks I'm Walter

pulsons in a heap on the ground so you

should go like I don't know tell him

that you're not dead anymore because he

turned into an egg you look evil and

goes and like kneels down on the ground

and he's like a tipped over she like

tips over too and just curls down he's

completely non-responsive yeah his eyes

are just like glossed over just like

staring off into infinity still just

like mumbling I've seen this on the

battlefield it is a form of shock

a blanket over him a blanket yes so he

doesn't get cold she takes his cloak of

billowing and kind of like knocks it

under his chin a little bit

yes put hands on his cheeks and she's

like hey Suns getting real low big guy

[Laughter]

nothing yes he's still just like dead

just everyone great exercise just I

can't fix brain problems and that looks

like a brain problem to me what's that

probably Zenith or something oh he's

just I think he just he watched your

diet you might have turned up but like

it goes you might have been a stone

statue and then you might have been

dropped and your pieces might I might

have had to put your pieces back

together like a puzzle well what does

that have to do with him he was sad I

think I'm just like your Paulding he's

just like is my fault you just did dead

it was cousin me didn't have to it was

me just yep every time every I was des

yes he does

I thought you were dead you weren't dead

you weren't dead you were does that mean

dead sleeping let's be honest but I've

you were just out cold as a rock and

then you were dropped until we put you

back together and now you're fine

so well he doesn't usually get like this

when I think he's just seen it too many

times at this point that's my guess I

mean I've seen it a lot of times too but

it did you know sometimes it's just bad

even kind of just like considers him and

then she like wraps the little egg

thoughts in this tight in the cloak she

can and she just picks him up she's

really strong and she just awkwardly

like toddles him over to the rest of the

group she's like there there yes this

it's the same same expression just still

just like nothing like how do you how do

you

fix this candy-ass actually go up to

them and grab them by that cloak right

Haller

and then lift him up to his feet nice so

they're looking eye to eye at India it's

gonna slap him across the face as hard

as he can now don't fight and

shakes them back into the effin culture

of looking eye to eye again right now

and just say stop it stop it right now

this is not your fault nothing's

happened she is not dead she is right

there

bail bail saved her look right there

she's right there gets you saved drops

you stood up to the zenith are no one in

Waterdeep stands up to the zenith are oh

the moment she was in danger you did so

you saved her life

knock it off right now and then shove

her away yeah like as he pushes Paul and

Paul and just kind of like falls back

he's not mumbling but he's still just

kind of staring off that's really about

it

I had me he was a nice little bundle and

I was taking care of my dad to slap him

Warrington Mundt will come up and say

yes this is working and then slap Alton

how do you feel now Pippin

that's a the shock wearing off you just

like I deserve that you did a good thing

like stands in front of him and she's

like no more slapping Yulin are you okay

can you move I think so

misterx laps herself what is wrong with

you guys

I felt sleeping now everything's crazy

it is very clear that Pippin believes

that he is somehow responsible for your

breakage she looks him in the eye she's

like you're not responsible the Zanna

Thor is responsible and I'm fine

everyone everyone everyone dies and I

just watch not

even there none of us are dead actually

Paulson you all died

I believe I watched and I was there so

don't hey bet cuz I brought you guys

back and it was fine

evylyn takes Paul Tunes face and like

smushes it like this and she's like look

and she shows him yet she's like the SL

AB shows him Strix Strix is alive

I'm alive you're alive

everyone's alive no one's dead Zanna

Thor is not alive he looks at this

corpse of the beholder lying on the

floor ding-dong I believe there's a no

thought is dead oh speaking of Strix

jawani bits from that thing i was just

going to ask thank you for reading my

mind she'll just like walk over and just

like sticker on her window it may be

some ice talks I know what you need

Pippen a smoke powder hunt I have it on

good authority that the zennith are was

hoarding the stuff down here well it is

very dangerous and unstable perhaps we

should take it from this place and store

it somewhere safe that sounds good as

long as he's actually ok Paulding just

like eggs back oh yes it says this is

exactly what we need we need a mission

well we can't mission with him like an

egg well this won't take his mind off it

this soldier self-loathing I can hit him

I think I think what pass the hitting ya

know that you got a turn

[Laughter]

so what what are our objectives smoke

powder cuz that sounds dangerous

never we did promise you smoke putter

quite some time back then along with

that we also need to get the hell out of

here or perhaps look for really really

useful information maybe one thing at a

time okay origin is dead like a just a

cursor when you look at the Saylor Strix

is like half bodily into his like corpse

looks like rooting around he's dead we

what who I I remember stabbing him even

though he told me not to dear he did it

- he killed them he did it using this

little study he did exactly what you

told him God to do you killed his an

authority yet no I mean wasn't simple

well even an evil creature such as this

should have its last rites

oh holy morning Lord blessed are you as

you shine upon us in the light of a new

dawn especially a new dawn for evil evil

horrible beings like this one who I'm

not angry at I'm just glad that he will

no longer be able to hurt anyone or take

away their choices and that is as you

wish I'm sure bless his soul and may he

find peace if he turns good in the

afterlife also please help Paulson not

being a gay man I think I found his

brain in here as your search as you're

searching the corpse you can see

around a couple of his eyestalks are

what appear to be magic rings oh holy

 I actually found something and not

just that wasn't just gross

I'll pull those out and like covered in

goop and hold them up everyone yeah you

can see you can see two magic rings that

he was wearing on eyestalks once you cut

the eye stalks off you can slip the

Rings off and they kind of shrink down

to normal size can i Arcana check them

you so you you can't already know

they're magical you'd have to cast an

identify spell which you don't know

right or you can put one on and you know

attune to it and Galena's babies that

way maybe you should put anything on

right now zan if I was wearing it who

knows what it can be no strikes it does

remind me digital Wow retrieved the

scroll and wand that he got from the

fishtank

trust yeah and hand those over to her

and be like anything you can find out

about these like it's really excited

absolutely

they will look magicky yes I figured the

scroll at the very least you could read

when you pop open the scroll you can see

that it contains what appears to be a

map oh she looks and goes not magic

looks treasury and hands here it is in

fact DF based on your casual inspection

a map of the Zanna thar's dungeon oh my

god so and it has key places marked like

the audience chamber the arena there's a

room marked dead Zanna thar's there is

there's a room marked my room which is

has the room with the tank in it yeah

and then there's a room marked

panoptic surveillance Panoptix

surveillance yeah bags that even mean

yeah loud ah yes panoptic surveillance

um I believe it means surveillance with

disappearing objects with Panoptix yes

Thank You Warrenton some some sort of

visual surveillance system okay well

I'll actually try to take this map and

maybe to look come prett towards warrant

a like this in these possible locations

here rooms here that any of these look

like they could possibly have hold the

smoke powder that you've been looking

for he says oh well let's see there's

the arena and there's the cell where I

was briefly incarcerated so most of that

most of the guards and such Litton than

they were never one this must be these

rooms here and over here oh that must be

where they oh that's the dense anitha's

sounds gross ah

so I believe that they must let's see

I've been over here and I've been over

there and these are mostly quarters so

I'm guessing that where we defined it it

might be down in this corner of the

dungeon on the lower level here the

lower level probably near there where

they keep the dead zone of us since okay

that's probably our best chance let's

see it was just to go down this hole

here turn left and then another right

and then down the stairs and we're

almost there

does this map show the secret trapdoor I

found in that audience chamber it does

and below it you can see that there is a

staircase leading down to the lower

level

Oh one of one of two three staircases

really that lead there does it look like

it'd be the best one to get down to the

lower level it's actually not the close

not the best way to go the ways that

warrington wants to go gaming fine all

right well that's probably our best

chance so I start looking for some of

this smoke powder maybe you can even use

this and maybe even set some traps just

in case we need a nuke this place but

we get out of here mm-hmm

jolly good

all right all right that's the best

Chancellor start looking so we'll start

going for that evening Strix Alton even

goes in like hacks out a whole bunch of

stone dust ready

oh those weren't your pieces I guess

Chris just as a question since

technically I was dead and came back

does my hit point max get recharged

I'm all healed up no you'll have to take

a long rest no no I mean like my hip

point mouth it's lowered from waffles

Inc oh gosh

wow so I got put back together all nice

yeah I'll say yeah you're back hey hey

you Patrick Rothfuss town yeah that

works

he RBIs every time as you follow your

way your make your way through out of

this hallway to a narrower hallway to a

staircase that winds down about halfway

down the staircase you can hear a voice

ahead of you sort of a grumbly voice and

as you round the corner of this of this

winding staircase you see on the

staircase fixing what appears to be a

lopsided step is a dwarf and he sort of

jacked up one end of the step stuffed a

big kind of wrench underneath it to prop

it up until he can actually kind of

rebuild this half-sunken stair but he

hears you coming and he sort of looks up

at you you can see that he has red hair

and a real long red beard that's sort of

braided so that it's bifurcated it

splits in two like a fork and floating

next to him is an albino beholder about

the size of a baseball or a grapefruit

and it's got four little Wiggly eye

stalks strix you remember seeing this

duo making their way through the

audience chamber so as you descend you

are confronted by this dwarf and his

mini albino beholder Kim yeah I just

looked I'm just like oh you better tell

them that you're the Santa thought I'm

pretty sure he works for what whatever a

dead thing though wait he better tell

him though what okay

so this I have not seen nobody has seen

this Dorf except for Strix right you can

see he's got an apron on and it's sort

of dirty and muddy and he's just sort of

when he sees you come he kind of rubs

his the the dust off his hands

looks okay diesel look at him right in

the eyes and say Who am I

he says dear Woodrow wrong I am the

zanaffar I think it pardon I I am this

an ATAR a sigmoidal about it even goes

districts what is he talking about why

is he pretending to be the sign of God

just let's let him do it I think it's

making him feel like he's yes as Slayer

the Zenit are I am the Sabbath are the

Salazar's dead does Anna Faris dead long

live das Anna par don't get me wrong I'm

a glad he's dead

he should have be dead my name is Thor

even a twin beard I am a dwarf obviously

and I have been spying on this Anna thar

as his trap Smith and engineer for over

a year now

oh you can stop lying and that's good oh

thank god he says the Zanna Thor is dead

that's good news I worked for the

Harper's the Harper's yes last time we

met someone to work for the Harper's

they got toasted by a dragon water maid

were evil wait so you've been working

here for years spying on them that's

right Deus motions to the small I will

bind all beholder alongside of thing and

then what's that is Alby is a little

abnormal most gazers they the zenith are

dreamed them into existence and they

serve as his eyes but Alby is weird and

he's not really connected and never was

properly connected to the zenith are so

he just took to follow into me around

instead don't worry he's joined our side

he's so cute can I walk up to him and

give him a little scratching oh yeah

absolutely and when you do that his eye

stalks just sort of go limp for a moment

Oh drool just starts coming out of it

I'm gonna bring him closer just like

snuggling disgusted by it but I she's

like well I guess he's yours now if the

Zephyr is dead then my job is sort of

done here and don't I can't really take

him back to where I come from remember

during the panel and we were like what

will our next pet well I guess my work

is done here

good luck with you and your adventures

wait wait where's the glowy epi powder

oh yes you're the smoke powder resides I

do in fact it was always my intention to

try to steal it and plant it around this

place and collapse it all in same well

it's being it's being held by an evil

drow named gnarls a brindis but you

better watch out because he has a growl

bodyguard I can help you take he sort of

waxes big wrench and hanison I can help

you take care of him if you like right

well if we can get past them into that

smoke powder that's exactly what they

need

now if you've been out here long enough

and also been spying around the Sabbath

Power has always had a very large

information network do you know perhaps

they've retained all information when

within documents or archives or anything

somewhere in here oh nothing so

organized the zenith or was he wanted to

get all the information himself he

didn't trust anybody with it so he had

his spies come to him and deliver

through words not recorded per se but I

know for a fact that Darryl's a brindis

slippery drow that is kept secret notes

in a book do you or do you know where

Gnarls book is it's with Naru let's go

kill that face and you can have

this book that sounds

new brands all right he marches you down

the stairs into a hallway takes you down

the hallway to where it splits like a

tee with a door going to the left and a

door going to the south or the left into

the right he takes you to the door on

the right and knocks on it with his big

wrench okay and the door opens and on

the other side is an exasperated looking

dark elf in a sort of crusty moldy old

robe and floating in and there's no

light in the room that he's in which

doesn't surprise you since Dark Elves

can see in the dark right but floating

in the darkness behind him is a

tentacled creature that's just barely

visible to your eyes DF but those of you

who aren't human namely Strix and

thorvin can see it clearly Strix what

you see is a big floating Grell about

five feet behind him I think about how I

wish I could have one of those as a pet

it's got a beak and I want to squish it

it's gonna kill us

and thorvin says Narula they're here for

the smoke powder and NarL sort of looks

you all up and down sees the big hippo

man in the back punching into a hand and

he says

you can have it if the xerath are is

dead if all that I have heard is true

then I have no further need for it know

where Charles passed I was going to use

it to blow the place up weird that's

actually kind of what we want to do for

do you see I don't actually work for the

Senate are I work through and then

thorvin just hits him on just stomps him

on the foot with his big wrench and says

enough for talk take us to the smoke

powder won't finish it's very rude to

interrupt people especially when you hit

them and the elf says oh I said too much

please follow me

wait no what no what this is shady I'm

getting shady vibes about this he will

he will sink back into the depths of his

office and he'll push the growl aside

just sort of move his tentacles away to

expose a wall and then he sort of taps

on the floor a couple times with his

foot and the wall gives way to reveal a

secret door meet way like it's gonna

whisper to you like I don't know but I'm

starting to trust a little door friend

less than less my Services says the elf

I no longer required I think I will take

my leave unfortunately my friend here

will not let me go alive so if you would

be so kind as to kill this growl I can

be on my way certainly we can do that

for you gnarl oh yes I heard that you

like to keep a little book of yours oh

yes

consider it simple payment for us

freeing you from this creature he digs

into his robe in an inner pocket and he

pulls out a dog-eared frayed book that

looks like a journal and he says all of

his illicit dealings all of his

transactions I've covered them all in

the pages here it's all written in

elvish good luck I'll still take it and

I'll look at neurons I didn't speak

elvish you see

you've done incredible work Norrell yes

yes I hope I hope I hope the boss

appreciates all that I've done yeah boss

it's better not to say for all concerned

sometimes it can make you feel better to

say you know sometimes it can really

just unburden your soul it's true but if

I were to tell you he would probably

kill me I mean I don't think so we don't

really kill that many people no we

usually just get killed ourselves yeah I

mean I was I was better just a little

bit ago I didn't even know it you know

death great she was dead by the way this

was just going on assumption but I was

still kind of egged up so I'm assuming

like evil and just kind of grabbed me

like a knapsack

okay cool just making sure you know

tugging you yes yeah gnarled gnarl says

that I don't think there's an earth our

trusted me very much which is why he had

the ground follow me around everywhere

that makes sense but you feel better if

say you wrote down what if we compelled

you to tell the truth you want us to woo

zona coos you know he says I work for

breagan death see don't you feel better

now yeah who's that do I know who that

is

make a intelligence history check yeah

if it's a water Davian dude history yeah

18 that's pretty good yeah I will say

that that is high enough for you to know

or or to have heard rumors that brigand

death isn't a person it is a guild of

mercenaries specifically drow

mercenaries chosen cool might be worse

than that okay it's worse all right

well they're based in the Underdark

certainly well we did promise him to let

him help him leave so how hard is it to

kill Grell he says well by myself quite

difficult with all of you I suspect

quite easy oh I think he's on to us well

the girl is getting a little twitchy I

was going to say is it gonna be like

docile can we is like I'll stand around

them and then all at the same time like

he's really cute to kill him we've done

so much killing today already I mean

he's trying Polly more of him he can

just live in here it'll be fine thorvin

will point out they're both evil clear

why did you have to say that yeah I mean

if it's used by zenith are and are

created by ham it's not something I was

like no no I'm helpful evil evil is just

kind of like worried about paltin and

like barely paying attention to the do's

and don'ts she's kind of like thorvin

says if you have seen the crimes that

I've seen these two commits you and not

even doubt their lies are for it Paul is

just like everything everyone dies

anyway he was gonna die so like was

wasn't no more talking about killing

around paltin he's very sensitive right

now

Gnarls like why can't we just all go our

own ways yeah I'm kind climb to agree

with Niall what-what-what-what adage

Enda do you have here trap master

thorvin says I I was here to spy on this

Anitha for my masters in water deep but

I know firsthand that this drow

authorized the capture of people from

the city and had them brains devoured

excised and replaced with brain monsters

he helped orchestrate all that dear

turns to NarL gnarl is this true yes but

it was all done under duress you

understand I had to infiltrate to get

close to the Santa thar get rid of his

other advisors so we would trust only me

and in order to do that we had to do

some things capture some individuals

that he could use as spies we didn't

have really a network until that idea

was put forth by me it's true but and

yes it's the mind flare was my friend

yes true all true but let's put that

behind us

and now look to the future look to the

future the Santa Thor is dead and all of

that can stop now and I promise to

curtail my dealings with mine flavors in

the future and not not in any way

threaten water davian's with brain

excision henceforth what's five my gain

from my I'm getting from this dude from

the drow yeah you think you think he

make an inside check actually she was

just being like oh do you need the

excuse oh so no truth but I mean we can

make it real if you wanted the inside

was eight so okay it's all you can tell

is that NarL seems to be very there's

there's obviously something wrong with

him I mean he is he is not mentally

stable right and thorvin sir seems to

have it out for him

oh yes I mean at the same time thorvin

seemed didn't know who he is and or who

he works for thorvin who said who is it

that you said you work for again I work

for yes I work for a lady larold silver

hand of Waterdeep do I know who that is

she's the open Lord of Waterdeep does

she have anything to do with the

harbor's unclear damn it

right so then why would you want to

interrupt our friend gnarl here from

saying that he works for the brigand

earth because the less you know about

break and death the better for you I

mean their insidious and dangerous and

their covert and they don't like to be

exposed that I don't want to bring that

wrath upon you you don't want that oh

right okay I'm just gonna say right now

though we probably have it on accident

just like everything else in our

pathetic lives so maybe it's already too

late

he says and I know since you know about

breagan death now that its leader is not

to be trifled with her right I got you

so we don't want to mess with the

brigand Darth right and we don't want to

interrupt your boss would you say almond

Ron you're talking through the doors now

yeah

oh man Jon know right yes sorry who

was it he says I'm with the Harper's and

we do we are here to protect the city of

Waterdeep on behalf of lady lateral

silver hand the open Lord of Waterdeep

well this is all happening Strix is

getting closer to the grilled me like

you go over to the growl make a charisma

persuasion check six okay yeah as you

make your way over the growl just sort

of wraps you up in its bar bed tendrils

or tries to oh it rolled a nineteen on

the dice that's a twenty three to hit

wraps you up pulls you off your feet and

deals eleven points of piercing damage

to you as the barbs on its tentacles

pierce your flesh I need you to make it

Constitution saving throw in the middle

this conversation just happy you get a

bonus of +5 for evylyn okay he one comes

over like no bad ground no okay

so Strix immediately goes limp as she's

paralyzed so she can't talk or do

anything she just goes limp in its

clutches and then at that point it

begins knowing on her with its beak and

so Strix you take another Strix you take

another seven points of piercing damage

let's roll let's roll initiative okay

this is because the gazer was a little

guy was friendly that all the creatures

were gonna be friendly now this entire

conversation was happening in the

foreground of the camera yes around you

to see your body

23:23 4df 2222 not not that it matters

what I got nineteen it will matter

because you'll get another savings room

okay for all right DF you notice in the

background of this conversation Strix

now limp in the class

of the Grell yeah at the moment like she

does does like an interrupted shriek

maybe she's just like god damn it

and look pull out a sword and like just

leap for the grill and just make an

attack okay I guess try to go towards

it's like fleshy beak area and away from

Strix sure boy yeah 18 that's it okay

good

she's paralyzed those I don't know if I

will count sneak attack damage I know

yeah for nine damage okay so you stab at

this thing and some goop spills out of

its bulbous brain like head yeah I want

to like try to at least do not damage

and get it to being enough pay and that

loses and loosens its grip on stress it

actually does the contrary a tightens

its grip on her almost reflexively and

so if you're done we jump to palton

palton you see Strix now entwined in the

ten barber tentacles of this floating

brain monster Paul who sees that and

he's just like now she's gonna die no

I'm gonna be able to his watching the

knighting is gonna help that's gonna

help I can never help and then egg on

the ground just kind of alright

then the Grell goes and let's see you

are currently grappled by it so did it

has advantage on attack rolls to hit you

so it will continue to tighten its grip

on you you take another seven piercing

damage from the tentacles okay and you

take uh let's see another six points of

damage from the beak okay I don't

remember if I took any damage last

episode I don't think he shot the death

ray at you and missed yeah okay okay

okay cool some okay stone yeah I was

checking cuz I'm on my other computer

I'm very good my heat wasn't

all right and then Strix you get to make

a new saving throw at the end of your

turn it's a constitution save your +5

for evil in I'm sorry I'm so stupid

24 you are no longer paralyzed okay I

wake up and I my hand outstretched for a

scritching and that's the end of your

turn

next up is Naru and says I think this is

my cue to leave and he will try to slip

out the door thanks a lot for your help

he will have to move past paltin will

paltin allow him to move past let me

think about it

Megan ankle tipped over egg um I think I

hold wrist I will resume as I was all

right thorvin will restrain himself and

not attack Norrell as he goes past evil

and they're gonna let the drow step away

yeah am I supposed to let him slip away

okay guess yes not that important bye

yeah let me go we made a promise evylyn

will stab the girl oh and this is just

to decide opportunity attacks against

the drought so evil Evelyn's way down on

four we're not quite there yet

fine all right so you're gonna let the

drought go past yeah hi thanks for

nothing but have a nice day Warrington

says thank you for the book good luck at

your future endeavors and off he goes

Warrington will then move into the room

and proceed to punch the growl in the

face nice alright he hits the growl I'll

just give him average damage boom the

growl and Strix sort of go flying back a

few feet

as Warrington delivers a mighty punch

and then it is thorvin stern thorvin

will walk up and wallop the grout grout

critic it with his wrench damn right

another whack on the growl the Grell is

now bloodied and it is evil UNS turn

it's almost as though even remembers

that she has one hit point but there's

some reason she's like so weird like you

know just something that occurred to me

too man really weird particular yeah

yeah uh but Evelyn is going to flame

sword into the grill all right 24 it and

that's gonna be nineteen damage holy

smokes

right and you're a second attack oh yeah

ooh 27 oh yes oh man come on

oh my gosh that's three ones out of four

so eleven damage alright it is still

clinging to life at this point the

little albino gazer will take will take

a little naanum good yeah I think he'll

fire a frost ray at the growl which has

to make a saving through this is like

you got it buddy

alright growl rolled a 9 on his deck

save so he is gonna take some damage and

if I take average damage that kills the

growl little pew boss right the grill

dies and then Strix you find yourself

kind of as the growl flops down on the

ground and you with it

you're just kind of draped in its dead

squishy tentacles

okay I'm just facedown on the ground

looking sad

I just don't bother to get up okay and

we are out of initiative evylyn goes

over and lay his hands on Strix it's

like are you okay oh my body is okay

what my spirit is broken

well Jett I have just the thing ready

spirit healing no it's fine

she does it she lays her hands on her

face anyway hmm well it's my face stop

tell me how heard are you I'm not to

hurt also just for some added context

this whole time paltin is still like

covered in blood just just saying yeah

I'm 43 out of 68 okay so you're she

gives you 10 okay

thanks a little little spirit healing

give 268 hit points huh okay and then I

did not know that palton was bloody

which would have been one of the reasons

that she would oh yeah he's been at like

three hit points yep she's gonna then be

like like they're there how many gonna

give them she'll give him like how many

total do I have right now love lays on

hug okay she'll give him like

a35 okay 38 yeah he'll tap herself on

the head and give herself a few better

laugh strikes can also heal evil in as

well she'll heal her how much no you

don't have one hip wink so it's kind of

a mess I don't have one I have I have a

couple more than one couple more okay

one was healing herself because

everyone's like worried about her she's

like I healed myself okay I will do a

fourth level cure would so it's for D

eight plus four so give me one second

okay

while you're healing so you're kind of

in now Gnarls office which is a square

room about 15 feet in diameter dark no

light but those of you who can see in

the dark can see two open crates against

one wall a stone desk in a corner that

seems to be free of papers but it has

two drawers hmm

and there's a chair behind it carved

with a spider motif and then there are a

couple bare bookshelves against an east

wall there's also of course the open

secret door all right I want to check

out this desk those of you can see in

the dark try to go in too and see if you

can retrieve someone that smoke powder

or if you can't see make some light but

it's not fire how are you seeing by the

way just that guess these I know Astrix

you can have a create light with your

staff right with a lantern yeah I make

light with my lantern I just cast a

first-level healing so you only get six

hip points oh here you go thanks oh

right now right now it's tricks is green

light lantern that's sort of

illuminating the room and as you sort of

sort things out and death you go over to

the desk NarL returns he comes into the

room and he's just like got his hands up

he's like I'm so sorry this

this is so awkward but I left without my

spell book it's gone and so he makes his

way over to the desk and sort of tries

to nudge you out of the way yeah what

don't know don't mind me looks at Strix

like what you will beget tonight what

can I try a polymorph him sure if you

like okay I'm just gonna nonchalantly be

like wow I need gotta make a saving

throw right yeah

sixteen oh yeah and this is wisdom yeah

cuz he said spell book and he's evil and

searches like whoa all right hero the

fifteen so what are you turning him into

this is a spider he likes spiders right

yeah he's hurt he turns into a spider

yeah down on the floor oh that happened

my hand slipped

I'm so sorry gnarl I'm sorry actually

yeah yeah yeah yeah he's he's a spider

take the spell book what I'm not gonna

steal a stealth spell book when you over

to the Destiny earth you see that it's

two drawers are locked they seem to have

a there's like a master lock above the

drawers themselves that seems to be

holding them shut okay I opened them you

just sort of like flick one with your

finger and somehow I yeah okay so go

ahead and make your dexterity saving

throw or dexterity uh roll you got it

that's a 32 okay then yeah you you open

that like it's nothing and the first

drawer contains what appears to be a

spell book it is a sturdy tome bound in

black leather and wrapped in webbing the

second drawer contains what appears to

be a folded up bag

but the bag is empty alright and it's

like a it's like a satchel

it's got like a arm strap on it and it's

but it's all just sort of hold it up and

scrunched up inside the compartment

do I smell magic yeah there's a faint

whiff of magic deaath we'll take the

spell book and hand it to Strix anybody

I make sure everything in there is as he

says there's no other information that

we could possibly use or if there's

neither or whatever you can learn from

it I don't know how you work when you

look at the bag you see it's it is a

fancy satchel and sewn into its lid is a

design that almost looks like a smiling

face like an emoji kinda I would think

anyway does it look like this satchel

could potentially hold a small barrel of

say smoke powder or we can play smoke

powder into it when you sort of open the

flap and look into the bag it doesn't

seem particularly deep it's like a purse

basically but it'll are a larger one but

as you kind of reach around inside it

seems to have more depth inside than the

outside would suggest this is in mine

it's like idea if I closed the drawer

for a moment it's like opens back up and

looks at the bag Strix is like what he's

evil well even this is this is the Zanna

thar's right you you look at it you look

at the bag make a perception check it's

like chirpy it says his nickname looting

stealing looting stealing perception

yeah really good twenty-eight sewn into

the inside flap are the initials JB JB

yeah

GF Boudreaux well was it his no there's

nothing else this is actually probably

an important clue I'm gonna hold on to

this so it looks like it was handwritten

no it's it's stitched in and stitched in

beautiful sort of platinum thread like

like a beautiful monogram right okay

yeah I'm gonna take it for nothing else

that that seems you know that can

important information I'm want to hold

onto that okay

so I'll be just borrowing it also look

through the spell book just see if

there's anything out of the ordinary

it's also a sensational fashion

accessory I'm just saying Gucci yard and

yes you can find its picture on page 153

of the Dungeon Master's guide and you're

living at the yo get the spell book and

the arcane spells written in them are

clearly meant for Wizards eyes only that

always makes me so mad yeah Strix just

looks at it she's like I already know

everything in here and she puts it on

the de-escalate a little too hard and

soul say he'll turn into it he'll turn

back into a drought an hour of be fine

you hear warnings and you by the light

of the Thunder what do we end yeah yeah

he's shining you're your lantern light

Strix into the secret room by Jove I

think we found it by Lysander you mean

right excellent as you gaze into the

secret room you see a pyramidal stack of

twenty kegs and written on them in

common and elvish probably are the words

smoke powder do not open

that's what it says captain pointing at

it he goes over and lifts the top one

off this sort of looks at its full well

was he want to change that part well I

was going to use this too and for my

photo weapon I was going to have crafted

oh yeah firearms yes exactly firearms

thorvin says perhaps so we should use it

to destroy this place all of it

nonsense yeah why did how much gun the

gun smoke powder do you need let's see

this

I dare not open it but it's awfully full

these must be handled with care you know

you can't just shake them around if I

did this whole trove would just blow up

and we'd all be dead and then Pippin

would be right 1 kg Shh what a single

keg be enough for you or a single cake

an old roughly 500 shots worth of

ammunition

so quite sufficient I would say shots

like what Paulson usually takes no no no

shots that basically shots from a

firearm so what happens is you have a

fire on you'll put the ammunition inside

with the smoke powder there's no powder

propels the ammunition through the air

great velocity through your opponent or

whatever else you're shooting at stuff

inside an arm it's not like that an idea

a firearm is like a wand and effect

think of it as an extra device that you

have to carry around in your hand and it

fires projectiles they're cold

boy cool balls usually can I have one

I'm sure we can have one whipped up yeah

though rather loud cracking you might

say I'm kind of loud to know more

drawers in the desk could I give through

all of it you there are two drawers and

you've opened them both okay cool

my spell book is back and chill just let

I put it on the floor next to the spider

and be like here

Florida thorvin says that he being the

engineer has studied the sauna thar's

layer and has pinpointed areas of

weakness where were the smoke powder

placed in those locations would cause a

collapse of the entire dungeon fantastic

we could probably take out the entire

Zenith our existence in one fell swoop

at the same time this won't damage the

instructional integrity of the sewers or

the rest of a city or anything no we are

far enough down that it wouldn't be a

problem for that and you're certain of

that yes absolutely and he says so we'll

need to plan to widen it the threshold

of the secret door at the top of the

stone buttresses and near the arena at

the base of the pillars in the main hall

against the back wall of the zenith

house of the Senators abode between

other columns in the kitchen anywhere in

the crypts but basically we could

probably do the work with one two three

we could save maybe three of these cakes

for other uses only three awesome so

then after we set those up how do we do

we light the fuse and then we get out

you light a fuse do you ever way of

doing that and the supplies to do so yes

sir I could get those from my quarters

up perfect if we can take up the entire

Zenith our organization right here and

now this would just would keep the kids

safe it would keep the rest of us say if

there's not coming after us and so many

people in Waterdeep would be safe

thorvin also says there is a tendency

there are there'd be holders to come and

take up the mantle of Zenda thar he was

not the first and he won't be the last

mr. holder proof the whole place unless

we behold their proof the place by

bringing it all down exactly could take

it all out Amerigo want to like that he

will try to stop us

Amerigo listen to me for I am the zenith

our he's not here yeah I mean canopy

holder come and take the place if death

is already buzzing apart oh wait for me

hold a condom wants the janitor I can go

get him when I go get the fuses well

let's not worry about him for now though

if we if he happens to bump into us

we'll handle it then warranted yes

take as many kegs as you can carry he's

already got like three under his arms

three under one arm and one under the

other I'm good

excellent blend

you're pretty strong Keep Calm go get

bring some other kegs up for us look

start getting these into place I can but

I have to carry palton to here good on

top of one of these pots and she sets of

light bounces of Warrington Warrington

sort of very gently sets his barrels

down and walks over to pip in and says

Damon I've had enough of your stuff it's

time to get up off your ass and get into

gear I need you to help us blow this

place to smithereens can you do it it's

gonna be cool tollens just like

Warrington will kneel right down to you

face to face and say Paulton we're

counting on you she goes why I just

someone else will die I'll let somebody

else down again and again and again the

only wood had to go from down is up he

kind of stands up very very like weakly

there's like no confidence in his

posture just like all right whatever

what do you need Dingaan Thorburn those

are three locations that we can set up

these keg potters and once we get these

set up and walking with the proper fuse

we can blow this place I don't know how

fast the powers returned to replace

others anethe ours but we need to do

this as fast as possible so we can get

out of here once we're out of here we're

gonna be safe all of us are gonna be

safe jinx gravely NAT they're going to

be safe

Simon's going to be safe we just need to

do this and be done with it all go with

thorvin check those spots get success

boat putter setup and I know if you try

to do anything wrong I know you could

handle it all right Alton we can do it

together I'll carry the stuff and you

show me where to put it

thorvin will return with the fuse ropes

and all of the other stuff the the ropes

have been treated so they will be they

will burn rather nicely he can cut you

can set them to various lengths so that

the end time things so that they more or

less go off at the same time and give

you as much time as you think you need

to get out which he estimates is at

least 5 minutes Oh plenty also say I can

you know magic us out to at least even

better ice yep even better yeah you can

take up to how many people oh gosh let

me check

five willing creatures within 5 feet of

you okay great

so that's all of us the in little

beholder floats as close to you as

possible and kind of like bumps up

against you to make sure you don't

forget about oh I'm just like oh my gosh

I'll be over Gary Oz and it's getting

annoying at this point like everyone

likes Turks is are like the worst like

cute animal squish mode with this name

I'm including that creature that appears

to be six of us Warrington you know

smoke powder better than anyone you

should be the one to get out of here

faster as it running

well Thor but you can get everything set

up but then after everything's set up

all we need to do is thorvin says he

knows they made it the complex well

enough that he can get out without your

help magically right so and all you need

us to do is what set it on fire just

like the fuses and get out and it's as

simple as that

that's all there is to it I'll make sure

that nobody else is around to tamper

with anything any taps is his big wrench

is it still is the drow still a spider

is okay but he's in here somewhere

he's on the brat crawling around

crawling up the chair oh okay um all

right I will I was when we're about to

leave I'm gonna dispel that so he can

get out okay I don't want to just murder

him yeah thorvin will say no Nora will

probably with everything we should

leave him behind it all right we'll do

that

drought or not to be trust in their

their treacherous creatures that I mean

I feel like that's kind of racist so

let's just not all right well well if

thorvin set everything up

and then I want thorvin to get out of

here as fast as possible we'll light the

fears and then we're out of here in an

instant thanks districts

Darvin says this will go more quickly if

we break into teams of two hmm

uh-huh and then we can meet up in a

place to a central place after we've

placed our our kegs and said yeah that

that make sense to me there's three

spots and six of us so yeah six of us so

well break off a team to to set up the

kegs set up the fuses and it'll be good

we can do it very fast yes I've already

taken the liberty of taking out the

Panoptix surveillance system oh good

that sounds good good also my the magic

spell is me and five dwelling creatures

so it's technically six yes you DF

palton evylyn Warrington and a little

yes a little yeah yes and is there and

then thorvin potentially and I guess

yeah the organ can get out I think so

Evan can get out on its own so you don't

need him okay so yeah so we get everyone

cool okay as far as you know you're not

leaving anybody else behind so all right

well then let's split up and handle this

paltin evylyn you take one of locations

strict you can go with Warrington and

I'll go or thorvin all right okay come

on paulten you're ready to help huh then

we'll make a albeit a few spot or

thorvin we'll set up after like connects

them all wherever that'll be hope we

meet there in just a few minutes how

long will this take to set up like five

minutes maybe yeah five minutes and

thorvin has given you is basically he'll

he'll put the he'll thread the fuses

into the kegs and chop them at the right

length so that by the time you get there

you light them you should be good you

just light them and go got it all right

so we'll meet back up at five minutes

and then I mean get out of here okay

okay

all right so which team wants to place

their charges

in the arena Warrington says I know the

way the Strix person Strix look like a

looks at just like cause like and then

just what like walks with him into the

end of the arena but she'll also shout

like whisper something to her a little

gazer friend and it'll float over next

to dias ah oh all right I do yeah

thorvin right yes so you thorvin will

have a lantern with you so that you can

see Oh grace you're as you're carting

barrels to the XANA thar's layer and

then the other place that he recommends

you place the charges is in the what can

we say that that that dent time somebody

in the main in the main hall lair you

want to go there's an throws lair and

said okay yeah I'll blow that up

alright so Evelyn and paltin you make

your way to the zenith arse layer and

thorvin and DF you're in the main

hallway setting

casks up against pillars got it okay so

you're in a way you're kind of between

the other two groups which is nice okay

good all right

Evelyn's carrying the powder and she's

like come on paulten you can like the

way you have that Sun sword it makes

light right

you can light our way go go go you do

need light oh yeah today would that not

ignite it that seems really dangerous

only if you were to bring it into

contact with one of the barrels it has

no concept of how that works so she

doesn't know if I just have already just

like berry fire something that wouldn't

act that wouldn't ignite it that's just

like glowing right right it's a fixed

effect though so it doesn't move with

you oh well all right I'll just be I

guess be very careful yeah essentially

you've got evylyn you've got the barrels

just sort of tied to rope so you're just

kind of dragging them on the floor

behind you maybe even carrying one under

your arm as you do little girl big

strength yep yeah cuz you're each moving

about four barrels four or five barrels

so and with palton leading the way with

this sword crackling you make your way

back to the sound of cars lair where you

see there is a big empty fishbowl among

other things what happened there where's

the fish yeah yeah you don't see

anything you don't see any sign of the

fish mmm you start to plant the casks

and kegs around and paltin as you watch

evil and move kegs into place you hear a

voice behind you say hey hi have you

seen a fish I don't what did you do with

the fish hello are you are you dwarf

this door the skinny little dwarf comes

up to you and he's got a beanie on

that's got a little beholder eye stalks

sewn into the teeth hey I'm at steel

toes and I'm the fish keeper but I don't

know where the fish went so

know what to do next I turn to him I'm

just like fish is fine

you should leave I'm gonna persuade him

[Laughter]

that's an 18 okay Wow

you really are something people seem to

really want to do whatever you say I'm

just like yeah what were we doing

even still gunpowder around this room

but apparently this guy didn't notice

like you see you seem real off still

dude do you need a talk saying this it's

nothing to talk about

I'm just everyone around me just dies

and that's that's what I get for some

reason so why do you think that we're

not dead just like he's dead I wasn't

there I wasn't I should have been there

she's dead

she's just dead I'm not dead guy died

just he's still like really shook just

like this mindless slant rambling and

like eyes are still glossed over like

he's barely finding strength to even

like walk around to do this I think it

was mainly because he just wanted a

hippo to stop yelling at him I mean

don't we all know knocked over their

sticks over here to the left closer to

the buttress will you come on now stop

dragging your heels is a serious work

this has to go off right we only get one

chance

oh please okay right I'll come over

there hold on I got this one set sorry

there's heavier great old yeah I think

it's perfect what do you think should we

like the views now I say we like to fuse

them you know all right use your magical

what are we sure magic won't just like

make it worse

just like the fuse don't light the kegs

the fuse maybe should stand all they

have turn this way

what does everyone know we're lighting

the fuse that was the instructions yeah

got like five minutes before they all

blow okay all right all right now just

like I'll just shoot a little fire bolt

on the fuse like well right your fuses

light and they just start to slowly

crackle away getting shorter and shorter

with each passing second but not in any

you know it's not like you're in

imminent danger and he says well we

should leave with over an imminent

danger to get everyone together before

he can cast the spell so let's uh go

find everyone yes oh whoa

and death you're there you've the kegs

are set thorvin has basically taken

opened up the door on his lantern so

they can use the flame inside to light

the fuses the little albino beholder is

just sort of drooling next to you cute

[Laughter]

with anticipation yeah and he thorvin

lights the fuses and then Warrington and

Strix show up excellent all right

thorvin bringing ourselves out of here

in an instant thanks this tricks is

magic and you could find yourself safely

out of here quickly yes sir I will take

the way out through skull part time

perfect that sounds like you should get

going good luck

you two thorvin and he he stomps off

evylyn and palton evylyn you're pretty

sure you put them exactly according to

where Thor even asked you to near the

weakest wall structures in the Zanna

thar's lair and you see palton is still

ambling around his sword

lit but sort of sagging in his hand as

he paces about explain to me that I was

supposed to light these yes yeah and you

can use the sword do you want to use

your sword to light the fuse that'll be

fun

as unenthusiastically as you can picture

he just kind of like like just kind of

like he can't even really move darm he

has to like just kind of turn his whole

body just kind of and so the fuse is lit

and as you turn to leave you see Amer go

standing in the doorway blocking your

exit this horned helmet down and he says

what have you done what are you doing

well blocking blocking us yeah

blocking your way out I think you should

probably leave this makes a mare called

Matt Wells I have this is my maze this

is my lair anothers Anitha will be

coming soon we must get it ready this is

how it's always been

except that that may no longer be the

reality in which you live America cannot

accept okay well I'm just kind of like

likes is just slowly like walking up

like he said he's not like like there's

the the sort of the Sun stored still in

ham but it's not like up he's just like

walking it's like dragging behind him

just like a like just leaving a shard

mark he just like walks up to the guy he

just goes move and then whatever that

would be I don't know it seems like an

intimidating persuasion I think it's

intimidating

all right all right okay uh twenty four

okay he stares at you from underneath

the thick armored brow of his helmet and

his horns twenty-four

that's good and he he will back away and

create an open doorway for you so okay

let's go how people just real you know

maybe you're just such a good leader

people just really listen to you you

conversation as you're kind of walking

out trying to be really encouraging like

don't you feel good about that you know

miss make a even make a perception check

[Applause]

sixteen Amerigo goes into the room after

you pass through him

evylyn and you sort of take one last

passing glance and he's going over to

the fuse and he's got his great acts up

as if to and that's what he does Ellen

he cuts the fuse Paulding can you can

you explain to him why he can't do that

well I go relight it I'm like goes over

to him it's just like why'd you do that

I don't want to get blowed up

there's this boat so why don't you just

leave and go where I don't know

not here like cuz I don't know if

somebody we're trying to blow up your

home would you not try to stop it oh you

can come live in our home is it amazing

no I mean depending on how you define me

is I suppose our kind live in mazes well

we can make you a little maze we don't

wanna make you homeless make a

persuasion check

 dwarf lives at our mansion one

wait 21 is it is it a big maze like a

like good-sized maze I mean you'd have

to design it we could we could you know

I could make my own maze yeah your own

it's connected to a sewer to sewers are

kind of like mazes maybe you can wander

around in there as they're talking I

just like walk back over it now come on

she grabs both of their hands and she's

like come on yeah you see yeah he sort

of kind of drags his heels a little bit

but you do mention a pole this big

armored dwarf along and he sort of looks

back at the fuse getting shorter and

shorter with his big horned helmet and

he looks back and he keeps talking about

the maze so yeah sewers really like a

maze you can just wander around in there

I could put in more secret doors right

secret door traps yeah that's right

okay this sounds like a plan and this

and and Zanna thar lives there too you

know a manner of speaking yes actually

she's just finally evylyn palton and a

mare go ah damn it Richard okay so

that's too many I'm sorry

two men oh uh Amerigo how about you um

if she could give them directions to

their house and she's like just run

along up there and meet us up at the

house make another persuasion check

more important ways for you to guard us

lair that only we know about and we need

you to protect it and that's deep within

the sewers of Waterdeep America you'll

need to be within those sewers and

making sure that no one else can come at

to our Manor and once you learn the

sewers you little to rebuild it reshape

it however you want to make sure no one

else can get through that way No no

at him that's fine I mean you can play a

trumpet blare through it just you know

yeah yeah if he says long as an affair

I'll like play it so it's like like like

back Oh

by God every good could get out here now

yes let's go wait stop Strix here it's

not a still a spider or I can make him

not a spider yeah we need to give him an

opportunity to leave what about if you

just put him in a little bottle on your

belt and then we can just take him with

us

I can't but still counts as another

creature

I will dispel his polymorph and just

know how figured out he's not dumb yeah

okay so he appears surprised yeah

and that was like I'm saying you have

about 60 seconds to make it do rain to

the surface or though you're gonna blow

up with the rest of this place

get out here while you can but my

spellbook just take it oh you're not

there Oh spell book is back in this

office no way he was in the office the

spider was oh you're gonna go back and

get him okay um no cuz he I figured he

was still there I don't think he

followed me okay oh yeah I think

spider-man the office and yes if he's in

an office more like off in a different

location then I guess I don't talk to

him at all yeah okay so you gonna leave

him yeah alright uh I mean he heard the

whole plan he knows it get out of there

yeah alright and then Strix yes I cast

the spell and you tube out take us all

back to the chamber no your sanctuary in

the Waffle House a panic room yes okay

so you all disappear out of the Santa

Thoris lair you appear in the panic room

of the Waffle House yay home sweet home

don't we all here yes

first things first Strix go look for

waffles Eve let's check on the kids

Moulton look for Simon make sure they're

all okay okay you hear lots of hammering

everywhere around you the sound of

hammers against wood nails being driven

in it's loud is is squiggly hammering

again squiggly

running off to look for the kids okay as

soon as you start to start sort of run

around the place you can see that there

are work crews all over oh no I don't

have money and you can also see that

scaffolding has been erected around the

the turret and there's some business

going on as that top of the turret is

being repaired yeah did you hire crews

to do our Renault without telling us no

did you hire crews to renovate our house

without telling me no I guess God's side

and try to discern what the heck who

sent these people maybe ask them sure

you can see that the the foremen who are

sort of coordinating these endeavors are

talking to an old dwarf woman in a

wizard's robe standing out front and

looking at pagers and signing off on

contracts and whatnot and you recognize

you recognize her as magic lady I'll

quarry a stone marrow the old dwarf

woman seems to be behind all this and

she says don't trouble yourself all has

been taken care of it's part of my

investment to get this place in top

shape you have a store to open don't you

think about that we do have a store to

open all other business will be taken

care of

great no pain no expense part of the

investment ever since just coming up

sunshine she says and of course you'll

need magical protections yay have you

seen three children and al bear and a

construct they're at the

Paul could you go get them back from the

neighbors you know the best do you want

one of us to go with you he's still lost

just I don't think maybe paltin should

talk to our neighbors right now okay why

don't you go talk to them okay Walton

you just you go sit and strap on chair

of itch and you just take some deep

breaths okay just likes curls up right

where he is mr. X can you try to fix him

what no I I can I mean do you want me to

make him up hi that's all I can do maybe

is there a safe place where I could put

these highly volatile kegs of Smith

powder go god I thought you don't you

have somewhere to stay Warrington you

can stay here avoid capital I shall

venture forth then he goes off with his

kegs to find our guest room or goes off

like great I just I top a little gazer

I'm just like you can live wherever you

want but I suggest you live here because

it's most magic okay you go scouting

around looking for a place to live house

turrets

yeah he'll check the place out evylyn

you're gonna go across the street mm-hmm

okay

you see you see an elf who runs an

herbalist shop she's got a greenhouse up

on the third floor encased in glass and

she comes to the door when you knock and

you can hear the kids inside arguing

with each other

greetings in the light of the morning

Lord levander hello

they were your you'll be pleased to hear

that they were fine I just set them to

chores oh they did yours that's so nice

did they do them you hear stampeding

down the steps and they come and they

just basically grab on to you

all three of them and they're overjoyed

they call it your name there they are so

delighted to see you and that gives you

a quick sign like us out of here oh yeah

yeah yeah that was braunfels yeah

where's the al bear the al bear will

come galumphing down is he okay well

thank you so much you know if there's

ever anything neighborly we can do to

return the favor we just really

appreciate you keeping them safe and

entertained oh there's always work to do

bring them over anytime okay

I'm sure they'll love that it seems like

they had a great time yeah so gnats

squidly and Jenks while you were staying

in follows company you found them to be

good hosts but they she didn't accept

any nonsense and so she had you

basically tending tending her gardens

watering and all that kind of business

and she kept you just busy busy busy

elves don't sleep you've discovered so

yeah you're you're kind of you're kind

of tired out all the kids are tuckered

yes you look kind of just like maybe one

of them like maybe Jenks is like on her

hip like she'll carry him you know super

tired Jenks is dragging he just looks

[Laughter]

exhausted the other thing that the three

of you noticed is that fala has a

roommate or somebody who lives with her

he lives typically up on the roof but

you saw him coming and going in the

strangest of fashions usually leaping

across rooftops and it's a big scary

half work and I've seen you leaping

across rooftops and stuff you know he's

not actually there oh the kids are

telling you about him

oh that they met him on several

occasions cuz he has

staying there but squidly was a little

bit suspicious of him because he seemed

to be watching the Waffle House a lot Oh

No

are you sure Squidling he was pretty

sure that does seem kind of odd but

squits Quigley

you were taken by this half works Bo

because his bow is ginormous it's about

it's about seven feet tall

it fires arrows the size of javelins and

it looks like you have to be super super

strong to pull that string at one point

you actually snuck in and with you

pulled the string and it was so tight

you could hardly even move it it's gonna

be mine yes and like as he just like

when he failed to do it he lets go he's

like that's so cool yeah did you catch

his name's Quigley did I yes his name is

Suraj the hunter Suraj the hunter he

does sound real cool it's really cool

I'm gonna have to tell death all about

how cool he is and also how scary it is

that he's watching our house yes he's
