[Music]

ah hello and welcome to dice camera

action

yay this week we got a guest star mr.

Jeff Robinson thank you very much sir

thanks for having me it's gonna be fun

yeah attractive

[Laughter]

so last week the waffle crew had their

second visit from the night hags and on

this particular visit Strix paltin MDF

all had this time the great time yes

these spectral hags jamming what felt

like pillowcases down their throats

these black sacks and evylyn you were

awakened to the sound of your companions

gagging in the night but couldn't see

what they were gagging on but you do

smell the sort of drying out an odor of

Strix a--'s pastries and as you watch

those pastries you see evylyn forms

materialized out of nowhere at first

they kind of look ghostly and spectral

and they're just sort of wavering a bit

but then they solidify and you see three

hags with midnight

blackish blue skin in the dark room that

you're in materialized and just start

reaching out for the pies do I know no I

don't know these were made for hags so

so and you're kind of like propped up

and

corner like a doll this sort of what and

they you don't get the impression that

they've they treat you as a living

creature that you're just something that

the party has been carrying around but

as soon as you say that they immediate

as they're reaching for the pies

greedily they all turn to face you and

you can see one of them has a bag over

its head and what looks like a terrier

head poking out through a hole in it

another one has what looks like coins

covering her eyes and the third one it's

a little hard to tell but she's got

something crawling all over her skin

maybe like ants

so I yell at them oh no you don't but

then I remember that when we were on the

boat we talked about hags coming to help

us actually yes so I'm like oh oh sure

yeah just a second and then I go try to

administer to my friends who I think are

choking but I have my like or of

protection and everything so I'm just

kind of like trying to yank whatever's

in their throats out of their throats

and there's nothing there and as soon as

you sort of climb on top of them they

start to wake up because they can feel

you climbing on top of them and they

stop gagging at that point and as you're

doing that you see the hags snatch up

the pastries and one of them bites into

it while the other two just sort of

watch her eye I'm like strikes is it

okay if our new hag friends have some of

your pie wake up what was that part of

alright yes it's one with the pike don't

wake me up I'm asleep don't I want to

see them yeah you see that once the hag

who been into the pie finds what looks

like a long piece of hair and she just

sort of pulls it out and tucks it away

and then she scarfs down the rest of the

pie I'm still asleep her eyes Strix you

can see as she prized one of your eyes

open off in the corner in the dark

corner where you left the pies are these

three shape

these dark horned figures with their

backs to you and can you hear their lips

smacking as one by one they start to

scarf down the buys don't be embarrassed

they like it you're a great Baker

it's supposed to make up so hopefully

they don't come back again like maybe

the pies will like not have them choke

us like I just I was choking her eyes

are still closed there's enough noise

now that you wake up we've never seen

these hags before what are you talking

about are you having a weird dream

stop talking close so yes when you wake

up you can actually see the three hags

huddled in the corner eating the pies

it's hard to make out what they are at

first but once your eyes adjust a little

bit to the moonlight coming in through

the window you do see that they are

clearly these horned dark-skinned black

haired female demonic Crone's

[Laughter]

all right then the hags finish off the

pies they lick their fingers they seem

quite content and then you see them sort

of shift out of your reality become

ghostly once again and then as they make

their way toward the door their ghosts

just sort of fade away and they just

kind of pass right through the door you

want to say hi okay good night were they

supposed to help us with with halogen

the pies were just to make it less bad

paltin you hear your name and you sort

of wake up huh what there's Paulson's

the thing you know is it fixed yet I

like I like wake up after that I'm just

like who's got a smoke anyone else have

a great night yeah the hags weren't

particularly clean they left crumbs of

the pies everywhere on the floor and

stuff but they're gone well immediately

prestidigitation those away

all right none of that at least I mean

the whole point of Strix baking the pies

was to maybe just like satiate them for

a moment so that if they do come back

and whatever they're doing is not as

brutal all right whatever okay she knows

she can't fight them there's no way to

fight these things so it's hard this is

our you come up I you don't have any

more distressing encounters through the

rest of the night and you still have

some sleep to get before you wake up

refresh to the next morning but when you

do wake up the next morning and you go

downstairs for the usual buffet that has

been arranged on the ground floor of

kaya's house of repose as you trundle

down the steps brushing the sleepies out

of your eyes and yawning and probably

not in Yvonne's case she's totally

finally but you see that a couple one of

the servants of how the the matron of

the house of repose is having an

argument downstairs in the doorway with

a a tall burly female half work and

standing in the half works shadow mojado

is a wretched little creature with

greenish yellow skin large pointed ears

sort of halfling sized but very kind of

monstrous and hideous and he's just sort

of birding me down with gear and packs

and pans and he's got like a small

little ladder and like some rope and a

bunch of other crazy crap it looks like

he's carrying not only his stuff but

hers as well and the what they're

arguing about seems to be well you hear

the the matron over the in say something

to the effect of we don't let talking

tomes into this establishment and half

works like he's my steward he's not a

toad he's a goblin that's racist did we

see this a half work earlier yeah this

day yeah talking to artists down here

weren't they like kind of in

volved they were having a involved

conversation yes and when the half-orc

sees you compiling down the stairs she

points and says we're with them at which

point the matron kind of looks at you

sees that you're paying customers

staying here and she just sort of rolls

her eyes and walks away

now Jeff what you see is coming down the

stairs is a wide-eyed puppet woman kind

of short but she's got all this gear

including an axe which looks like it was

partially made out of a tree of some

kind and behind her is a tall svelte

young man probably 1819 years old

dressed in leather armor who's he he

looks like his eyes are darting around

the room studying every detail as he

comes down even though he's probably

been down these stairs a half a dozen

times

looks like he's tuned to danger and then

behind him you see this witch with witch

hat and a broom and a little cloud of

flies that she's absently swiping at as

she talks and making her way toward the

food and then some time after them kind

of coming down the stairs with a wide

yawn is a another youngish man with

blond hair who looks like he could have

you he could easily have slept another

12 hours as they kind of descend and

income walking forward my eyes locked on

with the group and I put the orc between

us and them with just half my face kind

of peeking out behind her thigh and I

tap on her thigh which is a code that

I've worked out rigorously with her when

I'm uncomfortable okay doll and you know

I hate dolls and I fully put myself

behind her she when you do that she

turns to you and she says get used to it

they're our party now I deeply built but

then come out half way from behind her

thigh once more

okay do I see do I see him like duck

behind yeah you see this goblin creature

duck behind the burly half work say that

I kind of straight my back shift my you

know ridiculous amount of gear that I'm

carrying around kind of walk forward and

say my name is shamba but I only tell my

closest confidence my last name yeah

nice to meet you sure and I like throw

up a little bit cuz I'm still drunk all

right a little wad of spittle and barf

lands on the floor in front of you

prestidigitation that way I can be messy

but nothing else should be and then that

barf is just just whisked away by magic

you see some little sparkles of magic

come from the witch and it's gone I take

a look around for Dragon bait

uh no you can't see him downstairs do we

smell anything

I leaned over to Diaz and I'm like why

why do we have new party members again

why do we need them don't know but what

are they are they actually our party are

they just pretending to be our party and

we should be suspicious mm-hmm I mean

you're asking me always suspicious the

half work walks up to UDF Ritchie stands

about a foot taller than you yeah and

you can see that she has a holy symbol

around her neck which you can make a

religion check if you want intelligence

otherwise you've seen the symbol before

and Waterdeep quite a lot eleven that's

good enough you recognize it as the

symbol of Torme the god of strength oh

do I do I see this yeah you would see it

as well how do I feel about tor

as a servant of Lysander let me see if

they share any common domains for

starters all right she likes strength a

lot but I mean like so muscles if our if

our gods have any beef you know like I'm

not cool

but if our gods are chill then I'm cool

so Torme the god of courage strength and

self-sacrifice symbol is a white right

gauntlet there is not a lot of crossover

between the two faiths

Lysander is more about light life and

you know the hope of a new sunrise of a

new dawn Torme is more about the the

courage the embodiment of courage in

times of war and strife so it's much

more martial and focused and I'm like

I'm into Torme but like we're not

buddies or anything no okay you find you

find a lot of Tor mites tor mites huh

you find a lot of them are very very

eager to throw themselves into battle

which I would never do right

so on that level you can relate and she

introduces herself to you at umbral and

again she introduces chumba her steward

and says that she talked with artists

about accompanying you up the river so

ssin star

she says I'm part of an order called the

order of the gauntlet and we have a camp

of the river we'll follow you as far as

there no well why because the jungle is

dangerous and

having a priest like me around might

actually be advantageous also you just

want our protection that's fine of

course will protect you no problem we'll

protect much other how do you know

artists we'd met previously we hit it

off oh that's nice he's a good man he's

right me all right

contrary to the back to the rest of the

party we brought our own supplies and I

can also cast a spell that will summon

food and water

that sounds good so we can travel light

we have an album oh well that's not very

light she says well it can follow our

canoes like I guess I guess it can't

what if I make it small and reduce its

size you be careful with bottles do it

and then they can ride with us I mean

waffles would be really cute small but

you be careful she says I forgot to ask

artist which one of you is the party

leader that would be me anyone has any

questions please direct all of them I am

can I can I hit it with my broom when it

hurt yeah the random broom swipe in the

face I just immediately hit the floor

inserts all right

and she says which of you is our

navigator oh I mean by navigator with

who's guiding us I mean I'm gonna be

surviving it's kind of a democracy kind

of thing we just kind of weigh all of

each other's opinions I mean at the

moment we're supposed to be guided by it

Bagon babe I kind of tap umbral on the

thigh again say ask them which one is

the ventriloquist do I overhear that yes

are you talking about me little guy

that's real funny I'm even a Valona

he'll make Martha pleased to meet you

and I deeply kurtz you but it's like he

looks at you and says yes they asked of

course and he's looking around everyone

around you nice to meet you as well

I get back up I'm just like Oh idea

so we're Simon where's my son Simon you

have a new friend come Simon well he

sort of followed palton down the stairs

he'll trundle over and stand in front of

you chumba and this puppet is about

three feet tall dressed like a jester or

clown kind of freakish to you I suppose

with a big sort of jester hat on it's a

puppet it looks like a walking puppet

it's made of wood and cloth and leather

and it's painted with all kinds of

bright - dazzly clown colours and

usually walked over here yeah it just

just sort of and it's now standing in

front of you kind of looking up to

paltin then looking back at you his eyes

get really wide Simon this is your new

fringe a puddle of urine sort of forms

around the Goblin Kumbha right yeah yeah

it's okay

don't kill him okay don't kill him no

kill be good friends good friends the

puppet will extend its arms and come out

to you like to hug

did it just pee no yeah I'm saying you

peed oh wow you just realized it yeah I

just kind of back up okay it starts to

follow you okay it faces you through a

scene where you're just all looking

through the doorframe and you see the

goblin go by and then the go by and

then the Goblin go by and then the

puppet go by like do not lose that thing

again okay they'll be fine Kumba as you

are trying to stay keep your distance

away from the puppet and kind of looking

over your shoulder you hit something and

just make a dexterity saving throw for

me right that's you guys

it's just the d20 Oh a d20 yeah and just

add your dexterity bonus okay your

character here Oh oops

okay you're able to keep your feet as

you run into this creature and it looks

like a reptilian man in a cloak and

clothes his head has almost like a

dinosaur like shape to it and his skin

is green there is a sword in a loop

basically around his plain leather belt

and he's not much he's not a really big

creature dragon bait is only about five

feet tall or so wouldn't have talked to

me okay yeah but he's stocky and so when

you're hit him he's like oh he doesn't

move a bit but it stops you and then you

just sort of fall into the embrace of

Simon who hugs you this has been a very

traumatic experience so he surrendered

the oh if he's in the arms of Simon he

gives up he's just looking up at him

waiting for all right it's really become

excellent you smell ham

it seems to be coming from the creature

the the reptilian creature in front of

you okay

realizing that this insane devil doll is

not killing me I kind of give it a

reassuring squeeze of the shoulder area

okay now best friends and I kind of look

towards the lizard and say do you have

ham he shakes his head and then just

sort of walks past you to the door so

that the rest of you can see that dragon

bait has returned our guide is here I

follow I guess yeah he just nods and

then he looks at all of you doesn't say

anything but is standing outside in a

manner that suggests he's ready to go

whenever you are excellent if that's the

case we shouldn't dawdle here much

longer you've already caused enough

trouble in this town any trouble find us

yeah when does that not happen I still

think we shouldn't let him go we

probably won't have to worry about it

ever again

you're probably right all right so we're

we how are we gonna deal with waffles

there you let him run along the side

make waffles tiny turn waffles into a

cloud put waffles a bottle bottle so if

you want to reduce waffles

that's the enlarged reduced spell that

will last just so you know up to one

minute just gonna have to run alongside

okay

an umbrella says that canoes are waiting

for us to pick up on the way excellent

yeah you can guide us to the first camp

and then hopefully from there dragon

bait can guide us to where we need to go

well all she knows what she says all I

know is that

and the the camp is on the river so if

we follow the river we should be fine

but I'm not exactly sure how to get to

the river so hopefully he knows do you

know she says to dragon bait dragon bait

and he nods excellent all right and so

you follow dragon bait through the city

and the city is bustling as it was

yesterday you sort of cut through crowds

of people when you get to the market

umbrella makes a brief diversion gives a

small pouch to a man and then points to

two canoes that you guys now have to

carry two people two people can

basically carry a canoe over their heads

the canoes aren't that heavy

I love canoeing after last night did we

get the effects though full rest you do

yeah I hate to ask this but do we lose

any hip points from the curse so the one

who's missing the ring now is stress

right yeah so you lose one hit point

from the curse all right I thought we

dealt with that with the hex now we have

one more line I do

we've got one more yeah this is a strong

word as far as evylyn knows they just

had to come for a visit and they did and

they ate pie so everything they did eat

hi yeah all right so umbral leads you so

first of all who's gonna umbral can

certainly carry one end of one canoe and

dragon bait can carry the other end of

that canoe so there's one canoe taken

care of there is a second canoe that

needs two people to carry it I even know

Jarrod

Leland's already like trying to carry it

on her own she's like I love canoeing

look I can hold this there's nothing you

can't carry it in fact you're strong

enough to easily carry it it's awkward

however as you sort okay we'll direct

okay all right as you go through the

city streets and past crowds you

occasionally bump into people there's no

big deal

Umbro seems to be guiding you along

streets that hug the wall of the city

and the wall is on the other side of the

city from the harbor basically past the

wall are big trees hills mountains and

the wilderness but you sort of avoid the

heavy crowds by walking near the walls

and as you follow the wall along you

pass under some bridges and between some

buildings and through some neighborhoods

children run past and forth some back

and forth sometimes even under the

canoes as you're carrying them but you

finally get to one of the towering gates

of the city and it looks like a big

giant gate house with a portcullis on

the inside made of wood and big heavy

doors on the outside that are currently

open and the portcullis is currently

raised so there's no obstruction to

leaving at the top of the gate house

actually has trees growing on it like

it's flat on top and there must be a

garden up there and trees are sort of

sprouting from the top of it so it looks

very natural and beautiful and there are

all these painted murals of dinosaurs

and people on the surfaces of the gate

house so it's quite beautiful and

decorative but as you make your way

under the gatehouse and are now leaving

the city you see that there is another

small town outside right outside the

gates and it looks like it's built in

the remains of ancient ruins because the

two closest structures to you are these

giant ziggurats

and built on these ancient crumbling

ziggurats you can see bamboo shacks

on every tear it's like people have

taken over these ruins and kind of

turned it into a sort of bamboo ghetto

now connecting the two ziggurats over

the road is a narrow stone bridge that

looks like it was added later at some

point and dangling from that bridge or

what appeared to be carcasses and

they're absolutely covered with

thousands upon thousands of flies like

all the swarms of flies that would

normally be devouring the people out

here are feasting on these hanging

carcasses instead you know I thought it

was nice that Choate was so homey and

sweet but seeing corpses dangling really

just does remind me of burrow via and it

does bring back such nice memories

doesn't it only this place has been

cycling on like yeah they look like that

they were actually hung there probably

for the purpose of attracting flies Oh

like a it's like a primitive bug lamp

kind of interesting going on here can i

zoom up and check one out on my broom

yeah you can that draws some attention

from the crowds and crowds of people

that live among the ruins here as you

fly up yeah yeah you've got the whole

way to the canoe now I've owned so every

time you turn you're sort of spinning

the whole canoe is turning around and

just banging people in the back and in

the face yeah Strix when you fly up and

take a closer look you see most of the

carcasses look like dinosaurs or animals

or beasts of some kind underneath the

clouds of flies but you also see one of

them hanging from its feet appears to be

a goblin like you're a new frame down

there I don't really notice that though

right do I you can make a perception

check a wisdom perception check it's a

d20 role plus your wisdom perception

bonus which is actually minus one I

rolled a 15 so I got a fortunate okay

you do as Strix goes up in

the Flies start to kind of scatter

around her you see that one of the dead

carcasses is a goblin but you are not

close enough to see if you recognize it

okay and it looks like it's been eaten

away somewhat making it even harder to

discern its life for chumba so he kind

of looks at that and gives a firm nod it

just confirms his suspicions that

everyone's out together well strike so

just trying to find a weird bit to pull

off of something if she could find one

yeah you can essentially pull the the

sort of half fly evening claw off of

what looks like a Velociraptor sweet all

right okay all right I take that and

come back down probably come back with

like 20 more flies yeah a couple guards

on the gatehouse now above and behind

you shout down to you they're not seem

to be shouting down to anybody in

particular just to the whole group and

one of them says are you going for a

walk in the jungle watch out for terror

folks yeah thank you

wait what tier what are Terra folk and

he kind of laughs when you say that and

then his buddy who's with him says I'm

tree frogs watch out for the tree frogs

can do I kind of shot up to him what

fool wouldn't look out for tree frog the

tree fort don't touch me don't touch the

tree frogs yes I'm the dinosaurs okay

and the undead dinosaurs too

haha I'm dead dinosaurs cool that sounds

like a bad time

he looks like she's got this canoe but

it is so it's like a crow and she's like

I would really like some other

information

I want four of the last one I don't

think you can say one of them says and

beware of czar bows you beware the flu

bin flap and I think you made that

awfully dangerous see we can say funny

words too anyway they're they're

laughing and actually one of them seems

to be actually be drinking they're

making this we're fine yeah as you press

on and and Strix is sort of smitten with

her new find you continue your way

through this sort of outside shantytown

built among these ancient ruins and

carved in the middle of the Avenue ahead

of you almost the length of a football

field

is a trench surrounded by wooden fencing

and there's a bunch of people

congregated around this and chumba you

have been here before

this is executioner's run I kind of look

at the group knowingly and say yeah been

here before

they call this executioner's done that's

where they do the execution and as you

guys approach you can see the spectators

are getting really really excited as two

men in in robes in sort of white and

gold robes have what looks like a

prisoner and this prisoners not being

like there's not bound or anything he's

just being grabbed by the arms and has

been kind of lifted and hoisted off his

feet and is being dragged toward a gate

that's opening on one end and I'd like

you all to make perception checks my new

dice Chris yeah look what Chris sent me

yeah lucky lucky happy days come on come

on

so Jeff you've got a minus one on your

d20 role for which a equates to a three

so just go ahead and review out yeah

it's 22 nice I roll the 1 ok 13 13 okay

15 all right paulten and DF you can see

at the far end of the trench is another

gate and behind that are some would like

stalls or something and you see people

on the far end preparing to release what

looked like to be a pair of

velociraptors yeah

casual Velociraptor release cool I want

one of those and yeah so they open up

the thing and then the velociraptors

sort of go out and they disappear down

into the the floor of the trench and

this guy that they're holding looks like

it's gonna get deposited in the other

end of the trench and as he is drawn

toward what seems to be his death you

see another man about 30 feet behind him

being restrained by a third guard

just crying and bawling his eyes out and

crying out for been here Chris can I

make a perception check this happen all

right guys I don't have a clear

understanding of what's going on here's

my piece together so this guy is being

reunited with this pet philosopher he

doesn't like it's crap that's probably

definitely it and the man who is crying

and weeping because this other man is

being hauled off to his death says he

didn't do it he's not a thief he's not

just thief he didn't steal didn't steal

no strikes just like poignant Lee looks

at Diaz like don't do it whatever you're

thinking don't do it

all right update to the story I may have

been

slightly off and he cries out the name

of the man being dragged his doom trois

uh throws up oh that's just real sad is

is there a way we can walk around

executioner's yeah there are even the

the trench is in the middle of this wide

wide old dirt Avenue and you can

basically walk on either side of it and

you'll see depending on which side you

go around on just crowds of people

lining the fence of the trench on that

side with occasional gaps between the

more you can actually see and some of

the people watching are children and

some of them are adults yes do you think

he actually did it I mean I know some

other people who were accused of

stealing when they didn't actually steal

and I'm just real concerned that maybe

this person then and yeah if you rolled

high enough on your perception you can

hear that there are bets being taken on

whether or not he will survive and you

understand based on the bets and the

what they're saying is that if he can

get out of the trench on the other side

then he is free and he's good to go

ah but he's got to get past the

velociraptors well that's like a fair

thing and he doesn't have any weapons

anyway you see the velociraptors you

sort of glimpse them down at the bottom

of this of this 10-foot deep trench

making their way as animals do slowly up

the trench understanding implicitly that

their meal time is about to come and

then and the man right now is being sort

of dropped in is about to be dropped

into his end of the trench so now

so are we watching these from like

farther up so yeah you're at that you're

they'e you're at the road level sort of

walking along one side of this long

football field length trench which is

only about 20 feet wide okay so we're in

like the observer yeah and the Raptors

can't get to us correct

yeah they the Raptors cannot get up the

trench and over the fences oh I'm just

like throwing rocks at the Raptors

okay when you start to when you start to

do that you immediately people around

you begin to protest and scream at you

and say things like you can't do that

that's illegal how far away is the is

the trench with the Raptors it's as far

away as you want it to be like I said it

is a it is a 20 foot wide 200 foot long

trench all right down the length of this

road outside the city and there are

people gathering around it to watch to

see whether this guy escapes Politan if

you wanted to help instead of throwing

rocks at the dinosaurs you could play a

real nice song and maybe just inspire

him and he could run real fast or

inspire the dinosaurs whichever I don't

know who say anything about helping I'm

just gonna rocks okay my mistake

wait should I be helping do we want to

help who is this guy I you can see

umbrella kind of sneer at this whole

escapade and just say barbaric why

barbaric why you say barbaric and then

she just shouts at some of the people

embedding you're all barbarians yeah and

one of them an old woman shakes a finger

at her a leathery finger at her and says

don't you interfere no more I turned to

Chamba and I'm like you said this as

executioner's done what do they do here

I mean is this isn't this just the

culture of the place like shouldn't we

just kind of let this play out closed

all idiots

executioner's bun this is where they

cook up and create you sure situations

as I understand it it's leave these

people - what entertainment they have

okay Strix has walked away

unreal will say that is not correct do

not play with your friends nobody odds

is if what she just said is that it is

correct it is called executioner's run

because people have to run from one end

to the other to gain their freedom

criminals they call them are you a

criminal Chamba not that I know of

and neither is he probably hmm so you're

saying that there are liars I'm saying

that I think that man is going to get

eaten and he doesn't deserve it

I would like to dimension door into the

pit when you appear there's all kinds of

startled reactions now that you're at

the bottom of the pit looking up 10 feet

and then seeing the fences and all the

people gathered around as soon as you

appear they're all shocked because

they've never seen such magic before a

doorway open and then this strange

horned double figure step out in their

mid second I think that's really cool

Wow and then you realize you're in a

third with two velociraptors who when

they see you're now there begin charging

in your direction although there's still

like a hundred feet away from you is

interrupting the race where I am another

Velociraptor can I also fly to where she

is yes there's nothing stopping you from

taking flight and basically hovering

above her but you'll have to put down

your canoe probably unless you're gonna

use that as a weapon or something and

the canoe chamba oh so she just sort of

dumps me I can do on top of each other

chamba I'd like you to make a let's make

a you strength athletics check your plus

four on your check I roll the more I

want to do so all right as soon as she

drops the canoe on you it's a full

weight of it just sort of presses you

down to the ground you've kind of tried

to hold it up then your little arms give

out and the whole thing just falls on

top of you you're a muffled like I can't

how far are the Raptors from well I'm

still up there

yeah far they issue they they're

probably about a hundred and twenty feet

away from you but getting closer by the

second as they barrel down the trench

towards Strix who's in the midst of

casting another spell since we're all

doing things now let's roll initiative

yay all right even miss Perkins

yeah you

they don't have a plan like I always

have a plan but it's a plan all right

let's start with idea 16 yeah 1909 teen

4df who got the 16 me okay Chum bug got

the 16 Strix 13 evylyn 19 Moulton 18 all

right and dragon bait got 16 and Umbro

got a 12 all right so

evylyn and DF you're the first to react

evil and I'm gonna say we'll go for you

first you fly you drop the canoe you fly

over that's a move action to get on top

of Strix is there anything else you want

to do you can see Strix is getting ready

to cast what appears to be for one of

her favorite spells silent image I hover

above Strix and then I cast speak with

animals which should allow me to

communicate with beasts which dinosaurs

would qualify as this time Chris Bergen

I'm not checking that and just checking

the range of the spell alright okay yeah

you cast the spell on you so that's

great okay so um range is not an issue

and it's only one action so yeah now you

can talk to the animals I cast it on

myself and then I'm like excuse me but

could you please hold on for a second

before you eat my friend just say I

stand in front of her actually instead

of hovering above her I just go like

this

hold on just a second new friends okay

they will all right they're still about

a hundred feet away and offer her to

rolla for them oh they're pretty

high and so you don't exactly know if

you've had a reaction on that with them

yet I'll let you know if their demeanor

changes and DF what do you do when

suddenly you see evylyn a light and then

cast a little spell and then just start

speaking to the velociraptors

I second knew that she was dropped on

top of the Goblin yeah and lift it up so

he can scurry out from underneath daddy

can do okay and then I'll put the canoe

back down and then DF will just kind of

like sit up against it with like his

knees how I talked up through his chest

mm-hmm I just sit there okay very good

Colton what would you like to do I would

like to you see velociraptors are racing

toward evil and strix and you villains

talking to them and making Velociraptor

noises this is weird okay I'm going to

how far away are they from

evylyn and all them 100 feet hundred

feet yep

and it looks like based on how fast they

move on their next turn they'll close

that distance to about 40 feet okay I'm

gonna I'm at a dimension door down there

another door opens hmm ultimately halton

emerges I looked over look around to see

if everyone's like just as wowed yeah

they're like the first one was like a

big woo ah and then that same old woman

she is shouting cheaters cheaters

cheaters okay the lady from Princess

Bride needs to go boom

alright and paltin you can talk or move

if you want you just used an action at

that point I'm gonna I'm I walk out of

the door I'm just like cool what was I

gonna do oh dear yeah okay come back to

me alright the velociraptors go next and

they do indeed just barrel down the

trench and now

they're 40 feet away from paltin and

evylyn and Strix at the end of their

move that man who was dropped down the

trench you can see he's staying at the

back of the trench now that he's got

intermediaries he's just sort of

cowering down there and waiting to see

what happens and it is jumba's turn

jumba is currently doing battle with the

canoe well death lifted the canoe off of

I got to sell your casual jumba is

honorbound to engage so he's going to

rip his scimitar or scimitar however you

say that he's a scimitar a metre senator

it's a bit dark yeah he's scimitar then

that's a scimitar his Scot scabbard all

right enter into the fray so he's gonna

basically go into the trench and there's

a jump down into it oh yeah he's gonna

do a somersault probably all right um

just make a Athletics check to shimmy

down into the trench safely it's a plus

4 on your D 20 room

I wrote 16 you're good all right so you

slip through the fence the gaps on the

fence you shimmy down do a little tumble

and now you're in the dusty ground of

the trench you've been here before and

you see there's like little bits of

entrails and things in the sand that you

remember some body parts that weren't

cleaned up from the last run things like

that but yeah there are two

velociraptors

it took you about 20 feet to get down

into the trench of your 30 feet of

movement so you got about 10 feet left

if you want to run ahead of the others

does it look like any of the parties in

peril they unclear one that looks like

it looks like the doll woman is talking

to the velociraptors and the

velociraptors look hungry like they

haven't eaten in a day

yeah well I'm intelligence 5 you guys so

I understand your situation I'm gonna

run forward and I in striking distance

you will not you could be you could run

right up to them but you

wouldn't be able to attack or you could

move the rest of your ten feet and just

stand your ground and wait for them to

come to you such good options

no I if the group's not going forward

I'm gonna look I'm gonna pull out my

sword yeah and be ready to go but I'm

not gonna okay you're not gonna go

pell-mell

in today's option I'm good to the jaws

of death although you feel better now

having a weapon last time you were down

here they didn't give you anything

yeah I mumble to myself that it I knew

I'd end up back here all right

dragon bait well he's definitely not

gonna leave his friends down there so he

will follow the Goblin and throw himself

up over the fence make a check to try to

yes he lands safely at the bottom of the

pit and he draws forth his big sword

ready to hack anything that gets close

and actually he's going to sort of loom

over you chumba to your defense because

it looks like you are probably the one

least equipped to fend off to the loss

of Raptors on your voice Mel anything

yes you do and so does Strix and so does

paltin but evylyn does not you smell

[Music]

violets like the flower ooh

extent of violets feeling comforted by

the the

dragon bait I kind of yell over my

shoulder give him a nod and say if you

could make it smell of ham again and he

just shakes his head and is his jaws

tight and he's his raised brow furrows

like he's ready for business and then we

dropped two Strix you have a spell that

you're in the midst of casting Strix i

yes i was going to find me a silent

image preferably in front of myself and

evil ends in front of me correct on one

yes and then paulten is on the other

side yes alright I'm gonna put this

silent image in front of paltin okay

that's just it's going to be of another

scarier Velociraptor all right so a

scary Velociraptor appears before you

paltin but you're aware that strix

created it because you've seen her do

this many many times use the spell for

various and sundry reasons so yeah and

it just sort of silently stands in front

of you this Velociraptor cool yeah

alright then appear that my voice is

coming out of the Velociraptor okay I'm

still coming out of you well if it's in

front of me maybe they think that that

Velociraptor is talking to them the may

be good yeah

alright so Strix is doing that you see

uhm Braille up there he pulls out a sack

puts it over the old lady's head and

just drags her away by it that's right

she drags the heckler off but that

doesn't stop a number of individuals

around the fence some of them are

cheering because they love the spectacle

and marvel of us and what they were

expecting at all this is great but a few

of the died the older set the the die

and the wool vengeance seekers who want

to see these criminals put to justice

you know they start throwing rocks at

you

so paltin Rock comes in your direction

but doesn't come anywhere close to

hitting you one of them would have

struck the illusory Velociraptor but

just sort of passes harmlessly right

through it dragon bait actually gives

dragon bait dragon bait is beamed by a

rock he's hit on the head but doesn't

seem fazed by it at all he just said and

then chamba a rock comes for you but

also misses

and then evylyn another miss and then

Strix you're the last one to be targeted

by Iraq and that's also a Miss so a

bunch of missed rocks from a bunch of

shitty throwers and then we come to

[Laughter]

video I just assumed that that was like

the person throwing the rock yeah me too

[Laughter]

evylyn your turn comes up again and

you're still talking to these creatures

they're much closer now and they do seem

to acknowledge you they can't talk back

but they do kind of they do slow down

they slow their pace and are now just

sort of walking toward you I'm like

that's great we're all gonna be such

good friends now now why are your names

new friends they tell you with just

shrieks really that they don't have

names that they acknowledge anyway oh

well I'll call you special and

sweetheart

oh the two Hawks are out there sort of

look at each other and then they look

back to you I think we're all gonna be

great friends if you could just tell

there's food there's there might be food

yeah I know I guess I assume you're sort

of like fluttering slowly closer to them

in a sort of very kind of

non-threatening way dude yeah I do that

I mean they'd see that it's me they

don't ya know they sort of look at the

other dinosaur and they kind of sniff it

a little bit and it's just sort of

yammering silently but they're not quite

convinced that it's one of them they

don't recognize it from the Velociraptor

you know

College where they went so they don't

recognize me from Velociraptor school so

it must be some sort of strange creature

I asked them what they want I'm like how

are you how are you doing today are they

treating you well here you find out that

they have been not fed for the past day

stop starved practically they are

famished

they have been mistreated woefully and

that they came here to eat what could be

their last meal would you like to come

live with us instead yeah they they ask

you if you have food I mean we could go

get something to eat they they look

hungrily

at the rest of your party no you can't

eat those why not they say and this

whole this whole conversation is just

like those are also my friends and if

you eat them then I'd have to fight you

and I don't want to fight you because

we're friends they say in their shrieks

they say they're friends with you yeah

and those are my friends too so I might

have money also he has money buy good

food hmm

well do you understand that if you try

to eat those people I'm gonna have to

like chop off your heads I don't like

that I mean I don't want to but that's

just reason to be backed

tell them there's way more food outside

of this pit there's a whole audience

fooled people did even starts to tell

them that man is like waiting to what

you can see at this point the the bullet

you've you've basically talked the

velociraptors into not advancing toward

you but as the spell says they can

provide any information that they know

which isn't a hell of a lot they pretty

much told you their life story yeah but

it doesn't really alter their

fundamental demeanor as creatures so

they're not reliable companions and

you're well I tell them one last thing

just don't eat these and I'll get you

other food do eat these and I will kill

you I'm sorry alright they will kind of

wander off and just sort of circle

around waiting to receive something okay

occasionally looking back at you waiting

I can I Drive an action still yeah you

can I go get one of the carcasses and

bring it back to them oh um yeah they're

they're sort of a little ways back but

if you want to just flutter off that's

fine you guys

are you gonna tell your friends what

you're doing can I can I make it there

and back in one turn or no are there any

other dead things around not really no

okay I say going to get you food hold on

and I tell my friends oh no they're not

gonna believe that so don't leave how

about I go get them I'll go get the food

you stuck here go get one of those food

all right don't get it don't get an

audience member so strix you fly up in

your thing your broom thing you take out

a knife or whatever you you cut loose

one of the carcasses and you basically

haul it back great this that probably

looks great yeah you drop this rotting

fly infested carcass down on the ground

and the velociraptors aren't picky they

just start tearing at it great time

believes and while this is going on you

see that man that that accused criminal

who was thrown down in the pit he sort

of inched his way along the walls and

with the velociraptors distracted and

he's up against the wall he's just

trying to make it to the other end of

the trench I would let him go I mean

this we don't want you to die also this

we just wanted to feed velociraptors we

had nothing to do with your son and he's

just sort of he just sort of mouthed you

as he inches his way past and then once

he's about thirty feet clear of the

velociraptors he just bolts as fast as

his feet can carry him he's in bare feet

he just runs across the sand as far as

you go and the two velociraptors they

take notice and they both sort of look

up toward

and make moves to run after him no no no

so no evylyn I would like you to make a

persuasion check to try to keep them

from succumbing to their predatory

natures

oh you're muted Ana you're muted I was

saying all sorts of cool things so just

trust me they were cool and I got a

twenty six all right you're able to hold

their attention long enough that they

forget about the darting figure running

away from them I tell them a cool story

about Lysander the morning Lord okay the

muted is what's tricks her all right and

the man makes it to the end and there's

some cheers and also some boos and you

see as he was running toward the end he

does get pelted by some rocks from

people who don't think that this is

justice served one of the rocks actually

hits hits him so hard that he goes down

and he's like bleeding profusely from

his head but he gets back up and makes

it the rest of the way poor dude and

then once he gets to the end

he's like grasping on and some people

grab him by the arms and pull him up and

then the people who were throwing rocks

at him and feeling like justice wasn't

served their boos are sort of drowned

out by cheers from his friends and other

people who know him or have known him

his whole life who are grateful that he

made it to the end of the executioners

run and it's at that point where you all

hear a loud horn

[Music]

this sort of echo over the entire city

followed by a distant gong Inge bong

[Music]

bong-bong-bong and this is it sounds

like it's coming from the way the other

end of port lions are ooh but as soon as

the horn sounds and the gong sounds the

whole tenor around this Plaza with

executioner's Run changes and people

begin to panic and run for the gates

sure that's fine why are we all leaving

so fast I try to ask someone you're down

in the play you're kind of down in the

pit right now so chumba why is everyone

leaving so fast

Samba has no idea but umbral who is up

their nose and but she's not she's not

down with you and dragon bait knows but

he ain't talking the rest of you can

smell the the violets give away to ham

you easily can zoom out of the trench

it's gonna take a take your perimeter

look at us as you as you go up high you

can say yes people are climbing out of

their residences and basically thank you

they're grabbing baskets of belongings

and basically anything they can carry

and are very quickly making their way

into the gates and you can see there are

now more guards on the wall basically

doing this telling people get inside get

inside get inside we should get inside

okay cut straight my umbral during all

of this just like she mentioned anything

or so umbral comes back from having

dragged that old woman off and giving

her a stern talking-to when she comes

back she shouts down undead must be

attacking the other side of the city

they're pulling everyone in as a

precaution Oh

keep going or should we go inside when

you do that she says I don't know but

you see no I not and dragon bait kind of

looks around the smell of ham losing

from his pores and it changes to it

seems to be mixed with the smell of

brimstone and then it changes to violets

like he's just going through all these

emotions through scent and then he takes

his sword and he points it off in a

direction not toward the city I mean as

he does that kind of yelling over the

clamor searching for meaning in my eyes

I just look at him and say switch it

back to him he looks at me when his face

sort of contort and then he like thinks

about it and then he he kind of led to

this worried expression appear on his

face and then suddenly you start to

smell the ham come out again and he kind

of grabs you by your sort of gear and

your scruff and sort of drags you to the

edge of the trench so that he can boost

you up chumba see me completely go along

with it for one of the first times in a

long time in their income he grabs you

he pushes you up so that you can sort of

reach up and grab the fence posts and

pull yourself up out of the trench okay

and then he's gonna try to climb out of

the trench himself and he's don't try to

help him okay so he has your he you aid

him he gets to advantage on the check

and yes you are able to help pull him up

out of the trench and he's when you pull

him up he kind of looks at you with some

surprise like he didn't expect your

small little courted body to have that

much strength in it and I don't notice

it Chris cuz I'm actually using this

opportunity to lean in and smell him

even closer okay what are the rest of

you doing as people are withdrawing into

the city strix from your height you

don't see any

Asians of imminent danger in this but

you know port 9 Tsar was a sprawling

place and there are hills separating

this end of the city from the other end

of the city so you can't even see if

there's any danger at all right well if

I see dragon bait pointing the sword

I'll just kind of circle down and just

you know make sure that that waffles and

yes and everyone are fine and be like

alright dude you're supposed to bring

back a carcass yeah I did that's why I

didn't they were eating and remember oh

okay yeah that happened I was distracted

by worry alright so once he's up topside

and out of the trench dragon bait starts

to move in the opposite direction from

the hordes of people running through the

gate and people just sort of blow past

him as he cuts a path through the crowd

probably got Chamba following close

behind him leaving port lions aru and

heading toward the edge of this shanty

town toward the wilderness all right

well I'm assuming that we're following

so well palton is still down in the

trench so this thing with the feasting

velociraptors everybody is vacating yes

oh cool summers they update I guess it's

uh guess it's time to go so I and

correct me if I can't do it this way but

I take out my mandolin mm-hmm I start

playing yep and I'm gonna use it to cast

fly on myself yes and I fly out all

right yes yeah I didn't mention that

yeah I can like fly now let's first

receive this yeah you see him play his

instrument and then he just lifts off

like Peter Pan can I be riding the

mandolin like it's my own you can after

you've kept like once you play it to

cast the spell and you don't need to

play anymore you can basically just tuck

it between your legs and float out

I don't like this I don't like this

magic rivalry going on you can would

like to resist to worry about Oh

everyone is having a nice time plus

blind is faster

so as I'm flying it's too much motion

for my drunk self it's fine flying's is

faster now canoes just having a good

time I'm getting the canoe calm down I

go get a canoe so even sort of got hers

DF you're gonna help umbrella pick up

the second one yeah okay she's gonna be

like all the heavy lifting

I'm just stabilized yeah got it yeah

you've just got this sort of the end of

it yeah walking from behind and just

holding holding the tail of the canoe

alright and you begin to leave and the

crowd becomes thinner and thinner and

thinner until there's nobody around you

you're just walking through the end of

this shantytown and it just falls into

more and more dilapidated ruins until

the ruins become engulfed with plants

and ivy and vines and then sort of off

sucked a little bit back in behind the

trees outside of this shantytown is

something that you recognize Champa is

one of the city's great garbage pits

that's where you got nabbed and it

doesn't look like dragon baits headed

toward anywhere near the garbage pit but

is sort of veering around it I'm with

him right yeah he's kind of he's kind of

trailblazing now he's he's in the front

of the group leading leading them umbral

and

DR behind you carrying one canoe evylyn

is managing another canoe by herself she

sort of got her balance and equilibrium

sorted out and then waffles is sort of

galumphing behind her this big giant al

bear where's Simon that's a good

question

fly works on one creature and one

creature alone paltin so Simon is still

on the ground looking up going silently

saying huh his palms actual reaction and

then you start to see Simon just sort of

run after you with his hands up in the

air he's not like light enough to carry

on my shoulders is he he's technically a

separate creature

so the spell would cease to work you

know he's running around the I'll grab

him and put him on top of the canoe I'm

carrying okay you'll have to set the

canoe down and then have him climb on

the canoe and then you can lift the

canoe back up again that's fine tell I'm

encouraging things like oh we're gonna

go for ride is this gonna be fun it

started it seemed that way and then you

start to sort of trot along and he's

like grabbed trying to hold onto the top

of this give you and it's moving like

this and he's just not having a good

time I'm like yeah at that point he he

jumps off the canoe you just sort of

hear him walk off the end of your canoe

and then he goes over to Waffles stands

in front of waffles and then grabs her

by the fur and just sort of pulls

himself up onto her yes yes it's

probably used to doing that yes they

have a system and they have a system

which they've used for 50 years

okay so he's now riding on waffles as

you go galumphing off into the

wilderness and the trees as you enter

them

are a number of them look like they were

cleared away long ago so a lot of this

growth is now only maybe 3040 years old

and so the trees aren't horrendously big

but pretty quickly as you sink into the

jungle things become more dense and

dragon bait has to basically use his

sword to carve a path big enough so that

your canoes don't get caught on stuff

when I see him doing it okay you're like

down there low just being like well

actually I'm Sharma's got a good sized

cemet are so when he's whirling that

thing around he's he's cutting down some

low branches and a dragon baits just

sort of swishing the branches ahead of

him taking just like fireball in front

of us all right I mean you can but you

don't know what you know yeah maybe

maybe

maybe right all right let's like start

taking off branches yep and for the rest

for several hours you hack and cut your

way through the underbrush map making

stuff and it's trying to make a career

map along the way oh very good

okay so DF is the self-elected mapper

that's good to have and and you were

told DF that a valuable map is is the

map is definitely worth something and

after a couple so you're far enough away

from the city now that you can't hear

much commotion from back there and the

loud horns and stuff have stopped and I

need everybody to make perception checks

yes 7:17 1910 also 10 okay

I was just about to say this dye has

been pretty lucky so far uh after about

an hour now let's say two hours of

hacking through dragon bait has kind of

led you to the edge of land you see that

you are at the tops of cliffs

overlooking a great misty Bay and

there's thick jungle almost going rate

up to the cliff's edge so when you sort

of come out you're kind of surprised

when everything sort of opens up in

front of you and all on one side of you

is to sort of open air with cliffs

tumbling down to rocks and this great

expanse of water and dragon bait begins

to move along the tops of the cliffs

where the verge is a little thinner and

it's at that point DF that you you get

that feeling of being watched that

you're so accustomed to danger sense

tingling and I always have that feeling

yeah in this case though you're you're

so distracted by sense of ham and other

aromas that seem to be issuing from this

drag this dinosaur man Aaron too

distracted to pay attention to the fact

that great danger is following you or

has been following you through the

forest DF the scent that comes up behind

you is one of the death always smell

death you smelled death and living bait

is ahead of me he is he is ahead of you

yes still trailblazing

and then you hear like snapping twigs

and other sounds rustling sounds to

suggest that creatures have picked up on

your scent and have followed you and

closed the distance now to the extent

that you can smell the odor of

coming off of them I don't smell

anything I think we're just fine

when you look back into the dark jungle

that you've just emerged from the hacked

path that you've been following you can

see it there it's dark like you don't

you can't realize just how dark you were

in there for a while but you don't see

anything but you know there's something

there

I immediately alert the party just that

something approaches we're being

followed it smells of death all right so

like everyone like instant ready mode

weapons out okay because out on a limb

and say I think that might be some

undead canoes down given DS vigilance

none of you are surprised when suddenly

you see gray skinned ghouls for lack of

a better word just suddenly begin to

pile out of the forest like they've been

tracking you and come at you in a wave

of claws and teeth like everybody's

spooked I'd like everybody to roll

initiative again so what does that so

what does that actually mean for you

guys meet you 22 for evylyn your decks

there and your modifier which is +2 so

22 so 22 for chumba and evylyn Strix 11

df9 paltin Gees script I'm just like I

fall and I rolled a five five all right

I'm gonna assume a Simon happens on your

turn okay I'm real world's like - all

right and the ghouls the goals are sort

of they're not slow but they're sort of

clamouring out of the jungle foliage and

so they have a ways to go to get to you

they're about 30 feet away when they

pile out from the darkness and you can

count 10 of them and these ghouls stay

close to me I'll protect you they look

like emaciated men and women humans from

they were made out of humans but their

palette gray skin is tight around their

bones and their limbs seem to be almost

artificially elongated like you think

they clearly as humans did not have

fingers that long or arms that long or

legs that long or tongues that long and

you see just hate for life burning in

their eyes and on some of them they have

what appeared to be tattooed on their

shriveling foreheads green or certain

blue triangles like that's some sort of

symbol or glyph or something and as they

pile out toward you chumba what do you

do with these ten ghouls coming at you

in a pack are they I mean I'm sorry how

close were they they're 30 feet away and

you're you're when you turn to them your

back is at the cliffs okay

jumbo feels like he has an idea of what

has to happen but he looks towards

dragon bait who is a little too slow to

respond dragon bait was kind of ahead of

you test checking the ground to make

sure it was safe to walk on when all of

this happened so he's just sort of

turning going oh okay he looks back

towards the ghouls yep there's ham I

know what that means

ham or all right you can get you could

get to you could get to the nearest

ghoul and attack one yeah I got 5 foot

reach I'll do it all right

then make an attack roll your scimitar

bonus you're plus 4 to hit oh and

remember this since these creatures are

man-sized they're medium they're larger

than you you can use your fury of the

small ability if you want let's do it

but why

Wow all right so you will do your old

2d6 instead of 1d6 on your damage and

you'll add four and if you want to use

your fury of the small you'll add

another two on top of that always your

fury of the small yeah

all right so 2d six plus six a seven

plus six then so 13 and plus 2 is 15

power all right nice yeah so the little

goblin goes up and just digs deep into

the lead ghoul and that ghoul is still

alive but very very hurt as our new

little friend charges in I just yell

from the back I'm like evylyn acting

simultaneously to chamba what do you do

yes I'm like ooh this is gonna feel good

and I kind of shake out tree bane I get

I get divine smite ready

undead yeah it's gonna feel good and I

just go I go in for the closest one just

alrighty Bane before two misses okay the

closest one is the one that chumba just

dug deep into so you want to try to

finish that one off no let him have that

one for the next all right go on make

your attack 17 that is a hit

huzzah and I am going to use divine

smite to expend this spell slot to do an

extra to d8 per spell level damage

radiant damage plus an extra one because

it's an undead okay so my original

damage is do okay so first we do huh 8

plus 4 is 12

oh okay and then we're expending a spell

slot to do one okay 13 per spell level

I'm just doing it as a first level so I

guess we'll just do the one and then the

extra one d8 because it's undead itself

seven

so anything 20 that's 20 that's 20

points of damage okay all right so that

one too is also grievously hurt aha by

the light of a sander I compel you all

right and then it is Wow get a second

one oh yes you do

[Laughter]

that does not hit well even was so

excited about running down the line of

Lysander that she swung a little wide

she did all right then

next up is dragon bait all right

he again he has a sword out already he

is going to go striding forth

bravely his ham smell hmm chain was to

let's say what would be work best here

lemon as he brings his sword up and

comes up over Chum buzz head and tries

to finish off jumba's cool we move in an

acrobatic beautiful just yep alright um

take average damage here he decapitates

the ghoul and as the sword cuts through

the ghouls flesh there is a explosion of

radiant energy and the ghoul

it's shrieks as its head is detached

from its body and as its head is still

flying up in the air that radiant energy

just sort of blows it all apart into

ashes and the ghouls body also just

crashes down into ashes and then for his

second attack he'll swing at yours

evylyn and the same thing happens

he decapitate that ghoul and it explodes

with radiant light and turns to burnt

ashes with a scream the morning Lord is

with us and so those two ghouls

and dragon bait is done and its tricks

astern there are eight goals left in a

pack Strix alright fire explodes around

dragon bait and evylyn and humba humba

this roar of green flame just blows up

all around you and you think you're just

about to get incinerated by it when it

just sort of wraps around you harmlessly

hmm my last thought was of ham am NOT

lemon yeah still the ham okay so you're

rolling damage tricks and your save DC

is I'm sorry fifteen sixteen sixteen all

right yeah okay then I got a bunch of

saving throws here and their dexterity a

plus two and after that I would like to

misty stab someplace where they cannot

reach me okay so four of the eight are

incinerated by your flames and destroyed

completely the others the four that

remain are all badly badly burnt their

gray skin is now just black sari and

[Music]

your fireball also just sort of

incinerate some of the plants around

them and you can see little stray flames

here there and everywhere

after the fireball abates little fires

all around I'm really hoping I got a

couple of those tree frogs too because

they sound alright and death you're up

now I cannot sneak attack on dude

correct

you sure can I can yep mmm-hmm

interesting good so I'm gonna take out

gutter gap I'll find is there a still

engage in melee with evil in chumba or

driving bait not yet no no they all got

past yeah okay well I'll take I'm gonna

take gutter up to one that was

absolutely incinerator constructs and

try to finish that off alright

no I'm really undead so that's like

attacking with this I like kind of

mentally say to myself slash gutter good

you drink nothing this day now let's

attack it and you hit gutter says

there's always tomorrow d99 dam is you

kill it okay

and it falls lifeless onto the ground

alright and then it's Paul tooms turning

so I go I go up and oh by the way palton

in the time that has a lab since you

last classify spell your fly spell would

have ended because it's a ten-minute

effect so you're back to her feet

sure yeah so I think to myself I like by

some kind of outside force that totally

is not metagaming whatsoever whatever

that means in this universe I somehow

just remembered that I have the Sun

sword you sure do didn't even need until

now so people can stop yelling at me

alright you draw the hilt of a sword out

and it ignites with a radiant blade yep

alright so now you can make even charge

up and make a melee attack with that I

remember the Sun sort of gives you a

plus two bonus to hit and you'll do an

extra d8 damage radiant to this undead

if you hit go cool so for only do I add

my strength or you do so you're that

missile long since you actually used a

sword alright so looking at your

character sheet here it doesn't have

here talking honest uh so your

proficiency bonus is plus five your

strength is twos plus two so that's plus

seven sword gives you plus nine to it so

rather be twenty and add nine cool

you said D 20 plus 9 yeah that's correct

yeah that would be a 22 okay

are you using one hand or two hands cuz

you deal more damage with the weapon if

you use both I'm gonna use both Chris

Harkins hits in that case you do a d-10

plus two plus a d8 on top of it all

okay cool this is the later part you're

flying on the mandolin marks everywhere

that totals to 13 okay yeah you totally

 it up your business your blade goes

clean through it like a lightsaber blade

and shears it in half and it just

collapses into ash all around you

I'm just like man this thing's cool yeah

alright there are two more goals left it

is their turn they go ahead of umbral de

Simon get to shoot a dart though oh yeah

he will shoot a dart although I'm dead

mmm he doesn't know he'll take a shot he

hits a ghoul so that's gonna do a d4

alright

so a Google gets stuck in the eye with

the dark yeah but doesn't take any of

the poison damage because it's immune

and so now it's alive but it's got a

dart sticking that's right yeah awesome

yeah it moves around the ghouls eyeball

as it leaps at palton so palton first

thing it's gonna try to do actually the

only thing it's gonna try to do is claw

you cool and it rolled a 12 to hit which

is not enough

so you'd if you dodge out of the way of

that the other ghoul is going to go

after D F and DF it rolled a 22 hit

alright so it slashes you

do-do-do-do for a total of let's see

that'll be seven slashing damage reduced

to three by your uncanny dodge and since

you are not an elf or I'm dead I need

you to make a constitution saving for

sure do

[Applause]

d/f you suddenly become paralyzed and go

rigid and just kind of fall over

probably still clutching gutter in your

hand yeah but the rest of you just see

him go absolutely rigid and come and

fall and then exasperatedly and let's

see umbral gonna do can I point out

using the initiative to waffle circle

oh yeah absolutely

she's a killing machine yep yeah so

umbrella is just going to cast a sacred

flame which will fly down from the

heavens and attempt to strike one of the

goals and does she beams it and as soon

as this sacred flame strikes the bool

and hits it just blows apart and is

destroyed leaving waffles to charge the

last one the last one is like leering

over deaath having just felled him and

as it's got it twitching his little

claws and salivating with it's burnt all

the flesh burnt off its face suddenly

this hulking mass of fur lunges at it

out of nowhere and we'll make a bite

attack gonna miss the albear with the

beak and hit the albear with its claws

and with average damage waffles just

wrens this thing to pieces and then just

snarls

and bits of google go flying everywhere

cooked cool everywhere and all of the

ghouls are destroyed

even though Diaz didn't wanna keep you

you still protect him good girl waffles

she is a good girl can you heal the

earth just look to the ground he's just

like actually umbral says I can take

care of him I've got it I've got it I've

got it

stand aside let the cleric do its work

my pleasure

she will kneel down and utter a prayer

to torment every time she says torm she

says very loudly and then she will place

a hand on Dee I think has lesser

restoration removing the paralyzation

effect is it nice that we can use the

less powerful God to do the less

important things less powerful less

powerful she gets in your face at this

point I don't think so little one you

know who can measure the power of the

morning Lord so I like walk between I'm

trying but I'm like hey hey hey she says

like morning is like what an hour Torme

is all day lady just walks up and she's

like they can both die so don't worry

about it they'll just be floating in the

astral plane one day Peppino

is finally sat up from being paralyzed

he's just sitting there this kind of

says aloud to himself I think I hate

salt it's nice it's our nice new place

to live it's look we're not living here

and I had my hug I forgot her name

umbrella umbrella

no wonder umbrellas so mad at you I keep

running the collar professor I keep

wanting to color Umbridge some bread

chef but yeah I'm like see look we're

friends we are all here for the same

reason the great the good of mankind

you're right you're right yeah we

shouldn't fight amongst each other we've

got plenty of other things to vent our

frustrations on in the name of the

morning lord I agree then a bug just

sort of bite your second can i maybe

check doing our contract to see if I

know what those triangles were yeah you

can history or Arcana would be fine

[Music]

sixteen okay you remember seeing that

symbol in one of the books in Wakanda

atomos library it is the symbol of roz

me see boom the evil warlord who waged

war on child centuries ago so he's

supposedly dead he's supposedly dead but

in his day he used an army of undead to

attack the city of Mesirow you recall

all right so we might have a new freshly

living undead person who is sending

undead after us for some unknown reason

and as you say that the Sun just at that

moment sort of dips under the mountains

to the west and darkness begins to creep

across you oh good and now it's getting

dark darkness we can never be in true

darkness when we are bathed in the light

of the morning laws I just really wish

you wouldn't say those things

you know where you can control the

lighting as a dragon bait just sort of

cleans the ghoul dust off his blade he

smells like tar yeah and he pulls out a

wineskin and just sort of gives a

triumphant drink many hands and it hands

out the wine skin to the nearest

character which is like DF actually is

probably chamba he goes jumbo alright

always tell me numbers right there

waiting for the ham waiting for the ham

and shaking a little bit nervous because

in his mind he's just made his best

friend in the whole world and he he

drinks it and is not he's secretly very

worried about what it is doesn't know

okay Alton saw wine so therefore he is

the next closest character alright when

you drink it you realize that it is at

edge it's a sort of a honey ale drink

from port and I'm sorry that you're

drinking

but you drink some you pass it off to

paltin paltin drinks probably the rest

hence the empty wine skin off to the

next person

[Laughter]

and she's like I saw that first hit you

dealt that was that was pretty ferocious

yeah thank you my scimitar named his

moon blade of the darkness night and

[Laughter]

give him away to a hard pat on the back

drives a coffin like a cure but you

knock him off balance cause he's very

small when dragon bait gets his wines

came back here he's like a completely

empty that he starts to smell like roses

and then he puts it away and then he

starts to he just sort of taps Chamba on

the shoulder points with his sword in a

direction and goes off in that direction

I look back at the group and say dragon

bait wants us to follow him and also

communicates that he and I are now best

friends

[Laughter]

alright we're still going good

yes and you walk and walk and walk

following staying near the cliffs and

then as it gets quite dark just as the

last little bit of light lets you see

pretty much anything you come to a

promontory where dragon bait just sort

of stopped

oops he plants his sword in the ground

and then he sort of assumes kind of

meditative pose like he's appeasing

appealing to some sort of higher power

for guidance or something but it lasts

only about 10-15 seconds and as you're

waiting for him to come to his senses

you look around you see past the cliffs

down some ways you must have climbed a

fair bit up but down probably the rest

of your next morning is journey you can

see the mouth of the river so ssin start

spilling into the bay I look back at the

group and say that is the river known as

silk and wind and based on you see that

you can dragon bait just sort of

gestures to set down the canoes and he

just sort of makes himself comfortable

on this promontory like this is where

he's stopping for the night yeah we make

camp here okay all right we make hot we

make the hut goes up all the stars in

the night sky come out you can see

dragon bait is kind of entranced by them

and periodically just loses himself

staring up at the sky I give them a tour

of Paulson's hut and the great thing

about the hut paulten is it keeps all

the bugs out mm-hmm the other great

thing about the hut is when it goes up

I'm also instantly in like a red silk

robe a little modification you made to

dispel at some point yeah I already came

in eight the pie why do you guys think

they're gonna be over here I'm glad you

mention that yeah so as nice ignores

even again about those hags as the night

wears on and you're all sleeping soundly

in the comforts of the hut watching bugs

crawl on the outside of the

that's trying to find their way in but

can't and yes dragon bait does kind of

doze off and umbral dozes off and Chum

bud dozes off and you all gradually doze

off except you evylyn who you can sleep

and you do need rest but you don't don't

feel fatigue like the rest of the party

does I do shut down so I could recharge

you do my spell yes and as you're all

 everyone else to fall asleep

though and I kind of watched them

happily while they're sleeping for a

second and then I go the hags visit once

more they come in their spectral ghosted

forms and ride you like they're having

sex with you Halton DF and Strix and as

they do they pull out blades and stick

them in your chest and slice you open

down the middle from your neck to your

groin and you can feel you don't feel

you don't feel like you're bleeding out

or anything it just feels like a

tingling like this just slashes you one

clean stroke

each and they peel back your chest and

they pull out a another sack and they

dump it next to them and what comes out

of the sack is a gigantic maggot like

worm sort of yellowish white segmented

and it flops out next to them and they

can it grabs it by the body and it's

this worm is about four and a half five

feet long and it doesn't end in a worms

head it ends in what looks like a

twisted contorted human's head and it's

just howling and the hag puts it into

your chest pushes it down inside of you

while it's still screaming and then

closes up your chest and starts

stitching it up just so just sewing it

all up and while this process is going

on you can just barely move you're just

sort of looking and watching

as the stitches go and sew up your

entire chest and the screaming finally

is smothered as all of the stitches

tighten and the sound is completely

muffled and then the hags all look at

each other with their scissors and their

thread and they just turn to a sort of

ghostly vapor and disappear and I don't

like the x-files third night slightly

less fun yeah all right start to yeah

they're riding like you're having sex I

was like man why didn't you say jumbo

and they said and then they cut you open

and put a worm in I was like all right

so as that as they disappear the three

of you all awaken and you you sort of

immediately look at your chest to see

the damage that was done and there's no

evidence that any wound was inflicted

upon you one still just like they did at

all yeah you can make an arc on a check

all right

22 so when evil souls are or when evil

people die their souls often end up in a

place called Hades right there.this they

are there they are turned into worm-like

creatures called larvae rich light hags

are known to sell it's basically the

soul of an evil person trapped in this

horrific form and damned for all time to

the lower planes to be basically used as

barter for making things they have taken

larvae and put them inside of you so you

now have a second soul an evil soul

locked inside your bodies all right

mm-hmm

yeah you think that that is that this

should worry you to die now and the soul

monger were to take try to take your

soul it would take that soul instead oh

that makes sense

oh this is gonna be bad

[Music]
