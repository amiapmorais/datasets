come to dice camera action welcome back

Sam

thank you happy to be here at least one

of us is you know we just got last week

said he was happy to be here oh my god

yeah the Internet's are still echoing

with thee

yeah the gasps previously in dice camera

action back when they were fighting fire

Giants the waffle crew obtained an iron

flask from a band of drow with the aid

of a treacherous member of said band of

drow named chosen sir Lauren yes yeah

why treacherous because you betrayed

your fellow drow no that's just normal

and by definition right yes all all

drower technically or most drower

technically treacherous so you know it's

just a little sensitivity please and

shortly thereafter DF felt strongly

motivated to uncork said flask and why

you did it by accident short no choice

words

I wasn't like huh I wonder it was nose

death was strongly motivated to save all

of the slaves have been there for he is

a good person right that go young a

flask and incinerated all of them thank

you

so I don't need to go over that ground

again with the help of Ben wind bronze

bottom evylyn in water deep slew one of

her neighbors a human detective named

Vincent trench who turned out to be a

rock shaza in disguise so good job in

the tiger's eye detective agency Ben

Winn found a book filled with infernal

text written in blood and did

what you do when you find an infernal

text he stuffed it down his pants and

later gave it to DF so DF you I believe

you are currently in custody of said

evil book

yeah it's covered in didn't win residue

right these Ameth are hatched an

elaborate scheme to steal

Evelyn's statue from the spires of the

morning after Ben win blinded the

beholder with a javelin throw straight

into its anti-magic eye the XANA thar

screaming petrified Ben win and then

promptly turned his statue to dust with

the disintegration ray the beholder then

charmed evylyn but before he could

escape with her Strix stepped in cast a

polymorph spell on evylyn and turned her

into a snail not a chicken but it

surprisingly yeah and so we pick up

where we left off evylyn is a snail in

Strix his hands DF you were able to

recover the weapons that Ben when

dropped as he was turned to stone yeah

and you are standing in the cathedral

which is empty except for the shattered

remains of the evil and statue scattered

across the floor yeah and we heard

Zenith are crazy his way out Tom passed

a whole and like away correct so he feel

pretty certain that he's gone yes good

snail you have okay good snail layouts

the one snail villains malevolent agony

she's got a little Ben win helmet on

snail build an abalone shell bigmar

thing all right first things first

I apologize to the snail few Wiggles her

eye stalks comfortingly okay well your

stole I think you're still charmed yeah

I think she still is too so the first

thing we need to do is Strix we need to

get stable and as far as way from Zenith

are as we possibly can right now

maybe you're far away talking is just

talking like it go far are we talking

not single far just physical distance

away from where we last saw her so that

evylyn doesn't try to chase after him or

something right maybe well maybe whoa

maybe since this is so bad I mean maybe

we could like ask the black staff for

help I know magic they'll listen to me

look I turned her into a snail maybe

it's not a bad idea

they know sauce and port 9 sorry before

we blew that up that's actually not a

bad idea I'll have you checking a couple

of things first and then if then we'll

go to them but right now

far away as possible so she doesn't try

to do anything foolish underneath her

goddamn charm

you're also not entirely certain whether

or not this building is going to blow up

ah I guess we shall so that was

threatened at some point Chris when I

had retrieved the axes I also wanted to

make sure I got like a small bit of

binman doesn't Indust done yeah just in

case that's required for any kind of

resurrection or anything well you do

have some experience in this area we

resurrected paulten based on your

previous variants you know that a true

resurrect so a normal resurrection spell

isn't much good unless you have a body

but right which we don't have true

resurrection spell you can resurrect

somebody even if they haven't got

anything so a little bit of dust won't

hurt though okay well I'll take it

anyway yeah yeah so I got that and I got

both his axes that's true

which feel very foreign in my hands yes

yeah we see yeah tricks we got to get

out of here before this place could

still blow up all right I mean let's

just let's just run hey everybody okay

so if you're faster on your staff use

that I will keep on yeah yeah you can

you can hop on your staff and fill the

cathedral up with billowing smoke that's

okay and as you exit the cathedral you

are struck by sunlight bearing down on

you and the gazing eyes of hundreds of

people who have been pushed back away

from the structure having been forced to

evacuate it believing some sort of

explosion or other calamity was going to

strike so all I suddenly turn on you as

you barge out of the Cathedral what do

you do then run it's gonna blow okay

screams that there to stop us so I just

got to get him out of here so the city

wha

despite the city watch's efforts to

contain the crowd it just starts

screaming and people start running

away from the building as quickly as

scrape scores if not hundreds of people

stampeding away with all of their might

and now we can use the cover of this

hysteria to escape ourselves and not be

stopped by city guard being like we're

doing in there or whatever and so how

are you I know how Strix is escaping

probably by rocketing up on the air on

her broom how are you ok I'm away very

fast because this doesn't seem like

people are going to try to intercept me

and stop me or there are there are maybe

a dozen or so city watch constables who

are curious to know more and might

intercede yes

ok Strix could could also polymorph yep

into something you've already got evil

and polymorphed oh that's right after

consummate I'm sorry Scooby a cloud I

feel pretty confident and being able to

slip past them if for some reason I

don't get that I can always take to the

rooftops and run across those but yes

they try to if they look like they're

gonna get towards me I'll just kind of

yell at them uh so throws in sides get a

blow off a guy okay

Sprint's go ahead and make a first of

all just make a deception check for me

where's my deception check what's there

to deceive zanaffar was inside it was

true well six okay and now make a

stealth roll to get out of sight

so that you can basically dart off in a

direction where nobody's watching

question yeah shouldn't question yes

birthday boy real happy birthday to

Jared when it's a reliable talent it's

anything lower than a nine is

automatically treated as a ten making me

look up the robocar check it's got a

nice birthday I've got open eyes have to

know if it's any role lower than Joe

from the book so wait this is a this

isn't in the player sample is it yeah it

should be

oh there it is I see it okay whenever

you make an ability check that lets you

add your proficiency bonus you can treat

on a d20 role of nine or lower as a ten

okay so there you go so was it nine or

lower yeah it was the lowest than it is

a ten okay so even if I roll a natural

one

yep the log I will no longer

automatically fail things I'm proficient

in correct thank God yeah because I was

born this day all right

you guys see the white text but it says

reminder it is not Dee's birthday yes

that's right

jerks yes doesn't get birthdays okay so

with that that's a 24 for self okay yes

you are able to through distraction

through guile and dexterity finagle your

way out of this square without anybody

knowing where you went great okay good

good I guess I'll try to I could see

where Strix is going so I'll just follow

a smoke trail yeah so that's some point

we can kind of reconvene because if you

really have a rendezvous point that's

true we're just moving okay yeah so

Strix you've flown to the city of your

tar no I'm kidding okay

what is your rendezvous point when

you're not using your word of recall

strings oh well I told Dee if we are

going to the black staff tower that's

fair so that's very happy to make me

chase after you the black staff it's not

that far no in fact it's not right

the black staff tower is about two

blocks away south of your current

location all right yeah let's go there

okay okay we have a problem all right

Astra D F when you arrive

Astrix is outside there are crowds of

people running past in the street

heading still heading away from the

spires of the morning right outside of

black staff tower almost as if it's

they're afraid that they're still within

the blast zone well yeah and you can

definitely from here still see the

spires looming high above the structures

to the north huh so this may not be far

away enough if it's not gonna blow is

there a front door there is an entrance

to the black staff tower like might like

much of the tower it is sort of dark and

foreboding strict speak I get further

away right here black stuff tower is

like a fortress in and of itself it's a

big tall blocky structure I know it's

right here but we gotta get further away

this isn't farther Oh for far away

enough evil it could still chase after

Zen with her and catch up to him

she's a snail they magic in there they

can dispel the charm I can't but they

can yeah but on top of that if that

thing is going to explode we're still

too close I mean what it's fine I'll

listen whatever I just I once they know

more than me I can't help anymore

yes you can well we'll come back to them

but right now stay with me and we gotta

keep moving and da like grabbed her by

the hand and like keep trying to go

through the string yeah

oh all right yes so you keep heading

down swords Street as far as you can

pass the number past dozens of

structures block after block after block

until you get like maybe five blocks

away and then you're you know at this

point in time you're not surrounded by

so many panicked people and you know

that would be a pretty big blast yeah

you gonna keep running they gonna stop

at this side

how much time do I have left on that I'm

snail bowling that's an hour so oh it's

an hour whole deck okay so we got plenty

of time yeah yeah yeah okay sure the

charm runs out after yes I'm gonna say

so we can probably keep her a snail

until the charms out yeah yeah okay

that's good that strict Susannah thought

was going to blow up the spires would

you generally say right now is a safe

distance based on what you know about

magic I don't think it's magic I think

it's something else but I can gasps I'm

gonna wait okay you kind of check to

make yeah I mean it's it's it's you know

it's that's 18 you are not familiar with

the explosive power of smoke powder

despite having heard Warrington months

talked about it recently you really

don't have a gauge for just how mighty

it is or how much of it but you do get

the sense that it's the amount of smoke

powder that will determine the extent of

the blast so if it's a ton of the stuff

yeah it could probably leave a fairly

large crater where the building used to

be and in some powerful some powerful

shockwaves out but if it's only like a

keg or two then who knows it might be

like a fireball going off I didn't see

anything that looked like smoke powder

while we were in there there was nothing

there was nothing in the cathedral

itself that indicated or drew your

attention is something that would be

like smoke powder yeah you also came in

through the floor probably notes all

underneath it well you actually recall

now

I don't remember who was there mics it

might have been been Wynn who heard that

so I won't say anything more me yeah so

at this point Strix you're fairly

confident that you're probably not in

harm's way all right yeah we're fine I

guess

I don't know that's good well let's just

take a moment just take a breather we're

okay

okay we're okay sad hmm sorry gonna skip

away from you for a second Jared fine

you are deep under water deep hmm

having descended even farther down than

the sewers of the city into a dungeon

complex that looks ancient and crumbly

from within and your annum you're sort

of in a you've just come down a very

badly preserved stone staircase into a

hall or I guess sort of like a wide

antechamber that's quite long that has a

set of double doors at one end and these

doors are big and circular with a seam

down the middle where they split now

there are handles on the doors that look

like round knobs set into indentations

that kind of have a weird shape to them

but a shape that you have been told is

the symbol of Zenith R which is a circle

with ten spokes radiating outward from

it and above this symbol

sorry above these doors sticking out of

the ceiling of this crumbling stone room

is an iced stock that looks like almost

like a beholder I stock but it's coming

out of the ceiling and just sort of

fixed and staring at you or at least at

the the part of the room that you're

standing in and you don't have long to

look at it but if you want to you can

make an Arcana check I mean sure because

it's weird to see eyestalks coming out

of ceilings I mean normally right I

rolled and it's an intelligence check if

you don't have our corner I rolled a 14

okay

you're not sure what it is but you're

pretty sure it's some sort of magical

surveillance device love's mind and you

don't have to stare at it too long

before those doors open mm-hmm

grind open and a figure pushes its way

through them and just kind of leaves

them open and this figure is an armored

dwarf wearing a big heavy helm with

Minotaur horns mounted on him and as he

stomps into the room he stands there his

great axe still kind of over his back

and he looks at the Greaves on his arms

and says reads them like he's got some

sort of squalls written on them and he

says chosen soul are written I guess he

knows I'm there yeah I'll say speaking

me Margo major domo arigato he says

you're playing for enforcer job yes oh

right Jarl axel head of our little

organization has informed us that

security might be a little lags have I

what heard and no oh hey growl growl bad

not trustworthy and yet you've already

got a few work out for you what's a few

more Naru

recommended you didn't he we are he

recommended me with the highest honours

follow I decided to follow alright

once he you stepped through the doors he

will pull them shut and you see it takes

all of his

muscular dwarven strength to move these

big stone doors and seal them closed but

where he is immediately behind the doors

you can see a curved hallway with

pillars going down the middle of it

supporting a crumbly uneven ceiling and

these pillars have eyes carved into them

all right and even though you think it's

probably more of an optical illusion

than a magical effect the eyes do seem

to watch you as he marches you down the

corridor and it isn't long before you

see a secret door open in one wall and a

goblin come out with a tray doesn't look

like there's anything on the tray maybe

there was at some point but no longer

it's a serving tray and through the

secret door you can see magical lights

and what appeared to be a group of

dwarven mages maybe the roamed with eyes

tattooed on their bald heads sitting

around a glowing circle and murmuring to

themselves the Goblin who appears to be

just some sort of servant is a little

surprised to see you when he turns

around and realizes oh he just opened

the secret door and there are people

here and he just goes and pushes the

door closed and then inches away from

America who you can just see his fists

tensing like he wants to snap this

little goblins neck I don't stop him if

that's what he wants he doesn't quite go

that far but he kind of makes a move

with his head with a hound horns and the

Goblin just shrieks and runs I pointedly

pretended not to notice the secret door

Amerigo looks at you studies you for a

moment

registers that that is what you're

trying to do and just kind of goes yeah

yes

he'll March you down much of this curved

hall and then lead you through a door

into a circular chamber with a big domed

roof that looks like the kind of place

where you would gather a crowd to talk

to them the acoustics are fantastic ok

the only creatures in the room and there

are two other exits on the perimeter of

this big giant circular room standing

near the one other exit that is open is

a small slight drow hmm

disheveled with sort of just a grey robe

hair tangled long matted it looks like

he hasn't put a comb through it in years

beady red eyes just kind of staring off

into space and behind him floating maybe

only three feet away is a creature that

looks like a floating brain with

tentacles hanging down underneath it

okay you recognize being a being of the

Underdark

you recognize this creature as a Grell

hmm they are predatory meat-eaters that

don't generally hang out with civilized

folk right but this one is just floating

behind this drow you would almost say

protectively do I recognize the drought

yes although the last time you saw

actually probably never seen this one

you've probably seen image of him he was

NarL zebron de s-- Naru

the Zanna thar's advisor I remember so I

take it they're both aware that I'm

there as is this dwarf Naru is gazing

off into space like he's so deep in

thought he doesn't even seem to

acknowledge you the girl has no eyes or

any other things that would indicate

it's looking at you yeah but it's a

giant yeah and through the open door

that they're standing just off to the

side of you hear a booming voice say

it's too tight make it looser

city represent her I want her on my team

not in prison hmm family yes connections

and this is just a voice coming out of

the door okay

Amerigo goes waltzing over to that open

door alright no longer really concerned

about you and disappears inside leaving

you in the room with gnarl and the Grell

all right well I sauntered towards

Norrell and I say hey buddy making new

friends he sort of snaps out of a fugue

that he was in momentarily it looks at

you fixes his eyes upon you and then

kind of looks at ghast for a moment like

what you like you just appeared

spontaneously in front of him and he

says just so he heard you needed a

little extra muscle down here yes we do

I hope you impress a gesture to my sword

and because if you don't get the job you

won't leave alive pretty standard drow

operating procedure so I don't let that

faze me you should prepare yourself for

what you're about to see I try not to

show any emotion

few people know what the Zen athough

truly is

good good I'm completely prepared

Amerigo comes back out and says you can

go inside alright I go if you get the

job I'll be out here perfect we gave it

a pointed wink towards normal and then

head inside okay you seen aural as you

walk in sort of dive into his in the

pocket of his robe pull out some papers

and just start sifting through them very

quickly not paying any attention to you

again right like he's searching for a

note or something and as you walk in you

see a another room this one kind of

oddly shaped it looks like parts of it

may have sort of collapsed and been

repaired over the years you really are

in an ancient ancient dungeon complex in

the center of the room is a giant

fishbowl okay about 20 feet across right

and in it you can see all sorts of

terrain and it's full of water and there

is like a little not a little but a

miniature shipwreck inside it and

obviously a much smaller scale model

it's not a real ship but it was built to

look like one and you can see there's

all sorts of coral formations in there

as well and a a golden fish about maybe

a foot and a half two feet long with

regret with some red scales for accent

kind of swimming around in this big fish

tank and then next to it on a small

table is a smaller fish tank sort of

your typical you know I can wrap my pens

fish tank but it's also kind of bowl

shaped and it's also full of water and

it's currently empty hmm and floating

behind them is a beholder mmm a 6-foot

diameter or but with ice docks and it's

pretty low to the ground and there it's

floating near some ladders on which you

can see goblins are perched as they

tighten what looks like an eye patch

over his central eye oh dear hmm and

they're just sort of tightening the

buckles and the straps or rather they're

loosening at this point in time because

he's currently berating them for making

it too tight okay accomplished nothing

in dice camera action other than making

zanaffar into pirate yeah yeah and the

beholder looks at you with its eye

stalks okay and says you're here for an

Oscars job i pointedly avoid looking at

the eyepatch choosing instead to stare

at the eye stalks and say yes mighty

Zanna thar I heard there was an opening

why should I do well Jarl Axl would so

hate to sour our burgeoning relationship

with one of your enforcer spots being

left open that he could easily fill a

dwarf comes out wearing a beanie and

with ten middle I stocks sewn into the

top of it out of felt and you can see

that he has got what looks to be a bowl

in his hands covered with filled with

something almost looks like birdseed or

sawdust or something and he says beanie

time in that voice yeah awesome and he

comes stomping out his little beholder I

stocks jiggling and the zennith are

turns one of his I stock or

levitates up into the air basically

ending his conversation with you mm-hmm

floats above the fish tank and then uses

a telekinesis ray to zap the fish in the

tank lift it out of that tank and put it

into the smaller tank mm-hmm

where it begins to just sort of circle

around frantically as this little dwarf

gets his little stepstool unpacked steps

up into the fish and starts feeding the

fish in the small tank and then the

beholder not paying attention to you

sinks back down to the small fish tank

and he says that's right so God eat up

my fila friend

you're so good there's a big get bigger

yes bigger

and then the beholder his eyes all look

up at you and says you're still here I

am until you tell me who to kill I can

start with that goblin who opened the

secret door in front of me start with

the fish and then he says I am ending my

war against the Centauri a wise move

other concerns now interests me dominate

my thoughts I want you my ears perk up

at the mention of the waffle crew they

have become the bane of my existence

mm-hmm I can see why they are a

dastardly nefarious lot except for

Evelyn I like her all right except for

her no all the time I knew she was the

only good one so you know that many we

had an encounter is he the only one in

the actual universe that calls us the

waffle yes it's because he read the

notes he did read the notes and he says

he gives you an address

on troll skull ally in water deep so

that you can actually pinpoint exactly

where they are he tells you can get up

to their place through the sewers

because they haven't fixed the sewer

hole that his his undead beholder is

made and here he'll make sure that

America who really understood give you

directions that you can follow okay good

I just asked him you want them dead or

brought back interesting I'd like to

kill him myself bring them here of

course but if they become difficult you

might have to kill one of them to make

your point

would you alright I will bring you his

or her head depending on which one

doesn't get the point not even it's not

even it's got it they also have some

children you can bring them to oh okay I

pointed Lee make a long sweeping bow

totally cool with this plan and if

that's why Zenith are I will be to the

killing men alright you can you can see

for the first time sort of standing off

in a shadowy corner a human but you

didn't notice immediately before but you

kind of see it's his distorted features

through the fishbowl and he says well

I'll be on my way back to the city then

alright do i what can I tell what he

looks like or yes you can see that he's

a well-dressed fellow kind of in

Victorian garb but with sort of a big

ruffled collar and the beholder says

to you

this is friend it is my solicitor

solicitor I'd nod respectfully fully

towards prints if you get into trouble

in the city and having to get arrested

friend will help you get out I

completely understand

give him your card friend front will

hand you a card with his address in the

smoker should you need the assistance of

a solicitor who's very well-versed in

the laws of Waterdeep gotcha I pocket

that yes and does the zenith or seem to

be wanting anything else uh he's sort of

settling back into his place where the

goblins can adjust his eyepatch but he

says if you have trouble with evylyn

there's a city Watchmen that she really

likes his name is Todd Todd I don't know

his last name

oh wait according to the notes

it's Todd Gilardi this is their this is

a complex task I don't say that but I am

thinking that the firkins gives last

names for all this and busies safely i

retreat back behind the fourth wall if

he's not as soon as he's not paying

attention to me I politely youthness--

don't fail me he says after you've left

okay they're not even sure he's talking

to you well I'll just assume not

otherwise you might never be back on my

show oh all right I see you change it's

like Christ can't handle two weeks

without breaking the fourth wall and he

doesn't have to like ya in importance

absence yeah so anyway

you are again taking your let out by

Amerigo who who tells you as you make

your way out of this dungeon back going

back the way you went essentially he

tells you a couple things he lets you

know that this dungeon was built by the

nether east wizards which is why it's so

old

okay um he also tells you he has been

here longer than even the zanaffar

and considers this his home and then

confines in you that he likes to call it

Amer goes maze good you know I wholly

indulge

Amerigo in this yes and I'd say it's an

excellent maze and he also tells you

that Nastya has some fairly nice

quarters so if you pass this test and

you get the job you'll be pretty happy

here Oh lovely and then he lets you out

the way you were and he he gives you a

map that shows the path through the

sewers you need to take to get to the

place you need to get to all right well

I take the map and the address and I set

out on my way okay is there anything

else that you want to do before you

leave because Amerigo kind of now trusts

you and kind of leaves you to your your

own business that's uh he doesn't show

you all the way out he just kind of

takes you back to the entry hall and

then abandons you okay uh-hmm

Amerigo I have reason to believe Amerigo

is not that bright he doesn't seem

overly bright no all right I asked him

what Gnarls quarters are like just for

comparison he tells you that Norrell

lives on the lower level of this complex

and that the others don't really like

him around mmm

because nobody nobody trusts him right

in this organization so he he kind of

lives down in an office near where the

zanaffar keeps the corpses of other dead

XANA thar's

that can be animated okay and and sent

out to do his business other dead bee

holders so gnarl is down sort of at the

very very fringe of the zenith ARS layer

and he's got an office there and he

doesn't let anybody inside it and

Amerigo thinks that there's there might

even be like a secret chamber there okay

well I think Amerigo and he overheard

thorvin the Zanna thar's trap Smith and

engineer mentioned that gnarl chose his

quarters because there might be a secret

chamber there I got it well I tell

Amerigo that you know he better go

protect his maze lest someone try to

infiltrate it no one gets past me I'm

Americo I agree that he is a mayor go

all right well I guess that's all my

business with the mayor goes so I'm

gonna head off in the direction of this

map okay and you crawl your way up out

of the Sante thar's lair you make your

way into the sewers of Waterdeep and

head toward your destination DF and

Strix yeah evil ins spell wears off

evylyn you are back in human form no

longer charmed and aware that you were

under a charm effect where you are who

knew where she was a snail I would

imagine yeah I was how was that that was

disorienting I suddenly feel very adrift

and I'm not no longer having my home on

my back and I feel very exposed there

you know I hate that beholder I were

good he's not great no if he so much as

speaks a word

- how how dare he there's been no big

kaboom there people still running no

okay mom that's good to see

that's fine like seething like just as

do you still holding strikes to say at

this point probably anger being angry

and then just like seeing that and then

just being like oh just like immediately

like yeah I think even is like muttering

under her breath about like that no one

no one seems to care what she wants and

who cares maybe she shouldn't want

anything and she's just you know

whatever and then she sees that and

she's she does she goes like a little

smile yes we made it yes

good I'm glad to see you back to normal

I guess

no it's evil am I the statue it was

weird but at least it's I think it's

broken now so that might be less xanthe

are just took it and for whatever reason

you saw did evil in the saw the Sabbath

are basically hurled the statue aside

after that's right people in church when

she showed up yeah yeah sad she was no

one should have made that statue in the

first place anyway as much as I hate

vanitha and I don't think he should have

done any of that it's probably better

that statue isn't there to begin with

now that we can't maybe we took his eye

out I'm thinking that maybe he's gonna

go back to our house yeah he's he's

gonna be mad at us but the kids are

there what Alton I'm sure Paulson's

taking good care of them cut - cut -

paltin in the yawning portal by himself

inside just drinking drinking at the bar

and

occasionally putting his flask down and

just kind of giving Durnan a nod to fill

it the kids not even there it's like the

the fast pan transition back yeah we

have to get back home so you race all

the way back to troll skull alley yeah

along the way

death will explain districts that bid

when obtained some kind of summoning

book that she really wants her to look

at and see if there's anything she can

learn about it and then also if there's

time he has important thing for a while

oh yeah I can walk and talk and look at

the horn thing I mean run and talk

frantically run and talk and look at it

I'm gonna take the helm and like hold I

also have axes that was 25 for the

Arcana checked on the horn okay so and

you've got to date the F has the horn on

him yeah yeah all right

so this magical horn has the property

that when bolon the person blowing the

horn can designate that only one

creature can hear it

Wow so it is a way that the horn can be

used to alert somebody but only that one

person oh so it's a danger horn yes or

secret wine not secret horn yeah secret

danger horn tricks hands it maximizes

its secret danger horn horn I mean it

doesn't for danger there's lots of

secret things you could want to blow

horn about what what what what's more

important than danger well like if I was

like Strix let's have a secret best

friends rendezvous and when you hear the

horn come meet me here then you could do

that I mean that does sound fun yeah

like we could have a best friend secret

rendezvous sometime focus up the

children

just like his running going when you get

back to the Waffle House on trill Scala

alley not much has changed since you've

left other than you can see that in your

absence because the windows are broken

as you walk in like some ravens are kind

of fluttering around inside the taproom

and just kind of perching on this or

that there's one on the mantelpiece and

there's one on a splintered fragment of

the old bar there's one on a windowsill

and then others just sort of flapping

around the room you can also see because

the basement is open and there's a big

hole disintegrated all the way down to

the sewers that rats have sort of come

up in and kind of made their home around

the piles of refuse in the basement as

well as crawled up onto the bar and the

walls and the tables and things there's

actually a rat scuttling under the straw

chair just kind of poking around for any

morsels of food that may have been

scattered in the blast inspectors are

gonna hate this honestly I like him more

you hear the kids upstairs yelling at

each other screaming and romping about

people in answers in in her peppiest

voice that she can but you can you know

you can tell she says it's Paulson here

Paul anyway he's not at the bar even

though there's no alkyl there's no

alcohol that's my policy that's right

he's not here yes exactly

he was always such a good babysitter

before well let's take these kids to

Black's Taft our it's their problem now

we have to get them out of here and fast

NAT comes trotting up to D F and like oh

my god yeah where are the others

[Laughter]

squiggly yeah net go let them know that

that that we need to get you guys out of

here it's for your own safety

tell him quickly all right I'll give her

like 30 seconds before

d/f steps in yeah he comes back out with

like squiggly at the point of her sword

like forward and she just got jinx by

the by the cloak and so he like

backwards and she's just dragging him

he's just like I want a cop willingly

don't use my cloak squiggly will tell

you that jinx somehow managed to turn

waffles into a Manticore that's been fun

if she's this and he's just like same Oh

cosa we need to get waffles hey cousin

do you want to sneak up on them or do

you want your arrival to be are they

there do I do I believe that they're

about to exit out the front door

so it would seem you have you have just

come up through the sewers into their

basement but you can pretty much put

yourself anywhere because they're so

distracted trying to corral what

appeared to be some children running

around I'm in their basement okay but

their basement has no ceiling the

ceiling got blasted out so the basement

is basically just a whole pit yeah

in what look what looks like used to be

some sort of tap room of an old tavern

do you want to know how long we've had

this house Sam has it been like how long

like four days alright and I can hear

them yeah but you're a jerk you're a

drow you're very stealthy so right

pretty much got the jump on them

alright well in that case I'm going to

wait for them mm-hmm

okay with significant amount of distance

between us okay you can see as you wait

that they Corral three children a young

girl a tiefling boy with an eye patch

and a iPad and well you know accidents

happen and Waterdeep and a young boy

dressed like a wizard with a little

stuffed al bear tucked under one arm and

also an owl bear which you realize is a

much older version of an al bear that

youth you thought that they had

previously

they had another albear this one looks

bigger and older than that one okay so

maybe the same one you're not sure I

mean I have an intelligence score of 10

so I'm assuming I probably figure out

that it might be the same at all there

yeah but it's it looks like it's it's

much much much older like you don't know

that the the you know how long all bears

live so alright but this one this one

looks quite old and gnarly ok and when

we called her I think one of us probably

would have called Simon as well yes I

most Simon is with Balto Simon is with

palton okay so you just think that

palton would let Simon no no nope yeah

no Simon's just handing Paulson drinks

from behind

Simon's just sitting on the on the stool

next to sign on next to Paulding

darabond agree and he might be like

turning on the stool like it's kind of

do they have anything to drink around

there no it looks like all everything

included the bar itself and all the

shelves and everything have been blasted

to bits

all right explosion Wow well I'm just

going to put my feet up sit down make

myself comfortable wait for them okay

the rest of you can make perception

jacks I got out of 26 as busy as things

are DF you do see a shadowy figure

sitting in a corner of the blown-out Tap

Room with his feet up this he

strategically chosen a place out of

direct light yeah just kind of like

noting that sensing it it's in me like a

snap look over in that direction and

like kind of hand towards his sword not

quite pulling it out yet but just more

like looking over handing the sword and

his

being like who's there I very pointedly

gesture with my sword 'less hand and say

hey buddy

Chozen it was I was D D F wasn't it how

are you friend I was there customer do

they want to pie - I have a sponsor now

I would love all right so let's go into

the kitchen I hate this and what are you

doing here well I say well and you know

what are you doing here last I saw we

had an iron flat together full of a fire

elemental last I saw you're too busy

concentrate on yourself to worry about

the lives of others

mmm yeah point taken

I won't beat around the bush that's

pretty much what I'm here for again

though in fairness it might benefit the

lives of others there's no reason why we

can't work together this time yeah we

worked together last time - we did so

but last time we were only dealing with

fire Giants you've uh you've made

yourself some new enemies and it means

that I'm haven't you do you want to hear

the last to hear from the kitchen no she

doesn't want to hear the list really all

right

specifically one big enemy with a lot of

eyeballs got to be more specific I'm

sorry big enemy with a lot of eyeballs -

one big eyeball oh yeah the one in love

with Evelyn yeah guy who is very aware

of where you live and the fact that you

have children

and uh you know probably of where you're

going to go to why can't we just why

can't we just have a home just once and

maybe like protect our family why can't

we just maybe once just have you know

why can't it just be uncomplicated

why can't you no no I have to get

freakin charmed by a beholder that

apparently I assume Melinda's rambles on

like that for good Wow do you think oz

will continue to counter keeps yelling

really depressing things like well evil

in life is tragedy I don't know why

we're even still alive I thought I was

in the dead book years ago but you know

I watched your heads get chopped down

she goes like that for a while it's just

like watch your heads get chopped off

you just hear this cleaver go trunk ends

up lying on the floor with her hands

folded like talking at the same time as

strict yeah more negative Strix is the

more positive part like chop the the

mushroom cap off its stem and there's

ghosts Poppins head and yeah if just

says God you've proven your point you

already know he's been someone who knows

more than they should what is it that

you want

Oh much just a dead body one that I

think you might be able to help me get

and if in exchange for that you get

these anethe are are now semi-blind

friend to leave you and your young

Ward's alone well that seems like a good

deal doesn't it you're asking me to

murder someone no no

no I'm sure the sword you have there is

purely for decorative purposes

it talks oh wow I refrain from looking

from appearing impressed because I'm

sure if he needs a dead body I think we

still have some down there a specific

dead body one who won't be missed and

who I can assure you is wholly evil hmm

it only works of evil and evil sense

works on them and then she'll kill

anyone well we can go check if you want

but he's going to end up dead all the

same so why not benefit from it look I

love dialogue and I think it's like very

artful but I've just had like a real

long day and I'm wondering if you could

just tell us who this person is that you

want to kill and why you know just

another drow who has decided to aid your

enemy we have reasons for wanting him

dead

and you have reasons for wanting this

Ameth are to leave you alone I can

easily show you how to get achieved one

of those then I'll take care of the

other one well we don't know any other

drow so that's right you don't well you

won't have to meet him I'll do we can do

it entirely from behind if you would let

me rephrase that you won't even have to

dirty your hands just help me

isolate him from the rest of the Zanna

Thor's defenses and you're saying that

somehow this will make the Santa Thor

leave us alone

the Zenith are has a fish I don't

pretend to know what goes through a

beholders mind where he might like a

fish but he seems especially attached to

this one it has its own little

underwater Kingdom in a massive bowl the

whole thing is really quite tasteful but

it gets transferred to a small bowl for

feeding time if you can get that fish

does anethe are will accede to whatever

demand you want he'll leave you alone

he'll forget you even exist and while

we're down there I'll just happen to

take care of some business that you

won't even have to worry about I'm sorry

you want us to steal his fish

technically kidnap the fish because

stealing implies that it's property and

I think he views this as more than

property I understand that I would do

anything for my pets yeah but you know

his pet I'm sure his pet is equal to hmm

can't the cold fish be evil well

spending that much time around him you

know it's a whole nature versus nurture

thing that we don't have time to get

into but are we even sure it's a

goldfish

it could be a polymorph to like person

it looked to be having a great time it's

not a goldfish it's more like a carp

about a foot long maybe two feet like a

koi one and a half feet long to two feet

long Goldy scales has some red flecks

really he takes excellent care sound

like it could even be evil to me well

whatever the point is fish is so

important to zenith our and must be

nearby I'm are kept under watch all the

times how would you ever expect us to be

able to kidnap it

well you encountered him didn't you you

didn't see any fish then

East currently scouring the city looking

for you all you have to do is convince

him you're somewhere else and then just

disarm traps kill whatever evil person

he is watching the fish and then there

you go

uh can I bring him as pie now I really

appreciate that it's very nice and

steamy and it looks great super taste I

asked how much I owe

oh no oh it's on the house for not

killing us when I didn't see you in the

shadows okay sure go ahead

well I'm giving him the pie roll the one

I just can't see anything past my baking

skills isn't that weird no dieter that's

not weird at all all right I'll go get

waffles while this happens okay cousin

you've also been one have always

obtained and retained a lot of Secrets

not this time

if we did do this what's in it for you

what business are you trying to

accomplish i sigh deeply and say after

our little adventure in which you'll

remember I pointed Lee sided with you

over my own kin I found myself at odds

loose ends and possibly being hunted by

my former companions so i shacked up

with a little mercenary company and in

an effort to prove what a team player i

am it turns out the drow in our in the

santa thorez employ might not be

remembering who's signing his paychecks

as it were paychecks are something we

use in the end

currency outside of hard fiscal debts

it's a drought thing economic system

extremely refined he might not be

remembering who's paying to keep his

rooms clean bright and how exactly would

you know about this Hosanna Thoris and

that he's after us and knows where we

are I saw it

he thinks I'm working for him but it's

very simple while pretending to be in

the employ of a half-blind beholder I

saw his giant fish that I want you well

how many guys you counted ten i stocks

all fully functional he is missing his

main eye but the big one is maybe worth

a little more person yeah I was gonna

say so don't worry about it doing about

the semi-blind beholder believes I am

working for him in an attempt to kill my

old associate to ingratiate myself with

my new associates as a fish that I would

like you to kidnap so that you can use

that fish to leverage the Santa thar

into leaving you alone or whatever you

happen to do with that fish I'm not here

to judge well considering what I know

about the Santa thar and his trouble

with boundaries he's probably not a

great fish parent to begin with so

exactly you can't add I'm fairly certain

if for some reason we were able to

obtain this fish and then use it as

ransom and threaten the zanaffar the

last thing he's ever going to do is

leave us alone or something so egregious

you can easily just escape the city and

give him his fish back then he won't

pursue you beyond water deep

but we just got back to Waterdeep well

we just want to have our nice house we

can just live and be happy

squiggly says when you see a bully

punch him in the nose that's a good idea

I think we should punch the Santa Thor

in the nose if he has a nose he does not

squiggly looks confounded for a moment

well what I guess constricts come down

with waffles at this point sure okay yes

come down waffles as Couzens finishes

off his pie you realize the last person

you've had a pie to is dead now she just

gets really depressed like genuinely sad

like he was dust but you know it's fine

waffles is here so okay so the plan is

apparently that we kidnap this fish and

we are but then what's because you know

do we just keep the fish and threaten

him forever or that's up to you I don't

think he would be cool with that I don't

think you would either another thing I'm

not cool with Couzens is that well

frankly at least from my own

observations you seem to have something

of a reputation for betraying those

you've made deals with technically I

only have betrayed family and business

associates and we are neither

all I'm offering is a mutually

beneficial deal that will get theirs

anetha off your backs and let me do a

quick errand I mean I want to rescue

that poor fish no now that I know it

exists yeah the gift turns towards Strix

and evylyn and just as well make things

worse for you than it already is

that's true he's coming after us one way

or another and if we want to stay and

not run we got to do something

it could also very well be a trap you

villain he's obsessed with you

no I feel like getting you that much

closer to him is that is very dangerous

especially with what he did to you last

time yeah I'm sure I liked Diaz and I

can just go down there and steal the

finish cuz like no magic and he keeps

like no one sees him like half the time

and then you can take all the kids

someplace safe and make sure that the CR

doesn't get them cuz he's probably gonna

want to take anything that's important

to us including kids robot sons waffle

bears owl bears

palton how Paulson's gone he probably

take Dalton look this he's probably got

a pulse it right now he took one of the

most important things that I have and

that's my own choice

and I can't run from that my whole life

I need to look him in the eyes he has

left and then cut them off I raised the

remnants of my pie to that maybe I mean

we maybe we could poison him you could I

want him to know why well while he's

dying you can tell him why yes and I

will then tell him that he is going into

the dawn of a new light and that

Lysander will guide him in a new way

that is not something else you know Sam

or something the cozen knows based on

the competition with Amerigo is that if

as an authority holder usually arrives

shortly thereafter to take its place I

choose not to share that okay what I

know that having lived in water deep

that long no that is not great we're

gonna kill them and it's gonna be over

and everything it's not that simple

no we just have to get his goldfish I

think that should be our plan

killing him is gonna be way too hard and

we'll all end up dust and I don't want

to be in the dead book because of that

stupid booty beholder who says weird

words and names things that seem too

esoteric

for even the magic that I know think

you're ready like the Perkins you're

right chosen are you also trying to say

to us that you also know how to find

this fish where to get it the best time

to strike and kidnap it mostly I can

lead you to the Zanna thar's lair I

can't tell you if there's anyone being

watched while you're there but I do know

the Santa thar's lair has a system of

secret doors and I know where at least

one of them are is all right which gives

you better than average odds of getting

in there and are you yourself going to

be there to assist us getting this fish

absolutely come on cozened df2 the end

in sight I don't think I have to look I

already know this is gonna go down to

Sue's bruh there you're gonna sneak off

and do your own thing fine I accept that

but if you really think if we can get

this fish and I'll get the zanaffar to

just leave us alone plus he was pretty

egregious against evylyn and all of us

it's not about revenge it's about making

sure he never does that to anyone else

ever again it's the principle and

leaving us alone and you have evidence

even all of you that he's done it to

others

tulip the the orphan had had this had a

similar effect on her

goddammit are we doing this oh we're

doing this actually you're not quite

sure if you said it out loud or not

you're just there with your five I make

a check to make sure I'm not wringing my

hands all right well how do we plan

because we know he's got those raise so

like do we need to carry like big

mirrors and like mirror them back at him

or something or like interestingly

enough Strix actually took an ice doc

she did that had been cut off of nazca's

head and so she hasn't had a chance to

look at that yet to see if anything can

be gleaned from it about properties of I

rays and whatnot yeah she will she will

she's gonna look at it and see if at

least like maybe she could alter

counterspell or find some sort of like

like potion or something that could keep

them from getting disintegrated or or

charm that's gonna take a little bit of

time you can't just do that like you

can't pull out your mallet and

immediately gleam that but if you go up

to your you know upstairs workshop and

you think about it and you do some tests

you might be able to come up with

something yeah where we go anywhere do

anything we have a bit of research

reconnaissance and information gathering

that we have to do mm-hmm

and you're gonna wait right here with us

where we can see you and I got a look at

this and she like flings the iStock

around and like splashes some goop

everywhere um it's not a good hand

gesture or noise absolutely happy to

just wait here for a bit okay good

so what would you like to do next so

what I want Strix to be able to look at

this ice talk and learn as much as you

can about the holder we have a workshop

montage where yeah he's trying out all

kinds of things on this sample so it's

got that I also want to give her this

strange demon book that I receive from

Ben win I wanted to look at that as well

see if that means anything to her oh we

also want to if there's time and once

things have calmed down take the remains

of bidden when - maybe the spires and

see if there's anything they can do for

the hero that saved their entire temple

even would go with him when he did that

and she would also spend the workshop

montage finally kind of really trying to

figure out what this shield was that she

got gifted that she's kind of been

carrying around and not having time to

figure out what exactly it does okay and

she's taken that where the shield she's

during the workshop montage she's like

sitting on the floor while Strix is

working and like trying to figure out

the shield

well Strix will just grab it from her

and be like wow I got a 20 for doing the

same montage chosen India they're

sitting at the same table across Mucho

there was like a single mug between them

not saying a word with just a palpable

tension your PI's appear don't you don't

worry about that Anna your shield first

of all it is a plus one shield so it

will increase if you we have it will not

only give you the benefit of the shield

which is a two bonus to your AC but also

increase it by another 1/3 about it yes

in addition you can alter the outward

surface of the shield to take on

different expressions

because it's a face yes yeah what does

the face look like I'm gonna leave that

up to you

oh okay so it's an emoji she is now the

great emoji I think I've heard of this

spell caster is that all yes those are

his properties well even is like a

little sad because she feels like she

looks cool when she cuz her shield is

her bracers you know Wonder Woman but

when she knows when she finds out she

can in MO and Strix get scared with its

happiness like oh god I should have

never told her that that's gonna be

stupid it's a big smile yes so Strix

you're upstairs in your workshop and

you're doing your operating on the I

stock DF & Co Center down in the tap

room once you've realized the power of

your shield evil and what do you do then

[Music]

she makes the moji with the extra-long

frog she's like leave get out I've tried

to do work that will actually save us

the shield is just gonna annoy the

cinnabar crab during this chosen India

thar may be it going over logistics of

approaching how we get there etcetera

okay yes obviously you'll be diving down

deep underwater deep because I saw yep

exactly right

you can also regale if you are so

inclined Couzens you can tell Phil

deaath and exactly everything that you

saw or not everything that you saw just

particulars that you saw like maybe some

of the individuals that you met or some

of the creatures that you encounter I'll

tell him that you know under the once

you get past the sewers there's a maze

with a dwarf who seems to think he's a

Minotaur wandering around it uh I don't

he's not actually a Minotaur so I don't

think he actually he doesn't seem that

bright so he might not actually know how

to get through that yeah there's an

authority bring in the best and the

brightest so right know would you expect

the best the brightest to work for him

Oh actually if there's infirm

are you gonna mention anything about the

surveillance system there are ice docks

poking out of the walls and it's a safe

bet that anything that's they see those

anetha also sees but then again there's

just a lot of like guys aren't magic

really eyes are a theme fairly frequent

theme a motif a real a real

dacor okay well as long as you know

where these survelliance high stocks are

absolutely we'll make our way around

those all right Strix you think first of

all making our kana check as you are

taking this I stock apart and put mixing

it with other compounds and looking at

it under a magnifying lens that's an 11

okay

you think it could be useful you're just

yeah you're not sure you have everything

you need

oh wait you know what I can use oh I'm

gonna use my divine thing I have the

skill hold on it's called divine thing

it's called favored by the gods once

first progressed if you fail a saving

throw we're miss with an attack role or

like I guess do badly I don't know miss

or saving but I'd be saving for it's an

ability check so does that does it say

ability just feel with a saving through

our mister you can roll to d4 and add it

to the total possibly changing though it

does not know well I tried dice the gods

do not show you her favor

just blow chunks inside yeah and you

sort of destroyed about half of the I

stock at this point it's probably

because at one point I was just like

like this like I was holding it was like

like maybe just like eight a little lot

of it just to like see if maybe that

would give me some insight yep didn't

and I wrote I didn't roll on us you're

also distracted by the fact that this

crow has sort of intruded upon you and

just sort of perched on something he

just sort of glaring at you oh yeah if I

was like trying to like maybe eating the

I stock and then was like oh I'm like

through bits at em and then I realized

I'd already fed him half of it all right

and so while you're struggling with that

assist Rick's a bag goes over your head

and tightens and then suddenly you are

beaten by some unseen threat I'd like

you a hellish rebuke I'd like you to

roll initiative first of all it's even

too far away to hear that now yeah she

strikes his upstairs by herself in her

room that's a five okay so yeah you get

absolutely your head completely covered

in what you now realize it's probably

like a pillowcase mm-hmm and then you

are assailed with what feel like clubs

and although they they sort of beat on

you and it almost feels like three

different creatures or beings are

whaling on you with these clubs uh-huh

you're like it must be the kids no but

they're hitting they're hitting about as

hard as kids - uh-huh

but none of them do any appreciable

damage to you as they attempt to

basically beat you unconscious

uh-huh and now would you like to use

your

if it's like kids then I'm just gonna

turn into a cloud okay and just be

materialized out of the bag like excuse

me Oh remind media if you gave you your

stress tricks in the book right yes

because I want her to look at it yes all

right so you turn into a cloud Strix the

pillowcase that sort of falls through

you and as you look around you can see

what appeared to be like three chair

legs suspended in the air by what must

be invisible people or beings uh-huh

it's the invisible then you realize it's

the unseen servants I'll turn oh I like

I mean I want to talk to them because I

don't understand why this is happening

so I'm gonna turn back into myself and

be like excuse me they start whacking

they start one of them actually rolled a

13 that's probably not enough that you

right

I had mage armor on so no I got 44 so

yeah it bounces off you can hit me see

the energy field of your mage armor

spark as it strikes and you take no

damage and they are they are trying to

beat on you okay I'm just like what why

what do you want what's bad is there a

bad thing in here what do you want they

don't answer me they don't seem to have

that capacity

I'm so mad do you want to do anything

else besides scream at them and by the

way the rest of you can hear Strix

upstairs is screaming this is not

uncommon no it sounds like she might be

screaming at the kids but yeah she just

scream help yeah the kids go help yeah

you the other the rest of you can sort

of see that the kids are kind of in the

kitchen messing around in there okay and

as Strix

screams for help suddenly the kids also

scream for help

oh no oh come on evylyn was going for

strikes yeah it was like right next to

the kids so I think she'd stop to see if

they were okay because there are a

little more defenseless right okay

evylyn goes to the kitchen where do you

go

Cozens drugs yes d/f goes restricts

lifts goes the earth is running away it

goes very fast very fast

hmm I'm just going to sauntering yes I

mean that's true I'm waiting okay

evylyn when you walk to the kitchen you

see the kids are sort of cowering behind

a counter sort of scooby-doo style like

one on top of the other as the unseen

servants are throwing knives at them and

it's very clear that these these

servants are trying to kill these kids

Oh evil interference our shield to the

very mad emoji not just the slightly

scolding one the like very like I

genuinely imagine that it has an emoji

face on does it have the thing over its

mouth with all the characters like and

and and tries to block the blows and

also so you're interposing yourself

uh-huh and also she's like what is wrong

with you you are supposed to serve this

house okay so you stand in front of the

kids with a shield up you can hear

things bouncing off your shield knives

being thrown other things being thrown

sharp objects of all kinds they are not

responding to you at all these are

friends they live here we live here

jinkx is like don't worry I can do on7

bomb and he like sticks his wand like

from not

just like fur around the shield right

just around the back the side of the

shield and dance it around James turns

to a little like oh like a little heart

eyes thanks just roll a d20 for me

that's a four okay so you're trying to

dispel them mm-hmm okay

you wave your wand around a streak of

magic leaps out strings around one or

Springs around them all or at least one

of them and they just sort of implodes

nice and is gone and your other Lea

convinced that you've done something but

nobody else sees it I love that because

whenever I play Jenks I feel successful

so thank you that's great Jenks is like

I know magic meanwhile upstairs tricks

having your there still got chair legs

and are trying to beat on you as they're

talking to you what do you do

I remember strix recalls to let these

unseen servants out all she needs to do

is erase that rune on the door right so

strikes is like yeah there they've gone

rogue I'm just like all right down the

stairs but Sergei is probably like zooms

past Deus only so you would have in

since they're in this room in this this

part of the room all you have to do is

go to the doorframe of this room and

look for the room there okay that's what

I'm doing I'm like I'm like baby I'm

yelling like they've gone rogue make a

perception check to see if you can find

the rune on this door d/f you see Strix

standing in a doorway looking at the

doorframe for something as chair legs

are trying to beat her up the head and

back I'm so very confused and then a

broom comes at you like it was just

waiting for you to come through the door

and you see these bristles come alright

but you expertly duck out of the way

whacks up against the wall and misses

and searches like now it's true enemy

everybody else I've already got an

initiative roll four straight so

everybody else rolled me an initiative I

think Chris it's my birthday

ten okay evylyn nine nine and cozen

nineteen Couzens you're making your

leisurely way up the stairs you you get

to this sort of common room where

deaaath is currently engaged in a

pitched battle against what appears to

be a flying animated broom you know I

tweeted today that DFC past catches up

to him is anything coming at me and I'm

sorry Strix what was your perception

role it was o my perception roles 13

okay that is enough Strix to realize you

can find the rune its tiny just etched

into the door and all of the rooms

basically look the same but it's very

very clear this one has been recently

altered well I'm pissed for one I'm like

change then you can just hear like

yelling about it and the Couzens you

hear that what do you do uh like

nothing's coming at me right oh no

alright I just sort of look at ya and

say you got this buddy he's not immortal

well now now the pointy end of the broom

is coming at him and there's a pointy

end so someone who's been like carbon

[Laughter]

sorry the the bristle list end of the

broom whatever it's called comes @df and

tries to stab him through the mouth but

death it rolled a whopping horrible the

world a whopping 11 so it misses you

yeah well that's been this point I'm

quite the expert of yes ruling with

brooms indeed and it's your turn well

Strix definitely it was like that it's a

brown again she's like trying to scrape

it off you could see her doing it

I can't attack a broom because all it

does is make a broom in a stick that's

true

and you know that this thing is being

this broom is being wielded by an

invisible servant so yeah and even

though you can't see it you kind of know

what space that's occupying you'll be a

disadvantage because it's invisible to

hit it yeah I can't attack unseen

servants I don't think I don't know

magic I've never never tried I still try

to command it I tell it to stand down

and what's gotten into you it's cetera

we are the merit my father's house Wow

it does it does a little twirl with the

broom like it's getting ready to rear up

and attack you again

ah heck I uh I really like to try to

grab the broom okay I'm the servant that

you can do make a strength check just

rolled in at 20 but but this thing is

actually pretty weak so it's got a

penalty okay the the super super weak

unseen servant rips the broom out of

their grasp starts just like chuckles a

little all right and then evylyn you're

in the kitchen being assailed amount

muscled by something that doesn't have

muscles thank you I guess

so even wouldn't have understood the

rune thing because she's not with strict

so I guess I want to have her do like a

an Arcana check to see if she knows why

sure oh she actually did good for once

um 19 the unseen servants are not meant

to behave this way you think that

something has gone haywire with their

magic no their magic has neither been

altered or something something has

happened to affect the way their normal

magical behavior and I did overhear this

stuff about the runes and like know that

that's kind of what yeah you saw acorrea

walking around with Strix when she was

describing the runes yes yeah you also

know because these are magical effects

they can be dispelled

so dispel magic could get rid of one you

also you also know evylyn that when the

taproom blow up the servants in that

room were destroyed by the blast that

suggests to you that damaging them is a

possibility or maybe it was because the

ruin was destroyed you're not sure yeah

and I think she'd like she doesn't want

to wreck the house she's like if it's

pretty sure if you were to deface or

destroy the ruin you'd probably destroy

the unseen servants that are held bound

by it and when she looks at the rune she

doesn't have any like understanding of

how to fix no no strikes she just keeps

defending okay she doesn't want to like

ruin them but obviously I've got it I

got it alright but you are able to very

adroitly protect the kids so they're not

in any danger as long as you're guarding

them

now what would not do Anna

take she froze oh she froze okay well

Anna's frozen by some powerful spell

that's terrible

so we'll hold off on the whole nap

question for a moment and it comes down

to the unseen servants tricks they're

going to accost you again two of them

actually hits you this time Oh 4 4 & 3 a

total of 7 points of damage

wow these are bruises make it make a

perception check 17 okay whilst you are

being assailed you see that crow then

raven turn into a red skinned devil cat

grab the book and fly out the window

well that's what you hear as the crow

flies out really loud you recognize it

of course as an imp yeah I do

it takes the book up into its arms and

then just flaps out the window with it

did I even get a chance to look at it

you saw it when it turned into its

normal form just before oh no no cuz you

were busy with the I all right well I'm

mad and it is your turn all right after

I scream I fed you snacks I just like

are the servants still attacking me yes

okay I just start scraping off the room

like so you're scraping off the room

completely like just okay as you as soon

as you can't carve away and destroy the

ruin those table legs just fall clatter

clatter clatter clatter onto the floor

around you all right I'm gonna use bowel

matter G to yell sweep the road off

soco's and you're like standing in the

doorway and you're like oh yeah there's

tiny little ruin inscribed Justin's on

the inside of the door frame right there

you wouldn't see it how the door was

closed but Oh am I being attacked nope

good it's not my house

I don't wanna see this being accosted by

a broom he looks up she goes Oh Anne are

you with us yes sorry that's okay it

happens did not want to do anything

while defended by evylyn shield or she's

just gonna hang back with the other boys

mmm I think she will also take up a

defensive stance in front of the boys

the behind II one okay great

that makes perfect sense and if if a

knife or something did happen to get

past evil and her goal would be to smack

it out of the sky with her sword Anna

you were disconnected when the the Raven

that Strix was feeding turned into and

grabbed what turned into an imp and then

grabbed the infernal book and flew out a

window while Strix was being assailed by

unseen servants you know I fed you

snacks and very angrily and everybody

here is I fed you snacks echoing

throughout the entire building and yes

just thinking you can't feed on seeing

servants cozen it's your turn you see

you see DF made a grab for the broom got

his hands on it but then it was wrenched

away all right so I see that there's a

room here yes and I was just I heard

Strix

say destroy the room yep all right well

you know since I want to be a team

player

I'll start scraping off that room as you

do the broom Falls well there you go I

have successfully saved you from a booth

already this partnership is beneficial

yeah what do you do you just give him

one deer just looks at his kids and well

he's just and then he walks past him to

find strikes yeah you sort of step over

the broom and head over towards strix

who is standing there surrounded by

chair legs you can see beyond her is her

workshop there's some horrible smells

coming out of that's because she's been

experimenting on the beholder eye and

through the smog and the haze you see an

open window with some sort of billowy

drapes thrown open yeah and she's like

shaking her staff out the winner going

why you took the bucket stuck that was

mine she's just like shaky her staff no

because she's not being attacked anymore

nope right strikes what happened in the

kitchen evil in all of the accoutrements

that are being hurled on or held up just

grating ready to be thrown at you fall

or stop at that moment and then the

unseen servants actually your rune is

still intact so they're still going to

attack you but this time one of them

actually picks up a chair and tries to

smash you with it this is not the time

for chair fight but you block it drags

you would have heard her say to erase

the rune she yelled in salma Church we

can get them back I'd yell again okay

even we'll try to erase the rune okay

now see if you that'll you have to go

across the kitchen to the door to the

tap room which means you won't have the

kids with you you want the kids to be

with you as you make your way over to

the door okay so you kind of use the

shield almost like a protective umbrella

move them around the room in such a way

that they're never in direct line of

sight with the unseen servants until you

get to the door and then you're like

okay there it is there's the room what

are you gonna try to do it so they can

be heroes there you go Oh totally evens

like I need your help

I can't stop this brutal attack erase

that rune or were toast I can do what I

do magic good Jake sees how far up it is

and he's like yeah maybe one of you

should call my office

NAT climbs on on jinxes shoulders and

use her sword to try to scrape it off

squiggly is actually gonna take a shot

at one of the unseen servants a

disadvantage because yeah he would do

that he would totally do that all right

that one didn't go so well so good shot

though and yeah and he tells his friends

to hurry up and nat you scratch away the

rune with the tip of your sword until

there's really no not much trace of it

there's just a gouge in the door where

it used to be and then the unseen

servants are gone thank goodness what

would I have done without you here you

are heroes dia Strix these children are

heroes more heroes that looks very proud

of herself and walks up to districts

yelling like really really proof like

really like inappropriate language out

the window okay

tearing that Kia so to say thank the

gods that they were here we shall reward

them as so very soon in a minute not

right now KO's in you have no idea I

picture like waffles is like in the

middle of the tap room just like licking

our bits like mostly just hang out did

the house go all crazy you can you can

still hear strict snowing like pie cough

like every like planar curse word but

thankfully no one knows and the kids

don't have to plug their ears sorry

death

it's gone and it's out of sight yeah

yeah well a nip stole a book that was

obviously written and infernal that I

didn't get a chance to read because I

was trying to look at the eye stock and

I fed it some of it and I thought it was

a kind gesture and then it left

evylyn you you know that imps are fiends

I don't like those why can i in sight

check out stew like anything that I

might infer from the fact that a fiend

and imp tol this book I get a 12 well

you know that imps are a minor kind of

devil fairly weak in the hierarchy but

useful they're often used as messengers

servants of more powerful evil beings

and they sometimes service familiars to

powerful evil wizards you also know that

they're as part of the nine hells

they're a part of the infernal hierarchy

and they also speak infernal which is

the language in which that book was

written my divine sense can locate or at

least identify fiends but could it like

locate one yeah you can you can sort of

use it to bear down on the fiends

location if you activate the power don't

worry I'll find it well that's it dance

it might be going to something that's

more trouble than it's worth

honestly like it was probably just a

book on how to like cook bean pie or

something I don't know

I mean let's just call her up again if

it showed up to take that book back that

means someone wants it for a reason if

it's this infernal that means they can't

have it

evylyn goes fast as you can you can

probably catch up to it but if it gets

too far away there's going toward

something far more dangerous you pull

back okay go Strix go before before you

get too far Strix you also know or sorry

evylyn actually you probably with your

twelve we probably wouldn't know that so

so evil in your plan is your plan is

just to basically rock it out here on

your wound wing to boots

search of this imp yeah are you just

tracking it or gonna try to track it

visually is that your plan no in my

divine sense so you're activating your

divine sense when are you activating

your divine sense immediately or when

you get outside as i as i zoom out the

window okay and what is the range of

your divine sense it's there something

bad in our house fast and can it be

it looks like sixty feet of you yeah

okay when you get out of the house and

you activate your divine sense you

detect eight fiendish auras and they're

all in your house and that's what'll

stop Kosan how fiendish are you that's

true yes this is a devil problem yes

infestation an infernal station because

you killed one of them I'm gonna I'm

gonna pick up the broom yeah sort of

wave it so a quick quick question Sam
