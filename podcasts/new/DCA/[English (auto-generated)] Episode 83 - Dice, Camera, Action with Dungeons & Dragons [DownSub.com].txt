you

hi welcome to dice camera action i

SuperDuper D&D campaign that was great

featuring the waffle crew yeah so

previously in dice camera action the

waffle crew what was separated and they

still are because one of their members

got a powerful artifact called the ring

of winter and ran off into the shadow

fell with it taking his severed hand and

his this Skull chalice from a tomb the

rest of the party wanting to keep the

waffle crew whole went in after him and

so paltin is off on his own with the

ring of winter now in this rundown old

tavern in the shadow fell called the

dead I'd drunk while the rest of the

party is making their way in that

direction

guided by Simon Paul tins marionette son

yes the crew also in count the the

three members of the waffler also

encountered a man on a horse named Lord

Nile who apparently had his he and his

family had suffered a terrible fate at

the hands of two shadow Kai assassins

that have now befriended paltin and are

with him at the tavern a couple quick

notes Miranda is suffering from a

terrible case of apathy as a result of

her exposure to the shadow fell and as a

consequence she doesn't she doesn't

believe that she can make a difference

anymore nothing if she does is important

anymore to anybody or anything

whereas deaath and evylyn have a

different form of despair they can't

tell in their madness what's real and

what's not anymore and Strix is

basically the same she wants to die more

she's full of dread even more so than

ever before she doesn't want to die she

thinks she's going to die there's

French yeah but but when she thinks

she's going to die she just has like

this

resolute feeling of just well I guess

this is it yes yes so the shadow fella

is this bleak dreary wasteland of sorts

that seems I've had all the color and

life leached out of it and as the party

is making their way along it several

days are gonna pass you're all gonna be

up to your maximum hit points you'll

have all your spell slots and whatnot

there is the matter of waffles that we

should talk about in the last episode

waffles was turned into a chick baby yes

because it aggressively attacked Miranda

in it's madness thinking she was

somebody else or some kind of threat

what do you want to think about what you

want to do with waffles for a moment

also a significant amount of time has

passed in your journeys I've been pretty

ambiguous about this but for purposes of

the death curse it's important to track

so DF and Strix you are still sharing

that one ring you have right yes yeah

sure okay in that case you your maximum

hit points each dropped by 16 I'm so mad

right now

Paul Caen paltin so you have the other

ring you're fine okay oh gee all right

great great paltin hmm it is a cold cold

morning you wake up in the cot upstairs

in the run-down tavern you go over to

the dresser and you look into the mirror

you've done this over several days now

possibly even weeks maybe even months

you're not sure the shadow fell doesn't

change much so days and nights are

meaningless here it's pretty much just

gray and dreary all the time

so you're not sure how much time has

passed but boy have you changed as you

look into your reflection you see that

your hair has turned black like almost

the color of Raven feathers and you

haven't eaten in what must be weeks and

so you are a little bit more drawn and

thin than before but your skin has also

kind of taken on a bluish tinge

you don't seem bothered at all by the

cold enough never bothered me anyway

your hair or your black hair has also

grown out about a month or two of growth

you're not exactly sure and as you just

gaze at this stranger looking back at

you you can hear outside laughter it

sounds like Narayana and levar doe are

having a good ton of fun oh I'll go out

there and hang with my my new friends

see what they're up to

you plod down the creaky old steps to

the tap room you are narayana and levar

doe eight the innkeeper mmm sixteen

seventeen days ago because there's no

food you're also you're out of ale and

out of wine so das over that last one

was the real problem so yeah you go

outside in front and you're greeted by a

familiar snowscape everything is

blanketed in thick thick snow and you

can see that levar doe and nurse Deanna

have gotten into a snowball fight

having built or having finished building

what appears to be the last of about a

hundred snowmen all around the hills of

this domain a while mm-hmm huh

but yes there they're sort of throwing

snow at each other their mood has

vacillated over the period that you've

gotten to know them they're at times

very cheery and at other times morose

this is a very cheery time for them and

when they see you they're easy Anna

throws upper arms after the air looks

around at the domain and shouts in there

no I feel like I agree but I'm not sure

what that means you see some movement

off to the side and no that's meathook

he's still tethered to their wagon which

has now got this thick layer of snow

both on top of him and on top of the

wagon you can also hear the tavern

groaning under the weight of the snow

that's sort of piled up on the roof the

winter wind that blows through causes

the twig glyphs that hang from the eaves

of the tavern to rattle and clatter

around together they in the wind and

you're and you're yelling friend seem to

be pretty much the only signs of only

sounds in this desolate place but

everything's looking pretty much the

norm out here now yep okay I will snow

as far as your eye can see

hmm safe all right looks good out here

now uh go back inside

all right make a perception check okay

13 as you go back as you turn around to

go back inside

the you don't see anything you don't

hear anything but levar dough does sort

of walk up behind you and he says so I

think we are ready for your friends but

and he sort of stops for a moment and

thinks about his words very carefully so

as not to offend you but have you

considered how we are going to killing

the ones on the ground will be easy of

course but what about the ones who can

fly what are we going to do about them

and you hear Narayana shout oh sadly yes

yes yes but details how are we going to

kill the flying ones well do you have

anything for flying friendos and not so

much okay maybe you could NASA work with

the ring to make us something that flies

it's not a horrible idea I'll uh I'll

consult with the ring like so any

thoughts on this matter and he says I am

sure inspiration will come to you hmm

and he says if al does not come to me I

might die before they get here hmm

agreed sir is there anywhere nearby that

nothing nearby is there whether they may

have to start eating him and he points

to me took mmm

he's so-so

wait what what is meathook exactly he is

a here's an ogre zombie he

is a rotting undead auger strapped to

the front of this battered uh so he says

he's all rotten flesh now ice-cold mm ah

I can't say I'm stoked to go for frozen

ogre but I mean she have us on the

Isetta

ha how do you say

Narayana chimes in beggars cannot be

choosers right right well let's uh let's

wait a little bit of a longer spell you

know okay

let's wait until it starts to really get

rough all right the rest of the waffle

crew have been making their way along

through the Bleak landscape

no signs of snow just barren grayish

wasteland there the trees have become

very very sparse there's one that you

occasionally pass by a perception check

okay what are you going to do what are

you guys gonna do about waffles um I

have the idea of using some of my robes

to fashion a blindfold

so if Strix can fashion a blindfold and

then maybe just sort of like use like we

have rope and our adventuring pals stuff

to make like a sort of like a leash for

her yep so we'll happen we can all like

hold on to it because she's really

strong she's not in check for him

anymore

I can't polymorphic that many times and

it only lasts an hour and if it's been

16 days or more than that it's been hard

it's hard that yeah it's been almost

it's been over a month you just what

let's just wandering are you just

following this road the one thing that

Lord Niall can tell you having lived

here much longer than you is that there

that the shadow fell is sort of vast

and it's hard to ascertain just how far

one travels for how long here and

usually trips always feel painfully

longer than they should when there are

so few maps but if you were to find one

and tried to calculate the distance

between two places walk that distance it

could be like three five ten times

longer I'm still trying to make a map to

return us back to how we got here yeah

Lord Niall says you should probably give

that up okay waffles accepts the

blindfold and as you tuck her along with

the rope it doesn't take much to pull

her along she's not terribly resistant

and deprived of her visual senses she's

much less inclined to hurt anybody

yeah strix we'll just try and calm her

down just be like you know okay like

here have a snack it's it's fine yeah

death with your roll you see that

there's this old decrepit bent tree with

no leaves on it and there isn't the

shadows here aren't particularly since

there's no bright sunlight there's not

much in the way of shadows but this tree

seems to be casting one from an unknown

source and you can see in the shadow of

the tree there is someone hanging from

the tree by a noose mm-hmm kind of kind

of looks like you of course it does neat

that's normal

cool why does this always happen but

there's no there's clearly nobody

hanging from the actual tree it's just

in the shadow where this hang de man

appears can we see this or just heaven

only DF to be aware of it okay cool

mm-hmm so yeah we're just seeing the

shadow

and you're not sure if it's real or not

and like just like the sky could

recognize the silhouette of being myself

yeah oh yeah so even just that just

feels death with a familiar scent drew

bread and a feeling of I'll say it but

like uh an ending sense that at some

point he's going to let his friends down

and that's something you can't shake

from his head as memories like reef Lud

into his brain but at the same time he's

like shaking his head back and forth and

he's like no that's not there's nothing

there I can't be there this isn't none

of this is none of this is even

happening so okay great

and he's like hold like reaching around

his neck and making sure there's like

nothing there there's nothing a sudden

they wrapped around it or whatever yeah

Evelyn's looks at him doing that and she

turns destruction she's like what's

wrong with him

everyone's going barmy that's what's

wrong it's this place what

what does where why it's this place well

can't you do anything about it

can't I do anything about it I can't do

anything about anything except for put

bits of my trash robe on the owl bear

well you you did all the magic stuff you

can do magic hmm there's nothing I can

do about this yes like rip go back to

the other two as there are great yet

he's just like guys hey I'm okay right

am i okay I don't know are you okay I

don't know is he cursed I look at Holly

there's no remove can we remove a curse

I already did that it's it's theirs did

you see something what she'll just

she'll look at D if it's and ask him

yeah he'll still say I mean I did but

there's that yeah but I also don't know

that mean there wasn't anything there I

thought I saw something but it's not

it's not real I don't know

no it's not none of this is real neither

was injury neither were those evil

Buffalo with the glowing green eyes you

saw eight days ago they weren't real

either yeah this is dope yeah don't

worry about it it's I'm sure it's fine

don't worry about it but she even pokes

his cheek just to make sure he's real

yeah I just sort of push your metal

finger into his face and yeah he's real

okay all right okay so it seems yeah

Sark's is gonna take off a rip off a

piece of a robe and hold it up to D s

and be like put it on okay so it's

clearly a blindfold yo like kill takin

blindfold yeah then she takes the rope

and then just ties it onto his hand

she's just like everything's better now

so yeah he'll be tied there just keep a

hand too on strictest shoulder as he

bleeds him and he was just trying to

shut the rest of the world out of his

own perception but all he does is hear

everything around him even looks at this

this see he's like oh yeah this is

definitely a dream this all right

Lord nyle who doesn't say much he's

pretty dead quiet most of the time he

does say at some point in this journey

before I don't make it like you to

finish my family all right

wait how would you like us to do that

Lord now I'm sure Strix is the person

who's been having a conversation with

probably what everyone else is just like

I see dead people

yeah Lord nyle says that he is he's

going out to seek vengeance against the

shadow kai assassins who murdered his

family and tore off his face right he's

not oh you see that he's become sort of

more hunched and kind of smaller a

little bit as as this journey is worn on

like he's he's bought some time but he

is being eroded away

the longer this takes that's weird

yeah does he still have a covering over

his face he's got me he's got the burlap

bag back on his face so he's just

looking at you through burlap I holes me

oh I know actually I don't think Strix

cares enough to do an Archon attack just

like all right barmy it's fine his horse

his horse is also becoming a little bit

more emaciated but it's it seems to be

able to persevere just by eating a few

little Tufts of grass once or twice a

day off the side of the road that's good

if the horse is looking hungry at all at

any point during the day Miranda tries

to make like flowers but she ends up

just making graphs and shrub and ugly

little things but she can at least feed

it to the horse okay in that case yeah

the horse well we'll eat that and that

will actually nourish the horse more and

reduce its ailing nature so don't worry

learn Nile none of us are getting out of

this that were in the dead book for sure

we might be dead now I don't know

occasionally Miranda the horse will come

over to you and just sort of bump into

you like I'm hungry kind of bump she'll

be like at least I couldn't do this yeah

alright paltin you're back in the tavern

it's cold but you don't care cuz you

don't feel any of it

Muricy anna and levar doe have their fur

lined overcoats on and they're sort of

freezing cold but bearing with it this

is all part of your your yours and the

Rings grand plan and they're all in but

you see just empty flagons on the table

all the casks behind the bar were

emptied out so do I have an eye like a

rough idea of how long it took me to get

here yeah it took you you were in the

carriage at the time and you remember

long long periods where you were just

sitting there across from these two

you'd venture to guess maybe a month

maybe a little bit more and then you

spent actually all told it's been just a

little over a month you think

a raven lens on comes flying in through

the open doorway and lands on the bar

and you see that it has in its clutches

a dead mouse and it leaves it on the bar

and just sort of hops over to the end of

the bar and nerese iana and levar doe go

for the dead mouse they bring it back

over to the table and they slap it in

the middle and Jerry Sienna says well

this is lunch how should we divide it

you said that I hadn't eaten but I

didn't really care don't seem to the

rings evil seems to be sustaining you

yeah I'm just like you know what you

guys you guys go ahead I I'm not I'm not

super oh I got there we see on we'll

find a knife and begin cutting it right

on the table in two in half while that

goes on

levar dough takes out a little piece of

note paper starts writing something down

with a little quill pen and then rolls

it up into a tight little ball ties it

off with a little piece of string and

gives it to the Raven which it takes in

its claws and flies away whoa what was

that

he says little lamb thank you for the

regionally curva how do you say the

queen of the blackbirds

the who now the queen of the black bears

are the Ravens they are her messenger

Azusa this is a good sign my friend it

means that she is watching out for us

and he goes over and looks at the half

dead mouse I wish we had a stove just

like that feel Muricy anna says to

Lovato a heads or a tails ax AHA you're

too funny and he takes the tail Queen I

feel like that sounds familiar person I

don't know

yeah the ring will tell you that they

probably mean the Raven Queen

yeah Raven Queen yeah okay listen the

shadow fell you know oh yeah yeah her

her elves made me

oh she like some guess I'm probably like

a feather retype maybe hmm yeah I guess

I'm quiet rings I've never seen her but

yeah she goes oh she's called the Raven

Queen mmm

she's a bat or a big Raven mm-hmm true

big Ravens got it I'm gonna wait the my

hand is nearby

right yeah it's it's still crawling

about why do you want it to be I just I

just kind of glance over at him it's

like Raven Queen mm-hmm yeah interesting

yeah and the the ring will say you still

have the chalice right uh-huh yeah

when we kill them and when we stole

their blood you'll drink the blood out

of the chalice and boom-boom will be

will be done that'll be it

that's the ritual spill their blood

drink the blood we're done because of

course yeah of course

Lavar da will say and the Lovato's will

just look at the the chalice which

you're probably carrying on you and and

he can't hear your telepathic

conversation with the ring but some he

seems to maybe he caught you glimpse at

the chalice maybe just maybe it's just

coincidence but he says when we're done

here

alibi that off you if you like it's very

nice cup the the chalice see oh when

you're done when all this is done do you

have your domain and you're the king of

this land and all that sure we can we

can talk about that down the road why

not it's at that point where you hear

something outside and so dinner Luciana

and Lavar dough it sounds like another

wagon

trongo horse horse sounds someone want

to go see what that is

yeah they'll they'll sort of rush to the

door and look out and he's a wagon says

Lavar de turning back

and there you see anna says pulled by

two horses it's got a driver

it's a vardø

this is how what now a gypsy wagon okay

I like look out a window yeah when you

go over to a window you can see coming

up through the snow up one of the roads

not the road that you came from but one

of the other roads that meet at this

y-shaped crossroads

you see Avis tani wagon with little

lanterns hanging off the corners of it

brightly colored but it is sort of

carrying some snow and frost on it

there is a bundled up driver at the top

on the reins he's a big guy seems to

have a presence to him and there are two

gray and white mares pulling this wagon

through the snow and it is coming toward

the tavern you can see strapped on the

back of the wagon appear to be some

large casks tasks tasks interesting

I would like to about how how far is it

oh when you first hear it it's probably

about thirty yards away okay

so about a hundred feet and closing it's

it seems to be coming up the hill to the

tavern I'm gonna ask him like there we

are we expecting a shipment of some kind

Luciana says I would ask the innkeeper

but we ate him right of course maybe

it's a delivery perhaps and I would like

to use locate creature okay I want to

see if DF is within what is it a

thousand feet I want to see if I see if

Jenson you do not

detected EF in there as the driver of

the wagon gets closer you can see his

aside from he's a big guy one of his

other distinguishing features is he

seems to be he seems to have only one

arm he's holding the reins in one hand

his other arm seems to have been lopped

off or lost at some point there's

something vaguely familiar about him but

but as the wagon creeps up it sort of

stops out in front of the tavern and you

can see that there are a couple and not

miss Donny but they look like guards

come out from inside the wagon and one

of them says ale delivery

the other goes to the casks and starts

to unhook them from the wagon can I

avoid us like finale' mente oh we're

vixen all right this is uh this is a

delivery we want this we're not

suspicious at all

Lavar doesn't seem the least bit

suspicious he's going right over to the

casks and inspecting them and he says I

was it what are these Patel this word

and one of the guards says gone chill

grim dwarven ale you don't say where is

this gone till green the rider on top of

the wagon kind of looking at you

strangely he's kind of a big bald man

missing his one arm make a perception

check

he's also got you also see that sort of

stuck in the seat next to him is a big

battle axe that he could pry up and

wield at a moment's notice there is

something familiar about him but you

can't put your finger on it that is well

that that was a perception was a 12 yeah

and he sort of looks at you looks you up

and down and then says to the guards

hurry up we have to go this is a rotten

place ah rude livadas like yeah he's a

rotten but we don't care oh alright

we're going with it

ok sure yeah and he starts to help the

guards roll the casks over to the door

and the guards are happy to sort of Park

them out in the snow and then head back

into the wagon all right I'm gonna the

driver is looking around very carefully

like he's looking for someone else

and he says to Marianna beside you he

says are there any others here

guests patrons she says

no just us

the guards start to pile back into the

wagon

I'm gonna mmm

can I can I talk to that driver sure you

walk over through the snow next to the

horses wishes are huffing and puffing in

the cold there something I can uh can

help you with sir I'm getting I'm

getting some Oh what's the word what's

the word was sorta nonverbal

communication so uh and he says no

you don't think he means it but we have

other deliveries to make have have Matt

do I know you may be very helpful he

does look familiar I gathered that I

feel like I should just know like so

maybe we've met you look familiar

different time different place

hmm what's your name I'm same you know

what I got other stuff to do alright the

wagon leaves and it doesn't about-face

and goes down the hill and Narayana

comes up behind you and just sort of

hangs on you affectionately like she's

known you now a good enough time that

she's not violating any you know

personal space and she says what was

that all about

no no I guess I'll never know okay

she says sometimes I things do come back

to haunt us maybe we should kill them

that's foreboding and also hard to argue

with

Lavar doe says hey but if they bring us

a drink why do we kill them we want them

to come back don't we

I mean oh sure dwarven ale worth a try

and oceania just goes Oh

oh yeah no not worth the try mm-hmm yeah

I look at the ring I'm just like yeah

there's something this thing can't do it

it's make ale so we can we can we can

burn that bridge another day all right

the vardø leaves disappears into the

snow you've got four casks of dwarven

ale stamped with these the emblem of

Gaunt will Grimm make a intelligence

check Paulding Don tell Grimm that

sounds familiar

that is a very natural one okay well not

so familiar not so all right the ring

says to you telepathically oh oh you

know what we need hmm a dragon

come again you know our flying friends

problem we need a dragon what

personally the only dragon I have been

in contact with see it's not my biggest

fan yeah oh you're familiar oh yeah yeah

yeah I was there I was there right right

buddy

of course of course of course yeah I'm

but I'm thinking I'm thinking an ice

dragon that you can ride into battle

things he loves me I mean it'll take

some work not saying it'll be easy and I

might need to think absolutely yeah

maybe we should get on that

good job could take a few tries it's not

like making snowmen okay yeah yeah what

we need to do hmm

we need to burn some charges buddy

mm-hmm let's let's give her a shot then

all right the rest of the awful crew

your evylyn you've got blindfolded

palton and blindfolded waffles you've

got Simon leading the way and Strix

holding ropes

you've got Lord nylon Miranda is feeding

flowers to on a regular basis

that seems to be somewhat enamored with

her maybe even hoping that noir denial

dies so he can be forever and coming

down the road in the opposite direction

is a gypsy wagon with a big one-armed

rider taught to healthy horses I'm

rolling 50/50 for whether Ethan thinks

things are real I wrote an at 20 on that

way even has never been more sure that

something is real it has been a while

it's even since you've seen avestan e

wagon but that is as real of this Donny

wagon as you've ever seen and heard

everybody all of you can make perception

checks except Miranda who has no real

frame of reference here

I'm blindfolded and DF is blindfolded so

nothing for him okay I'm getting all

these walls out of your system 21 all

right that's fun the wagon trundle or

the the it comes right toward you you

see Lord Niall puts his hand on the hilt

of his sword in case this is a threat

bearing down but as that gets close

enough Strix you recognize easy and

eASIC recognizes you oh god I know God

but the last time you yes the last time

you saw Isaac he had both of his arms

his fiendish arm appears to have been

cut off or severed

[Laughter]

he is looking by the time so he didn't

roll great on his perception either and

you've changed a lot since the last time

you saw you right so years of go sucks

that's right yeah and but when you do

finally when your eyes finally lock

there is an irrefutable knowledge that

you have you have come together once

again and he sees you clear as day and

instinctively his hand just sort of goes

for the battle ax will you let me know

when evylyn recognizes him if she does I

will and he pulls up he pulls back on

the reins to stop the horses and the

Bardo comes to a dead stop in the middle

of the road I just go Strix goes off the

road No

okay so Strix is staying where she is

but okay so I imagine that even still

pointing like this body and Strix is

like grabbing her by the flying arm and

even flying like constructs just

dragging her off as she flies just

telling you to run but staying her

they're staying her ground yeah so

waffles goes bounding off in a random

direction Miranda what do you do when

strike screams run gonna climb onto the

back of the horse and sit there okay

with Lord Niall yeah okay so you just

pull up behind him essentially okay yeah

all right Laurel chase waffles okay

d/f you're standing blindfolded now in

the middle of the road with strict

screaming run yeah he's mostly just

going miss tricks will say it's easy

like when you hear that what do you do

so hearing that he'll like take the

blindfold and like know the horses and

then you can see Esek perched on top of

the Bustani vardø the last time you saw

him he wasn't missing his fiendish arm

and here he like like you he's he

recognized you because the last time you

two stared each other down was in the

courtyard

yo Garden of Castle Ravenloft when he

threatened to kill you yes so after

seeing this real or not it doesn't

matter to death he immediate is like

clutches onto the blindfold it rips it

off and why just drops it to the ground

I merely just pulls out gutter all right

Isaac will stand on top of the bar out

with his battle axe in his one-man alarm

it's at that time that the two guards

inside the wagon come out one on each

side you can see that they appear to be

Baratheon guards similar to the militia

in Valachi kind of dressed shabbily

their armor old and ill maintained and

they've got fur cloaks on to keep them

warm and fur hats pulled on over their

head with little flaps over their ears

but they come out and they've got hand

axes and crossbows Strix is gonna step

in front of Dias that's not happening

nope and she's gonna look straight at

eASIC and just kind of be like like just

look at him say I told you once that

they were my family and I'm not gonna

let you do this again I will kill you

I'm gonna try and intimidate him okay go

ahead all right

twenty-one all right

yes AUV you give him you give him a

blistering verbal assault he hops down

off of the top of the wagon and takes

the axe and just kind of plants it in

the ground and he says

I am sorry yeah this is all

none of this is real real eye for water

knows it's real it's real

and then he'll approach not aggressively

he'll he'll sort of walk toward you

slowly he does not seem to have any

weapons okay like you as he approaches

DF is like trying to get in front of

Strix and like gutter ready yeah it's

like it's fine it's fine

howdy-hi points you and when he have a

quiet conversation he says I am a

changed man

the heart he ones just like flying after

Hurley and then she I think even jumps

on waffles and they come over together

back to the wagon the death is

practically like shaking in his hand was

just trying to restrain himself Yeah

to you so that's something I'm shaking

shall like hold his hand just like no

I'm she'll follow Isaac wherever he's

going I never wanting to hurt you and

your friends but I couldn't help myself

 sheesh even even arrives it

goes this swaggins totally real he says

we're cursed with fiendish blood what do

they expect us to becoming I'm not like

you I don't kill innocent people

no no you've never killed anyone

innocent I mean it was an accident if I

did okay he will kind of push one of the

guards aside when you peer into the dark

gloom of the the back of the Bustani

wagon you see a large number of parents

just a lot of paraphernalia there's a

small stove in there there's some

hanging stuff

some some small little banners and

tapestries and things there's a chest

all kinds of stuff little hammocks on

both sides that the guards use things

like that but you also see a stuffed

here there and everywhere are dolls

oh my collection I make you I make them

too something we have in common

she's like just laughing to herself and

he goes into the depths of this wagon

used to see his huge hulking lumbering

form move inside and the whole wagon

sort of shakes as he moves back and

forth and when he comes out he tosses

something out onto the ground and it's

the straud puppet and in the back of the

wagon Isaac will say we got this in God

Hoberman know but it back what are you

doing with that there it sucks no

dresses nice job I'll dress said well

he'll take it they're gone full grim

Strix will pick it up and put it in her

robes me like you know that's really him

right yes then why did you bring it back

to us because he might be the only one

who can save you what oh no no tricks

we're done I'm done with this I'm done

with him nope Ennis it's our only choice

sure sure he'll hop back out of the

wagon he says I've done what I set out

to do

who told you to do this he's ik

lady walked up why because she cares

about Jill no she doesn't

she cares about thus kissing she doesn't

care about me what's the difference

what's the dish I don't do the

difference is they can all they can all

go be in the dead book for all I care

he'll close up the wagon what are we

supposed to do with this poppet just

release him art like yeah could you

elaborate on how exactly straw the evil

monster whom we have had to defeat

multiple times and who has done terrible

unspeakable things to not only us but

lots of other people are supposed to

save us I don't have all the information

I just do what I'm told and I want to

help you I really do because I do care

about you more than I care about my own

life well eASIC you need to work on that

because that's not healthy now if you

even also does not believe that if you

want me to follow you where you're going

and help you more I will yes we need

help what no please have my own we need

help

not for them what are we going to do

we're stuck here I don't know I will die

for you and they will die for me we need

help

evylyn gets really really close to eASIC

and looks in his eyes can I roll the

insight check you sure can

17 wants to know if he's being genuine

um you think that based on your role

that Isaac believes that this is the

best way to help Strix but you also get

the sense that this is what he has been

told to do that he is essentially a

mercenary in this thing somebody has

told him you want to help your sister do

this thing and so he has done it so you

don't like this close to his face and

she yells to Strix without moving from

his face uh I don't think he's lying but

also he may just be how do you put it

barmy

he's definitely barmy I don't think we

should ever release strut ever ever ever

she yells that into e6 face what are you

huh Strix we can't not for him not like

this he'll he'll go too far to do

something wrong but we can't not from

him he can help us we just know we ain't

released in stride no way no how

dream or not I am never releasing a

stride in any realm in any dimension no

way no sir

Boop Isaac no but either can help us if

he wants I don't think he's evil paltin

how many charges would have the ring

would you like to try to spend to create

this dragon one-half let's go with

you know what let's let's let fate

decide any charges looks like I will be

trying for nine okay your your first

great experiment into dragon creation

fails horribly you basically get a

dragon like a sculpture that has no real

semblance of the life spark to animate

it is just not there mm-hmm

now I know that without even a check

well

good great tomorrow then yeah sounds

good all right Lombardo by the way it

gets totally sloshed on dwarven ale

mm-hmm get Oliver yeah I just imagine

like just just Paulding is just like

slugging around trying to make this ice

dragon like throwing stuff against walls

just like where are they taking forever

[Laughter]

yes the the word that the the shadow

kyu's is big on t hurry up get on with

it

mm-hm

and then you hear shouting downstairs in

the back in the tavern they're getting

into an argument which happens they both

seem to be very very where their

emotions seem to swing wildly from one

end of the spectrum to the other but

you're not exactly sure what it's over

that seems like a problem yes

and then as night approaches they creep

up into your quarters like ghosts and

sleep in your bed oh man good company

you got am I am i aware of this Oh snake

in that way I'm just like just try and

get comfy and let's have a couple inches

between yeah okay all right what are you

guys gonna do with Isaac we need help

I hate this I hate this do you wanna die

or do you want to deal with his barmy

ass Isaac who told you to come help us

who told you Bobby the doll where you

walking he got the doll himself he he

and his he actually had a larger force

that crept into GaN pilgrim and took the

doll at great cost who told you that you

needed that doll and why do you think

that we new lady walked ER told him to

get the doll lady doctors my aunt I

think Starks we'll ask him like she's

like my mom's sister who was my mom do

you know he was basically orphaned like

you so oh great so we're just we're just

the losers all right yeah you're both

you're both you're both castoffs great

basically ax sent into isolation of

course cuz I'm a dumpster person I

understand it's fine

I'm used to being a table stir-fry but

we need help so des please just we need

help and we need to go we're like 15

days late we need to go find paltin

right now okay

I can't believe this I can't how are we

just trusting him it doesn't we don't

trust him do you want me to blindfold

him - it's real don't you see the wagon

yep it's real everything's fine

he hung me I I'm aware of him I am aware

of that but this might be our only way

to get out of here and I'm less evil

there if he can have his fiendish arm

cut off and be nice then probably palton

can have his stupid ring night-night cut

off taking off and be nice again - so

everything is fine let's go I'm not nice

what the hell makes you think that straw

could do anything for us what could he

possibly do we're not releasing straud

miranda looks to learn beyond she's like

[Music]

more denial actually we'll say I have to

make a check for him okay he'll say that

he has heard of Straub's on zero vetch

apparently he's a very powerful vampire

lord who carved out a domain for himself

out of the shadow fell is he nice and it

sounds like that's exactly what paltin

is doing but in a different way he says

as far as yours as far as he knows about

straw distraught is like the the

archetypal vampire he is fish evil to

the core and irredeemable and here he is

holds up the puppet weight but that's a

wait he's in the doll yeah we killed a

kid to put him in here let's go I see it

was he always a dollar we just Rick's

just walks away as Miranda's talking

okay

so what's the plan look deaath if you're

too upset to go with eASIC we cannot

kill him because he has surrendered I've

done what I set out to do I can make it

easy on you and attack you uh no no

thank you

yeah I'm not Strix what I'm putting a

lot of faith in you because I trust you

you'll turn back to ease I can point

gutter at him and he'll say just know if

you make even the slightest wrong move

what you're gonna kill me with your

toothpick and I sword will drink until

it has its fill don't worry about that I

will burn you back to the house before

he can even get you with the sword so

don't even stress I'll smash something

too we are all very capable people we

will destroy you if you hurt any of us

because we are a family and she looks at

everyone no but we have to save Paulson

and we need all the help that we could

get fine we go

hide him fine that's fine that's stabby

stabby whatever whatever you need I saw

up Alton what where wait what was he

okay did he solve the ring on him he

looks different how did I hmm I almost

didn't recognize him but still like

super handsome right he says he's at a

old tavern or a crossroads covered with

snow well andis cold

oh and there's like a hundred snowman

everywhere that's weird how far is it

few days let's go you can take us there

come on come on she starts like pushing

waffles but together he'll get he'll

climb up onto the Bardot and have it

turned around um can I call it a is it

can say is it just him no he is with to

dusk elves oh I think those are for you

Lord Nile you gonna put some cutters in

the dead book right yes Lord Nile was

like I will kill them both that's the

spirit

you know that guy with the bag on his

head is not real right you keep talking

- you know she's sort of like taps him

on the arm and like grabs his hand and

sort of waves it around like yeah he's

real that other ghost is talking to me

again Simon Simon will actually sort of

grab onto the back of the wagon and just

sort of sit on a little bench on the

back so he's just sort of riding on the

back

I'm sure Simon and Strix did that quite

a bit back in Beryl yeah yeah yeah he

misses that oh okay let's go let's go

potty time I'll do you head up the road

following Isaac's vardø as he guides it

north ever north and as he continues to

march on DF your maximum hit points are

now 23 and strix your maximum points are

now 34 stop that please I love you so

for the record the entire time while

we're traveling with music DF does not

put got her away

I understand smart move and then you

start to see not only there's a

temperature drop but you see snow

everywhere and soon you are plotting

through snow following ruts that were

left on its southward journey and and

marching through this stuff unless

you're evil and you've got little winged

boots and you can just fly above the

snow dress and when waffle sees the snow

she starts to galumph

through it and leave troughs and paths

everywhere she can barely she she seems

pretty happy plowing her face through

the snow for a while but it's all just

sort of white and barren and dead you

see the occasional tree

waited under the snow you also see small

houses or something off on distant Hills

that have sort of collapsed under the

weight of the snow and it just gets

getting colder and colder and colder and

colder and windier and just altogether

more unpleasant blustery gales blowing

snow in the eyes DF and Strix and

Miranda this will affect you most

prominently evylyn you're not fazed by

the temperature changes at all I would

say it never bothered me anyway but

we've already oh well Strix can always

have fire around so she'll just try and

warm everyone up a fire yeah Brianna's

gonna do it produce flame a couple of

times and yeah she'll also while DF is

like just holding a sword out of eASIC

like it's like keep kind of like asking

easy questions like are the Laura Casas

angel people yeses kept warned by his

rage yeah now things like fireballs and

produce flames they're momentary like

you're not gonna get through an entire

24-hour period and basking in the flames

created by these spells on the other

hand evylyn you're sort of Spinelli you

can ignite that and leave it ignited as

long as in your grasp or let somebody

else attune to the weapon and use that

flame to keep them warm if one can just

some take place in the middle of the

party the heart of Spinelli because her

aura is protective anyway so she's like

now everyone stay close all the monsters

and the Ghoulies and all that won't get

us if we're all together and she's

holding up the sword like come on

everyone like a tour guide excellent and

still on the sword and Strix where are

you putting the straw puppet it's in my

robes okay yeah I'm not letting anyone

get it do you want me to hold up no I

want it to stay in my robes but you're

kind of um you don't know what you don't

know it's real I have

all right how many charges would you

like to use the next day mmm let's go

with well okay make a charisma check for

me oh okay that's a good so seventeen

okay alas that does not give you a very

big dragon at all and shame yeah another

day passes how many charges would you

like to spend the next day I don't want

to use all of them in case they show up

today yeah that would be inconvenient I

need you also stole the ring array

it

oh honey that's a great let's try 13

okay make another charisma check eleven

yeah no dragon mmm

cool the next day I talked to the ring

I'm just like all right dude if it

doesn't happen today I'm gonna assume

that we need to find other means it's

that cool cool I'm gonna try thirteen

again okay mmm God like all right it's

time to start thinking of other ideas

all right waffle crew with the with

Isaac levar dough and Lord Niall

you guys are trudging through the snow

and I'm a traveling question yes um is

evylyn a tune I assume she's attuned to

her magic boots and that's one of her

slots for attuned items

so she can only be attuned to a two to

two magic things three things are you

total three more yeah two more

yes okay she's longingly looking at the

Sun sword that's off okay and you see

through the snow three hills of

surrounding a y-shaped crossroads that

have snow covered crow cages on them and

atop one of these low hills is a

run-down snow burdened old tavern that

old beat-up coach pulled by some

horrible monstrosity parked next to it

when Strix sees that she'll goat a sick

is that where Paulson is that's where I

saw him

all right we need to stop we need a plan

Miranda immediately well what is it

called mess with the wild into the snow

to try and hide that's our plan all

right

gets cold under there that's just like

her soul it's fine okay

Lord Nile will stop his emaciated horse

and wait for a plan to unfold music will

stop the wagon he'll go oh go ahead go

on was the saying can I take easy like

he isn't gonna leave music I want to ask

eASIC what to do with the puppet without

anyone hearing yeah is it goes into the

the vardø as he does as he's done many

times up at this point

and lights the stove and basically just

sits next to the stove in the vardø

heats the place up good and hot because

he likes heat and you're sitting next to

him and one of these on one of these hot

moments not really affected by the heat

yourself being a tiefling and he says

you either tear the puppet apart or set

it on fire if you destroy it it will

release the vampire

okay and why will this help us castrato

/ powerful he won't help us he'll kill

us

maybe that's what I'm trying to avoid

but maybe you want this does not seem

like a very foolproof plan no it does

not but I'm in the wagon alone listening

to it so but he says but you look very

weak and so does that scrawny boy you

call a friend tricks just lengthen like

little fires at her hand she's like like

yes you're right I suppose

evylyn could you know deal with this on

her own she doesn't know what's real she

can't deal with anything on her own also

her fighting palton is not something I

want to happen then why are we here to

get him back

but he can't be killed right now he's

under a he has a like a power that this

snar sin gave him he can't be killed

I'm not big in the brains Department

that's right big everywhere else we just

do what I'm told

oh oh tell me why I should do this I

know that you care about me as your

sister but why should I let's trot out

why would Lady Wachter want to save me

she said she likes you she doesn't want

any harm to come to you she wonder why

she wants me to go back to the Skiz --ax

worse things have happened no they

haven't

you're unaware of this I want to will

this save my friends did she say

anything he says so you're telling me

you're worried that evylyn can't stop

Paul Tom and I'm sorry paulten I like

him calling him Paul - yeah it's a

Stefani so look for these simmer don't

release him but he is a vampire lord

maybe he can make palton take off the

ring he wants it for himself

I heard vampires are very persuasive oh

all right all right fine Barbie is okay

go back to it's just you wanna go back

in and stab him D if I don't know I'm I

don't care I just don't care

we should - she's like I just don't want

him everyone to die as she walks out

saying this do you just like wait what

direly waiting come on there's Mountain

over there okay called you scrawny yep

another Raven comes to the the tavern

bringing more food for Narayana and

Lavar dough but also kind of squawking

in a strange way and it seems agitated

what's wrong what's wrong with this one

am I not sure and when Narayana goes

over to try to pick it up it it flies

off out outside and continued squawking

ah uh I like try and take a peek to see

like where it's going when it's up to ya

when you stick your head out make a

perception check and I'll give you

advantage okay well first role wasn't at

twenty excellent so something happens

when you step out when you step out into

the snow it's like you can feel where

your friends are because they are in

contact with it oh oh oh my god oh my

god no it'll get very excited and they

come running out to you and they look

around they don't see anything where are

they I don't know I I can feel it though

yeah you can tell that they're there

some distance away but probably close

enough that they can see this big giant

building you're standing next to and you

know they're coming from that direction

the direction you came from mm-hmm so I

can but I can't see them you can't

currently okay well you well it's almost

like it's almost like you know exactly

where they are like you can you could

you could say they're like about 500 600

yards in that direction so they're close

okay five 600 yard your ring currently

is fully charged

so there is a big information there

other sermon like landmass formations

that prevent you from seeing them plus

the weather the the falling snow is that

like maybe yelling distance uh over the

wind it would be very very hard but if

you were to move out in that direction

you could okay how many charges was it

to make a nice clone okay that is I

believe six hmm hmm oh man I should have

planned more oh I know

just add first level mm-hmm I'm just

going to cast a thunder wave because

that's pretty loud it can be heard out

to a range of 300 feet

JK that's not loud enough no okay

I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna make a clone

right then there's no paulten a

materializes or comes up out of the snow

in front of you okay all right

looks just like you uh okay okay uh go

get them does he look a gold part Holton

or cop oh yeah okay so the rest of you

are over buying your wagons and horses

and whatnot you see paltin coming

marching through the snow up the road

toward you but he his skin has taken on

a bluish tinge you can almost see kind

of like blue veins on his pale arms and

neck and his hair is raven black and

longer than it used to be can I not get

like overly close but like just

supposedly close no not too close cuz

I'm so he's gonna like walk up like

still keeping some distance after

everyone sees him he's just like hey

even even in not knowing what's real and

what's not and me rolling for 50/50 also

rolled in at 20 on this poll okay so she

is certain that this is the real Politan

and she's like we missed her so much

what did you do to your hair I mean it

looks pretty good anyway but and uh the

he's just gonna say he's up there

waiting for you and they just turns the

sloshed not real I knew it this wasn't

real I knew it everyone needs to stay

here everyone everyone needs to stay

here and just not move that's that's

just we we can't this is so bad this is

so so bad

and what's wait for him no we can't

yes Miranda um how much does Miranda

know about the Raven Queen a good

question make a intelligence religion

check I can do the answer I can do that

27 Wow okay so here's the skinny you're

buried in the cenote about the Raven

Queen and what memory tells you your

long elven memory tells you is there was

a conflict years ages ago which caused a

division in the elves the conflict

between the good elves and the drow

there was an elf queen who tried to deal

with that conflict and tried to bring

the elves back together and her name is

lost time but she intended to work a

great magic spell with the aid of

several other elves and the spell did

not go off as intended and she sort of

sank into despair and retreated at her

failure into the depths of the shadow

fell as the good owls and the Eagles

became even more divided so her her

ambition failed ultimately but it was a

noble effort and she put a lot of

herself into the spell and she became

sort of weakened and infirmed and

retreated from the world a number of the

elves who fought under her served under

her she was their queen went with her

into the shadow fell and became known as

the dusky elves or the shadow kai and

over time exposure to the shadow fell

may have had some dolorous effect on her

but something happened and she

transformed into a more godlike being

kind of bound to the shadow fell with

these elves in service to her and all

you know is that she is now kind of an

emblem of death sort of a goddess of

death who uses Ravens to make sure that

souls get to where they need to go but

occasionally a soul will so catch her

interest like a raven she wants to hoard

it and keep it and protect it and so she

kind of locks it away in the shadow fell

and her elves go out into the shadow

felon into the world to try to find

these people of destiny and these people

of great souls not necessarily good

souls possibly even Dark Souls who

should be shepherded and cultivated and

helped to achieve their complete and

full destiny and that's what she sort of

does and these elves go around and they

collect mementos of greatness and bring

them to her so that she can decide what

souls to keep versus what wants to let

her Ravens carry off into the afterlife

while granda is still in her little

hidey hole in the snow she's gonna say a

quick prayer to the Raven Queen and

almost a prayer to what she was and what

she stood for before she came to the

shadow fell but also the the being that

she is now okay

just with all of her every small amount

of ho

that she still has left just put into

this prayer okay that shrieking Raven

that was costing the tavern not too long

ago lens on top of the vardø and squawks

at you Miranda

okay I'm gonna pop my head out of the

snow and look right at it okay

it has fixed its beady eyes on you can I

tell if it wants anything from me you're

not sure but if this is some sort of an

emissary or agent of the Raven Queen

it's possible it might want some kind of

trinket or memento okay um I'm going to

something something that has a memory

attached to it you're gonna stand up and

walk over to where it is and put my arm

up in case it wants to land and then go

through my pack and pull out my you wand

okay it will it will land on your arm

and it will take the you wand up in its

talons and then fly off north Strix is

like you got friends I don't know I

think it liked me I don't know maybe it

hated me and it's just using this to

track me down later I don't know I tried

you guys I tried to get help and I don't

think I did it great strikes is gonna

use alter self to turn herself into

strawed oh I don't like this alright so

you're this ghastly pale haunting figure

of straud please please stay here and

then she'd dimension doors to the tavern

you'll have to dimensioned or multiple

times she'll do it okay Oh oh this seems

bad no evil in all of us run for the

tavern as far as I'm concerned yeah okay

yeah we're not good at staying put no

started music didn't get any order so

he's just hanging out here

like come on you think she's like she's

right he'll know he'll hop on he'll hop

off the vardø take his battle-axe and go

marching up the road through the snow

okay with his two guards behind him and

Lord Niall will take his horse forward

so as we're up running there can I take

one of the sticky poisons that I had

received way back when before rosin you

see and then apply it to one of my

daggers sure right here you notice that

you're applying it here dagger your hand

is shaking in the cold you do it but

it's oh yeah

damn have to have a copper rage it's

just all kind of shakiness

palton they're closing on you one faster

than the others it's tricks okay

everyone uh-uh

places places places and I like go

inside I like to find a chair I'm like

okay chair I'm like constantly like

adjusting pose I'm like okay make a

perception check as you're moving chairs

were just moving tomorrow 19 okay you

see in a dark corner of the tavern what

appears to be a figure that wasn't there

before you just catch it out of the

corner your eye

it seems to be it looks like almost like

a hunched Crone but made entirely of

twigs do I recognize it you've seen

you've seen her before in that shadow

fell fortress you were a spirited off

too after saving evil in soul she's the

one who gave you the hand I'm saying and

when you see it you hear this sound it

was like oh oh and I uh I have the the

chalice like yeah

I I got a thing

you see her just sort of or it pull kind

of back into the shadows and then it's

gone okay

just not it and then Lavar toe taps you

on the shoulder like that ah Jesus

what yeah hi yeah hi who are you talking

to no uh where do you want us take okay

um just uh you don't have a plan do you

I'm like look I have I have the I have

the general just just like stay hidden

lay low you'll know they look at each

other and nod and then they silently

skulk off paulie's gonna do like a quick

look okay okay all right cool

all right Strix as stride you go banff

500 feet banff another 500 feet banff

another 500 feet how many dimension

doors do you want to use 500 yards so

that's 1,500 feet so far so that's three

I just like going my broom for some of

that sure okay straw it on a broom so

you're gonna use let's say you used one

spell slots and a broom did all right

all right so you see you see that the

tavern has all these hanging twig glyphs

off of it it's got a pile of snow on

it's weighted down roof that's collapsed

and has holes in it in a few places you

see a battered old coach with a ogre

zombie strapped to the front of it in

front what do you do there's also a dark

opening where the door would be but

there's no door can I yell with my and

there's an army of snowmen every

um ah can I just like yell with my like

vomit or just be like Paul Ted you don't

want to turn into Straub that's really

bad

we have a visual representation for you

out here

doesn't wait so when when she's

transform does it still sound like

strike sir

[Laughter]

that's a good question

I mean you you kind of know it's strict

you're currently omnipresent and you've

seen her do this before this isn't a new

trick

[Music]

but alter self I'm just checking to see

if it's only visual you change your what

you look like but not what you sound

like

no coming out of strut I hear this I

hear so I hear that yeah yeah okay I'm

just like and she's obviously on a broom

because you can hear it backfire doors

open I mean it's that me it's not even

there and come in fine as soon as he

says that I'll turn back in distress are

you going to I'll just yeah I'll just

land I'm just gonna go on the door just

feel like all right why are you doing

this make a precision check strings I

got a one okay oh my gosh

psyche smokes where where's everyone

else they're dead you killed them hang

on all right as you walk in the door and

you sort of your eyes adjust from the

white to sort of the dark gray interior

Strix you are backstabbed

how much Weiss hold on that's a reaction

so the first attack hits you and I have

to roll demo as one of the shadow kai

assassins gets yeah the stab has already

happened though right the stab has

happened

I see the stab I'm just like that wasn't

it

okay was it straight the first stab does

34 points of damage okay then you fall

unconscious before you can take a

reaction and then the other one stabs

you again okay which means you fail or

asset they hit you

which means you fail to death saves

right I shall do the first one that what

is it why we so Politan she comes in

your shadow kai assassins come out

stabbed her twice in the back she goes

down with a thump and they like hold

their daggers output dripping with blood

and they're like what I had a speech I

had a plan and there was this weird

there was this really cool cutscene in

my head but then she showed up and it

different for Milan and I had to like

try and do quickly but all right now

it's fine it it's fine it's it's no

reason Ursula will look absolutely

flabbergasted but lavarro will come up

and say oh excuse excuse and he'll he'll

hug you I'm just like it's fine it's

fine it's fine it's fine it's fine we

can work with it um let's roll

initiative for everybody else and Strix

all right 8h for evylyn 1313 for DF Wow

12 for Strix Miranda that did not go how

I planned by the way 16 even with my

disadvantage and palton 19 alright yeah

so Paulton you are definitely the first

to go like oh god okay and the rest of

them are aren't here yet correct

can I like feel how far they are with

the snow thing you're not currently in

contact with the snow so no you're

you're inside

however Narayana says says to you or

sorry levar doe says perhaps now would

be a good time to drink a blood it's

like just like back Oh God

okay um do I know if there's like is

there is there anything Salas oh oh

thank you you're so helpful

thank you I'm just like all right I'm

just gonna like grab just a couple like

drops please is this does this count as

my action this if you're planning to

drink her blood yes I just kind of

wanted to catch a couple with the

chalice and just set it aside for now

okay let me see on this like maybe we

should wait until she's dead how does

this work like I I'm just like okay okay

I have this there's some of it in there

I don't know there's no legs sit down

sit down like okay um so do I do I have

yeah you're cat yeah you have an action

you're trying to count some of the blood

and the thing and then put it off on a

table somewhere okay

could I just dimension door her body

elsewhere I said okay I just I don't

like dealing with this right now doesn't

it have to be a willing creature hang on

yeah I was just looking that up yes it

has to be a willing creature that she's

not currently hmm okay um they're like a

like a like a rug or something and just

I'm just gonna like just grab something

nearby and just like put it over like a

you so pull this old matted rug toward

her but you have to sort of like it's

underneath some furniture so you're like

trying to tug it out from under some

tape

and chairs and it's just scaring to

pieces in your hands so now only two

pieces of a rug time levar dough will

kind of fade back into the shadows see

who else blunders through the door

notice IANA she's searching Strix and

she pulls out the strog doll which is

what's these oh no no that's only freaks

you out like no that thing uh uh that

thing needs to be as gone as f right now

okay don't don't mess with it don't

break it

I mm-hmm don't like it well hmm story

store it and we'll well we'll put a pin

in that what not literally I mean well

we'll cross that later just all right

keep it out of sight Miranda what do you

do uh running just as fast as I can

towards the I think I'm gonna I'm gonna

hit and passed once okay yes as you make

your way through you see you are now

kind of in a field of snowmen with

little coal eyes coal nose and coal

mouths little sticks sticking out of

their midsections little buttons down

the front and as you begin to run

between them they turn and and look at

you and they shudder and begin to move

toward you okay sorry sorry I'm gonna

use my ring to one of my three charges

to cast my RAM and sort of try and send

them flying away from me okay you can

definitely hit one of them with your RAM

okay so a force like blast comes out of

your ring and takes on the likeness of a

ram

head as it slams into one of these

snowmen and I need to make a roll and I

don't I'm reading it right now bring the

RAM there it is oh it's a tack roll so

you make a plus seven bonus to your d20

roll and if you hit it you damage it 18

okay you definitely hit it roll to d-10

force damage and you knock it back five

feet I don't like snow ten all right

boom when you slam into it all the snow

just blows back and underneath it is an

ice man that looks like paltin but he's

got this ice sword in its hand and when

you slam to this force it gets knocked

back not only did you knock the snow man

off of it but you also created cracks

all down the front of this soldier as

well but it is still intact

cool okay and as the other ones advanced

toward you you see their snow beginning

to fall away as well revealing ice

sculptures of paltin underneath

excellent and there are there must be at

least a hundred of them oh okay and then

we come to D F he can't fly

yeah can fly and you see DF Miranda sort

of run ahead and she's being surrounded

by a dozen or so of these snowmen the

others are also waking up and it's a lot

of them between you and that tavern he's

just gonna keep sprinting towards that

tavern as fast as you possibly can for

some reason the snowmen start to engage

or start getting close to closing in on

them I'll use cutting action to

disengage okay be able to swiftly pass

them yeah so right now like they haven't

gone yet they haven't attacked yet so

you can basically disengage your way

through them without provoking any

hobbies okay yeah so that's me doing

he's like trolling his way around like

dodging left

yeah swerving his way all around them

and just running towards a tavern with a

sudden sense of sickening dread and

didn't feel like the coldness or the

snow around them at this point he is

just focused on that and he just keeps

saying into himself over and over no

this isn't real this isn't real no this

isn't real all right Strix on your turn

you disappear right Halton you see Strix

is bleeding form just kind of oily she

vanishes and there's just a cloud of

oily smoke where she used to be um what

what is God okay this is huh this is not

how I pictured head can I can I can I

perceive what might have happened yeah

when she disappeared up in the frost

giant village quite suddenly spirited

away as it were she came back some time

later after you'd gotten on your airship

and flied off to child telling stories

that she was spirited away by another

party of adventurers all right okay you

think that may have just happened

together say oh so it's so right Rhys

now she's bleeding okay so you know as

soon as things start happy you do so

whoops sorry god no the party to go dude

okay cool yeah and so the and so that's

tricks astern evylyn you see Miranda is

using some sort of ring power to blast

snowmen as they close in around her

death is deacon through a bunch of these

snowmen soldiers what do you do I am

also booking it toward the tavern okay

and I'm flying and I just

ignite the sort of Spinelli for the -

Manila all right flames crackle all the

way up to the tip of the blade as you

hold the weapon out and it lets out this

roof sound and I I'm I'm heading over

that all these snowmen the army yeah but

you know how like if you're a kid and

you're just dragging a stick along the

ground as you walk that's kind of how

I'm I'm using the sword I would love to

just kind of come across a lot of these

ice Paulson's heads okay I don't know

how that works mechanically you can only

technically attack one but if all you're

doing is kind of batting them like I'm

not intending to damage them per se you

can definitely do that and kind of knock

all the snow off of them so all there's

snowmen

maybe it's like kind of intimidating you

know they've got like little like Nick

melt they got little necks all through

their heads yeah I'm doing that like

along the path because I'm just trying

to go as far as I can as fast that yeah

but like parallel to D s so kind of

along the same path it's a melty heads

yeah so as described like bounding

between them avoiding their their

opportunity attacks you're just like

knocking them in the heads taking little

chips out of them as you go and always

how different our styles are yes indeed

okay and Lord nyle is going to charge in

after Mirenda

and whack at one of these ice soldiers

and hit it hard

okay and waffles is I mmm you want her

charging into the army of snowmen as

well I have one but they'll ever keep

her alive hmm I'm gone but same I tell

her - yeah I tell her - go go wait for

us over there

thank you go sit by that tree and you

don't move all right she just sort of

plops down by the trees sort of Pat's

her feet nervously I'll karate okay and

Simon will I take off her blindfold - in

case that was still on her okay Simon is

going to follow and attack

you rolled an 18 on the die this sounds

foreboding

Miranda aha Miranda make a constitution

saving throw excellence ha ha

19 excellent you saved misses so you

take one point of damage from a dart

that sort of sticks you in the back and

you take half damage from his poison so

you take 16 points of poison damage for

a total of 17 points of damage that's

rude

alright paltin hmm I'm gonna let you

take the last action of this game what

would you like to do has strictest oily

smoke evaporates in the air how far am i

from making contact with the snow is

just right outside it's like 10 feet

okay I wanna I'm gonna walk outside to

see what I see in feel as soon as you do

that you can see DF running up the snow

toward you about okay 60 feet away

evylyn about the same distance away but

up in the air whacking your ice soldiers

in the head with a flaming sword as she

goes past and you see Miranda and a guy

with a sack on his head on a horse

biting off a bunch of your ice soldiers

how far are Miranda and the guy and the

horse they're about the same distance

about 60 feet away just off to the side

from death and evil and so you see fie

okay I'm gonna quickly talk to the ring

like so when you see blood are the

friends it's like that one right there I

point to Miranda I'm just like that one

there's not we're not super tight her no

okay cuz she seems like she's gonna be a

problem so it's got a crush on me

that's true it's like everyone

she seems most problematic and also

least useful agreed right her okay cool

I'm gonna cast banishment on her okay

and get her the gtfo out of here

so banishment requires a saving throw

Miranda okay that would be a charisma

saving through okay seventeen you thwart

him okay girls girl just I call them

like you are such a pain in my

all right and we will pick up this

battle next week when the waffle crew

returns for another exciting episode all

right it's just like know so it knows

that I love it yes we'll stay an

initiative order and the first person to

go next week will be you Miranda now

Holly you've got you you're going to be

putting in an appearance tomorrow yes on

acquisitions Inc the C team yes I won't

you'll have to tell Jerry bleeding that

you've got two failed death saves the

most powerful members of X is a dramatic

entrance to the sea team and I'm very

excited but alright very concerned at

least they have someone that can heal

you know maybe strict should just stay

there

actually she would never all right

anybody got anything they'd like to

share at the crew before

break off for the week I'm gonna be on

waffle top right after this you can cry

with them yay

they talk about Dom stresses and I love

strikes so we would never ever do I do

have the second episode of my podcast

for a DM for the first time it's called

Chico's down episode 2 alla wine is good

wine how was how was the second episode

compared to the first in terms of DM

experience I learned quite a bit from

the first episode namely don't prepare

so much because you set up a plot hook

and your your players will go mmm

no we're gonna go see this dude that has

an ox even though that's not at all part

of the game so yeah I made up pretty

much all of this episode on the fly

excellent yeah speaking of which fight

show in the bird cage it's on Thursdays

where I haven't prepared at all so I'll

probably be doing the same thing it'll

be great we got Ana's in the game but

it's been really fun it's a Planescape

game there's there's we're ravens and

I'm having a blast playing a character

that's completely selfish and a

kleptomaniac has been a nice break she's

already tried to steal from NPCs and

it's hilarious oh I did steal for sure

you did and you did hmm

speaking of shows my show that idea miss

cooks D&D lost mine in which we play

these starters that adventure for fifth

edition Dungeons & Dragons

they lost mine a fan delver will be in

30 minutes on twitch.tv slash miss

clicks so starting at 6:30 Pacific time

and I'm doing it because I've been

saying I wanted to DM forever and I know

there are a lot of people like me that

would like to but feel like there's a

huge barrier to entry and they feel

scared and so I'm trying to just like be

transparent about first timing the first

time I ever played D&D was on stream 2

so you guys are just experiencing

everything with me so this will be the

first well this will be the second

episode I almost killed my usual DM on

Miss clicks by making him fall out of a

tree it was very satisfying I hope that
