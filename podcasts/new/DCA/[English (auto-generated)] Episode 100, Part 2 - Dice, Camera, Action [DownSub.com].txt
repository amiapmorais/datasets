hi I'm Chris Perkins I'm your Dungeon

Master for this next installment of

waffles incorporated and to my left

we've got not your grandma's grandma

Rosie bee stinger I'm gonna just adjust

my telescope here my new Deana

Christopher burger Oh finally a quality

DM at this table

let's have Rasmus and to my left most

left carrying the weight of the world on

his shoulders per usual D F Woodrow Oh

to my right emerging is it from a mister

out it's good wrist round to my super

right the trashiest of trash witches

everything's real bad they're just in

fun if we don't get bits or charges on

this show on this dumpster show be nice

to my dumpster it's super stinks it's

our dumpster seem to be dumpster fire

all right we are in water deep folks the

waffle crew recently acquired a large

mansion in the city's North Ward which

is actually one of the nicer Lords of

Waterdeep and it's a four-story

magnificent edifice that has it been

various times been a residence a tavern

an orphanage and various other sundry

things and they're in the process of

fixing it up

when Strix receives a message in her hat

Damon so I hate that I think question is

what the jury do with it now what hey

Jerry Duke could this be the message

even message let me check and remember

to write my note that's it go a definite

that's a code for this trash that's not

the message some are so while we wonder

where the message has gone

probably likes a I love evil and evil

and has received her own missive and

because of that missive has been led

away by paltin on some grand adventure

of their own leaving dia and Strix alone

in the Waffle House no we have no anyway

then it becomes soft and you take it off

and there's a crumpled up piece of paper

inside alright

I'm first my words Dave damn I got a

letter from Roman has this evylyn and

Bolton still back at the house there's

already gone ok so I'd imagine death had

returned just shortly before this

missive showed up and he walked in he's

probably carrying whatever normal

supplies he does in his morning errands

and he's used to walking back in and

hearing evil and yell from some other

room and that didn't happen this time

right so he is automatically just like

the hell you do feel the weight of your

burden lifted as the unseen servants in

the house begin to like grab the milk

jug and walk that away you just sort of

unleash your burdens at the door and

they take everything away yeah telling

you like a head scratch like I'll rub

the heck with she have gone

I'm treads none alright yeah then you

don't see paltin behind the bar either

which is strange his chair is empty

which is even strange well he's more of

a wild card I can't protect him at all

yeah well strikes just runs it says

darest drinks I hope this letter finds

you well and that you're half so novel

and one one wrist and its manufacturer

was close at hand you told me once that

should I need help in the future I need

not summon you by means of the infernal

contract capitalized I had but add to

ask so let's try it I am attempting in

my way to ask for your help I will be

sending two of my best

your way rosy bee stinger versed in the

ways of shadow and it says Donner

Blitzen but I think the you means kiss

race drop-off is but I would very like

it much if you could show them around

the town itself for a bit to learn its

quirks dangers and it's odd sense would

you be so kind

oh man if it's Hereward drawn cool I

mean I've met them they're nice we can

hang out with them whatever it is that

Ullman wants

no thank you do you know where palton

are I searched the house about 17 times

and I don't think they're in the rafters

are under it or outside and no one's

outside dad so no is Simon and waffle

still here

they're about doing their things yes I

don't know you probably hear waffles in

the upstairs den stomach am didn't say

go did they go on a date did they leave

us oh no I'm sure it's nothing they get

kidnapped

there's probably probably something

weird like pulp is gonna go play a gig

or something and get some more money in

deeply oh that's gotta be where they are

I bet you they're starting a new tour

and he's trying to make us more money so

that we can fix the house more and take

away evil and ugly decorations that she

put up yeah yeah you're probably right

did they say when they're gonna arrive

don't I don't dare to say bye

I meant the others rosy mattress I just

through the nose cut to rosy cthis you

are standing outside

Northgate the northern gate of water

deep water deep is surrounded by tall

walls and this gate you can see a large

crowd of people lined up to enter the

city and they're all being checked /

searched by members of the City Guard as

they pass through the gates you're just

standing in the line great

it's like airport security yeah one day

safely I have nothing to hide all right

so ladies kind of smell coming off the

sea the ocean like that's yeah now back

up from medium what did Amon tell us to

make us come to water deep why are weird

you got the sense that something was

going down in red larch that was

immensely important to omen and that he

didn't want to share with you because it

was of a personal nature so Rosie is

pissed she's she's been fuming this

whole exactly and it's just the same the

same crap over and over again that she's

been saying tika thrist on this how long

two day journey yeah and so it's just

been arms folded like what does it mean

what does it mean I can't be I can't be

trusted some kind of like romantic

liaison I'm amazing at that I'm an

incredible matchmaker you see me do it

this is this is I mean alarming is not

even the word this is insulting frankly

you should be I am thank you thank you

you're the making you're the one of us

that's good at that I know absolutely

but if I were you I would be actually

glad I came to Waterdeep at Oman's best

once and I lost my mind immediately I

think I could have been level 10 by now

but here we are glad because he's

sending us away from whatever he's doing

that's probably for the best

I just I've I saved Batman when he

turned into a little child I protected

him and he's just very ungrateful you've

made it up to the guards it's been like

45 minutes we're still having the same

and they just sort of looking up and

down I see that you're not sort of

bedecked in steel or armor or anything

so they sort of forego any kind of steel

tax on you and they just brush you

through okay and you're not carrying any

wares or you know and anything per se so

other than your staff and your snake

which actually they don't even then

Blanche a weird creature water deep

they've seen it all this you know I'm

Neela Gatti's come in here every day

dozens guards also hear about how pissed

off I am they definitely that message

gets through loud and clear yeah I just

love that there's massive like crowds

and heads and then you just see this

starting the sea with a wave of her

staff it's the exact image it's all mud

down here in the northernmost district

of Waterdeep it's called the field ward

it used to be a marshaling area where

there were no real structures per se but

it's the the poorest of the poor have

kind of built up a town here and it's

all steeped in and it reeks and it

stinks but there is a clear Boulevard

that winds its way up to an inner wall

perched atop a plateau that has its own

gate and you go through the same process

again only you've shed a bunch of you

know people along the way and you can

see through the gates a clean just

pristine city awaits you on this higher

ground and as you make your way through

it

everything seems all to get everybody

seems much better dressed there's less

crowding people slamming into you

accidentally and their fancy coaches

2-person Handsome's and sometimes even

bigger coaches making their way along

boulevards and rosie takes all this in

visually and she's quiet for a second

she looks around she says and I should

be the one to get to meet her

I should be the one to meet her I'm

going whose opinion matters we could go

back

there's nothing fully we're given what I

want refseq I had that too like the

driver on a handsome sure yeah I think

bears you as quickly as possible through

the city and now you're having the

conversation this has been like our 52

very patiently encouraging I think that

some of the the frustration would begin

to come out but has like and I told you

it's a good thing I told you it's a good

thing primordial I speak whatever

language you wanted in you say it to me

in various languages yeah it's an old

proverb and it means that this is a good

thing

yeah you know what a my old my favorite

proverbs us mmm

they say this where I'm from two hands

cannot stretch a hat and that's what

makes me so mad right now

I agree I'd be furious that's incredibly

disappointing like trying to puzzle out

what it could mean it was like a shock

could stretch it with my two hands

what kind of hats do they make where

she's from you sir looking out there are

crowds of people and many of the women

and men are wearing fancy hats top hats

big bonnets and things you're like

looking at possibility well then maybe

it's one of these kinds of matter yeah

and as you make your way through it is

treading from late afternoon into early

evening it looks like it's gonna be a

fairly pleasant evening a wind is picked

up and it does blow through the streets

and there's not a scrap of garbage to be

found as you are born into the North

Ward down a side street that has this

sort of covered stone archway that you

pass through in

to what looks like a very very wide

alley but not a crappy dark dank alley

hey I'm kind of low-rent absolutely

tight alley this and this alley has nice

cobbles and there are a few children

playing in in one part of the alley and

then some halfling musicians on the

corner and another part of the alley and

all the buildings though tall and

casting large shadows are stately well

manicured brick edifices with vines

growing up their sides and eventually

you come to a structure perched on the

corner of the alley that the driver says

is where you intend to be and it is this

somewhat dilapidated but you can see

probably in better days it would have

been a very very fine establishment and

some effort has been made recently to

improve its outer appearance although

there's a bit of schizophrenic its

credit quality to its rehabilitation

okay so how much do you change

contractors yeah you don't run into

trouble like this and strict's and death

you hear a wrapping up the door what is

this and timing to us receiving and

reading the letter is a life just

moments later like I'm it's so perfectly

yeah I would say he would have timed it

really well and the wrapping that you

hear at the door is time is the enemy

the passive noise in the barn you answer

the door with your sword out I'm not

gonna doubt but all right ideas will

approach the front door I'm hiding

behind or my staff you can still see my

staff come and like hang on his belt but

it's actually gripping around Moon

splinter all right and then you'll like

open up and answer the door and the

seeketh wrists and Rosie and then almost

immediately I guess relieved in a sense

senator departing wagon yeah

yes was like I hate how well his timing

Rosie's face yeah is she's she's like

this mask of consternation still and

then she sees you she's like oh hello

dear oh good to see you sweetheart thank

you

how nice Rosie is so pleasant to see you

were wonderful do you thing almost kind

of he's like not like really on Babel

it's like a gentle like that's not

necessary she has your staff her staff

and she just pushes she still hears it

she's like Stanford to make sure she's

not a super nice to have a perspex you

put these down the other hand and reach

out to charisma Kath risk citrus boughs

very deeply to you Oh greetings friend

thrist it's excellent to see you again

please come in well I'm gonna show you

the same hospitality that you so kindly

showed me standing to not stabbing

strikes you can if you want it's your

house as a period you kind of like the

the darkness of this place there's not a

lot of light inside except what comes

through the windows and you can see it

is an old tap room it's it's bigger than

the the one in red larch it's got a big

heavy looking stone fireplace that kind

of stands by itself you can sort of walk

past either side of it into the deeper

recesses of the tap room behind the bar

you see a staff poking up with this

black Crescent that looks familiar it's

all fine okay I know you just want to

make sure you were the real you we've

had problems you know I'm just saying

it's actually very sound thinking well

did we get a table

we have a table okay do we have a table

at our first floor room so in the top

room there are four tables there is only

large rectangular table in sort of an

alcove in one corner and then there are

three smaller more intimate tables with

three chairs yeah did you like the

smaller circular tables that's kind your

the window yeah yeah I liked I'll

gesture cthe wrists and Rosie just kind

of take a seat there and do me they will

pull out chairs for them

take a seat Andres you see flagons of

ale float over toward you and set

themselves down on the table they're not

they're not poltergeists mother could be

but they're more like unseen servants

it's magic we don't know who's managed

maintain the place that came with it was

a help some whole solder and if you have

a very soft one of those I do I have one

i draped with a class in the velvet not

the cloth the unseen servant you guys

want pies no I would love a pie dear

all right Strix we'll go to the kitchen

and the unseen servants like about and

she's like don't you dare as you look

around you see that while they've taken

some strides to clean up the place there

are still kind of spiderwebs clinging in

various corners the drapes are still

ratty and worn they haven't been

replaced yet and there is kind of like a

smell they do perhaps Oh notices the

gaze is going around it's like we

haven't been here very long we're

working on it

sorry I know I know you guys been here I

know you guys are here for a reason

I know you were sent but before any of

that Chris your research how's it going

Oh incredibly well is it yes

the the rings are safe and I believe

that they will be used if we can

recreate a Bustani wedding ritual I

think that might be what frees the

remaining pieces of your friends soul

here from the kitchen I only have one of

them was me my associate walnut has the

other okay she comes back and she's like

holding the pie but like half of its

falling off it's like falling apart it's

like why just be safe with them would be

safe with yourselves it's it's hard you

never know if this tiny stuff it's hard

to trust it but I'm glad things are

proceeding well oh I hate it

what could go wrong at her weddings wait

she puts the pie down and just sits on

some plates Flo well there's some life

floats over anything's in the air

well either way so long as it's helping

you and doing a greater good I think

will help all of us amazing

that's so relieving to hear Terry starts

talking to herself going there are two

chairs and we were holding hands and

there was someone and then there was a

priest and she's like all right the idea

have been turned over to Rose he's like

and Rosie was Olman want faith darkest

storm cloud passes at Chris she was so

happy this for five seconds she's like

all I know is omen wanted to have some

kind of visit from someone and you

wouldn't tell me who it was he just told

me that it was very important that I not

be there because I'm a meddler because

I'm the kind of person who could ruin it

and Chris - I am the kind of person that

could really yes genuinely yes you guys

are nice you don't ruin things I know in

things yes that's what I said we do our

best

yeah he said it was it was some uh he

said the word he was he was talking

about Lysander do you remember this yeah

that's that's what I remember is that or

even some there's some woman that he

won't let me meet because she is too

pure to be corrupted by my presence I

think were his exact words

it was very upset Faison Santa then

because I mean if she's uncorruptible

and after we possibly Nami maybe if it's

getting really bad look at him yeah are

you all right is it the pie it's not

very good it's not very good and this

she looks at strict she says what you

sell them tears too much

nice save Rosie they are terrible what

was going on you can hear some Jamaican

lumbering upstairs banging and slamming

around

that's just waffles our Albert do you

want to meet her it's probably feeding

time about right now I've got a couple

of dead rabbits out in the back I would

love to meet her you head upstairs there

is an upstairs den with a turret on one

corner and it's been turned into this

giant play room with all of these

stuffed toys that Strix is sort of

hastily stitched together you can see

the drapes have been ripped down off the

walls there are claw marks in old

furniture that is slowly being torn

apart a big overstuffed armchair that

has seen better days and a big mound of

crap in the middle of the turret that

somebody has made into a big padded bed

and then there's also a big outlet all

eight have nine foot long grey feathered

albear stomping around oh goodness

and it comes barreling toward you kids

to a stop right in front of your face oh

okay and licks you with a big sandpaper

tongue this is this is a very nice owl

bear rosie is two feet 11 and a half

inches far she has our bears next factly

fine we ate her mom I'm sorry

relax I wanna feed her yeah I'm a rabbit

okay a whole rabbit okay

does does waffles do any tricks on her

hind legs so now she's like 11 feet tall

that's a good trick or a trick okay I

don't think I don't really

I'll just just tell her tell her to dab

and then she'll do something okay that

she's lying on her back with a big

clawed feet kicking up in here oh that's

lovely

Rosie we'll go drop the rabbit I'm ready

yeah and rub the belly so you two are

here to just be out of the way while

Ullman does whatever he wants with

Evelyn yeah oh that's the long and short

of it that's the thing are we

babysitter's that makes sense now if we

can help it we should go to read large

the last thing I want is for omen to be

alone with you Blanc but they just saw

here we can take we should take him at

least a great scream and maybe like

chair con wait did Pulitzer I think so

we don't know that

oh I guess I got he must have I gave him

a Christmas present the Christmas

present last year but he was very drunk

and he doesn't remember any of it I

believe remember I still draw those have

been matching sweaters for him as right

does Simon here do you guys want to say

hi to Simon yeah yeah where's Simon

Simon so they're all bare no he's not

all there

he'd be on chances are either the level

above or the level above that please

good for him

goodness Colin he likes to wander on the

house I'm sure if you see him out and

about he'll give you a friendly hello

you hear them or a dart in the net Tom

Simon no they start calling out for

Simon then there is a sound of shattered

glass as one of the windows downstairs

breaks I knew Simon Simon and then you

hear we

I don't know I just I'm gonna rats

downstairs yeah she turns into a pile of

rats

ah okay rats yeah she does a diff again

we'll have like hand on blade just kind

sure it's I'm sure it's fine it's

perfectly hiss pitiable here just I'm

sure I'm sure is fine you like worried

leave like follows jerks like Oh God Oh

when you head down you make your way

back into the tap room you see the

creature responsible for coming through

you see that a creature has come through

the window mm-hmm

it is a sphere about two feet in

diameter with little spindly legs on

little spindly arms and a pair of little

vestigial metal wounds and it's got one

big eyeball it's staring at you and it

makes machine noises as it stomps around

[Laughter]

[Music]

and looks like that yeah it just seems

we're looking around nervously a little

monocle sort of coming in and out of its

vision and it says over we when we as

Deena's coming down the stairs and like

the moment he sees this thing he just me

they almost weird this is a very rare

sight baby lose his composure and me

like stop itself there's like stumbling

back up the stairs and like cos lift

down a little bit use his hand like go

back up the stairs well just to get back

upstairs no way from this thing and not

be seen yeah this is rats so if she sees

him do that she's just gonna like go

back and just like start pushing him up

his rats up the stairs suddenly your

hosts are retreating uh yeah the stairs

I guess Rosie would then shadow stuck

into you lights like a pile of shadow

whatever's whatever's back up the stairs

she'd be she beast shadow seven back

okay um if we get do we get back into

the room with waffles yeah

okay waffles is immediately missed in

the jar okay you turn your giant albear

into a cloud of mist and then it goes

into your little jar yeah

so dad's anymore so no rats let's take

back up the stairs

I think I'm not I haven't gone far

enough down to see that but when

everybody's retreating up I'm gonna last

to go up I just watched them as though

it's customary like okay alright you are

now all hiding upstairs and waffles them

so there are two balconies off the den

by the way yeah so as this is happening

in DFC strix ghosts form

waffles he like started just like

looking over the balconies and they kind

of checking the heights and looking

around kinda like pacing back around the

room and basically is only addressing

Strix right now as he's talking about

and strategizing and formulating a plan

basically saying because the second

floor is only it's not very high up from

no it's about like 20 feet up off the

ground yeah and I know there's an under

area yeah there's also like a crawl

space in the house we could all go into

the crawl space yeah this is part of the

tour there Anna King there's like okay

they do this week I've ever seen a mod

Ron I don't think so we're very you

could I mean you could ask yeah they

just look panicked I think I think

that's like should be like hold on

what's why are you guys so afraid of

this dumb robot I'll have to explain

later

for now Strix if thing comes through

this we can easily get off the second

roof I can make my way across the

rooftops

you take waffles with you and just hide

stay in a bad form where we gonna do

like snow easily out of your rubber you

can if I need you all right up so they

can fly I can fly on a broom they can

fly they'll see me then find somewhere

to hide out you know where the

undersides are just check into the

sewers if I need to I can make sure I'm

not I'm not I'm not I can't know if it

sees you to it and won't matter like

they're not looking for you

yeah go go tell it that no one lives

here I'm I'm in fun infamous criminal -

it's not this is different well then

I'll talk to it

nobody wants anything to do with me

alright

creeping downstairs yeah and now I I

will I will march down stairs

nonchalantly see gems from you see this

thing for the first time and she sort of

stomping around in a little kind of

figure eight in in in the middle of the

taproom and it seems agitated and it

seems to be talking a little bit faster

than before we will I will not approach

any closer okay and I'll say I'm I'm

sorry

I already gave at the office we don't

need any thank you does not seem to

acknowledge you at all

I'll come a little bit closer it's just

like hello friend

machine friend this is a private

residence and I guess it's not breaking

entering if it's an otamatone maybe it's

this sort of a function of this city

are you asking the motor on yeah and

speaking a lot I don't care whether or

not it answers so you creep a little bit

closer to it it does not seem to react

to you it does occasionally actually

kind of dart its little eye toward you

but it continues on this sort of figure

eight little March that is doing and it

just keeps talking faster and faster we

will yeah I want to reach out okay so

i'll crane my head back upstairs to just

glance up at you yeah and a week and

mine right

it's barely responding to me okay but it

is getting faster yeah what are you come

on back up here we can make our way out

of this place okay I don't think this is

a friend that you want to have say just

a moment

we'll excuse me you get upstairs when

the we wooing stops and there is a

whoosh as there is a massive explosion

on the floor below you the entire

building just shakes and trembles and

then the floor underneath you explodes

upward I need you all to make Dexter 17

427 15 15 16 16 17 okay you none of you

take any damage as Flinders fly up in

your face

bits of wall and stone blast past you

and you're basically sent careening back

into the walls lasted three episodes

there's just smoke everywhere gives

getting up anyways smoking let's pause

is everyone all right can i press

digitation work to get rid of the smoke

you didn't you can do a little bit oh

it's just like a little puff here a

little puff there zone way too much

smoke too much smoke

yeah I'm just like I'm trying and you

can see down below there was lots of

shattering glass sounds and other noises

and things but you can't see anything to

flame I assume yes there are pockets of

fire everywhere okay we should get out

of this building because it's gonna be

it's gonna collapse

so there's balconies off of waffles

right there is a balcony this room is

sort of on a corner of the house and so

there's a balcony on the north side of

the house and on the west side of the

house we still the west side of the

house is toward the alley I want to

actually check downstairs real quick

just to see if it's actually on fire and

how much structural damage it is if it

seems like it could collapse under the

weight of itself okay

making a perception check with

disadvantage because of the smoke yeah

that's fair okay

a27 okay yeah you can see through that

this building is not in danger of

collapse okay the damage was pretty much

localized to the tap room and the common

room directly above it which is adjacent

to the room you're in right so it looks

like two rooms may have been badly

damaged by this and you can see already

efforts are being taken by the unseen

servants to use like thank you girls

down drapes and things to smother flames

thank you just be like it's alright

we're okay the building's okay

everyone's okay

it didn't see us so we're okay yeah it's

nice right it's a really nice real nice

destroy the episodes then Kristen OOP

did this thing came to murder you it's a

long story do you want me to call it in

like really quick and Chilton language

is where I get really scared so those

are from single I don't feel worse they

always it's really bad place it's rosie

would like to peek the balcony and see

what's what's feeling strange okay you

can see standing out in trolls skull

alley a clear of the building back aways

are four creatures three of them are

encased in rusty red plate armor with

all sorts of spikes coming off of them

okay one of those figures is doing the

top and imagine if you will a female

Russian bodybuilder yeah encased in

plate armor with all these spikes scars

covering her face just like Criss

crosses of scars all over her face if he

has hair you can't see because she's

just got this sort of helmet on with

these flanges coming off the back of it

and next to her is a smaller mercy

killer this this red clad spiky plaited

guy who looks like an old man okay and

is literally sort of buckling under the

weight of the armor that he's in okay

but he is holding a banner with a red

flag okay

and the third armored figure is not

quite as sort of halfway between the

smaller man and the bigger woman yeah

and he has some sort of disease or

something because most of his face is

just this pox okay you can barely make

out any features and he has his helmet

in his just basically tucked under his

arm and then puts it on his head okay

the fourth figure looks like a old crone

okay hmm

in robes and on her head is a tall hat

that looks like a clock tower oh and she

holds a staff that seems to be making

whirring noises okay the big woman who's

addressing you has what appeared to be a

set of manacles in her male fist and

there are there are people in neutral

scholarly scattering just like yeah at

their at their arrived so let's check is

gone where are you you found she just

stumbled back upstairs she's just trying

to find deer okay and you're you are

downstairs I had looked it downstairs I

wasn't actually down there okay as soon

as she heard her name she just like went

to go find him okay yeah all right so

Rosie then would pull back from the

alley and turn tickets arrested be like

we should find another place to stay

good read large yeah yeah

what this is this sucks right yes you're

up here right still yeah and do you know

I mean I can tell by looking at you that

you know what's going on down there

I just would ask are they gonna explode

- is that what's gonna happen it's just

gonna be wave after wave of Snowden

creatures no that would actually be

merciful of them what they do what they

represent and why they're here is a far

worse fate than anything that you may

even imagine because this goes in Rob

Rosie you see outside the the elderly

man in the mail armor looks up at the

big woman that says maybe it's or not oh

oh yeah I think we're not gonna say okay

should go on we gonna afters we can go

image inside the house is this Rathore's

it also the hatch down to the wine

cellar there's a way that we can hide or

disguise the hatch and they can't find

it I can do that we just hide out hey I

can do that with something could we come

out and say like you've got the wrong

 house idiots I mean we could do

exactly that and see how what happens

yeah I feel like Rosie would do that

listen whatever reason they're here

they're not here for you whatever you do

do not engage do not fight do not pose a

threat

don't touch back don't even show that

you have any capabilities just leaning

more don't pose a threat I'll talk to

them my spineless friend here will take

care of my legs fitting that I'm

literally like pulling up the floorboard

where I keep all my stuff just like yes

I think if there's a big enough area

down here for us to hide we can hide

under the floor here and they might not

know we're here

yeah you guys you guys go ahead and hide

let's see if we can cause it let's let's

go down all right yeah you and me and I

will get under the floor yeah you guys

get under the floor I like that plan

okay

okay okay yeah why there and we'll stay

quiet and just in what I'm going to say

if you guys have to let us know

so you creep in to your little cubby

between the floors between the first and

the second floor and then you hear

threats and rosy making their way down

the staircase Strix do you have any kind

of illusions or you can do to help hide

us while we're in here or anything just

to I can turn us both up both in the

clouds they can still see clouds yeah

I can't it but they can't arrest a cloud

yes I don't know I can oh I can press to

digitate some dirt on top of us I mean

just like no one will see it did you can

you like thick additional floorboards or

something in between the cracks there's

like no low I can cast darkness down

here you won't see any better all right

and at the same time be ready to miss

you step in whatever direction we need

to just get away Diezel take I can take

you in a dimension door we if we need to

go we can both dimension door out okay

that's already that will do that and

darkness okay

so the darkness is a magical effect that

would extend out the only force wearing

black robes let's just hide under my

brother my robes just like there's

enough of it we'll just curl into a ball

and just go under the roads if they're

black if you guys snuck up yes yeah yeah

yeah it's very tight in here but you

know yeah like like physically close no

one's having fun here Diaz has moon

splinter out and like just making sure

he has a tune with it and then the his

other hand is the Jackie grabs

he takes tricks his hand and just hold

on to it just like ready to Dimension

Door now so he's already then ready to

go with her mmhmm yeah she holds on to

and she's just like shaking like yeah

I'm under the floorboards none of what

you guys see no no

you guys make your way down through the

smoke and the the smothering flames

Rosie is leaning heavily the role that

she is already like you and I have

probably talked about this before but

she's like you're the manservant she is

she is leaning very very heavily on you

and playing very elderly obviously she

doesn't never staff because she'd given

it to do okay yes so then we go and we

open the door you come out through the

front door down the stairs to confront

these four figures what what what's

happening here what could she she comes

up with some nonsensical drow name for

you

Dritz i am a very weak drow a manservant

and i will find out how you him what has

happened to our horrible home you can

tell right away that the the armored

figures are just looking at each other

and shrugging their male shoulders like

and the woman that seems frustrated and

she pulls out a piece of paper actually

and double-checks it papers say that you

were cleared to do that she just sort of

crumpled it up and she says who I am I'm

a humble man sir the drill 20 is this

some kind of is that an a type of a oh

I've not heard of it if it good you can

see while this is going on the city

watch is now converging through

basically all the passageways that lead

here and coming in there must be at

least a dozen that you see advancing

toward this location and the mercy

killer see it too and she turns to the

pox-ridden one

and the parks written one about old man

looks up at them and says oh this this

is a city it's probably defended these

things slip between the cracks and then

the woman just tells the PAC's word and

one just says guys kill them whoa he go

stomping off toward the guards oh my

gosh by himself well just sort of pulls

out a great axe says we are looking for

two plain of criminals

their names are strict for D F Woodrow

criminals hey I hear some of the they

must be and she turns to the old crone

with the clock tower happened she

doesn't the Crone doesn't she says

something but her voice is like great

okay peace I'm here and when she looks

look at her she's not quite in the same

space all the time like she's slipping

in and out of time

you gotta love that right and the big

woman says I can't understand a word she

says

do you can kiss make a deception check

Oh

enjoy your aiding him saying I get

advantage on her oh action Oh YUM okay

so that's gonna be a that's a nineteen

and not a 19-15 okay you get the

impression that the you can't really get

a read on the old crome at the clock

tower hat she's weirdly alien to you but

the old man seems to believe you and is

genuinely confused and actually kind of

embarrassed the the pox-ridden guys gone

off so you don't really get a read on

him she is doubtful that she believed

she is she has a certainty that this

must be right this cannot be wrong which

means you must be lying to her

she can't wreck it she hasn't quite

reconciled everything yet I I can tell

you that they they aren't in there now

but you may want to destroy the adjacent

houses we could we can try to help ah

that is a good idea huh Oh what do they

look like maybe we've seen them the old

man says well Strix is this weird

amalgamation of tiefling and trash

dressed all in black with a tall pointy

hat oh and sometimes flies around on a

broom oh yeah the other one is a skinny

lad young okay full of hope and destiny

and has a soul unlike the rest of his

kind Wow all right I would definitely

remember those two but they are accused

of attempting to destroy the multiverse

Oh their family signed an ancient

compact millennia old saying that they

would never ever come together again ah

yes they have defied that contract is

about to be knocked off its axis

oh well that's we would never allow such

criminals anywhere near our ancestral

home that we've had for generations but

I'd never

I love it here as well it's just you've

just been like all of these years

and I feel she does this from time to

time wake up wake up what's the player

what are you doing I'm trying to be dead

just go with it just try to act

really stressed out and start crying

start crying I'm really dead and I

disadvantaged on crying is this not

gonna happen because this would would be

like the stiff upper lip of the dancers

like yes she is done yeah her time is

gone what a grand adventure it was pull

me back inside

I shall dispose of her sorry to have

wasted your time

I will eat everything including the box

the holy man turns to the big woman in

armor and says we we must have come at

the wrong time maybe they inherit this

place after the old woman died it's her

fault pong and they look at the old

crone in the clock tower and she makes

nonsensical noises all right I just

pulled me inside I just have dragged you

in okay what shall I cook first I mean

while you guys are being dragged away

you could hear that this this one mercy

killer who walked away has basically

engaged in battle with the city watch

and as you sort of cracked an eye open

Rosie before you were dragged inside you

saw that there must be at least 30 City

Watchmen yes you were just ganging up on

this guy did they look like they got a

shot again still more he he seems to be

holding his own okay and that's the

worst that's a terrible crime in water

deep like this yeah it's just he's gonna

yeah that's that's you know Sheldon it's

real bad you know it's a worst crime

wrecking the multiverse do these two

seem like they're capable of that really

come on I sign something they die don't

a piece of the ceiling just sort of

falls

let's get the ass out of here

I think we've caused enough chaos that

we can yeah safely escape okay I agree

so let's go back up - oh boy

yeah hi do you all I don't I got to make

your way up to the smoldering staircase

that's sort in my face yeah you got the

knot I think we can probably use our

voices although we could be simulacra

again oh let's then we hear are you

arguing now they're standing on top of

it no there's Todd sighs actually you

can hear sounds of swordplay outside

yeah what are they doing they're still

here but they're not looking at you as

hard anymore so I think we can get out

of here if they're distracted maybe we

can make our way through the streets

right I mean for all their whatever

nonsense I'm sure I can lead us through

the back alleys a little manual here

outside say hey we should just go this

has been this has all been a mistake

maybe they went with the others to read

larch we're laughs I'm fourth is there -

and then she says I like the drought

suggestion destroy everything let them

destroy the city

we can't I only told him to destroy this

block

do you have silicon puts on a hand I

made two rival floorboards at this point

yeah we just feel Todd puts a hand up to

kind of stretch everyone as he's like

kind of trying to listen to see if he's

hearing from where he is like the sounds

are heavy rusted armor where they're

stepping if they're they don't hear much

armor except the clash going off over

there down the alley between the three

but you do hear this sound like perhaps

they are going through the fabric of

tech space and something is going

through the fabric okay sometime

and then you hear we

[Laughter]

inside you hear you hear multiple blues

from multiple creatures outside stomping

around and fluttering little wings

outside have to get out the house you

have to go we have to have to go do you

want to go in there we giggle in the

roofs I'll just get on my broom you jump

across the roofs but I can fly us

excellent wait what why cool Rosie fine

I'll just attach myself okay yeah all

right we have to go let's go up the

turret yeah use clear of climb out of

the thing you get your together and

then you hear a barrage of spell effects

go off magic missiles thunder waves and

the we Woo's are sort of blasted into

silence Oh

are they the serpent I'm still making

our way up to the turn because that so

leads to the outside yeah and they're

like a race wall of sorts that we can

kind of the turret is actually an

enclosed structure it's got a cap on its

roof okay but you can basically go into

Paul Pan's room and then the lower the

turret off of his room

you can peer out into the windows and

see that that pox-ridden guy has been

sort of swarmed and it's kind of being

pummeled on by a bunch of city guards

and there are wizards in the air and on

the ground just blasting the out of

the other ones like they they run the

gamut okay cool you can see that there

is a the one that's closest to the

building is a dwarf Wizard and she's got

a high flaring caller I love it heavy

thick robe and she's the one I'm just

thunder waved and sent the mercy killers

backward tongue home nun as it's

happening like they're all watching with

the window DFS still going to get to the

top of the turret to find Simon okay you

can see that he comes down from there's

like a compartment in this roof of the

turret he comes down out of that at this

point in time okay yeah and I'm sort of

surprised to see you up here yeah and

like

most sincere earnest scared face like

Simon has probably ever seen if he can

register that human expression yes it

feels like come here saying we gotta go

we gotta go we gotta go find paltin we

got to get out here we need to keep you

safe

and basically motions to like lift Simon

up and carry him like a child

oh okay yeah

he will come let's sort of stare back up

into the turret and then look down at

you and come down into your arms yeah

he'll dance we'll kind of take it in

maybe like close to hoist him up bunt

like a single shoulders he's like

sitting there he's got an arm up you see

that Simon butt is a three-foot-tall

animated wooden puppet in a Jester

Costume is he wearing like Ronnie dia

this Dilek just wigs I want to get him

out of here fast

so from here I guess still what the

Wizards are here we don't need to leave

they're fighting for us yeah if they can

dry them off then we don't need to

retreat but for some reason they fail we

need to have that moment we can be ready

but what's the what's the magic can I

can I ain't rats and check the magic

that's going on in our house like was

there magic in our house too because the

we was stopped yeah when you look out

through the windows of the turret we can

see the the we was stopped and there are

a bunch of destroyed mo drones lying out

on the street where they must have

gotten like blasted with magic missiles

or something they didn't get very far

yeah so he didn't make it into a

building right they didn't make it into

any of the buildings that they were sent

off to ghosts I don't know what the two

of you intend to do but I

we've all heard them they were sending

more forces to read large yeah and we do

not have wizards and a city guard like

this that's yeah we don't have anything

close to this we're kind of it you hear

the big woman say get us out of here for

the old crone so you guys are good seems

alright here until Waterdeep finds out

that this was us that God as the as the

old crone with the clock tower

waves her staff around the field around

her about a 20-foot radius area you can

see is different from the rest of the

city it's like nighttime and there's

snow on the ground well like she has

she's taking herself to a different time

cool and then she and the two Mercy

Killers closest to her blink out of

existence they leave the third one

behind and you can see that he has been

completely beaten down and swarmed by

the city guard is he still gonna just

get decimated right now I'd like to say

he's actively been disarmed and pinned

down to the ground oh yeah like that

doing Arcana check maybe to know who

that what that woman was with her magic

yeah you can cuz i I've never seen that

before I mean I might have seen that I

don't know I just wanted maybe like I

know that's 18 you think she might be a

crow no man sir and we've seen those

before yeah yeah but she's human not not

correct okay yes yeah she wasn't uh she

was a girl instructors - no she was a

human do I know that they work for the

Mercy Killers though and they hired guns

for the mercy killers you don't know

okay

all I know is I don't want to touch it

so what did both of you do that they're

coming after you we didn't do anything

what sounded like your family's had some

kind of contract money ago and you guys

weren't supposed to hook up and then you

were like Tomasz backup means it's a

normal function of her no it's not it's

not we didn't we haven't done that hmm

[Laughter]

we didn't do that strikes just starts

crying is there any chance that you guys

may have I don't know come close to

wrecking the multiverse that don't ring

a bell it doesn't we've never done that

oh okay uh well well look we didn't know

this but the third two families were in

her planar families and it

don't understand maybe he's an angel

person we don't know not an angel person

no no we don't know look they make a lot

of bold claims but none of them are true

I know who I am where I come from do ya

I think the onus of proof is on them

seems it's not right it's not not did

you bowl well Trobe Esquire I'm talking

is mumbling she's like there's also a

family that is it's called the Skiz

exceed and apparently they're no they're

not you're right they're not but they're

trying to kill us okay all right well

that doesn't sound good I like you

better than I like them so we are not

gonna let that happen

how's that thank you Matt it's nice

knowin ya more importantly though if

they want to send forces of red large

everyone there's in danger if evylyn is

there she's gonna try to fight it yeah

what's the play huge guys just always

hide until they leave well no I mean the

last time they showed up we killed one

those shackles are anti-magic shackles

they make you not be able to use magic

have you ever not been able to use magic

Catherine I was level three fruit you

can still use magic I can only imagine

yeah I so there's one left and the one

that's been beaten yeah are we as we're

conversing what's the city guard are

they like letting up are they taking a

minute when you look outside to see sort

of get an update on the status of this

thing you realize as you were kind of

swept up in your little conversation

that they the guards and this mercy

killer have been swallowed up by fog Oh

miss a guard and the mercy killers will

follow up by fog you see just the one

you just see sort of billowing fog

spilling into the

Alley is it everything we can see it's

being obscured by it yes

do we see that yeah as you peer through

the dirty not know do we does their we

need to run from it does I need to run

their source no it seems to be coming

from every direction would you call it

an unseasonable fog yes mmm okay the way

that it seems to move around corners

almost it's almost like ghostly hands

pulling itself into the alley no good

okay see what they do

what's the destination top strikes to

seize it is just too scared she's just

gonna stand there she's just too scared

in fact it dances there she's just gonna

hog him oh boy she's just hugging BS

she's too scared you said you had a

broom can you fly a broom she's not even

paying attention that can't fly he can't

fly she's not paying attention and she's

there to standing that's very cool climb

oh boy do you want to just get out of

here

no go and call your technical down yeah

let's go say by the way the Brizzy rosie

usually a little like hop on someone's

back but in Chris's case she's like you

get on back okay so he's like okay so

III cast fly and kisses flavor is that a

slender black tentacle from places

unknown descends from the sky encircles

his waist and he just goes incredibly

limp but still has control going it's

fine no it's limited to Mike strengthen

my carry wait black tentacle is now got

Chris in his clutches and he's got more

or less limp all right

rosie has you on like oh like a

parachute backpack okay alright guys my

ankle meet again we need to get going

Strix strength

can we strength can we can we run from

this we could never run from it I mean

if you guys want to stand here talking

about it yeah you can just do you know

we can't run what do you mean you can't

run from this why run when you could fly

I know this is we've seen it anybody who

wants to can make a narcotic okay she

didn't do so well we know we for this is

this this feels to you like the cloying

mists of Ravenloft we know and you've

excuse you've smell you've sensed to

this all before you know this is this is

a shroud that's sort of descending upon

the world around you

miss rad it is a mist around like why

would you stick around yeah I can't

think of a reason why we would just let

this happen we would we would fly away

tricks and I can't strict and I can't

run from this we've tried before and we

just can't no matter what we do we can

never ever get away from it just like

the mercy killers but you two you can

get out of here fly far away as high up

you can get back to read large find the

others and maybe you can help them but

it's impossible for us to go rosy drops

her Catherine's backpack he falls limply

it makes good sense logical man no I

just said I just literally said two

seconds ago that we're not gonna let

anything happen to them so sounds like

her robes are now just like over her

she's just like put a bunch and she's

just like huddling so now we gotta let

nothing happen to them and rosy doesn't

have any bits or charges because of this

garbage show series I had on the be any

of the next show and she has her charges

back she's gonna the worst meal nerve uh

get her staff back in her hands alright

yeah alright well then I assume it's the

red the explosion yeah yes motion it's

fine I you know it yeah hold on I'll

roll for it yeah it's good

what does the mist do have you ever

heard of a land called burro via ha ha

no it's just would have cut rice is

definitely would have yeah I guess you'd

be curious about it yeah you got if

you're not looking up miss Donny stuff

you've heard of yeah this miss is going

to take us right to there it's

inescapable we get more of these rings

that teleportation oh you don't want no

robos you know what we're into the Rings

that's not something that's in infinite

supply good get them all then grab those

rings let's go dive into the mist 9 9 5

no I'm intrigued and I'm like see your

guys are you're trying to avoid this

mist yes because it's an awful place

imagine that land so constantly dark

that your very soul withers the moment

you step into it whatever fears and

doubts linger within your mind are

brought to the forefront and no matter

what your mind can't unthink them

sounds like yes I think he likes it

that's now let's go that's a refreshing

perspective you can feel as the mist

kind of presses up against the building

the building creaks a little nothing not

in a way that suggests oh my god is

gonna fall in it's just you feel that it

almost seems to groan under its own age

in protest of the mist touching it it's

like a more like an actual pressure yes

exactly it feels like a pressure this

does is the mist selective is everybody

coming in contact with this mist going

there or is it just who it wants I don't

you know because that's why I'm

suggesting you not risk it and just dull

don't listen you know we're destroying

the multiverse what more danger do you

want it you you guys seem to be very

convinced that you're not destroying the

multiverse and frankly I trust you

slightly more than I trust some red

armored fools and all they are the

embodiment of justice so you know they

might

right but I don't want to die right

there not right you guys have never

liked dental fingers if this mist is not

selective and you care anything for the

citizens of the city I would say that if

it the mist will end once it takes you

then we should plunge into it or maybe

you guys should I am kind of curious

about the dish that's the way the mist

works is that you are no longer in the

city oh oh yeah the whole house is

response and the kindest closes his eyes

this says we're already in it we're

there look out the windows DFL demon

look you just kind like gestures out to

the windows I still look the same and

I'm like has now gone from Honda just

curling up on the floor my thoughts that

window what do I see a figure comes up

to you in the ground then you can see

that it is made out of mist mmm

but she is a sort of this woman this

otherworldly beautiful sort of timeless

woman and her eyes sort of lock on to

yours and I'd like you to make a wisdom

saving throw Oh Harris maybe look like

someone that fell off a horse yeah oh

it's a pretty good one that's a 24 it's

all right eighteen by six yeah whatever

connection she was trying to make with

you you would instantly rebuff your

mental shields go up no thank you

her eyes are like looking into your soul

it feels like like pasts the windows of

your eyes into your head and you can see

immediately that you aren't who she

thought you were and she backs off a

little bit and sort of throws herself

back into the mist the thing was looking

for somebody else maybe don't go to the

windows oh I think I know who Oh

probably looking for paltin again oh no

and he's in bed large though where

they're sending merciless killers and

we're stuck here me came in what if it's

the person who previously owned this

house Magnus Magnusson tone this house

forever it's old oh I don't know maybe

well does it look like we're in I'm just

gonna look out the window you see the

mist is pretty thick you don't see any

of the buildings across the way why

would they be looking for pölten well

there was a time this land was once

ruled by a vampire mm-hmm named strawed

and there was a time when we had

returned to here again I was it was a

different time period within the history

of burrow via and they were attempting

to make paltin the new count estrade oh

and they've the mists just really really

want him to give in to his dark side and

be the ruler of this land because these

might be related to him or something we

don't know who might be related to um

it's it's it gets dangerously close each

time it's really tempting but he almost

froze the world once with the ring of

winter Wow hmm so if there's not looking

for us they're looking for him because

they want him to rule this land but do

do that I know and and then also mercy

killers can't get us here I think maybe

do I look enough like your friend that

mist we no no no could you could could

you look enough like their friends yeah

yeah giving you portraiture of him I

mean yeah I guess catharsis never met

paltin before no but I could look like

him if I wanted to go Kay Schulman

describing poster described in the

detail oh yeah do you guys have probably

one on the wall yeah you see as you talk

all the color leech away from all of the

walls and surfaces of the building that

you're in and eventually leach away from

yourselves until you are all in black

and white it's worse than I thought

yeah and that's where I'll stop oh but

since we didn't really natural 20s let's

give away some yeah of course we didn't

roll any net on my show it happens all

the time right all right so what do we

got to give away good yeah tether that

to another number maybe we have a number

winter note bug Neverwinter sure

see Dyson bag and dandy beyond legendary

bundle and one more during the break

okay we will have a short break and then

I will be still here in the DM seat

taking good care of the red larch party

and they don't get their bits the

now live or Rebecca scream in Forgotten

Realms what okay see I'm super happy

that drones go we were around on the D&D

channel for a chance to win a bundle of

I never went to art book and worden

Canaan's Toma fo Milo okay no Milo

parents thought maybe he would the next

game he was on for a second or he was on

trees stay tuned stay tuned
