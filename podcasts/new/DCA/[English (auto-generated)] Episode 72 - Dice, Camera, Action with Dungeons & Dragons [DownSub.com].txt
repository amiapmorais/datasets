you

[Music]

hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action the show word before every

episode and it tries to cheat and

different character things that she

hasn't earned my gosh those are cool

shades you're rockin though a nickel

hey thanks I totally am wearing them for

no reason just to be cool yeah excellent

so I I got a surgery I'm not just trying

to be cool and I can't actually see any

of us were just black blobs

I generally know what colors you guys

are you know

evylyn is exclusively using echolocation

I'm like daredevil I'm seeing you in the

rain oh no that's me yes last time the

waffle crew ventured to the lost city of

or illunga where they did some cool

things with flowers to meet this

Guardian Naga who told them lots of

interesting things including some bad

things that they probably didn't want to

know and but it all ended happily enough

nobody died palton got a blessing of

wound closure that may her main HUD come

in handy in the future and I could see

things that he couldn't see before in

the jungle ghostly shapes and whatnot

buildings that fell to ruin long and go

now rebuilt but the party has left or

illunga

and has spent another I guess three days

now out in the wilderness during which

time palton DF and Strix have lost

another hit point off their map songs oh

just now yep good so your maximums have

gone down yet another point yeah

should we say for the record what our

maximum czar down to or that early the

Riveter if we keep that in a gray area

why won't you let me know okay sure I am

down to 41 okay I am at 47 34 nah man we

suck look I can heal a lot but like

let's chill out guys come on um let's

see during the night

d/f it's your watch you're in the waffle

hut strix is not there where is she

because I haven't know exactly where she

is she looks like based on some of the

stuff that she left behind that she has

wandered off into the jungle you see you

see like a bunch of her stuff is sort of

out on the ground around your little

encampment waffles is sleeping on her

back with her feet sticking up in the

air and nearby and it makes me feel

better she probably turned into a cloud

to not detect anyone to have them not

detect her okay well right away I get

mad at myself and then immediately like

sprint out the lot and look around for

any kind of signs or hearing or okay

okay perception check just maybe

something like I don't know some

scraped off against a leaf or something

you're following her spoor yes

perception 25 yeah as you sort of wander

off you go about maybe a hundred and

twenty feet away from the camp and you

catch something out of the courtier eye

that just looks like a little bit of

greenish witch

fire in the bushes and when you kind of

go over to that direction you can hear

low whispered incantations and then sort

of sequential flashes of green light and

as we poke through the foliage you can

see a dark blob in the jungle that looks

like strix hunched over I imagine she's

taking the two pieces of her broom and

just like smashing them on her and it's

causing like sparks to fly em she's like

and you can see flashes of green light

erupting from the ruins on the Crescent

of the staff

oh okay so it doesn't look like she's in

duress or anything she's she's

definitely under a spit it looks

dolphins like that normal amount of

duress at the moment yeah it looks like

that she least had the courtesy to move

farther away while she was yeah a hissy

fit huh all right

um she looks like she's doing something

and I don't think I should interrupt

because I might ruin whatever this is

it's probably some weird single thing

that she hasn't told me about yeah

and as she hammers the bits of the broom

you can see some of the little residual

magical energy kind of pours out of the

broken parts of the broom around her and

then there's an explosion of green flame

that just blows fur blows her and you

back off your feet I'm like lay on the

ground and as I'm getting up I just kind

of say to myself wow she really knows

magic it's sort of on fire and then you

see her staff is sort of up in the air

spinning around

okay and then suddenly it turns into a

frying pan and goes onto the ground she

still looks okay during all of this

right like she sits up and you can see

there's a little plume of smoke coming

out of the top of her hat okay but she's

like not in pain or anything you're like

no I think she still has control over

whether in my situation is if it turned

into a pan I'm just gonna run up and be

like yeah did it work I'm just like pick

it up and like shake it all right yeah

making our kana check 19 okay what would

you like it to be at this stage oh I

think the first thing I wanted to try

and turn it into was yet well I guess I

was trying for a pie pan okay so it

worked because I guess it was kind of an

accident I was probably just thinking

about pies or something and then like

one of the things ended up being a pie

pan and I'm like cool well I guess

that's what I get for that but I would

like to turn it into the more impressive

thing which I was planning which was

turning it back into a flying broom but

a really cool one with like a black like

bright and just like a cool like black

egg with like like a crescent moon on

the front and stuff what's your kind of

chick result oh when did you that whoops

that's a three so three four five six

that's older than 11 eleven you see her

now sort of waving this pie pan fry pan

thing around and saying dark

incantations which are like and she's

hits it on the ground

nailed it yeah I'm just gonna I'll kind

of crouched and stay hidden in the

bushes I just kind of observe strict

enjoy would you like to try to change it

into something else yes I would like to

change it into a fishing pole okay

it occurs to you you knew you should

have written these things down before

you I'm I'm thinking about write down

make another Araucana check that's

sixteen all right you see the pan in her

hand turn into a fishing pole so he

whacks it around as she does that like

the hook gets caught in her hat in

summation here her hat around this is

really sad there's like Turner is

falling over

EF is actually trying to hold back

giggles look I'm sure she's trying very

very hard but yeah but the whole thing

is very charming so this is yank the hat

off and it's attached to the staff or

the the fishing pole and try and turn it

into the broom again all right make

another check well that one's really

that one's 26 right mm-hmm

it turns into a black broom yay mm

floating could apply you sort of hold it

and yeah it just sort of Bob's I kicked

the like the dirty like old broom away

and I'm like that's what you get and

yeah as you've watched me I've seen her

turning different things you can see

kind of itched into each of the forms

she's changed it into is one of the

seven ruins that was that is on her

staff that's someone in the bushes

saying oh I get it I want I know magic

she'll try and turn it into oh there's a

lantern next okay just make another

Akane check that 14 all right

turns into a lantern it has a green

little green fire inside it's like

lighting up the whole area green like

super bright like all right there's a

bright green light illuminating Strix

and the area around her yeah she's

looking around for the person who said

being a baker you can make a stealth

check the other really ok you can

announce yourself either no wall I'm

hiding okay I mean do you interrupt uh

26 all right strikes make your

perception check can you even roll that

hi I got a 20

ok yeah you don't see anything just look

around the lantern like continued real

suspicious volunteer did someone say

continue ok the next I want to turn it

into is it cauldron alright go ahead

that's 12 you succeed yeah so it's

pretty big cauldron to like big enough

to like hopefully put Simon in I don't

know all right so this cauldron does its

own home to the ground cool alright that

worked I'm gonna kick it a little make

sure it's solid oh yeah okay good it's

solid awesome alright next I'm going to

turn it into a coil with green ink

that's like magic ink oh that's that's

plenty that's like 21

sorry what's the incan it's like it's a

quill like green ink yeah like a quill

patent alright so yes the DF you see the

cauldron disappear into a little feather

quilt hmm and she starts writing in the

air and it's like you see a little green

bloom in the air all reading alright

yeah when it says like she goes to write

like but hander but she stops and just

erases it I'm like like she's a little

scared of writing that anymore so she's

just like puts it away right the last

thing she's gonna do is try and her best

and most precious thing that she's tried

to turn

this this staff into and that's a cuddly

owl bear doll that's uh h-hold on oh

wait no 17 yeah you succeed

yay so it's just a facsimile of waffles

but just like a little like really cute

and it's got like button eyes and it's

like really fuzzy and there's like a

patch on it like kind of sewn in so it's

like even kind of crapoly made you from

magic it's not a great dog it's not

great but it's just really soft and she

just like hugs it she's like yay having

turned it into all these different

things you don't think you need to make

the Arkana checks anymore oh good so

she'll just show this go to walk back to

the waffle hut with the owl bear doll

assuming that no one saw her and that no

one was watching her she didn't hear

anything apparently yeah what it looks

like she had finished up I'm gonna slink

away and get back before that okay and

then I'll work turned back get back

inside the hut and then just pretend to

be asleep okay strike scene come back it

doesn't look like you disturbed anybody

with your jungle antics all right that's

good and there's no threats and nope all

right isn't Maya what must be my watch

then now I think deaath went to sleep

because it was his watch that's great

all right so we'll just sit there and

just like as I'm sitting outside just

keep turning it into things and be like

we do there's like little bursts of sort

of green luminescence every time you

change it into something so eventually

like palton you wake up with these

little flashes of green light I I wake

up for a second and seems like no no no

I just go back to sleep

your hand is sort of crawling around and

next to you when you wake up and just

finds another quiet kind of place to

purchase on top of you gated mummified

hand everything

robot child sure sure we do yeah all

kinds of things for quality yeah

all right Strix will probably realize

that she's causing all this light to

appear at some point and then just like

stop because she hears like rustling

inside it's like uh whoops all right

morning comes everybody is awake or

otherwise alert and the waffle hut comes

down and you pack up your things and you

make your way toward Omo which paltin

knows where he's going he just

instinctively knows that away Oh awesome

yeah let's go that way yep my map to see

how far away it is so from or illunga

you guys got a long haul dudu you're

basically heading south through the

jungle let's see you're gonna cross the

river tothe again then you're gonna

skirt around some mountains and you're

going to go about another six days

so everybody's hip points are gonna drop

by - Jesus this whole time it's gotten

real Annoying yes except yours like I

can turn my staff into things yep so

everybody knows what's tricks can turn

her staff into all of those different

things at one point you guys are chased

through the jungle by a pair of undead

gorillas I know that you can see they

each have four arms cool so when they

first come out at you their horror of

horrifying Lee just terrifyingly ugly

and gross and Rotti and

they're white fur is all sort of shorn

off and slopping off and you can see

their bones underneath but you dispatch

them readily you also run into more

undead creatures as you make your way

deeper into the jungle and it becomes

more of a regular thing for example has

just gotten increasingly dangerous but

paltin every once in a while

you see more of those little tiny nature

spirits the spindly spindly black

creatures with the white masks and he's

the only one that sees them yep exactly

yeah guys they're totally there yeah I

promise yep they occasionally pop out of

flowers or out of leaves or out of a

stone and they wave at palton and when

you sleep at night

Paul can you wake up in the morning you

can see you know a couple things in your

possession like fairly minuscule things

like a copper piece or whatever have

been turned into nuts like things nuts

that you can eat or I like these guys

it's just so sweet it is you think it's

imagination that way yeah little

biscotti cookies that you get on Delta

Airlines I'm upset I'm probably eating

some like gross like mushroom off the

ground then like probably is disgusting

and Paulson's got cookies yes yes it's

all imaginary so I mean like imaginary

cookies I don't get to eat anything

no yeah and everyone goes quiet yeah and

as you're making your way through the

jungle across very uneven terrain you

come upon a part that you never thought

you would see here and the first thing

you notice is it gets very very very

cold

um which is I don't notice that you

don't notice that yes but as you realize

that the temperature is dropping rapidly

and it's the middle of the day so this

is bizarre it's otherwise been a very

humid hot trip for you but yes the

temperature begins to drop measurably

until you start to see what appears to

be frost growing on the ferns and on the

trees themselves around you like you are

entering some sort of winter scape left

storm case Thunder yeah can i Arcana

check this

you sure can I'm the only one

appropriately dressed that's eleven you

don't know exactly what to make of it

other than you're convinced it is some

sort of magical weirdness happening in

this local area you're not you're sort

of can your visibility is somewhat

limited because of the density of the

jungle around you as dragon bait is

hacking a path through and kind of

helping palton chart a course toward mo

yeah you start to see more of these

frost lined plants and the ground starts

to kind of crunch underfoot because it's

kind of frozen solid the trees around

you turn white and you can see that

there are icicles growing all over

everything and by the time after about

like sixty feet or so it's become so

cold that you would think that it is

like minus twenty thirty degrees are we

okay

I mean you're you're you know like yeah

yeah that's chilly I'd like everybody to

make perception checks oh I feel bad for

dragon bait

yeah dragon base not too happy about

this Oh nineteen the forest is my

element yes this is my home now fam I

like it I got a 17 27 oh yeah

fine girls finding your dice just a sec

do you need like a super D 20s that's

large enough for you yeah

giant can I can I just say I believe

that the number of times that I have

rolled six on perception is like 95% it

is nuts

alright so DF yes and paltin actually

you're both perceptive enough to notice

as you make your way into the jungle the

some bits of ice kind of fall from the

trees above and it sort of draws your

eyes upward and up in the foliage you

can see what appears to be the aft

section of a ship that is encased in ice

oh cool you see that too right and it's

lodged in the trees like it fell into

them like I think so I'm also seeing

forest creatures and they're bringing me

cookies so I'm not really sure what's

right there's not a ship Oh got a

hole and as you look up even farther

palton doesn't see this at first but DF

you certainly do is there's more of the

ship it appears that there are three

sections of the ship it basically broke

into three pieces and you can see the

aft section the middle section and the

four section DF the aft section the one

that you first saw is closest to you and

it's about 50 feet overhead then the

middle section appears to be higher

still and the bow of the ship even

higher still oh and all three sections

are encased in ice and all the trees

around it are frozen there's a lot of

implications here you can open that

there's even though it's sort of covered

in ice as well that this ship must have

had some sort of balloon

like thing from which it hung and that

is also kind of draped amid the trees

and all torn up like it was some sort of

flying blimp galleon and a cursory

glance is there any part of this ship

Ernie's section that looks familiar to

me you've never seen this ship before

but as you gaze up and study it more

carefully the AFT ship is canted down so

you can kind of see through the ice and

foliage part of its name but the only

letters you can make out are a are space

G oh of course

Argo Argo

I think Argo is check out this ship how

harsh are the elements right now other

than it being like blisteringly cold

like Midwest in you know January early

February okay I know that feeling

yeah and you're a little underdressed

for this weather but yeah other than the

discomfort

you're not like taking damage or

anything okay but it doesn't seem like

it's not like blistering winds or

anything there's no way like immediately

skiers know okay it's just cold hmm well

yeah occasionally you know there's like

a creek that you hear from the sound of

the ship shifting slightly in the boughs

of these great trees and little bits of

ice will break off the trees and the

ship and fall but that's purely gravity

as far as you can tell search is still

showing off her staff like that's a

broom

now it's an elevator Wow Wow look you

don't you do notice that obviously

there's frost on the ground and joints

are getting a little sticky a little bit

yeah yeah

Alton do you know and see more than the

rest of us what what can you make out

about the ship it's big to some big ship

and I I think this ship was meant for us

because all of our initials are there

except for D and P yeah so like I'm sure

there's like some kind of math and it

lines out too we should figure out how

to like take this I don't know I want to

like I'm compelled to look through

this because I've got I got thoughts

going on through my mind

I'm too fearful to speak out loud but

only want to confirm for myself so death

will suggest that we should check the

ship for just just it'll be neat let's

look at the ship guys won't that be fun

cool let's do I can use my new broom and

strikes all media will be like me yes

alright so she turns her staff into a

broom and shoots up into the air I'll

mandolin fly up me too oh wait hold on

can I like can I open it dimension door

and just kind of kick do you through it

yeah totally came you can create a

dimension door and have it open up

somewhere like on the aft end of the

ship but they'd still fly up separately

so you picked the F through the

dimension door before casting your fly

spell from your mandolin by which time

Strix is taken to the air on her broom

and evil ones about to uncoil her rope

when she realizes palton already solved

the DF conundrum thank you Paul alright

Strix as you make your way up on your

broom there's like just a split second

where the magic of the broom cuts out

you just kind of drop about a foot

before it kicks before it kicks back in

again

like a marble it's like a marble and

like a can noise it's like a backfire

yeah

it just slowly putts its way up there

and actually there's like there is smoke

that sort of comes out the back end of

the broom isn't just a sort of a

belching cloud or smoke does that I see

it's like on fire and smoke I'm like

that's a cool feature sure feature

alright yeah so DF the dimension door

throws you out onto the after deck of

the ship which is just ice and delays

I'd like you to make a dexterity saving

throw to find purchase oh wait no

exterior Steven zero I can do that yeah

you can totally do that

well BAM sixteen okay yeah you have no

trouble you grab hold of there's a lot

of the hold on to here based on your

assessment as you appear on the top deck

you notice a couple things right off the

bat the ship the ice covers the top deck

as well it covers all of the rigging

there's no indication that is melting or

otherwise in danger of melting anytime

soon it doesn't look like the cold of

the jungle has any effect here you'll

also see what appears to be a person

frozen on the deck standing up face its

tangled up in the rigging that sort of

hanging upside down and just kind of

swinging just very lightly but frozen

solid well okay so from like where I've

kind of got myself kind of grasped I'm

just gonna push off it so I like ice

skate kind of towards that just slide

right on up and I kind of catch myself

to where that person is okay to try to

get a closer look and see if I can't

find their face or just make a make a

dexterity acrobatics check to slide down

the deck and grab hold of them as you go

back yeah

I'm even better at that 24 okay yeah you

grab hold of this human there's yeah

exactly

and you can see that this human is

dressed like a wizard and

is clearly just killed by the the ice

and the snow and as you grab hold you're

now very close to the edge where this

part of the ship broke off from the

midsection see about 15 feet above you I

don't up away from you I'd say about 30

feet is the midsection of the ship with

its mast kind of thrusting up at a weird

angle and you can see into the lower

decks and sort of the cargo area of that

ship and you can see a bunch of frozen

nets and rigging and other things okay

so the insides are all iced over as well

yes all right when does that thing where

like if your toddler is like walking on

a Ledge and they're kind of teetering

she's like she doesn't touch him or

anything but she covers and on the in

the air like right next to him just kind

of like okay like mom arming like you

know is like a mom is like ready to

catch but not stopping the kid I mean

whatever they're doing she's doing okay

palton yours up and around in your

mandolin are you going to try to land on

deck or just stay on the instrument for

the time being

uh I'll hover about walking on that

seems tedious I see this this wizard

fellow

yeah you see this dead figure that the

DF is hanging on to hanging upside down

from the rigging and he's pretty tangled

up good and I like give a little tap on

them okay it's like guys is he okay from

your vent from your vantage point you

can see that there are other corpses

inside the broken off sections of the

ship it looks like a lot of the crew

just perished instantly because of the

the ice something real bad happened here

yeah now I don't really I don't I don't

know they arcane that well but can I can

I do I have an idea that the ice that's

all on the ship driving feel like it

something else that caused it or is the

jungles itself that froze over the ship

do they make an intelligence

investigation check okay I got that

oh honey that's good you don't think

that this is something that the jungle

created you think there was some sort of

magical catastrophe like perhaps some

kind of magical artifact that had the

power to something to create ice or

freeze things over be catastrophic

if in the wrong hands yeah have you ever

heard of something like that before I'd

like everybody to make perception checks

so when it's a natural 22 I still bother

adding it on or because that's a 30

that's wow 16 okay well you're all

pretty perceptive oh but it goes without

saying that waffles and Simon and Dragon

Vader's still now 50 feet below you

they're sort of not directly under the

ship but they're kind of down there just

kind of looking up at you guys

waffles waffles just she's totally

comfortable with her a thick fur and

both the cold doesn't seem to faze her

at all which is there to sort of tapping

her feet anxiously on the ground and at

one point she sort of rears up like she

thinks she might be able to go but none

of that distraction is enough for you

not to see or rather hear what sounds

like something hitting the deck on the

middle section of the ship a little bit

higher up than you it's like something

just landed with a loud crunch on that

deck and as you turn in that direction

you see coming up over the edge of the

deck and glaring down at you a

saber-toothed tiger made entirely of ice

[Laughter]

roll initiative ii it shows of them like

my mind matters palton everything

prepare for or for for evil in 1212 for

Strix yeah 1717 okay as the tiger

ghal hours at you it's icy fangs

glittering in what little sunlight

filters down through the trees there is

a loud sound and exploding all around

you and going outward forming a gigantic

sphere around the entire ship is a blast

of cold energy and I'd like you all to

make constitution saving throws oh no

what ever will I do with a constitution

savings groan look you know what evil in

[Laughter]

1919-20

yeah six alright this burst of cold for

those who can fly it just looks like it

almost looks like the opposite of a

fireball like a cold ball there's like a

little bead of cold that just explodes

outward in a sphere that encompasses the

entire ship all of you and even hits the

ground also but catching it also catches

dragon bait waffles and silent and the

blast my son all right

evylyn and DF you take the full brunt of

the cold and you each take 35 cold

damage I thought I was impervious to

cold no

[Music]

yes okay

Paul to Halton and Strix you take half

of that which is 17 points of cold

damage Simon takes half of that leaving

him sort of still intact but badly

frozen you know never occurred to me

that Simon can die waffles takes all of

that leaving her badly blistered by cold

and dragon bait takes all of that

no don't want the tiger does not seem to

be affected in released does it seemed

come from the tiger I assumed it came

from the tiger you're not sure it went

up it sort of went off between you and

the tiger more or less and next up is DF

so di you're hit by this absolutely

blistering cold what do you do

how close am I to this Tiger you are

thirty feet away and it's a gap with a

50-foot plunge between you in it

okay well I'm pretty sure thirty feet is

just outside a fireball range and I want

to be further away from that but still

close enough that I get some of the

worms oh yeah so it's clear like this

saber-toothed tiger is a he's not like

he's they're like white fur anything

like he's literally Isis like he was he

has made of animated ice like he was

created by something can control the

winters and be very dangerous in the

wrong hands

like something we should have all right

boy

I am very cold to the point where I

could hardly function and I need to get

away from whatever this nonsense is yes

I'm just gonna throw a dagger at him

okay you hurl a dagger at the ice tiger

make this ice yes it's really sad

because my muscles and bones are all oh

natural twenties all right that dudes

dagger hit all right it happened so real

here die twice for damage all right

first one is a one set the one is a one

so seven okay but yes you hit it dead on

a chip of your ice breaks off it's a

body it doesn't try to react so then

just as the same way that I slid to this

location yeah I'm gonna do the the same

thing back just push off and slide and I

skate

give me twirl a little bit just kind of

get further away okay further away on

the after make a thanks there any

acrobatics check me it's 13 and

afterwards but still a 1 ok

you push yourself back but you don't

find anything really to grab onto and

you just sort of go right over the back

of the ship what can I eat him since I

was there like waiting to I was mom

arming already uh you would you couldn't

stop him from attempting what he's doing

but you don't know that he's gonna fail

yet well if he fell over that I I

thought he was falling over the end of

the show yeah but he would have been at

that point he'll be like 30 feet away

from you oh yeah yeah

Can I grab on to it

sure can you can make a sign rank saving

throw yeah as I realize I'm like oh wait

wait wait try to reach back for it yeah

you sort of grab part of the railing and

it just sort of breaks off it's cuz it's

so brittle Oh cut time the war's 18 but

you manage to sort of grab on to some

vines and things hanging down from the

tree and as you do you peel back a

little bit more of the name now that

you're dangling and banging up against

the back of the ship you can see it's

not Arg oh it's star space GE oh oh

so as I'm hanging there sky like that

you're totally flying you grab on to

something secure fine you know alright

the next thing that happens is the tiger

leaps forth and since evil and you're

the one closest to it is going to leap

across the gap between the midsection of

the ship in the aft section of the ship

and try to pounce on you bro all right

23 that is okay I need you to make a DC

14 strength saving throw for me so

strength Sammy bro 14 yeah I rolled I

got 14 okay so you're fine which means

it bounces but does not does not knock

you prone I do like the dig in my toes

like yeah and now it is on it is sort of

knocked you back a little ways and is

now just on the edge of the aft section

of the ship and it's big like it's about

10 11 feet long and just me I think we

probably look really cool locked in

single combat yeah and you can see the

ship sort of shifts a little bit so that

it kind of skids about three feet to one

side when it lands is so here's the ship

it pounced on me it put is it pushing me

toward the edge you're not in any danger

of falling because you're flying well I

know that but is it pushing me toward

the edge as its momentum going to is

pushing you toward the back of the ship

I'm sure I was gonna try to

use a reaction to let its momentum carry

it off the ship but I can't do that it

sounds like no and it would be too far

for it to go yeah the aft section of the

ship is about 30 feet long

okay okay but it is now on the aft

section a little bit below you evylyn

because you're flying and then it's done

and we come to Strix please oh man I

just saw this stuff happen I'm like I

the tiger is not my concern

there is a magic person here and I want

to know where they are you can make a

perception check to try to follow I want

to know where they are so I'm like

looking around that's that's a hopes

nope that's a 7 I don't know where they

are you know in that case it's just time

for fire so I'm just gonna go and I

guess where I saw like the fire the ice

fire erupted I'm the erupted between the

aft section and the middle section of

the ships okay if I see the tiger is on

evil and I know that she can probably

handle that for the second so I'm just

gonna I'm gonna focus to where I saw

that happen and so you detonated in

roughly the same area that will actually

get the tiger in its blastic you okay

perfect yes I'm gonna detonate in that

same area but I'm also gonna do it at

5th level all right so that's I think 10

do you 6 yeah yeah all right I already

got the dice roll already 32 all right

and I just have to check something see

if this thing is a vulnerable to fire

Weston yes it is vulnerable to fire all

right so 32 you said yes and I'll of

course protect everyone aside I'm

definitely just trying to carve a swath

wherever this magic person is yes when

your fireball goes off the the blast

from it causes the mid section of the

ship to tilt and fall out of its tree

and you can see it tears a bunch of

frozen branches and vines with it it

makes this absolutely cacophonous sound

as it crashes down and splinters on the

ground

and it lands about 30 feet away from

Simon and waffles I think I'd hope the

magic person was in there but it is

absolutely loud it just sort of crunches

down and kind of collapses in on itself

when it falls so now there is a really

big gap between the aft and four

sections of the ship with no middle

section between them and the tiger is

badly badly melted by this fireball but

is still intact it's lost some of its

finer features but it's still so alive

and it is more fire I'm working on it

paltin that wasn't directed to you so do

i I'm not sure if I can but could I

possibly try to dispel magic on this

thing on the tiger yeah absolutely try

cool can I try to do that at a fifth

level spell so when he cast the spell

using a spell slot a fourth level or

higher you automatically end the effects

of a spell on the target if the spells

level is equal to or less than that

which you used please five or lower

piece okay you target the ice tiger with

the spell and nothing happens

yay is my actual reaction evylyn yeah

yeah there's a half melted ice tiger in

front of you and you can't the spell

magic on it thanks very much

tom says it goes whoosh pass like a

mandolin and just to be sure that I

didn't miss this we still have no idea

where the potential magic magic user who

might be casting all this course you

haven't seen hide nor hair of that

person thing individual and what search

your heart

I was wondering if maybe I could do some

sort of like perception check but that

would probably take my action you could

it would take your action or hear me out

you have and I'm not very perceptive

yeah i okay I well I don't want that

cold blast thing to go off again that

almost wiped us out is anyone do any of

my party members look like they're in

imminent danger of you saw death go for

the back of the ship and disappear from

your view and it looked like he took a

hell of a blast from that cold

yes he's long gone okay so I think I

think as paltin seems to like be engaged

with this this ice tiger I'm like I

believe so much in you and then I turn

around and leave okay and go get dere

yeah you say what do you go when you fly

around in your little winged boots you

see DF hanging from a frozen buying off

the boy my vine is on a full rotation

just give him like a little boost like I

know I can't lift him with my boots but

I want at least like push him towards

where you're like game purchase and

climb up oh I'm like I'm my head I'm

like clear and I like pushing with that

into the into the ship and I give him I

don't know like you'd probably need a

ton like 20 hit points I lost 35 just

yeah yeah you need that all your voice

too damn close

I'm sorry giving him 20 who's that yeah

okay yeah you can push him up on to the

back of the ship if you want okay it's

gonna add it to you right there all

right very good at the end of Evelyn's

turn another magical effect goes off a

giant hand made of ice appears over

evylyn and attempts to grab hold of her

over evylyn yep oh this person knows way

too much magic

look out thanks Dave to do yeah the hand

itself has like a span of about 12 feet

it's monstrously huge and it's just

floating there magically and it's all

made of ice and to do

evylyn this is basically a grapple so I

need you to make a strength athletics

check in the hand has advantage on it

[Laughter]

okay high rolled a six okay my

significant strength yes this big ice

hand basically just wraps around

evylyn and clenches around her tightly

and she is held completely within its

grasp and then it begins to crush her

and evylyn you take that's right you

take 13 bludgeoning damage as you are

crushed by this grasping hand of ice and

it continues to hold on to you and float

there right above you Dee at this huge

ice hand all right and DF you're next

you you can see the ice tiger making its

way up the deck toward you it's ice

claws digging into the deck and evylyn

trapped inside an ice hand behind me

correct okay I'm actually not super

concerned about evylyn don't worry about

me I'm fine I you tiger however

to be trouble big trouble yeah so it's a

nearby paltin and evil in our ear paltin

and streaks or kinda like floating

nearby yeah they're sort of circling

around on their instruments okay oh geez

it's hard to do anything on this ice

it's elated right now the tiger right

for my car is actually a little bit

lower than you so it looks like it's

getting ready to pounce on you yeah I am

actually just going to pull out the

sword and try it and wait for him to

come to me so for my action I'm actually

going to take take the defense action or

dodge action or whatever it is an

opportunity yeah okay all right then

immediately after that you see the tiger

crouched down it's ice tail swish a

little bit and then launches itself

toward you I'm ready for it

alright I rolled a 20 total what's your

secure our class is normally 17 what is

that oh so yeah it's I think it's gonna

miss you because your AC goes up I think

my 5 ok looking up or is it or is it

disadvantaged in fish might be I'm just

checking double checking okay dodge has

this advantage okay great

it misses you well yeah so thanks to

that maneuver it does not pounce on you

and take you down to the deck so as it

leaps over me I actually like knock it

down the ground and like slide across

the ice underneath it

nice alright yeah it lands with empty

jaws and empty Clause and then like

breakdance we go way back up on my feet

behind it okay I look awesome

yep Strix you see DF performing this

deft move you also see the ice hand or

even used to be through through it's

sort of translucent form you can see

gold and evil

stuck inside its icy grasp she's like

giving a thumbs up and like I am still

looking for this magic person I missed

him last time because now I will let you

make a procession check with advantage

since you're actually trying to pay

attention to where he is

I am so trying to pay attention to where

this person is yep you can you can see

him currently I'm on to you magic person

yeah you can see that the figure is on

the forward deck of the ship on the

bowsprit with a sort of good above view

of all of you because you're on a lower

deck then he is it is artists Cimber the

thing you notice most about him is that

his eyes are glowing blue no it's most

about him is that he wasn't strong

enough

oh yeah his eyes are glowing blue yep

peace yelling uh alright well looks

like I'm gonna have to figure out a way

to trick him and/or fix this so you try

polymorph him good idea how close to

have to be to do that well let me check

oh I have a car 60 feet great alright

and he's got to make a wisdom saving

throw correct yes all right what are you

trying to polymorph him into oh I think

this time we will go with a tiny baby

chick okay it's tiny little like a white

one a little pot like a snowball turn

him into an ice cube

was pretty good okay roll the 19 on the

die which is higher once you apply his

wisdom bonus so you see your magical

lights Flair around him trying to force

him into this new form but he shuts it

off well as that doing it I'm going over

there oh just point a at least a pulse

and who's the only one is not evens

hands are like this and she's like oh

okay mostly I'm gesturing like crown

madness and he sees you again once he

realizes he has fought off your effect

you see him smile at you malevolently

and he says ice to see you again Strix

[Laughter]

and then he sort of hold he's got his

he's got the ring on one hand and it

just sort of glows with the same blue

light that fills his eyes and you can

see snowflakes begin to coalesce around

his hand all right

and you traitor and then next up is

palton so I see I see Strix and him 60

feet away from each other

glaring at one another you guys call him

like farness you piece of what are

you doing I'm gonna let me see something

here how far are they ish they're about

90 feet away from you that's I'm sorry

that's not correct Strix is 30 feet away

from you artists is 90 feet away from

you okay

so question about the terrain is there

like is there anything like directly

above him if we're on a shift is he

under some kind of master maybe there's

like yeah you can see that they're

certainly kind of broken off boughs of

the tree and things where the ship came

crashing down but directly above his

head okay you can see what looks to be

tattered pieces of the blimp that have

wrapped around tree trunks and kind of

forming like a torn tattered canopy over

his head that's not very heavy well in

total it probably is but yeah it I mean

this it's like a half of the remains of

a blimp hmm no that's not gonna work

it's facts cold puns are on point right

now my god I'm gonna the other thing you

noticed too is that this ship like the

other section of the ship is sort of

crashed into the bowels of the tree and

he's just sort of precariously

positioned on what appears to be a

frozen tree bow okay and they're they're

like on the the other the other part

they're on the front piece of the ship

Europa okay go over the back piece of

the ship okay so I would have to magic

by way over there I'm gonna dimension

door over there just so I can be there

all right so you're using another fourth

little spots a lot to do that right

mm-hmm

okay you appear now do you want to be on

the deck itself that would put you about

like ten feet away from artists

closer uh no on the deck it's fine all

right so when you appear artist

attention shifts to you as you step

through the doorway like hey buddy uh

hmm no he said he said ice to seat

I had something for this I'm gonna take

that all right good to see you cold

friend all right he will smile and he

says the ring is mine he will never have

it do you think all right

yes he seems much more threatened by you

than Strix because you have previously

sought to the ring sought to take it

from him so he turns his attention

toward you but it is evil ins turn

evylyn you are in the crushing grasp of

this giant ice and yeah

whilst whilst in here you can't go

anywhere well well your grappled until

you break the grapple or slip out of it

and you can either use your you can use

an action to try to break out with a

strength athletics check or slip out

with the dexterity acrobatics or you can

just stay in the hand do you question

yeah to ignite the hardest Vannelli mmm

do I need to have it in grasp yeah I'd

say you have to be holding on to it but

you can

you've all grappled you can still like

reach for stuff okay so even squirms

squirms are hands down grabs the hardest

Valley yep and just tries to go

all right yes you liked the fire of the

blade now I will let you use the blade

just to deal fire damage to the hand if

you like yeah that's the plan alright

yeah roll are all the fire damage for

the sword because you're not actually

swinging it you're just just the fire

damage yeah you're just banging the

damage against it see good rules real

fine from there guys hold on okay I'm

gonna say that the hand has

vulnerability to fire so it's gonna take

double fire death okay so I I do five

points of fire damage and it's also

supposed to ignite it I don't know if I

can ignite no a nice hand okay you can't

just not I can ignite the ice hand but

you are doing double damage to it so you

said you did five I ruled five so ten

okay it takes that damage it is still

intact but you have no I imagine it

looks like holding the store and she's

like ah yeah yeah yeah steam is starting

to pour out through the gaps in the hand

absolutely alright um uh let's see as a

bonus action on his turn artists will

have the hand crush you again you take

ten points of bludgeoning damage maybe

ten points right yeah all right and then

artists will turn his wrath on you

paltin and blast you in the face with a

cone of cold no I need you to make a

constitution saving through

that would be in at 20 all right you're

gonna take we're gonna take half damage

from this blast of cold anyone he's not

within 10 feet of me right nobody's

without feet again all right so instead

of taking 43 points of damage you take

21 points of cold damage paltin so I'm

doing this I'm just like hey wait still

enough all right yeah actually more than

that he is frozen solid Oh in that the

cold goes overhead wanted to go and he's

just absolutely encased in ice in that

pose Oh what about my thing I'm sorry

there might might my new skin thing okay

so the good news is is that with the

blessing of wound closure you do not

have to make death saves all right yeah

okay and that's the harnesses turn the

next turn goes to death so you saw this

blast of cold erupt on the other section

of the ship about a good 60 feet

actually farther than that 90 feet away

from UDF yeah just to know that I can

tell there's something up there yeah I

saw I saw Palmer's tricks go that way

yeah and then you see the tiger turning

around to try to you know tear into you

again I have no way of getting up to the

fore of the ship like that do I

you would have been able to dilip on to

the midsection and then off that onto

the

you have the front section but that fell

on yeah yeah Strix took that out so I'm

stuck with this Tiger yeah now I will

say there are clinging bits of the blimp

overhead some of you stretched pretty

tightly in fact there's one section of

the blimp that's still clinging onto the

aft section it's wrapped around a tree

very taut Lee which is wrapped around

another tree branch which is rath

another around a tree branch but

eventually sort of ends above where

paltin is it could be that the tension

on that if you were to suddenly release

it might slingshot you it's a terrible

idea

[Laughter]

no I think I'm just kind of I think it's

kind of forced to be engaged with this

Tiger yeah you turn on the time is there

a easy way for me to descend off of this

part of the ship and get back town

towards waffles and dragon bait there

are hanging bits of things that you can

essentially grab on to to try to lower

your descent and not take damage from

the fall I'll say it will require an

acrobatic strike okay

I mean if I can get down to there and

forth the type of conscious after me you

mean make possibly make a potentially

dangerous jump at least have dragon bait

waffles there's back up that the drip

okay yeah so low engagement is not the

it's thing ever so I'm yeah I'm gonna

try to a bunch of by and soon descend

down and try to get to them as quickly

as possible

yeah go ahead and make your dexterity

acrobatics that goes here all right

plunge which die don't trust not that

one let's try this I tripped I Oh pretty

good 28 okay yeah you're able to

basically scuttle your way down all the

way just by leaping onto bits and pieces

of things that sort of tear away as you

grab onto them but you land safely like

a cat

great and then like I'll sprint over to

drag a baton waffles and then kinda

betray my attention back towards where

the the tiger was yeah that way like

without even saying anything they should

know something's coming they'll be ready

for it all right

yeah it's now fifty feet above you yeah

and it's its turn so it comes to the

edge of the the ship and looked down at

you half-melted

such as it is yeah yeah and then it's

going to leap down upon you all the way

up there yep it misses this big ice hat

comes crashing down onto you what's your

a c-17 alright you step out of the way

and it just smashes into the ground and

breaks apart into pieces and is

destroyed whoa okay

that's the Tigers turn tricks you hear

the Kratt you see the tiger hurl itself

down at death and then crash into the

ground having missed him know exactly

what happened there just sounded like

someone broke of AWS yep

yeah Paulson's frozen with his fingers

in the air so artis is I'm his next

target I'm very concerned about that I

really just want to fireball him but I

don't think that's a very good idea so

do I think that the spell magic would

dispel the Big B's hand me just

double-check yeah you think it could it

isn't magically summoned effect and

believe it could okay if you if you get

high enough you'll have to roll right to

try and dispel it yep um okay I'm

thinking about doing that so that I can

get evil ins help because I don't think

I'm gonna do enough damage to him cuz

he's I can't see that he's even injured

at all right

not touched he's not even touched okay

yeah alright um so yeah I'm going to try

and dispel that hand that it's on either

one okay and the range of dispel magic

is 120 feet so you can do it right from

where you were cool all right yes so you

turn around you cast the spell on her

just make your roll all right that's

just being a tad no it is a it is a

ability check using your spell casting

ability on it okay cool go ahead oh so

okay so so that's 20 all right yes you

just spell the ice hand yes yeah it was

just floating even with a burning

two-handed sword ready she's pissed all

right

I'd also like to try and I don't know

what range I am within him with him

certainly I'm with it's like 60 feet

you're at 60 feet okay dude is there any

like trees I can hide behind or anything

to get cover there is actually the

hanging tatters of the blimp okay you

could easily fly up among those pieces

of ripped canvas and hide behind them

yeah I'm gonna miss you step behind

there it's like all right you disappear

all right and evylyn you see you are

freed likes tricks is magic then she

suddenly misty steps and disappears and

you don't know where she is

no sorry I know anything about Paul

Tain's

frozen condition like do I think that if

I laid on hands and healed him it would

go away or is it more of a magical

condition that I would have to change

you don't really know until you get up

there till I try okay but you can see

he's encased in ice at the moment that's

all you know okay probably not good for

a long time regardless right

[Laughter]

and I see Strix locked in combat with

artists no stress is gone now she's gone

that's right she's been tucked away she

she kind of like gestured towards him at

school like like go at it alright I take

that cue from her cuz evylyn was kind of

like paulsen artists paltin artists and

then saw that Strix was like take care

of artists which evylyn takes to mean of

course Strix will take care of paulten

which I don't know if that's true but

even if it's not and so she goes for

artists with the with the great story

you can get all you could get all the

way to him if you use your move and your

action because you're about a hundred

and twenty feet away okay how far am i

from paulten you're a hundred and twenty

feet away from him I'm equidistant from

them yeah they're basically they're on

the same deck together very close to one

another

oh they are yeah okay well yeah I just

try to get over there then either way

all right I'm going I'm going that

direction either I go full-bore that

puts you pretty darn close or basically

within melee range of both palton

there's like ice fragments like coming

off of me and melting and I'm like got

this sword behind me and I'm flying over

I bet it looks pretty epic there's fire

coming off absolutely yes that's what

Strix was hoping for is like one of

those just like scary evil and like

righteous moments she's like this isn't

my job go when he sees you coming toward

and when you get really close to him

you see artists close up for the first

time he is definitely not himself the

the glowing blue eyes is your first clue

but there's just something about him his

the way he's posed the way he's sneering

at you it's not the guy that you

previously met and when you approach him

a doorway magically appears behind him

and he backs through it disappears and

you've seen that effect before it's a

dimension door spell well father that's

all my action right now that's correct

and the Tigers done and yes you don't

see that because you are now looking at

an angle where you can't see what's yeah

on the deck I've no idea what's going on

I just know that everyone went to the

front of the section of the ship yeah

you would have seen even go right across

the front section of the ship I mean

that alone is comforting mm-hmm

and then you hear say some you know

toned down curse word I don't really

have a good way of getting up to that

part of the ship do I it's about 80 feet

or so up in the trees now I don't know

if I would trust climbing all the frozen

stuff to get up to it

it's tricky disadvantage on your wrong

yeah I I'd rather not I think I may

because actually just stay with waffles

and dragon bait until I can tell it's

going on make a perception check all

right 22 okay

while you're hanging out down there one

of the things you notice is the middle

section of the ship which crashed is

just sort of lying on the ground now

with all these broken tree limbs and

tattered bits of rigging and masks and

I'm sorry blimp canvassed all around it

it's like the rest of the ship encased

in ice and when I landed it was very

brittle and just sort of cracked apart

into pieces and you can see there is old

cargo in there sort of trapped in frozen

Nets but one of the pieces of cargo

catches your eye because it appears to

be some sort of gleaming gold chest oh

all right I'll keep that in mind as I

wait for the others okay and next up is

strix all right I I'm trying I'm

probably like peeking through a little

hole like white I just like my dimension

door you didn't see his dimension door

but you heard evil eye

oh go Oh drat darn poopy as one of our

lovely chat members said

frost thanks to the original stiva cos

prime for that one alright okay so just

rolls our eyes first and foremost and

then I guess just like Peaks around like

flies I'm just gonna peek around see if

I can see any sign of artists make a

perception jo6 yeah no you don't see him

there's so much overgrowth and stuff

it's hard to see anything all right if

that's the case then I will I'll try and

um

welp Alton's frozen so I figured he

blends by palton he'll be fine

so I'll just try and zoom back down to

find where waffles and able to regroup

with all of them you can see that they

were all to some extent caught in the

initial blast of cold that artists

discharged waffles was and the Simon

were both taken below half their hit

points dragon bait just shook it off

pretty much all right um I already did

all my I would heal someone but I argued

my stuff so I'm just gonna show with

them alright you see Simon's sort of

nudge himself up in front of the waiting

line of your character shade I believe

you well I think the because I could

make them so I think I had a couple left

over remember I think I could just make

them I don't think I actually had them

I'm gonna say I don't have them what I'm

saying I can make them so but if I can

heal yes if Simon walks up to me I'll

just roll my eyes and like alright I

guess this is something we've done

before and just give them some hit

points okay uh I don't want to cause a

rift in the party I don't care about

certain people's son so you're this

handing him a potion no I'm here do you

think you're what yeah go ahead yeah

when is it again I'm so bad at

remembering 24 plus 2 that's right

I never made those that might be the

potion of him stealing tickets on one

day yeah 28 28 plus your oh that's right

that's right okay plus my so it's like

seven here's a seven hitpoints there you

go buddy all right

ungrateful robot yeah you might be

grateful you don't know I don't think he

is he walks away from you after that

yeah all right and that's strict

Susteren so now palton was frozen

evylyn so she made this like - for this

guy he went through the door and but

then she turns to pulp and then she just

melts just like full-on flies over to me

and wraps her arms and legs around him

in this big hug okay and she's like

trying to warm him up but she's also

laying on hands like wrap your hands and

like legs wrapped around and - and

everything there's like little monkey on

it yeah you you totally money em and as

you do the warm glow of lavender washes

over him

and the ice melts away how much healing

are you doling out imma give him twenty

- twenty - twenty as well you have 20

hit points Bolton yeah thank you

now I have an idea she doesn't like oh

by the way right okay anyway it worked

we're good idea yeah you hear some

jubilation up on high from paltin and

evylyn all right well good no they're

okay and Strix is with me at this point

yes I'm reluctantly healing Simon okay

I'll ask her what the hell happened up

there

that was art artists artists Cimber he's

possessed by the ring of winter and he's

probably still around because she can't

find him

he's what I'm not got me like scan the

entire forest to see if I can see him at

all cuz I just like would make the

reception Jack oh boy no that's not very

good

13 you don't okay I don't see him apart

from me just fire balling this entire

area which I am not opposed to I think

it best if we just grew up I have an

idea we can't hear you again why it's

once it's my chart you can talk by the

way out of turn that's okay all right

but actually if we want to count turns I

guess D are you doing anything I kind of

want to so the middle section I kind of

crashed down is there enough there that

we can kind of get inside - yeah there's

enough practice from the outside yeah

unless somebody's standing at like

either end and looking in you have

pretty much a shell of protection okay I

want to bring everyone into that so at

least have some kind of cover from the

outside elements or protential more ice

balls or whatever okay and also pointing

out that there's this treasure chest and

I'm going to deal with it a little bit

as you bring waffles and Simon and

dragon bait into this frozen shell of a

ship you can see that there are two

corpses also trapped in this hold that

were killed by ice one of them the way

it's dressed suggests that she might

have been some sort of high-ranking

officer or captain aboard the ship but

she's frozen one of her arms is

outstretched and holding in it what

appears to be a frozen key it's locked

in her frozen death grip I don't need

that keys are for clubs yeah and then

the other one looks like a deckhand

who is just sort of lying frozen amid

some broken barrels and crates yeah okay

okay so that's your turn

Strix you're now inside this mid section

of the ship surrounded by all this

frozen cargo and this golden chest which

has a it's kind of a tall hexagonal

chest with a sort of pyramidal lid it's

got six sides and it's got a locking

it's got a lock on one side Strix can

you make sure there's nothing magical

about it or magically trapped or

anything it's really exciting all right

this is slaps it are you using a detect

magic spell you're just trying to

ascertain what like Arcana or something

um I think I do have I do I have to take

magic no I don't it's just Arcana I'm

not useful like that I'll let you make a

intelligence Arcana check all right

that's a 22 good job that's exactly what

you needed you see that there is a

magical glyph of warding on the chest

you think it is set to trigger if

somebody opens it with anything other

than the proper key comes this loud

shrieking voice from inside all right

yeah and that's your action so paltin

you're up all right how long has it been

since artists poofed away it hasn't been

too long or technically unconscious at

the time but based on what evylyn told

you it's okay cool I'm gonna use locate

creature on them all right okay is this

one of your mandolin things or is this

or spell just spell okay great

yes so this guy's familiar with you you

sense the direction to its location as

long as

one thousand feet which it is yes so you

cast the spell and then you just use

zero in on him you can see that he is on

a frozen tree branch about thirty feet

above and he's got his long bow out a

point I'm like and he sees that you see

him and then he sort of come brings it

around toward you hold on no she's next

to you you'll have protection from stuff

yeah it's it's still your action you

could move if you wanted to I feel

protected where I am all right you stand

your ground evylyn you're up you're

still holding on to paltin as he's

pointing up into the trees that artists

who's got a bow that's being leveled at

their direction it was like he points it

even goes and he goes be right back and

she had the sword like she was holding

but she had the sword still in one hand

like held a big flaming sword be right

back and she goes all right you can get

there and attack him haha bring the

flaming sort of part of Spinelli down

upon his icy face all right what does

that say that is a 23 you hit him and it

does 4 plus 2 is 6 6 10 okay 10 normal

and then Oh 6 plus 6 12 fire damage

ignites him if he's able to be ignited

okay uh yes let me get another attack

all right so you hit him you set him on

fire

and you get to make another attack dog

fries my friend

attack the tree branch that's a 20 okay

you know I am attacking him he is maybe

very upset he froze paltin with an

obscene gesture on his hands by the way

yeah 20 so hit him again

that means it's five nine normal damage

and eight fire damage so 17 total okay

you lay into him he is badly wounded and

he'll take the fire damage at the start

of his turn so keep that in mind Anna

okay I call out it was like kill him

protector you don't have to wait long

because it is now the start of his turn

so fire fire oh and I need I roll it yes

you do

is it 2d6 again it is sick he takes four

more okay he is not going to spend an

action putting himself out so he is

still on fire don't what a badass oh boy

he's really really close to you what's

he gonna do what can he do the longbow

is probably not good at this range

she'll have disadvantage and all of his

attacks so he is going to cast away the

longbow I wish I could call it shot cut

off the finger that has the ring on it

just that one with a two-handed great

sword alright

fighting it off he is going to pull out

his magic dagger the one with the blue

stone in the at the end of it in the

pommel and he is going to stab at you

from hell's hearts three times geez

but all three stabs you're going to

declare

so you are in melee combat with artists

now I'm a little buzzing beat yeah and

you can still see he's in the grasp of

the ring for sure his eyes are still

glowing blue and next up is DF yeah if

you can see high high above you about 90

feet

evylyn on a tree branch throwing down

with somebody it must be artists can't

be anybody else yeah you see her because

there's this big flaming blade yeah I'll

be looking Reds tricks and tell her to

go help evylyn he was covering the chest

try not to let you do just don't touch

him so listen when it's her turn okay

all right when she leads him I touched

the out of that chest no I'm

actually gonna go over to the frozen

captain and look at her some more cuz he

said she her hand is outstretched

holding the key yes and it looks like it

may be the key to the chest yeah why

look like it's like she's trying to hand

it off to someone maybe perhaps yes and

then why we should be giving it to

someone and then why would she be frozen

like that I think an intelligence

investigation to try to write reason

that okay I would love to do that

nineteen you might surmise that she was

entrusting the key to somebody so that

she could go fight off whatever threat

was imperiling her ship it suggests

maybe she didn't want to be have the key

in her possession maybe she was going to

do something dangerous you don't know

huh it's their way I can just take that

little key without like breaking off a

frostbitten finger I think I got a

really good grip on it and she's frozen

solid oh no I don't think she'll care

but I mean you can you can you know with

your glove hand to sort of pry open her

fingers you hear this sort of crackling

noise yeah can I do that yeah you do

okay sound get the key to stall and you

get the cream all right and then I'll

bring it over to

the chest and look compare markings to

the lock itself the tumblers inside to

the key and its prongs and see how that

matches up it look like this is the

right law it does look like the Reiki in

your estimation with the treasure I'm

gonna just tell dragon bait and waffles

to kind of be back up a little bit they

will back up just dragon bait will start

Chuck waffles behind some cargo yeah

waffles still got a big butt sticking

out one end so yeah yeah I'll take that

key and just very slowly very gently

slide it in and twist it into it clicks

click it does and the lid springs up a

little bit allowing you to lift it off

and when you appear inside you see a

cushioned interior compartment sitting

in which is a device that looks like a

black egg and it's got a sort of healed

shaped window on one side and blue light

coming out of it out through this window

so whatever's inside is glowing blue

inside this egg this black egg has a

little kind of knob at the top of it

with what looks like another key hole in

the top and also see on the backside of

the egg is what looks to be some sort of

clock I don't like any of this bit is

this clock ticking down no okay but you

said there's another keyhole on this yes

does it look like it could be possibly

opened up you make it make a I'm gonna

say make an intelligence investigation

or wisdom perception check to see how

this egg might open all right perception

15 okay you think that this egg has no

it has seams the way it was built and it

looks like it's maybe made out of some

sort of black gold or something it looks

very precious

and and it's about this big around okay

and about that high but you don't think

that it was meant to be opened all of it

seems basically have rivets holding it

in place you think that if you were to

turn a key you would activate it somehow

device do it and I'm just gonna gently

close the lid and just kind of sit there

and think about this for a while while

everyone else takes their turn all right

great

strikes ah yeah I'm here I go yep you

see Evelyn on a big frozen branch

battling it out with artists flaming

sword and little dagger is there any

possible way that I could get my mage

Han to take the ring off of him all

right

oh I tried I was like maybe I can save

it and I'm like man

well is it possible to read a fireball

there without affecting any of the ship

because I don't want it to fall on my

friends yes you can aim high all right

that's what I'm gonna do

fireball okay he's gotta make a good

charity save it like blows past Yvonne's

hair it looks yes well he rolled a three

on the die so he's not going to make

that saving throw alright that's 826

damage oof okay well he is well and

truly hurt by that but still alive badly

badly burned at this point you can see

that the frost and snow on the tree

around him has all kind of melted away

and is now just sort of turned into

running water by the intensity and the

fireball blasts at least we're all

warming up a little bit and he was still

on fire from the sword so he is he is

getting well and truly burnt black is

also yelling evil and cut his hand off

all right and paltin you see the big

fireball engulfed everybody and then

when it dissipates artist is more

charred and burned than he was before

but still alive

cool and how how far they they're about

30 feet away from you and you can also

see that the the tattered bits of blimp

canvas sort of in the tree are also now

kind of on fire and burning away and

kind of falling down in sheets of

raining fire

when strict said that too even by the

way she she wants to yell back like I'm

it's not his fault I'm not gonna kill

him or hurt him I'm just gonna knock him

out and take the ring I mean that works

too but I was just thinking maiming was

just faster sorry could I hmm could I uh

try and take the hand and just like

chuck it up at him go do something

through the air those tumbling end over

end just make a gun make it ranged

attack roll so okay

add your this is an improvised weapon so

roll and add your dexterity bonus okay

that would be a seventeen outstanding

okay so the hand gets thrown up and just

latches onto his face starts to applaud

bigots fingers into his eyeballs and in

his mouth okay he goes off the tree with

this thing hanging onto his face and you

see artist you see artists and the hand

just go like Wiley coyote just actually

based on the positioning he'll fall

through the midsection so DF as you are

inside staring at this egg

contemplative Li there's this huge crash

behind you and the deck above you

splinters and coming through and landing

about ten feet away from you

is artists Cimber and the way he lands

does not suggest this was a healthy fall

for him

in fact paltin I would like you to roll

96 damage please I lowered this case I

understand there like that was 96 yeah

completely shattering any thought

process ahead I'm jealous

hey that's Mardi sixes that I get to

roll and sneak attacks Wow not a single

six okay 24 excellent all right yeah

when he hits in DF you see artists lying

amidst the wreckage there but he's not

moving then you see this hand to detach

from his face crawl down and start to

pry the ring off his finger do i okay

do I know that he's like he's probably

he probably landed near DF you saw him

go right through the midsection the ship

or you know DF waffles and dragon bait

are hiding out did he die over in a

high-five so work on email ins turn it's

now your turn evil and you can go over

and high-five paulten okay can I do that

on my way down I'm gonna fall out okay

when you land inside the ship you can

see artists kind of lying there amidst

the wreckage and palton severed hand

removing they're trying to remove the

ring from its finger from the course of

time

I'm gonna try to help the hand remove

the ring okay when you do you realize

that artists is kind of staring at you

and the the light in his eyes the blue

light is just sort of gone out and now

you just see his normal eyes and he just

says oh how Lassonde and then he dies

take the ring off and I read it off I

him okay

it doesn't work because he's now in the

sole longer no even like is not

impressed by him dying she's like taking

the ring off he's like I'm dead yeah you

see you see pulsing severed hand run out

with the ring on its finger that's a big

magic evylyn kind of run after you know

she was like yeah yeah you're dying hold

on try some even if I she's like oh oh

no but then she sees the ring the hand

running with the ring and she doesn't

like mom like sort of crawls under the

wreckage of the ship where you can't get

at it alright so we are out of

initiative don't have I seen the hand

bring the ring back you're way too high

for it to get back to you

oh I have to go down to it somehow

elands just running around chasing it

goodbye it might have caught a glimpse

of evil and chasing it and it went

underneath the ship to get away from her

skinny guy yeah you got it

nice can you come tell him to come out

okay um how do I get down there oh wait

oh wait I already it already today yeah

it's on it's on e nope

I'm all out of doors can you levitate

yourself down oh can I only can't do

that

thanks dude so yes you strum a few bars

storm a few bars on your mandolin and

you levitate down to the ground yeah why

not paltin has two ways of flying

whatever yeah

alright and then once you get down to

the ground and over toward the wreckage

of the ship the hand scuttles out toward

the baton and make sure you and you

alone

get the ring a little fist bump alright

like that was a little excessive but

impressive are you gonna let it wear the

ring for the time being my my my

curiosity says yes my brain also says

yes

alright I'm gonna you know what I mean

I'm gonna take the ring off and what are

you gonna do with it once you have it in

hand you realize it's very very very

cold

don't worry I'll put it on don't you put

that on it's got a layer of frost around

yeah don't lie I'll hold on to it okay

lay artists is dead a little bit he's

dead yeah you see but dragon bait has

sort of come out into hiding as well and

he goes over to artists cuz he kind of

knew artists yeah they knew each other

you can say to him that dragon bait

smells like sadness I'm sorry

he smells like roses right now I tried

to save them Strix is like don't worry

I've done this lots of times and she'll

just walk outside with her staff and

start using it as a shovel

oh the ground the ground is so frozen

you can't dig in fire it fire

well looks like he doesn't get a grave

sorry dragon beta tried after hearing

he's like dead dead I look at the ham

I'm just like dude what the hell man you

also also see this blueish radiance

coming out of this chest the sort of

beaming up out of it Oh

strikes is gonna go look into it before

it gets like you see the black egg

inside nestled within do I recognize it

as anything or anything like you can

make it a Czech magical that's eleven

okay you're not exactly sure what it is

but actually eleven is high enough to

recognize at least with one thing and

that you believe that the energy inside

this egg is of a similar type to that of

like a magic missle spell Oh interesting

so it could hmm interesting

I'll kind of point out the other things

ions like look it's got a little keyhole

on it doing it your keys working that I

don't know about my keys but I really

have worked on other stuff I don't know

if you should he should try it

shadows inside it oh it's look he said

systematic missiles inside of here I

don't know specifically badging missiles

on the backside there's this little

clock you know what it's ticking so when

is that code it's not ticking that it's

not you're hearing things guys I'm sorry

to interrupt but you said don't put the

ring on what about for like a second no

he's dead artist is dead but I'm not so

but you saw what it did to him

maybe he could put it on for just a

second and have that bird that he wanted

so bad just for a second and then he

could take it off yeah I mean I saw what

happened to him but I mean he's kind of

a punk anyway so I mean I mean

that's true

like wouldn't you true at all doesn't

you remember the Harper's or something

yeah you what is wrong with you guys I

just wanted to have what he wants you

know what I did the artist we can't have

that happen

you are the only one talking about not

doing bad things and I'm disappointed in

all of you because I swear I'm gonna put

the ring on all right make a charisma

saving throw yep get ready to chop his

hand off that's pretty good what's good

enough

what is pretty good me why you say

pretty good Chris why pretty good and

that's where we'll stop I'm so mad I'm
