welcome to diced camera action

previously previously on the show we had

Chris Perkins as a dungeon master he

will not be joining us tonight as will

be doing another no this would be great

we'll be doing a Chris Perkins less gam

however previously on the show d/f had a

chance encounter with flair all silver

hand within the dungeons of Waterdeep

where she made him captain within the

lords alliance and through that used her

connections to help get him released

back at the Waffle House what everyone

thought to be DF was actually plural the

doppelganger of this interim I'm

currently searching through the house

for something they know that he was

looking for money and something on top

of that along with his friend morphe Oh

disguised as palton real palton along

with Strix and evylyn rather nearby a

nobles house where they were ambushed by

mansion the powerful wizard and his

antara misak's yes yes paltin counter

spelled man shoots power word kill

allowing Strix to turn him into a

chicken while evylyn slaughtered the

rest and through quick quick thinking

Strix then use power their word of

recall to get the rest of them back home

just in time for fake gift after had

some troubles with waffles they all bear

Jencks and net the children bumped into

real Deus where they then took imprison

her and return him back so we're at now

is that we have all returned back to the

waffle house pluriel is still within our

captivity shoved into one of the closets

that still has a door probably we

probably barricaded it with something

yeah sitting in front of it well after

getting some screeches yeah so we are

now at the Waffle House literally just

moments after the previous episode don't

take that out already I just got done

using it sorry

that's fair well those kids sure do

defending the house yeah I mean okay

they're gonna have to be real good

adventures I just wish they would have

actually stabbed at least a couple of

them it looked like NAT was gonna she

had that dagger out

I know and you're so exciting just tell

her to go all the you know just straight

in yeah just right in the torso there's

a pointy head yeah yeah

don't you guys think yes hold that

thought and I immediately go to wherever

it is we're keeping fake D F I'm

assuming closet door well I'm assuming

he's out of the way yeah you got my

money pluriel who disguised himself as a

nobleman that he named Magnus says oh

yes of course

through his cupped hands squeeze around

and throws 21 gold pieces back onto the

floor at zero I think so he's like I

just shuts the door on him

you're pluriel call from inside no home

Paul walks back downstairs it sounds

like alright we can resume the episode

now to get my money back from Florio

alright did you stab him should I can go

back sorry well save it for later okay

cool next time I want to stab them a

little ya know I just got back but

seeing all of this even I was just a way

for such a short time pretty sure this

is a dangerous place to live

and after seeing what happened to jinx

and his a libero stuffed animal and porn

net I already fixed it for him I'll like

hold up oh just a mangled owl bear doll

it's just got like giant stitches I

think he didn't he didn't want it

I'm sure he'll love it but the point is

this place is too dangerous for them

they can't stay here anymore I mean

everywhere is dangerous I this is really

hard for me to say but I agree with the

app and you know anything that you want

to send them away they already know

where they gonna go send them away just

you know bring them not here they can go

wherever they want but the longer they

stay with us the more danger they're in

well that doesn't sound like you're

saying they can go wherever they want

that sounds like you're saying they can

go wherever you want them to no I'm

saying what I'm saying is they can't

stay here because it's too dangerous I

know they're still witnesses we'll keep

tabs on them and keep them safe but here

they're in further danger what if we tie

them together with a rope I feel like

this is what we're talking about

yeah only each of them gets tied

together and then we don't lose them and

then we just tie them to part of the

house or what if I think tying them to

part we're not telling them to any part

of the house what if we find them a home

uh-huh with a gun 'less hippo well let's

see if that's the thing though is

there's gun hippos everywhere that's

true if I've ever heard anything true

yeah they're everywhere you never know

out of the one I've seen they all live

here

so that's true we've made a lot of

enemies at this point and then being

with us is just gonna put them in more

danger right the last thing we need is

more people in our house but we can

protect them it's fine we take care of

them can't we protect them

do they need protecting no let me not

really know they're strong they can take

care of themselves we're also trying to

run a business here and like by the way

I've been looking over numbers and I got

to talk to you about about the margins

and over I don't even have you been

charging for the pies I don't understand

money at all I think she's been giving

them away for free yeah okay so the

first thing about selling a product is

it is not free yeah and everyone roll a

perception check okay I'll roll for the

whole party well evil enrolls a 19

characteristically that's okay Wow I'll

just roll Diaz because I know his will

be amazing 21 Oh

we're gonna fight like I can't see

because of my contacts but it's a four

idea for I'm too busy 15 I'm too busy

like the math lady like thinking about

money

Oh everyone except restricts turns

around and there is a six foot two buxom

redheaded elf

with a grey furry cat just standing

listening to you with a very perplexed

look on her face Trix it's your first

customer that you wait rides real money

really yeah really money money isn't for

money

we have a customer so would you like a

pie actually that is why I'm here oh I

would like a settlor pies actually oh

all right I will get to baking uh do you

know what money is I do and I have some

to pay for the pie that's how you know I

don't know how much they are charging

here at this establishment that's mine

as my party have run into the kitchen to

start making pockets yeah I'll go to the

countertop and start running the till

having me like a rough-hewn would box

yeah there's a box that says no touchie

monies yes it's like filled with like

garbage that like would be put in there

use there's no money in there no point

probably NAT and squiggly and Jenks

sister on by like a little great cat

like crawls up under her shoulder like a

parrot and just sits there I actually

need about 25 pies Wow laughing you had

some available I probably do do you want

them warmed up and do you want ones with

crickets and them because a couple that

have those yes to the first question and

no on the second floor in roots

preferably all right okay yes there may

be a good berry one in there too that'll

kill you yes you should charge extra for

that no I didn't know yeah yeah see and

did you did you want to keep it to have

open while you're oh I would like to pay

you cash money real money when you take

that yeah a half a drink and that's what

the money is called right I don't know

oh the dragons dragons those are the

gold things that I'm not allowed to

touch mm-hmm okay all right I'll go into

the kitchen then and start bringing out

as many pies as I've had pre-made and

I'm sure I have enough I'm probably

prepare why don't you roll a percentile

oh of how many how many pies are there

okay let's see how many pies do I have

look I have 13 pies shockingly low so

how long would it take to prepare the

rest of the pie oh not too long I can go

through a couple lane and get the kids

all that kids can help see see how

useful they are in this household

Matt's Wiggly Jake's the kids are paid

fair wage also they're all well I'm not

here to judge Allah is our Labor's

happened well while we wait for the pies

I couldn't help but overhear your

conversation something about this place

is a dangerous place for children yes

there is a child infestation here

they're not an infestation they're not a

disease they're not a problem they just

they're orphans that we've been looking

after they don't have a home so they

stay with us because having they choose

to live here they

live here which I guess then they're not

really orphans I don't they have parents

have you I have parents everyone has

parents well I'm gonna do all of us have

parents you here like pottery shadow

from a higher Florence Kweli just like

oops I can fix it

kind of wish he had parents well darling

everyone does have parents just

sometimes the parents don't stay around

or something happens to them and they

have to leave I once asked Asmodeus if

he was my dad how'd that turn out he

said no so that was relieving strikes I

don't know too much about your childhood

that's because it was horrible

was it yeah I mean I grew up in the hive

in sigil what's the Hat so the hive is a

really bad place like as bad as it gets

like it smells like poop everywhere

there's water and full of dead bodies

everywhere and when I was little like

super little the only way I made any

sort of Janke was to go to the hive and

a dig bodies out of the stinky fetid

diseased water so what I did is that's

actually that's where my stick came from

you know this stick this one because

they have that water on it before oh

yeah it was all over it do you want to

touch it now all right

yeah that's why cuz this was fruit stick

in the bodies out like that so I would

scoop them and then like then bring him

back oh definitely disinfect that you

might clean it before I flew on it

why did you clean it but now I know I've

never cleaned it cool so that was in my

crotch right sorry but yeah so it's good

for scooping up bodies so if we ever you

know I don't accidentally kill anyone

else week I can pick them up with this

why would you collect Bob Oh cuz you

sell them to the mortuary Oh Ronnie for

 so you do understand money for Bob

I mean for bodies but you don't charge

for anything else that's dumb oh so why

you do that right food not worth money

body's worth money okay well I have to

make them into zombies so that they can

you know work the mortuary this place

sounds horrible mmm it's pretty horrible

Evelyn

we were there oh well you weren't in the

hive I think we are in the market is

right I don't remember oh it's hard I

mean I'd only heard what you've told

about that did that was district I mean

that we would have known if we were in

the hive does real bad sometimes when

things smell real bad I block them out

oh that's very much is that what you

block me out no I never block you out oh

do I

I don't putting down my body stick now

well how did it become magical then I

don't know I just drew a bunch of things

on it at one point you just drew stuff

on it yeah I just threw a bunch of

things on it I started doing magic like

those those runes and sigils you just

well that was afterwards I spent a

minute I escaped single in the night

because my bakery I worked out was

burned down or exploded I don't really

know but everyone died and there was

blood everywhere

I'm just covered in blood and then I was

left there alone and then I ran away and

I got out of sigil somehow I found a

portal key and just managed to tumble

through a portal into one of the gate

towns then I rolled around those for a

while which was terrible and people

chased me and tried to kill me and I

think I worked in a tiny bakery there

for a while but the bakery and sigil was

when I worked in the most and then I

fell into the FEI wild and then I found

my grandma baba Yaga ha your actual

grandmother so not my rosy grandmother

that's my new grandmother this was my

old grandmother and I really hope they

don't meet because that's gonna be real

bad you know that very significant is it

yes

doughnuts that are shaped like sigil

right so uh that was 25 pies that's

right ok cool just making sure please

don't leave yet we need this money

really okay thank you yes

you mean you enchanted your staff yeah I

enchanted it and Baba Yaga taught me

that I had magic me and I taught her how

to make Donuts

donut shaped like sigil yeah I mean who

knows how long I was there is probably

like six seven years I don't know I was

a kid and then I wasn't a kid anymore so

maybe it was longer than that I have no

concept of time did how did you know she

was your grandma I mean she wasn't

really I just called her that oh you

chose your family yes I chose I mean I

just kind of stumbled there and she'd

was real creepy but she had a house and

she didn't kill me so I chose it and

then she'd wanted to learn how to make

donuts family yeah there's nothing wrong

with me ah so what happened with Baba

Yaga then one day after I had made her a

bunch of pies and she was happy and you

know telling me stories like she usually

did at night usually about like weird

murders and things and maybe creatures I

just walked out the door to go do my

normal daily routine of feeding the

chickens and making sure there are no

people impaled on the skulls and doing

all that kind of stuff and I wasn't

there anymore I was I was outside dagger

room I was in the bushes you didn't do

that some other unseen force

no she just I guess she was done with me

I don't know did that make you feel sad

I made me feel worried because I didn't

have any food but I did have my body

stick so then I started getting better

at magic you know killing squirrels and

and in all the little things I could

find around you know whatever world I

was and I didn't know at the time and

getting chased by farmers I got chased a

lot yeah they didn't like me at all

you're real good at running I sure AM

that's what I learned that's good for

exercising and training and survival no

it's owned real fast I have heard of

Baba Yaga what is very significant the

fact that you're still here am i it does

not work to see if they're there or not

a doppelganger does not work unrelated

but yeah she was nice to me she decide I

mean I definitely saw her be mean to

other people but she was nice to me

great yes you seem to turn out fine yeah

what do you know about Baba Yaga maybe

you guys can reminisce about your family

no I'm good

yeah she looks a little like doesn't why

no Baba Yaga is an arch Fay I know that

now because I I read books about bad

things that happened to me that was one

of them sometimes we don't like to

relive the bad parts that's true yes no

that's why I crawl that's why I crawl

into my panic cupboard sometimes that's

in the kitchen

well that's very soon that's good if you

heart maybe there's some extra pies in

the panic okay you're right

I'll run into the panic cupboard okay no

crickets please or any other rodents or

small insect it's my teeth no longer oh

okay I'll have a little bit of time

would you like a drink yes yes we do

have an entire wine cellar with fine

selections of whatever is left over yes

a very limited selection due to needing

more inventory there's definitely none

stored anywhere else in the house what

would you like I would like it's

something red and I will pay for it

fantastic red is all we have Oh walk

over and walk over the tavern pour some

wine it's like here's a there you go

it's a red I don't know why would I

imagine the wine being on tap glass

goblet cup what is it in is it and how

clean is it

well no strikes keeps everything that's

that gets eaten very clean she is

concerned about the health of the

customers she doesn't do anything with

the taproom though so it's probably

super dusty and is I don't know like if

whatever was in their Tap Room's kind of

Bolton's just place I feel like the

publican would spend time polishing the

glasses so they might be clean

it's a it's a goblet with like a hand

holding it okay so pumpkins been

spending the money he makes on custom

glasses and then complains and I know

make enough money I see how it is this

is very impressive

all they could do events here yes like

parties we could I had some events here

yeah did you say party we should throw a

party

party always go well why not

don't you like parties I'm in the

kitchen well you like no you do have

children hand perhaps themed parties

aren't good for the children being

around unless you but I work or

something and as you say that each kid

like brings out a pie and just like

sensitive back in the file and goes back

in the case so they are working okay

well these you have that they're not

working they choose to help yes we don't

choose to house them for it right we're

we're not going to make any of the kids

work it's important that children learn

to do their chores around the house yep

chores make a divorce yes it's all

situational really so this conversation

you're having you're saying that you

think that this place is too dangerous

for kids well yes I mean thankfully you

haven't noticed any at the scorch marks

to which there are like several yeah

like foundation is questionable at this

point

look I just keep telling them that you

have to demo to Renault and look at our

fancy new Tower we rebuilt that like I

don't know a week ago is a nice hour

that's why there's some dust don't mind

the dust we're almost always in

transition pretty much so also like as I

say that while you're holding it you

feel the hand like kind of crawl off and

surprise it's just a bowl I do have to

admit that isn't very safe I'm looking

around for the kids he washed himself

you see those little white beholder so

he's a little tiny tiny gazer a tiny

albino beholder and he just like floats

in and he's like and he like drops one

of the pies like see everything there's

some drool on it and then he just was

like yeah

chaton yeah a little witch and I have a

discount on this one now I did I did

here these are the best pies in town Oh

where'd you hear that

yawning portal I'm talking about it I'm

scared of Durnan why I'm scaring why no

I'm scared of everyone hmm well maybe

you can stall this debate for us since

you're somewhat of a neutral party who

you've seen the children and if this

place was say constantly attacked or

exploded or infiltrated or full of guns

possibly locked more guns at least two

guns handful of explosive barrels mm-hmm

oh one of which the kids rolled down the

stairs oh yeah I gotta clean up yeah

clean it up put a pin in that the point

is like a lot of things have happened

here and there

long story short they're key witnesses

in an upcoming trial that were actually

trying to keep safe for them did you did

you mention when like those assassins

came up through the basement did you did

you mention that I did not okay cool

just in case holder's they also came up

from the base oh yeah they did they did

do that and look I don't know why

everyone's so focused on all the bad

things that happen here there lots of

wonderful I didn't say I was bad we all

learned what undead beholders look we've

had two wonderful fireside nights with

the children we tuck them in at night

and they get lots of love and they get

to freely express rate we talk man at

night I always I cut a door and I say I

hope you're live in the morning

squigglies like licking some of the pies

or do whatever you want I don't know hmm

I make a few more just in case yeah I I

come out there are they're in the oven

I'm like they're fine they'll just be

cooking and you know that I will get

them when Alby comes out to tell me that

they're ready I'm just saying I feel

like especially UDF are always looking

at things like they must be dangerous

and they must be evil and I think you

could use some optimism and I just don't

know why you have that focus because

most things are dangerous and evil have

you paid attention at all for the last

few years I see a world bathed in light

the light of Lysander shines down upon

us every day just like the light of this

fire shines deep into our souls someone

call me when this yeah I can I have one

of those drinks here's the thing we're

in water deep it's a very dangerous

place honestly yeah dangerous is signal

or the hive just saying yeah oh well in

that case the fact that they have a

place to stay is good you know they

could be on the streets that is bad

there are a lot of guilds out there and

a lot of factions that would take

advantage of them there quick question

if I make pies without talking to those

people are you mad at me who the Guild's

Oh is there like a Baker's game there is

Oh which they did come by and we got a

license

[Music]

my point is the world is it's dangerous

yes thank you but if you know the world

is dangerous it's dangerous out there

the dangerous in here

then let's unpack this a little bit why

are you so concerned that it's dangerous

not a concern just oh it's concerned

yeah you're doing you're doing that

thing where you fold your arms and look

they're not I don't know you but yes you

are I would I would consider your

posture concern laughs you hunch and

then you do this like

look I'm Dean I survived long enough on

the streets the kids did before we even

saw them so who's to say that they're

not capable

Nats very capable I believe in her

so you just put her back out on the

street you think that'd be safe okay I'm

not saying not saying that it's

something we're gonna abandon them did

you find family out on the streets

before us I mean yeah of course you were

gonna really before us Oh backstory I

mean I didn't have family until strix

I've I mean a big bottle I've met a lot

of people that's where you are sorry you

can't hear it before we met well I mean

like I got jobs at the yawning portal

I've known like there's malkor there's

my exes I'm sorry

exes plural I've never heard this story

by the way why wouldn't you tell me

don't look at me don't look at me like

because it's not know what that's a

story if anything it's just proven how

dangerous the world can be and it's hard

to trust people and I know the kids

trust us and they can come back whenever

they want but I'm just saying that's not

safe for them to stay here you're

getting so much out of him you should

stay yeah I'm talking how did you do

that I'm just putting chairs behind you

guys kind of pushing you towards fire

yes doesn't realize he's yeah whatever

wine is left just hand you as you're

talking just yeah strikes just like

looks just like what does exes mean mmm

there was are they dead I don't know for

sure are they dead no they're not dead

Oh aren't you so lucky

sorry we're not we're not at we're not

at that point the episode of my bad I

think I skipped a few points ahead well

I'm sure it's fine I it just means maybe

there were some special people in Dee's

life before you hit I mean everyone

needs people in their life that's true

see everyone why don't you talk about

them maybe it'll make you feel better

and we'll know more about you and

understand you better

you already look way better fine this

was it was before I'd even much direct

Sonny we know how long a few years at

the very least and you know I was still

doing my small-time adventuring whenever

I could just you know like I said trying

to sweep up after other people went in

just collect up whatever scraps I could

just to you know survive and I guess at

some point someone must have caught wind

of me or seen me maybe I opened the

lockbox and at the owning portal or

something on now but that's when I had

met Melissa she very tall dark-skinned

muscular I don't think she was half work

but it wouldn't surprise me if you know

she had some of that blood her lineage

and and with her was Kagan Kagan was

much further than me and he was it was

nice and gentle but they had they asked

me to to join them to go on adventures

with them so we actually worked all

three of us together

and that was good for a while it really

was and I don't regret any of that and

we got to you know we have actually made

a little bit more money and we got to

split amongst us so like there were

happy times and you know we are actually

enjoyed each other's company

at some point you just get used you get

used yeah what do you mean it means it's

because of them that I ended up in the

water deep dungeons in the first place

so we can kill them Strix I'm just

saying

well what put you in the dungeons they

told me about a big score that was right

here within water deep an abandoned

mansion more or less you know sometimes

when Noble and rich people own multiple

houses in different cities it's amazing

the landed gentry my parents do that

what did that like that I guess he went

to some other city and had not been back

to water he for some time so his mansion

was told me abandoned so and there was

the talk of like about just a massive

massive emerald somewhere deep inside I

don't know who's got a doubter how

whatever but so our goal was to have our

own little adventure right here within

water deep and that mansion was not

abandoned but you were gonna steal it I

didn't know what they said it was just

the same as empty they said the nobles

were dead and then they got it to you

they got it and then they left me behind

so that when the guards caught me they

wouldn't go after them why would they do

that because the world's a dangerous

place no people are dangerous the

world's not dangerous and there's good

people in it like all of us you can

choose the good people and good people

will stand up for you when bad people do

bad things to you well yeah it just it

takes me a long time to figure out who's

good I guess that's just so that we're

all very clear

also very neutral plus I think there's a

spell for that detect evil and good

there's no like detect meaning good I

don't know that's true I'm sorry you got

hurt that way dia yeah if we were there

that wouldn't have happened I mean if

you guys were there what have we got in

that mess in the first place and someone

that you you loved and trusted that much

to if they were your ex whatever that

means exes but yeah and yeah it did hurt

huh I mean I've said it before and I

still mean it I'm not a thief I don't

want to do that why did you join up with

them then guess I wanted somewhere to

belong they made me they made me feel

good at the time maybe they even tricked

me I don't know but they were kind to me

and they were nice they were

affectionate and you know believed in me

I guess know maybe was all set up for

the eventual abandonment

so what happened to them do you know I

don't I mean they closed up the latch of

their rooftop I was holding on to the

cut rope that was the last I saw is that

why you hate being locked up so much

yeah what happened in the dungeons yeah

how long were you there I don't know

what did they do to you it was really

really dark got to have sunlight for one

hour a day Thanks you never want to

bring you a pie or sneak in like I did

last time no that was mr. X which was

very dangerous and stupid of you but

thank you see this is if you had a

family maybe they would give you some

perspective on the situation you

wouldn't have gotten take advantage of

yeah that's a great point such as these

children living in our house may get

guidance from dear squidly is now

licking gunpowder I like this stuff

better squidly I pay you when sandwiches

come back so are you my mom or not no

I'm not your mom just because I'm horns

doesn't mean I'm your mom I don't know

about that he just runs off I'm gonna go

find the gun I wouldn't recommend though

if you're going to keep the children

that you there's some regulations set

boundaries mocks things up my shelves

the boundaries being the front door in

which they can stay out of it somewhere

else that is the start of learning how

to establish boundaries exactly so we

should find somewhere more appropriate

for them no the thing is that I think

children need to be given the freedom to

experience their childhood and learn

those boundaries for themselves I think

children should live

and here there is a increasingly smaller

chance of that happen this is a good

point

you should just train them better how to

use those daggers I'm trying to teach

it's magic but jinx doesn't know

anything about magic which is really

important by the time I was eight I

could stab better than any stuff in

there wait why do well yeah

at eat well of course I mean daggers are

basic I mean I started with daggers at

what like six and a half just let you

know that's not actually normal I mean

it was at paladin training I'm sure

since I was a little young for my class

but not too much your squiggly upstairs

I found the gun I'll be right back I'm

gonna go take that away from him yes

probably that's all right

you are his mother after I'm not in

I go upstairs and all you hear to like

this wrestling going on like don't give

it to me no that's not yours hey y'all

just said you're not your mom no I'm not

your mom what do you have that's not a

gun cabinets cabinets

how are the guns boss yes that they

can't open with magic hmm yes I still

don't really understand what that thing

does well it's probably for the best

I would like to hear more about this

paladin training yeah I agree it took me

years to learn how to use a dagger

meditation myself well how do you think

that paladin's get so ready to protect

the city what was I when we met 2002

base stats like well thank you but I

mean I don't know I I I left my family

home at six and went to the spires and

bother sunbright was my mentor oh that

guy we saw him go and get incinerate in

flames right that was the one oh yeah

but he's gonna be fine

we're gonna bring him back to life just

I mean I've been I've been dead how many

times now I'm fine that's really not

good for your skin dude it'll actually

aid you by dying what do you have any of

that no I mean I can get some Idol a lot

of goats we're your parents kicked you

out when you were six they didn't kick

me out they devoted my life to the

service of Lysander and water deep so

they kicked you out well they made you I

mean I want it to go I mean my dad was a

paladin of Lysander and he was a great

adventurer and I thought he was just the

bee's knees and he I wanted to be just

like him and it seemed like the right

choice since you know my brother was

learning how to run things for them he

was the oldest until he was going to

kind of take over as you know the lordly

duties and I would just be sitting

around not helping and I wanted to help

and and I had you know I had some

trouble getting around at first with my

leg the way it was but my dad brought me

home these flying boots that are magical

and

that helped me get around just fine and

so then I was ready to go to training as

you do when you are six sorry there's a

lot to unpack there I actually agree

with you that's pretty intent when I go

first cuz I got plenty so did you have

any friends when you're a kid as a kid

well I mean yeah I was like Lysander

doesn't count

agree you know in my my order there were

plenty of other children and we we got

to have some recreation time each day

but we were sparring partners and I got

along real well and had you know

relationships with some of them that

were special too and don't talk too many

of them anymore but that's cuz we're all

doing our duty so you had colleagues yes

there were six yeah well I was there a

long time okay

I mean you don't learn everything when

you're six and then go out and I serve

levander now I'm a baby you know what's

your favorite game from when you were

six my favorite game game my favorite

game was sweep the leg dodged the staff

that's not that's not a game that was

like my favorite game what was yours

don't drown while trying to pull the

body out of the wall that sounds fun it

was fun also not a game I'm sorry I feel

like I need to be very clear those are

not those aren't well here's the thing I

don't begrudge my childhood I learned a

lot of important things and I made my

choice and I serve Lysander which is the

greatest blessing of my life but I will

say I was very lonely a lot of the time

very lonely

and I wouldn't wish a life of loneliness

on any child and I would have given

anything to choose to be with my family

so squidly can keep licking whatever

he's looking I locked him in a closet

okay got lucky child the closet he

thought that he had a candle and he was

holding it to the gun and it was just a

bad situation so I just locked him in

that he's playing with waffles it's fine

okay it's okay I'm licking the doorknob

Oh put into the cottage his waffle

squished in the closet with the little

grey cat hops in your lap that you're

really distraught about this memory

round we don't need any more pets do you

said that like 30 times mm-hmm

please don't give us your cat absolutely

not

well hell I mean like how strong is it

to be useful

does it have any pain it's not

combat-ready has it not okay it was it

like shoot lasers not yet poison darts

not yet I do think disintegration rays I

do think though that there's a point

this cat is trying to make is that even

one shouldn't have been lonely and I had

stinky so stinky and I went on all kinds

of adventures I mean cranium rats don't

talk unless there's a whole bunch of

them then they'll kill you but one can

be your friend and so it would have been

better if you'd had a friend and I think

it's good that the kids have us cuz

we're like we're like their cranium rats

and maybe yeah and maybe they know what

they need you know like the cat knew we

needed the best pets in the whole world

so I was that was lonely as a kid and it

was fine I think I turned out great

as I'm just like chugging whatever you

think children should be lonely I just

don't think it's the worst thing for

them

you want would you I'll be you only kid

or a dead kid I mean um I wasn't I

wasn't lonely or dead but I was talking

to a cranium rat and I had to sweep up

bodies but I mean you know that's

I lived I'm okay there are more options

are there she's so smart you get more

power for being smart thank you

oh wait I'm giving them away talked

about this I know you get called an

upsell you didn't say it's for free so

well you also had juniper for a while

right well I found juniper when I was

already a paladin she was oh no starving

on the streets I just fed her a lot

that's how I make friends yeah I know it

shows you a sense of responsibility what

there are there's some lessons maybe you

don't know that you learned but you

found responsibility by feeding oh yeah

I'm responsible for everyone that's my

job

that's Yuans healthy I mean I don't know

why are you on my case all the time

lately um excuse me

another case I'm just like young ditz hi

I called died I call things as I see

them it's nice to me just I do my does

fine hokage says I does so I Do's so

what about this childhood of yours so

lonely tell us about us a little while

we're sitting here gathered around the

fire waiting for pies oh wow well

recently I learned that my parents were

murdered to death is that why you're

wearing your your fancy coat because

you're you're trying to be dark yeah

that party ended a while ago don't try

to write my motivations out for me I'm

my own character

it makes me feel pretty are you just

anyway your dead parents oh right my dad

parents who are dead murdered so they

were killed by this guy who I had the

opportunity to kill multiple times and I

didn't because it was the right thing to

do

or where the hell that means

so yeah and I didn't even remember it

until we were in this very horrible

place where I remembered a lot of things

that I wish I hadn't oh yeah

interesting so see I'm doing great I got

my I got it figured out I got it all

together ish but aren't our memories

even good or bad memories aren't they

important to who we are don't you want

to remember things I mean I got some

pretty sick powers from them so I guess

so optimism right optimism optimism wait

well sure oh sorry kitty III don't think

does they can't want to treat I'm gonna

give him the treat she loves treat okay

[Music]

here's the thing if we don't remember

the bad things we can't learn to have

them not happen again so if if those

people hadn't have been so awful you

wouldn't have known to look for people

that weren't I mean I guess that's how

that works and gross right and you know

I was lonely as a kid but I learned how

to freaking smash that poop out of evil

things so you know I can't be upset

about that yeah and you know my parents

were murdered so I'm like oh next time

when a loved one's about to get killed I

can stop it oh wait no I couldn't

over and over and over again that's fun

Oh what do you need a drink

I need another take whatever bottles are

on the counter and just oh god yes

please Andrew starts sliding moreover at

a

I just like I just grab hand drew

holding just holding a hand holding it

you said memories I thought just the

memory of your parents came back what

else came back I mean there was that all

you know dead wife thing that we touched

on briefly that do you want to talk more

about her want is an interesting word

for that I agree yes sometimes it's good

to share it and kind of get it out there

sometimes it just feels bad and

sometimes it feels bad but it's probably

important for exposition the further the

plot so I guess I'd never understand

half the things you're saying that's

fine good maybe he needs some pie maybe

I'll make him feel more comfortable all

right I'll go get pie for everyone I was

meeting a pie for D if anyway because it

looks sad so I'm gonna go get pie

everyone gets pie yay well there goes

the profits enjoy our pie a little bit

before I met this bunch I was married to

my wife we've been married for probably

a couple years ish this is good we had

we had a good thing going we had a

pretty pretty steady income we had a

really nice place was actually like

really like close onto like these noble

houses speaking it was a rental we you

know did you destroy it huh

like we do why would why would you

destroy your home that makes no sense

well like I said it was a rental like

you know I mean you know Waterdeep

property value it's all out of the place

it was like right before the bubbles so

yeah you know the owners market anyway

so yeah it was it was good was that the

whole like um watered avian dream if

that's a thing

Oh on the seaward sure okay for whatever

it is but um yeah and then one day I was

out and playing a gig that don't they

need to stop cheering during the sad

story really and it was I don't know I

just had this weird feeling I was like I

was like maybe I shouldn't take this job

like maybe because we're pretty set on

rent this month and you know I haven't I

hadn't been spending enough time with

her because I've been really busy trying

to you know work cuz there's that whole

you know like the the whole you know

creative worry of just like when's this

all gonna disappear I better work as

much as I can while I have this cards

you know it's relatable

and so I took this job and it was just

like any other gig no it's a fine show

stayed a little late for a couple drinks

with the staff

I came home and you know City Guard was

there it was a crowd around the house

and went up to the room they insisted I

not going but I went in because I was

like has this is a fine idea and there

was just blood just everywhere

song just on the rug splattered on the

walls and ceiling their bodies face was

just mangled beyond recognition it was

barely anything left of her but it it

was her that was that was how many how

many of the the strawberry pies by the

way that was new and slates fives good I

just really want to make sure this order

goes through five and okay or cherry

yeah yeah they were like there were like

chunks of some kind of body just like

all over the bed looked looked Strix is

like eating cherry pie and she's like

maybe less scary and they I mean there's

not much else to that well why did they

ever find out who and why and why no I

found out why I never found out who just

all they told me was that someone you

had to cover their tracks why would

someone do that well let's find them and

kill them too

there's nothing left there there was

that was the weirdest thing there was no

there was like nothing it was just in

and out but you know such good magic now

you could do your magic and find these

people and do what how am I gonna take

them to jail who what what I don't know

who did it I do have a we can ask around

did you murder this

I think Iceman's maybe the reason he

always drinks so much as you didn't

really want to remember or look he

wanted to forget oh it does help that is

a fair point was did you find a mosque

covered coin oddly specific question yes

why we need to talk release uh okay can

they might know yeah you did

what are you saying gif I'm saying I

don't think they did it but if you found

that mas coin that means it's they know

who did because they're part of that

same crime family okay see I'm just I'm

just you know I'm just gonna lay it out

there you know we're doing full

transparency right now did your ex kill

my wife

no no no no they sounded really mean I

mean you don't know him but she

definitely knew about it she was telling

me about how there was going to be an

upcoming big take what was supposed to

be a soon-to-be vacant house and it just

to me it sounded like just straight-up

theft so I told her I had no part of it

and I didn't want to do it I that's all

I know

it just it lines up too much so somebody

so somebody had planned someone planned

killing her and then told other people

about it so they could steal from it and

you're and then she was just like okay

yeah boy you know how to pick them don't

you

sure do cool

maybe she I don't know how we find her I

thought we weren't gonna find the mean

people oh no we're gonna find this one

and kill yep I can Paulie more if them I

really don't like killing people but

we'd always need more chickens look I

don't know but I've ways of finding out

and I'll do my best and you have my word

on that

as your friend please don't call me Olga

game

[Applause]

[Applause]

there was a cat go oh she's here

somewhere I'm sure she'll come back soon

maybe she's playing with the children I

found a cat I'm licking the kid take up

the stairs how'd it get in here the

door's locked

so this mysterious redheaded woman it

disappears up the stairs

leaving the four of you alone downstairs

by the fire this is just this is good

this openness our hearts are open

Lysander is here with us I only like

nights where death is working Paulson is

drunk I'm panicking and you're talking

to Lysander so most nights these nights

where we just stare at the floor just to

scary

why are used a they're scary everyone

has so many secrets well

but what secrets are there less that we

just learn everything there possibly is

to know about everybody here yes we did

[Music]

now I have more questions for you I'm an

open book

sure rewind a little bit you said that

your brother was going to take over a

lordly duties well yeah you know my

family the Marr things the manor and the

whole you know holdings and all that and

they it's a government type position but

it's you know it's very provincial so

it's no big deal

this sounds like a big deal oh you don't

think such as big deal is everything's a

big deal nothing's a big deal I'm just

evil and I'm just adventure and I'm just

here it's to this friend were you

supposed to like be a government person

yeah or a princess are you a princess

well not exactly I mean it just depends

on your I mean no not you stop princess

I'm like my technical honorific would

you lady is that a prince there's still

lady of the house I don't mean I don't

pay much attention to how those things

work cuz when I became a pallet and I

gave up all those things but you know

Bratton still back in our hometown and

running things just like my mama used to

and he's doing a fine good job and

doesn't definitely doesn't want my help

so I'm here in water tea I asked you a

question will you answer it honestly I'm

always honest did you become a paladin

to run from your home duties

well I guess I didn't really choose it

at all what have you chosen I guess I

chose this well I'm glad you did you

know I guess that's kind of what what

I've been afraid of is I I've never

loved anything as much as I love this

except Lysander of course but uh I kind

of worried once we came back here I'd

have to go back into paladin mode and uh

the church might make me take on other

duties that I wouldn't be able to live

here anymore I wouldn't be able to let

me adventure anymore for what it's worth

we were afraid of that too it's true

they kind of statue of you have a stack

of you that's that was weird weird yeah

you thought they're gonna like make you

work again or something and then we

wouldn't people hang out with you or

suddenly you'd be too good with for us

or something yeah

too good that's why I hated that statue

I didn't want that attention I just want

to be me we just want to be here with

you looks good we all like you Thanks

even when I talk about Lysander no

sometimes don't make the sad face

calling him but hander just for you

that's true you did yes it's the little

things the redheaded woman comes down

the stairs with the three kids oh boy

they stand in front of you and well have

you asked them what they want that is a

great idea wait what that's like

standing at attention in front of DES

like squidly has like scratch marks on

his face the cat didn't like me its tail

is just like tanks is probably like just

like a holding is like sad stitched

together aloe vera doll just kind of

crying a little cuz he really hates it

[Music]

it's not my strikes made it scary

strikes can you just like do the mmm fix

it yeah is that what I should do he

wants it give him whatever he wants

that's how to deal with children watch

that's all prestidigitator the Albert

also look prettier and he's back and he

like bugs a LeBaron Strix is just like I

don't understand it looks fine

it did it looked very nice I even put

the bloodstains on it you put

bloodstains on it yeah good to be

accurate that makes that squiggly he's

like I liked it better before thank you

it's nots my son thanks it's really not

a jerk

squiggly you like living here don't you

yeah I like the the guns in all the

fights and the explosions and it's

really cool I found a knife not had a

knife and have you learned many valuable

adventuring skills wow you've lived here

getting really good at licking stuff

have you developed a taste profile that

allows you to identify rare items oh

yeah I know what gunpowder tastes like I

know I don't know what that dirt tastes

like I do know that I know

that's about it you tasted a cat I did

you what just a little lick it's a great

cat and it's like Diaz will approach net

and be like net where do you want to be

with you this place is dangerous every

place is dangerous what she says hey

don't worry she pulls out the dagger see

that's the nice tanks pulls out his wand

and he's just like yeah squidly takes

out the gun yeah I found it again a

weird like shimmering shield type thing

I always forget to cast that spell smart

probably a smart idea that I know you

can handle this thank you very proud

death walks up and turns back towards

the tail it's supposed some sombitch

yeah strict soul look it at jinx and be

like do you want to stay here and he'll

just like hold his aloe vera be like

well I want to learn magic like you

thank you all right

you told me to give them whatever they

wanted you should teach him a spell

right now yeah it'd be harder than that

and he might not actually I mean I'm not

I'm a sorcerer I'm not a wizard I don't

he's a sorcerer I ever get him a book

goes up more are you a wizard oh then

you can you can give them a scroll or

something

whoa whoa there's nice spells like

levitate just let him make some pretty

lights or something it'll make him feel

dancing lights just casts dancing lights

so here look can I do I can't pretend he

does it okay jinx hold your wand up

[Laughter]

several glimmering dancing lights start

like twirling around jing says he just

like keeps playing with it once everyone

else sees the spell yeah that like drops

the dagger and is making his little owl

bear dance I'm like Strix looks at me

and she's like oh he's happy I mean they

I mean he'll learn eventually these kids

has interests and they're interesting to

be nurtured Sidley is like Eldin the gun

like facing him like did I do this right

get somewhat take that away from me

you're holding like walks up to squid

Lee he just kind of takes it like crotch

is down he's like hey man I know you and

me don't talk much mainly cuz playing

two characters talking to each other is

a little weird it's like why but do you

want to stay here goes yeah I want to

live with mom I'm not your father

it's like okay I don't know if that

helps but it's an answer

out look if anyone came looking for the

children if there had been any

indication whatsoever that there was a

home that was missing them we checked I

mean

just because they have a home doesn't

mean they want to be there good pony

that is a good point it makes me feel

like less of a bad person I do want to

be in your where you came from

it was cold under the bridge NAT just

picks up the dagger stands at attention

next to death again she wants to be here

Jane Jenks will just hey mean Jenks is

still freaked out by the lights I think

it also means he likes it here yeah come

let's go to the let's go to the kitchen

children while the adults talk amongst

themselves three adults tecnique yes Oh

are we technically like 80 yeah that's

weird

uh-huh I mean how does resurrection

really affect your age I'm not I'm still

worried about my skin is just some goats

but if we get probably it's I did the

math once it's like fifty goats to fill

a bathtub

it's like fifth it's like so many goats

I don't want to have to you keep

bringing up all these goats and I've

never seen one I'm getting no no it was

when I was in burrow via for the 80

years Oh 50 years I can't I can't mass

it's no one can keep track of these

times anyway I took I learned from one

of the hags there I think it was bauble

of saga I remember I know a couple of

them goats blood you just bathe and

goats blood you can extend your age it's

that simple

uh-huh I mean you probably have to do it

like in some evil cursed land like

burrow via maybe not here and I don't

really want to kill the goats anymore

I didn't mind burrow via so much what

have you ever heard of Stockholm

Syndrome

to look it up why is everything I say

wrong all the time now that it's right

that's it just was not right you like

Perot via MIT

we're in the church you're all liars huh

I know he did say that you were so bad I

said at once that you turned and like

that's I just thought that after all

this time maybe I don't know nevermind

you're right you are the one that calls

it like you see it and you've never seen

anything other than that apparently I

mean just for it evil and sake let me

just throw this out on the table are we

ready for this you met the Raven Queen

the power that's the same as Lysander

very real she's just super crazy

super nice my my dad's not toward

Lysander I prayed to him once I did yeah

it was when you died and I was very nice

to him see you you pray till a phantom I

guess I can read to the ring yeah oh my

God he's answering he always answers you

just may not hear it exactly as you

think you

because like sorry the the we don't have

wedges so it was hard to hear you can

you like project it this way I can't

hear always answers just not exactly as

you think he will okay convenient it's a

cool it's a cool guy let's see you know

died over and over it's good feature I'm

fine now they're worse than a death

living 50 years alone you know arguably

I'm better now

remember he blessed me with that boom

it's true I'm stronger than I've ever

been

you also have your boots now well I've

had those a long time well yeah but

still I'm sure that was a blessed thing

from yeah why do you always wear those

boots why would I not wear the boots I

mean like always you're always flying

you never walk I hate walking it hurts

that's fair walking hurts well sometimes

if I walk too long on my leg you know my

leg you know stops below the knee like I

have a prosthetic you've never noticed

that no I just thought your leg was

extra pretty that's so sweet

no yeah I mean the boots kind of help

you know help me get around that's why

my dad brought him for me and walking

sucks and thighs pretty that's honestly

why I thought you were flying all the

time it was a flourish thing well thank

you

the redhead comes back out with like

five pies see that there there's still

more baking there's like little smoke

coming out I don't know what to do with

them but I think they're making a little

mess in there

they're a little rowdy you should train

them Strix could you yeah and I just

like taking when I turn around and go

spray the stoves hot should I lick it

that might cool it off and you hear just

like things falling down and yeah smells

good though hmm

so have you ever had pets before I mean

you had to walk have we had Nets the

gizzard flies back in and just like

drops and other pies like here's the I

love stairs what why we're so rude we

didn't ask what your cat's name oh this

is RPG our PT should be waffles is it

okay to introduce waffles to RPG giant

Albert oh oh and RPG is just like

waffles it babies like she's actually

quite gentle and trained we treat her

better than the kids smell smells his

face kind of lays slowly kind of touches

his face office gets real low like this

with their little beak and then just

wraps both paws around and rubs it off

on him and then kind of curls up kind of

like I peek out from the kitchen I'm

like is there but I mean animals that

you have to care for you have to make

sure they're fed on time they leave the

house and use the waffles the leaves

pies and whatever she kills in battle oh

that's good but I'm talking about caring

for creatures pretty blatant Legion mice

oh I know

wait come here I'm gonna call Simon

Topher

this in this wild sized wooden dog

dressed like a jester

waddles up right Colten like he's not an

animal it's not really a kid he's

something though and I say hi the doll

kill the song looks over at you just

goes okay I really don't like this I'm

very uncomfortable right now if I

supposed to look at it well how do you

he's fine he's gone through like it

leads to alignment shifts so like he's

really friendly he's good you don't have

to worry about him either that's kind of

it's just

yeah that's not that doesn't make me

feel good Simon has been palton has

raised Simon to be quite a important

part of our adventuring party he carries

the wine he shoots poisoned darts only

when it's appropriate and skill darts

he's also a great swimmer doesn't even

need to hold his breath because he

doesn't breathe I didn't know he could

swim that's not the point

yes but what it what are its needs

does it have needs yeah that you have to

pay attention to on the regular he gets

really lonely we we did neglect to think

about the fact that he couldn't express

himself and recently with the help of

NAT taught him sign language so now we

can actually speak to him

how are you know sign language oh yeah

he know sign language Matthew how he's

doing

yeah ask him

how are you he's always done ever since

we Tom sign language and we've been you

know making him more involved he's been

a lot better since he tried to jump off

a building and run out into traffic

don't forget why I blew up the turret

what you didn't hear that I think in the

spirit of secret sharing maybe it's time

that we talk to me about the turret oh

right he doesn't know oh he doesn't know

that no how do I forget well you're his

parents so you tell them yep and you're

the sober parent I don't think it's my

place I'm in no place to drive this

trade record Simon in searching for

companionship may have misunderstood how

to play well with other children and may

have locked a neighbor child in a cage

in the turret he did what just four

turns gone few days that's not okay no

it's okay he just wanted to like take

his soul so he could be a real boy no

that's not okay it's not you're right it

technically is kidnapping but we taught

him what kidnapping was and we made him

take the boy right back and we bribed

the kid with the with juniper which is

why juniper is gone it was okay what's

that now yeah did you know this juniper

is gone

she's very quiet and PC who's Jennifer

the was her mouse my bat little mouse

but now he was just collateral apology

for juniper juniper was being neglected

somewhat here anyway

you know what day if you're right you

are a bad judge of people

anyway the we return the child he seemed

like he was okay yeah and he understood

and he lives over there and plays with

juniper and we see him every once in a

while and Simon isn't as lonely because

you know sign language now and I blew up

the turret so you couldn't find any

evidence of the kidnapping which in

hindsight might have been not a great

idea probably like a undecided I'll take

that great that's a great way to build

trust by hiding stuff like that by

destroying evidence even hurt you

Oh are we talking about hiding stuff

[Applause]

I I understand that this I'm not mad

it's fine it's making the crazy face

sure everything is fine just her

everything is fine as long as Simon

understands that you don't lock children

in case you don't kidnap people and you

don't hold anyone hostage Simon do you

understand these things you kinda good

I'm glad I'm glad you're there to teach

them I'm promised not to destroy

evidence again even if it'll make you

sad thank you

all of this was perfectly legally

handled there were no charges pressed

and and if it does come back it probably

won't be for like another two seasons as

always so ever get time to talk about

anything no that's why we're so messed

up we we did once around another fire at

one time with a turtle man mm-hmm

I think he's dead I liked him well

speaking of taking care of Simon the

kids they want to stay here would it

make you feel better if we looked into

their family history and found out if

there's anything they've left behind or

or anyone we should notify I think we

should only look into their families if

they want us to because maybe that's

something they want to be have left

behind that we can understand right

we're already partway there if we found

squigglies mom

you you you did stop it's a good bit

you didn't pay that you you wanted to

let the children choose their family yes

yeah we have to let them choose it's

they could have come from someplace

worse that was way worse than they had

to dig bodies up or something terrible

you did choose your own grandmother I

did choose my grandmother even though

she wasn't sort of maybe than neutral I

don't know arts or naval and no he's not

good to get confirmation on that but he

seems to have chosen you as his mother

no but that's but can I just be your

crazy witch aunt I think we can probably

make that work you think mom are you mad

at me no nephew I am NOT my name is

Quigley

what's a nephew there's and play kids

you're my mom why don't you know my name

take waffles with you alright go play

with waffles Quigley preferably on the

street it's a girl playing with the gun

some more he takes it out like how do

you keep getting down it if the kids

will run upstairs and waffles will trot

behind I mean here and kind of like

chasing each other around and rough

Simon can you go watch over them Simon

is the responsible one uh-huh

he is technically like 80 some years old

as you say Simon will you take care of

them yulik see you and in the mouth like

opens like that's right I I don't know

you very well easily there's been a lot

of exposition I I feel like I know you

more than anyone else at this point

mmm and I gotta be honest with you you

guys need a sense of responsibility I'm

not really telling you what to do but

you guys need to learn to take care of

things excuse me

the problem is that we need to learn to

take care of ourselves and yeah that

might be a good outcome of learning how

to take care of these children I'd like

to think we're responsible we are

technically sort of parents we are

running a business we are and it's going

pretty well now that we learned about

profits how much do I owe you so over

the till and started like doing some

math on paper it's a box so you just are

you pretending it's a tool yes yes it

looks more important than actually as we

have a roof over our heads most of the

time it technically was given to us by

an another we pay rent are they alive

yes okay you're doing great at this

period of time okay well there are a lot

of good things a lot of things you can

work on it does sound like these

children care a lot about you and you

might actually need them you know I

don't I don't think necessarily that we

do a bad job taking care of ourselves I

mean just not a good job look I think

that if everyone just tries to take care

of others themselves yes well that is

taking care of myself because that's

what I want to do but what have you ever

like just been like hey I get up in the

morning I'm evylyn I'm gonna yell real

loud even though strix is still asleep

and talk about listener and she's trying

do you ever just say today I'm going to

do something I want to do instead of try

and keep everyone from dying the last

time yet a you day cuz I've never done

that I get up and panic every day well

what would you rather do not panic well

how can we help you stop panicking

I'll take care of you know what I mean

founded out see that's the problem she

yes how do you stop panicking Paul and

just kind of slides over someone you did

you did seem to slow down on the

drinking for a while but you've had more

wide than I thought we had in the cellar

recently are you okay

huh why were there barnacles on one of

the casks oddly specific question also

yes I found them oh my god that's not

alive shoot

well that's nice yeah it is nice

barnacles Albee comes out of the kitchen

part of hims on fire

and he's like apparently the pies are

done that's it that's his alarm is okay

so I'll run up to me like oh no helping

it oh it's okay I'll put him out and if

you go get the rest of the pies they're

done I'm gonna go get them none of them

are going to have parts of that little B

little beast in them I promise okay when

I go into the kitchen Deus brings it up

as he'll tell you the total is if you

got the Dragons 425 for dragons 25 nib

sorry okay friends these are a rumor to

be the best pies in town I'm going to

give you 40 dragons that's four months

rent

ma'am he said four dragons and 25 I do

not actually say that you should learn

the value of a good reputation oh and I

really do hope these pies you could

write your are you bringing them back to

someone I am oh well my one of my bands

I'm a band manager is returning to town

at the yawning portal I called sirens

sirens of the realms to be heard of them

called what now

sirens oh my god no one ever heard of

them

the sirens sisters do they do you ever

tour we do we're planning Paul tunes

next door you guys should play with each

other I don't think we should do that

they're very lovely but they've been

gone for a very long time Oh shame

they're going to love these pies and I

hope that one day we can hear them play

music yes and if you do just let me know

I will be sure to totally be there not

that it matters

thank you Joe yes yes they play the

yawning portal I think in the week they

play the yawning portal

hmm you should play the yachting portal

many others are there there's about five

six they kind of just kind of move on

musicians I'm not hanging out with

musicians I've never heard of these

needless generosity and we do hope they

enjoy the pies and if they do feel free

to come back for more where we will give

you standard rates we don't need to give

us this much every time well you all

anything but I appreciate your time and

your adventures and I am a bard as well

you have to say it like this every time

yes there are many schools at the Bartok

college schools of Bart's at the

colleges even know what I'm saying yes

and there are many kinds of bards what

kind of barter you that's a great

question

path I am out of clever ways to say I'm

not entirely sure fantastic

which is very different from a party

that's what I said party know it she

said party party party that's what I

said not party party parties are much

fancier am i right

right it's yeah cool that's what a fit

yes we go I'm sorry I didn't mean to

invite myself you are more than one yes

evylyn if you would enjoy that you

should go yeah use you know for you it

is you thing you like parties I don't

like parties that's okay we hate parties

and the parties sometimes you look

palton is the life of the party or death

depends on the day right Tuesday's

typically or when death happens for us

is this party on a Tuesday no I don't

think it's Tuesday it is on a Tuesday

no no but is it between 4 & 6 p.m.

Pacific

oh yeah that's very specific

yeah we should be fine it'll be safe

after yeah nothing bad happens after

that I think yeah yeah you can't pretty

episode there's like a beauty I have

heard that or have I I don't know that's

a big win

[Applause]

even my same very pleased to meet you

Terry nice to meet you no I'm strict

space finger okay bee sting uh hard that

again we made a deal with thousand Diaz

who made me a bee stinger so that I

would another evil family there's

probably coming back anyway there's a

lot of like universe ending thing there

was a thing with the multiverse and they

have a totally platonic but close

relationship and I was maybe gonna end

the multiverse but then we fixed it and

she got adopted yeah it's on it's on the

vod's if you want to see them

oh-ho interests me I've met a couple bee

stingers I mean one of them was me and

come fantastic well you're welcome if

you choose to fantastic if not I hope to

see you again sometime and she goes and

opens the door and snaps her fingers and

a very ornate gilded carriage and

there's a gentleman he's eating an apple

and he turns and he tips his hat how am

I gonna get all these pies and she just

are they in boxes like what oh no

they're all boxed up and the the has a

little chicken foot coven logo on top of

the box the branding is excellent he's

been learning she's been learning about

branding so they're all very nice boxed

up a little like kind of like green like

like ribbons like grody ribbons but they

look nice or tight well and each of them

has little handles on them so you can

carry them easily she's more of an

artist than a businessperson you know

the the the profit we're learning but

the branding is excellent this is good

you want to include the boxes the art

and all of that into the fee for the pie

oh that's good business I do it drew a

dragon on the bottom one for you oh

thank you

it's like mauling someone you know so

much about everything can you teach us

something else before you leave do you

know anything about love about love I

can teach you a little thing about love

the funny thing about love is you don't

know when it's gonna happen to you oh it

could happen at anytime anywhere

especially when you least expect it wait

but this sounds like the world is an

unsafe place

the world is both an unsafe place and an

amazing place I don't know why that go

all yru face touching

I do not judge but yes so keep your eyes

peeled you never know what is gonna

happen that's that's scary little scary

because what if what if it dies what if

it already is but you've experienced it

no I haven't

well sometimes love isn't for everyone

[Laughter]

maybe your friends will help you Viji

she hops up kind of curls around the

shoulders a little tail it was a

pleasure to meet you thank you for

coming by tell your friends absolute

line there is a sign outside it's a

little logo of a little chicken foot and

a broom and that just says between

scratchy barely legible writing says

chicken foot cuff in pies cool it was

lovely to meet you I really hope well

actually

what have you decided I mean I can't

leave without knowing you I mean I think

we decided that the kids are going to

stay but like you said they do need to

be properly taken care of which means

much more than is letting them live here

we need to they are their own room

that's not the panic room yes they can

each somehow maybe get their own room

house rules would be good let's make

them right now will you help us make

house rule absolutely before you leave

okay first rule no playing with guns no

guns your point you that you're really

gonna need to put that somewhere they

can't fire training animals is you have

to learn how to sock well I'd lock it

away but I think this guy knows keys

better than I do so maybe he should put

it away oh yeah if you lock it they're

never gonna give him there can we get

rid of it I don't like having weapons

that I don't know how to use and well

we're late no guns we don't let them

play with tricks of staff no there no

one gets me that's mine yeah and if jinx

is going to practice magic you're going

to have to instruct him the best he can

or at least please though he doesn't

call me Mom

Jynx vault good no weapons or magic use

by children except under supervision

honestly we probably shouldn't have any

destructive magic in the house at all

we've blown up the house too many times

and do you've got mad at me for covering

up evidence but what if there's a bad

guy if there's an only if there's a bad

guy how do we define bad guy I literally

live a three destructive magic users

yeah I do believe that actually

instructing them they're going to get

older is that how that I'm going to go

yes they're going to get older and these

skills as you've learned are beneficial

especially in a place like Waterdeep

that's true I'll teach that man if that

little kid keeps licking my stuff I will

punt him into the Sun why don't you

teach him to play in Encino man

sounds hard make them maybe make it the

drums that's a great idea I look I think

Sidley is more interested in weapons

than he is in music so I can I want to

play drums never mind I suppose not we

did it fallen and squiggly just smile

simultaneously and look at each other

not the first person to say that

it's grabs tricks and staff and starts

like that's my night take it away from

him angrily I'll teach you now how to

use daggers and I think they can

actually probably use their own kind of

leadership you know that way someday

when they don't need us they can just

lead each other like we need each other

right every time a family sure uh-huh

uh you're gonna want to teach them a

little respect for you guys in your

stuff Oh see that's the hard part

yeah how do we do that well if you like

that respects me maybe you talk to them

a little bit give them some consequences

learn teach them discipline I I'm not to

tell you how to do that um you'll learn

about that as you get to know them

getting to know them will help to think

I think they know respect I think they

respect us until it all right squiggly

shut up yes

take it easy away from you often that's

not very respectful matching magic items

that are very dangerous also and

unsanitary mmm incredibly you yeah

touching the body stick mmm-hmm

they might get some diseases I mean I

never have I can cure them it's fine

continue to look after their health yes

and feed them and feed them more than

pies they need proteins vegetables

you're growing children the pies have

all died up pies with meats in them and

vegetables and everything just comes in

pie form oh okay yeah you need at least

90% carbs a day that's how it works

it keeps you strong in Fantasyland it

sure is how it works

but we're not there where this is the

real world this is the real world that's

what I meant the point is we'll continue

to look after them because let's be

honest here they've chosen us and we

have to accept that responsibility and

we can keep them safe you know to the

best of our ability that's right now

let's go find your murder ex yeah let's

do that
