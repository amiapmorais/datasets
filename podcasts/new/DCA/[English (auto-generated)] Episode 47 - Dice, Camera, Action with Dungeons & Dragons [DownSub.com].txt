[Music]

[Music]

you

[Applause]

you

[Music]

everybody and welcome to dice camera

action come on

we've been in the same initiative count

for four weeks

I actually I just rebound my character

she no good and I was trying to figure

out I think I have four out of 73 HP is

that that sound right to you Chris we're

currently unconscious oh right it's a

good trouble I thought that did a friend

of mine who was like a no idea it's like

so we've been same initiative role for

like four weeks now as a normal boy

Jesus kind of like it's normal for us

yeah that's what happens when eight

encounters right any anyone remember the

amber temple anyone remember that cuz I

do I don't I was mostly unconscious

right I just want that armor back so

much to ask

it's all because I think this is still a

South motion it's yeah yeah yeah so

previously indice camera action the

heroes were sent to the fire giant forge

of iron slag to find out what the Giants

are doing there and um they beat up some

yak folk they lost a couple friends

evylyn claimed a suit of armor that was

left behind by a dwarf named crack that

armor was then taken from her and now

lies 10 feet away from her on the floor

of a giant foundry air armor that was

left where fire Giants um we're in the

process of building a huge Colossus and

the waffle crew animals knocked the

Colossus over and scented crumbling down

onto the floor which put the whole place

on edge and when we last left the party

they were throwing down with the fire

Giants in the assembly hall

and always someone at one point um Strix

turned into a giant mammoth and then

zalto used this pulsating adamantine

heart on the end of a chain and a crane

like a wrecking ball and slammed that

into her and then his wife the Duchess

bashed him mastodon over the head with

her iron scepter and Strix went down and

then evil and went down and then paltin

is still alive

currently conscious with one hit point

because he had the wherewithal to take a

few steps back at one point is that

there's a crit on the death save my god

yes yes he rolled a natural 20 on his

death save and sprung back to

consciousness after the Duchess

threatened to beat him into a pulp and I

don't like that Duchess lady now she's

young and then DF realizing that his

party was in dire straits and needed to

take some sort of decisive action

basically ran up the Duchess to hold a

short sword to her neck threatening to

stab her mightily if things did not

suddenly turn to the waffle crews favor

I did cut off her fingers though did yes

knocked off two of the Duchess's fingers

which I have to say is putting a little

crimp in the negotiations

besides that uh most of the other fire

Giants are currently preoccupied with

holding at bay the iron golem

that they have no control over presently

and is currently slicing and dicing them

slowly to pieces

and I can't remember the exact words you

uttered DF o is like whatever perfect

words were needed it's what I said

oh right with your 10 and that was that

was buttressed by a mighty roll all

right ah time to cry time to cry mm-hmm

so Sam

I missed by a mighty roll welcome to the

game and hello uh so you're playing a

character named cozen oh and you and

your companions hmm have arrived at iron

slag under nightfall oh and when you

reach the bottom of Mountain you're

looking for stairs carved into the

mountainside leading up and not too far

from the base of those stairs in the

lying in the snow which is now falling

from the night sky right you can see

what appears to be the half frozen

carcass of a three-headed monster with

matte like wings a leonian body it's

three heads those of a lion a goat and a

dragon and you and your companions kind

of marvel at this for a moment

and then find the staircase leading up

and the stairs become quite icy but you

don't have any real trouble navigating

them I'm gonna get to the top of the

stairs I'm sorry did the chimera die by

falling down the stairs it looked like

it fell from a great height but you also

see evidence of it being in a fight oh

okay and it's missing a horn yes and it

does look somewhat mutilated oh well in

that case now I'm sure as you and your

companions make your way up to the top

of the stairs you come to the Yak folk

village which is perched on a shelf on

the mountain side and you see evidence

of more carnage yak folk bodies lying

everywhere um yeah it's it's just

horrendous there all you hear is the

sound of a gushing waterfall pouring

down the mountainside

as you look around at the carcasses

it's it's very clear that this battle

whatever killed the Chimera obviously

made its way up here and continued its

dirty

you also notice the four of you that

there is a big bird circling it's in the

in the night sky over the Yak folk

village here it's wing flaps

with the sound of the blowing and and

Mira hmm

without a word pulls out her hand

crossbow and gives you a sign and your

friends assigned to do the same thing

all right draw my hand crossbow okay um

you and your companions all fire shots

up at the bird make an attack roll for

me 13 okay

tell us are you doing all right um rola

roll damage for your hand crossbow oh

yeah

five okay he had it coming all right

yeah you're shot and one other shot hits

it and you can see the bird obviously

sort of startled and wounded by this and

then it is not killed instantly and

starts to Ohio's your shot and one other

shot and then you start to see that the

poison on the bolts starts to take hold

and it's sort of flounders a bit and

then plunges from the sky missing the

village and just falling down the

mountainside well it couldn't be helped

when you make your way through the set

of iron doors you see the elevator shaft

has been crippled they've someone has

destroyed the raising and lowering

mechanism and so the platform is not

coming up as told it would at that point

in time you and your companions use your

levitate ability to sink down the shaft

safely oh and when you you pass by what

appears to be the elevator platform

which is just sort of suspended at a

height about 4/5 of the way down the

shaft not going anywhere and easily move

past it to land at the bottom of the

shaft

and that's when you begin to hear sounds

of battle mmm and our birds in there as

well you hear no birds alright well if

there are gonna mess them up you make

your way through darkened wide giant

sized passageways even sort of skirting

around the edge of what appears to be

some sort of large dining hall entering

another wide hallway which has an

overturned brazier lying on the floor as

well as a number of other braziers in

niches along the walls all to

giant-scale and as you make your way

around you come to a corner and as you

and your companions step around the

corner see a battle being joined looks

like a number of a fire giants engaged

with some sort of black iron automaton

and

at the same time shouting over that a

voice calling for sort of a cease and

desist all right and you also see a

figure in the entrance before the room

standing with his back to you

paltin I'd like you to make a perception

check for me okay

sixteen okay and Sam I'd like you on

behalf of your companions to make a

stealth check for all right no God 19

okay uh six pretty you're pretty sure

that you are not heard or sign by the

figure good okay idea yes uh the Duchess

uh sort of uh she's got she's looking

over toward you angrily you can see her

hair is all now unkempt in a disarray

her bright orange hair and she says the

odds are not in your favor and then I

see her husband up on the gantry just

laugh throw his head back and laughter

at you not intimidated in the least by

your desperate Minh the sword still at

her throat with whatever glare that

eosin gave me leaving in just did like a

really angry eyebrows during yet totally

matches one large eye coming from her uh

uh

he says you stand upon your last legs

and I stand upon you oh do you wish your

grey guard to say get this great Duchess

the fire Giants fell to man ha

all right uh and we last left on your

initiative yeah yep

did you want to do or can you do

anything you use the action to move and

Breton right you're not gonna actually

attack her Are you ill if she does

something I mean yeah it's what are the

conditions by which you might stab her

um if they try to say attack me at all

or swing at me if they make any kind of

movement or actions to any one of my

allies okay or the moment that des

realizes the hopelessness of the

situation and basically sets up myself

sets aside his own life to make sure

that the very least Weber Benjen C can

get can can be obtained okay

um I'd like you to make a perception

check form yeah great I'm good at ease

21:22

okay you're trying to you know maintain

awareness of the combat surroundings you

can see palton standing off into a

doorway looking quite hurt and battered

but alive probably a little terrified

maybe a touch drunk um you see uh your

two friends

evylyn and Strix lying on the ground um

I can't remember I didn't write this

down were they stable remember Holly I

think we were totally stable I

definitely don't think that we were safe

oh I think I remember you know okay I

think you I think

evylyn might have been staple item II

don't remember actually I think you had

just fallen so we hadn't even rolled a

deaf save for any of you yet yeah I

don't think I don't think we've rolled

any Dessay yet uh so what you do notice

with your rolled yet is waffles kind of

goes bounding away not toward the battle

but kind of down the hallway past paltin

yes maybe one of us can lose

yes and that's because um posing you see

varus has sort of gone down to one knee

and is coaxing Richard Porter oh well

that can't be good

uhh

does a great see me uh no one sees any

of hmm the only the only creature that

seems to have any inkling that you're

there is the baby owl bear currently

galumphing direction this super cute and

adorable and has never done anything to

it yeah you definitely shouldn't draw

point of it is it it's it's a meaty

little air pal bear right yes it is and

there's I don't like you saying me

there's there's nothing to indicate that

Gareth is threatening it in any way I

will observe okay for the moment all

right so the f you see waffles go

bounding out of sight okay and next up

in the initiative is Strix so Strix I

need a deaf save here comes natural

twenty uh nope I got three okay one

failure no hey uh the other fire Giants

will go um rim scarda the Duchess uh she

says call off your golem and we'll talk

about it call it off for this

negotiation is over uh the other fire

Giants are bashing away at it and at

cracks or if elemental alright okay okay

um does the Duchess said this yes I hate

that lady do I believe her

hmm well did you make an inside check

[Applause]

the answers yes I believe okay six okay

uh what what basically she's a little

inscrutable to you at the moment yeah

okay

in response uh I'll say release her

weapons first and stand down and we

shall do the same all right

you blend that's a please Oh Xander

bless me 800 K one failure at least Rex

and I die together

ha yeah it's possible that like one of

your arms just sort of fought fell over

Strix yeah and then Strix just sort of

threw it off just sex is like I won't

die together I can't take a character

death this week Chris okay you gotta

like tell the dice gods or whatever

alright uh the Duke sort of casts his

eyes up at his children who are one of

on one of the other gantry's looking

down to see how he reacts to this

current situation and you can see he

kind of locks the chain of the crane um

and kind of reaches out and stops the

heart from swinging at the moment and

while sort of hanging off the gantry a

little ace leaps down to the landing

about ten feet away from his mall which

is sort of standing on its head and

about ten feet away from you yeah and

the Duchess mm-hmm and he comes to his

full height

up about 24 feet looks you square in the

eye and says

you have attacked my home come in here

uninvited and try to lay waste to my

work why I told you our animals were

lost you expect me to believe that who

are you working for did you not see the

Oliver owl there look big wide eyes

innocent face very young he says I do

not I do not I do not follow anyone

else's it's fine uh he says you will

stand down now or I will eat you into

submission and make you my slave what

you think I've got anything else to lose

at this point

he says as he tightens his grip on the

handle of them all yes I believe you

strange as I believe you do as well it's

at the pointy end of my sword we both

know she's got doesn't have much left in

her this single swipe he says oh you

don't know my wife

she is no frail thing and she will not

be felled by that try me

he says admitted you are dwarven spies

we're just bad pet owners man uh he says

you tried to rescue one of them he

didn't make it

why was it Citadel fell bar Citadel ad

bar Sunday bar could be a hundred

percent honest with you I don't even

know who that dwarf was was I wasn't

trying to save them for the record don't

notice what well this is going on uh

yeah if your turn has come around again

okay uh talking about six seconds now

waffles now sort of it's uh comes right

up to Viren Colson and she just sort of

pets it hmm and seems to be very kind to

it okay um and she sort of picks it up

in her pants Gareth is perhaps a little

distracted right now yes probably not

watching me then currently at the moment

uh and these guys are all within range

of my darkness spell right uh all of the

drow are close to you

well not the drow but these uh these

strange little pink creatures I found oh

yeah yeah they're all within range

so feasibly if I were to cast darkness

spell on this little exchange it might

give them some time to escape it would

it would almost certainly be you

wouldn't it would be very clear to your

companions that you had cast the spell

yeah but I mean if we do that I mean

higher Giants believing that there's

more trouble for them is not bad for us

I believe that that is that so

DF yeah um is there anything you'd like

to do on your turn um so I'll respond to

his question about being spies and

working for certain people he had

mentioned a few other Citadel's what

were those names again Citadel fell bar

and Sunda bar felt bar and send the bar

yeah I'm sure right quick okay um at

that point one of his son shouts down

maybe they're from mithril Hall asked

him if it from mithril Hall uh his

father to see respond by saying spies no

we were in colleagues with the dwarves

of Citadel Santa bar yes but only with a

simple goal

you were sent out to come and slay harsh

nag the giant which if you'll actually

look outside you'll find that we did

from there things got out of hand

admittedly you killed harsh nak I can

show you the body Kosan I

I'm uh you know calm call me crazy but I

don't really have a lot of faith in

drapes bluffing abilities Here I am

going to try to cast darkness okay on

this whole general scene okay uh so you

cast the spell

suddenly DF you and everyone around you

and paltin to are suddenly caught in

impenetrable blackness you can't see

anyone else around you I have time to

shout something yes that's a free action

basically in my crudest impression of a

dwarf accent I showed basically the jig

is up lads over here with the intention

that they will at least be able to

follow the sound of my voice

alright when you do that your fellow

drow I'll turn toward you incredulously

and yeah to which point I explained if

the fire Giants think there are dwarven

spies they have one more distraction

that strengthens our negotiating

position and then I wink just all always

works like a deception role for me

yay what sorry got six beerus looks at

you drops the albear on the floor and

says I just meant that if the fire

Giants assume there are dwarven spies

going on here they will be more inclined

to use our little product to wage war on

the dwarves rather than leaping rather

than going back on their word and going

straight after dragons

she says our only task here was to

deliver the flask that is all we were

asked to do this ball the demon queen

commands on us there's no reason we

can't sweeten the deal a little wouldn't

it be better to come back as instigators

of a war rather than simple errand boys

and girls she seemed generally

flabbergasted having not thought this

through at all and she just she just

turns back to the darkness and turns to

you this suit Allah it's good ruin

everything

um and she tightens her grip on flask

tied around her belt actually she

removes it from her belt at this point

as the darkness springs up in the room

there are shouts of chaos from all of

the fire Giants d/f suddenly the Duchess

is clearly moving around and uh so I

know like I'm suddenly surrounded by

darkness and I heard this scream not

even sure what's really happy yeah it

sounded like a dwarf cast of darkness

that's weird that is rude

um so I love darkness so the moment so

the moment that happens a tree is going

on ah so I'm still on top of the fire

giant went to take my short sword this

slash across her throat and then he to

both my feet like back spring off of her

okay juh land on the ground in two then

to get over to worse tricks and evil

Enlai okay make an attack roll with this

advantage because your current she is

currently invisible to you she's right

it's true

Oh too bad uh with disadvantage 19 okay

you hit her great you have sneak attack

because hey she can't see you

oh no oh you up I'm really

glad you didn't miss the giant right in

front of you thank you just you know

just in retrospect 24 oh okay she

screams out and then you spring off of

her yes okay

heading in the direction of the shouting

voice towards worse tricks and evil in

life okay uh paltin what would you liked

it so all this is happening at once yes

so what like mrs. cast weird dwarf shout

and and out like death yeah

what is happening all right now do you

want to do anything else

oh okay I'm gonna go toward boon well

I'm not gonna announce it actually yeah

like never mind it I'm going to go

toward the UH toward this dwarf okay

when you take a few paces in that

direction you suddenly emerge from the

darkness a torch lit giant sized hallway

wherein you see four elves with charcoal

colored skin and stark white hair one of

them two of them are physically bigger

than the other two but they're all kind

of slender androgynous figures and one

of them is dressed more like a wizard

with these sort of web-like

robes and the others addressed black

leather arm or breastplates

and spider motifs work into them you can

see that their eyes have some red pupils

and there is spidery demonic menace to

them it is not what you were expecting

to see at all

you can also see awful - far away from

them I step out of the darkness just

like oh good more at Lourdes this is

just how we dress ma'am yes ah but they

look like they look like your brief

companion wrist who you met in the

wilderness darker or boating you can see

that II there's email who has long white

hair in a ponytail has a iron flask in

one hand which you can relate to on some

level and it is sort of got her finger

sort of pointing into the chest of a one

of her peers who has a pale grey spider

tattoo covering his dark face she lasts

forever man and as you come stumbling

out all the drow just sort of turn and

look at you you want to do anything ever

technically use in action and not can I

use a free action and give them another

one of those award-winning winks yeah

the the the drow with the spider face

tattoo gives you a curious loving wink

oh yeah I didn't I didn't say love

knowing a knowing wink knowing yes yes

thank you

yeah clearly though not dwarves well

it's like what did I already miss

something

[Laughter]

that's that I just I don't know what to

make of anything just you know be cool

see that be the drow equivalent of cool

we're working on something uh how many

of your friends did you leave back there

ah friends oh sure comes out green I

think like a the small litter of the

animals

yeah don't know dot I don't care uh

about animals that's fair all right um

yeah three three all right

you think uh maybe you could go back and

get one thank you

I tried darkness um like what you

remember with were right yeah come with

it is advanced darkness okay it's it's

it's fine all right we don't we don't we

don't mean all right I have a track

record for listening to strangers so in

I go just we're back into the darkness

it's that wing all right so now you sort

of blindly are in the darkness probably

not far from where you were when you

started

is there any anything else you would

like to do because you know both evil

intense tricks are were lying on the

floor not too far away from you bleeding

out

can I can I try and would it be for me

to navigate back to where they were yeah

you could navigate back to where they

were and sort of deal around there there

okay

they am i aware if they're conscious or

none um the well they're clearly not

conscious they're lying on the floor and

whether they're alive or not you're not

too sure about but you could try to

stabilize one

hard to do in darkness I'm going to say

that your medicine check would have

disadvantage lesson was to just drag

their bottle well that could work as

well you could grab both of them if you

wanted to since neither of them are

particularly heavy at the moment and

pull them somewhere let's do that okay

I'd pull up the where I met these new

friend OHS okay so you go back into the

darkness after leaving it you grab your

two unconscious friends and you drag

them out of the darkness back toward the

drow see how where my of Paulton doing

this not at all

[Laughter]

all right so palton you do and when you

do the female drow the flask says

offense and Lisa it's like yeah this is

a normal thing yeah so called friends

all right um now Strix you have another

death saved coming Kol out of 15 okay

yay all right uh feareth will pull out

her hand crossbow um she hands the

actually first thing she does is she

hands the flask to Jos fighter buddy's

why not me why not indeed just because I

caused a problem suddenly I can't be

trusted with a flask

not the first problem is already yeah

all right uh and then she'll pull out

her hand cross bow and shoot paltin she

rolls an 18 on the die Sharon's face

Alden

she does a whopping 3 points of damage

which is enough to put God and you just

sort of fall on top of evil and strix oh

great

back under I go all right we're just a

pile of bodies at this point can we

please be on fire oh yeah they're fire

dancer on sauce just think possibly it's

also possible you know you just might

spontaneously combust when you die

stress

evylyn you got a death safe coming

please it's fine everything's fine

please wake up

seven hey look that's two no all right

um with the golem now fighting the

Giants in darkness and more chaos

ensuing zalto hearing the cries of his

wife realizing she has been stabbed well

that seems to at least give you at least

a moment DF do something without being

bashed on the noggin what would you like

to do in the darkness cry ah obviously

there's no way for me to see it but uh

did I hear anything like palton died

here pelton getting Strix in Eveland and

some sort of candy getting shot and

plopping to the ground I would say under

normal circumstances you probably could

have but the sounds of the fire Giants

and the golem and everything else going

on in here

the guy can we chambers seem highly

unlikely that the driving of your

friends we call not on my way down

oh my body now I will allow that so you

could probably hear palt over the din

you could hear paltin say hello my body

[Laughter]

and it seemed to come from roughly the

point he was standing at before the

darkness okay

[Laughter]

all right um so cutting action - I will

make my way to where I thought I saw

worse tricks and eland work yeah and you

find that they're not there anymore

right

uh and just in that confusion yeah with

the rest of my movement head towards

where Paulding was maybe I was mistaken

or okay use uh cuz I think you're sort

of you kind of blunder in that direction

eventually emerge from the edge of the

darkness fear where you're suddenly the

light is normal and in the torchlight

you can see paltin lying with a small

sort of dart sized crossbow bolt in his

shoulder and on top of Strix and evil

and evil it looks in really bad shape

you also see for drow about twenty feet

away and waffles close by alright not an

imminent danger right at least

everyone's accounted for

okay all you've done is all you've done

is right um probably a total out uh so

immediately confused as just the fact

that Bolton was shut down by them yeah

that's not warm see that much right uh I

guess just really quickly I'll like

speak at the entire do you have the drop

party just what's going on

uh gesture to evil in and strikes and

paltin because they are all not doing

too great here right I will say we could

talk about it or we could save your

friends

up to you um yeah look look it back down

at them and just back at the party and

this I'll just say guess anything let me

help them alright

we uh kannaiah then me to just go into a

quick stabilize of Eveland while looking

the worse yeah you can make a medicine

check on evylyn all right right away

listen uh 13 okay she you stabilizer yes

good there we go

she can we draw aren't all bad guys okay

alright still very much making a mental

note of the fact that there is a

crossbow bolt inside of Fulton yeah see

mutant yeah hysterical he was raving

weed to sister we we had to tranq him

just uh yes of chosen you're up uh the

Giants all seemed to be still pretty

bothered by their queen their Duchess

getting slashed up right you would

assume so based on the sounds you're

hearing Oh evil and while you're out of

the room

you have stabilized you know no my watch

all right I will

ask uh my two thugs not beerus uh to

grab two of the other of the unconscious

ones and ask DF to grab one as well and

then i want to i want to suggest that we

all bolt out of there

yep um Bharath overrules

and says stay well you i'll crossbows

out I say in another second the fire

Giants are going to realize that

darkness was just cast all over them if

we leave now we can maybe convince them

it was someone else that did it but if

they see a bunch of droughts here

they're going to put two and two

together here it says we have on that

side right but case your fault I

wasn't forgetting I was just thinking

ahead not words I wanted to hear in case

you know if they assume dwarves did it

we can count on their insured loyalty to

our cause if they assume we did it maybe

not

we might be on their side but I don't

think they're going to want to talk once

there they find their Dutchess bleeding

and darkness all over the place and drow

just lurking around you are conspiring

against me you're trying to make me fail

my test of law I see that now I I make

you know see it does not become you I

make the best groveling position I can

okay without giving her a chance to stab

me okay ah and I say I am only thinking

of your ensured success deliver the

flask you merely pass you'll be killed

by another matriarch within a day

instigate the War Between the fire

Giants and the dwarves you'll return a

hero not only will you pass you'll be

elevated above everyone else and as your

fortunes rise so do all of ours and our

houses make a persuasion check hey I'm

so glad I'm unconscious through this so

I don't panic that was a nine okay add

in a little wink

oh those dice those wacky dice oh come

alright the other the other fire Giants

are still um thrown for a loop in the

darkness it's very clear though da that

Duchess Prince Garda is still alive

David hopes he bleeds to death that you

can hear her screaming at her husband to

find these vermin and smash them into

pulp he seems more than happy to but at

the moment The Golem in the command room

halten you've got a death save coming

neat

roll a d20

add nothing to it cool here comes third

natural 20 mmm 13 is a success one

success Strix you've got no save no one

stabilized me

I collect return Strix I'm on fire and

sleep okay 15 again alright two

processes close to stabilizing on your

own oh jeez

it is the other drow Stearns veera

forever stubborn and not as enlightened

as like her to be chosen automatically

following orders given to her by her

Spider Queen goddess ignores you blows

you off entirely and orders you and the

other three droughts to open fire oh

yeah ah orders are orders buddy

no I'm kidding I really like to imagine

you just started crying in here yeah

yeah if you see like three of the drow

level of their mira three loads hers and

the other two level layers at you the

one who was pleading for another plan um

well he's technically already use this

action so he's be counted here but okay

so I just I try hard every day uh uh so

one of them are old one world 212 which

is not enough to hit that was Varys she

missed you another one rolled a

seventeen uh that is just enough okay so

when that one hits you it does a

whopping five piercing damage look kitty

Dodge you take two men yes and I need

you to make a constitution saving throw

as it is poisoned course it is so on a

constitution saving thrill I add my

dexterity right

what great

uh the stone of good luck works on

signatures yeah yeah

okay so I got a plus 117 okay

you succeeded on that saving throw and

don't suffer any other ill effects Oh

the final crossbow bolt uh will also hit

you it does another five piercing damage

okay

and I need you to make a second save the

first time I've taken damage in this

entire damn fire giant place nineteen

all right

yes you repel the effects of the drought

poison and are still standing at the end

yeah I've got a lot of adrenaline going

right now yep

okay handedly saving the party a little

hassle and then evil in your stable so

nothing happened in there salt oh is you

hear him bellow orders to hold off the

construct as much as possible and then

he comes stomping out of the darkness

and appears in the hallway right next to

UDF ah good with his big mall over his

head and he sort of kind of blunders out

like he probably ran into a wall or a

door before getting there so he's a

little bit discombobulated disoriented

when he emerges and sorry he takes stock

of everything he sees around him

immediately sees the Dark Elves and for

an instant is surprised humiliated angry

annoyed there seems to be a whole flood

of emotions over him as soon as he lays

eyes on the drow great maybe we can make

one of those emotions Dead is dead in

emotion it's the last emotion Dead is

the last emotion

uh and then he says darling

the drower here we didn't even set the

table oh and then through a sort of

sounds of gushing blood you hear say

they're early I'm such a mess China yes

and ignoring you completely DF

absolutely ignoring it he takes a few

more paces forward which means he

actually provokes from you should you

wish to stab him do you wish to say oh

oh I desired you very much but shucks da

no fool haha uh yeah but rather see how

this plays out since he seems to have

been anticipating these four droughts

who are mostly diffs the Duke says to

the Dark Elves chosen included we have a

security breach but things are well in

hand you are quite safe give me what I

give me what I want

oh go away

give me the flask

umm I step forward and alright it is is

it my turn

Oh actually right now it is d Esther and

then your turn

okay rear and I you see the Duke is

angry and impatient uh but yes he he

wants the flask okay so up temporarily

ignoring all of that I could get a quick

scan of my friends how we looking ah

well let's see palton is one

stablization check success Strix has to

so I'd say paltin looks a little bit

worse often Strix at the moment and I'm

still unconscious but stable correct

yeah all right um I guess I'll try to

get Fault in the quick stabilization

okay just good I don't know

what's happening anymore please try to

guarantee try to help make sure that

they'll get out of this uh oh that's

good it's nineteen you stable whoa you

sort of pull the little arrow out

there's a little spurt of blood and then

you just sort of patch it us real quick

um oh gosh okay so with that I'm gonna

take I'll take Halton and like try to

like make them into like a backpack to

me okay I flipped over on that uh-huh

I'll use one arm to uh kind of get evil

in kind of like half trigger and then

make my way over to Strix okay so you

got like evylyn and Strix in one arm

each and palton draped over you um your

trace is completely registering holding

all understand you're gonna burst a

blood-vessel yeah Couzens uh merrily

apparently that DF can just be you know

shot full of arrows and he just ignores

him and goes off picking up his friends

he'd he's something he's got to do what

he's got to do man

yeah uh yes enough he has enough poison

coursing through him to put down an

elephant but you know well in the most

distracting way I possibly can

I'm going to step forward and address

dukes Alto and I'd say we were under the

impression that there was going to be

that this was going to be a

run-of-the-mill transfer if you have a

security breach I don't know if we can

necessarily give the flasks to you at

this point without some assurance that

you'll be using it in the way we

upon I'm gonna resist the urge to wink

uh you can see the fire giant Duke

tightens his grip you hear the sort of

writing of his gauntlet says his fingers

wrapped tight around his weapon and his

brow furrows and he bares his yellow

teeth like this is a this is a figure

who does not is not accustomed to being

challenged particularly by one so small

this is this isn't a challenge this is

just us guaranteeing our investment we

brought our flask here we got this flask

for him under the impression that he

would be using it against our mutual

enemies and if he can't fail if he can

to perform that then perhaps can't

perform catch SiC impotency joke he says

I never break a commitment well that

might be true but you also committed to

us that your fortress was impregnable

and yet I practice wrote esque craig

nobility going on here and Gareth is

absolutely livid at this point it says

shut up you fool I you know I tell her

if we all die we all die together now if

you better get in on this she says the

fire primordial delivered as promised

I'll give in to him she gave it to me

right she gave it to Joss Joss what we

said that out loud sonic mommy

um palton is currently stable and

unconscious tricks you've got another

death saving throw

come on that plenties hello i got an 11

so okay you are stable yes one last

thing I said all right at this point in

time unless chosen since you haven't

technically acted yet I choose to

intervene

Jos who is carrying the iron flask will

make his way toward the fire giant uh I

attempt to subtly trip alright oh just

make an attack roll your companion uh

fourteen all right that does not succeed

in tripping Joss what the is choice

mate Oh evil yes he is chaste full of

evil that's bad sorry

so yes you tried to chip him a trip him

but all those many those 30 40 odd years

spent at the marshal Academy melee mag

fair has trained him to not fall for

what is essentially a schoolyard trap uh

[Laughter]

all right

can he tell I was the one that tried to

trip him uh yeah he's pretty damn sure

uh how close is grace to us I can't

blame it on him can I

addy at this CS right you can't you

can't blame it on DF because he's

literally got both arms he's got too low

and to guy a guy straight over his arms

and standing about ten feet away this

was a setup you invited me here thinking

we were all gonna have a good time

all right this is not looking good for

old cozen no um yeah this is your your

friends your unquote friends I do not

seem to be getting a good look scible

alright um in that case

I can be your buddy

you know what it's gonna have to come to

that I'm taking it very pretty much

suspects me of trying to undermine her

at this point right there is no doubt in

your mind yes all right weird we're

going for broke here I'm gonna

run for it

when you say run for it like just run

away from everybody run for it

no I'm gonna I guess I already took in

action I can't yeah I can't shoot Joss

right now can i no yeah you can

move all right I am going to start

moving okay towards DF okay um really

well hopefully they will be too busy yes

destroying everything to notice us okay

uh the other Dark Elves Joss won't do

anything other than complete his move

stand before Duke zalta with the iron

flask held up to him the iron flask

would looked like it would just be tiny

and oops all those hands uh but yes um

so he holds it up expecting the Duke to

take it on his turn meanwhile Veera

--the casts a spell on you chosen why so

I need you to make a dexterity saving

through okay as a 13 plus 3 of my decks

16 you say that is enough yes yes I say

she blasts you with a lightning bolt uh

but only catches you with part of it

nice so you take

you take 12 points of lightning damage

what the is happening here I just

go with it man yeah and then the other

drow Sabbath um he will wait um he will

leap at you with his poisoned short

sword and attack you twice Oh

his first attack role is going to hit

you with 22 second his second attack

role is also going to hit you with an 18

so you take a total of 17 points of

piercing and poison damage from the

first attack okay and then you take a

total of 15 additional points from the

second attack of 32 points of damage

total you are you're you're killing me

I am uh salto on his turn will do

nothing except advanced to take the

flask and when he looks at it he like

holds it up the tiny little flask

between his finger and his thumb he just

looks at it and he says I expected it to

be bigger and Veera says I assure you

being trapped in that flask is much much

bigger hmm

and he says honey darling love of my

life

we can now light the forge oh good yes

oh it was all worth it I hated these

guys but their love is super in slow man

all right yeah yes I have a very

important question yes at this point

you're almost being ignored both by the

drow and by zalto right salsals holding

this flask right yes how high up is that

um so if he's holding a kind of an eye

level that'd be about 24

feet oh it's eye level okay now he's

holding up so you can look at the little

boss on its surface so be a little

difficult to say someone - we put on

nowhere and snatch it but it would be

difficult impossible no go for it man

like I completely believe in you chairs

broken

you've done a man that's it he's gone

all right so I would need to body to

climb him to go for it right yeah Chris

Berg yeah do it slowly does it another

possibility is if you have a healing

potion or something you could give it to

somebody with like winged boots uh I did

she was knocked unconscious

[Laughter]

um so I'm not gonna climb up for it

because that's not gonna happen okay but

this is clearly something really

important to them sure would be a shame

if both parties lost it stupid okay

gently place my lights back down I'm

going to throw a dagger at the flask say

that he drops it okay no I'm gonna grab

it okay just make an attack rule is that

we were attacking him okay which dice

should I use which one don't trust none

none just none of them not on this

stream this is it this is what I got uh

sorry fam oh oh wait no just butt Rock

include attack rolls uh sorry

you're to hit I don't believe but let me

check um it did to do stone of good luck

ability checks and saving crumbs that's

it

okay so no alright then fifty all right

uh so you hurl a dagger up

it strikes do saltos hand gauntlet and

bounces off at which point he looks down

at you I play at the door drow what is

surly you but just like you know the

group just oh yeah lump us all in dude

that's alright Halton is unconscious

Strix is unconscious the drow go next D

cozen how would you like to do I'd like

to have not tried to persuade everyone

because I'd see that seems to have it

really losing strategy for me so you

know but I don't think counting my

regrets is gonna help okay much um are

they so they are paying attention to DF

right now yeah alright so I can old home

I could run you you've got more hit

points than me you'll be fine yep you

could try uh currently you are currently

in melee with one of your former

companions which SATA Sabbath I always

hated him

but ma'am uh you could do nothing except

disengage to get away from him I'll

provoke any hobbies

all right I'm going to disengage because

this is clearly no this is clearly not

working out for me right and are you

running kind of back the way you came or

I'm running often it in a new direction

I'm running towards these fallen guys

are they close

yes all right I'm gonna run towards

these farm go I'm gonna try to I'm gonna

try to at least salvage some of this

okay you can get to them there are three

of them lying there uh which one there's

there's a raggedy looking one teeth

laying with horns and black torn

moth-eaten garments and uh there's a

small little jariabek woman with winged

boots and okay curly white blond hair

not currently wearing any armor and then

there's a bard a slender human fella so

hypothetically if one of these guys were

to look up and see that I had saved them

and me dying and I gasped with my last

breath avenge me which one of them would

be most likely oh gee that's it that's

it that's a tough one um not this huh

you can't tell I'm just gonna grab the

one with the horns then and okay damn it

Georgians start dragging okay are you

dragging her into the darkness or are

you dragging her away

Oh nobody much you know just just trying

to get okay survive - got it right oh

all right

so da if you can see that drow with a

face tattoo drag Strix offs what the

hell it's fine it's fine

I give them the drow hand sign for it's

fine what is that like yeah what does

that look like okay since I didn't get

to use my movement my turn

can I use that to doubt grab the other -

sure and then I'll let you do that

all right uh and then you're trying to

be feet yeah this book it

okay so the two of you and you can see

the earth is like nah but the two of you

can see there are two ways to go that

aren't toward the darkness one is into

the kitchen back toward where the

cisterns are you also recalled seeing

some sort of staircase there leading

upstairs I maybe go and then the other

way is down a brazier lit hallway to a -

you Couzens to be the dining room at the

elevator shaft but we came down the

elevators we can't go back up it uh you

can cuz of you could if you had your

levitate spell I didn't because I used

it used it today

yeah so the elevator shaft is not the

best way to go alright viii you've been

you've been here before as a show good

sign we're a show of good faith where do

you think we should go kitchen kitchen

or dining room uh oh

we actually been into the dining room at

all during this whole uh you have not

okay so I I don't know where the dining

room itself connects to now I know the

kitchen connects to the you know the

kitchen connects to the cistern and then

the foundry but there's also a staircase

in the kitchen leading up to the upper

level which would take you back toward

the mines you yeah I'd be like which

these yeah go ahead the elevator shaft

doesn't work we'll have to go through

the mines which the mines are small

enough that fire drives can't fit in

there just fire lizards will stand a

better chance against them that we will

fire lizards ah yeah staircase is our

best bet

alright hopefully the the golem keeps

them busy long enough okay uh when you

burst into the kitchen the door is the

big giant doors of the kitchen are ajar

you can see that there are a number of

creatures here lying dead on the floor

I look like goblins and you can see

standing over there murdered remains

with and sort of clutching a log is

Jasper the dwarf you last saw him he had

fallen unconscious or killed back when

he was hammered by do

Ultimo in hallway shortly after evil and

rescued him and you can see he's panting

and puffing and he's got soot covering

him and he looks like he's just been in

a fight when he sees you barge into the

kitchen and you're carrying unconscious

folks the first thing he does is cast a

healing spell on on me on everybody yay

what a badass good call

um I run into this can I also give like

a little try to get waffles to follow

yes wahhh face will follow on around

good uh so everybody gets 18 hit points

Wow everybody everybody everybody

everybody 18 yep

I'm alive so the healing word that is

inert mass cure wounds oh I'm really

glad we saved Jesper alright so some of

you awakened suddenly feeling healing

magic wash over you to realize you're

being carried Strix you are doubly

alarmed because the figure uh pulling

you is a drought so like just like my

god out uh oh I'll drop her yeah

Oh quietly lamenting that perhaps I T

fling herself and outcast from society

should not be so harsh I don't I don't

say this I just give it in a look that

sort of suggests I'm not my harshest

weak possibly muster like I'm airing a

very disapproving weak she's just like

maybe it was the spider tattoo like I

don't know I don't want to hurt her

physically just emotionally all right so

as soon as like Jasper awakens everyone

and they're all a bunch of their feet I

don't imagine

little confused as to where they are and

what's happening uh like I'll be they

just command to everybody upstairs now

we're going back through the minds yeah

and then lead the way

all right Steve you got an idea - wait

Rick she's sick honey fireballs ah hold

on ah evil and immediately start singing

a hymn to Lysander pray in his holy my

Oh saving my hand tell about her lies

while she screaming ah aren't you glad

we're all awake again uh I don't think I

have any fireballs all right well then

don't worry about it risk in rigging ass

out of here sorry I need to leave all

right uh behind you you can so actually

before that happens um yeah you do still

hear there's a lot of chaos with the

fire Giants behind you but they're way

too close for comfort

palton you're actually next in the

nisshin order oh good hmm

so I just woke up and was told upstairs

yeah yeah you can see you're in this

giant kitchen kitchen sized for Giants

there's a bunch of dead goblins on the

floor and a giant sized staircase going

up each step is about two and a half

feet tall unless you got a got any other

tricks to help stave them off nope all

right you start to climb the difficult

terrain that is the staircase heading up

and Oh as we do the staircase I can

can't I have darkness for my tea fling

ability so I can leave some darkness

behind us in the staircase all right I

might just do that

and maybe also like I'm trying to think

oh I do have minor illusion I'll believe

it do you leave darkness within the

dining room that way they don't know ya

what direction we went I can do that

perfect okay are we all leaving or are

we still an initiative we're still love

initiative okay

yeah I just want to make it clear that

I'm not leaving without waffles waffles

is here you look around in a panic for

waffles I know there she is Oh baby girl

and I put her back in the harness which

I'm still wearing it was my god

or baby oh man where's juniper where's

where stinky okay everybody's here I'm

like holding I got stinky he's like all

right so you're gonna cast the darkness

spell toward the dining room so that

they think you've gone in that direction

am i hearing that right yes okay tell

nascar uh it's early it's all right yeah

yeah all right

um even though the drow saw you run the

other way wait wait wait so we're in the

dining room right now yeah you're in the

kingdom oh I'm sorry I misspoke then I

have to say that I said while I put the

darkest in the kitchen that way they

thing like we were trying to hide or

something was in the kitchen sure and

then but then Holly said we could okay

got it

yeah it's gonna go it's a kitchen yeah

doesn't even speaking uh sir

okay no worries like where do you want

this pushing the darkness over you want

to readjust to the left okay

no no two inches to the right that's

fine let's go you're gonna screw up

everything your darkness is crooked yeah

all right uh okay so what you drop it

here and then scuttle up the stairs

strix uh and then the drow go you can

hear out in the hallway a email drow

blurred blurting out we have to stop

them the dwarfs cannot know that we are

interfere this is between them and the

Giants and at that point in time now

that it's darkness she knows how

okay uh I did not prepare my dispel

magic

all right uh yes so you can hear

entering the darkness with you um the

drow

um and they can't have gotten far she is

going to your um that here the drought

we're gonna just bumble around the

darkness to see maybe they find you uh

not cool yeah I'm just gonna have a

misperception checks uh everybody who is

in the darkness which would be everybody

but Halton and Strix make a stealth

check form you've got it twenty oh nice

try it and evylyn you're not wearing

armor so you have no disadvantage on

stealth or anything it's just three but

I still rolled a three Chris Perkins

look evil a total of five all right so

uh band are love it looks down upon us

all uh one of the drow reckon grabs hold

of you I mean yeah and sort of does it

in a very unkind way sort of grab you by

the hair excuse me sir and says

something in L and under common to his

companions which probably amounts to I

found one of them I punch him

alright um he is great with your necks

on his attack he's going to try to

grapple you uh you can make a strength

athletics check to oppose him maybe

that's one that I can actually succeed

at this guy recession uh sixteen oh

that's good um okay you were able to

pull yourself free of him I do not

appreciate being manhandled this way all

right

and uh D F or sorry uncle and even

you're up next I want to hit him but I

look at the sweet snoring little

feathery baby it's it's completely dark

where you are you can

see anything well I still look at it

yeah ha ha ha has lit a little bit and

I'm just like it's time to go and I

continue retreating alright now you've

what your winged boots can actually fly

up the stairs and not be hindered by

their hide you just so I can like

carefully create a waffle so she doesn't

get jarred at all ok and up you go and

next up is DF um I heard all them call

out within the darkness yes yes tempting

um go for it samer cover my escape

alright uh no rather so I got one of my

throwing daggers rather than throwing it

at the voice that was going after it

evylyn I'm going to intentionally throw

it uh pass out the opposite direction

that we are going so you just hear a

sound over there ok

just like distraction noise alright and

then using that with my impeccable

stealth roll mhm yes like a phantom make

my way up the stairs unseen unheard yes

even by your friends ok so you're all up

this you make your way up the stairs

Jasper follows swiftly on after DF and

you eventually get to the top of the

stairs you seem to have at least

temporarily lost the drow probably

because they don't they didn't see the

staircase before the darkness was cast

they it was a good call on your part and

they'll take them a while to find it hmm

when you get to the top of the stairs

you enter what appears to be a large

Hall probably used by the fire giants as

a gathering hall there are great pillar

four great pillars that support the

ceiling two large tables that have some

overturned tankards and empty barrels on

the floor around them sort of like a

little party place for them there is a

dark hearth a big giant fireplace

against one wall and a hallway directly

across from you leading into darkness

there is a wider hallway to your right

that seems to lead back out onto an iron

gantry overlooking the assembly area and

on that gantry you see Luke zalto and

Duchess Grimm's Gardez two children

looking down yeah they've got their

backs to you push them over real badge

kill no cut up their babies am i still

strong I think I'm still strong yeah you

still got your strict oh you're so sweet

boys area before yeah uh you have not

your animals have peered into this area

waffles what did you say oh really

um but I guess old guy okay I can still

kind of get a feel of generally where we

at with in the guess the this facility

compared to how we got into here yes so

I you think and you can see that there

are more of those vents uh in fact the

the vent covers here have been popped

off

it looks like recently okay um more of

those vents in two walls on this room

and you can see we can see waffles is

sort of gnawing on her harness like she

wants to get out no no okay um we can

climb up the fireplace what isn't there

fireplace it should not go out that

should go out right presumably the smoke

has to go somewhere it has to go

somewhere but smoke and fire usually go

in there well but there's only one

fireplace so if it's not on fire then

you know it's yeah currently there's no

fire burning and the giant heart well I

was here while you guys go up to make

sure no one lots of fire

you have my boots you could go check

[Music]

okay we can't wait for someone I can't

wait for someone to check

find that fireplace as you as you are

shouting that in this room garnet why do

I always do that these two the two kids

just sort of both look back over their

shoulders into the room Oh for heaven's

sake into the fireplace is there any

kind of kidney or wood currently at that

fireplace uh there is evidence that

there was a fire there recently so

there's blackened Timbers they're quite

big like huge big caber sized logs

stuffed in there I try to help us push

those out all wax bread them yeah but

there's nothing like fresh to burn uh

there's there's probably some unburnt

like kindling and stuff piled next to

the fireplace

I wish point you here dad they're

upstairs

wait dad night can I do a I want to cast

a silent image of their of their their

mom just like in the room with us like

to the side and as we're just peek out

be like like other hands like I got it

[Laughter]

I'm trying to encourage everyone to go

up the chimney I'm like go go go I'm

sorry that Jimmy's gonna be real hi I'm

the person with the winged boots here I

have this straight potion I can push

everyone up I'll go last

plus I don't like it I'm Fire doesn't

even hurt me I'll be fine

I'm pretty good at climbing Eve look at

fly paltin how do you feel huh weights

tricks crystal strong paltin hold onto

our back and climb this out of here well

now hold on are you just gonna forget

about the drought that saved your lives

you can't believe it are you I'm cozen

well pleased to meet you and they'll

better turn upon you well here into this

chair that I hope you can climb because

I've that's our fastest exit alright so

be ready to hold your breath for when

the smoke comes real quick close it how

much do you love loss uh not good enough

see my side oh I don't like Waffen oh

okay cool cuz uh I don't know I just

don't feel like being poison today you

know how it is I'm gonna make the mom

the mom statue is just gonna like wink

at her kids like give them a thumbs up

hard idea into usually a wink been

working out real well for me alright

well we have a plan we're going out the

chimney of the this mountain forget

forever meanwhile salt embers like oh I

think mom's up here yes I can also here

down there so I think they just cast a

spell to fool us all this okay just have

her mouth I love you son she's a fire

giant she maybe it'll give him some you

know maybe it's what he's always wanted

to hear exactly all right awesome you

give them a moment she just makes a

heart what is what is the order that

you're going up the shaft uh probably

evylyn first so she can just fly and

won't be hunted by anyone I can help

lift people cuz I can fine you also got

waffles with you yeah uh how wide is

this shaft so when you look go into the

fireplace and look up you can see that

the shaft is about five feet diameter

woah so small oh four fire Giants but I

mean fire Giants can't fit up this yeah

so we can okay um god yeah so we'll go

and it's not a it's not absolutely

smooth work it's like our human out of

the Living Rock so there are

there are rough handholds and great

purchases perfect okay looks like it was

carved by dwarves all right so if it's

rough enough then actually is feasible

for us to climb it if it's not just

completely smooth stone even could fly

up I'm pretty good at climbing uh least

I can climb up quickly um Strix even

with your strength you'll still move the

slowest and if paltin if you're not

confident in your own climbing skill I'd

say hold onto Strix well she wastes you

up other dude you go last y-yeah now I'm

trying to save all of ours god this is

this is surface-dwellers for you hey

none of that how about you mean meanie

right okay so up you go uh with evil and

blazing the way evylyn it is so filthy

dirty up here you can barely stand to

even touch the walls I was like I'm

flying a 9,000 years of soot on the

walls

yeah is Jasper still with us uh yeah and

he'll actually um can I go before Jasper

sure yeah you can go before desperate

yeah all right Jasper uh doesn't I was

also the way you heal us do you can do

to help us get out of here faster mmm

God we can sign him to death uh let me

see you do well he can cast he can

provide illumination if you need that as

you probably would uh so um let's see

you can find traps got a lot of good

that'll do um and even sufficient time

he can do a spell to divine whether or

not this is a good idea but you don't

have time for that

no yes and then uh let's see mmm nope

although he he does have some more

healing all right well don't don't that

time so okay you can also cast bless but

it doesn't look like you need that at

the moment yeah

we're not finding anything we are leave

it all right

oh he can cast however a spell called

guidance to give bonuses to give

somebody a bonus on their client checks

so he will do that on Judith Trey listen

you probably have a strength higher than

eat yeah cuz yeah these these in little

arms and desperate the client might just

yeah Thank You Jasper so yes so you get

to add at the ad it's like one or two

yeah yeah also before we go into the

shaft I'm going to change the minor or

then change the silent image to be just

a facsimile of us okay in the other

corner of the room okay so this sort of

dumbly staring party yes yeah okay too

accurate all right

as you heard yourselves upstairs those

who are not flying please make a

strength athletics Jack Walton you don't

have to make one because you are hanging

on to Strix and my strength is what I

want to be 23 that's right do you add

plus six okay that's

yeah I've also got that second-story

work so I can climb up pretty quickly

yeah okay okay I got 18 and don't forget

DFU a daddy for to your role because of

the guidance spell Oh ad d 4o k e4 hey

how'd you do cozen I rolled a nineteen

excellent Trix 18 good yeah 13 good

enough alright uh so you crawl up you

crawl up this shaft

evylyn you get to the top way before

they do and you see that it tilts about

45 degrees and continues to climb at a

45 degree angle that's really hard for

me to to not get dirty yeah it's really

difficult like you're oh Jesus

strict so yell I feel like I'll fix it

for you once we get out of here thank

you

that's all right uh 45 degrees is way

easier to the climb out of things yeah

basically just becomes a hill so yeah

yeah

after a 45 degree climb uh for about a

hundred feet it meets up with what

looked like two other chimney shafts

coming in at various angles and they all

become one shaft going up another 30

feet and then breaking into what appears

to be a large sustained cave a cave

there's a haze up here is there any

fresh air coming out or anything like we

could you don't smell any fresh air um

and when you come up into this cave you

can see that it there's actually a smoky

haze hanging there like it's sort of

trapped up here and hasn't completely

filtered out in their areas yet so evil

in your your attempt to stay clean was

probably for not in the end strikes

really likes this place I immediately

started looking around for where the

smoke can go out of this place okay our

minds our sigil yep as you look around

and study your surroundings it becomes

very clear to you that this cave and the

tunnels leading away from it must be

part of the much larger mining complex

it's probably this looks like a corner

of or part of the mines that runs

Mountain oh we get to do lots more

exploring nailedit but it appears as you

come up here and all your sarcasm alarms

go off yeah that this is definitely a

much safer place probably the safest

place you've been in a long time yeah

until they light a fire yeah you also

get the impression that

there aren't any tracks in the certain

accumulated stuff on the floor here this

is a section of the mines that is not

visited I look around as I wait for the

rest of my party to come up and in this

cave do I see any large boulders or

anything I could potentially use to like

clog the chimney behind us yes with

enough if you want to put your time and

attention toward doing that you can

amass enough rocks and boulders and

stuff to essentially create a cap of

rocks that cover this thing so while I'm

waiting for them that's what I'm doing

I'm gathering those okay you're all up

you all get up and you're all in this

cave safe and sound

all right and then imagine evylyn points

out the blocks of chimney plan and then

yeah I'll be direct everyone to help her

with that clog up that chimney just stop

as much smoke as we can okay I shall

love teamwork yeah this is a great

teamwork exercise so a liver the next

over the next hour you gather and

assemble rocks an hour yeah so I give us

a short rest not it not if you're piling

rocks this districts ifs tricks you're

gonna help I'm gonna say if you don't

want to be look you don't want to use

your super strength to help you can sit

I thought it'd be like one big rock that

was our super strength combined we could

go okay you could there isn't a huge

rock that size but you could essentially

break off a section of like a

outcropping from the wall yeah I like

point to this spot and I'm like strikes

punch right here okay so slice one one

punch man okay so you're able to get a

big rock and drag it over to essentially

cover the opening yeah all right that

takes about ten minutes sweet great good

now let's go so it looks like there's

only like one exit out of this kind of K

where there are there are two there are

two tunnel exits out of the cave leading

in opposite directions but you're not

sure which direction they go like

cardinal directions you've had a loss by

bearings

I figured all right uh oh gosh can we

can we rest for a second or what that

yeah but you could definitely rest if

you want to why don't we eat Carlton why

don't you get your your party your party

Hut we're not sleeping here oh I'm so

tired though I know we're also still

holed up inside the fire giant mountain

I since I've all covered in soot I'm

like and I like hug crying little Strix

to my bosom and try to comfort her no

not what I wanted so step away and then

use your Frankie stop he'll cast my

prestidigitation to clean your outfit so

that you'll stop touching her Thanks all

right so all the dusted set just falls

away from you easily uh is there any

kind of movement within the smoke that

was in here as well just kind of resting

it's all resting damn it okay good idea

though yeah I just asked myself what is

Lysander telling me huh okay um so

you're looking for a sign site check I'm

looking for an insight check I guess

okay trying to make an inside check I

roll a natural one you think that role

ruin that role um you are convinced that

that maybe maybe Lysander sent you this

this Dark Elf for a reason what that has

nothing to do with which way to go huh

all right are you actively searching for

ways out they can see two ways out but I

can I see that they are sort of

contemplating yes I do yes absolutely

you're privy to all this well in that

case I say no no wait a minute you guys

aren't planning on leaving are you

I go like right up to his face I'm like

really really close to it like this

close and I'm like I see the blessings

of life and you will lead us which way

do we go

i i'm just so stunned for a second but i

decided to roll

with it yeah and I just say I don't know

what God sent me but I'm fairly sure or

whatever God sent you sent you to stop

what salto is planning or did you think

that was just a regular flask II god I

didn't see a flask I was unconscious

okay

I look at like specifically and say or

did you think that was a regular class

yeah at that point it's like back to

full seriousness mode and bet this

droughts like fine clearly you know

something tell us everything well I can

only tell you what Varys told me the

cocoa salt sought our services to

procure the means of reinvigorating his

familial Colossus you might have seen it

down there we sure did we wrecked it oh

good good well it'll be well now wait a

minute did you wreck it wreck it or just

they sent it over all right that's not

that's not that's hardly enough we at

least all their plans an attempt at

destroying whatever that heart thing was

you didn't go great you definitely

definitely inconvenienced him slightly

slightly and for that you should be

commended and this is me commending you

by telling you you actually have solved

nothing ah that flask contained mogera

that on titan a fire primordial enormous

ly powerful and destructive enough to

reinvigorate his familial forge iron

slag with it he's going to resurrect

that Colossus and come and destroy

pretty much you know everything and ice

Quinn said I never got a chance to ask

did dwarf send you or was that or do

they just really not like dwarves they

just really don't like Wars oh well now

they think you're now they think the

dwarves are with you so

oh you know Jesse was just sort of waves

at that point so if you leave this as is

he's going to use that Colossus to

destroy every dwarf he possibly can and

those that he can't destroy the drought

will come mop up later and then you know

I I don't want to say it'll be your

fault but it'll it'll be your fault

and what business with the drought

having this they want to foment war we

do like war that's all they ever do to a

surface folk to what purpose to kill and

conquer like have you not met a drow

before no sanity was nice all right yeah

no that's

Evelyn's face was all sunny and then as

he said like to kill and conquered all

assess she starts like kind of like

wrinkling your nose

but you've met one that isn't all about

killing and conquest here's one that's

just about killing they just want to

turn us all into slaves

it is true how many people turning into

slaves

I like that very much at all well then

you're going to have to stop zalto

recover that flask and then I shrug and

say or just blow it up I like blowing

things up can't blow anything up if I

don't have any blow yup you left

well the Colossus is powered by a heart

which I believe you saw in yeah we sighs

yeah

and yet making exactly this gesture I

say tell me how that went

Oh another semantics still healing

something as strong as the adamantine

heart that powers the Colossus can only

be powered by Megara but it can also be

destroyed by Megara well you Negra

Megara is the fire primordial in the

flask that we delivered to zalto and

that you pointedly looking at DF almost

stopped you points for trying

Oh points you're not exactly making a

real strong case for us keeping you

around I don't really mind if I would

suggest keeping me around because you

guys don't seem to be doing too great

here so got some rude maybe that's what

we want you to think all right

I'm clear I'm going to go along with the

idea this is the most cunning plan I've

ever seen

and then reiterate that unleashing the

fire primordial in that flask in such a

way could it destroy the adamantine

heart it could end the Colossus and ends

Altos threat to the dwarves and just

about anyone considering it would

probably blow up the mountain so the

flask itself just needs to be what

opened opened and melted on top of the

heart opened and melted so the unit well

you I'm sorry you believe that

mogera is trapped in the flask opening

it will release her uh if she is just

released it'll be a fire primordial you

know on the loose and uncontrollable all

that on the lamb on the lamb uh if she

were released in saltos adamantine for

she would be trapped in the Forge thing

is she's the only one hot enough

essentially to melt the adamantine heart

way heart to be destroyed that would be

bad within that doors flow Civ within

the floors she's trapped yeah by the

heart her she could if she's Unleashed

she can destroy the heart and doing so

will pretty much take care of zalto

cozen you know that since zalto has the

flask it is likely that he almost

certainly it could be mogera is already

been from the flask it could time that's

always a chance yeah but there's also a

chance that he's busy tending to his

wounded wife right now

and there's also a chance that he's

searching for the Dwarven spies running

around his Citadel absolutely

who could pop back up and sabotage it at

any moment no way oh ho

what have you got to lose Lee there

won't be a home if you leave now yep

he's not going to stop with the dwarves

but sorry Couzens did you tell them I

can't remember did you tell them what

happens if the heart is destroyed you

mentioned something about the mountain

uh yes the mountain will explode way

pretty much with enough destructive

force to level the mountain and possibly

everything within sight of the mountain

and like all of us yes all of us I mean

we we are in the mountain and there's no

way we could run far away enough to not

be destroyed along with this so what if

we were to instead take the heart blow

it up somewhere else well that's a

possibility but there's also no telling

how long it would take to explode the

mountain could take minutes could take

hours it's a primordial she works at her

own pace well all I know is that poor

little strict's tired and I'm not

feeling so great myself and I have the

teachings of will stay under teach us

that when one can rest to replenish one

should you know what that's a great idea

just sleep on it and I'm sure I'm sure

Duke salto will just hang out in the

meantime but also question

mmm babe this whole mountain blow up

right right all right so let's say we

were like in a hut it's a good hut a

magical hut a mighty powerful hut gone

you have intrigued me with your Hut

speak whoever's in the hut is protected

some time like you know a little

balances out right because we'll be good

right JIT i gestured to my armor i say

i'm not a wizard man like i can't tell

you for sure if that's going to work or

not i don't feel good about blowing up

everybody in this town there are a lot

of slaves here some really cute little

doggies

I don't feel like we can just blow them

up

oh yeah now that a dude paltin do you

really believe that your heart could

potentially withstand the explosion of

an adamantium hood caused by a Titan

caused by a primordial I'm sure his hat

could withstand anything he wanted Strix

I Strix you can make an Arcana check at

this point yes please

I'm very dubious of all of this ah

sixteen okay um so the dome of force

that surrounds the Hutt um creatures and

objects within the dome are protected

obviously can move inside all other

creatures and objects are barred from

passing through it so spells and other

magical effects can't extend through the

dome or be cast through it so if the

heart is this big magical construct it's

possible that if the Hutt would in fact

protect you and now you might be buried

literally but the other thing you know

is that based on the heart as you saw it

briefly and what cozen has just told you

a fire primordial um he's right in that

it's very difficult to predict like if

you were to give the heart to mogera or

throw the heart in the fort where she is

trapped you don't know how long it would

take her to melt through its adamantine

exterior to trigger the explosion all

right hey it's a novels really

predictable I'll relay this to the group

Britta grudgingly so what do you think

we should do Strix oh don't ask me that

that's not no I just want you to decide

your opinion just gonna cover her head

up with her cloak and just lay on the

ground I just want you to know that I

care about your opinions I love you very

much

whoa so it could take minutes or it

could take potentially hours can I tell

that paltin is a bard

yeah probably he's got a lute and he's

got bagpipes and I look at him and say

potentially enough time for a very

dramatic exit wink

haha dude I'll know what your deal is

but you showed up start winking and we

all almost died right everyone's alive

because of your old foul cozen don't

wink it how about how about this how

about this Chozen why don't you go in

and do this as a stealth mission

again I gesture to my armor and say I'm

flattered but we can make you invisible

it's fine no do it I work like you go

down there and do it if you're asking us

to I'm just saying I'm not asking

anything I'm just telling you what will

happen and how you can stop it

the point is at this knowing what we

know now and what needs to be done this

is damn well close to a suicide mission

that's what I was trying to say and you

know I don't I just don't be dead again

just I hope fly by all accounts DF

you've completed the task that King Hart

off set before you yeah I just think

they're certain to be another better way

to handle this as soon as we just get

rested I don't think that there's any

way that Lysander would want us to blow

up an entire mountain of people I know

that he has something else in mind

I look over toward the drow I'm just

like well I mean this guy seems to know

everything about everything so I got

faith in him doing it on his own evil

ends like delighted by that way if you

like yes look I'm like as well and

that's where we'll stop for tonight all

right did I survive you survived

adventure yes so Santa's throne done Sam
