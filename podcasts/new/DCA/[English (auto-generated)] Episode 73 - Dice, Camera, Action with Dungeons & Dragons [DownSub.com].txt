hello everybody and welcome to dice

camera action

as you have noticed that's right there

is no Chris Perkins joining us today so

we do not have a dungeon master as we're

gonna be doing a special episode so

where we last left off the party paltin

thanks to his special sneak abilities

led us to the city of omou and on the

way we found a crashed airship the star

goddess did some stuff and paltin put on

the ring of winter but we're actually

going to rewind time just a little bit

as we were in or illunga where we had

met the mystic naga lady who direct just

OMA this nursin and on the way from

aural ugh - oh Moo was a few days of

travel this is going to take place

during those few days of travel and

joining us for this episode is our

special guest mark Humes and we work

from here I am actually going to just

let you take it away really quick I like

to imagine lengths cinematically like I

put the ring on and then it cuts and

then just kind of like anyway might be

wondering how we go out so this kind of

situation kind of deal like a freeze

frame yeah so you guys were I'm gonna

kind of I apologize if I slip into DM

mode I can't help it they are longer to

omou and you've been traveling through

the jungle I think it took you guys

about two three days right so at least

yeah so on maybe sort of the morning of

day two you're traveling through jolt

it's hot it's humid it's sweaty and

miserable and the jungle is really you

know just all around you you eat at gem

these signs of life you see the fading

kind of crumbling stones of Tilton and

Omer and sort of cultures but generally

you don't really see any signs of life

maybe fend off a couple of flying

monkeys and things like that maybe a

couple of assassin vines but on the

morning when your stomach's are starting

to get a bit crumbly maybe you've only

been eating trail rations you've been

drinking kind of you know filtered water

you kind of start to hear the strange

sound and you can hear just kind of

coming up a little distance away maybe

no 60 feet or so you begin to hear this

kind of old voice and it sounds like

singing and you kind of hear this kind

of faint trail of a song I'm kind of my

pretty shell go set by the sea my pretty

shell girl waiting for me and you see it

kind of crouched on all kind of

overturned blog with a kind of very

ramshackle but not very well-kept

campsite is this shelled turtle this

kind of old turtle that he's wearing a

hat like a kind of floppy fisherman's

canvas straw hat and he's kind of there

and you can see that he's fumbling with

something in these giants or call like

flipper hands and his shell has all

these different colored markings and

drawings and patterns on it you can see

that there's just stuff everywhere and

he's just idly humming to himself and

you notice for the first time that

there's no real sense of death or

there's no sense of decay around him

it's also fairly good vegetation there's

no animal sounds I mean you can just see

this little fella just singing along

kicking his feet bias by this large rock

am I going barmy or does anyone else see

that is it just me what anything I go

hide in a bush you hear that you can see

this turtle kind of looking around and

he's got like a little walking stick and

he's prodding it rocks and things like

that

is that girl and he's like poking at the

the stones and logs and things like that

but he did you know you're not sure if

if he's necessarily heard where you're

from but you can smell something he said

there seems to be some sort of cooking

fire going and you begin to smell soar

sweet spices and though I like that bush

[Laughter]

and yeah he kind of okay you can just

see this kind of list little old fella

kind of sitting on the log and you see

kind of turns around he's kind of

squinting your way looking over his eye

and you see well yeah when you pop up he

kind of his eyes kind of go wide and you

can see that this turtle is old he looks

ancient his skin is extremely leathery

he kind of shakes a little bit with

every kind of movement and his head kind

of wobbles as he looks up you say oh my

goodness how could you any kind of like

taps you on the leg this is his still

robot even like your little claims a

little bit like I love them away he's

just Sagan what have we got here a small

metal boy and a man with with a big

bladder which is this his contraption he

wears what is this he's pointing at

Paulson's bagpipes this is like kind of

pointy

oh not much not one to get many visitors

out here insult what are you doing

around here these folks just passing

through we're just trying to get our way

to all moment mean to my studio oh boy

come here come here any kind of waddles

oh boy

and he holds up his little Claud kind of

hands and he's like oh look you're so

small and skinny and he's like looking

at your arms she said oh no this one's

funny like he goes over to the Laughing

bush and he starts

what are you doing no it's not a mimics

tricks it's it's out to steal your

turtle stuff she's running I imagine

he's just like trying to hit her with

his this mister does not chase you very

far he maybe takes three steps and he's

like no I need to sit down

well you don't look like you're undead

and you don't look like you dinosaurs so

you are are you hungry

I mean oh my apologies metal woman

playing clang clang now my name is Joe

hands come with SOPA come to come come

my life now Rick's is gonna go around

the camp and start like checking to see

if they're trapped or in another no no

he's like throwing like steaks and rocks

at you he's just like I mean you can

make an investigation check I guess our

perception check Stern I'm gonna roll

some dice please be the old all

throughout the whole Lab so streaks

Yorker I'm looking for traps and you can

see one of the few things that you

notice you kind of get quickly

distracted because you can see that

among all of this weird Turtles stuff

like this cooking equipment

a couple of this actually got to camp

fires going and like various like bits

and bobs here and there but you notice

she's got a lot of light well-worn

travelers kits you can see things like

map sticking out of like little pouches

you notice like strange little ornaments

like you notice things from water deep

and armed the city of arm itself like a

you know a essential embracement with a

messengers symbol from arm yeah you

could get that sense but you don't

notice with your colossal perception of

one air that he kind of claps his hands

and a kind of an opaque sphere coming

from so if you're familiar with a spell

lemons tiny hot disco we're familiar

yeah so you kind of noticed that he pops

this spell around and it kind of

enshrouds his campus i and he said no no

need to worry about monsters now o Zopa

looks after guests now and he kind of

sits down and he looks you ease on now

metal woman pink ring ring thank you

that's real nice my name is Evelyn

Avalon a helluva k---mart same

conservative lysander and I'm just so

pleased to meet you

oh very friendly you say a lot of things

how do you work and he's like I've seen

some golems in my time but not one like

amazing it's just where is Lysander

wants it to work isn't it cool yes this

is I have never seen my magic or

engineering of this kind before

wonderful now you are clearly will fall

very colourful characters um well you

don't look like you've had good food for

a few days I was I was going to cook up

my my my hot pot but uh with with you I

can cook a large batch if you like and

you can have a hot meal and you'll be

quite safe here for some time if you

wish old Zopa knows how to make a

campsite and make it safe is is Jewish

too we would not be delighted to have

learned hospitality the count of three

before about a Poulton oh well I have

learned many things cooking is not one

of my finest skills but I've learnt a

trick or two ah we'll need a few things

but well I tell you what and he kind of

starts divvying out a few things and he

hands our arm he pulls out from a kind

of a satchel bag that looks like it's

quite thin he pulls out a a cockatrice



and what appears to be wrapped up stakes

and he's like well I need someone to do

feather and DA and to and pluck well to

defer the cockatrice and I need somebody

to tenderize this ankylosaurus State oh

I like tenderizing all right all right

evening of metal evening you drew this

and he kind of lays it down on a rock

and he gives you like a rolling pin and

he's like you tenderize that well you

got six he hands you the the the

cockatrice to deep feather and and then

he hands over to DF a bunch of what

appeared to be onions like Colonel iki

onions he's like now you cut these took

these my boy chop these my boy

my lord count of course I would not dare

if you were tardy but perhaps perhaps

you could start to tear something - why

how did the four of you come to travel

together I'm a collector of stories of

sorts I I would greatly desire to hear

how for such as yourselves have been

found ourselves here whacking the

ancestors you have to start it because

you guys met earth Strix is biting the

feathers off of the wrong car cockatrice

carcass there's a bunch in her mouth and

she's just like death takes out one of

his saw throwing daggers and use that to

kind of start what he assumes is a

proper way to cut up an onion he's

actually super cry

they are quite pungent when you start

chopping into them says Michaels fish

shoots they have like they're a very

pungent but not enough to make someone

cry yeah if there's a deer if there's a

nearby fire that should kill the tear

gas it should be okay yeah and then

death will say how we came together well

dad found me in the trash she's like

biting things up yes that seems to fish

yes it's not I mean it's

entirely far from the truth I guess I

mean I just it was in modern tea and I

was I was just simply enjoying a lunch

thought I was having on on the rooftops

away from people away from guards away

from peering eyes and in the in the

crowds I just saw this black bass moving

very in a very peculiar way and I was

just it was really fascinating so I'd

never seen anything like that and and I

also saw how every person passing by

treated her like she was nothing and I

was because I smell

maybe maybe about me not sure if it was

pity or empathy or whatever it was but I

I know what that feeling is like too and

I just didn't wasn't right and she was

clearly hungry

so I just you know we figured out where

she liked to stay the witch alleyway

she'd like to be at I had to started

leaving Strix a little bit of food just

that she wouldn't have to go hungry yeah

I could tell you took a liking to those

feathers yeah it took some time but

eventually she agree to trust me and I

trust her I mean this was after you

through a fire bolt at me I'm pretending

it's easier than talking you know

Baghdad's I had just come back from the

plains and I didn't know that much about

torille were the people here and so it

was just like yeah it's not her fault I

slipped on something and made a noise

and it spooked her I was trying to make

sure that she's getting the food but I

guess that's officially the first time

you saw me in your initial reaction was

a thrill fire no it's okay now I don't

hit you with the fire though yeah well

she had good reason she had lots of

reasons to throw fire she had a hard

time before that didn't you stress yes

yeah it was bad but I mean it was just I

I was going around the plains and after

I'd been released from my grandmother

who actually was turns out to be was a

crazy hag games baba yaga remember that

she was grandma's real evil but as soon

as I got out of the Fae wild I was

traveling after sigil and and then

that's how I ended up in Torah but sigil

was the worst the hive was the worst it

was the I collected bodies for jenkin

brought him brought him to the dust man

that's how I made money you came here

and then did you you traveled with this

young DA that you traveled were young

dear Woodrow here and this is how you

met the others perhaps yeah we were I

guess we were together for a few years

and I you know I didn't really have a

job neither of us really had money but I

was just trying my hand at I guess being

an adventurer as what you would call it

we never really got into fights we would

basically try and define anything that

we could around the city of Waterdeep it

was enough to get by if we're finding

grand treasures or getting rich or

anything but it was enough to sometimes

have a nice meal or somewhere to sleep

at night or somewhere to bake a pie

there somewhere to make a pie I know

this life well yes and how did how did

you meet evylyn best in fact that's

actually how came to be is one night we

had enough coin to either have there's a

choice between a good meal or a nice bed

and after several days of travel we went

with nice bed so we went to it we were

doing in and just so happens that evylyn

was there yep

we didn't I didn't really pay much

attention to her at first well I went

there every day back then cuz you know

well I'm sure that if you've traveled as

much as you have you know that the most

important things in life are Beauty

enjoyed preserving the light and and

what better way to experience beauty and

joy and preserve the light than to

listen to music so you know working as a

paladin of a sander all day and trying

to help people and and being at the

hospital and then you know fighting

monsters and whatever else and I would

want I'd get real tired and then to

recharge as well say under ordered I

would find some beauty and I love to

listen to music and one day I just heard

the most beautiful music coming out of

this kind of seedy place but I went

inside and I saw Paulson and he was

playing music and it was just the most

beautiful music I had ever heard and so

I just started going to watching him

every single night it wasn't that CD I

mean you're right it was real nice and

you were it was CD enough yeah

but that first one we we you couldn't

play there anymore

for whatever reason and then we went to

a different one and then you couldn't

play there anymore for whatever reason

but then finally we ended up at the

rested pommel and that's where Diaz and

Strix okay Len but I mean I didn't

really say much to Politan back then you

know I don't know do you even remember

me come in that first place posit the

first place Wow let's think well I

wasn't allowed to play there anymore

because uh well let's just say the the

staff there wasn't thick-skinned enough

for my performance and then the second

place that that is that was the same

reason I would say it just I'm gonna I'm

gonna I'm an acquired taste and a lot of

people a lot of people just don't really

don't really know how to to fathom my

performance it's you you need a you need

a certain intellectual level to real

understand oh yeah it's hard for sure we

talked about the bagpipes I'm good

I know music and he's good but see he

didn't even notice that I was there no

of course not I I never I never take

notice to fans whatsoever they're just

you know that it's it's just it's it's

part of the lifestyle it's it just comes

with it you know maybe occasionally

maybe I'd recognize a repeated face from

time to time but I don't allow such such

attachments to happen in my career when

you're famous you just can't pay

attention to everyone you know I mean I

understand that but yeah that's how we

ended up with the roasted table and I

was listening to a set that Paulson was

playing and I knew every song so of

course I was thinking along but I

noticed dampens drinks come in and they

look real nice and then we down on look

dice I think you're just yeah that's

kind of you but I don't think we've

looked nice I mean I'm just minding our

own business

he didn't look nice yeah it's just when

you stay in Waterdeep long enough doing

the things you do at some point you do

develop a sort of reputation oh yes

either by you through truth or not

anyway we were just we were tired that's

all he wanted to do and we were there oh

you know what we were we were just what

maybe having a snack some sneaky sneaks

or something strikes and out of nowhere

this jackhole accuses me of stealing his

stuff which I would never do that bar

tables up yes he didn't like Colton's

music either he was a real snob and he

didn't know anything about music and I

obviously didn't know anything about

people I did not like

I only came to his establishment to

listen to Paulson mm-hmm it had nothing

to do with the fact that I was

completely hammered and couldn't even I

find any of the keys at whatsoever I

thought it sounded he was just he

accused me of stealing which is one of

the worst feelings but I I mean I don't

I don't even have an answer for this

part but for whatever reason he fling

that's why he was bad that's not it's

not just juice tricks but more

importantly evylyn food I don't know if

I've ever really had that before uh

stepped in well he's just a big jerk

I've seen him bully other people all

week and I was tired of it and I thought

you guys looked real sweet and we're

just having a nice little romantic

dinner and I just wanted to make sure

that it didn't get ruined

it wasn't romantic we were just trying

was covered in garbage I mean that

doesn't mean well anyway but I had seen

this coin pouch that he said you saw

earlier that day he just lost it and I

was just tired and he looks like he was

I mean he was going for the club

underneath that bar and he look like he

was menacing so I stepped in because I

didn't want him to hurt you and then you

know I gave him a little bit of a

talking to as I I mean just a little one

just reminded him about his

responsibilities about the whole bar to

fight I mean well eight I couldn't help

it that when I explained that maybe he

should you know not be a prejudiced

prick all the time that some of his

patrons agreed with me and started

yelling at him and then they started

yelling at each other about oh my drink

is too we can use short change me and

you have me money and you and my mother

and you know and soon enough everyone

was punching each other and they started

throwing their food which then I took

off the ground that is slack water the

deep and it did feel nice to know that

he was a jerk to everyone and not just

us

and then no he came it at strikes heaven

knows why and I'd it's because I've been

teef like you've never seen like point

Center horns these are bad to everyone

else besides this group of people

well then let's rest more and I think

that's just silly so I punched him in

the face it was great it was awesome

I remember that yeah and then he fell

down of course and it was just a single

blow just right between the eyes justice

even from where

evylyn stood she just instantly it's

like fluttered up super fascist path it

was impressive and this guy just goes

thud just instantly down yeah by this

point the entire bar was just kind of

going at it people are accusing each

other finally getting their rage out

maybe they're just drunk enough but I've

been around water deep enough to know

that this this was a seedy place and we

had to get out of there really really

fast because someone was going to call

the guards first I didn't want to leave

because I felt bad that I knocked him

out so hard I just wanted to make sure

he didn't hurt anybody so I was trying

to stay and heal him and stop the bar

fight and stop people from from damaging

things but dad convinced me that that

part of Waterdeep was pretty seedy and

those those guards weren't gonna listen

you had just done the both of us a huge

favor so the least I could do is make

sure you're not didn't get in trouble

so bad I knew the guard for coming I

knew we had to get him out of there

and I told evylyn that we had to leave

as soon as possible before they showed

up because those they aren't just city

guards like they are they are they're

bribes they're corrupt they'd rather

join them fight than stop it anything

that they can

anything they can do to blade their

swords even just for a night so I just

knew we had to get out of there yeah

yeah we did but you know paltin seems to

be kind of under the weather that night

and and I didn't want him to get caught

up in the scuffle so as we were leaving

I just asked hey Dee do you want to come

with us

and I don't know why I did but he says I

did I said you know what

this seems like as good a time as any to

you know venture out and you know find

new horizons so they invited me so I

said you know what let's do it so then I

went into the back room I grabbed my

stuff went into my locker I took I went

to the coin pouch that I had stolen from

the owner earlier and there all right I

didn't mention that was me my bad oh my

god Wow as always the stories come for

circle what a wonderful tale is such a

strange beginning and now you'll find

yourselves in church well of course we

had to you know once we once we were out

in the street we realized that Diaz and

Strix didn't have anywhere to go and I

guess neither did Colton once he lost

that place at the end so I had the

barracks of the spires where I stayed

and of course anybody's welcome there so

they stayed with me and I and then they

helped me with some errands of the

sander and then they stayed with me

another night and then you know I had

lots of jobs and adventures to go on and

and most of the things that they needed

to do involve you know striking down

monsters and stuff which I'm real good

at and laughs and wants me to do so he

just kind of started adventuring

together and we just never stopped

yeah just fell into place we were trying

to search dungeons caves lairs whatever

we could for the sake of adventure

evylyn wants to make the world a better

place you know yeah I guess our goals

was kind of aligned low on birds flock

together as they say well I have a quick

task that I will sell you for the so for

the hot pot where there's a few

ingredients we need and he super kinda

points evylyn and paulsen

the two of you you seem strong and Hardy

and I know that the count cordsen

strands obviously didn't take care of

himself and methylene is strong there's

some mushrooms not far from here a few

meters of feets perhaps he kind of hands

you like a sketchy looking drawing his

hands

shaking as he does but would you take

these gather a small basket of these for

me if you would I would start even still

hitting that oh this is those tender

ankylosaurus I think has ever been seen

yeah it's just flattened it's you know

this is schnitzel this is ankylosaurus

[Laughter]

yeah super hands you like a little

basket and he kind of hands a little

kind of sketchy piece of paper oh no my

old legs and shell can't go that far now

off you go and then he turns to D and

strikes and says that I will need your

help in getting a good slow but hot fire

going my steps or fingers and the fire

just goes sorry

ah and then he just kind of easy to say

I I am going to just go over my recipe

you make sure that that fire stays hot

and slow we wanted a continual burn nice

and even

yeah sure I'll get Jake shakes the naked

cockatrice in front of him oh yes give

that to give that to soap I will deal

with this you're just talk amongst

ourselves oppa will deal with this now

and he starts like pulling it apart and

chopping it off and things like that you

just look over sadly as he's like you

can occasionally pops the chicken feet

in his mouth and let there spits them

out oh dear Zelda Sarah keep at the

onions using his throwing dagger he's

like oh my dude I'm doing do I cut do I

cut the green part like no no you got it

now here it's like shows like please

kids I don't want to get I mean I'm

gonna cut myself if I get a or two your

knives just show me how to do it okay

it's tricks will show you how to do it

and she'll like take your dagger just

like

like fin pieces if you're too thick no

one's gonna want to eat it it'll be like

like a sticker too you know and don't

rock meat and rocks all right this is

already nicer than anything I've ever

made and even and Poulton you guys once

you kind of step outside the apiece of

LeMans hot bubble the jungle is quite

quiet and then there's a kind of the Sun

is kind of slowly rising it's still

quite early morning and the sound dies

down and there's almost a serene peace

to this kind of area it seems that you

know the sort of taint that has may be

infested other parts of chawl hasn't

quite reached into the section of the

jungle flowers occasionally bloom you

can see like moss and herbs growing up

the sides of trees and it's just quite

quiet and a little bit serene did you

hear where you said we were supposed to

get these mushrooms politics I haven't

heard much of anything all day who was

that guy I mean he seems nice and he

wants us to get some mushrooms so I

don't know we should probably look for

him work it's fine I'll look for him you

just come keep me company fair enough

I will I can I will provide the ambiance

and I will just like strum a little

something on the mandolin oh my goodness

it's like the old days isn't even kind

of closes her eyes and listens she's

like did you did you really steal that

pouch was that really you

like I mean is it a problem if I did cuz

I didn't realize that was that was oh no

of course I mean I mean I just didn't

know I mean I didn't know that you ever

stole anything I mean I thought you made

so much money from playing music that is

that is that is quite a statement no it

uh no I

we had jumped from from shitty bar to

shitty bar because uh well eh

you know I would get a little bit

disorderly during my performances but to

be fair I was being grossly underpaid so

I have leave that I had reason to it was

very upsetting we were we it's not a

good time for the industry you know

industry yeah let's go with that but

it's it hasn't been easy at least it

wasn't before not that it's been easy

because not that what we've done is easy

but it is it's been more stable in a way

if that makes sense do you think so

I'm not stable but consistent it's been

consistent with its well with diss

adventuring so that's been ok I don't

know what I would mean it talk to you

because I I feel like I haven't made it

much easier I haven't made it real

consistent I feel like I oh you're a

real big apology Politan why well I mean

it's probably probably obvious why but

you're right I should say it because I

should own it but when we did the ritual

and and I was about to be pulled into

who knows what by the soul monger I I

thought that what was happening was that

I was being found unworthy to pass on

until the Sanders courts and I thought

that that was my just reward and I

thought that when you rescued me that

that was you sorting with Sanders plan

and I know that's so stupid now and know

how stupid that is now I know that you

were just edit an instrument of his good

and they you did something so amazing

and so beautiful and then the first

thing I did is look at myself in the

mirror and think about myself and ask

you to kill me and completely discount

what you would

and I just must have ruined something so

beautiful and so perfect that you did

and I know how wrong that was and how

unkind that was and it's just been

weighing on me and I'm real sorry I

don't I don't do anything for a god I do

what I think is right I didn't I didn't

do what I did because I was like oh I am

an instrument of missing mr. shiny man

upstairs or whatever I saw I saw

somebody I care about in trouble and

felt that I could help so I didn't

because that's the right thing to do

it's not I wasn't any instrument

it was just that's what that's what

seemed like the right thing to happen at

that time was you're such a better

person than me I just well then I going

where we're at you know the castle and

and I should have known you have this

big plan of how you're going to destroy

straub shadow and now you're going to

smite this evil from the world and do

this amazing thing and and all I can

think about is that I'm scared of losing

you and and also I'm jealous jealous cuz

I see you and Esther walking hand in

hand down the aisle and I know I have a

problem with envy and I always had my

whole life and I've tried real hard to

get over it but I too come to envy and I

just I should have trusted you instead

of tackling you and in the middle of the

wedding ceremony when you probably had a

plan that that just got in the way of

and and and I'm sorry for that too plan

right well I saw you destroy that shadow

there's real cool we use that sword it

was really yeah that was some that was

some some some good improvising that

went down

Oh God yeah all the wedding stuff my

plan was well hope something happens and

it did sellers yeah I was according to

plan well what was good what were you

gonna do if it didn't happen um live a

really dark and edgy life what what I I

had all my eggs in the in in the hope

basket you could say well I understand

hope that's for sure mm-hmm it was a

gamble and it worked

now as I all right and that's kind of I

don't know that's the same that's the

same reason really I've done anything in

my life and that joining you guys

everything was straw it was all just

there is no there's never been a plan

it's been it's just been off of gut

feeling really you never do anything

with a plan it's too much work

how do you well how do you know which

direction to go or what thing to do I

mean I have a hole I spent my whole life

memorizing like lists of rules and and

ways to battle and and precepts and

guidelines and how do you know what to

do when I don't I never do I never do

until I've made the decision to do it

and then I just hope that it was the

right decision

huh I'm gonna cut in there and jump back

to da fence tricks with Zopa if that's

cool

so you guys are kind of helping super

kind of sort out the camp while those

two are away chatting away and Zoop is

gonna look over to DF constriction he's

Oh

you mentioned sigil and the plains

before sticks hmm my name is Strix

st are

I fix streaks that's what I said

foolish tiefling and he just kind of

like points us to kiss you anyway you

mentioned the plane Sidra before I've

heard of these bases very dangerous have

you been there recently is this part of

your adventures you mentioned soon as he

says recently Strix just gets on the

ground and is like looking around he's

like whoa she is with fever

she's okay oh we we went there recently

she'll get back up and start doing work

again like nothing happened

and just be like yeah there's we'll be

back unfortunately there's these I don't

really understand it maybe you

understand it better than EDF but I

don't know what's happening with this

whole mercy killer thing I just I don't

understand who are the schizocarp a I

don't know well if they're if they're my

family why don't they like you I don't

know turtle man do you know I don't know

anything I don't like you two obviously

have some sort of history if you need

some quiet time I can be see my cell

phones oppa's ears can turn off - oh I

have some of that you want some yes

he pulls out he actually pulls out a

bottle which I guessing maybe Strix

would be familiar with it's actually a

bottle of fire wine that he kind of

troubles over and he say good stuff

pours it on the cup hands over to the

pair of you thank you just like sip sip

but also just puts her face in the cup

and just doesn't move Strix I think I

saw them Oh

disk is exert just

is right before I step back through the

portal I just there was there's a lot of

different creatures of things around us

and like there's a couple of them

they're definitely tiefling they're

dressed and all black and the way that

they spoke to each other looked at you

mean definitely they definitely saw me I

don't know but just your hair she's just

like I don't understand I don't know

what it means but I think they were

there they know obviously they know

you're alive I saw me they saw you I

look I haven't been able to piece

anything together yet but did you see

anything else

no just them I got out of there as soon

as I could

the only thing we could do is just I

guess just keep trying to stay away from

our them from signal there's nothing

else we can do

we'll get to the bottom of it eventually

yeah we'll get to the bottom of the Skiz

excalibur that what is that word - there

was a word I don't think that's a word I

tried to think about it and I've never

heard that word before someone made it

up they baited up their and

they make up words dammit they're prone

to do that or do anything

turtleman Zopa doesn't heard the word

chasm before chasm of caldron cat I've

traveled I've traveled across faerûn but

there's very little of the plains that I

do know but I have not known the two of

you very long but you seem a smart pair

I'm sure that whatever troubles you will

be able to overcome together you ever

heard of the mercy killer Zopa I have

not I'm afraid my dear

streaks you don't want to know no I will

keep that oh I'm well beyond any threat

to anyone

old Soper is not long for this world now

I am just enjoying one last adventure

one last trip across a few lands I

remember and then I'll settle in to join

mother mother saloon for all of eternity

anyway nice oh she is I look up and

whenever I can see the moon and the Sun

pleases me greatly because always

remember you may worry about tomorrow

streaks or you may fret about yesterday

but today is the present and that is a

gift and he just kind of like toodles

back over to his little fire he carries

on um do you guys want to jump to the

other guys again what you guys want to

keep going yeah jump jump back to them

Strix is just gonna keep screaming I

think Evelyn has found some mushrooms

finally said she was kind of like just

putting something with basket and she's

showing Politan for approval

very good and she's like thank you never

you never plan anything why did you just

in the moment decide to come with us at

that time in the bar it was it was a

toss-up

it was looking at where where work was

taking me looking at how many

establishments were no longer in need of

my services it seemed like it was time

to do something drastic something

different and it felt like running off

with some strangers that gave me the

invite was the only other option it was

like a desperate career move

not like that's a desk less a desperate

move and just it was it was more

of a coin toss let's say it was well I

could go with them I have no idea what's

there or I could stay here and play

these gigs for these people who

don't even care

I said well unknown seems a little more

interesting than boring so I guess we

just all happened to be in the right

place at the right time cuz if you know

anyone in the entire world that asks you

to follow them you probably in that

moment would have said yes huh not

necessarily I I might have recognized

you after like the the the like 20th

performance or something like that at

that point I say you know what this

person has been consistently showing up

so in retrospect running off with with a

superfan maybe now I'm not the smartest

in the moment decision but it was

something and glad I did after the 20s

before I came to like 200 year

performances so you recognize me like

you know who I was for a long time what

is it really like 200 okay to be fair I

only remember I only remember maybe like

40 I mean it I'm not very good at

counting or anything so who knows who

knows no one can know I mean that's nice

that you I mean that you knew my face I

like to think that maybe that I don't

know that's nice she's kind of like

she's kind of like standing way too

close soon as she's like that size which

is like mushrooms mushroom yes yeah

those are you think how are we doing on

mushrooms how we doing on the search uh

I think we have enough with you yeah

I've got a small basket I imagine

all right you want to head back I have

plenty thanks for your help

no problem that's that's what I'm here

for maybe we should start heading back

yeah okay

she kind of like flutters long next to

him and she's like you could keep

playing if you wanted to say oh right

right sure mmm mandolins back out and

just start plucking away again on the

walk back I like that new one awesome

yeah so you guys have probably popped

back into the campsite I'm guessing

strict Cindy effort here you guys coming

with once you enter the bubble we always

have evylyn yeah terming away and like

you can hear this kind of faint mandolin

music playing and you can see like the

the smells decide to increase now you

can you can send like there's a big kind

of bubbling vat of water and you can see

zuper is just adding what appears to be

some herbs and things like that into it

and it kind of looks up is that oh good

yes bring me bring me your basket bring

me your basket back oh yes he kind of

starts getting three sniffs let me taste

a few throws a few away and then he

starts sorting all of those out to go in

the thing yes some of them poisonous but

mostly okay mostly fine they posit

didn't pick any because I can't get

poisoned very good thing actually yes

yeah sounds great

he's like now there's one last thing I

need ah and he kind of looks over he's

like metal girl you do not seem very

tired could you and I don't get tired

excellent even better

very useful you and um young master

Woodrow if you can help me just put the

finishing touches on the food I'm

streaks straight

perhaps you should accompany Lord Zarafa

CH in to and gather some things do you

happen to know what he says the name of

the bog willow bark happens to like it

is quite common inside if you could

fetch me some of that that would be most

marvelous

all right go for a count I'm doing a

little awful lot of fetch quest here we

don't die and of course you're such your

leadership is needed my lord you need to

ensure that such tasks are carried out

as well as the mushroom picking pollen

jesters head back is like guys today's

borderline non-canon we're not gonna die

[Laughter]

cannon cannon all right strict soil lead

paul's it into the forest just be like

oh you're just coming with me just ink

for cannon fodder speaking of cannon

[Laughter]

good brownie legs I mean really excuse

me excuse me sir I take my pen hold go

we're in the jungle we left I will tell

him excuse me I felt him insult my legs

[Laughter]

and yes open would just basically put

evil in and death to work helping him

kind of brown the meat and start

stirring the stew adding in vegetables

and things as they go and he kind of

looks over to D a few stayed what is ice

noticed you have quite a little charm

around your neck there young master

Woodrow Oh

smiles Oprah's good eyes poor hearing

but good eyes oh it's a sin amethyst Oh

ice is quite it yes from your

adventuring days

yeah actually ah I have carried a few

trinkets in my time is it sentiment no

magical that's it's definitely just

sentimental it's sometimes they are the

most important treasures yeah it's

really not really not that interesting

of a store

yeah it's so evil never told you this no

I'm really interested I think all your

stories are interesting oh alright

well again it's really not interesting

but this is this is even before I met

Strix so I had just it was really early

on in my adventuring days and I use that

term kind of loosely because I was

always by myself I wasn't much of an

adventurer and I didn't really I didn't

really like help people or go out and

solve problems or save anything or

whatever but I had to make money somehow

so what do you say a rounded water deep

long enough eventually you just kind of

learn where the the best places to be to

overhear the right boisterous people and

I happened to be at a at a tavern and

there's a part of the adventurers there

loudly boasting about their

accomplishments

they said they helped save the city of

flan but I don't know if we believe them

that place is always in trouble but they

had mentioned that there was a talk

about how they completely cleared out

this cave of Noel's slayed them all or

took their belongings now they're rich

and they were just giving out free

drinks at the bar that's where I took

one but I actually knew where this Knoll

cave was because I had heard about it

from other people but since they had

cleared it out you know that's that's

where I make my mark so I made sure I

went back to a same cave and I found

that layer and sure enough you know they

did a pretty thorough job they had

there's plenty of no bodies around they

had taken everything from them there

wasn't much weapons left everything had

been pretty ransacked through but they

had they make the same mistake that a

lot of other people do and they only

ever see what's on the surface mm-hmm so

knowing that I found I found a cluster

of Beryl

that basically had like a it was like

expired foodstuff said it by at this

point it had been probably several days

maybe even a week since they cleared out

and there's this all expired food to

smell really really bad but you always

gotta look for the hiding places of

where people want to hide hide their

personal belongings so I moved to one

barrel it was the first barrel I just

slid it over and sure enough right there

was a small pouch that it was probably

someone's like secret stash one that

knows Knowles probably trying to hide it

from the others and you definitely did

we do a good job I think he took like a

single handful of dust like sprinkled it

on top like that's somehow would

camouflage it further but inside that

little pouch there was just a handful of

silver a bit of copper and inside of

that was this amethyst which it was the

first treasurer I ever got and even

though I may not have had to do a whole

lot to get it it just ended up being

really important to me and I a lot of

people tried to get me to sell it

everyone's like yeah you probably get

you know least several gold for it and I

can't do it because I never want to lose

my most precious treasure it's it's a

reminder of where I came from who I am

and what I'm capable of mm-hm and it's

something I just can't let go love I

know I've gotten I know people have

talked about me with it or giving me

looks but I don't care it's too

important to me and I never want to lose

it I wonder if it glows keep it close I

wonder if maybe you should tell it how

important it is to you I mean it's still

here I still got it

so yeah but that's all it's like said

it's not a very interesting story but

there you go it's I found it

oh I'm I did many stories master Woodrow

there is no uninteresting stories there

are always ones that just matter to us

differently I like your story I like it

thank you for sharing with me the others

just isn't he just that one of the

smartest people you've ever I mean like

looking for treasure where others don't

that's exactly what makes it so but he

is he's like our he's like our Shepherd

you know when when I was learning all

about Lysander and how to learn his will

because you know you have to listen for

his will and interpret it right and part

of it is just reflecting and being still

and hearing his voice but sometimes that

doesn't work for all of us not all of us

can hear his voice all the time I mean

who knows he's never spoken directly to

me except that one time kind of anyway

long story but you know then sometimes

you have to look at your your problems

because he speaks to you through your

problems and the challenges and and what

he can teach you through those things

but I think most of all Lysander speaks

to us through through through what he

calls the Shepherds that the people who

at first glance they seem just like you

know a common person and a flawed person

cuz Lysander works most so there's

flawed people and and it's those people

that show you the true way by just

knowing and noticing and and helping you

see things that you didn't see before

and that's that's what did this mmm-hmm

I like that phrase I remember the

teachings of saloon they say that

moonlight highlights a broken path

easier than a perfect one yes I like

this I you know do you that I've never

said thank you to you have I thanked you

for what well I mean I mean for plenty

of things but I guess I I know how lucky

I am to have been born into the family I

was born into but I never got to really

feel what it was like to have a family

not not really and and you kind of made

one out of all of us so

so thank you oh you're welcome I guess

wasn't something I tried to do it's just

sort of happened it's uh I yeah had

never really had much family either not

once I could speak highly of well you

know where to look for it it seems yeah

I'm glad to have you around people in Oh

shucks Strix in Poulton so anything you

guys wanted to talk about while you're

out doing chores

want some beer wine you gotta film just

like getting drink in the woods is long

gone

after too much real talk with evil and

he's just like all right time to forget

why the hell do you drink so much why

the hell don't you I would fireball

someone one of these days dyrdek ass

crowd of madness on me and we're all

gonna die I wouldn't do that

you're drunk how do you know it's me or

not like holy

how do you why I'm looking at her like

do I like do it did I do it

no stop it what you would say that you

phony

don't do it thank you

makes your wine so if you get close to

oh yeah I need that no Poulsen you have

to stop drinking so much you don't need

to forget why what are you trying to

forget if well the hairs the thing it

works so I can't remember I say she'll

just start like gathering the bark on

the ground but it's just like she's

pulling way too much off the tree

where it's just like ripping chunks off

shits like angrily it's just like Paul

said do you just have to work on showing

emotion you don't like it you're you're

tearing this family apart

look I just I just I I don't it makes it

easier you know who's is it going to be

easy until one of us accidentally dies

from you casting a spell on us and not

good cast a spell on you guys

all right I like look I lose enough

people I care about without my help so

who says that like why would I do it

myself

is that why you drink so much just like

Hello mr. Frakes picks up the bark and

slams it into his chest it's like carry

this alright we only have each other

paulsen and if you don't act like they

matter then we're all going to die

like well they do and that's why that's

why I do that you know I don't know and

you're a kid and like everything's taken

from you you don't think I know that

yeah well good on you for being able to

cope in your own way you coping your way

I cope with mine there's no reason why

we need to cope we have each other all

of us we we don't need to do that

anymore and what happens when that's no

longer a factor what happens when we

don't have each other you don't know

that and that's why I'm that's why I'm

prepping because if it does happen I'll

be ready for it and you know when you're

when you're number and that

happens then you're just like it's like

it's cool man

I'd rather I'd rather be that that's not

going to happen you don't know that it

almost happens Oh mad

she's it's not gonna happen again

thinking it almost happened I was

freaking I was a freaking crow and I

watched one person I care about almost

fall to some kind of weird tentacle

monster thing and I'm not super into

that so I know it could happen

it's almost happened several times so

why not just prep for it and make it

easier she's like 10 feet away now cuz

she just ran angrily and say no you come

back she just picks up some more bark

along the way and just keep running I'm

not gonna argue with it's not gonna

happen again I was alone for 50 years

I'm never losing anyone again

do you like come running back into the

cap straights super kind of light looks

over an Easter so oh well perhaps you'll

be shallow I'll deal with the last

matters believe that to me here stare

streaks you sit down and he kind of

looks over appallingly thank you my lord

sit come sit sit

all of you sit even comes and sits next

to strikes and kind of like tries to

comfort her and she's like like you hey

she's kind of like petting her you okay

what's going on at this strix just just

like beside herself at this point just

like staring at the ground

Alden is still whining with wine not

whining why there is more wine are you

are you freaking out about losing us

again you're not gonna lose us I've know

because we're not gonna lose you you

know why because we love you I love you

have I ever told you that before I love

you I freakin love you so there and I

I've never thanked you

I hear this and I'm just like that's not

that doesn't cut it that's not enough

that doesn't stop shape from killing you

that just makes the sentiment nice for

now love's not enough that's the only

thing that's enough now when there's

freaking there's when there's literal

like gods and dev whatever like try it

you see you think you think like if a

guy oh like there's this freaking like

that that horrifying thing that I never

want to talk about again that tried to

take you was just like oh I better go

cuz she has luck no you didn't give a

 if you save me that I would have

gotten and even if you hadn't if I had

been swallowed by that thing you know

oughta transcended it loved because you

know what I want to kept doing loving

all of y'all so it's the only thing

that's more powerful than gods it's the

only thing that's more powerful than a

soul longer with or a tentacle thing

it's the only thing that really matters

and she's right I don't think I would

have survived all that time without

thinking about all of you miss trixl

like pull go into her robes and take out

three packages and she handed them to

all of you yeah that's this apparently

been and been in her robes for like a

long time so please be careful when you

open them doesn't say anything what are

these I just ate the anger tips I want

you I want you to have them because they

and there's there's contracts inside of

them I figure stupid omen could have a

contract then you should all have

contracts to I had these when I was

alone and they were my companions and

they kept me stay alive and when you

were back when you were finally finally

back I couldn't believe it

I couldn't understand because these

things were still you to me that's why I

didn't react because I I didn't

understand that you were back but after

we after we killed the mercy killer I

knew that I wasn't going to lose you

I wasn't gonna leave you guys we was

having a lot of trouble opening upstream

which are like constructive fingers so

she kind of like pulls it out to you for

help

well Paulinus welfare gone and knots are

like rocket science dinners off of her

rope and just be like all right okay

exciting thing you of all time you must

have some good memories of your

adventures anything that you can think

all so an exciting tidbit frode's Oprah

to carry into his last last years before

stride killed all of them first I made

the second time I threw myself at him

bodily you got my broom and smashed into

him Strickland sunny why that's so

reckless because I didn't want anyway

him to get away and for have all of you

to die and then that that's exactly what

happened but I did knock him off his

horse was a boy's house you escape I ran

away well that's a good kind of running

away not really I shouldn't have run

away no we're fine now it's fine let's

think about the exciting things we did

like like when we fought winter splinter

that was fine oh one time if she like

gets into storytelling mode was so fun

she's like one tap we met a fearsome

monster like a tree but shy and deers

what else it was like it had scary eyes

and and it made a big scary sound and

then we were like no and then he was

like rah and then we were like whoo and

then pow and then he was like and she's

like trying to tell the story but she's

looking at he has like we are in a place

called burrow via and winter splinter

was

imagine a treant who woke up on the

wrong side of the bed it was awesome ten

times the normal size is Goliath

lumbering lumber was making his way

towards well a place of innocence to

people who were surely gotten crushed

and we were only people there ready to

stop him so man this thing was massive

but even did not hesitate to just fly

right in front of it start swinging away

with our axe

paltin Strix and I rode up on horseback

and that's right we did have horses

before they all got to eat no no they're

still fine we just left them behind and

we'll go get them later

yeah this is also before everyone could

fly those were dark times yeah yeah now

we can all fly it's great it is quite a

handy talent to have business but it's

strange that more people don't learn how

to do it here in Vail yeah all right

Strix was able it was a time where we'd

really come together fright I feel like

I don't know maybe for the first time

but there's one that I knew that who we

all are and why we should be together

the way this hulking giant was honest

way to destroy everything evil and not

hesitate and just slow it down whatever

it took

Pelton supplying me basically what I

needed to make a makeshift multiple and

I was I was on the side climbing it like

an idiot and Strix threw a fireball

allow me to light it and I just threw it

in the mouth of this thing and the whole

thing blew up just an explosion of fire

of sticks and wood falling everywhere

turns out evylyn can make it effects

noises like c-3po and he's telling

stories paulten we can just before that

he he gave it a crazy look and cursed it

it was magnificent

I had never felt more proud I've every

single one of my party members just then

there's a selfish act by everybody you

know we kind of forgot about it but we

did that with the gargoyles too right

before the ritual card that was one of

the best or whatever those things were

that we're flying around and we were in

that kind of cave thing and we were like

oh right yeah you know see we kind of

forgot about that was one of our coolest

most epic we just smash them yeah I

guess I don't remember that one as well

I mean you really know remember when we

win I only remember when someone dies

well I didn't die I mean right right

after that I did I mean I think I did

die but then I came back in my son's

remade body

have you told Simon about that poulsen

she looks at him kind of nervously I

just like kind of cover Simon's ears I

mean in this strange body that the

toymaker made from scratch that was not

intended to what Zara is looking very

confused between Evelyn Paulton and

Simon as if there is some sort of

familial connection that he's not sussed

out somehow because he's robot woman and

a human man and then a small robot boy

Oh family is a strange thing

strange thing indeed very strange you

don't even know I'm very old and wise

turtle but clearly I do not clearly I do

not have you ever seen anyone like me

before I have seen not like you I have

seen creatures of metal and stone that

could move but they did not think the

way that you do I've heard tell that

there's planes a place called mechanicus

that may have creatures that have gears

and whirling came to get me oh but

perhaps that is all I've ever heard of

in my long term

that's it I hope not all of them are bad

I hope there's some good ones I think

like gold things in life you will find

that there is good and bad of all such

things perhaps except maybe demons and

devils they're generally pretty bad you

are a tiefling yes yes pilot that's hard

temple yes you have the devil blood but

you are still you yes you get to make

your own choices I hope so I think so I

do not think a demon or devil would give

such gifts to friends I think that you

are you are made of good stuff stinks

you're you're good sticks

you're the best sticks I've ever seen

and I am tired yes I think perhaps

perhaps sir we should get some rest but

can i this old turtle just give you one

last piece of advice to such young soft

shells is all of you turn yourself

shells where that is what I call you

people strange non shell types but you

all seem to be well just listening to

your snails and the things that I have

overheard you are all very good to each

other and you worry too much about what

perhaps others think do you know what my

I told my sons before I left on my own

journey

they asked me Papa what is the best step

in a journey and I said to them it is

not the first and it is not the last it

is the next one and I think that's you

will continue making those next steps

between each other and you will drag

each other at points and you will help

each other along the way but I'm sure

you will all be there for every step

that you take before you go I will give

you a little something and he kind of

pause the leftover stew and so like a

little sealed up container and he gives

the fire wine to Paulton and savour it

gives over a couple of what called fire

cloves to Strix just like these will

keep the food warm

for a few days keep yourselves well

traveled you are welcome to rest here I

think I will stay up and watch the moon

for a little I only have a few years

left and I wish to take it in as I do

but don't mind me old zopo will just be

here if you have any last words any kind

of like sooo Dalls up to a little soft

like thing little Yoda Stalag kind of

just looks up I like him can we keep him

no we're not going he's sitting he's not

a pet well I mean you guys keep me

that's different

I'm so confused I just want him to turn

the party I like him he's smart why well

he's how on his own journey

evylyn and so are you so let's not take

him away from his journey just for own

selfish reasons yeah plus we like run a

lot running palton I never wanted any

harm to come to it or do you sorry not

to it to him back to the yak village

after Simon was crushed it's not that I

I just wanted to make sure everyone's

gonna be safe and I didn't know if that

was possible with him around I was just

trying to do what I thought was right

and I saw the anger and the hatred in

your eyes and I just knit I wanted you

to know that I only was trying to do

what I thought was best for you and for

everyone I'm sorry I I can see him here

now and I see the way you guys look at

him and the way you treat him and I was

wrong

Paulding bends down to Simon and picks

them up goes say it into the microphone

come on we don't have to say he's a good

boy stop mm-hmm yeah I feel stupid do it

fine Simon I am sorry you're a good boy

turn around like a good boy put them

down yeah you don't have to kill them

anymore what what sorry I just I just

try to do what I think it's right by all

of you I know I don't always do that

correctly but I do try it's not because

it's not easy it's not that I don't beat

myself up over it is you don't I've made

a lot of mistakes look at all of us yeah

I don't think saving me in an alleyway

was a mistake no that wasn't no

definitely wasn't coz everything for me

is just a giant mistake except for

everyone here

she's like eating the soup like a crazy

person like I don't understand why all

of you look to me or look for me to me

for direction or whatever I've screwed

up a lot and I've done a lot of bad

things and I don't I don't even know if

I can ever properly you can keep us all

safe for making sure we're in the right

place

I just know no use our strikes is just

gonna like a look at me like you have to

you're the only one that can you have to

if you say we're not then we're gonna

die everyone kind of puts like a hand on

his shoulder she's like yeah I usually

know what's right I can usually feel it

but I don't always know how to go in the

right direction toward it and you

usually seem to yeah I know you're

flawed but show me a perfect person and

I will renounce everything I know about

the world I know that the Lord works

most or people who are flawed and that's

why we look to you because you said it

yourself you you know where to look to

find the good things in life the

treasures the right things

I'll keep telling you where the right

thing is and you just keep telling me

how to get there evylyn can I show you

something okay

tearful actually lead evylyn outside of

a tent and uncle Joey out there we're

not gonna die Strix holds it give me

your wine Oh God here you go

thank you she takes it really angrily so

uh death will lead evil and cop

throughout the jungle and basically try

to find a it's it's milla night yeah

mm-hmm so it's like it's super laid out

clear skies but we try to get out

somewhere in the jungle where there's a

clearing within the canopy and the trees

and the vines up above so that we can

see up to the sky and that's where Deus

will lead evylyn and after he gets there

he'll point up to them and point her

attention up that way and he'll start to

say I look at these every night all the

different stars every night before I go

to bed and they say that this night sky

is a lot like our world it's just it's

covered in darkness but you can see

throughout all of that darkness there's

just little points of light breaking

through and now each one of those points

of light in our world is places that are

safe different towns different cities

wherever people can be to come together

and be safe now they also say that

sailors went out and see when they're

lost they look to these stars for

guidance they use these to find their

way home trying to follow this light

every night before I go to bed I look at

these stars and I can tell you not one

of them shines as bright as you

I don't always know what's pretty plain

and when I don't I look to you for once

in the entire history of our game evylyn

is speechless and if she could cry you

can tell that she probably would but

instead you just see a deep glowing kind

of in the corners of her eyes and I'm

sure okay

she just holds out one hand for like a

like a warrior grip okay

and Diaz will take that and as he takes

that grip looking into her eyes he'll

say you know I still see it every time

you still see yeah even now in your

current form I still see the way you

look at paltin every time don't give the

people in eye

maybe you don't see it but I sure do and

I think well maybe I hope I think a

small part of Paulding sees it too even

if he doesn't want to admit it

don't give up evey

I know that I will never give up on any

of you for any reason ever because it's

clear to me that there's a reason that

I'm here with you and I thought at first

it was selfish of me to want so badly to

be part of this family but if I'm a

guiding light it's only because I'm in

the right place where I'm supposed to be

with all of you and you were my guiding

lights and I uh I don't know about

anything else or what I should expect or

what I should get but I know what I

should give things evylyn and speaking

of how you look at people there's

someone you shouldn't give up on either

don't pretend you don't know what I'm

talking about if there's one thing I

know how to spot it's left at this point

Deus kind of looks down in a way and his

expression con turns to a a a a pained

sadness look you've done a real good job

taking care of her so far

yeah

did I I mean it's nice to get to talk to

you like this deals we never get to

really chat very much doing no I don't

think so

thanks for those nice things you said

you really think I'm a guide in my cuz I

feel like I'm real silly most of the

time no you're you're definitely a light

well if I am you are too and don't you

get down on yourself again we can't

we're paralyzed when you feel paralyzed

when you feel scared we feel scared

you've made mistakes but we all make

mistakes

and sometimes your mistakes are what

lead us in the right direction anyway so

don't get like you got after ions like

ever again moon light coming down

highlighting the - Mary I don't know if

I can promise that but I'll certainly

try my hardest it's all anyone can ask

just as long as you don't give up on me

never and she just gives him a huge hug

like unbridled just like just a Lebanese

crunch yeah come on it was like his kind

of arms can i crush these like kinda

back you can hear the soft sounds of

Colt in the background just a few animal

sounds and things screaming of drunks

tricks oh we're getting trashed yeah

yeah what are you talking about tricks

is just trashed at this point she's like

just like drink evil I'd like rolling

around on the ground

have-have have evil and India's come

back yet or so after the

after here like the strict scream I

imagine be can you still hear that from

there so like even MDM colleague looks

back at that just almost instinctively

because he hears Strix and how looks

back to make sure it was a I'm up step

scream and not a I'm in trouble scream I

think she's fine but we should get back

and she just kind of like gives him one

more hug and she's like I'm saying that

you're part of my family did and I don't

know I don't know how really what that

means too much but I know that I will

never let go of any of you and I know

they you'll never let go of any of us

will you know I mean how long has it

been that you've I mean you've loved us

a little while but how long has it been

that you've loved Strix

since the moment I saw her eyes not

clouded with fear that happens more and

more often when she's with you evylyn

please don't tell her

why not it's just it's easier if you

don't of NDF we'll start returning back

to camp she's heading this and she's

just after I'm like what what what she

can't get any words out before he gets

back

you guys start making your way back

d/f leading the way and you kind of hear

the sounds of drunkenness tricks and

just drunk crying and hauling and you

can hear these kind of faint sounds of

the jungle behind you and it's kind of

the occasional canopy is broken up by

moonlight and you can still see that

kind of it's a very bright moon and the

stars are really kind of shining down

and the campfire is beginning to crackle

and burn down low and the heavy smell of

wood smoke is kind of filling the air

and you just kind of hear you know off

to the distance you can see Zopa kind of

still looking up at the moon and you can

begin to hear him kind of humming that

tune that you heard when you first kind

of met him it's kind of almost like a

little sea song of kind of just like my

pretty sure goes that's by the sea and

he's just kind of whistling and humming

to himself and as you kind of get back

yeah it's kind of drowned out by

denominator there where they fall quiet

you know you just hear this kind of very

gentle music on the sea and as you're

running past Zopa does kind of hold the

the cane out a little bit evylyn to kind

of stop evylyn from really like catching

up with DF just he just kind of gives a

really sort of very kind and slow smile

to her and he just kind of says it's

just like oh give what is the rush

she's like plops down next to him

she's like life is so confusing Zopa oh

yes and you do not know the half of it

I know I just can't grasp even any of it

I would say that from what I have heard

this evening and what I have seen you

cross many things but all of us must

grasp them in our own way young master

Woodrow must deal with things in his own

way like I said the most important step

in every journey is the next one but

somebody can't move your legs for you

somebody can't put you can sail the

rowboat for you you must do it yourself

and he will speak another next step

we've got a pretty big one we should get

some rest guys we're almost Oh Elmo gets

back a camp right yeah he's gonna come

back now yeah so do I do I notice that

he looks like he's been he's been a

little emotional palton rolling inside

check that that would be a 16 I'll try

it I'll try I'll roll my own bluff check

our deception yeah performance probably

yes right uh probably the kind of King

yeah keep it come out and do the same

for me it doesn't matter all right

I will look for ya you notice so I see

DF has been has been a has been very

upset I say come here come here

uh now I'm all right yes I'm not I will

I go to him mm-hmm and I put my hands on

his face and I lean my head against his

huh I'm just like I'm sorry but you and

me will never happen

I just gave him a little rustle and then

I just like from there like without even

stepping away I just slowly like drinks

has already passed out by the way she's

probably just like buy waffles just on

the ground like snoring you know I hope

it comes up and puts a blank over

strikes he's just kind of lightly

there's like really warm sea salt

smelling blanket she loves it

this seems like the best time to end

okay so he covered strict blanket and

even kind of see he's just like how

tenderly and wisely he's dealt with all

she's like what was that song you were

singing that showgirl song oh that is

the song that we and my my life mates

used to sing when we were younger and he

just kind of looks nice just like she is

going to join saloon already which is

why I'm taking my last trip of course

where I have I have nine children and

four grandchildren all have grown up as

totals on their adventures even like

flutters down and like sits cross-legged

in front she's like tell me everything

what's it like having a life mate I will

tell you let's let the others get to

sleep I imagine that you do not need it

as much and I will tell you about her

and I would tell you about our children

and their adventures and he just kind of

as the I'm guessing maybe like deaath

kind of sells in Poland's already

collapsed and you base DF kind of fears

the last kind of fragments of the

stories he begins telling

evylyn all about his his wife and his

children and things like that and yeah

like in the evening does evylyn sleep I

can't remember she can shut down okay so

so Paul would probably like encourage

you to do that and basically kind of say

why don't you go check on master Woodrow

and then you kind of in the evening and

then basically when she becomes aware

and the rest of the party kind of wake

up

Zoop was gone the blank is still over

Strix and there's just a walking though

the stick that he was kind of fraud in

he was like bashing evylyn with and kind

of pointing and gesturing with it's

still there and you can see it's carved

with all sorts of sea creatures and

monsters and you know different place

names and all different languages and

there's just a single kind of piece of

paper which writ is written on it is

just the most important step is the next

one and then that's that's basically he

leaves that amongst the camp and there's

the stew still remaining and I think

there as you said that's a good point

for today's episode to wrap up I think
