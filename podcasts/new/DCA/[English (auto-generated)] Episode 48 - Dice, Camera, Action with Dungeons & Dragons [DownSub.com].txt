Alton will be played by a Jew

oh hey Dave there you there's three

chairs laid for me just in time

intros going oh snap might be

what if somebody carries it I just moved

here Oh Jerry wants to sit off all of

his imaginary friends over tonight

because this stream is brought to you by

deep no it is not now that is weird huh

oh you guys don't have a redirect from

WotC to didi or three two hi everybody

and welcome to dice camera action hey

hey lamahieu yeah hey I came in late so

when last we left the waffle crew they

were in the minds of iron slag having

escaped from the clutches of Duke zalto

and his confederates with the aid of a

suspicious brow stranger named Couzens

or lauren why why suspicious why I mean

spider tattoo the spider catch you on

your face I can't help that edges and

they did it by crawling up a chimney and

getting sit and crap all over them but

then they blocked the top of the chimney

to prevent pursuers from following

thanks in large part to Strix is giant

strength which is now dissipating

rapidly and they also have an

opportunity to take a rest a much-needed

rest after their harrowing exploits in

the depths of iron slag now what are

they doing in iron slag you ask it's

very simple they were sent on a mission

by the Dwarven king horn off to find out

what the heck the Giants are up to I

thought a stealth mission would be the

way to go a recon mission things didn't

quite play out that way but they're all

still alive um and uh now they've sort

of reached with information given to

them by cozen a a dire choice having

completed their mission and found out

that the Giants are building a Colossus

to basically unleash and lay waste to

their enemies they can return to Citadel

Adam are to tell hornoff what they've

learned thus completing what he asked

them to do but on the other hand there

are piles of slaves trapped in the

depths of iron slag all those prisoners

moreover Gozen has told them that noobs

Aalto plans to use um plans to release a

fire primordial that the drow have

delivered into his clutches and trap

this primordial in a furnace an

adamantium Forge using it to assemble

the Colossus and Couzens also told them

that the heart of the Colossus can be

theoretically melted down by this

primordial triggering a catastrophic

explosion um so as we begin tonight's

session as we begin tonight's session

the choice facing the party is go back

to Citadel add bar or use the heroic

thing yeah options really define heroic

thing down or option 3 is pick a

direction and walk and don't yeah right

yes slow off everything start a new

campaign just let's keep walking just

know what guys nope Lal diem we leave

and go to Disney links yes someone also

take care of it someone's gotta um now

did we actually take an actual rest

slash get the benefits of a rest so now

is the time to talk about that uh if you

take a chart if you take a short

one-hour rest you can spend any hit dice

you have remaining to regain points

or since some of you I think are

stripped down to the bone when it comes

to your spell's and whatnot you know

everyone you might yes even dia has run

out of spells Dingle right and that was

important last week because you thought

that might be a way to survive a

cataclysmic mountain collapse mm-hmm

still keeping that in mind just it's on

the table didn't survive it but then

escaped it mhmmm the good news is you're

not only in the presence of a very

helpful benevolent drow buzz all smart

also a figure that you were kind of tan

gently looking for a dwarven war hero

named Jasper dimmer Kasim is also in

your present midst and he has some

clerical ability he's been very quiet

since his rescue um but is willing to

offer any aid Jasper how did you get

yourself into this mess he tells you in

short um he's not a talkative fellow

that he was leading a patrol that

encountered some giants who were digging

up a relic in the snowy hills and they

decided to get as close as they could to

find out what the Giants actually had in

their possession and were ambushed they

were they were jumped and captured and

dragged back to iron slag to serve as

slaves in the mines and the forge Jasper

tried to petition Oh actually they were

captured by the Yak volke first Jasper

tried to petition for the release of his

crew and the Giants would have none of

it hmm was this a black folk village so

they were brought to the AK folk village

and some of them were left with the Yaak

folk and others were taken down into the

mines and to the slave pens right well

we can at least inform him that his

allies in the Yaak folk

for let free I except for a certain

speleothems set free and that's at

roughly at that point what Jasper like

notices that evil ins gots Helio the

sword and he's like that's that looks

familiar that belonged to one of my

retinue it's sure did

bless her heart

dude you tell him that's B Leo for died

fighting the act folk yeah I say you

know the the truest beauty in life lay

down yourself for others and to leave a

legacy of of beauty don't you think so

Jasper Jasper concurs stretch soldiers

yell she's Dan shells hadn't known her

hand saying give her sword to the

nearest paladin when she died

yeah this weird that she planned that

out

we had a real special connection that

does sound a lot like her yeah we need

to rest

badly otherwise there's no way we're

gonna get out of here because I'm

assuming that we're going to go fix this

problem right is this I mean I'm not one

to to wait before running headlong into

a situation oh we know

but but don't you think we could maybe

send for Oh for something I mean us

against an elemental the dwarfs

ratchet-ass burg uh he says i don't want

to get in the middle of your discussions

but if you're asking my advice i think

based on the threat level and the fact

that they know we're still here

it could be suicidal to go back down

into the forge now no we mean what he

sort of shakes his head and says a hot

die I don't know how that looks around

strength is just like it's magic

oh pretty sweet huh teen a magic hot I

mean I even certainly think it sounds

like a great idea to rely on the light

of a sander and just run headlong but I

could see how someone who is not evil

and would think that that was a horrible

idea and maybe shouldn't be done at all

I'm I'm already assuming that we're

gonna die hey I mean we can't even get

out of here as I mean weird it we're

dead at this point

like I've rescinded into that I mean

maybe with that attitude I always have

that attitude

exactly oh is it always like this

it's always like this like I feel like

maybe I was a little too hasty in

choosing betray my kinsmen folder yeah

speaking of chosen we have a few

questions for you hmm

yeah you see a bird outside yeah oh okay

good just making sure they're still

there yeah he was yeah it play a very

very key crucial role in our escape not

a doubt good mm-hmm

it's good that he's still out there then

good same chosen you were part of this

team that delivered this fire primordial

I was with my cousin beerus do you just

have the one primordial are there

multiple just the one in the flask

Megara yes so I hope you want to reveal

this but you and your confederates stole

it from the Dwarven stronghold of Gothel

grim oh god I hope they didn't steal

anything else

well oh we'll do it we'll just keep that

under the cap yep so this primordial

that they need for this furnace to get

their classes online there is only

there's only one just this one that's

available and for some reason they don't

have this primordial they cannot

get this Colossus online they need only

they need the heat of Megara that's the

only thing that's big enough that will

repeat that will allow the Colossus to

function so if there's no Megara

there's no Colossus no Megara no

Colossus but Megara is also the only

thing that can destroy it all right do

we have to destroy it or can we just

maybe acquire it I mean so long as it's

not functioning so long as it's not

capable of rampaging out into the

countryside destroying the dwarves who

hired you and enslaving anyone who's

still alive yeah you probably find a

little-known fact you would know this

Mosin is there was a time in the history

of the realms when mogera what was that

where mogera almost escaped mmm she

thanks to some intervention slipped

three slipped free of her bonds

undergone toll grim and rampaged and it

triggered the volcanic eruption of Mount

hot now which nearly destroyed the city

of Neverwinter I am going to relay that

information to my companions hopefully

as a means of indicating how very

serious it is that that mega mogera

should be prevented from running loose

also it's clear that a creature of this

size and strength can't be tamed very

easily

Duke's old salto might be having some

trouble binding it to his service but

given time he will and the Colossus will

wake and kill everyone

right everywhere kill everyone kill the

lucky ones the unlucky ones will survive

to be enslaved the fire Giants Empire

will grow and yeah that'll be a problem

and have we have we looked into now hear

me out potentially befriending this

Colossus it's a construct because things

that we become friends with tend to die

real fast so that might be the easiest

course of action alright Alton's real

good with constructs mm-hmm great track

record mm-hmm

I quietly take a moment to reflect on

this information that people who

befriend these people die Jasper who's

been silent up to this point his eyes

just get wide I just kind of stare out

into the darkness for just just long

enough and then comfort Jasper and be

like well we're dead already everyone's

dead or we're all dead I don't don't

worry um I I don't consider us friends

yet so you're fine Oh next question for

you Couzens hmm

you were here to deliver this fire

primordial it was clear that from your

companions that was your one goal that

is why you're here and then suddenly you

would against that directive explain

yourself I am NOT interested in dwarves

and I'm not interested in fire giants

and I'm not interested in what happens

past this mountain seeing my cousin fail

I am very interested in I believe

oh that's why don't you like your Khan

cuz they're drow we don't like anyone

related to them do you like me like you

I give evil in a week why one of those

famous cause in Georgia yeah and we're

dead so what you're saying is that's

better so what you're saying is if for

whatever reason we get this fire

primordial prevent it from being used on

its Colossus that will cause your cousin

to fail and that's really all you want

in life

oh I want more than that but I don't

want anything that we don't both want

ie to stop a colossus from destroying

everything I mean the big question is

we're gonna go back down the chimney or

not I don't think I'm strong enough to

get us back down the chimney again look

we only need to obtain the flask itself

right so long as the flask is out of

zoltan's power he can't bind Megara

wouldn't have to sleep sometime we could

go on a stealth mission Shrek's is just

gonna start crying laying the ground

right gonna try and rest well everyone's

talking me absolutely dry her tears with

Jasper's beard yeah yeah exactly

what'd you do with the flask after you

have it doesn't interest me give it back

to the dwarves if you want keep it for

yourself I don't really care blow up the

mountain that's fine so long as it's not

in the hands of the Giants there it

fails cozen succeeds no one dies no one

who we don't want dead dies Jasper if

you were got yourself outside of this

mountain would you people find your way

back to civil to the lab bar oh yeah

easily and I'll take with me anyone it

wants to come along

what wonderful even her

he points districts mean to me I give

her a hug don't

[Laughter]

well it seems very clear that we need to

rest either way should we do that first

uh yeah you guys like still super

injured I'd imagine

I'm not injured yes and covered in soup

and don't worry I'm not wearing any

armor and you should put that back on

yes tricks could you give us some quick

precipitation and maybe okay I'll clean

everyone else up clean everyone up

reluctantly except for myself okay and

watch I'll just like add some more dirt

um that armor the magic armor is gone

right yeah that was shed by a crack once

again down on the foundry floor down the

assembly hall and left there but you do

have your own armor

I missed that armor don't we all some of

that all right Jasper says he's happy to

stand watch while you rest although he

looks pretty bad beat the - I

really need to rest

oh I am actually a ok well fancy you

that's really nice of you alright you

stand watch I'm going to sleep and even

lays down exactly where she is

ok do what you need to rob restore your

runes Jasper anything you could do to

help heal them would be great you guys

can get back some of your magic powers

awesome you'll need back need that for

your trip back to add bar as soon as

you're ready all of you go I'm going

back to the final no no stops walking no

no you're not doing that by yourself

that's ridiculous I'm the only one who

can I guess a cloud paltin can go

invisible yeah and we did that the first

time we showed up look what happened we

got into this mess

you're gonna spoil a look at evylyn

she's sleeping you're not wrong

evylyn can't come every time she doesn't

it ruins everything

oh is it because when she walks it

sounds like this hi it sounds like this

[Music]

but not it doesn't I can turn into a

cloud I can turn you into a cloud we can

escape through anything you can't grab a

flask of a cloud it'll turn into a cloud

when it's on you as long as you're

holding it it also becomes a cloud it's

a cloud but it's like a cloud of

everything with the cloud like you're

not just naked when you unclouded that

would be really unfortunate just saying

yeah I like you when she's gonna fall

asleep and closer years ago dude we

already tried one stealth mission and

last I checked all three of you almost

died I can clear no cloud I'm fine I

can't turn to a mammoth anymore though

sorry dude you can ruminate about that

wall strikes goes to sleep look I know I

can do this a point I feel I should

share since we're friends and all

wink wink um you if there was just fire

giants perhaps but Varys knows about our

treachery now chances are she knows that

the fate of her test hangs in the

balance so she'll probably be looking

for us oh I'm a soul on the ground when

you do it well you know we could go get

the slaves and free them maybe I'm sure

evil it would love that

did you I'm ready to run

at any point i'm literally ready to run

away I've just you know I just figured

since we're already dead there's no

reason to run because it'll just be more

death right well while you're talking

waffle seems that found a way out of her

harness and is coming over just to sit

in your lap cap damn it oh I was telling

her oh I sleep well there's like Pat

waffles like well we have to get waffles

out of here because I don't want this

little owl bear exploding in this

mountain right

I'm sure Jasper was able to safely get

waffles back what do you think Jasper

all excited I am um he the dwarf sort of

looks and kind of furrows his brow and

tilts his head it's like not really

understanding the significance that you

place upon this creature but he says

yeah sure oh I don't believe you think

sure isn't good enough Jasper I want

some snacks or something it's a help

entice waffles oh yeah Wow or simpler

yet just go with them

I'm not going with them and what go back

down there you'll probably die again I'm

not I can be a cloud all bears are quite

dangerous you know not this one they're

like wizard experiments gone awry I'll

just like squash waffles face just make

me not this one not that anyone asked

but the idea of a stealth mission isn't

terrible it seems like you guys seem to

fail more when you're all together Oh

[Laughter]

against laws of party dynamics but

there's also the idea that a distraction

could always benefit so perhaps

if this human eye gesture daddy F goes

for the flask while the rest of you i

gestured to the other humans or and the

human with horns IRA go

I caused some problems he might stand a

better chance that's something I could

do I could cause problems sure can if

you guys can get to the front large

doors and get those open that at least

provide a place for me to escape after I

grab the flask because getting in isn't

the difficult parts get to getting out

and after using this chimney something

tells me they're not gonna let us do

this again Oh probably not evil and make

a perception check 15 um as you're as

you're sleeping uh fairly lightly near

the your the rock that covers the

chimney you're awakened by what appears

to be the sound of something in the

chimney shaft underneath the rock you

heard what you thought and this is why

it sort of caused you to waken

momentarily with a start a swear word

[Laughter]

and ER and he realizes like it must have

come from something underneath or the

rock plug that you put on top of the

hole did I recognize the voice or

anything um it it sounded kind of a

little bit sleazy um its sleeve up yeah

but you don't recognize the voice now

there is someone underneath the rock

trying to come up here already

those over at Couzens don't look at me

ma'am uh and they said I mean if she

identified it as a swear word it's

probably not feareth no it's probably a

Sabbath Sabbath yeah is he one of mine

he's one of yours

I don't know he swears like a like you

wouldn't believe

all right um I asked her to describe the

voice to me it sounded kind of sleazy

now that I'm one to judge does that jive

with what I know about that ass uh well

um you're not you're not really sure uh

the frame of reference is um I mean I

mean it's approaching a Sunday yes I'm

down to guess no matter what I said I

don't leave early you know that the none

of the drow none of your fellow drought

would have any problem scaling the shaft

hmm which would be too small for

anything like a giant well uh I go to

the bottom of the rock and I say I heard

that are you sorry for saying that are

you good or bad give this up

awesome you get no response awesome

I think we should probably kill it yeah

it said it's not sorry it has to be I

sit on top of the rock just to make sure

that okay perfect adding adding to

whatever 50 tons of weight to the 3500

I'm carrying a lot of weapons most my

weight is from the weapon true enough

I glanced at DF and say if it is one of

mine he's he knows we're here now and

he'll report back to Varys who will

report back to the Giants things are

gonna get ugly or we kill him

I would probably kill it always you can

move this rocket in capture room it's

fine to capture torture you know we we

love capture capture and not torture

right huh all right I can rock all right

all right right or or we just get out of

here one less growl is one less problem

and one less problem in between you and

the flask all right everyone up take

positions elin move the rock as soon as

he gets out of here we jump um do

everything you can to subdue him okay

and by this point you have not fully

rested right okay Rex is still sleeping

she hasn't woken up yet Strix I know

you're fake sleeping get up I did no I'm

not thankfully but she sighs I did put

my armor back on okay as an FYI and as

soon as I get a chance I'd like to

attune to the heart of Spinelli okay

that'll take you about ten minutes so I

can't do it now but I'll I'll do it as

soon as we have another ten minutes okay

yeah I'll say I'll say enough time

probably passed you could have taken ten

minutes to attune by now okay yeah are

you guys ready she gets in like a

football stance hey jerk sounds like no

spells left so she's just gonna like

hold her staff like she just gonna whack

someone with it all right ready three

two one Leonard make a strength athletic

chick oh no eleven ball you could yell

oh sure I'll try to help all right look

you're probably the strongest so the

rest of us

what is paltin strength by the way ah -

1414 Wow okay yeah you can help

absolutely so if you want to try again

Anna and you have advantage oh and

Jasper can help too

he's a strong door oh that time it's 20

okay

yes you paltin and Jasper push against

this rocket grinds across the floor

leaving an opening leaving leaving

visible the shaft underneath about half

of the shaft and then Jasper sort of um

walk backs off so he doesn't fall into

the hole um as you can short little legs

and then when you look down the shaft

you can see it's dark and city like

you'd expect it to be but there is no

drow waiting for you

he's invisible probably we can do that

he probably can too

yeah wasn't someone gonna jump right

down there

I can do it evylyn no so it's a pretty

narrow space right it's a it's a five

foot by five foot square hole that

you've probably only partially uncovered

but can easily fit down with abundant

hand holds it was sort of rough hewn out

of the rock you know that it drops down

about 20 feet and then slants at a 45

degree angle mmm and we can we can

definitely uh can we see the chimney

itself or is it just completely

impenetrably black no you can see that

in your light you can see the chimney

alright so he's not he's not using right

and you can see that there's evidence of

like in the soot on the walls was

removed in the places where you guys

climbed up if you weren't flying like

evylyn you can still see your handholds

and whatnot anybody who cares - can see

if there are any new hand holes that

will require to require a perception

check I would like to do it Koston what

was the Browse name again this is a cop

Zehra Zehra I'm sorry they all sorry to

me yeah yeah you can see evidence of a

new set of handprint slash footprints in

the suit on the on the walls yeah I

whisper to the ass you have anything you

can throw down there anything that might

throw a rock that I already had in my

hand down the chimney right as he says

that okay okay good that's that's great

okay she toss a rock down as she does

not just toss like I like chocolate

right as she does that I'm gonna do what

my I'm gonna do some I guess like I

don't know what I could use

just like my best French accent isn't

just saga we are a

oh here huh I have caught them we come

with the French to the crow and try and

convince him that his sister is up there

uh yeah I I add to that it's I I scream

and curse

alright convincing her that that's hoped

to sell the storm cat uh also DF you

noticed as England hurls the rock down

the shaft that the handprints and

footprints left by this new creature

doesn't look like it was grabbing hold

of I you know on ledges to purchase or

anything but just flat hand prints but

prints like he was literally spider

climbing on the walls mmm um relay this

information to Couzens you guys don't do

that right uh oh that you can't but

feareth is a mage Varys is a mage she

could have cast something on him yeah

you actually know that she has the

spider climb spell right so she probably

did and you know not to put a damper on

it but she's probably cast some other

helpful stuff on him indeed she has uh

so Anna you cast the rock down just roll

a d20 for me you hear it Clash hard

against the stone about 20 feet down

then go tumbling down the shaft 14 okay

um uh you hear clatter

clatter clatter become more faint as it

goes you don't there's no like oh he

right exactly

as the rock is cast down but it goes as

far down as you can imagine it goes um I

might have to miss I know you're there

and then Strix you've got a deception

Jackson just roll a straight check I'm

not going to give the advantage that you

would gain from Couzens helping you is

countered by the disadvantage of beareth

not being a complete idiot Oh No uh hold

on a check I think I got yeah that's

only uh nine okay that's about a nine

accent but I did that's up you

get no response from down below I try

yeah um what if I do

does uh I have fairy fire and dancing

lights can either of those interact with

a theoretical invisibility spell um like

if you're saying can I cast fairy fire

on like in the fairy fire is a like an

area that you sort of drop it in and

anything that's invisible will light up

within that 20 foot cube hell yeah and

you can cast that as far out as you can

see which would be 20 feet down

basically encapsulate this whole

vertical section of the shaft it had

another feature that is exactly what I'm

going to do if okay nothing's there we

can rest and I can right yes you cast

the spell you light up the area and

reveal that there is no invisible

creature within range of your sight

cool cool well that was extremely useful

what I did yeah that's good to know

well now we can all risk you know

clearly whatever creature was up here

cursing at the plugged shaft has

descended back down into the shaft

possibly because someone

yell at him perhaps I mean I'm just a

guest character that might all I want

how long do you need to recharge get

back any kind of spell casting abilities

I can do it once per day so long arrest

I think yep yeah but the we can be

invisible in the hut right uh

you're invisible does it doesn't it hide

you or you can me couldn't make that you

can make the huddle Paik yeah so um just

actually be in a little darkness area so

technically we could make it opaque and

then also put a silent image of a rock

over it in a corner and then no one

would see us there is being a mage she

might be able to look maybe she's a bad

beige I mean she did almost kill us

hey y'all you're also asking for a lot

of time that we probably don't have you

said this primordial is volatile and

difficult to control

oh yeah hmm that's why I Zoltan needs to

bind it in her I'm sorry how exactly

does this binding work that I couldn't

well I don't know that do I Chris you're

not exactly sure um somehow he's got to

get the he's got to get mogera from the

flask into his adamantine Forge if the

adamantine Forge itself is a receptacle

he could probably just open the flask

inside the forge and trap her inside it

your best guess my best I you know if if

he can just dump her inside it we'll

know soon enough because we'll all be

dead okay it's not like a ritual or

anything that takes times just uh it

could be you don't know it could be I'm

not the mage damn it Strix do you know

anything about it

ah I can try

I'll do narco no Jack yeah you were in

the assembly area where the Colossus was

this does have the big adamant

in forge in it so use at least saw it

you didn't inspect it but you can make a

Arcana check all right Wow 14 you're not

sure all right I don't know this is that

this is out of my pay grade David do I

get paid snacks well we just I don't

have any spells we can't even escape

unless we rest we have to rest

I don't think sleeping in here is gonna

be that great of an idea clearly no room

they know we're here

I mean there is a hut right I really

like your huts hugs also pretty easy to

see they can see it but not much else

first things first we need to find your

neck sit out of here see if there's a

way to actually gets out of the mountain

first okay else we can at least get

Jasper on his way along with waffles

we'll meet up with them later that

sounds good and once we get to the

outside then we can send a distracting

force to the front door try to get to

know them that well myself goes tries to

sneak in and obtain this flask and or

stop whatever's there doing hopefully as

much injuries as I caused you the

Duchess maybe that will give them some

priority I want to focus on helping her

before this damn forge of his she is

missing her fingers yeah between myself

and evil and she's not doing great

nope that's true as long as we're sure

that all those slaves aren't gonna be in

danger while we while we wait because

otherwise I'm just gonna jump on down

there and start saving TP they are not

in danger they are fine yeah they're

fine Evelyn Jasper will actually echo

that sentiment and say that it seems

that while the dwarves while the

prisoners aren't directly involved in

the reforging of the Colossus they have

been making weapons and armor for the

fire Giants and the fire Giants seem to

rely on the slaves to do a lot of that

grunt work so yeah so they're they're

not that expendable right still they're

gearing up for something alright yes so

where do I go now outside whichever way

outside my own the distraction force yes

I love that so I start I can help with

that yeah

teammates yes tricks evylyn paulten

you're gonna be on the distraction force

myself chosen yeah sure why not

meaning I would rather I'd like to be

there to see it all crumble I start

making up a jingle and I asked Paulson

to help me for distraction force and

force Dana Dana near he I assume does

not oblige I'm rusty I've been on the

backlash but just one just afterwards

they take air after every line wait wait

okay do another distraction line did a

destruction force good cousin I know you

clearly have some sort of magical

ability I saw the darkest you put out

there that could be integro as we make

our escape whatever you guys need to do

to get those fire giants to open the

door you do it so we don't get to rest I

mean I think it's gonna be part of it

because unless unless you guys are up to

full you're not gonna be able to do much

my abilities my spell like abilities are

spent so I won't be able to use them

without rest either so we just need to

find a place to hide breasts I'm good at

that right so start digging if smoke

came up this way the smokes got to go

somewhere which means there must be some

kind of exit on the mountain from here

so we need to find where that goes

let's go I start going toward the

nearest like exit chimney thing any kind

of a feeling kind of Bree

are the air getting cooler along any

kind of the directions we're using as a

guide to help making sure that we're

going to correct the correct pathway

because if there's two of them there are

two exits yes yeah yes and you can see

one of them on closer inspection has

more evidence of like smoke passage than

the other great we'll follow that one

okay when you head out you find this

cave that you're in connects to what

appears to be a long abandoned or long

spent mine complex and as you navigate

that complex

I like whoever is doing the navigating

which sounds like dia dungeon delver yay

yes I'm going to make a to make a wisdom

survival check for Dragon it's not evil

and who's singing yeah Moulton is use

the castanets if there are secret doors

or traps or whatever I don't know okay

hey I said wisdoms revival wisdom

survival yeah ten okay so once you start

getting out into the rest of the mines

it's easy to become disoriented but one

thing you're able to pick up on

immediately death is there's a definite

sense that some of the passageways

sloped upward and a definite sense than

some of the passageways sloped downward

and you know going downward will take

you back down probably to the foundry

and going upward will probably take you

back up near the Yak Ville village um oh

great and it doesn't take a you know a

brain surgeon to figure out up or down

so if you are you leading everybody kind

of an upward area or are you just trying

to find a closed-off area of the mines

where you can hole up

I feel like trying to get to the outside

area first okay yeah let's also can

prestidigitation like cover tracks or

something cuz i I want to like cover our

tracks behind us yeah you could

essentially use it like ass like a

little broom just sort of sack did you'd

be like walking backwards like finger

gun images absolutely I'm covering our

jacks yes you're in the back rank just

covering tracks yeah as you go I'm doing

your best and a DF at a certain point

you get out of this nickel

did section of the mine complex where

nobody's worked for a while you break

into a tunnel that has mined tracks

which signifies a more um you you may

have actually been in these parts before

or during your initial descent and

there's your chalk marks well I was just

gonna say you stumble upon a chalk mark

I see that and I say son of a is

the one that says Lysander sucks and

following the chalk marks you can make

your way back out and along the way you

can see branches of the minds that have

distant echoey sounds down them of the

click-click of clatter clatter clatter

of sounds like people using X and stuff

others are just dark foreboding and

silent and don't look like they've been

used in years and a few of them are even

boarded up to suggest hey these might be

dangerous but as you follow your own

path that you chalked out you do

eventually make it without encountering

a soul to a stone spiral staircase that

you recognize leads up to a small

chamber uh that a that is a butts or is

next to the big top of the elevator

shaft and you crawl up that spiral

staircase and yes you are now looking

through an archway out into the top of

the elevator shaft that was rendered

non-functional waterwheel shattered and

it's a big spacious like room about 80

feet wide or 120 feet across with an 80

foot diameter shaft hole in the floor

that has this big sort of iron apparatus

above it to basically suspend the

pulleys and chains everything else that

the winches that were used to activate

the elevator there is two exits from

this chamber one is the hole in the wall

with the gear mechanisms that led up to

the waterwheel that you destroyed the

other is the proper exit which are the

giant doors that stand open leading out

into the AK folk village

so you are now you are now at the top of

the complex Oh where's Aaron the light

of the morning Lord nothing like it yes

time and it is nighttime the evening

light of death morning Lord and it's

actually very very cold um you can hear

through the open doors uh the blowing of

the wind and actually some snow is

blowing in with a roll

well that's not like we haven't seen

that before

are there any buildings left Lueck Volk

village uh

you can smell the sound the the the

burnt wood smell lingering outside there

are no active fires you'd have to walk

out into the village and because it's

just black out into the village to

actually see if there are any structures

that remain okay yeah well well lead

them to back to the yak folk village

looking for any standing structures are

mostly standing structures that are

walls up okay I glanced around and asked

what the hell happened here there's like

this when we came here oh okay I'm so I

believe that yep yeah you didn't see

when you go out into the actual village

that all of the buildings are just burnt

out shells other roofs burnt off pretty

quickly because they were made of straw

and grass and stuff and so there's no

effective shelter left out here um

that's all right as long as we got some

kind of walls or anything you can just

three out of four walls of a room

whatever just something that we can put

the hut itself instead we're still

protected from sight and possible

elements or attacks okay it's not a hot

all right so the you want it there's the

central hot which was the largest it

used to be they yak folk Chiefs Hut what

the naked elves with the naked L that

has the naked elves in it it's got the

highest walls most of which were

fashioned from clay and are still more

or less intact

see where's that bird wasn't he hanging

out around here

yeah you don't see any signs a big bird

you might miss I got her went home

yeah all big bird yeah yeah don't don't

do that least least super-helpful

no he's he's sleeping you're sleeping

you're gonna disturb him he's going oh

did you be nice

did you guys talk he's a man of few

words it's fine I got hurt I'm waking

waking him up asserts my dominance so we

need to figure out the hierarchy it's

still like a relatively new thing what I

think you're I think you're at the top

just a just on going off instinct Chris

do I have a way to call this bird do I

know do I know what to do uh you knew so

you were with harsh nag long enough to

figure out how he called the bird which

was with a whistle now he's a he was a

frost giant so when he whistled it

carried like nobody's business but you

are a skilled Bard

you feel like you could easily try to

imitate that whistle um you just have to

make it performance check to do it okay

will do I will do that performance check

to see if I can summon my bird okay also

it's cold out here okay we want

the height I'll keep that in mind but

first I will try to find bird hold on

Paulton maybe we shouldn't do anything

loud yeah tension getting yeah yeah

that's but I want my bird

that's your bird watch this bird yeah

he'll be waiting for you in the morning

we'll get the bird when we're not trying

to get the Giants to Occulus if you

summon the bird now while everyone's

hunting for you it'll put the bird in

danger why don't you want me to call my

bird I am afraid of birds and you know I

look at him I'm just like yeah yeah you

seem like the type

all right we can wait till morning

nothing else when you needed a

distraction that's when you bring your

Eagle friend in good okay you all

registry yeah count on that distraction

we'll plan on having that canceled team

distraction will rely on the birds okay

because I feel confident and summoning

this bird uh-huh once we need a

distraction I will call the bird and the

bird will come to and it'll be great

I don't mention this out loud but I do

think it and make a mental note that

reliant they are relying on the bird for

a critical part of that plan I sort of

factor that in what I know right well we

I don't see the problem with that so no

I don't work with you cool astok all

right nothing can go wrong with that

absolutely all right Beck no hot it's

called balton but up Hut coming up uh hi

all right you cast the spell inside the

burnt-out shell of the Chieftains Hut

and when the hut appears around you and

palton to just the temperature

everything is just absolutely

comfortable II you probably actually

spent a couple minutes clearing the snow

that's accumulated out of the way so

you're not like sleeping on a pile of

snow when the Hut appears yes and

actually there are some cushions that

survived the fire in the Chieftains Hut

you two probably dig those out and have

them in the hut with you um that appears

so cozen you marvel as paltin casts the

spell and this dome of force appears

around you and suddenly you're in

temperature controlled environment oh

yeah I do never seen a hut before

yeah Jasper's marveling marveling at it

as well says well I never was evil and

it shows them around this is our hut you

can see here's the middle and those are

the sides no corners it's a circle

palton likes to keep it nice and warm he

also has some nice light kits to set the

mood paltin do you want to show them any

of your nice light kits

oh I mean uh they're so nice I guess if

we're asking like wha

like a freaking strobe party I smile and

nod appreciatively uh using my high

charisma to disguise the fact that my

eyes are glazing over done and done

alright and so you settle into yacht

even goes to sleep hungry distraction

forces jingle force no no no no rest is

what you guys need will be protected in

this Hut uh for the first hour or two

while everyone is resting I'm going to

make just do another comb-over of the

entire village to see if there is

anything that would possibly be abuse or

a value to myself or for this mission

okay um make a perception check all

right

actually let's say yeah perception is

probably better for you than

intelligence investigation I'm guessing

a little bit yeah okay well thank you

okay is there anything specific that

you're kind of looking for uh anything

that I can use is like distracting items

I'm see for make sure for makeshift

caltrops

all right scanner uh let's see um glass

super yes any possible lost daggers are

throwing knives okay yeah you don't mind

any of those um let's see you find some

beat curtains

that's kind of not used oh we can throw

a party for the giant that's like take

them for the hut ask it's some wooden

ritual masks you find a lying amid a

debris in one area is what appears to be

a gold sensor that may have been hanging

from a ceiling at one point in the fell

uh there's a oven and I picked that up

oh you might have actually yes you did

on my character sheet yep everybody you

have that because it was pretty it was

pretty I have more blocks of incense a

sensor be jewelry and some semi-precious

stones that we took right ugly mask well

then when you're not looking Strix will

eat one of your blocks of incense what

it's in my bag

you stole it out of my pocket to eat

uh-oh you find a live Pig that didn't

get out oh I am bring it yeah ring with

us so DFB the pig will make snorting

noises at you uh how are we doing on

rations uh not great probably you can

you can certainly dig up some rations

out of the pig alright um yeah I'd

like you to make another perception Jack

okay

[Music]

what yeah eleven you are surprised by

this amazing thing I just found like

well I wouldn't expect to see this year

a friend yes

so as your as your uh you know um

transfixed by the pig momentarily and

looking around for other things and and

dig and you find some rations which is

great your friends will love you and you

are completely surprised when you turn

around and there is literally a eight

foot tall figure standing next to you

and you see that uh he's in the night

very dark ominous and looming and seems

to be made up of stone just this dark

stone shape in front of you with molten

golden eyes and he looks and he says

what are you looking for my friend dude

he any of us see this no he's off gift

is off on his own I meet his I jump

backwards and pull out the sword just

like an instinct Julie just that he says

hey it's me

yeah I give him one of these uh it says

what he says I'll give one of these and

he says crack or rather my true name is

kaha wreck but you can call me crack

this is much reformed what do you think

I don't understand what am I looking at

sorta way you are looking at a big stone

man with eyes of molten gold um he's

he's huge um hmm all right and he says

where are your friends we have work to

do yes we do and they're preparing for

it I was just trying to see if there's

anything in here that could possibly use

to help get ready that we can do to

anything in everything that we could use

for our mission usually taking his turn

excellent remarkably well and he says I

will help you if you like how do I know

your crack he says I cannot change my

form again today but tomorrow I will

show you and prove it to you okay I can

trust okay then take my word for it say

something like only crack right now ha

ha he says wharves are very useful I all

right he said I as I sometimes forget to

add that when I speak in that language

but it's all right nobody seems to care

so obviously you're not actually a dwarf

Kharak the medicine here what are you

doing here

he says as I am sure your friend paltin

will tell you what his earliest

convenience

I am here on a mission it is true some

false pretenses were involved in I hid

the truth from you that I'm here to

recover something here deep within the

arch and you're going to help me do that

for cover what do you want says the iron

column what the iron garland no yes

Junior you mean the thing that Paulding

Strix were controlling to fight the fire

Giants that's right taking it back to

city light bar where it rightfully

belongs yeah all right

why do you want it it was made by the

bronze fire clan oh the Giants they

stole it

yes that's what they did do I believe

him I'll make an inside track

19 all right I make mental note of that

yep oh I'm with you're 19 you also

notice that despite his sort of casual

Cavalier conversational tone that there

is an undercurrent of Menace that he

can't hide about um plans to do once he

gets what he wants

yeah uh so I am acutely aware of this

but I am going to play along as much

such an I'm saying though some like

bronze fire bronze fire uh there were

someone back at a bar named bronze fire

wasn't there you are perhaps we

referring to a zhan bronze fire your

friend and colleague who aid you shelter

and brought you into his home bed you

and that's very nice family here he's

had advice senior advisor to the king

so he made this golem and the fire giant

stole it that's right yes Wow all right

and I as his personal bodyguard have

been sent to get it back yeah we could

probably help us that you've already

promised some rewards just miss recon

mission but could probably get us more

if we bring back an extra souvenir all

right all right

so then what exactly do you need two

from us to help you get this iron golem

back

I made some sort of monumental

distraction nobody says nothing is more

important than this mission there's

something you're absolutely right now he

says my freedom and your continued

survival depend on it sure does how

would you like to be a part of said

monumental distraction and have some fun

with it

sure whatever

great then just just think of me as one

of your team Hey you got it this is now

getting a lot of people uh will be ready

to go in just a few hours I'll explain

to them like the front door distraction

with some of the party members uh while

myself and cozen will sneak inside and

retrieve the iron golem excellent I will

accompany you uh we're trying to do this

stealthily so I feel like your size and

strength II better off at the front door

it says we have the front door the more

distraction oh no no no you

underestimate my sneaky potential and he

says I have all sorts of abilities which

will come in handy I can make walls of

stone I can pass through solid stone I

can turn to sand I can turn invisible I

can turn all kinds of funny things um I

also have the ability to conjure

elementals

all those things are useful I am a Tau

hmm all right

you don't sleep or anything do you no

all right

well sadly the rest of us do

so if you wouldn't mind just waiting

here for a while when I was bad watch

perfect I'll go back to where the hut is

and keep them outside like make sure no

one else no one finds us if someone does

alert us right away will assist in

subduing him but the rest of us we need

to get some sleep and restore our magics

before we get back into the forge keep

even sleep Lee

hums distraction for all right um so

those of you who haven't quite not adopt

yet including probably Couzens who

doesn't sleep either

um and see this hulking figure

accompanying death back to the waffle

hut this this big stone but alas I don't

want him inside oh you just well he's

not gonna be a nod itself okay good but

he'll probably stand in the doorway of

the Chieftains work out hot yeah that's

great

so he's visible to the party all right I

don't know he's there uh you can

definitely see him okay yeah everybody a

lot so I see him yep gonna say um yeah I

kind of look at DF and du the like DF

several questions likewise so I'll enter

the Hut and then close the flap there's

no flap you're just walking through a

force sound field okay um you can darken

the inside of it so that it's not easy

to see what's going on top six windows I

did with uh mmm-more curiousness does

sound leave the hut yes David

I'm pretty sure but there's like wind

blowing outside and you know okay

blizzard conditions so

okay so as soon as as soon as I get in

um I'm gonna grab some some parchment

and a pen in like kind of lose weight

right now paltin you're awake

mmm I don't like s Turks is asleep to

Eva's definitely yeah yeah so like I'll

grab some approximate impart ringing

like do a quick scribble on there and

just kind of hold it up to paltin and

Couzens her so awake it just says things

are worse I just I see them just like

yeah same all right so then don't bug

kind of huddle in close and keep our

voices low so hopefully that they are

drowned out by the wind that is outside

so this Dow can't hear us

yeah there's also evil in sort of

snoring slash singing in your sleep it's

impossible to sleep in this hot with all

that everyone so now she sighs

contentedly

strict salal bower probably you should

that by now hey paltin so obviously I

don't need to explain anything to you

since you seem to know already hmm can I

just like kind of gather what's going on

from that yeah I love do like a quick

run down quietly to chosen and paltin

about that and how he very desperately

wants this iron golem bring it back to a

zone bronze fire like yeah oh and I'm

basically saying we cannot let him have

this iron golem whatever we can to

sabotage it destroy it or just come

forget cannot let

now take an eleven get this you have you

know assuming everything goes to plan so

you know don't count on it but nothing

ever goes plan you know if the if Megara

in the flask can meld the adamantine

heart that powers the Colossus she can

certainly take care of an iron goal and

then she's unbound and causing untold

destruction in the in the mountain so

really up to you right no matter what he

can't have that goal we were absolutely

just going to be using him and his

abilities to assist us hmm then in the

stealth part Chris would it be

beneficial for me to if I have an RA

share like the stuff I know uh that's

you you think it would be beneficial for

them to have that information so okay um

I convey the same okay so palton will

tell you that he saw a a brand or glyph

or mark inside the iron golem signifying

that it was created by clan bronze fire

and was told by kharak after he got his

lights punched out that it was given to

the Giants to cement an alliance uh-huh

and then so based off what Pelton s

guests

the golem itself cannot be activated or

moved or whatever outside of control the

fire Giants let's some with any kind of

magical ability has the capability to do

so um so because it never sound like

bait if he tells me all the adventures

doesn't sigh crack himself Clarke was

able to manipulate the skull or move

it's actually Carrick was in control of

the golem um what before he fled no he

had he had whoever activates it

essentially controls it until it's

deactivated and then somebody else can

try to activate it and control it

but he didn't Paul Tina / tricks to to

basically to remove the fire giant

override which Strix did you saw her dad

I didn't realize at the time yeah

do also they important also tells you or

remembers that it seemed clear based on

Clarke stone that he was telling Paul

tin this because he didn't think well

there was sort of an implied threat that

this is not information that the Dow

would like to see shared hmm II the Dow

sort of assumed that paltin figured it

out on his own as soon as he saw the

mark so if it's theoretically this golem

was given by the dwarves to the Giants

to some by a specific dwarf clan in some

lab bar to cement a secret alliance uh

well boys we got a traitor

yeah or you should say you have a

traitor like this

that was it this is your problem yeah I

didn't trust him from the start

either way palm thank you for sharing

the information this is final no matter

what you can't get that back if there's

someone inside some little app bar there

are far more threats here than we're

prepared prepared to deal with but if we

can at least use Kihara to help us

succeed in this one mission and take out

the iron golem at the same time then

great get everything we need to mean get

out of here we'll try well meaning to

look like we're trying but you cannot

succeed in getting that going back

so that said goodnight say right the the

rest of the night passes uneventful II

and you awake in the morning refreshed

with all your resources Oh everything's

better I can run away again

period you regain half of your spent Kip

dice feel so nice to be able to run away

again

okay by the way we wake up do we see

this yes yes you see the Dow standing

outside the hut keeping watch you can

see snow is still falling but most of

the wind has abated so the snow is more

or less coming straight down as sort of

big fluffy flakes the sky overhead is

gray clouds so once I see see him while

maybe Lee explained to his tricks and

evylyn and jazz birds like not what you

think

this is Kihara I played better known as

crack and he's actually here to assist

us remember that iron golem he just

wants that out and everything he will do

well I'll make sure that we get in here

and succeed in our mission and then she

gets the Golem boink

and that's it he's here to help do you

have something here on yes what's tricks

recognize this as a weird planar

creature that she does not trust yeah so

Strix you can make an Arcana job you

rattle through your noggin to see what

you know about Gao okay no 20

oh nice Li done so you know that Dow are

greedy malicious genies from the

elemental plane of Earth they are very

fond of gems precious metals they can

fly their lower bodies transforming into

columns of swirling sand as they do they

typically live under

or in glittering or veined cavern

palaces they never assist mortals unless

they have something to gain preferably

treasure or freedom and other races

native to the elemental plane of Earth

avoid the DAO because they're always

seeking new slaves to mine out their

maze works and they're floating earth

islands they're very proud slavers if

this one has been bound to the bronze

fire clan it will stop at nothing to

gain its freedom hmm got it I will not

relay that to my barney you also know a

few things about Dow and their magical

abilities they can glide through earth

they can summon elementals and they have

a host a raft of abilities including the

ability to translate languages magically

and to pass through stone so he's

incredibly powerful Oh on the on the

sort of Genie scale yeah he's comparable

to a genie or in a freight or I'm a reed

um in terms of strength those are all

scary but they are certainly more

powerful than you individually right all

right

Strix will not tell the party that

injustice a go which is what Strix does

when she wakes up so everything's normal

right yeah we noticed nothing this is

mostly yep good morning not even a

little bit more flailing just like a

little bit more than usual maybe some

rolling around mm-hmm okay so oh yes

this is the next morning everyone I

stood up yes skip back in there all

right so just to clarify I am supposed

to make lots of noise right and be super

distracting um something you're really

good at all right I just want to make

sure you Lin Strix paulten three of you

make your way around to that front door

and do whatever whatever noise or

distractions or explosions need to make

happen to get them to open that up you

draw them out you do

not engage you simply bring them out

don't try to fight them off don't try to

kill them don't put yourselves in that

grave of danger just draw them out in

meantime close an eye or make her way to

the inside find this primordial or the

flask and use it to destroy the heart

what about the head what about the big

guy yeah yeah I was wondering Kharak I

mean everyone big threats he'd be the

biggest threat I think her heart would

be best

making distractions at the front door

distraction boss I saw him as crack you

can handle himself against fire Giants

pretty well so him at the front lines I

think I think that's where he'd be best

okay what is it what is his opinion on

that he says but then how will I command

the iron call him well that's what

Colton and I are here for in the chaos

following the meltdown or presume in

Melbourne or at least the theft of the

flask there'll be plenty of time to

sneak in and get the iron golem okay

d/f and chosen whichever you as the

higher persuasion check make a check

with advantage I have plus 6 to

persuasion you in ok um roll twice and

take the higher result 16 okay he says I

am a little dubious about this plan yes

however since we are all friends yeah

there we and I will be able to enjoy the

company of the beautiful evylyn and the

remarkable Strix I will I will do as you

say and wait outside you'll greet the

Giants when the doors open

excellent and if I find some extra

treasure in there I'll be sure to grab

some for you too he says but if things

go awry I cannot to be held accountable

for actions my anger hold of what now I

think we are all accountable under the

ladder Lysander for our own actions into

serve the beauty in the LAT in this

world so I'm sorry I appreciate the

compliments you gave me but uh I just

can't accept that he says the laws of

mortals do not apply to me I'm not

talking about mortals I'm talking about

the morning Lord Lysander all praise and

glory be to his holy name Oh Sean's down

upon us on today the day of our Lord I

just continue are you guys hi me hi

usually you stop like no no circuses

giving up at this point I offer

helpfully that there will be many

targets for his frustration yeah don't

worry car hog that won't come to that

however I do have one more favor to ask

Lise now I couldn't help but notice that

when you were crack you had this

incredible suit of armor he says oh yes

yes now is there any way that you could

loan that to even reott Ain that and

load it back out to Evelyn having to

impervious threat to be better than just

one he says well as this is a new day

sure why don't he snaps his fingers and

the armor appears at Evelyn speech Strix

is like I never get anything cool does

one this mission is over of course I

will

attack of course of course of course

course course of course of course

deep Dahlia Glen with that armor once

you make yourself invulnerable you can

go be as destructive and corrosive and

distracting as you want won't that be

fun distraction first you want me to do

like a fireballs don't do anything no

but the explosions outside still should

still gain their attention all right I

think you should turn yourself into

strawed that's always sad it's not gonna

work they must believes I'm strong they

must own stuff that can be set on fire

that would be really dumb just as an

aside if fire Giants had like a cowboy

every time they sat down and just be on

fire well no they're just imperfect he

got that fire dries themselves aren't

made of fire so they can sit on a couch

just fine just not their flavor I'm

serious yeah I mean at those at the

least

sitting everything or hellhounds however

would almost certainly climb up on the

couch and then catch the fire catch a

dog bad dog slow jog no not again this

is why we can't have nice things

tricks I've seen you use polymorphs in

the lake you can still use those to help

quell whatever I mean I can't be

probably more for anymore not yourself

but well I can do others yeah like I

said that if you can do that and make

them into something harmless yeah oh it

can be equal to into something cute sure

okay I just asked

yeah what about we have to oh we have to

send waffles away we can't have waffles

here no she'll get lost I'm getting to

that

that church at Jasper so Jasper should

this fail we're not heard from for

however long it takes to get back to

total bad bar a lot a week or whatever

it is you need to get back and alert

your king in your king alone immediately

what exactly is happening here we're

counting on you to get back and let him

know what's going on I will not fail

with that we need you to take little

waffles she's in danger here and she'll

be much safer back at simple add bar

please be nice to waffles little meaty

waffles they've met right before we know

yeah so you spend about like five

minutes adjusting the harness to fit

around

Jasper's stout frame and you sort of

pack waffles in on them in the back of

it because the dwarf does not want what

this big fluffy all bare blocking his

line of vision so yes once you once you

strap waffles in the back of the dwarf

waffle starts like lying on his ears and

his spitting out is very good got travel

snoops

yeah Strix will go into a robes and just

like make a little bundle of stacks and

tie them up and pet waffles and be like

it'll be okay well we've been back

very good care of you

yes Jasper he was right Jasper Jasper a

war hero of the the silver marches

conflict thou hast delivering a baby

I'll bear safely back to the comforts of

his home in Citadel at bar and he says

this in this task he will not fail as he

set out and he grabs some weapons out of

the snow make sure he's got he's

bristling with things he didn't throw at

enemies excellent and one last favor

Jasper before you go I clearly have some

kind of divine abilities if there's

anything that you can use to help assist

us before we go in

dad BJ check okay yeah he cast a mass

heal spell on us didn't he he did now

that you're healed up though that won't

do you not again um but let's see oh I

know what he can do he who is going to

cast a divination spell contact his

deity Morden that is if you'll let him

speak to and and determined uh if this

is a good idea I thought yeah you'll ask

a single question concerning a specific

goal event or activity to occur within

the next seven days and get a truthful

reply so the question he asks you is is

there a question you'd like more than to

answer knowing that this is coming

directly from a trustworthy God okay so

not to Jasper because I don't want this

part asked but do I have a general idea

of how long it would take uh DS Ford to

get down to you like where those large

front doors are oh um well evylyn can

fly so it won't take her terribly long

everybody who's going down the stairs

will probably it'll probably take them

about thirty minutes to get down to the

doors okay the question that I want

answered is

in a proximate and approximately 30 to

45 minutes from now where is the iron

flask continuing the primordial Megara

inside a iron slag recognized I thinks

he has experience with being specific

okay so we're let me get the question

straight where is the iron flask that

contains mogera inside my iron sleigh

okay in 30 to 45 minutes 45 minutes is

it could in 30 right right yes where do

you expect it to be so the response that

Jasper gets back and he sort of um this

light seems to well up inside of Jasper

and kind of bleed out through his eyes

and mouth and it looks like fire like

when he does I can't do that even I the

light is inside me if you can't see it

then you're just not looking hard enough

yeah and his is more of a burning fire

where's yours more like a Holy Light

fire but and he speaks with great

authority on this matter and says mogera

is not in the flask she is in the Forge

the flask is in the drowse clutches hmm

and they are

Oh God we're gonna die on the ground and

then the dwarf looks up at you

specifically strix eyes burning like

fire and says very close and then the

fire and light just seems to leave him

and he's Jasper again I don't like your

God pick a new head and you all hear

this ah alright yes a son go right then

close the drower close your birdie

mcbird face or are you praying are you

praying to Evander here I'll help you

Darla's thandor even in your infinite

mercy ya chosen mm magar was put into

this flask how exactly was that done and

can't be done again do I do I know that

Chris yes cuz you were there umm the

flask which you took into grant pilgrim

and use it to capture the primordial uh

it is a it is a powerful like a

legendary magic item and you can use an

action to speak the flasks command word

which you would know hmm targeting a

creature that you can see within 60 feet

of you if the target is native to a

plane of existence other than the one

you're on it must make a successful

wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the

flask so I say it can be done again yeah

and only one creature can be in the

flask at a given time only one so if the

flask is empty then it could be used to

trap her again yes or the DAO you know

whatever it or any other creature that

you target that fails that save all

right I know I know the command word yes

and here's the best part you can then

use an action to remove the flask

stopper and release the creature the

flask contains that creature is then

friendly to you and your companions for

one hour obeying your commands for that

duration alright um

gets no commands it defends itself but

otherwise does nothing for that duration

not duration it just it's okay

on the off chance that I don't make it

because I hear I hear that's a

possibility I'm going to mention the

command word to DF okay

and command I don't know what you're

worried about you'll be fine sure sure

no you'll be fine but the two of us know

the command word that's twice the

chances that we'll be able to use to get

Megara back in right all I care about is

just anyway something's happened to you

I can do it or something happens to me

you can do it tricks is still running

around saying we're all gonna die and

she runs up to cozen and shakes and says

you're gonna die first it runs away I

again just look off into the distance as

though I always knew it was going to end

very good it's daylight now right yes it

is morning all right well I'll casually

also mention while tugging my hood up

over my eyes that if we're outside in

its daylight the drow will be at a

significant disadvantage since they

don't typically deal with the Sun right

how I hear this command word yeah

the command word is zerah zerah --the

yep it's also the name of the matron

mother or housecoat yeah so just start

listing off swears you'll get it

all right about first things first we

need that flask and if your allies are

nearby we have to get it back from them

someone's fine so we get ready for them

like set traps or something if they're

close I that if they're close they'll be

sticking to the darkest places they can

find yeah if they chose and you know if

they exit the way they came in they're

going to sort of pass right by you

they're going to probably now that

had to levitate spell back they'll

probably levitate up the shaft right way

out into the act folk village and then

down the mountainside working as quickly

to get back to the tunnels to the

Underdark as they can right they'll be

in a hurry they'll be distracted and

they'll be at a severe disadvantage when

they're passing by uh so will I for the

record you know I don't prefer sun-eater

yeah it seems to hurt you just like even

though you're you cover your eyes ya

know it stings and workouts yeah so you

know I give dia a gentle pat on the

shoulder and all you or mostly you

alright if you have to know where you if

you know where they're gonna be coming

from that's exactly we can set up our

ambush all right i relay that

information okay

so yeah they're going to come up if he's

right they're going to come up into the

actual village emerging the same way you

did all right

and then probably descend the stairs and

that's exactly where we can set up so

souza routes possibly chosen how mad you

think would've they would be at you

would day is like are you out kill on

sight

at this time yeah okay yeah nevermind

this uh you you I mean you saw it it

didn't go well alright that's alright

well then I'm gonna have give you a good

time could you give the fight of your

life

hmm just one request certainly if

possible try to incapacitate Bharath let

her you know rough her up a little but

if I can be alive to see it happen if

she could be alive to see it happen I

would very much like that you really

don't like that person oh no this is

pretty typical for us I'll turn back to

the party everyone got that take out the

other section here's the live if you can

if not huh all right we can do this a

Suzie obtained the flask we can do this

Strix it's good thing you got those

fireballs right

growl burn ed you're out catch on fire

so yeah there you go okay so uh where

are you waiting for them did you say on

the stairs uh probably from where

that'll emerge from the mountain as okay

so you'll be in the ruins of the act

folk village essentially hiring in the

burnt-out shell dragons don't leave them

any dark space to hide in yeah so we'll

position ourselves so the opening from

the mountain themselves will have evylyn

and I would say even in myself so this

usually come past this we can

immediately jump them and then the rest

of you from hiding amongst the ruins can

then come out blast them with your range

attacks or spells or whatever is you

have I need to get up high can I see any

place with a good foothold but I could

be hidden um yeah there's you could

essentially hide on top of the wall

surrounding the Yaak folk village near

where it meets the mountain so you'll be

up higher and you'd have some cover if

you were crouched down all right I will

go up there then okay don't let them

shoot you

their bowls are poisoned to be clear I

did an estimate armor yeah

and blade ward and you've got the armor

on yeah I put on the magic armor are you

going to activate its invulnerability

power save that for later in the day mmm

kids per day thing to be clear it lasts

for ten minutes yes right and right now

we're only expecting to fight the

drought not the bigger distraction of

the fire giants that would seem to be

what you accept so I do not activate it

yet okay um Kharak I know this isn't

quite gain to there but if possible

would you be able to assist us taking

them down so faster we get them down

fast we can get inside and get your iron

going back

uh he says sorry what three drower

coming out and we need to beat them up

but keep the one mean uh yes yes yes I

will help you with all problem thank you

very much

trust me this will go fast then as all

that we'll all right to a position and

hide okay I'd like death and evil and

since they're the ones closest to the

entrance to make stealth checks I'm

gonna give you both advantage because

you've got lots of cover um oh and yeah

it's got his hand over evil ins mouth

and second distraction for I got a 16

I'm still hmm oh this is good to have

because drama pretty perceptive all

right 21 okay um 20 jus sorry that's low

for me the three drow emerge into the

overcast day through the doors they pass

right by DF and evil and oblivious to

the danger that is about to loom upon

them and at that point the earth even

you can come out and start swinging

surprise action you ready

as we like you a slow motion likely

pounder strong it doesn't thing we're

like yeah everything slows down then

speeds right back up right everybody

roll initiative exactly that well you

guys are doing that strikes to slow

motions over the wall like and as soon

as things speed back up I roll a natural

one on my initiative yeah I'll finish

that gives me a 3 ok 3 wouldn't be a

dice camera action without it out a DF

do 2020 how'd its tricks do 18

Alton 18 oh nice and I also got 18 Wow

all right so much you're gonna act

everybody else is acting simultaneously

uh

and wow that's really weird Kirk also

rollin 18 Oh

over that time everyone roll the one yes

that clip somewhere I hope yep so Jared

you get to attack first now there one of

them is clearly the feareth the female

she is physically bigger than the two

males who are flanking her which target

would you like to go after so in the

midst of my slow motion leaved you might

click I scan does this happen to spot

this flask on any of them yes you can

see that V Roth has the flask tied off

to her belt all right great um I'm gonna

go for a smaller one on the side okay

you'll be attacking chaas really don't

know him personally and make it a girl

look I failed the trip choice so you

know again I'm good we way ohm

well hopefully this will be a little

better than a trip attack yeah okay make

your tax is this is a surprise attack it

sure is oh boy would you say I have

advantage on this attack role uh you

sure do

yes Jared so happy uh and then he rolled

25 yeah him so sisters for such a sneaky

attack hahaha I will be rolling my sneak

attack damage right when are you ever

going to be like yes I don't think it

could be like yes three one showed up

it's always that shadow just ha oh my

life it's never like a happy like I did

see uh uh total eighteen okay

that clearly deals him a nasty Grievous

wound and he calls out with surprise and

pain and you are now right next to him

Evelyn you go next because this is a

sort of a surprise round

I am wielding

the heart of Spinelli yeah and I am just

confirming what I wrote down

I have it does 2d6 fire damage if I

ignite it is that right that is correct

and I can only ignite it once no you can

do that as often as you like and it's

you don't have to declare that you're

doing the fire damage until you hit Oh

sick so I can ignite it a billion times

yep

I gave it a holy fire yeah

the whole yard of Spinelli alright my

first attack that were yours who you

attacking are you attacking one of the

bodyguards the same bodyguard that death

attacked or a different one like um I

can i hmm yeah a different different

bodyguard okay you're attacking Zetas

and is the attack bonus the same as with

my battle axe uh yes cool so then I roll

a oh sorry you can you blacked out

I really fifteen on my okay uh would you

say her attack has a dead is true Chris

Perkins because it's so sneaky

it's a sneaky yes you have advantage

also just like really scary is more

scary than sneaky because this like

giant ball of light is falling out of

the sky with a flaming sword yeah go

ahead Matt increases it by one okay

sixteen all right uh that is deflected

well who do I get to attempt to that

usually yeah another swipe that one was

just to look scary and I were doing an

advantage on the second attack uh no

both are scary

fifteen okay that two he dodges out of

the way out I'm is my battle axe yeah

all right and now it's the regular

initiative count DF they are no longer

surprised by you what would you like to

do

stab again okay go for it just this is

just a regular sword attack yeah

so same target I don't think fourteens

gonna do it no he blocks that with a

small shield alright

and then with that I'm going to use my

cutting action to disengage okay and

then make my way towards where my rest

of the party is waiting for the ambush

very good

alright so DF go skirting off through

the snow leaving evylyn staring down

three growl

next up chosen alright am i in line of

sight of beerus yes i I'm going to take

my trusty little hand crossbow and try

to shoot her with it okay with a poison

dart sounds good alright and I rolled

[Music]

off or did a forehead okay your bolt

goes slightly astray it's only only

slightly so it was close not even oh yes

it flew off into the snow and she

recognizes it immediately and locks eyes

with you for a moment and then Strix

alright um I'm concerned about breaking

the flask with a fireball it's a nice

flask

okay so won't break okay maverick

fireballs for everyone so you drop the

fireball wait I assume sort of not

enveloping or safely Avella people in

yeah I'll do my careful spelling okay

one gets not even you were engulfed in a

fireball but all the fire light just

plays around you she nut she's made two

entire dance

alright roll your damage alright oh come

on hopefully nice to know they all

failed Oh

Gillen hurry oh so happy about this

uh 28 28 points of damage for everybody

yay all right

pretty good that blood ease sauce and he

is just sort of a bird wreck at this

point most of his hair is like a

he is yeah oh I'll also duck back behind

the wall like Boop wouldn't get to me

yeah all right you're ah--this fuming

literally and figuratively after that

blast so as the fire a baton is gone

they're just three smoldering but still

standing drow all the snow around them

is just reduced to Huddle's of water um

all right and as the smoke lifts palton

what would you like to do um I would

like to is this the team distraction

force moment or are we remember what

phase of the plan is the distraction

warm-up this obviously defeat them and

obtain the flash but don't kill Veera in

the middle and which one is looking

which one's looking messed up uh one of

the bodyguards the one that I stabbed

yep yes prey that one we want to kill

yeah oh cool all right

um let's go ahead let me see here uh am

I able to cast this Anna whispers on a

higher level

oh yeah okay yeah I'm please Phil okay

double checking I think you have before

yeah yeah I'm pretty sure I just always

forget which one can I think that's the

one taramis on offense spirits dissonant

whispers yes you can elevate that you do

an extra d6 for each level above first

cool then let's let's uh let's do that

at a trance they're looking pretty

messed up uh he well it's hard to say

definitely that that one guy is is

bloodied so he's lost more than half as

hit points all right let's do a level

three okay so you're gonna do five d6

psychic damage he's got to make it with

some saving through it which he failed

bring on in Jos it's gonna take it all

that was five

uh I'm honestly 5d6 yeah okay cool so um

yeah ah sucking right now uh sixteen

okay

after hearing these horrible horrible

voices in his head he is still alive but

there's like blood coming out of the

orifices alcohol Oh neat yeah should

have taken the fall Joss he does not

look good it looks like any serious blow

might take him down at this point kaha

wreck goes next and he is going to cast

the spell as well uh he's going to cast

he's not going to around he's gonna

cast um uh do phantasmal killer

oh Jesus yeah good thing is using that

spell slot now yeah

just go ahead um first he says he looks

at DF running toward him he says oh

which one you want me to take out the

middle one all right then

he will take out the one who's not quite

so um charred charred yes

taps into the nightmares of the creature

creating an illusory manifestation of

the Duras worst fears sews a death roll

the natural one on his saving throw he

is now

frightened beyond belief and at the end

of each of his turns he's going to take

psychic damage until he dies no

chocolate please forgive all Zanna

give them all a bad time yeah so

suddenly as that up is stricken and

frightened by phantasmal killer what be

as a point of interest you actually

can't see what it is that scares the

 out of him only he's serious cuz

you know everything because you're the

dress um so what woods out of fear let

me think

he's a drow well oh my god

I don't have anything to top that all

right and we're running out of time uh

the drow go next Gareth will pull forth

the flask and she will attempt to trap

kharak oh we should have thought I did

oh he is clearly the biggest threat here

um to her in her view anyway now he has

to make a wisdom saving throat all right

uh my I'm trying to decide if I want to

stop here or tell you what I mean all

right she holds up the flask and tries

to trap Kharak uh in the flask

Couric succeeds on his saving throw she

does not capture him at which point she

puts the stopper back in and says II

surrender Oh

hmm and that's what

Oh Oh No let's waitress yeah a high-ish

note maybe drown don't surrender they're

gonna kill us this it's fine I get the

hand signal for it's fine okay and the
