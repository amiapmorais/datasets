previously on acquisitions incorporated

and dice camera action hello Joel axel

met with omen drawn to negotiate the

robbery of the castle enter Bank however

the bank heist did not go off as planned

and there were some unforeseen

consequences possibly some people were

shunted into a different world I don't

know but Strix got out with the aid of

her word of recall returned to the warm

loving home known as the Waffle House

which hasn't fared well in the weeks

since the top two floors having

basically been trashed leaving the

bottom two floors in a bit of a shambles

and business is suffering however after

killing the wizard Mansion the waffle

crew obtained a black robe of the arch

Magi which they then proceeded to

arrange to sell two acquisitions

incorporated for 50,000 gold pieces a

deal that was concluded last week when

waffle and walnut dumped grass documents

er extraordinaire came by the Waffle

House with paperwork to sign that

paperwork basically divesting the waffle

crew of the robe and giving them a bank

account filled with 50,000 gold pieces

at a at a local bank basically the money

waiting to be picked up by them at their

leisure heck yeah I will probably get it

for real and do whatever we want with it

in other news Jarl axel tried to

persuade the waffle crew to help him get

his hands on the stone of gold ore but

those efforts met with limited success

and the waffle crew having allowed

waffles to fall into Joel Axl's custody

were able to get her back last week when

they said try to convince and have

allowed to fall into I'm feeling like

these are not an accurate representation

more like xtour

and kidnapped Thank You waffle waffles

literally walked on to Jarl Axel's ships

when you weren't around so there was

that

but the waffle crew discovered that

waffles was trapped in one of Jarl Axl's

rings were able to obtain the ring with

some help and bore it safely back to

their residence

where evylyn took her axe and brought it

down on the ring shattering it and an

explosion of light

waffles appears before you and then her

weight sensor collapsing through the

shabby wooden table onto the floor now

we got to buy a new table something else

broke it's fine we're rich important I

though waffles seems to be like fine she

is perfectly fine instantly aware that

she is no longer trapped in this extra

dimensional prison she shakes her head

vigorously some stray feathers fly and

she proceeds to rampage around the

taproom do we all be deadly like group

like cuddle around him like we find a

lost dog and everyone I'll try to hold

hug her and pet her all at the same time

yeah okay I feel like she's doing that

dog thing when they like jump around

like super excited like stomp on the

ground Oh waffles no he told you not to

jump up she's adorable

everyone is reunited now you're still

worn from your ordeal some of you may

still have damaged or spent spell slots

and whatnot so bear that in mind

cool all the children are still

accounted for was make sure everyone is

still here yes we locked the ceilings I

don't think they got out can I don't

think you can lock a ceiling nah not to

ruin the you know safety and thing that

we want that being the kids are home

safe but uh didn't squiggly and Jenks go

off

figure out how to lock this guy they

totally came home again and we're fine

okay so no side adventure yes quickly

just comes in the front door solved well

whatever that means it sounds like we'll

deal with that in the future no promises

good job so this deal that we just made

with walnut next to exchanging this from

what I understand a super powerful cloak

yeah so walnut took the cloak but you

you have up but you have a letter that

basically you will take to the bank and

there's at the top of the letter you can

see is in up near the letterhead is the

bank's address and water deep being

locals you know of this Bank seen it

many times a near travels through the

city it is run as all banks are in the

city by one of the more notable families

noble families the erling stars it's a

very old bank all right

trusted that's a lot of money sitting

somewhere I know we need to repair our

house so that that point I'm a piece of

the ceiling just breaks away and falls

behind you so that would be my priority

but DF I I feel like we have a lot of

things going on right now

can you can you help us prioritize what

we think might be the most important

things for us to take care of at this

very moment okay well we just made it a

massive sale and we should retrieve the

money from that so that we can repair

our house since it isn't quite in just

disarray and further and further making

it dangerous for these kids that you can

live in businesses also stalled people

don't generally come to buy pies out of

a dilapidated half-burnt structure yeah

everything is just in rough shape here

in general that's weird the pies are

still good yes they're lovely stress

uh-huh aside from that we shanks we have

sown and blows the dust off it still

eating it we also know that Durrell axle

very desperately wants the stone of

galore to find this just hidden treasure

that we make sure that doesn't happen so

to do that we need to retrieve the stone

of galore which is currently as far as

we know residing with the Asmodeus

worshipping Kath Landers who didn't they

hire us to get it for them anyway sort

of not really hire us because that would

imply that they gave us something in

exchange there's more of a more of a

trust and they believe that we'll do I'm

such thing a lot of like rich person

entitlement from them we'll just do what

they ask cuz that's what they're used to

and that's not what we're gonna do

yeah they're not allowed to hurt me yeah

I don't want the castle enters to have

the stone of galore or there's possible

dragon horde either because while they

claim it could be used for restoring

whatever was they said it sounded

benevolent at the time frankly I don't

trust it they all I know they wanted the

money to save the souls of their two

youngest children that's yeah that's

what it was yeah and one of their kids

was like a chain demon which ultimately

while it does sound like they certainly

need those kids need to be helped and

saved it's also you know it's their own

doing and a very selfish reason for

wanting this money we also have a very

bad track record with children I think

our children are doing fine yeah they're

killing it man they just locked the sky

there's a big knife from the kitchen but

he got there

Jerell Axl also claims that he would use

his money to put her back within

city of Waterdeep frankly I don't trust

that either if anything I've assumed

that he would use this money to somehow

gain himself more power through

political favors that's my guess

and admittedly I have my own reasons for

wanting the money to what I believe

would help a lot of people and repent

for my own sins and the same time it

seems that Laurel silver hand it's hard

to say but I guess she's putting her

full or full trust and faith in me

Laurel silver hand is yeah what makes

you say that because I don't believe she

wants me to go to get it for herself

like I see no singular singular self

motivation for hurt for wanting this I

think she legitimately wants to do the

right thing that was the person who

revealed themselves to me last week

right that is correct the one that was

there yes doesn't know that yet right

yep correct I didn't know if you told

get better last week or not well when

you sit when you mention her Yvonne's

like oh I might have met him I think

she's the one to give you the ring

you bet her well if you like this whole

time I mean it

it appeared that I was dealing with you

know that priest of Lysander and that

she was being a real big meanie and

making me shut up and stuff but then it

turned out that was miss silver hand or

at least that's what she told me and

then she gave me the ring and she said

she was in disguise which I believed her

but it's very confusing for me is that

the one I sent to wherever they go

mm-hmm oh so is that bad uh I mean I

think you made the right call your

instincts but I don't feel that little

sort of hand is any kind of threat from

us whatsoever but she was there helping

can she do that can't

you just make herself look exactly like

someone else and she she's a wizard from

what little I've experienced

she certainly has extremely powerful

magic so I wouldn't I wouldn't put it

past her no I don't think she was there

just to help save waffles there's no way

you should have known that or found that

so important that she would make it a

point for herself to go and help us she

was there for another reason

possibly keeping an eye on to relax all

especially a few if she was disguised as

someone from the morning spires the

whole I yeah I hmm I don't know I don't

understand this whole Jarl axel is

seeking the light but he's actually not

and I I think I need some time to to

think or or maybe even go to the spires

or something well can we sleep first

yeah yeah we'll just take a moment

before we go anywhere but I think it's

important that

evylyn general axel does not care about

the light he doesn't care about Lysander

and I know that hurts but he was lying

and he was just trying to use you I

think he is a big problem he is and

that's all the reason why we need to

stop him and foot I don't think stopping

him this means going in there blades out

and killing him like there are why not

yeah why not I mean if the open Lord of

Waterdeep is spying on him he's got

bigger problems than us right the better

way to defeat him is to hit him where it

hurts make him lose oh well you know

losing is worse than dying for him he

once told you that he never loses mm-hmm

well see the thing is if he's dead he

can't win either you can still come back

though because when you die you go

someplace else and you can easily crawl

his way back here but if we if we send

him into the light to find his new path

and a new dawn then maybe he'll be a

better person I don't know

kind of person he's gonna find that

lysander and then he can talk he can

take it up with him that's what I was

thinking maybe if anyone can get through

to him it's let they enter yeah I think

you guys might be severely under

estimating him besides if he has further

political allies and we attack him

directly he can tap into those resources

and send those after us I mean I looked

I mean I saw his challenge rating it

wasn't like horrible we might be able to

like go in if he's alone as usual I

don't know what Politan is talking about

but oh yeah I did I couldn't solo him

but if we went in with a plan like we

could do I think we could do it when was

the last time we had a plan that

actually became a plan well we've had

plenty of we've had several plans we

once plan to have a plan

mm-hmm but they don't work people plan

to have a plan right Wow either way

death is right I did underestimate him

in a lot of ways and I just had him all

wrong in a lot of other ways so and if

Laurel Silver Hand was there disguised

as what's-her-face from the spires too

lasted yep mm-hmm she was there as to

last and speaking what seemed like on

friendly terms Tudor lacks all that

could potentially be one of general

axles connections and therefore puts

suspicion on both to lastin and possibly

the entirety of the morning spires we

should probably talk to to the open lord

if you can can you are you guys on like

you know like calling terms could you

just like show up that's not that simple

could we send her a message somehow

can't you'd like your Thursday through

your leg guard badge or something no I

can't open line or something no I don't

have anything like that like home

address No so can you yell into a cop

and I'm a person me yeah yeah the cup

would like a stern you don't have a cup

of this up here I don't have that yeah

okay that's why they call it Pheebs

can't

for all I'd for all I know no one is

supposed to know that her and I are even

have been talking to each other or even

cooperating in the slightest so if

that's the case I'd rather not but her

any extra risk well then it sounds like

maybe our priority should be to fix our

house keep our kids safe and wait till

she deems to contact us I think so I

think six in the house and making sure

that these kids are okay is a good step

to begin with and then that way we have

a better place to rest that we are

better recipe to deal with Castle

matters des lacks all and devil

worshipers and so many other things I'm

just so tired guys yeah there's there's

a lot of baddies this this season it's

really weird well well it sounds like we

all need a nap yeah yeah maybe I can use

a little extra time to figure something

out or plan something but or you could

sleep um you could sleep I could we all

right it's settled then we all go to

sleep okay you wake up having how long

is your plan to sleep like a full like a

long rest sleep or just like a cat nap

okay all right then do you feel much

better after your long rest

it's problematics back its that would

that would put it kind of in the early

evening how long how long our open Intel

so many of the banks double as kind of

gentlemen's and ladies clubs for the for

the well-to-do so they can stay open for

a while okay all right well if we want

to get this place repaired we should

probably retrieve our money and start I

mean at this point we're like regulars

for so many like home repair men and we

probably know like roughly about how

much it's gonna cost you like we don't

have to take all of it out right yeah

maybe we can get a discount or something

well able and paltin I mean the two

you the one who arranged this whole

thing so take it away money is like yeah

so we have to dress up fancy to go to

this bank well I don't know I've never

been in a bank so it is it is customary

not to enter a bank with a bunch of

weapons and armor but to to dress well

yeah when you're a paladin dressing well

just means the same thing and also

always weapons right I'm just saying

banks tend to have securities security

systems so I'm gonna just pull up my

like dress pants but keep the bathrobe

and straw slippers on hots taken care of

well I didn't have a great time last

time I went to a bank so true I maybe

should just like polymorph myself and

just like hide on one of you I mean I'm

not gonna change I'm not really in the

mood so you can hide in one of my

pouches if you want all right

oh well well do you want anyone inside

with you or do you think you can skip it

on your own

oh I'm kind of I'll go with him okay

change all right they may not let you

get in too far being heavily equipped

I'm just going on whoever makes it in I

will stay on them in case things go

south for no reason because I don't warm

are you going to assume while you are

traveling in evil ins pouch just a rat

okay with a little winter you get to the

door and they won't let me in I can be

like here Carlton take this innocuous

pet rat with you we'll just tell him

it's a it's a therapy rat and emotional

support rat I am an emotional support

reg not even alive I don't think it's a

bad idea to have at least evylyn ready

just in case who knows but

I'll try to go with you hold on one

second I'm gonna throw something nice on

India thil run off to his room okay

basically throw on like just like that

like fluffy dress shirt that he wore to

the party the manner even though it's

definitely like still like a little

dirty he hasn't used it since then he's

throws that on comes back alright I'm

ready

I've just well when you come back

downstairs make a quick perception check

for media okay twenty twelve thirty one

so yeah your room is your room was

rendered basically a disaster area by

the ceiling collapse over it but you can

still get to the dresser that has your

garment and whatnot and throw that on

there are birds now living in various

corners of your room and whatnot but you

also see what appears to be a dead

partially eaten rat kind of lying on the

floor by the dresser and it's sort of

bloated in a weird and strange way and

when you kind of take a gander at it you

think it was poisoned to death and then

fed on we're all making the same face

yeah and it strikes you that a this kind

of look the rate looks like the rat

suffered a similar poisoning as paltin

did when he was attacked by imps and now

we're infested infested I'm going to

take the body of this rat go back

downstairs and show it to Strix okay

yeah a strike is just a muse like oh you

look really nice yeah yeah it's clear

the rat was stung by some sort of

poisonous stinger died and then

was partially eaten probably by a

creature doesn't get affected by poison

so I don't know why the imps must still

be here listening to us is the problem

of course yeah they're invisible right

you're almost you're you're now that now

that you've said it aloud you're pretty

darn sure the castle actors are smart

enough to keep tabs on anybody who might

come looking for them good thing we just

reviewed our whole play now well it's a

good thing that you know trying to get

the stone from them was totally a

hypothetical and we determined is not

the best course of action isn't that

right uh I do have protection against a

good and evil so I that might do

something we definitely won't be looking

further stone I mean we did say we were

just gonna fix our house we are going to

fix our house and do nothing else we

have no further interest in the stone

paulson even I don't believe you get a

deception up in here go ahead make it a

separate check oh okay that is a 30 mm

hm hmm

I mean there's no one technically around

so who knows just saying that's a good

role though for all intents and purposes

yeah let us leave as we do every tonight

like do you think there's somewhere I

can set up one of those like like sticky

like fly tapes for amps low huh like

just hang it from the ceiling and like

biggests like stick to it like oh can I

do like in our cottage check to think of

there some way that I could like that I

could get them out of the house go ahead

just to see if I know anything 17 yeah

you think that there are there are

methods rituals that can be performed on

structure

do basically impart upon a structure

aspect similar to that of protection

from evil and good spell that spell is

low level and only targets creatures but

there are more powerful versions of that

kind of magic that can ward buildings

and keep out things how much do you

think that costs

ballpark figure you think you could

probably get the whole house protected

that way for about 2500 gold

you guys haven't let even know this yet

have you

I think this is just an internal

conversation yes having yeah Strix is

like thinking the math is appearing

doesn't even know that there are imps in

the house yet yes we do we did aloud we

yes because I can I mean I could if you

guys just want to know where they are I

mean I could divine sense them sure good

oh yeah you use your news your your

light senses you don't you want to get

like some bugs at pans ready or

something yeah oh yeah sense them

they're still here we need to get rid of

them to stop them from me they're spying

on us or possibly threatening the kids

yeah the problem is is they're just

gonna come back act because there's no

ceiling well I mean well let's find

these ones right so when you activate

your superpower and you can immediately

sense that there is one within three

feet of you evilly can I like as soon as

I sense it just you sure can make an

attack role it's at disadvantage because

it's still invisible even though you can

sense it

would it for for I guess that's a

grapple actually yeah you are

so role your strength athletics at

disadvantage a disadvantage oh poopies

let's see this thing is pretty agile but

alright

it's you hear it flutter away as you

reach out to

but I can still sense it right yeah

that's getting farther away from you

right now so I'm just like chasing it

and pointing where it's going straight

going up it's going up the spiral

staircase I'm trying to grab it I'm like

following it okay let me see how fast

not exert this is there and as you as

you are go making grabby hands at it and

it's fluttering away from you you're you

still got your effect up and you can

sense that there are other imps in the

building elsewhere this thing can what's

your speed with the wings 30 okay it

goes faster than you so it is getting

away from you

no I'm pointing at it and as you as you

flutter upstairs trying to reach out it

flies out through the broken window in

the hallway and outside and others are

still in the house around all right

even evil emotions districts and she's

like then she starts fluttering like

sneaky fluttering like it's toward the

other magic on their invisibility do you

wait to try that I mean if you want I

can tell where they are yeah

yeah if you get within range of a dispel

magic you can oh if I know their

location couldn't I cast like a moon

beam on it

how do you have to kind of see what

you're targeting so that won't work but

it's not an area so but moon beam yeah

you can attempt to what's the range of

that spell 120 feet yeah you could

essentially try to call down a moon beam

on top of one of them or I mean in I

could use my axe bazooka too but yeah

I'll call down a moonbeam first okay

let's see there is a constitution saving

throw and before I do I I tell Strix

where I'm doing it so she can be ready

for the the flank roll your radiant

damage

Judy 10 oh I hit yeah I failed it safe

judy 1003 n-- okay you completely bug

zap it and you don't sense it anymore at

this point at this point evylyn there's

this big beam shining down through the

wrecked remains of your home you can

sense the other ones are getting farther

away fast

like there's scatter house eventually

you do seem to clear out the house they

go beyond the range of your detection

ability she Wiggles the moon beam around

like y'all don't come back I just love

it just like hitting I'm like the bug

zapper yeah if you think they're gone at

least like mostly gone in that in the

establishment well all right that should

buy us a little bit of time so we can

take care of some other crap yeah

they're not after us right now yeah or

defy our strongholds yeah they don't

know what we're doing alright the whole

infestation we build a new house from

the ground up at this point it might be

easier isn't it crazy this place is

still a rental all right as you head out

there are people moving around in the

city in in this hour of the evening most

of them heading to and from places of

business where they can buy meals and

have good dinners you get some friendly

nods as you pass by heading toward the

bank when you get to the bank you see

it's a very old mansion like structure

on a corner with a corner tower that has

stone moss covered steps leading up to a

double set of oak doors with fancy

knockers on them and what appears to be

carved into the architrave a symbol that

looks like a ship a mastered ship and as

you step inside there is

cello playing this old woman in a corner

playing a somber tune the room are the

entire interior of the house kind of has

an old mansion II feel and you can smell

that the the rugs and carpets here are

kind of very old and musty there may

even be mold growing somewhere it's a

it's not the most pleasing odor but

there's also its intermingled with the

smell of incense and scented candles and

there are oil lamps burning and these

lamps are mounted to the walls there is

all kinds of curved wood everywhere wood

paneling wooden banisters that have

gilded railings and tables and padded

chairs with a lot of generally speaking

older people sitting in them lounging

smoking talking in low tones almost like

the rental library and pictures

paintings everywhere and one of the

interesting things you notice about many

of these paintings that they seem to be

alive as in moving the the scenes

depicted in them are not frozen at the

as you make your way up a staircase onto

a balcony you see there's a huge gilded

framed picture of a ship on a

storm-tossed sea and the whole ship is

moving and the sea is moving you can see

Lightning flashing behind it the whole

business and it is at the end of this

balcony that you can see a counter that

serves as where the bank tellers are and

there are no tellers but you can see

what looks like a manager a decrepit old

man with big thick spectacles who's

basically rifling through some papers

and just sort of sorting things out at a

bank teller station um

I mentioned before we left that since

we've done this so many times we

probably had like a vague estimate of

how much money we were going to need

do you probably have a conversation on

the way yeah yeah do we do what what

would that knowledge be well how much

money do we think we need it depends on

what you're planning to build or are you

just basically trying to get the house

back to its previous state yeah I think

even was trying to convince everyone

that they needed a sunroom but yeah

definitely saying that there should be a

mage tower at the top that that looks

kind of like the black staff top Howard

well the black Stef tower is basically

just this blocky thick stone monstrous

and cooler that whereas you've got more

of a Victorian turret on your current

structure to repair the building you

would estimate the B it would be about

the same cost as it would to inspect the

way that restricts was thinking so about

another twenty five hundred that's

replacing furnishings that's replacing

the walls the roof the turret everything

that's not that bad sorry why did you

say it was about twenty-five hundred for

all of the repair work

plus the 2500 that Strix was thinking

about for the magical ward and also

maybe a taller pointy or tower that

Strix can can live in so look if I don't

get a sunroom I don't understand why we

need a mage tower one of the other

details I did not I neglected to mention

earlier on about this Bank is as you

entered the structure you see that your

weapons become ghost-like

that is to say they're still attached to

you but they're sort of shimmery and

transparent and when you reach for them

your hands just sort of pass right

through them oh good okay my staff -

that is a good question

[Music]

yes your staff you can well actually

that that would be yeah your staff would

essentially fall out of your hand at

that point oh wait no I'm not I am a rat

doesn't matter all right never what yeah

yeah anyway but good to know but I'm a

rat yes you're a rat oh if we wanted to

just win everyone's like in armor ouch

so if we wanted to just repair it and

try ensorcelled it with upper typical

protection spell on the structure that

would cost about five thousand gold

pieces and we're supposedly getting

fifty thousand yeah I think that we

should leave the rest in the bank cuz

who knows what else might come our way

yeah well do you want any like extra

secret passages d/f from the house maybe

you like you can we can add some money

for that oh no I got plenty right um

well I mean evylyn and palton who really

were the ones who arranged this deal to

help earn the money so we definitely

need to upgrade the bar I yeah it's

pretty trashed I think it's only fair

that you guys kind of get say and how

it's used it was actually I think Strix

is earth elemental that destroyed your

bar let's not worry about that alright

so who's going up to the old geezer at

the the counter I think Politan should

do it I have all my weapons and he's all

dressed up yes dress pant pad up with

your slippers yep

all goes back up because I put on a

fancy shirt right all right you you two

young gentlemen step up you can see that

he is so unwrapped with sorting through

papers that he seems oblivious to you at

first and what do you do to get his

attention what do we do clear my throat

loudly he doesn't seem to hear it hey is

there like a ring bell for service yeah

no just do he doesn't seem to hear that

either okay I like like throw a piece of

paper Adam yeah you're gonna take a slip

of paper and cos he notices that he

looks up at you hey are you here to open

an account we are here wait what are we

doing but you have the powder we're

trying to retrieve this we have the

voucher you have a letter we have a

letter letter to work as a voucher Oh

excellent

may I see it thank you he looks at it oh

yes a young lady came by to set this up

hmm very efficient hmm there's no money

in it I'm sorry

now when you say no money do you mean

fifty thousand gold the account is empty

no one's deposited anything in it yet

that is directly contrary to what walnut

told you uh-huh why did I think we would

actually get this money yeah why hold on

why I'm sorry there seems to be some

confusion the account is emptying saying

nothing has been put into it yet as it's

never had money in it the account was

opened but there hasn't been any

deposits into it yet some stuffs hard

and she's like does the letter say sort

of real he just sort of reading your

lips with his big magnifying glasses it

does and she's talking just as much to

death and fault initia sir the guy does

the letter say we have the white right

to withdraw this much money from the

account does it never actually represent

that there was that much money in the

account

it the document says that II basically

it's giving you an account with 50,000

gold pieces in it well there must be

some mistake because I can't imagine

that walnut or especially omen would I'm

sorry go ahead

well I mean I don't really have a good

judge of character anyway so I guess

you're right anyone just steps back and

watches is there anything else I can

help you with yeah could you possibly

and for most of when this account was

opened yeah he will tell you that it was

opened let's see this morning by a

lovely very polite elven woman I miss

dump grass I believe she called herself

and and after setting up the account

said that there would be money deposited

in the account or thought we could send

we could send the letter through strix

his hat - oh man - what's going on there

tiny little rat hat you here this week

do you read I can I can do it now walnut

I told you when she gave you the piece

of paper that the money was there uh-huh

and she would not have taken the cloak

without wait okay so we take this to

memory and we say hey somebody messed up

do we have a carbon copy I did I I'm

leaving and I'm turned back into myself

you knew it you would have one copy of

the contract don't if if if I'm myself

now sorry nice and stank up the club but

if the amps were listening the castle

enters could have come here and taken

our money out no the money was never put

in there's never any money to actually

take yeah the account was open and there

were no deposits so they just didn't put

the money in which means this account

was open and created specifically for

this transaction and well not wasn't

while that's not a liar

especially when it comes to official

paperwork like that she believed the

money was in there so I don't think she

was lying to us or doing anything to

swindle us into getting this cloak do I

trust the old man gonna make an insight

check I would love to well now that I'm

me again I'm gonna go look for snacks 19

there were some downstairs on the table

you smell them you don't sense any

duplicity from him you think he's a he's

a functionary who is doing what he has

probably been doing for the last 60

years

give him up he just looks at you with

his thick glasses can I just can I just

send a little note through your hat yeah

also I guess I'm just holding my staff

with a mage hand I don't know if it's

going through my hands net yeah I

probably would be it would be lying on

the floor kind of ghostly floating next

to me yeah now in each hand it yeah

because your mage hand is made of force

you can actually use that to hold it you

think you could also probably turn it

into something that is not overtly a

weapon and it would be fine

no okay well if I turn in my broom then

then it's just mine she comes assault

weapon

it's just the brooms are some of the

deadliest weapons known to man

I think that's an opinion should I keep

the account open yes please keep the

account open there were you a little

confused about a couple of things

they'll have you hear a letter back just

say yeah uh-huh

thank you if you could just give us a

moment please does anyone have does

anyone have a copy of the the sale

contract that we made with walnut on us

Asterix balsam yes okay sorry Holly

you're freezing up on me

I know I'm sorry all right all right

yeah so we got that I am going to quick

take this contract and go through it

specifically in the articles discussing

the actual accountant the money the

payment how askew it is quite a detailed

contract you can probably find like a

table downstairs which you can just sort

of or a couch or something that you can

sit on and flip through it yeah yeah

yeah okay and some people will come by

or Maitre D' will come by and give you

offer you a drink or bring some snacks

yeah das is gonna read through this and

definitely pretend like he knows exactly

what he's looking for what's going on

there but there's definitely to be a lot

of words in there that he does not

understand this this was clearly written

by somebody well accustomed to a legal

lingo yeah yeah it seems very involved

airtight agree if one even tries to

borrow like a pen and paper which I

assume she can find at the bank right

and she'll just write a quick note

that's like dear omen sorry to bug you

about business when usually I write as a

friend hope you don't mind just kind of

a big deal cuz it's about our house we

have this contract that walnut left with

us and I don't know how to get in touch

with her but it's our

our money's not here I'm sure it's an

oversight but if you or walnut could

respond ASAP that'd be great

so that we can have a roof over our head

Thanks evylyn I send it to that can you

hear me okay yes yeah okay yeah yeah all

right oh so I'll take my hat off

yeah and just pull it out stuff it in

there yeah okay put the hat back on

message was sent tails first he kills

Rosie be used to her then steals her

money

unbeliev well we'll see if we will get a

response anytime soon

knowing him likely not now I to be fair

she be fair some walnut I understand

that they're going through quite a bit

right now by my understanding their

headquarters has gone through some

pretty intense demo to rent out

procedures what's interesting though is

that that has nothing to do with us look

I know but look I'm just saying if I'm

hired to do a job I don't think the

client cares about my personal life I

know you're right but walnut sir well

that's our friend right I I put I would

put the friend in light quotes I mean I

would say yes but again apparently my

perception of these things askew you're

you're harping on that a lot about no

it's fine sorry

she says the snare I don't think you

need an insight on that one

no I like I asked evylyn after about an

hour of sitting okay this contract DFU

you don't feel smarter and you're all

you're pretty sure of is there there is

the part and actually it well not was

very good about kind of highlighting it

or marking it that actually covers the

exchange it's like you know she will

take the cloak back to acquisition

corporated when she takes custody of the

cloak the gold will already be in the

account ready to be withdrawn you have

the only letter of withdrawal and that's

it okay so okay so we definitely are the

only eight people able to withdraw from

the account other people would be able

to access it and deposit but we should

be the only people allowed to withdraw

maybe who knows maybe she's got caught

up in something and had to go take care

of it maybe we should like check back

tomorrow or something like who delays

happen all the time right

was it like her responsibility to make

the deposit that is not in the contract

it was acquisitions incorporate its

responsibilities according to the

contract to make the deposit deposit

only to get the signatures for maybe

someone maybe maybe someone was like

waylaid bringing the money or deposit

right there's a lot of possibilities

here I look as much as much I hate to

say it like when acquisition corporated

makes a contract I mean so long as

everything is done properly like they

adhere to it so it's possible that maybe

something happened to walnut or maybe

someone else was coming by to make the

deposit and

strix looks that the all band is like

did you say she was friendly uh the old

man says what I get closer and I'm like

did you say she was friendly he sort of

withdraws when you get right in his face

and he says yes she was friendly as in

like she was smiling yes she had a

lovely smile oh it doesn't sound like

walnut oh oh no that does not sound like

walnut walnuts dead what look maybe she

just really likes these kind of

proceedings she does she did seem

to take great pride in her work that

sounds like walnut to me walnut walnut

walnut might be dead I don't think so

well how about well we just go ask him

directly

maybe if they're there that's our the

actually positions Inc headquarters is

not terribly far from where you are it's

only yeah well we just what would you

start with that and see if they have any

answers for any possible hang-ups I feel

like we're jumping to a lot of

conclusions it's probably really really

easy to clear up let's just go to AG -

this is so awkward because I already

sent that message and now we're gonna go

in person it's gonna look so clean I

think I can I think I can unsend it like

oh my gosh please deep in the hack a

sort of rifle errata you sort of grab on

to a corner of it you pull it back out

yeah here you go

we'll go there even find out who killed

walnut sure guys we're there before so

you probably had the best idea of what

to do so you guys you go it you go ahead

I'll talk to that nice clerk yeah we

lead the way okay you make your way and

the acquisitions incorporated

headquarters seems to have suffered some

serious damage particularly the south

side of the building a lot of the facade

appears to be missing however there is

scaffolding all up on basically half of

the structure and there are some people

working into the early hours of the

evening to try to make repairs and you

can see some of those people are

levitating Wizards see they can afford a

nicer guy than Rick in and you can also

make out what appears to be

a gnome a female gnome looking at some

papers talking to or in the presence of

a a well-dressed but clearly dead or

should I say undead man who's just sort

of staring stupidly down at the same

papers and you also see what appears to

be a donkey barking orders in common at

a cloud of darkness that hangs in the

air except for the occasional

and it seems this darkness cloud almost

seems to be stirred and misshapen by

some wind that whistles around it and

there's occasional little spark of light

almost like lightning that leaps from

the darkness and a hissing voice to

accompany it but all these figures are

just sort of involved in the

reconstruction sitting outside the

building with a box next to him hands

over his head knees up to his chest is a

crying figure you don't know this person

but they're out on the street with a box

of what looks like desk supplies crying

in the street the doors of course at

this hour are closed but there are a

couple lights deep within the structure

and indicate that there's probably

cleaning staff or something working

inside one will go up to the crying

person and Pat them on the back and say

they're there

are you all right victim overtightened

built a tighten belt was it magical what

did it squeeze you too hard no I lost my

job why tighten bolts well that doesn't

sound like something someone should lose

a job over and even picks him up from

talk to omen right now oh no no no I do

I don't want to disturb omen no no I

don't want to stir it mister drawn no no

it's fine anyone feel this sad no no

please know everything they know well

okay

is he real terror in his eyes I pushed

she's shocked she's like why don't you

want to talk to open because he doesn't

need my services anymore well what kind

of services are those I was a clerk I

handled paperwork and filing they let I

think they let ten of us go well intent

lurks this is like the third purge this

year Oh

do you think they're running out of

money I had good reviews I believe you

you seem like a very capable person even

though you're crying out here in the

street I don't know how I'm gonna make

my next rent payment well that's why you

should have to open I can't do that I

mean maybe you know that attitude but I

think you should go talk to your former

boss and get your job back you doing you

know you don't know you don't understand

you don't talk to mr. drom I do we have

he looks at me I say it just like once

okay but uh I've never saved this life

what's that I know of well let's maybe

maybe one of those papers you signed was

the difference between life and death

for omen drugs I don't have authority to

sign papers we're prepared or whatever

you know copied whatever it is you do

everyone's job is important

apparently not mine Wow so after killing

Rosie B stinger and stealing her 50,000

gold now he's laying off people who were

relying on him for income unacceptable

well as you can see either they did take

a lot of damage yeah onyx oak

so what you're saying is the it's not

that you were poor at your job you were

just let go because they had to tighten

their belt that's what I was told and

this is the verb tighten the belt and

not an object or say gang name called a

title there is an actual belt like

around the company do explain he says

it's well one time one of my fellow

clerks misfiled something and well he he

got chastised and then he got berated

and then he got demoted and then he got

a pay cut and then he got flogged I'm

gonna just be like what's what's with

the belt the belt what's what's your

name sir he says his name is called all

right mr. curled I'm gonna reach into my

robe I take out a little business card

it's like well my name is Paul can set

those up and SEPA and I think you might

have a case here I can't afford to pay

anything I'm commission-based we win

then I just take a percentage will you

lose it's gonna be fine you want trust

me wait do you want me to take legal

action against acquisitions incorporated

I think we have a great case here you

see all this damaged thing that to me

screams insurance fraud you sound like a

lawyer for sure it is my job can I like

reception check or just see if there's

anyone I recognize like maybe if there's

someone I've seen before go ahead

fifteen no you don't recognize in fact

you think that some of the most of the

workers that seem to be working into the

night probably on overtime are probably

City guilds folk they're there from

guilt because repairs actually have to

be handled through the mechanisms of the

city

now the individuals who are the weird

ones that I described the talking donkey

they don't seem to be dressed the same

way as the workers and actually you see

that the donkey and the dead guy and the

gnome all have acquisitions inc taverts

with a symbol on it that kind of looks a

little bit like a hexagon with a dot in

the middle of it and then a tail on the

hexagon kind of in the shape of a pea

like the letter P oh um I just realized

that maybe he he huh what was that

strikes oh all right they are they

rebranding it looks like they're wearing

some sort of weird modified version of

the a kink logo hmm um excuse me crying

sir what was your name coral corral um I

have two questions one is do you know

what that logo means that they're

wearing he looks over to blurry eyes his

red eyes and he says oh that's the

that's the P team Oh what is P stand for

nothing okay my second question is if

you happen to have been a clerk for

acquisitions incorporated did you happen

to see any documentation come across

around the this

of a magical cloak and $50,000 what's a

dollar I'm glad I'm glad you asked that

Ana because he says he was aware paper

work was started on a contract a 50,000

gold piece contract for a robe and

flabbergast a wizard a high-level wizard

within the company was basically taking

point on that deal was getting that

paperwork done but the he says the

paperwork was not finished

oh well that's so weird because there

was there was an incident what kind of

incident that makes a magical

catastrophe inside the building that did

a tremendous amount of damage hmm well I

guess then if needed he says he doesn't

remember all the details because

afterward he and several other employees

were taken to flabbergast to have their

memories magically altered what is that

part of your contract yeah as I found

out whoa Oh God

okay if we wanted to find this flapper

cast we're a good look for him hey you

know wizards they're strange Bunch

he likes to he likes to work odd hours

he's probably still inside helping just

sort out the damage and he was he has

some clerks helping him catalog for

insurance purposes anything that was

lost

listen corraled I believe that you are

good at your job no I know I know you're

good at your job you always got good

reviews you said so yourself in fact I

want you to oh you can prove it right

now not to me I got up to e you don't

have to prove it to anyone else

you're only gonna prove it to yourself

to show just how good you are at your

job I need you to look at this contract

you hand on this thing yeah it's like

okay he takes a look at it he seems to

recognize its presentation and he says

this is this isn't right this this

contractor was never written I mean it

was never finished this contract is

finished who finished this oh and he

looks at the end huh what is a document

sir huh huh what what is huh

what does this mean what is this well

it's he says this seems like a real

contract it looks like other contracts

that we've put through our system and it

it's signed by its authorized by a

level-3 document sir so that's good

walnut right trust it yes yes uh-huh is

there a but coming

is there something wrong not as far as I

can tell

so then with all this information here

could you possibly think of any legal

loophole or written word or for some

reason that that money would not be in

that account as promised ready for

withdrawal plus the was the robe

received yeah what it is right the robe

yeah then the money should be their

contract fully uh-huh and if it's not

what does that mean I think that means

we have a case well that means that the

the exchange is improper it's invalid

that the that the robe must be returned

or the money delivered promptly and if

fines could have to be applied this

could be taken to a magistrate oh well

we definitely don't need to do that I'm

sure it was a mistake I'm sure we'll

just get our money as soon as we can

talk to ohm now like if it's part of

this if it's part of the contract that's

the means that needs to be taken to that

mic you know but worth looking into if

we don't get any could sue us I mean

then then yes

not as could you you know we did this

lovely person a job he's been her Soho

so so far for us do the books of the

past and that would be awesome to do

once we say get fifty thousand gold

pieces that certainly is a possibility

the coral is there anything in there

about the retrieval of the robe does it

say it has to be returned to a certain

person or certain place before the money

is deposited or just once it's the

custody by acquisitions incorporated the

money has to be already in the account

it sounds like we've pretty much

confirmed over and over that the

contract we understood it correctly

Koral thinks it's solid and if if the

rope was turned over then you should

have your money or else acquisitions Inc

would be basically in default of the

contract which is pretty serious I don't

like this and I just want to blow things

up

look we blow more things up then we

probably won't get our money we're gonna

go talk to like Accounts Payable or

whoever that is

or possibly flabbergast it's used one

who supposedly set this whole thing up

there's a lot of things we should talk

to our gas inside right that's what

that's what you said yes inside

let's contract this lovely person to be

our representative and he can help us

navigate all of aking while we do it all

I'm saying is that a crossover episode

or one party is suing another sounds

hilarious

[Laughter]

all right

since since you have taken great care to

be so kind and friendly to him and

evylyn you see that he can't take his

eyes off you he's just sort of swimming

in your your your your your beauty and

your majesty and the the air that you

I've also been like patting his back and

rubbing Asher and like reassurance oh so

he has taken a shine to you this has not

gone unnoticed by certain other members

of

party but he will lead you up and inside

and you can see that the damage to the

interior is even more extreme than the

damage to the exterior of the building

though some offices remain intact but it

isn't long before coral that's able to

take you to flabbergast who is basically

managing a series of checklists with

various clerks when flabbergast looks

down his nose at corraled

he says didn't with I am which I'm sure

was a big mistake he flips through some

papers and says no not mistake at this

point you can see that flabbergast scat

this sort of coiling around his ankles

and this cat wears a viking helmet and a

monocle Strix is gonna sidle up next to

evil and be like can you can you tell if

that cat is a demon or not or a devil or

something it looks super suspicious it

just sort of eyes you with its monocle

like that's I'm just I'm getting weird

vibes and he says so why have you graced

us with your presence what what did you

have oh no patty-pans just taking notes

of everything there he sees the cat he's

like potential animal cruelty um

we're here because we have a contract

that seems to have gone unfulfilled and

we've retained the services of this

amazing clerk who luckily happened to be

free just to help us navigate this

process we have the contract right here

DF do you want to show him the contract

I don't think we need to physically hand

it to him at all but it clearly has

stated as corraled can tell you that

there's supposed to be an account with

50 gothic gold pieces upon gasps tries

to snatch it from you I think he said he

wasn't gonna give it to him so I'll

probably try to like holding it okay so

you just go ahead and make a dexterity

check proposed by his strength traffic

yeah you probably got him on oh he wrote

I'm not twenty Wow

just adding dexterity bonus yes 24 you

still even with his nap 20 are able to

he gets it and then you pull it through

his fingers I rolled a 19 plus 5 so nice

don't try to outrun a rogue well yeah

badly it's like man hold on

I don't trust you holding this you keep

smart speak to our representative he

said it was like that was quite rude

he says him is this kennel to be right

as we negotiated earlier that we I would

gladly have set you up of the contract

but as you can see we have other

problems here well I don't know if

you're aware that contract wouldn't have

it written well you can see here that a

level 3 document sir and she looks at

curled beauty you're sort of flipped to

the page with the walnut signature you

see he pulls out his own monocle puts it

in his eye and stares at it and then he

goes pale and faints did we do it did it

work I think that's a good sign that the

cat just sort of is now on him licking

his nose even will Boop on hands like

poke him he comes to it stares up at you

you seems to have fainted when I showed

you that walnut dog grass a level three

documents or did prepare and sign this

document saying you owe us fifty

thousand dollars on this piece he sort

of looks at it again and and almost

faints again but keeps himself together

and says yeah I'm going to lose my job

why would you lose your job for

something that was perfectly aboveboard

you were the one that did this don't you

remember yes I know but I never got

around to actually getting the contract

out is what I'm trying to tell you I

have to confess something the chaos in

the dry will hear your confession on all

intents and purposes this is on record

we lost a clone I'm sorry you lost a

clone I'm sorry

you its Awad now one of our clones

escaped during the magical calamity

Kwan's of who but you didn't hear it

from me but we have begun cloning some

of our key employees you did what

please tell me that I'm not considered a

key employee who are you saved it's fine

don't worry about it clone escaped so

you're saying that the person who

prepared this document for us was a

clone of a level 3 document sir why

would the clone do that I don't know I

mean I don't know why the clone would do

that all I'm telling you is that I'm

sure it was the real walnut and not the

clone I'm sure you're just worried about

nothing the real one that's probably off

frolicking somewhere I mean the clone

moment I don't think I could ever see

one that frolicking but that's why the

clone would do it I'm flabbergasted say

there was a magical event here and in

the cloning lab one of the clones broke

loose and got away they only realized

that after they went down and realized

they was missing and it wasn't supposed

to get out well we could offer you

protection and job security or financial

secure than to say that in court

I imagine no well shouldn't you be happy

that whoever this is just did your job

for you and finish the contract we asked

them where's the the robe where's Jim's

robe has become of Jim's robe oh now I

see the significance in this that's not

good oh no oh that's another clone has

it Oh

well according to this contract you

still owe us 15,000 that's true it's not

bones

was as a recite one I didn't have that

money on me as I said during our

negotiation I can cover half of it but

the other half was going to be

negotiated with omen uh well yeah I mean

are they going to get skinned alive

Oh like no one no one should be skinning

anyone alive I'm not sure what's going

on here but last time I was banished to

the far realm us something somewhere

straight flabbergast I dismiss nibbly we

must leave at once you're being a bit

dramatic you you see he gets very

dramatic and throws his papers up in the

air pushing his way through the clerk's

to get to his office and starts packing

things in a valise including a spell

book which he stuffs in first I asked

corraled it open here does he have an

office here see you have a clue

coral doesn't know if omens here he does

have an office here the office was

partly damaged chances are though omen

clocks out at 5:00 that's you know

leaves after doing all the flogging I

guess also you do know he does tell you

that in the magical event woman was

actually wounded and taken to the the

tower of luck to convalesce for a while

but he he checked himself out once he

was healed up and returned to assess the

damage

but then after firing a bunch of people

left and said that was a good day's work

and that's well evylyn says to the rest

of europe she's like if I know one thing

about omen is that he always honors

contracts we honored the contract we

gave an employee of acquisitions

incorporated we doesn't matter they're

clone clone or not it's not our fault

that they cloned are definitely a part

of it though you know you just you don't

understand

as soon as that clone forged those

documents that is termination grants

don't afraid for you

no fire did oh if this was the fake

walnut Don grass the moment she forged a

contract she was no longer employee if a

I just walked away

now without jim's robe I'm a dead man

for sure yes you are he grabs his

beliefs he grabs mr. snib Lee under his

arm

and he starts to fly away whoa through

the hole in the roof or is it really is

it forging I mean it doesn't sound like

foraging to me I don't think so wait

don't let him fly away we can take half

or something like at least that's more

money than we have right that was

promised so can we at least get that

before you're skinned alive oh please I

didn't get the rope

no rope no money no the robe was given

to a member of acquisitions incorporated

no it was not thank you say no guys he

said no it's okay it's okay

not an ex-employee it was ex-employee

guys I think he's right on this one I'm

fine let's just go home Lin she just

like sits on the ground

I don't think omen will let this happen

I think we need to talk to omen no I

think I would let this happened but I

think what is a something that I'm

worried about is just wall out no discus

wrist is dinar like they probably all

have clones

well maybe not dinar they didn't say

most valuable vault no they probably

don't know and just for the record I

believe that omen is up to as they would

say shady

okay so then we we get the robe back oh

yeah you can locate it can't you if we

find the road back and just return it to

acquisitions ourselves that would

fulfill the contracts yes but this is I

I think we should just write a letter to

omen real quick just let him know what's

happening

we just know no more letters and I pull

my hat down no more dumping thorn

objects into my hat what let's find the

robe before we start talking more about

this yeah thank Ria's paulten on this

one

and I know it seems like a good idea to

talk to almond but one of the most

valuable things that he has is

information and if we had this

information about the clones the last

thing we want to do is tip that hand to

them that could upset them or seek

retribution or something that way or try

to cover up this this heinous act really

if real loners the cloak ourselves and

get it back then we can get our money

well we know where the drawn and cornea

is right yeah that's all way up in red

larch well Luke try and locate the cloak

first falton maybe maybe walnut is

around here I don't I don't think I have

a way to uh I don't have a way to find

it you have located object it's only got

a range of hundred thousand feet or so I

have locate creature oh oh I have

located object my bad

we all who cares but yeah on the ground

it is possibly quite farther away than

that her oldest now consoling you Strix

Oh someone's paying attention to me

yep well other other than locate object

which I don't think we'll be able to use

to find this since it's probably farther

away than that the only thing I can

think of is to go to red larch and talk

to the real walnut we don't have time

there

to read large no and I don't think well

not has anywhere to go and guessing what

they're doing is they could be here

somewhere in the city they're probably

not far I think we could poke around

here and find more informations what

what people know yeah where does this

Laboratory of clones can we go see Matt

Correll doesn't he didn't know anything

about it you said something about the

basement right I'm clear let's go look

okay evylyn just starts traipsing around

headquarters oh yeah there's gonna let

us okay okay well there the person in

charge just flew out the window right

yeah so at some point oh can we lose

office oh hell no we're not stealing

from acquisitions incorporated gold

pieces worth of staples like what

collateral

your staples give us our gold as weird

as you are as you're prowling around to

basically stomping around without

security passes figures begin to

converge on your location and they

include a cloud of darkness and whirling

wind that has occasional little shots of

lightning coming out of it a donkey and

you can see up close that this donkey

where's hoof wraps cool cool the zombie

who is pulling out a lute and the gnome

who has put away her papers popped up

her goggles and is stroking a clockwork

rat she says as she strokes there at

thou shalt not wander the halls of

acquisitions incorporated you must leave

now we have a contract saying your

company is in debt to us and we have

full right to acquire anything up to or

close to the value of 50,000 gold and

all we are asking is to look around she

says I wish to give that contract to our

document sir for inspection

we will accompany you and show ourselves

and she says Rebecca and a Ken coup so

it comes out of a pile of debris pokes

its head up and shambles toward you and

risk Rebecca the king who is wearing a

suit of trash armor and just sort of

shambles over and reaches for the

contract to inspect it closely and holds

out and just puts on on her beak a bent

pair of spectacles that she'd clearly

got out of the trash somewhere that was

wholly before Yelp well let the Kangoo

all right contract this contract she

sort of says nope and the gnome says

this contract does not allow you to do

what you says it allows you to do it

does not grant you any license to wander

these halls or any security clearance

whatsoever well it does mean that you

owe us $50,000 and y'all are in default

of that so do you have that Alton what

teaching me all these words that I don't

know what they mean they just fall out

in the mouth like listen listen who's

who's the highest up right now in here I

would like to speak to them immediately

says the cloud of Darkness I've seen

weirder sure come can we can we chat

please please just in private I am Sofia

moon elf warlock of the queen of Heron

darkness okay

and if you don't leave at once

we will destroy you okay well first of

all that will be noted and potentially

using the case second of all I'm just

saying we have a contract here that is

signed by a third level document sir now

either either you argue with either you

are not gonna honor a contract or your

green eyes closed until further notice

you are going to acknowledge that this

is a forged signature from a clone that

you probably don't want you live now in

violation you're in violation guys I'm

sorry to think we're getting a little

and over our heads here we're running in

circles you can see that the the zombie

bard starts to play a tune and it's just

like off course brown blonde okay fine

we'll just leave and talk to omen

himself my pen pal and personal friend

the the donkey sort of gets up on its

hind hooves and makes fists he I hate

this but I want the clockwork brat

come on we're leaving leave or suffer

the wrath of the PT did you just hear

that there the PT the PD who are you

P team is this week what's the female

Rock gnome petting the clockwork rat

says my name is biggie plots

this is Rebecca our bart is van Lancer

Eagle Talon the seventh for that the

donkey is named Skyler and that's Sofia

I feel like in other circumstances we

would totes all be friends and have like

game nights and things like you guys

could come over to our house once we

rebuild it once we get this 50,000 gold

you owe us and we could all hang out and

I feel like we'd all get along so well

uh Eva Winky you like check if they're

evil and the donkey says making fists

that ain't gonna happen tonight wait why

is the donkey talk I'm not I'm not

familiar with the the PTM of acquisition

incorporated

what is it was the P team in charge of

and is it like alphabetical like is the

season like a piece o what you say I

missed it keeping the peace keeping the

peace got it okay I'm gonna I wanna I

want to like speak like whisper to the

the spookie ookie cloud person uh-huh

just be like congratulations you passed

the test

woman sends his regards we were checking

to make sure that you've been keeping up

with your duties can I roll deception

yes please

that is a 29 she says you're out of

uniform well how do you you would have

known off the bat

I see yes very well then there is

nothing happening here all operations

have been moved to other locations due

to the security breach all sensitive

areas have been dismantled yes and

impossibly race aisles have been

delivered elsewhere to that that one

location that I would assume they would

be at can you confirm I do not have

sufficient rank for that information

good good very well carry on done well

today but word will come back to omen

about you yes you see the donkey is

looking very suspicious at all this we

should vacate the premises but the

female Roth gnome seems satisfied and

you can't really see what the Kangoo is

thinking well very well P team can't

cooperate someone's that we are no match

for you we will be on our way

and the the zombie just sort of gives an

off-key strum you tune that thing

immediately it is that is dreadfully out

of tune and he just gives it a little

blink at you like he doesn't care

fair enough and you can tell that looked

like one of his ears is a sort of half

hanging off it's kind of been stitched

on multiple times the other one's all

sort of caved in

so if he can even hear what he's playing

you're not even sure any smells aren't

really bad art is subjective so it is

not formulaic so as far as I'm concerned

that was beautiful I just I there's a

lot going on here I don't think we're

going to get our money or the road back

no I don't think we are

it's getting late let's reconvene back

at the house the house and discuss this

further as if area says

corralled you had no business bringing

them here you had no business being on

this premises and we are well within our

right to destroy you but we will let you

live this once he's with us it's fine

yeah we hired him he's our clerk now

yeah your loss but also like do you just

kill people here like I don't I feel

like that's up that's a bit harsh right

biggie plots the gnome says we have been

tasked with providing security during

the repairs but where we have to follow

in our function and do what we have been

told we would almost certainly be

disciplined who is going to discipline

you Lord Tron yes we know that

now now colleague the facade is over we

know everything that's going on and they

are in on this too so there's no need

for such a ruse strikes I will take your

silence as agreement very well all right

you you met you get outside and you can

see that the P team is sort of watching

you through windows yeah let's um let's

just keep the start making our way back

to the house I think guys round I don't

see us getting a whole lot of solutions

tonight mm-hmm and I think this is also

much worse than we realize

now you can make insight checks having

sort of collected yourselves outside

just to see if you glean any sort of

unspoken truths about what you just see

yeah there's a lot of nonsense going on

yeah okay donkey was talking to me and

I'm just having it's true

ruff I'm having a rough time processing

that I got 20 wow it's good my dice are

killing it tonight I got to be team okay

I got 11 okay Dan you were it fascinated

by all the trash and the trash armor and

of course the talking donkey and the

clockwork rats and all these other

distractions you weren't really paying

much attention to anything beyond the

rat and the trash and the dockets

you know I didn't even need that but

everything else you get the sense that

Ziff area underneath that dark cloud

probably was what she said she was an

elf just masked in her behind the cloak

of the queen of air and darkness

whatever the hell that is but you get

the sense that what she told you about

the security breach was probably

accurate that as soon as the defenses

went down on this place Ohman had

everything rerouted taken offline moved

elsewhere shut down so that would any

showed any of the city watch stick their

noses into his business they wouldn't

find anything incriminating the Lord

remark may have been some sort of slip

of the tongue indicating some level of

power that has not been conveyed to you

so far about what omens ability is or

reach within the city their terror of

him is absolutely genuine he is he is

Darth Vader esque in terms of the fear

that he's conjured in his employees and

[Music]

they'll count their lucky stars if they

still have jobs tomorrow

beyond that you don't get the impression

that any of the P team really knew

anything about clones or nothing like

that these guys literally probably were

just told keep an eye on the structure

keep strangers out and mind your P's and

Q's

I don't know why all these people are so

afraid of omen he seems nice enough to

me he's always been very kind to me

well a lot of times the kindest people

the ones who wield their power the most

ferociously hmm I know we've been

looking forward to this money so we

could finally repair the house and do

all these things but I I think if it's

just you also get walnut that extra cash

yeah thank you Chris I know I think

there's a bigger problem here if there's

a if there's a there's a fake wall not

going around and I guess normally I'd

say that's really not our problem but

now do you have met walnut yeah

and and dealt with her more than once

and your feeling is

she would not be happy to know that

she's been cloned if she knew at all

right so I don't know if walnut even

knows about this and if there is a fake

wall not going around who knows what

she's doing and again normally it's

probably not our problem but with your

insight checks you would also get the

sense that if the clone of walnut if

wall not is basically walnut it wouldn't

be happy about being clone

baybel maybe being a clone either they

would have the same emotional reaction

that Walmart right we should find the

walnut clone we should find walnut yep

she is our friend and well yeah yeah

anyway I guess at least I think she's

our friend I don't know as far as she

knows she's our friend

and I think plus we just gave this fake

wall - incredibly powerful robe and I

think the moment that happens it tangent

Lee kind of became one of our problems

yeah it might put her in danger too not

knowing who she is or what she has it

could put a lot of people in danger

well let's try to find her let's go ask

around where we saw her last well or if

you were walnut where would you go from

this house well I was thinking like the

forest there's got to be like a park or

something in the city there are there is

the city cemetery which is it's also the

city's park it is closed at night there

is a park in the C Ward

at the north end of the city that's

smaller more like a just a walking park

with a Grove in it I don't think she

noted the cemetery I think she'd go to

the Grove she wouldn't go anywhere that

was close she likes rules yeah I think

she has some agenda that's beyond

anything that we can really know right

now if she had the she had the knowledge

of this deal she came to us directly to

obtain this cloak so she could have it

for her own purposes either to wield it

or to sell it herself so I don't you

think she thinks she's walnut just doing

her job

I I don't know I don't know how this

works

Strix what kind of alchemy would even

like would be required and like I don't

know how this stuff works I've been

thinking about that this whole time and

I'm gonna Arcana check that okay oh

that's actually really good 26 and what

is it what's the question that you want

answered how would they have even cloned

wallet well your your role is high

enough to know that there there is a

high level magic a clone spell it is at

least an eighth possibly ninth level

spell all right so on the order of like

a wish or you know something about right

you've also heard that clones can be

temperamental particularly when they are

created or in the presence of their

they're identical opposite a clone

cannot abide it's normally a clone

cannot abide whatever it is copying

I guess the only other instance where

that's not true that we've seen has been

mansion right well mansion had a

simulacrum essentially a loosely copy of

himself made of slush and snow a clone

is identical to the creature that it

duplicates in every way all right

so with the knowledge oh but it doesn't

gain knowledge the same once after it's

created it becomes its own entity and

learns separately but would we know that

she would think that she was the real

walnut a clone would instinctively be

aware if there was another walnut there

so it probably knows it's a clone all

right so claw oh na na knows well not is

not walnut now walnut real walnuts

wouldn't know that the Cologne has been

created but if she were to come across

it obviously that would change things

right or if somebody if some knowledge

of that were suddenly made known to her

in some other game say well I think we

should definitely try to get word to

walnut I agree I don't I don't know how

much we will be able to really do

ourselves right now because we have our

own things that we gotta take care of

and we're running out of time we should

ask the C team to come help us I'm gonna

write up the only letters and helps us

yes okay thanks can I please send a

letter okay fine it was like only go to

OMA nor could I send it like to someone

else

I mean I'm gay yeah I think it probably

has some limits on it but it basically

works like a sending spell so if Strix

knows the name of the individual i guess

you can just send it directly to walnut

if you wanted I feel like especially if

they're an oh you have acquisitions

incorporated like so write up a letter

and stuff it in here and we'll send it

to walnut walnut make sure to

ut not n ot no okay

hold on I'm gonna write this down dear

walnut our real friend I will raise

Aniyah our concern that we I mean do I

just come right out and say it

yes that we met your clone and you might

not know she exists also she completed a

contract on behalf of AK ink and took

our magical cloak

so now AK ink owes us 50,000 gold and we

don't have it in our house is still

broken and our kids have no roof over

there you gotta tell her only the first

25 words I probably get through that one

sentence

so far two sentences

just quick word of concern if we were

concerned no don't write this okay if a

clone is identical in any way how do we

know this will go to the real walnut not

the clone I mean I think the sending

spell works to send to the individual

right yeah but no because the clones

name is walnut

okay not like just because you call some

10th it's the intent also here here D if

you are looking to be the one to put it

into the Hat so it says send to it you

can send it to a creature with which you

are familiar so you can choose to send

it to the walnut that you think is the

real moment yes did you do it you know

walnut the

Steve spent the most time with walnuts

so if you put the liner in the Hat it

should go to the right walnut okay

I'm gonna concentrate real hard on okay

Oh am i done i I didn't I didn't right

that's good now let me write it okay

tons and we are generally sorry about

all this

yikes crew was that good

oh wait please write back PS please

write back or come help soon okay bye

you take it back you shove it in the Hat

and it disappears okay well I guess

that's the best we can do for on that

for now we happy to see Alana walking

around with a robe right a lot of money

or looking very expensive to bring a lot

of expensive stuff we need to intercept

her and find out what's going on but we

also can't forget about all the other

things I listed off earlier today those

also seem like important things that we

need to take care of

and just to be clear suing a kink is

still someone on the table idea you know

it's we have such a good case I'm not a

lawyer it just it just seems like some

pretty big fish scuse me and that's

where I will stop oh boy alright thank
