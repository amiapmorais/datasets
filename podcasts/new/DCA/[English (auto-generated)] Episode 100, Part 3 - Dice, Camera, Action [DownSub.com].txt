hey we're back in red larch

let's see what happened previously Milo

well stuff with things

evylyn and paltin came to the drawn and

corty on invitation from omen drum not

realizing that Ullman had sent a missive

to walnut on grass preparing for their

arrival I'm Chris Perkins your humble DM

and I'll be running this particular show

and picking up where Jerry left off and

to my left we have got ripping the

grandeur of Lysander evylyn maar thing

the Paladin and next to her Dragonborn

narcissist

Denard Blitzen to my riot rocking the

bard hard palton SEPA and representing

the natural world walnut dung crass the

crow all right the mist has enshrouded

the tavern the mercy killers who crept

inside have all been smacked down into

the floor profit gives them disapproving

glances what do you do nothing could you

give us the Hat up in here this miss

look gross uh I don't know what a Hut's

gonna do but sure I know like I'm just

all right throw up behind where like the

magical dome Springs around paltin in

the middle of the top room I assume I'm

assuming you're also so dinar and walnut

you see I was battling motion to them

like come on I'm distracted by this

hideous ballgown the spectral ball gown

that I'm in but yeah I'll dive into the

the hut yeah okay I'm out of my depth so

yeah just a lumber over confusedly yes

as soon as you pass into the hut to the

ballgown sort of disperses like it's

pushed out thank God and it just sort of

evaporates into nothing and you are

hiding out in this thing prophet patient

of mine she's dragging the mercy killers

into the back room just so they're not

splayed out all over the floor

very good don't even wrap them up in

like a rug and then drag them so don't

bleed on their way in

so you're camped out in your little hut

this temperature-controlled dome of

magic mm-hmm in the middle of the

taproom sea welcome first time in the

hut you know please make yourself out

get comfy

there's of the hut clearly beverages

will not be provided hopefully you got

that memo before entering the hut

anything you say or do in the hut will

be closely monitored and possibly used

against you if so need be and let's hope

we don't die what was that mist yeah is

it still out there they're filling up

the barn so some of it is sort of

creeping in under the floorboards but

not in a way that's sort of creating

visibility issues in here it seems to be

for the most part confined to outside

yeah it's good

you seem to know what it was Bolton what

do you think it is oh you know just

maybe maybe one of the SFX guys went

overboard with a smoke machine and like

no one told him to kill it or you know

maybe we're gonna go back to the bad

place I don't go to bad place oh okay

worse outside you hear the clatter of a

horse and wagon clop clop clop of the

hooves and the sound of the rickety

grinding back and forth the squeaky

wagon huh I'm sure that's fine sure it's

just delivery passing by you know it

stops

I'm sure as I'm in front I'm sure it's

going to the establishment across the

street you hear a knock on the door I'm

sure I'm sure that's somebody else

knocking who is it

I'd not you hear the knock again can we

see from the window back later please

how the angles sort of wrong yours

through the window you're kind of

staring out into some fog if if we even

wanted to could we open the door because

probably man yeah yeah okay it's like

we're good thank you

who is it I have to meet you oh okay you

hear a voice outside it is I dr. Rudolph

an ricktum the what the HUD just zoom

dissipate see palton just gets up and

walks straight to the door camera the

door you can see is nailed shut with

those glass nails so I can't open that

it's pretty secure it's like there might

be a back door you're lucky I can't open

this dude is that you palton do you

think he says you have nothing to fear

for me I come with a warning come with a

death wish buddy isn't about the mercy

killers we already got the morning what

do you want - I want to come inside I

want you to come inside - but currently

that is not possible

he says then we shall have words here on

the threshold

my desire my kind of tide you are in

greater danger than you know Oh an

ancient evil is going to visit self upon

you okay and I have rushed ahead of it

well good for you

well you want to give me more details

than that or are we gonna be ominous all

day he says it has to do with the ring

you see an ancient ring reborn in the

ritual that I performed to save your

friends dear fans tricks do you still

have the Rings you do I fear your doom

do I still have the Rings

nope well then we're fine cuz we don't

have the Rings right what are they what

if we did hypothetically have those

rings she's who am I talking to

yeah who is he talking to I'm talking to

her adoring right um I am walnut of

acquisitions incorporated I'm not

familiar with that place you know why

that's hilarious

I'm not from around here you see

well happy to make your acquaintance

what if we did have one of those rings

then I fear the dark powers that have

manifested its flesh we'll be coming for

it soon so whoever has the Rings or what

or what they're after

he says the ritual that I used to save

your friends and bind the soul of your

good friend evil in in the bandhas was

an old Bustani wedding ritual first

performed in the ancient times even

here's wedding and goes that's that

evylyn yes she's here too

but you know I'm still alive

well I'm sorry how are your eyes

actually I don't know about that never

minds

and he says you haven't much time

good luck I wish you well great

always a pleasure this is so helpful

what why don't you stay for cornerstones

and and talk yeah yeah can we let this

guy in actually that sounds like a great

idea he seems like he'd be a big help

how do we open this window yeah do or

you can try to you could get profit or

about the Navi through the kitchen yeah

or that okay cool there's a side door

where yeah let's do that that sounds

your shooter on the side okay great cool

maybe just you know you do what you need

to do but maybe just like you hear the

horse and wagon leave but you also hear

the crunch of grass and dirt as somebody

makes their way around the side of the

building okay I'll get it even though

his doctor at the door it's like she

goes to let him in okay seems super

helpful when you open up the door and he

sees you there you can see well he's got

eyes you can see you even when he is as

you last remember him a small man

old white wispy hair kind of frail sort

of in the final years of his life he's

got a trench coat on sort of a brown

trench coat and he's got a walking stick

a black ebony walking stick with a

silver wolf head and spectacles perched

on the bridge of his nose

and he says you know alive which is nice

see again there's only a matter of time

yeah meet once more I'm glad you think

so it's kind of I'm gonna admit it's a

little weird seeing you after all that

but glad you're okay too I wish I were

here under better circumstances I'm

afraid I'm somewhat at fault for this

situation that it's about to be visited

upon you seems like it's not often

you're here under hostel room together

so everybody else present and he says I

am dr. Rudolf

victim I kill serviced he's a dick

doctor no I'm a vampire I gotta talk you

know what I am a vampire hunter it's not

as cool as he says and a cleric of the

morning Lord that's that part is

actually as lame as it sounds hey no

offense you're you're you're fantastic

keep keep keep it up hmm

and you can see he's got this sort of

Sun symbol amulet

Evelyn's just kind of nervously hovering

like not between falton and bhendrickson

but like around to make sure things stay

copacetic

Paul's just just eyeing him literally

just like going over all the options

he's just like a you sort of aware of

the Animus that is brewing it's like

within you hey so let's do you want to

settle this now get it out of the way

maybe smash my face into a table a few

times throw me across the bar oh you

knew how to talk dirty to me I think we

don't need to do any smashing maybe you

could just kind of give us the

information you came to give us about

dark powers and all that he says there

are evils greater than vampires the

evils that birthed the dark realms of

Ravenloft into being they are the dark

powers they are the ones who bring the

mists around the domains and trap their

lords inside them mm-hmm two of those

powers are now manifest in the world you

see why did you do that I'm afraid I did

when I came back virtual what so it's

your fault yes entirely hmm the the

ritual with the rings and the me in the

process yes

now dark powers is it my fault too no no

you're good it's his fault he did the

ritual all you do is not die

these beings are these beings are

actually irredeemably evil

so when you say manifest you mean like

walking around they have not existed

materially for ages and being material

kind of helps them do worse stuff worse

than murdering my parents who were

murdered he's the man who murdered my

parents for those who aren't caught up

just wanting to like give that little

exposition that's why okay anyway carry

on sir

he says lash ghana and lydia that is

what they were called when they were

alive they were reversed I mean you see

married in an ancient ritual they hail

from two different tasks tasks yes think

of them as alliances of tribes they were

married yes what happened to them

they died why they were killed by

members of their own tasks why because

it was a dark time and they were evil

and their union would have spelled doom

for the Bustani at risk of being an

original why he says because love makes

people do crazy things you see and they

were very much in love

an ancient love a true love mmm have you

ever experienced true love just looks at

the floor like everyone I think just a

hair I have and the things that you will

do for love

far greater than the things you will do

out of hate you look at me for

I'd love to end this right now if that's

what you're getting at

he says I don't think got a few years

left if you want to end it now then do

it the hearts too easy

Stewie no he knows I won't pick the

low-hanging fruit I'll think of

something

come back to me so they are drawn to the

Rings

why because the Rings are what they are

what tethers them to this reality sony

has not been able to touch each other or

be in each other's company a thousands

thousands of years but once they get the

rings they'll be together again

Campari Oh eternal let's give him the

rings guys did I mention their dark

powers maybe they won't feel so dark

once they have like you know all of

their lives back we can't give them

these rings Denari remember we need

these rings to free mail up from the

singular like my god did I know that yes

I told you I told you this many many

times wait you guys have two rings I

have it right here

oh man gave it to me actually Oh sky

like try to snatch it this is her most

prized possession it's right on our hand

so probably not dang it

oh man gave you those Oh intake give it

to me how did all me get the Rings do

you know you okay there buddy

you went down for a while say about all

this ring talk ohms like oh right yeah

um yeah he just kind of like just like

pieced out with them is heaven

it was kind of a dick move he just took

yeah I just took them and I'm sure no no

hang on oh man just stole rings that

were imbued with my soul

yeah he's a creep he's a weirdo man yeah

I'm sure he didn't steal them all I

wouldn't do that what do you call it

when you take something without

without permission oh that's stealing

but dia said we could keep them and that

it was fine dance he said we could keep

it until we did our ritual that would

free my god I wasn't I wasn't there for

any of that I also wasn't there

yes he is very late he's the one to

throw on me he did taking our money well

he took money

yeah that's nor that the point is do you

have money I do have this ring and it

can't an omen it's to help us release a

god yeah and I can shmoney I can't give

it up well I guess technically the ring

is D s so he well it sounds like the

ring those omens because he stole it

because apparently that's how that would

be instead she could have it then she

can have it it's dance to give I suppose

even though my souls in it but I guess

nobody do you have that in writing where

are DF these strings probably somewhere

fantastic and wonderful and not horrible

and why don't they have you the Rings

ideas bottom office apparently are we

sold them to us we gave him money in

good faith that we would use these

strings for our purposes and then when

we were done and the rest of the soul

pieces that may be in them were released

we would get that money back any of this

that doesn't tell us we we all kind of

don't tell each other a lot of stuff we

might have some he goes over to the bar

and pours himself a drink of wine as

soon as you've dollars in like mid cents

I'm just like it sounds like I have some

like communication things going on

there's another glass of your like takes

that one it's like flashes it on his

face about like even looking

communication is key I want to know who

is coming for them so that I can be

ready for them because they certainly

aren't getting this ring I didn't he

just kind of explained it

he says lashka of them anew so we'll go

after one okay the dear

- will come out the other okay well how

hard could it be

Oh famous last words

what's it like outside miss D yeah

opaque so the big question I sort of

look over toward the door dinar you see

one of the nails push itself out and go

pink down onto the floor oh no it just

slides out like ya think is that normal

does that always happen I go pick it up

I'm stuck anywhere yeah hmm give the

profit and I do yeah he had it to her

and by the time that one has been handed

off another one slides up what are we

supposed to do about these dark powers

if they're so powerful what is it they

think we can do about it he says I can't

do anything well then why did you come

warn us because it's all I can do

cool so you just wanted us to know that

our navigable do was come he says you'll

have to work it out with them I'm sure

we can do that

mmm can we destroy the Rings bad we're

not gonna destroy the ring he says

absolutely hey that sounds good

I'm solved yeah that's fine is there a

way no wait no that's never mind I mean

well you know you and I are on the same

page now there's a different page now

Jay Jay to the king if you if you split

a soul and then you destroy part of it

is it like a like I mean I don't know

how that works

what do I know how that works make a

religion 18 so you had a piece of your

soul torn away from you and then split

into two rings you don't know what

happens when the ring is destroyed maybe

that soul goes back to you or maybe just

goes maybe just ceases to exist

and what do I know if like a person with

a little less than a whole soul has any

problem um like kidneys there are people

yeah there are serve their people with

broken souls by the

necessarily you know deny them any

happiness or place in the afterlife

because I don't know that that fragment

of soul were to be say captured by

someone who had untoward intentions

toward it they could use it for fel

purposes okay so it's maybe just like

not super simple because we you know my

soul is kind of in there part of it I

agree we should not destroy the ring and

they wouldn't like that very much

I'm just weighing out our options both

in like but then what happens if the

this ring that has someone's soul in it

it's taken by these these are these

these spoopy powers and they well what

happens then don't then they can live

out the life that they were denied okay

so what's that mean for the soul the

person whose soul is in the ring I don't

know god you're just a big bag of help I

know more than you it's just like math

equations in front of them just like

going through everything yeah yeah

borrowed okay there's Chennai right cool

I don't eat glass nails are going and

they all gone now I only oh yeah pretty

much the door hazard don't take it

outside if you're gonna fight don't

break anything I put my hand on my sword

okay it was sort of like that Ottoman

one of them are you trying to be like no

one I don't know what to do I don't know

see outside through the window even

through the fog what appear to be like

distant torch lights like how many no

couple okay from your point of view it's

hard to see that many oh look distant

torch like that must be helpful maybe

it's lashka oh well they have torches we

don't know doctor exposition healthy

and he he doesn't know but you see that

from behind the bar he sort of undoes

the top of his cane and draws out a

silver sword from what they met tonight

okay I'm gonna turn into a wolf at this

point and do uh do a perception check on

base on snow very good go ahead rather

take a 16-3 okay with that room you can

you smell torches and pitch quite a lot

out there and you also smell familiar

smells people and well you smell of the

town of red larch obvious how you're

accustomed to that the cattle and all

the other rest of it but then you do

with your keen Wolf's senses pick out

that there are at least 30 people

approaching the drownin Cordy all right

so fire up the grill so my hackles

raised and I start a low growl and I get

into a like a stance what's that girl

something about a well yeah great how

many scratching at the ground yeah I

can't communicate in wolf arm other than

to show you that on the door opens

slowly and standing in the doorway is a

man with a fiddle tucked under his arm

and he sort of portly and maybe in his

60s 70s and have withered or withered

fingers

knotty fingers and a bushy white

mustache and a scruffy beard and with

like

big Tufts of hair off the sides of his

head and he just sort of looks around

nods and walks inside yes hello

this is not my home but I welcome you

greetings my name is Daka tell me about

welcome I'm going to just sit somewhere

is that okay it's not my place go for it

you can see unlike the mercy killers

where profit kind of knew what she was

dealing with here this is just bizarre

to her and so she's got her weapon handy

but she sort of nods to a stool by the

door

do I smell anything weird on him there

you smell pipe weed clinging to him

pretty heavily and nail he might be

drunk okay all right you know like like

pop squad next to him yeah and as he

sits there he sort of gets his fiddle up

and he sort of this makes these plan

sound like a very dramatic I'm gonna

like mimic it on the on the really yeah

yeah yes all right

he tries to up you with the strings and

he's got his bow raking across his

instrument to make a performance check

okay as he tries to help do you mean

time even is at first like we don't have

tech mom concert 19 okay he coming

founds you with the speed of his of his

hands and the fluidity of his music

you're you're a little taken aback it's

like like one string breaks any place is

dramatic dunno

[Music]

get him out of here

yeah he came in from the fog my mustard

would be along shortly

I'm still there sir Nadia of the kalisch

oh this is his theme music yeah let's go

we shouldn't hang out okay man I'll say

that I'm just at the door like I'm at

the door yeah when you get to the door

and you look out you can see red largers

town smoke that you have passed and

associated with basically closing in

around the drawing and courtiers with

torches and pitchforks you can see a you

can see that the butcher this woman

looks her hair is sort of disheveled

like she just woke up and she's still in

her nightgown but she has a torch lit

that she's holding on to you can also

see that what the clothed the air is out

you've probably had business and

dealings with her there's a half-orc who

works at the smithy he's out you can see

he's got an apron on some soot on his

face and he's got a hammer in one hand

and a torch in the other

although you've seen these people time

and time again you've never seen the

looks on their faces as they are now it

they almost look like zombies puppets

okay I start making my way towards like

side door the kitchen door okay you can

see they're coming from the back -

what's that what's the fiddler guy doing

he is playing dramatic music

he keeps going I just want like grab it

and do like a and just hand it back okay

here Frank is fiddly smash it into

smithereens and he does sort of stare at

it and you even hear Van Rycke didn't

behind the bar go we should go is this

normal

like does this town have like a fun

festival where everyone comes to this

barn well yeah and you think that's all

the prowler seems to leach from your

surroundings and everything goes to

black and white

well they probably recognize this

phenomena right you've never seen

anything quite like this it's like you

literally just got transformed into a

50s movie hmm huh we should go that

one's new we yeah we're um yeah is there

any other good side good is there a go

through the roof can you guys fly

no no other forms sorry yeah then no I

profit says she's sting she's not

playing her yeah well how many are

ounces so there's 30 outside are they

all are on the building yeah it's it

seems to be most of the town's folk okay

so maybe more than 30 then yeah not all

of them have torches yeah okay maybe we

should just start talking to everybody

let's just clear all this out I'll just

fling her she flings open the door

people oh no no I immediately just no no

no saying okay I think here's what we'll

do and I'm gonna I give evylyn a little

Boop and cast greater invisibility she

disappears I can't see concentration oh

shoot I can't do what desire you were

trying to take stock of all the towns

welcome many people you know my name

you hear the sound of horses pulling

maybe coaches and it sounds like a lot

of them they must be coming down the

road which is so engulfed with fog you

can't even see it yeah there

theoretically according to doctor

exposition not after us there after the

rain can we who would know that I even

have a ring in this wolf form I I can't

say to you yeah I mean there's something

drawing them to it as my inference here

mm-hmm

so we could can we make the ring go away

somehow that musician pulls out a little

flute oh gosh that's plane fly away

disapprovingly yes I want to tell you

gonna be like okay you're invisible just

go like just go out the side door go

straight

because I can't both be invisible see

you go and get behind the crowd and then

I'll wait a couple minutes and then I'll

do the same and then I'll catch up to

you and then I don't know these guys are

like from a different show so it's

really maybe if we split up so yeah sure

growling and also they're important make

the wolf invisible if you're gonna make

things invisible make the thing with the

ring invisible yeah but they're gonna be

they're gonna be after the ring so then

may I see this billion doesn't matter

then theoretically how about I go create

a diversion distracted oh we don't need

that it's gonna be so great I'll just

five of them and I'll go behind them and

I'll create a diversion and then no make

a path and you all can follow I mean

you're great you're just gonna you're

probably gonna go do it anyway she finds

can she find like an open window or

something dude open on a doe and forth I

yeah she's got little winged boots yeah

she doesn't walk she flutters off um

yeah so she flies out the window and

tries to go like behind the crowd on one

side

okay can she do that absolutely yes you

can see that the fog is so thick the

farther you get out that you don't see

much

beyond like maybe a hundred feet around

this tavern okay just a few other

neighboring structures and other things

like a parked car tuna hedge and a few

small shrubs and things and then all the

people with torches and pitchforks that

have surrounded this place are there any

interest that you do hear the coming of

a coach hmm or two or three maybe I'll

go check that out

reel clanking there deep in the mist at

this point they're too far yeah okay

do I see anything interesting like large

objects animals nothing like that it is

a it is this place is literally engulfed

in the mists of Ravenloft as you know

them so things have taken on sort of a

grim quiet and there's the signs of life

that you come to expect you're just not

present hmm I grabbed the musician guy I

want to grab the music shake him yeah

and be like what are we looking at here

my master will be along shortly always

give me some give me something I can

work with and I push him hard against

the wall he's a very nice guy you'll

like him walk hey that's pretty nice

guys we could have this all wrong even

what he wants Oh

say we give him what he wants Oh does he

sounds like a great guy he's waited a

long time for this oh yeah long time

emotion as this guy's talking he's don't

come around every lifetime you know

while he's talking I listen to the

doctor exposition link just what's do

you read on this I say to him he plays

well hmm they roughed him up some

worries I just starts playing them again

stuff

yeah dinars just sort of dragging him

across like yeah tables and things

absent mindedly as I think shaking I'm

like a little angle yeah I mean I'm

gonna talk to the van Rycke dinner like

so so if these things get their hands on

the Rings that's bad news right that is

what they want they want to live again

okay again yeah cool that's all nice do

people die in that process

does bad things happen to other people

perhaps if you give him the ring he'll

just leave but I have never dealt with

creatures this powerful before you

summon them

these are unearthly beings but I know

this to them love is all that is all

that they know love for each other and

anything that stands between them will

die okay cool so just so we clarify I

actually don't have the ring that would

be this one so I'm in-between nothing

just for you know full transparency

full disclosure um I don't know what you

wanted oh wait you still Wolfer yeah I

can

she turned back into a wall not give up

that sweet wild shape for the day and I

say listen your friends soul is in this

ring I need this ring I'm not giving up

this ring well who's ever coming we can

deal with them we have four of us and I

don't know if you know but we're pretty

powerful that's that's adorable

okay well I at this point I'm like fully

aware that this is you know burrow via

this nonsense yes it's like okay cool

that's adorable first of all like like

way further along the whole wise bt-dubs

but also and I don't want to mess with

this I absolutely something that you

know or you've come to realize now and

if you don't man rectum will tell you is

that because you have Bustani blood that

you can go through the mist mm-hmm oh

that's right cool

so right interesting and even still like

our evil and you're flying around out

there as you sort of sink deeper into

the mist you feel the life being choked

out of you Oh fine hmm okay yeah me

even when you say it further into the

mist is the mist less concentrated the

further you get away from the drama in

court here the thicker the mist becomes

to the point of being just opaque where

when you fly into it you can't see more

than a few inches in front of your eyes

and the crowd is not affected by the

mist

the crowd seems to have come out of the

message is not affected but they're

currently not in the thick of it and if

I like grab someone's hat or something

impossible that they followed the mist

in there they're super zombie-like right

so I'm like flitting around and visiting

to try to grab something off of one of

them yeah I want to like mess with one

of them to see if they react okay they

do you can see that they get angry okay

so she starts trying to shoot she

doesn't spend too long having the life

choked out of her but she starts just

creating like havoc in the crowd a

little bit chaos like grabbing this

guy's torch and throwing it at that guy

taking this person's hat and lighting it

on fire

yeah like nothing to see this little

well you'll you'll just have greater

invisibility so you don't turn back so

it's just you just see out there and

what's a couple torches get thrown off

and into the mist and some people

knocked down and things like that okay

distraction force right yeah I'm the

ghost of Romeo pass I will I don't know

you're doing great you got this we all

believe think okay you should give me

that ring I'm not giving you this time

you should give me the ring this is it's

called a home-field advantage I know

this better than anyone else here

and as much as I hate stepping up you

need to give me that or else

dick there's a good chance we all die

what are you gonna do with it I need it

back I'm gonna I'm gonna I don't want to

keep it I just want to need to figure

out like how to keep this from getting

it to him and I can I can get through

this better than anybody else can why

when they see so special

I just gave like a really good monologue

big weights even like if you want to say

here in severe I guys have missed come

through and as they emerge they solidify

like they they were ghosts before but

now they're not and they take on the

likeness of horses and wooden coaches

and they're all gypsy Rivard awakens

from the Bustani and you can see at the

helm of the lead vardø wagon is a dragon

born who looks familiar

or no no yeah

well that's cool the other thing you

notice about him is that he appears to

be almost translucent Wraith like hmm

ethan pokes our head in the window just

click update coaches are coming kind of

ghosty Dragonborn drivers looks like a

whole caravan coming through town big

caravan distraction forces causing chaos

I don't know if it's helpful ok I'll

keep going by dragged it over a nice

it's like like I thought something been

there's I'm I'm volunteering to step up

and I have beliefs and stay here hey

y'all are stuck here at whatever is

coming you don't stand a chance and if I

want to I can just peace out but I'm not

doing that

137 ok so will not see you Angus

I need this ring back can you give me

your word that I will get this ring back

when we get through this yeah do I trust

this guy

Casas on a truth yes yes oh yeah go

ahead well whenever it's convenient can

even go examine the wagons further yes

you can see they come to a stop on the

road and the Dragonborn gets off of the

drivers bench hops down and stands next

to the coach as a man gets out and this

man is

he looks like somebody important

he's wearing a top hat he's wearing

beautiful tailored outfit you can see

however there's sort of a bright crimson

plume tucked into his hat and he takes

it off and throws it into the couch and

sort of pushes his black mane of hair

back away from his face and advances

toward the tavern does he look familiar

no but there's something about him that

suggests this is a form that has been

chosen not a form but is true it's just

too otherworldly in the way he moves and

Holt composes himself as distraction

force engineer I noticed that there is

now no driver in the seat and no

passenger in the carriage and I would

like to take the driver's seat okay and

try to drive the carriage into mayhem

sure like a animal handling you know we

should give away a prize for that let's

get let's give away a prize for the sad

one that

so as you snap these reins nothing

happens the horses stubbornly do not

move an inch all right our prize is jack

box party pack Elderwood

mini hex chests well that's a mouthful

D&D beyond legendary bundle enjoy my

pain well all those things right now

it's like magic thank you trying to

think how we can flee okay we can phase

shift we could go to the test market do

we have any more of those gold coins

anything we make one we made one last

time I don't have anything

I can't sign in my my sweet children

right now reachny golden to make one

whatever you guys are ready

well alright to settle your argument

I'll zone will catch on the truth okay

I'm like holding the room

I'm gonna cast it on a truth in the room

okay

is that something I'm aware of you have

seen the spell cast yes when it goes off

you realized if you talk you will be

compelled to tell the trick all can I

counter spell yes agreed and it senses

under third level you're automatically

successful saved you I'm just like deep

eye it's like dude I don't play that

 well you look like a liar hired

space it's like all right you know what

fine see you around

and he just walks out the door you walk

into mmm-hmm this man mmm-hmm

and he just sort of stands in your path

and you look him up and down he looks

you up and down he even though you're

about the same height and composure

there's something about him that

suggests age yeah he doesn't look like

an old man but there's something in his

eye suggests oh he's he's been around a

few blocks when you look at him he looks

you up and down intently mm-hmm do I say

he's another of astana guy yes and I

like know this I just kind of link to it

and instantly I like looking on I just

like kind of give him the he stands to

the side and allows you to pass I'm just

walking you see out front this coach

with these invisible rains lashing

frantically and nothing happens I will

go to this College okay so you head out

to the coach the man having let paulten

leave enters the establishment and feels

something as soon as he enters like some

sort of magic and he stands there you're

holding his musician probably like by an

ankle

strangling this guy lightly the entire

time yeah it's just absent-minded yeah

and so he he looks around the room and

then fixates on you

how does prophet and dr. Exposition

react you can see dr. exposition is

looking a little concerned he is not

reacting he's trying to keep his cool

and see what transpires but he looks

battle ready for an old guy he looks

like he's ready to spring into action

prophet of course likewise you can see

that she has moved to a place where

there's no furniture blocking her path

to the man I mean I'm trying to get a

read on dr. expeditions the one who's

been dropping all the info on this so

far so I'm trying to get cues from him

because I don't know that dinar wouldn't

know like dinner I mean Brian knows but

I have deniers no reason to know what

this is about you a Dragonborn pushes

and sort of behind him it just sort of

fills the doorway and you can see

through this Dragonborn he is a dragon

born wraith as far as you know but he's

actually walking on the floor you can

hear his heavy footfalls they come up

the stoop and he stands there in the

doorway semi-solid and just sort of

glares back with these mercurial silvery

eyes I gave him the link then

know-it-all Dragonborn know a wink that

they give to each other he does not

reciprocate he does not return Wow wink

dist ya know it suggests something you

didn't see there's like wisps of shadow

kind of coming off his scales shout

around head Dragonborn been there buddy

yeah it actually that when you see him

yeah it's like that oh yeah yeah harkens

back to that yes okay ah can I help you

the ring

I've come for it you have it give it to

me it's mine it's it I don't want to get

into it there's been a lot about this

ring today this is my ring I'm keeping

it I need it I'll burn the place to the

ground okay you're not gonna get this

ring

can step outside and we can settle this

and I step outside and settle this I say

take your man and I throw the fat music

guy head and I say I push her matches

them yeah say I say you served us take

care of him you you get out of here you

take him you go now completely ready to

walk out that the and I'm like yeah

dinar great at this point I'm at the

carriage with evylyn right uh yes

okay you can hear her I'm just like hey

so I tried to bluff him into giving me

the ring and I didn't realize that they

were here so now they are in there

probably trying to get the ring oops oh

good god okay I I am in can you tell

this horse to go um can i you climb up

hon to thee and take the reins make an

animal handling just sure that's

probably not good dr. Dolittle's I'm not

doing that okay

these horses are not budging for either

of you and do you follow them outside

yeah I guess so I was not in followed

but I will stick of walnut dr. Rudolph n

reckon we'll go out with you um so the

three of you are standing outside with

this man and his Dragonborn bodyguard

uh-huh

and he says let's get this over with I

have somewhere else to be

did they seem Alton in in their carriage

you see palton on the carriage we do

today they if they do they don't seem to

care okay

and they definitely don't see no I

thought as far as you can tell okay so

you see the rest of it you guys you to

see

that they come out are now standing in

front of the in I'm assuming really

there's like this the mob is like all

gathered round yes like a street fight

yes this is rocky v yes no fight Tommy

gun no it's bad they shouldn't have

those things and to be honest you're

solving it is the only thing the man

snaps his fingers and the people come in

with their torches and start to light be

in on fire

I cast watery spirits

okay that's real initiative I mean I can

cast your spear and then I go left

okay so dinar rules of what total two to

one technically hey - - Maya wanna seven

seven

evylyn 1818 and pull 1770 alright so

while not you cast your sphere yeah

how big is it ten-foot radius great and

I can move it 30 feet and it just sort

of rolls like across the rent okay so uh

where do how do you want to cast it

what's your aim here I cast it like like

I clip it into the end okay so the idea

is to basically douse is the ethanol and

water is possibly out to make sure the

flames don't catch yes that's like

sloshing yeah so you should be able to

do just with this in this first and you

can concentrate on I assume so as soon

as it appears and it starts to move you

kind of wet down one side

for the building great on this turn and

then it is hauntings sorry even's turn

so you see walnut cast a sphere of water

that begins to roll and put out flames

that are being lit around the building

on one side there still fires being lit

on the other two sides and just to

clarify these people that are setting it

on fire I am clearly under the

impression that they're not doing this

of their own free will right that seems

to be the indication yes

[Music]

do I have any indication of who is

controlling them yeah the man who just

snapped his fingers and cranked this all

to happen then that's the guy who had

the plume yep okay um that's going about

the earth right the deer dark power

lover boy

she's gonna stay invisible can i it's

greater invisibility so I can attack

invisible right yes you stay invisible

so the duration of the the spell do my

weapon stand visible just for fun oh

yeah yeah your weapons visible okay well

I can't have them burning down the place

and I can't hurt the people who are

doing this of their own free will so I

mean what what Google cares is being

burned down like what it's a building

even whispers and takes the artist

Benelli ignites it and tries to

invisibly stab him in the back okay the

guy at the pub yeah okay go ahead I

think I do

how long's that last I think it's well I

think he used it yeah that's a 15 okay

well he's not wearing any armor so you

are able to strike him with nothing he

doesn't know he doesn't know it's coming

either right yeah yeah

skills of birdie a very irony sensation

coming through his back let's see a

doctor about that and I'm doing less

divine smite as well at a first level so

she whispers and she does that was 20

with my modifier plus 34 yeah 34 34 okay

and it's partly fire and partly radiant

he seems to take all of it yeah and my

first attack okay I have make your

second yeah so she she's gonna do it

from a different angle to so it's more

confusing like what what is burning me

that's an 18 that is it cool and this is

a dark power right so even feels pretty

confident that it's something she should

fight and destroy right yeah as a

paladin with their divine sense there

there is something just just impossibly

evil about the thing in front of you

okay so definitely divine smiting at

once again so that's gonna be change 17

+ 22 22 thank you mm-hmm and then she

wouldn't have any movement left right so

she could yeah probably

okay okay paltin you see flames erupt

from this guy's chest and divine light

swell up inside of him with each blow

okay guess we're fighting

whoo okay so the problem is if I do

something the greater invisibility is

gonna wear off because that'll break my

concentration

yes so oh that's concentration mm-hmm

ten counterspell that it worked was that

a spell was that going on oh yeah shoot

something yeah well it played out fun

anyway yeah yeah really cool hey how's

the horse yeah I think I'm just gonna

just gonna play another little jam and

I'm gonna give give you fun some Bartok

inspiration cuz I'm just like it's gonna

be back in support I'm gonna also kind

of like slumped down so he doesn't see

me like ah yeah they're just like fair

all right mad at me earlier so okay and

so you're giving her inspiration uh-huh

so you get a d-10 on your Nexus Haeckel

sitting through our ability check and

then it is bad guys the Dragonborn

seeing that this is the way this is gone

will attack you evylyn can they when I'm

invisible yeah you just have this

advantage but he knows what square

you're in because he saw your weapons

okay it was just you know some divine

power no where does 16 hit you you know

okay so he comes at you with shadowy

claws and takes a couple swipes with his

claws but does not actually get you and

then he breathes a cone of necrotic

energy at you and I would like you to

make a next 36 or constitution safety

through how closer you mean but yeah

okay you take 42 necrotic damage Wow

your maximum hit points also go down by

42 double-dose necrotic energy in your

face no okay you said 48 42 42 off your

current have points in 42 off your

permanent for everyone's whoa all right

here with your inspiration wait that was

a saving throw so I could use my Bartok

inspiration you told me we could also

yes my aura yeah yeah yeah so you get a

plus 3 from my aura oh my gosh I'm about

to be saved

ok so I get my defend let's do that

first - ok so that's 4 plus my 6 is 10

plus my 3 3 plus 5 so 18 oh well ok

you take 21 damage and 21 off your okay

[Music]

all these auras over here got a heck of

an energy alright

the dear turns to you look straight at

you evylyn like you can see you mm-hmm

and suddenly you and he aren't there

anymore

oh they disappear no vivillon and here

gone The Shadow Dragon born is still

there hmm

and that's when Van Rycke tons him

through the back with his silver cane

sword and succeeds yeah and you can see

that this shadow dragon even though it's

a thin little weapon it's sort of

pierces right under through his scales

and causes him to shriek in pain

[Music]

and it staggers him for a second there

and then he turns around and glares at

the old man hatefully what would wall

not dump grass like to do it isn't a

nice turn

John he's dead last oh my dad - I'm

sorry

yeah then your water yeah we're still

trying to light the N on fire so then

I'll move it to another side yeah and

wet that okay and that'll be my hole

okay do you want tools at all or do you

want to just stay where you were

I'm just gonna stable think of it okay

do not um this this shadow Dragonborn

and what am I like what am i getting off

of this guy if anything just sheer

menace I mean is he he's not I'm not

getting any familial ty he's not related

um it would be very hard to tell

okay there doesn't see you don't sense

any recognition from him toward you

yeah which is crazy

who else is in the end where's prophets

telling me and she is in the end okay

right and actually she's probably going

around in slapping torches out of the

hands of people trying to light her and

um if I was gonna say cuz i i'm i guess

my presidency to get her out of the

burning house or a house that to me to

be burn out then take care of herself

build a new house yeah um well if she

was deep in the house I thought maybe

she wouldn't know that people trying to

light it on fire kind of shows get her

out okay

she got the first whiff of smoky woods

pet he have paladin and thinks of me now

ya hear her no slap no slap and I still

trying to light on fire well I was gonna

I won't try to command again I but I was

gonna Mike what I was gonna try to

command the do doesn't make sense now

cuz he's alone but I guess I could come

and let's see mmm nice big list of

command ideas I do

oh I have a whole big list of community

hmm

we can always do a classic flea but that

only well I don't he'll time it to take

a whole term running away and then a

whole turn running back give us a minute

to breathe sure if it even lands yeah

she's gone I was I was gonna heal to was

one of my other plays but she's out so

I'll try to command him I don't know

being this spectral weirdo if it's gonna

work but I'm gonna try to invoke in

command in doing this I'm gonna try to

like you know mystically get a little

sense of the blood here

like I'm trying to get a read on this on

this guy and then eyes light up and I

will say I'll safely I'll safely okay

he's gotta make a savior correct yep 14

okay were he to flee would that happen

immediately or has it happened on his

turn so he has to do it on his turn he

has to spend his turn doing what I told

him to do so when his turn comes around

he's gonna he as your voice reverberates

through him you can see that he sort of

shudders and takes steps back away like

he's going to flee yeah fear a feeling

he hasn't had in some time

mm-hmm and then we circle back around to

evylyn evylyn you are standing in a

graveyard looking at the graves of your

friends oh cool

Chris Perkins and you're with him is

this a graveyard I recognize you can see

that it is your family's graveyard like

that was that's attached to your a

family estate you know your grandmother

and be buried here so are your friends

and my parents presumably yes that's

disconcerting

and I'm with this dude is he saying or

doing anything

he's sort of looking down and staring at

the gravestone of DF and saying did you

love them of course I did I mean do I

mean what you want nothing from you and

he disappears and I'm left there yeah

yeah can I roll an insight check to find

out anything about where are you yeah

it's nice for once uh 23 you're in your

own domain of dread oh okay great great

great I was gonna command betrayal to

bite no no he wasn't there to betray me

here on the mist is Paulding yeah okay

so there's a there's a shadow dragon man

who is recoiling in fear from dinar

Blitzen

you are still on the I'm a coach you see

efforts to light the N on fire are not

meeting with any success at the moment

except on one side where there's some

smoke billowing up and then evylyn and

the evil men are gone

has he come back not yet

so all there really is is this this mob

and this this dragon dude yes do I have

do I like have any idea where they went

so give if he is what van Rycke didn't

said he is he is a dark power

his powers and Ravenloft are boundless

so he could have taken her anywhere

anytime cool great

Alton's gonna like he sees that he just

like gets up and goes to like where they

disappeared from he's just like looking

around and just like frantic it's just

like no no no no God okay um

that's not good that's not good that's

really not good okay um just seized the

dragon war is just like I guess him all

right I can't get to him and oh yeah you

can get to a measly a medal quick

question for you Ryan does with this

would an attack on him and the spell

fine know to use this early on god we

beat him up and they ran away thank you

beat him up if they were running just

like alright cool and I'm just gonna

like run up to him yep and then just

hold a hand to his face I'm just gonna

like thunder wave off his head this he

looks like a pretty pretty strong dude

he's a big guy yeah okay cool I'm

casting that dragon go ahead fifth-level

okay and if you can actually touch him

there's something sort of level I gotta

say he's sort of semi solid see your

hand kind of pushes into him a little

bit as you blast him in the face okay

interesting so that's uh they were all

the natural one on his savings rollin so

yeah I don't want the full brunt of your

thunder wave okay so go to the crown

that's it's a 68 okay roll them dice Oh

Wow hey you gonna 21 okay ow

he looks quite hurt at this point and he

just goes flying and he goes flying back

10 feet smashing up against the wall of

the inn hmm that was just like a rage

reaction just like just like can't can't

find her anger it's like got Johnny all

right and then it is his turn he sprouts

wings and takes cool the guy on his

shadowy wings okay yeah you run and see

that he's terrified

yeah he just takes to the air and flies

up to the edge of the mist hmm and

that's all that he can do and then scary

guy comes back hmm just appearing more

or less where he was before looks at

Walnut and says give me the ring

no you will not have this ring you will

not stand it between me and my true love

I won't allow any mortal to do that this

is our time we've waited long enough

sometimes she love just doesn't work out

he doesn't like that but he can't do

anything else so it is walnuts turn

I bring the watery sphere to the other

side yeah okay a bunch of fires go out

wonderfully basically doused all the

sides that you can't really get to okay

perfect and that is my whole turn okay

and then don't alright so you like

looking at the end I'm gonna bring this

thing I just yelling over your shoulder

now flash flash flash flash flash flash

well he's after you and I just feel like

going after this guy is just gonna be

not good for me so what can I do to buff

you I run over to you while you're doing

that and I put my hand on your shoulder

and I go I don't this is not a fight I

think we're gonna win we need to really

consider getting out of here and I'll

give you a protection from good and evil

what is that different so well I'm

getting a very you know you are

protected against aberration Celestials

elementals faze fiends and undead

feeling it was going probably one alone

okay creature those types have

disadvantage on the tackles against you

you can't be charmed frightened or

possessed by them if the target is

already turned frightened or possessed

by such a creature I could undo it okay

so okay so you feel this holy aura

surround you which it feels even

stronger and and dinar you feel in the

casting of the spell here it seems to

have even more power

hmm Wow friend I feel the friendship you

do feel the friendship all right go evil

and you're in your own domain you can

sort of through the light mist you can

see the run down the state dilapidated

haunted probably and all these graves

dead leaves all over the ground

what does even know about a domain of

dread so it is a it is custom-made for

its Dark Lord or whoever it reflects

back at them what they are in a way but

corrupts it that is why through the

clouds you cannot see the Sun does she

know

anything about how to escape it

the studying can pass through the mists

of the domains of dread but those that

it is meant to contain cannot so she

thinks that unless someone comes for her

she's there forever yes she falls to her

knees at the grace of her friends and

not knowing whether it will make any

difference or not offers up a prayer to

Lysander but where usually that's a

stream of words and you know recitations

this is just kind of a wordless sob

that's all she does okay you can see the

with your sobbing the clouds above you

begin to sort of thicken and boil become

even more dark and pendulous she stops

sobbing you can sucks it up as you suck

it up you can see that there was

something kind of forming in the clouds

that look like a face and then it kind

of dissolves away you don't think it

would have been a good thing so she

can't cry out again cool so this guy

reappeared again yes so and he's fixated

on woman Paul walks up to him he's not

like attack or anything he just kind of

like shoves him he's just like where is

she I've taken her away take her bags

forever no give me the ring and I'll

bring her back bring her back and you

get the ring No

if you want if you really want that ring

I need to have your word and she needs

to be back here first I want to try and

persuade him go ahead

22 okay

you feel something you see something in

his eyes register you don't quite know

what it is but there's something that

you say relates to him on some level he

can sense something and you hear van

Rycke tan say behind you some ten feet

away

tell him what you feel Paulin hears bam

rechtin he looks straight up he is hell

if something goes you know how it is to

be separated from someone you care about

it's happened to me too many times

bring her back and the Rings yours make

another check with advantage because you

broke the fourth level 23 okay

you didn't see a tear well up in one of

his eyes and he nods and evylyn is

brought back evylyn you suddenly find

yourself in their midst

you co election poll SS out of fog and

there's like I think you know solve your

stains and walnuts still here right oh

yeah give him the ring we'll get it back

somehow but right now this is the only

thing we can do

I know how many times I gotta say this

today I'm not giving him that ring she's

not giving him that ring your promise

wasn't her promise it is

I was paltin stirring he's not taking

his turn Dragonborn guys flying away

like the chicken he is

it is well that's turned I'd say no one

is getting this ring and I turn into my

tree form as a ring just at the

unprotected at the end of a branch is

easily snatch a bunch of a bunch of the

red lectures are standing there with

their smoldering torches looking at the

tree look either torch I'm good to go

um some this beautiful red larch tree

yeah and I am about to do a multi attack

on this scary guy which is to slam

attacks okay you take two swings at him

but they don't connect

well I'm bellow ferociously Ryan what is

dinar do Oh stupid tree friend to give

him the ring or we're all dead or worse

you ever think hey maybe dying is the

easy option do you want to know what

that's like she doesn't listen to me a

lot of the time also mid lecture I make

a move to heal Evelyn cuz it reduced all

the max HP right so yeah and you know

that you would know that

so thanks like no thanks yeah she's

betting she's been drained my horrible a

chronic

like think you know having a great day

you got this yeah

all right big strong paladin I'll take

something I know that I say that to you

worthless like that's all it takes I'll

try to I guess I'll try to swing it the

guy good I'll follow I'll follow the

lead

I'm sure this line perfectly for me um

yeah I got to attack so I'll go at him I

will not go for great weapon master on

this first one so no 16 okay that hits

okay fine six seven eight and then I'll

smite on top of that oh okay

and I will do it I'll burn a level-two

for that smite so 3d8 what I say I

firmly hit for like eight right no first

one fourteen you said I don't remember

hi the second I say something I forget

all right I'll say so that's then ten

thirteen this is not a good one

seventeen twenty okay that is enough to

capone to destroy this corporeal body of

his now and as you hit it it you can see

that he falls down dead on to the ground

no she did you boy over here hey hey

great job team

well done thank you you can see van

Brickton sort of pokes the body with his

stick is his staff and says this is only

the body he was occupying he'll be back
