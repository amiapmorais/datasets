hi everybody and welcome to dice camera

action a D&D show with lots of super

wonderful people one of whom were

missing but only briefly Christina will

be popping in very shortly but while we

are waiting for her grand entrance let

me briefly recap what has happened thus

far the waffle crew encountered an

adventurer named artists Cimber in the

cold cold reaches of the spine of the

world and with him managed to steal the

ring of winter a powerful elvish

artifact from the clutches of a

three-headed frost giant artists warned

the waffle crew about the power of it of

the Ring the evil contained within it

and its ability to take hold of those

who possess it and only by his sheer

force of will had he in the past and the

present been able to wear it safely it

also granted him effective immortality

as the ring halts the aging process of

its wearer the artists and the waffle

crew became separated in the port city

of nigh and the city of Port lions are

on the coast of chalte only to encounter

each other later by chance deep in the

jungles of colt when an airship crash

brought them into conflict and it seemed

as if artists contrary to his earlier

assurances had fallen under this evil

sway of the Ring it was then that the

party slew artists took the ring off him

and it ended up in Paul tins possession

where over a period of time insinuated

itself more and more into Paul tins life

until they essentially emerged and evil

paltin was born all of which were

accidents

yeah palton took the ring into the

shadow fell with the waffle crew and

their new companion Miranda an elvish

druid and it was in the shadow fell that

the ring fell into Miranda's position

whereupon she disappeared from the scene

with the intention of destroying the

ring finding the key to its destruction

and no it wasn't throwing it into a

volcano in this case it was putting it

on the finger

of an archway called the summer queen

but before she could set out unattached

to do at Miranda's perspective changed

when she used the ring to create a

companion of ice named Gwyneth and

became it so again ahthe that she felt

she needed the ring to keep this

friendship this love from melting away

the ring was stolen and borne to the

city of Waterdeep where it returned to

paul Tain's hand once again briefly

before it was seized from him by the

arch wizard mansion he of the iron grasp

mansion slipped Paul Tain's ring on his

finger

evylyn swooped down and tried to tear it

off while everyone else was converging

on Paul tins location not before an ice

dragon was summoned and caused the roof

of the awning portal to collapse last we

left palton he was bleeding out on the

floor evylyn was clutching at mansion's

iron fist to try to get the ring Gwyneth

was swooping down from the sky Miranda

was in the street outside near Strix on

her broom and deaath running like the

wind and that's when a portal outside

opened and Alison DeRay Burton the widow

of artists ember also on a quest for the

ring arrived astride her Tyrannosaurus

Rex I think that pretty much covers it

what a wacky picture to be pink yes so

from from the perspective of people

outside they saw the dragon disappear

into the yawning portal it's a big

building just big enough to fit so

monstrous a creature they saw evil and

disappear inside the building they can

see Gwyneth about to swoop down on the

building and of course they can see the

Tyrannosaurus Rex Strix and deaath

you're actually pretty you sort of cross

paths Strix you would cast the death

wart on D at one point so you're kind of

keeping up with him as he arrives on the

scene

yeah I wanted to have Strix if we're

standing outside of the portal of the

yawning portal right like outside the

door yeah you are you're basically in

the street out in front of the yawning

portal yeah I think we just saw sound

Rochelle yes yeah she literally just

dropped into the street right in front

of Miranda yeah

yeah and well the Strix is like

panicking at this point because the last

time this happened it was terrible and

everyone almost died and unbeknownst to

the waffle crew she's been doing a bunch

of research that has promoted absolutely

nothing just absolutely none she doesn't

understand what's happening but um she's

gonna walk up to death and just kind of

look and be like I don't want you to die

I don't want to die and I don't I think

it's because I'm cursed and she's just

gonna like stand there just going is I

think I'm cursed

and I'd but it's because I don't want

you to die I don't understand its death

we'll just say I don't want you to die

either and I certainly don't want you to

be lost just stay close to me okay well

well this is happening little snowflakes

are rising up into the sky oh god she

doesn't notice that but she's gonna take

her hand and she's gonna put it on his

face and actually put her hand on his

face and say I don't know what this

means but I don't want to lose whatever

this curse is I don't want you to die I

really don't want you to die

after a moment if will can take his hand

and grab hers and we'll just say not

going anywhere

but for now our friends need our help

and like bring the hand down still

holding on to it and turn their

attention back towards the t-rex and a

nice dragon and all that hey guys

misterx is like oh hey Christina

hello can you hear me yeah can you hear

us yes hi happy birthday there are so

many so many characters in this session

and so many moving parts I am using my

own initiative cards today Alice Alice

andhe you come through the portal and

you land in the street in front of this

in the roof of which has collapsed

inward you can hear thrashing from

within but out on the street with you

you see an elf a female elf you see

behind her some distance the familiar

figures of DF and Strix Strix on her

broom floating next to DF and you also

see sort of chaos of just random people

running away from the scene now you know

that you have arrived here basically

targeting this location with the aid of

two of your followers who had been kind

of on the lookout for the ring or signs

of the ring you know they're nearby but

you don't know exactly where they are

those are your bodyguards Assam and

what do you do when you arrive I can I

can see strict Cindy F here yeah they're

they're a little distance away from you

but within if you were to call out to

them they would be close enough to hear

and then you just happen to land near

this elf woman that you don't recognize

who are you why who wait hang on I have

to do something before I talk to you

hang on can you give me just like a

second you don't know who you are I do

well obviously I do know who I am but I

don't know who you are and I don't

really want to talk to you right now

because I have to go save my friends

they're friends of mine as well so oh

friend very cool well I am Miranda then

hi hi I'm gonna go for it okay your

mouth is a little creepy I don't all

right

Terrance is creepy like Lena DFB like

didn't we didn't we make her mad last

time I think she's just always bad okay

that's fine the other thing the other

thing you notice a Lassonde is that it

is very very cold in the city

considering it's near the beginning of

summer that strikes you is not normal

this is clearly a sign that the Rings

Power has been invoked and you also see

that there's snow both falling from the

sky and levitating upward that's normal

I'm gonna make my way over to Strix

India okay which do you want to tell me

what's happening

oh that me is that how you that's how

I'm addressed these days all right only

cuz I forgot your name

it's Strix that's my name God you know I

don't really know if it's my name but

you know it's my name anyway we don't

know what's happening in there and

there's a giant ice dragon and I feel

like your giant dinosaur might be able

to fight that China

dragon sounds like something we could do

yes but we need a plan because last time

I went into a nan like this where the

ring of winter was involved I

immediately almost died and then got

sucked away to help the C team and then

came back healed thankfully with a bunch

of gifts okay I don't know how that

happened

okay that sounds like something do you

have any idea what you'd like to do all

right we need to be strategic I say you

make me Rex

Strix nope that's never gonna happen

strategic is not a thing I know I have

no skills in that department I say that

we take you make the dinosaur go in

first

I look up with a dinosaur and I'm like

Terrance hello would you like to help be

a hero

tell me you're gonna voice my dinosaur

dinosaur sorry

so Terrance is just a t-rex this thing

looks like a dragon she doesn't know he

just lets out this terrible roar but you

know make a insight check strikes okay

that's not for a t-rex cool that's

fourteen okay your best assessment is

that this is this is a trained beast

that is beholden through some sort of

mystical connection - OOP - and is in

the service of a Lassonde and completely

under her control so it will do whatever

you think I'll do whatever she tells it

to do all right okay look at her and I'm

like this is this is a great distraction

for getting whoever has the ring of

winter on to not pay attention to

whoever is taking the ring of winter off

and I like look around deaath and I hold

up my pair of said that scissors are you

intending to cut the finger off we'll do

whatever we have to do it's bad news

over at the window and they turn to look

at you guys and I'm yelling do you guys

know a weird pale man with long hair and

it's great that looks like a beard all

right at this point I'm Miranda as you

are looking through the the window of

the inn you can see the chaos raining

inside this big ice dragon thrashing

around smashing smashing things you see

a man with a sword

looks like he's might be the innkeeper

but it's a big-ass ortiz wielding and a

scary great sword at that and he's

standing toe-to-toe with a black clad

wizard with a metal gauntlet that evylyn

is basically clinging on to and using

her feet to kind of push off from but

there are also a slew of towering green

skinned bat-winged demons that are

descending upon evil in even as you

watch this and they begin to accost her

and the way they move suggests that

there's actually two of these creatures

but that there are multiple magical

duplicates of them to basically thwart

attacks against them so to confuse

anybody who might attack them but right

now their turn they come down and make

big great axe swings at Evelyn Evelyn

the first one is a 22 to hit and the

second one's a natural one so that

missed the 22 will hit okay and then the

second the second swings is a 16 which

misses and a 25 which hits hit so you're

hit a total of twice by two different

attacks and the first one does 27

slashing I am wielding a shield so I'm

gonna use my protection fighting style

as a reaction to impose disadvantage on

that exact okay that second roll is a is

it 26 so it's going to hit two

regardless so 27 on that attack and and

26 on the next for a total of 53 heads

of damage

and then they're done and then their

images all sort of move around to

confuse you as to which one was the

actual one that hit DF what do you do

Strix borrow the scissors I'm sorry you

knew what I was doing who's pointing at

the sisters you grab the scissors yeah

yeah yeah so she hands them over it'll

be easier for me to get in close if it

comes to that that's what I figured

we'll need your magic and your fire to

handle everything else know what I

figured

just please don't die be careful I'm

trusting you

DF we'll go up to the window where

Miranda was kind of peeking in so figure

out what's going on mm-hmm

that's when you see a mansion and evylyn

in close proximity to each other the

dragon which looks like it will wreak

havoc any minute now

palton lying face down on the ground and

I have not met me and shewed before

right that is true because you did not

go to growlin de Villa so what you see

before you is Evelyn duking it out with

a black robed wizard his cowl is up so

you can just see sort of the barest hint

of a very pale face and long dark hair

issuing from underneath it you can also

see that he has a metal gauntlet for his

left hand clenched and the glowing ring

of winter is on one of his fingers looks

real evil just he's just he's got it

he's got a wicked staff yes

metal gauntlet ring and even fighting

I'm is more than enough for me so I know

there's a main entrance to the yawning

portal was there any kind of side or

rear entry point yeah there are other

entry points okay yeah I would like to

make my way to the rear ideally to the

one that's closest to like the backs

of this figure that is battling

absolutely when you go around in that

direction and I just rolled this

randomly you see that the entrance is

open but it's just absolutely choked

with fall and rubble heck we're a large

piece of the ceiling has fallen in Word

and blocked it off that doesn't

necessarily mean you don't think you

could try to slip through it but you see

it's obviously an obstacle okay well I

am a linky boy all right so I will

attempt to try to get to see if I can't

squeeze through that okay you start to

make your way through the wreckage and

the dust make a dexterity acrobatics

check for me this could be really good

that's good 27 okay you are able to

navigate through the wreckage to

basically enter from the side and from

Manchin's perspective behind him great

yeah then depending on how much action I

have left I would like to try to stealth

my way up to him you can absolutely do

that okay go ahead and make a self-check

[Music]

23 wait no I'm proficient therefore

because of my reliable talent 24 okay

all right oh and I forgot the rule for

the demons because they're present as

well okay so neither mansion nor the

night collapse nor the ice dragon are

able to detect you before as you creep

up behind him all right and then I want

to get that ring how are you gonna do

that he's got it worn on the clenched

fist of his metal hand if there's one

thing that Diaz can do its sleight of

hand that's true

which I've done maybe once this entire

campaign who knows how he does it it

seems impossible

from a clenched iron fist

if anyone can do it yes sure can

[Laughter]

well the metal hand kind of scoops me

away from using the scissors sure yeah I

guess this sword yeah it's just kind of

appear behind him and more or less like

grab his hand and pull it out straight

use his right hand to Chi like wrap it

around to hold it straight and then use

that left hand while holding arm

straight to like slip their finger off

from the end that's that's the

theatrical description of the attempt of

sliding the ring pretty sure I said

don't die yeah all right go ahead and

make a strength athletics check to

grapple okay use this die I would like

to use my human determination ability to

give myself an advantage absolutely

because that was a three the three was

better okay remember your death warded

yeah yes so he turns to and looks at you

and set and laughs he laughs in your

space in your face and says I years

searching for this ring now it's mine

once I attuned to it not you not lair

all not elminster of shatter Dale

himself will be able to protect the city

from my wrath and then he tells the

dragon to squish you let uh larold name

drop sure yep

but Gwyneth you're next all right how

far away am i from the hole in the top

of the yawning portal not far at all

like 10 feet away from the hole and

about another 15 or so feet down into

the structure to get to the floor okay

um do I and Miranda is Miranda still

outside or did yeah she she's outside by

a window so that she can see in but she

hasn't actually gone in I'm just gonna

go straight after the Dragons okay go

for it you can you can attack the dragon

and well I'm gonna fly in like after it

okay and as I am uh as I'm flying down

I'm going to create my ice rapier okay

your ice right there just sort of forms

in your hand stretching outward to a

sharp piercing tip yeah and so I guess

yeah I'll go straight for the dragon why

not have at it

make your attacks against the dragon and

remember you have multiple attacks I do

no 16 and 15 okay fortunately this is a

big dragon you hit both times oh good oh

good now just so you know your cold

damage will not hurt the dragon but your

normal piercing damage will that's

that's fair and it's going to take five

and then six points of regular damage

okay

so you think you chip to base of the

chips off its scales the dragon looks

like you can take a lot more of that

poking and do I have any of mice that

25 feet right to get in you correct I'm

just gonna fly up five more feet okay so

you're kind of just hovering above the

dragon that's where you want to be right

yeah okay those of you who are inside

the in Ken for the first time up close

see this woman made of ice with these

beautiful crystalline wings floating

above the Dragon whom she's just pierced

twice with her I see right here except

as like sparkly eye right yes that's

right except for Pauline who's lying

face down on the floor still still dying

here

oh right yep right out on the street

Strix Alessandra and Miranda you see

coming out from some other buildings on

to the street from between two buildings

I should say is a black cloaked figure

with pale face long dark hair and a

metal hand it is it is it is he

it's Manchu yep he has another mansion

he casts a spell and well the first

thing he does is he looks and says to a

Lassonde a Lassonde are a burden

well you have come a long way to die

well no one's died oh and he casts a

spell and a big hand of ice forms before

you a Lassonde and tries to grab hold of

you and I cast halt I'm just going like

this his big bees hand so this will be

I use the hand strength score to attempt

to grapple so this is an ability check

its making against you not an attack so

you get to make a either a strength

athletics or a dexterity acrobatics

check your choice to try to resist this

grappling hand strike 27 okay the hand

tries to grapple you and you just kind

of bend its icy fingers back and throw

the hand off of you it is not able to

grasp you really know me better than

that by now and you can see he just

clenches his fist and shakes it at you

I'm not you know yeah I mean strong

people that aren't wearing armor big

armor then coming up behind you from

some other place in the city a Lassonde

is your druid companion I'll end Rhian

the back of her Triceratops and she says

I am so sorry mistress I got dropped one

Street over I don't know what happened

well you're here now a little late babe

welcome and and she says our arrival

here has created quite a panic now so I

I saw members of the city watch

mustering and heading in our direction

yep and she looks at mention having

watched what he tried to do to you and

she says may I charge him please all

right

she takes the Triceratops and barrels it

toward mansion with the attention of

trying to trample him yeah

he better not hurt her all right

Triceratops rolled a 20 which is enough

all right so it makes this trampling

charge Gore or stomping man soon as a

trundles past knocking man soon to the

cobblestone street and so the wizard is

now prone with the Triceratops basically

looming above him then nine Landry says

stay down

nothing paltin Bolton has a death save

cool cool that's that so that's good

cool

I don't know Chris Perkins what do you

think I mean I can I could decide but I

just assume let the dice do that yep

that would be a five okay so the blood

continues to flow out across the floor

still dead

yes pointing that out still dying I can

see yeah

and Andrew Andrew is going to scuttle

across the floor and launch itself at

this other man June cool the ring of

winter but he just gets swatted away by

mention staff Simon who when we last saw

was basically hiding under a table and

pushed himself over in a corner by the

entrance to stay out of harm's way if

the dragon says to evil in mommy daddy

doesn't look so good he was on the floor

after having like braced her feet

against Minchin trying to pull the ring

off basically like popped off fell on

the ground was attacked by all these

shadowy thinking and she's swatting them

away she's like I know honey it's okay

give mommy just all right

d/f Durnan seems more concerned about

the damage that this dragon is doing to

his establishment and turns to face it

striking it four times or trying to

strike it four times with his great

sword

and he hits the dragon all four times as

the sword oh if the target is an object

it takes extra damage from this sword

great it's not technically an object

though it's a construct but you know

what but you know what it he's

gonna get it who says Chris Perkins is

not the kind so he starts just hacking

away at this ice dragon and big chunks

of the dragon go flying off let's see if

I take average damage okay this dragon

you think after this series of four

whacks may have lost up to one-fifth of

its hit points

all right you see a fifth of its hit

points looks like just when I mean

that's a lot yeah

that also means there's four-fifths

remaining okay oops I just took that off

the wrong creature look just leave it

you know you can leave and yeah I had

that long mansion it's like well no

imagine No so after whacking on this

dragon four times he says to the dragon

grave mistake out on the street Strix a

Lassonde you see two figures come out

from around the backside of the tavern

at first they look like tall well-built

chaltén men in sort of cloaks and plain

garb but then they rip their cloaks off

with this flourish the cloaks magically

turned to shadow all around them swirl

around them once and then the cloaks

disappear and what's left standing where

they were are the same two men but they

are clad in golden armor with

pterodactyl Helms do you recognize them

Alessandra as your bodyguards a saw

and Faris freaking cool

there two pterodactyls just fly right

over them like fighter jets cool and

they pull out their great swords and

charge the mansion lying prone on the

street stretch' has wanted this like the

coolest thing she's ever seen like oh

wow

alright I thought you were done with

dinos yeah they both hit man soon and

the wizard on the street looks in pretty

bad shape that's them all right the

mansion in the tavern goes next you can

see that the ring is sort of sparkling

on his hand but it doesn't sort of

shimmer evil in the way you saw it when

it was in Paul Kings possession like it

hasn't he hasn't fully awakened its

power yet for that reason he does not

use the ring at this point in time

except but he does shoot his gaze up at

the curious flying creature who's been

attacking his ice dragon and he says to

you Gweneth all that the ring has made I

control and he holds his mailed hand up

to you

you see the glimmer of the ring and he

is trying to exert control over you but

since you were not simply created by the

ring but be created by the ring and

Miranda's power you get a saving throw

to resist mansion's command which which

saving through that would be a wisdom

saving through I'm sorry highest I'm

sorry that's a lie that would be a

charisma saving throw well I roll the

natural 20 so I don't think it really

matters that much okay don't touch my

girlfriend yes and Miranda you're

looking through the window Italy Duke

basically while he's trying to exert the

power of the Ring over her and when it's

like no coming after it

all right that's his

the ice dragon goes next DF and Durnan

are the subjects of its wrath good all

right so first thing off it tries to

bite Durnan successfully that hurt then

it tries to claw Durnan twice succeeding

both times Durnan is bloodied after that

and then tail smash on you paltin that

will be a 19 I'm sorry I'm sorry idea 19

yeah I remember you have the best I do

and I also have is pulling out gutter

and using my new blade mastery feat to

use my reaction to enter a parry stance

didn't mean one more additional armor

class oh oh he misses okay that's

the ice dragon okay I also have

advantage on an opportunity to attacks

but don't matter it's good to know yeah

inside the tavern coming out of the

shadows is a stealthy assassin like

figure I heard the kids like battle

royale all right yes when you your hair

is on the back of your neck tingled when

you you realize that there is another

person here a dangerous force about to

reveal itself it does not attack you

however it grabs Simon from underneath

the table fix him up and holds a blade

to the hit and you realize it is earth

stole flaxen

sent assassin who you have met time and

again and he says touch the wizard and

dies out on the street more figures show

up and it's not it is not the city watch

Todd

it is a a woman who looks like a

swashbuckler in black leather with a

rapier and red red curly hair there is a

a male sarami

colorfully dressed looks like a bard and

has a a liar ly r II in his possession

and there is a host of flying snakes

very colorful flying snakes all around

him there is a bald woman whose head is

covered with tattoos dressed in black

robes there is to halflings both females

dressed like ninjas there is a there is

a callous shite woman with a curved

scimitar dressed in gleaming armor

there is a halfling who looks like a a

very well dressed wizard with a dashing

looking cape and a sort of a tricorn hat

and there is a male half work with a red

mohawk all of these interim figures pour

out into the street and the the

swashbuckler woman orders them to she

shouts kill the dinosaurs right the Oni

portal is the Tilted towers of water

yeah yeah we're like crisps that rolled

one d100 yeah that's probably gonna show

up let's go the ones on the ground began

running over and attacking the

Triceratops and charging a Lassonde

across the the street to get at her to

take her down offer t-rex meanwhile from

the rooftops come a flurry of crossbow

bolts that rained down upon both

dinosaurs everyone's here let's play

let's play game everyone drinks every

time chris says meanwhile from now on

all right so both Terence and the

Triceratops while big hulking brutes

they're not that hard to hit so a

Lassonde several crossbow bolts start to

stick in Terence aside neck and head and

you can see that the halfling ninjas are

basically dancing around your try your

t-rex's feet and thrusting and stabbing

at it with their knives it's the inside

of ludicrous to you that these tiny

little creatures are attacking this big

creature but you do admire their

ferocity their fearlessness while that's

going on Strix in me what do you do I'm

overwhelmed I'm just like looking from

the pterodactyls to van soon too like

this I was like but I knew that I know

that paulson and evil and andy ever in

the end so I'm just like okay staying on

your broom like going in through the

roof kind of deal here through the

entrance or what um I will probably go

through the entrance

cuz I'm right in front of the entrance

alright because I don't think I want to

go in the air considering there's a

dragon and crossbow bolts and there's a

thousand things going on right now

alright

while that's going on the the you sort

of one of the people you blow past is

this isn't Arum this colorfully dressed

centaur and bar to us all these flying

snakes over his head he's not paying

attention to you but he's striking

he's striking notes on his lyre to

inspire the santarem and to warn them

that the city watch could arrive at

anytime so Strix you can get into the in

and still have that action okay so I

passed by I passed by this guy who's

inspiring everyone yep okay yeah you're

know okay um well if I see him inspiring

everyone I don't want that to happen so

I'm just gonna look at him and just kind

of be like you know how many people in

that area can say can i if he's outside

the door could maybe Shane lightning

reach someone inside no could you think

it could reach but you don't necessarily

have line of sight if you're outside oh

I see I think your jobs you're gonna

wait until you get into the place and

then sort of chain like yeah okay yeah

you could do that that's what I'm gonna

do yeah okay so one when I get inside

I'm going to look around in an assess

who is the biggest threats there's a

big-ass ice dragon probably that's it

biggest threat then there is the mansion

wizard inside battling DF and evylyn and

there are two big demon creatures who

make a Arcana check to see if you

recognize what they are I'm just I just

 myself right now

that's a ten yeah you don't know what

they are but there's multiple copies of

them they look familiar but I can't

remember which plane of the hell's I saw

them in right and given what you know

about the May or sorry the mirror-image

spell I'm just checking to see what

targeting might do to that it only

effects attacks it looks like ok so if I

were so if I were to cast something on

these demons if they're if I'm if I am

assuming that it's a mirror image if I

can kind of tell then I know that a

Chain Lightning would also get rid of

that mirror image yes if you if you want

to it's interesting

each time a creature targets you with an

attack time spell yeah so the duplicates

only matter if if the creature is

actually

being attacked but if it's making a

saving throw versus a spell the marriage

image images don't matter okay so your

spell just sort of avoids them all right

well I'm just gonna go in and focus on I

don't know if I really want to mess with

that ice dragon but I guess the ice

dragon is probably the biggest threat so

I'm gonna go ahead and cast Chain

Lightning on that ice dragon okay it's

also going to go towards the person

who's inspiring the scents yep and if I

can see the guy who has Simon it's gonna

go for him too

okay make a perception check to see if

you've noticed him he's not hiding per

se nope all right okay but first things

first

mansion is gonna attempt to counter

spell your spells okay fine

that's fine okay your spell goes fizzle

fizzle pop nothing happens cool okay um

well then I'm going to do use my sorcery

points and when that happens and just

look at him and say you were a chicken

and I'm going to use my quicken spell to

try and polymorph him again okay the

second man to note in the street will

attempt to counter spell that he doesn't

see me yes he does

cool okay it doesn't not work well what

doesn't the counter spell triggers that

the polymorph spell is counter spared no

oh there goes all my spells so you think

you think that's exactly what mansion

was waiting for cool cool cool

alright as I realize that I just start

to cry okay just start to cry yeah cry

with like tears I like all of my friends

are going to die I've let them down and

I hate myself kind of cry Doppel DF we

almost forgot about him but here is on a

car to really can't forget yeah so da

PDF what would you what would you like

to do you've got evylyn

you've got other DF o other DF God you

hate him Oh what I can't believe a fake

deaath would arrive here in front of me

I real DF I will show him watch more I

hadn't I'm gonna stop oh dear - actual

death

alright so double D F makes his first

attack at +6 in a second attack of +6

alright and he he tries to be all like

cool ninja aha

yes that's more like a real derp like

high knee high elbow and this comes out

on DF it still does Perry stance yeah

that's true no room for fakes year real

Deus to flex the first one okay great

second attack killed to say I'm much

better-looking than this fake DF Oh and

rolls worse okay both miss structure a

momentarily confused when you see one DF

attacking another and the one who's

doing the attacking seems particularly

clumsy oh I'm like no not again I just

like pointing it I'm like that's the

stranger face touch evylyn you're up

okay so halten is within 30 feet of me

correct yes right and also this person

holding my son hostage is also within 30

people yes good thing mommy

Evelyn is good at multitasking so she

just she looks at this and she with

great frustration and power goes oh and

like superhero punches the ground and an

aura of vitality Springs out from her

womb which then maintains an aura of

sparkling gold healing around her in a

thirty feet radius

I believe let me double-check that

thirty feet radius yeah so that's a lot

and that will heal paltin 2d6 hitpoints

remotely and then that's the bonus

action is casting so the casting spell

is the action dang it I thought I could

get away with casting and moving hmm LS

your you can you can still you've only

used a bonus action at this point right

well casting the spell would be the

action and then the bonus action is the

healing but then you still have movement

yeah so but I can't like I was gonna try

to move into my son I see can I move no

hands just like not trying to attack

anyone just they happen to get in my way

and I move real fast can I just try to

topple them over like no those aren't

the try Kristen you can get it you can

get in their face that's about it and if

they move away from you and do nothing

but move and attempt to do something

else you can take an opposite AK if the

circumstances allowing yeah I'll just

get right up in his face okay we like as

soon as I have another action Sonny you

can see Simon is protesting this whole

time saying oh I wish I had some darts

and so much is looking anyway Miranda

Miranda you're outside the window what

do you do

can I see palton from here yes he's

lying on the photo did you roll the hit

points for Appleton's

healing oh yeah well that's going on

Miranda you can see that healing light

seems to wash over palton so you don't

think he's in any imminent danger of

like just bleeding out mm-hmm

can I see oh my god man soon with the

written I rolled snake eyes on those two

DS

cool okay it's fine it's okay fine

Paulding light wakes up with just a can

I see the mansion with the ring inside

the end from where I am

you sure can cool all right she has this

neat thing called balm of the summer

court we're gonna dump 5d6 of healing

into paltin I remember that one yeah

you've got 14 health but I am also going

to go ahead and test some insect plague

on man shoots face the constant good

news is thanks to Strix he has already

used his reactions yay thanks I'm a

great guinea pig wasting my six levels

okay so it is a 20-foot radius sphere so

it will also get it'll it'll have the

dragon in its range it'll have DF in its

range and it will have palton in its

range can I maneuver it so it's just on

the back of mansion you can move that's

interesting so DF is kind of on one side

of mansion and paltin on the other so

pick your Oh

is there anyone above him anymore or is

evil in his has moved she she went off

to confront somebody else who you can't

see so can I pick a point above his head

so that his head isn't in the bottom of

the 21st fear not without getting well

hmm reminder mm-hmm not doing great

cool yeah okay

do you have anything that lets you like

shape your spells or anything like that

or um not my spells I have no not really

cuz mansion and deaths like head Heights

are pretty much the same I guess you

know palms on the ground but you're

trying to be very precise with the spell

that's just not yeah his bugs just bugs

[Music]

might just use that fifth level spell

sled anyway and you call lightning okay

in fatal just hit him I don't it will

just hit him okay he's gonna make a deck

save yes he does

okay well that's his metal hand conduct

the electricity and make it worse so

that normally so does wearing armor

impose disadvantage normally like this

is like shocking okay so he wrote a the

only role 213 so I'm betting that's

probable and no bad for him yeah okay

then go ahead and roll your dommage he

takes all of it money lightning damage

okay yeah all right am i able to mask of

the wild and try and disappear a little

bit oh I suppose realize he has

advantage on his saving throws oh what's

your what's your DC 16 okay he still

didn't make it

oh yeah you can you can do that

absolutely yes alright I'm gonna hide it

right in front of the window kind of use

my cloak to camouflage and just sit

there with my eyes peeking up in the

window watching everything okay

meanwhile there's all this battle

playing out on the street behind you

Miranda

so we trying to hide from that yep the

Bard

who

is inspiring the cents basically six all

of his flying snakes on Donna

Oh all asunder I was waiting for him

yeah

so a swarm of flying snakes flies toward

you a Lassonde and begins trying to bite

you there are a total of ten okay

I know they have to I basically roll in

natural 20 to hit you so they swarm

around you and none of them is able to

get through your armor and I at that

moment at that moment just say drop

you're just gonna tell the snakes to

drop I am and then the target will drop

not draw I want them to grovel because

I'd like them prone on the ground does

it a fat how many targets does it affect

well at higher levels anything above

your class so up to about Oh level 20 mm

yes I think I could hit all 10 of them

okay

and they do they have to understand you

I mean do they need a language to do or

is it just doesn't matter

um yes they need to understand but I

also speak let's he's not Parseltongue

[Laughter]

I'm quite fluent and parcel you know

what us common reads right speaks and

understands don't they they actually do

understand what you're saying so they

drop all these snakes flying snakes to

sort of fall to the ground and just

start pressing themselves as close to

the ground as possible all around you

that ends their turn yes it does the

city watch shows up

they start to come into the streets a

Lassonde they the ones closest to you

are so taken aback by the presence of

your mount and you that they seem

hesitant to attack and rightfully so

honestly they don't seem all that

interested in you in terms of setting up

staging some sort of conflict against

you they begin to target and pinpoint

members of the Sontaran if somebody was

outside who would recognize him I would

let you know Todd could just be just you

know third third guard from the left to

alice andhe and Miranda yeah no frame of

reference no history checked oh nothing

nothing to roll Todd is still third

guard to the left for most of us indeed

all right a very very large arrow comes

sailing into the battle a Lassonde you

see it and Miranda you notice it when

the bard stops playing briefly his lyre

and this big gigantic arrow shoots

through his body and sticks there and

you're not even sure what came from he

just sort of spins around kind of looks

in your direction and realizes he's got

this gigantic bolt through his body

sorry buddy he's still alive and just

kind of shocked and obviously bleeding

profusely and not in great shape and

then a second bolt comes at him and goes

right through his head and he falls dead

to the ground still shocked yes

Miranda the santarem woman with the

shaved head and the tattoos takes notice

of you even with my mask of the wild

that's a good question I forgot

but that no she doesn't

okay she turns toward a Lassonde and

looks like she's prepared to cast a

spell and then invisible Red Devils each

about the size of a cat appear around

her and start stinging her with their

scorpion tails am i aware of what's

happening

yeah alisande you see this threat about

to cast a spell on you when suddenly

she's beset by imps these these dental

creatures and it is your turn

Alessandra it is it is so much chaos

around you

my Landry is busy fighting some of these

interim people the city watches

Fighting's and Terran people and your

bodyguards have arrived and are awaiting

orders what do you do I would like to

send my bodyguards inside to try to

disarm man Shanna three okay that's what

they do what do you do all right I want

to go inside I feel like my my people

have this under control

so I would like to go inside are you

dismounting yes I will dismount

okay Terrence seems to be cute keeping

them okay so yes you're able to

basically stride in behind your

bodyguards they will move to the sides

so that you are granted the entrance

that you deserve like a queen entrance

and they part the way yes love this all

right

and for the first time evylyn and paltin

you see that hala Sanda has appeared I

do because he is injured but looking

better than he did a few seconds ago a

long time no see there

we we that look lot

oh I knew that I knew that no I'm just

would you come here for a moment do you

have the strength to come here for a

moment

looks like the strength is still slowly

returning to his battered body but just

gonna sit in like and I think I'm gonna

stay here you have enough movement to a

Lassonde that you could get over to him

alright at that point I would like to

walk over to him and lean really close

to his face and boop him on the nose and

use lay on hands to heal him okay how

much healing would you like to give him

how much does he need I can go up to

about a hundred you feel like it's

somewhere in the realm of like 72 max

alright so I will boop him on the nose

and restore 70 how do you just Boop me

20 not the way that I did or would you

like to be grateful and just say thank

you and help your friends thank you that

was what full that was the most helpful

thing anyone's done you know like yeah

2hp

very valid very much and he liked evil

and thank you for letting me not die

that was really cool I like not dying I

appreciate you I want you to know that

you know what would be great is if with

that healing came humility not wrong I

mean what what came what now I'm sure

it's a word that's not in your

vocabulary but you're welcome thank you

I just like throw up it's like Oh still

processing almost dying body's really

still not used to that you

after like the third almost time nope

hurts every time

speaking of processing many situations

happening yeah demon creatures fall on

top or come down with their axes on top

of a Lassonde and her bodyguards just

sort of appear around her to block and

try to take the blows and they are

successful in parrying both of the

demons attacks nice yeah yeah I'm still

being accosted by fake death yes and you

were still very close to this mansion

yeah and you see that mentions assassin

as Simon yeah I hate that guy it says if

you do anything to the wizard Simon gets

it alright so in the middle of parrying

against fake Deus really pathetic blows

like he never does not know how to use a

sword at all

yes left hand he grabs hold of moon

splinter and on she's that in the middle

of harrying misty steps away appear

behind flotsam okay so I could stab them

in the back of the throat well done go

for it you really yeah that's a lot 27

yep that gets him okay I've gotten to

roll a lot of these things in a while

there you go her still still has some of

the scars from his previous altercations

with you but yep bring it back to finish

it up

Oh oh yeah okay a few sixes in here so

that feels good 41 okay he is still

alive after that attack cool isn't

enough to least like loosen his grip on

Simon or anything no cool Wow got them

okay do you have any other attacks or

anything we want to do that's I only had

like the one attack okay that's I got

alright so I have a question is what

mansion using the ring on me is that uh

that wouldn't be like charmed or

anything would it I guess it would be

something like that

but it's it's more like it's the ring

since you're basically a piece or a

fragment that the ring is created it's

it's basically but yeah well say it's

like a charm effect because I I'm immune

to being charmed okay that wouldn't

apply to this desk anyway so I'm gonna

throw some ice starts at him okay but

since you've broken the hold of the Ring

you can't be affected by it you're

you've oh you're fine

I'm still gonna throw some ice table

salutely yet to throw three I have one

dirty twenty I have a 17 and an 18 okay

the dirty 20 hits the 17 and the 18 do

not they are knocked away by his staff

and they just sort of shatter as he hit

all right well he's going to take 8

points of 6 points of regular damage and

2 points of cold damage okay that he was

taken off the wrong person that he does

and that blood ease mention at that

moment versatile oxen

so terrified he runs away as a change of

heart all about Redemption stories right

yeah having just taken 41 points of

backstabby damage yeah

and seeing a mansion in a bloodied state

does not do anything to Simon other than

continue to hold him he seems to panic

and contemplate his options the mansion

outside on the street let's see

everybody is basically inside except for

Miranda who is hidden from the yes all

right

this mansion outside basically casts a

spell on the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the

Tyrannosaurus Rex is engulfed in a

hemispherical energy field and pulled

down into the ground just gone this life

literally is like a Marvel movie like

there'd be so much CG in the seen people

just disappearing into clouds of dust

yeah he's my child you monster and then

Nylund Ray takes her Triceratops and

stomps on top of man soon basically

dances on his head smashing him into the

ground to a pulp and Miranda you see

that man soon turn into slush oh okay

are we talking like ice slasher like

blood okay I was picturing something a

lot worse yeah my mind went dark places

Miranda you see more of these large

bolts flying through the air and

piercings and flesh you see that the two

ninjas standing around

and where the Tyrannosaurus used to be

now start to accost some City Washington

paltin what do you do okay

do I see mansion with the ring you sure

do

okay it's like Simon's also still held

hostage that is not good

yep I'll turn the Manchu in just be like

listen here buddy

it's not yours you'd best act

accordingly and I'm going to attempt to

use one of my fists ani cursors on okay

which is wisdom seventeen he has

advantage why okay

Paulsen just says why he rolled a 2 and

a 1 on the die so Mansion is now until

the spell is removed on a tune to the

ring of winter okay alright then the

ring just sort of goes kind of dead and

dark on his gun lit hand and he doesn't

understand you can tell just by the way

he looks at the ring he doesn't

understand what's just happened this is

this is something something's gone

horribly horribly awry you know ah

you're mine damn you I mean it's still

pretty all right is that it for Putin as

a bonus action I will turn to scary lady

who just said very intimidating whereas

I'm just like I just want to just you

know play you a nice little tune as my

appreciation

I'm gonna give some Bartok inspiration

okay he's don't be mad at me all right

so what will that actually amount to

then C 1 D 10 to 1 ability check attack

role or saving throw that's for a

Lassonde all right hand Roux will use

its action to give mention the finger

[Laughter]

hell yeah Simon will tell his captor now

it'd be a good time to run away Durnan

will attack the dragon four times he

will hit the dragon four times average

damage same as last time

okay the dragon is now about a little

over a little around half lost half its

hit points and large chunks of it are

smashed away he doesn't really have to

there's enough going on that Ursula is

contemplating all of his life choices

but her still has not done anything to

Simon as yet Alice on does bodyguards

will attack the demons they'll each

attack the demons three times okay those

are potential hits but they're going to

hit so Alice on d'you see your guards

swishing their glaives around and just

going through the mirror images and

images of these false images of these

demons are popping all around them until

only the two demons remain man soon with

the ring hmm bad night renovations to

mansions turn

he is going to point a finger at paltin

and no finger of death what what he will

point to a metal finger at your head

and cast finger of death counterspell

can I counter spell that please sure

since finger of death is a seventh level

spell you need to make a check how high

oh do I have to have to be if it's

seventh level it the DC and this is so

making ability check using your spell

casting ability which is charisma okay

so it's a charisma check against the DC

of 17 okay

could I attempt to do the same there's

nothing stopping either of you from

doing this but you might just want to

wait till Strix tries okay I'm trying to

save my friends I already messed up real

bad

[Laughter]

palton okay ah I rolled a one okay so

you do your your counter spell doesn't

work Paul tells since you have not used

a reaction yet so what am i wrong you

are

it is a charisma check okay DC 17 so

it's just add your charisma bonus it is

is that a safe thing no it's just a

straight ability check so he points his

metal finger at me I am and I just point

back like no 12 5 so 17 all right I I

think I get there's some sort of

disadvantage to spells or like

protection from spells that my Torah

gives I'm frantically trying to look it

up okay there's counter spell yeah you

don't have to worry about that because

palton just counters spelled the effect

like how many times have I just like

ruined restrict suck she's she's done

the ice dragon mansion has the ice

dragon it's going to provoke an attack

of opportunity from deaaath as he

commands it to destroy paltin actually

no he's going to command it to breathe

so I will need paltin evylyn DF Simon

Miranda and Durnan to make a

constitution saving throw wait what's

that

am I not close enough you are not in it

scone I'm in the doorway al-asad isn't

that the wall actually isn't gonna help

you cuz it's gonna basically blast

through the wall but I will I will give

you advantage Miranda because you have a

cover is okay okay okay is this the

dragon this is the dragon doing this one

gets plus 5

why is it wait why is the dragon who

commanded the dragon

oh you saw a tuned would the dragon even

listen oh that's a good question because

you've assent well mention hadn't fully

a - all you have to do is wear the ring

to control the creature but actually

since you used your ability paulten I'm

going to see if the dragon just ignores

mansion which it does oh thank god

dead Simon yeah so you see yeah the

dragon just kind of gives mansion kind

of a dumb look dumb I see you you don't

listen to that bad man as the dragon is

is considering you know decides not to

do anything on this turn earth still

seeing that mansion has gone limp with

power drops Simon and uses all his

action to disengage

and you see are still leap away from UDF

spring through the wreckage into the

back of the awning portal leaping over

the bar into the kitchen to escape

that's mine

hope when the parents catch up to him

more chaos outside yadda yadda yadda

blah blah blah Strix uh-huh

what would you like to do most useless

party member would just like to continue

to cry okay

well there's still a nice there's still

a nice dragon and there's still an arch

wizard with a staff of pine and I still

I I kind of look at the staff and I'm

like there are two demons okay he's got

that there's a demons there's that I'm

taking it into into consideration I'll

take it yeah

an effect yeah do you want an easy kill

[Laughter]

is the and like like pretty up

yes at this point yes and there's a you

know that one of the features of the end

is this big pit the circular pit in the

middle of it o is anyone by the pit

yeah the dragons by the pit mansions by

the pit oh no that's too stupid hold on

one second um and everyone's been hurt

okay okay you know what I don't I don't

want to do my chickens cuz I feel like

that's gonna take too long so I'm just

going and he's already counter spelled

so many times like I know how many times

this guy guy counter spell me um depends

on how many slots he is Oh what probably

yeah

um so I'm you won't whatever it I'm

gonna turn my staff into a frying pan

and cast green flame blade on it okay

and I'm going to run up to man shoot and

hit him in the face okay go ahead and

that's what I do I just turn it over

that's what I do okay you have to make

an attack role I do have to make an

attack role okay

okay I'm gonna use my weird divine

 to add something to this so

that's that's his actual name by the way

in divine thank you that's my

my you know my whatever and that's 15

so that's including your divine

yes okay he is able to block you wishes

staff so your your frying pan gets a big

loud clanging sound as it hits his metal

staff okay well now that I've distract

him him you are in his grill I'm gonna

do quick and spell okay and I'm really

close to him so I'm gonna do and do face

to face he was I just was bad because I

kept doing bad and now I'm in trouble

you're no wizard I'm just like no I'm

not a wizard I'm a sorcerer okay that's

fine and I'm gonna do quick and spell a

sacred flame on him okay and eleventh

level is 3d8 and it's a 60 feet actually

so anything within 60 feet of this oh no

that's great that's a range yes okay so

yeah it's just down on one yeah yeah so

sacred flame so it's gonna do 3d eight

actually you have to make an attack role

or is it a saving throw it is

instantaneous a saved acts 17 oh you did

that you call it like down yes and is it

like your green fire just yes it's like

yeah and it does radiant damage actually

which you would notice yes yeah okay

yeah so you this this green flame comes

streaking down he has advantage on his

saving throw sir it's dexterity you said

dexterity okay that's that's kind of

what he sucks the most that so he rolled

a total of 12

on his best save so you're gonna hit him

all right so that's 14 damage okay all

right

he he withers a slightly under that and

you sort of burn a hole through his robe

as it hits him right in the top of the

head and it looks cool and I'm like I'm

a sorcerer I'd might suck but at least I

can do this distraction distraction pan

Doppel DF you don't like the Strix is

attacking your master fear not ah master

Strix dad you shouldn't do that

I show you what you should not do listen

to the app source like turns around

alright I guess just take two attacks

yeah plus six on each attack on Strix

what are the pluses on them again sorry

plus six Oh fifteen and seventeen oh

yeah they both hit okay sorry

alright so it's a c6 plus 4 on each

attack Oh bad no I haven't lost any hit

points I'm fine

these are really weak attacks boink

boink triple maybe I mean they're both

max damage 20 total okay I'm just like

oh alright that's double the earth

evylyn Simon is no longer imperiled as

the assassin who had him has fled was

Simon damaged at all

nope good boy

so in my near vicinity is a Lassonde

alton the ice dragon the ice dragon two

demons double DF mentioned Strix and

Alessandra's two bodyguards and Gwyneth

thank and on the edge of the pit is just

the ice dragon or man tuned as well

they're both within

pretty close to the edge of the pit and

so right now is Strix and toppled the

earth there they're all in that general

edge of the pit area and Halton is fully

healed districts look worse for wear she

just took her first damage I look fine

I'm just like oh all right then

even we'll look around with her aura of

vitality still up and she'll be like I

should go and take it in for herself

okay she will gain four okay and then

she will just she's like I've had just

about enough of you and she's just gonna

go ignite the heart of Spinelli and go

for a man tune okay we both got flaming

weapons it's so cool yeah yeah you just

did radiant damage we're like we're

rocking it so her first attack is CP and

it is 16 that is blocked blue her second

attack is a not 20 oh well then crit

crit away yay

and she also feels like adding some

divine smite to that my bad

I bet she's feeling pretty pretty good

about just telling the good word of

Lysander to this evil wizard so the

natural damage is gonna be 6 8 is 14

plus 4 is 18 and then it's double the

dice right that's right so we don't

create enough to remember what a crit

actually it is a rare thing for you guys

3434 natural with the sword without the

divine smite and then the divine smite

is gonna be oops oops

why there we go okay 34 plus 38

I'm so sick it's really hard to do math

oh no you're sick

oh yeah super sick no and then oh man

forty-six last year rolls were ones that

sucks all right so you just start

battering away on him and the wizard

just sort of gets knocked back by that

mighty crit and kind of withers under

your under your blow but is still on his

feet

Miranda what would you like to do can

you describe the area around and behind

mansion for me yes so the there in the

main tap room of the in which is just

absolutely littered with debris from the

collapsed ceiling crushed tables

splintered beams things like that but

the dominant feature in the middle is a

large like over 20 feet across circular

shaft that plunges into the earth it

looks quite old and mansion is standing

at the edge of it with Strix and evylyn

in a pitched battle him using his staff

to basically try his best to parry the

blows of the frying pan and this flaming

sword

let me behind him it's it's claws

basically clenched into the sides of the

pit in the surrounding floor is the

great ice dragon which is truly

monumental and your friend your dear

friend Gwyneth fluttering above it can I

see a point behind him is it visible to

me yeah do I get the sense that if I

used hidden pathways I would lose my

call lightning mm-hmm

hidden pathways is not a spell right no

then you're fine

okay I'm gonna hidden pathways right

behind him okay Miranda suddenly appears

not too far from Strix and evylyn

call lightning down again on top of them

boom all right and he's gonna make

another dexterity say any throw correct

yes

okay this time he's he's gonna do it

because he ruled I think 20 total okay

then he's gonna take ten lightning okay

that he does sort ice do I see Miranda

for the first time or no I saw her

before

I'm like hey I'll make the flowers in a

second but I got we got just you know a

Lassonde hmm what's happening around me

at the moment so they've got that

situation under control

they've all got mansion surrounded these

three women and then there's this big

giant ice dragon that's threatening you

not so much threatening you right now

because it's sort of stupidly watching

waiting to see who's going to control

the ring next the demons are by far the

greatest threat I use that word in

quotes because you're bodyguards are

basically keeping them away from you to

the extent that you want to I mean

they'll move aside and let you crush

their demonic skulls should you so wish

with your bare hands if you so wish Oh

question mm-hmm

can I throw two javelins at one time

yeah so I'd like to take my two

adamantine javelins mm-hm and aim them

at the heads of the demons okay go ahead

and make an attack role against each

demon okay the first was a nineteen

second one two eighteen and both of

those are plus twelve well then what do

you thinks gonna happen crit okay go

ahead and roll your damage as you pierce

the skulls of these creatures eighty six

plus six

so twelve and eight okay when they are

struck by your javelins the javelins

literally just stick right in their

heads and they start screaming and

trying to pull these javelins out of

their skulls they're both still standing

but the unholy sound coming out of their

throats right now fills you with a sense

of pleasure well considering I get an

extra attack can I use it

mm-hmm fun all right and then I would

like to are they within 30 feet oh yes

I'd like to use destructive wave and

they must pass a constitution saving

throw or take 5d6 Thunder damage Oh

destructive weightless ripple good okay

and half damage if they fail mm-hmm okay

one of them succeeds in one of them

fails a destructive wave courses through

this place Vernon might have words but

18 to the first okay

13 damage to the second okay their bezel

and with half damage yeah they are both

looking really hurt

next up is them they are going to try to

accost you but your guards intercede

again and make themselves the targets

instead so the demons do some damage to

each of your guards but your guards look

like they can weather it and of course

they're honored to take the damage in

your stead d/f the dragon seems to be

sort of struck stupid at the moment it's

not taking any obviously aggressive

action the greatest threats appear to be

mentioned who's got Strix Evelyn and

Miranda surrounding him and the demons

who malice andhe and her bodyguards have

checked hmm okay in earth still is just

out he's bailed yeah all right well

seeing as that Strix had just engaged

him in melee combat right in his face

yep this is the best opportunity for me

to get behind them and try to mmm

no I know I'm gonna do okay I'm gonna go

up behind Thomas toppled Deus is

attacking strict est oh yeah okay go

ahead you have to have an AC 1400 not 14

yeah I say that I don't want to

embarrass myself really badly here

double D F is also quite wounded all

right sixteen sorry - get him okay yes

go ahead just say uh sneak attacking are

all very much what do you think he is

engaged in melee so you get your sneak

attack okay I'm still good alright I'm

just gonna do this

he's dead okay

i D F D

eviscerates double DF who is no more

there's a lot to look at forty-something

okay he does not have that kind of he's

got eight hit points left okay yeah it's

like it's like a backstab and then like

as he like loses consciousness and

reverts back to normal like doppelganger

for idea to like pull a sword out and

then like the Kapiti him and like shove

is headless by you to the ground nice

and blood like sprays all over everyone

in the proximity there's there's like an

extra rage in anger behind it going if

you see Miranda now dealing or in combat

with Evelyn and Strix against this

wizard mansion the dragon seems to be

kind of at a rest state at the moment

and there are two demons who seem to be

truly occupied by some folks is Miranda

she's about 15 feet away from you tops

I'm gonna fly over when I land next to

her and I say excellent lightning my

love and that I'm going to attack and

soon with my ice rapier getting twice

your face oh maybe just once we'll see

what the second role is okay

that was a 13 he's able to parry that

with his staff and another natural 20 oh

no okay you're the whole my love and my

girlfriend stuff she's like she's

looking at Miranda like and then she

hears that and you see her face freeze

in this happy face and she's like I have

a question guys true when you do crit

crit damage do you do two roles or do

you one role and then double it all the

roll all the dice roll twice so roll

roll your weapon die damage again and

and also your cold damage again it

doubles my cold damage doc yeah anytime

you roll a die roll an extra

I okay okay

I'm too excited I can't see man okay so

that will be why can't I do math right

now and 12 okay for a regular damage

plus and then plus five cold damage okay

that your ice rapier goes through

mentions chest and comes out the other

side so that Miranda you can see the tip

of her ice rapier sticking through the

opponent and man soon collapses dead I'm

gonna take that ring so you can pick up

you can pick up an object as part of

your action so yeah you can pull the

ring off his dead mailed hand can I put

it on my hand you can pick it up that's

all you can do is but you've got it okay

yeah so actually it's not your turn yet

right hang on I'm getting ahead of

myself

we're still in initiative roll

initiative yeah so who knows who will

get the ring stay tuned don't need to

worry about her Donnie rivet her

actually it's Paulson's turn next oh

cool convenient paulten mansion is lying

dead at the edge of the pit the ring on

his metal hand now waiting to be taken

once again baby I'm on my way the ring

finger okay as soon as you hold it it

reactivates and it Tunes to you and your

eyes go brilliant very even also shots

Weis tricks and even in unison to go

right

alright how do we how do we destroy this

thing oh I know I've got it that's why

it was gone I found out I did I really

actually did um we need to go to the

court of the summer Fang Queen and put

it on her finger but before we do that I

need to ask her a favor so okay the ring

really does not want that to happen

paltin you know a part of me doesn't

want it to happen but at this point man

we've done this song and dance so much

and we should really just accept that

this just this won't work

you are incompatible what know that

we're compatible relationship Bolton we

have had this conversation before

Ollis andhe that is your husband's ring

oh I know and I'd like it back please

Oh always who is this woman

well the last time that I saw them I

spared their lives so I think that we

should come to an agreement

I am Alessandra ray Burton wife of our

December that ring belonged to my

husband and it has also been promised to

someone else

to make good on the army that I used to

storm your entire village destroy your

home but what I'd suggest that you do is

hand over the ring and let me return it

to its rightful place and the waffle

crew would know she's referring to the

elves who crafted the ring yes also an

option

very well it's not an option no this

needs to be destroyed I feel like I'm

kind of caught in the middle of this so

I'll just I'll just you know what hey

where you are okay

[Laughter]

definitely definitely assessing all all

elements I remind you have spared

life twice her bodyguards sort of move

in next to her

there are pterodactyl Helm's staring at

you impassively the corpses of the

demons turning to occur behind them

let's say we are don't introduce us to

your new friend Miranda hi she like uses

her staff to make a bunch of flowers and

she like scoops up all the morning

glories and tosses them over to a

villain Strix is crawling towards man

soon to take his staff okay you pry that

out of his other hand and you can feel

the power coursing through this thing is

incredible it's also got a really nice

black robe that you think I'd also be

that whoa I'd okay I just started

dressing

he's just getting shaken right there

right there in the end I'm just pulling

his clothes off Paulding sees like like

evil and introducing to the ice lady and

strict and I'm like that that we're bit

this is well that's what you're doing

now that's what works Alton

introductions are important we are here

to be polite but also this ring is very

important why it doesn't need to return

to the people that made it technically

those are my people so I'm sorry I

didn't catch hi sorry I'm running clean

it's very nice to meet you you are

something like I have never seen before

where do you come from

Oh Miranda made me paltin the Dragons

under your control again just that boy I

was I was about to ask I just like just

it like is it like a vocal commander can

I just like tell it what to do with my

brain the other thing the second thing

okay can I just have it like just kind

of bend down and grab it collar and just

like all introductions are going on

you're just sort of waist it up on to it

CPAC excuse me if I may ask

I know there's a lot of argument going

on but uh if I may have the ring then

maybe I won't be destroyed with it now

let now that that were created but

that's important you're she's like are

you like this ice dragon like you'll go

away if if the ring doesn't create you

I'll not really coming kind of without

the ring she's definitely getting hurt

but that's the favor I need to ask the

summer queen even looks at all Sondra

with like big eyes and she's like true

love you know about true love

if the ring destroys this beautiful

relationship she's saying that your life

is just behind her holding the staff

like she is a truly sentient being as

well so that's I'm not controlled by the

ring by any means but I do believe that

if it is destroyed I might be as well I

feel like the more we all talk and the

more the scary lady just sits in silence

the more just the more power we lose in

this demo well I did ask her a question

and she did not respond as though ya

know why don't I join with you to those

why what do you mean why because I've

sworn an oath and I'm keeping my word so

what is your I've sworn an oath to

return this ring and we can do this

together

or we can do it another way

so you are okay with it being returned

to the summer court specifically breaks

Chris am i okay with it being returned

to the summer Court so it's supposed to

go to the elven Prince

not to the summer court now that being

said the you haven't talked to the elves

specifically about this situation so so

maybe journey to the house mmm it's not

beyond the realm of reason but you are

skeptical that the elves that you

promised this ring to are going to want

to see the ring destroyed that might

take some persuasion but you do you can

observe that this creature made of ice

who's talking to you this gwyneth who

seems to be have crafted by the ring

that you you know the ring well enough

to know that she's not wrong without the

ring to sustain her she will melt away

you want the ring to remain correct

Miranda I don't know are you willing to

lose your love over it because I can

tell you it's not a fun thing no I know

I know why nerd or that loss no but this

is this is not something that should be

given to anyone this is something that

is beyond anyone's power it should be

destroyed Strix is like raising your

hand behind everyone

so why don't we just polymorph er like

true polymorph like Simon Simon was not

a boy

Simon is now boy I did that's the mantle

boy yes he was not that he's now not a

metal boy and Simon you could explain

that if you feel not not a metal boy see

so all we need to do is go talk to my

best friend the black staff and she can

help us do a true polymorph this is this

is something that can happen yes

no we did it - Simon I want to win I

don't what you gonna do in here I know

that miranda is gonna take one of hands

and save this we'll take care of this I

was evil and in paltin you know that

person who owns the t-rex and the

bodyguards yes and say I think you can

help us

alessandro if you ride up a little bit

uh I'm sorry I'm sorry sometimes have a

speech impediment from having my head

hit on the ground to me anyway I think

if you help us walk up there with all of

your dinosaurs and things she might be

willing to help us plus the ring of

winter and maybe everyone else here

everyone wins except for strikes

everyone's a long time but strict isn't

losing right now so that's not neutral

that's Drive may have mansions clothes

draped over me and he is naked on the

group all this time in the background

just like I've gotten the ice dragon

just like roll over on is it possible

for me to walk up and take the ring off

of Alton you'd have to like kill him to

take it off him you can't you can't

divest you can't just seize equipment

that people have are wearing in there's

no mechanism for that or you have to you

have to incapacitate him somehow and cut

it off or rip it off at while he's

incapacitated or unconscious what if I

died I can't take it off and I'll come

with you yeh just have a really injure

bold personality once she's true

polymorph we could have a wedding I've

always wanted to do a wedding okay

that's enough time to go sorry Durning

about you're in you see you like palton

just got talking to us like wait no

Chris back up that seemed really

important to just gloss over so what is

the what is the agreement that most of

you have reached it's earned

we're going to the black staff to ask

the black staff to true polymorph

Gwyneth before a Lassonde takes the ring

to the elves or to the court whichever

is discussed and that point you decide

to leave vacate the destroyed yawning

portal and make your way to black staff

tower you see you see dirtiness is sort

of he's gone over sitting down on a

chair and is just pouring himself a

drink

I imagined during all this death was

talking to Durnan I'm guessing city

watch things of waste liking things like

reprimands and repair he's actually

surprised to find out that you're a

member of the city watch someone who

actually done didn't know when they blew

it that's fine

well those like discussions were going

on in the back door yeah he says he says

he's glad to make you no more extreme

renovations yeah nicer than before yeah

he doesn't seem terribly worried he says

he has a nice nest egg of put away for

just such dire emergencies and frankly

this can't help but add to the

reputation of the place ask him if he

wants any you know interior decorating

help he looks around at the carnage that

you've all inflicted and said no I think

you've helped let's go okay Murray I'm

just gonna go around and try and mend a

little a little bit no I'm really sorry

we didn't need I'm sorry it's just like

half of a table leg is fixed you mend a

table leg and then a big chunk of the

second floor just sort of falls behind

you I left the gauntlet on man soon he's

naked sure he's just the guy right right

yeah it's creepy and weird understood I

want that on the way out walks by walks

by him and just goes to his drink and

then just is like sorry buddy and like

gives it a little flick to like chill it

have the dragon breathe on a little bit

mm-hmm all right

so the ice dragon follows puffin out

tape tearing off the facade of the

building as it emerges whereupon you

find yourself you find that the street

outside is full of city watchmen and a

lot of arrested members of the santarem

who are being called try to take the

gauntlet off watching

oh no you can see also that members of

the watchful order which are basically

wizards in the employ of the city called

upon to defended moments of need have

also arrived and the black staff is here

she is over having a conversation with a

city watch sergeant that Vajra is a

svelte young woman with of course her

trademark have any black staff and

you've met her briefly before and she

turns and just rolls her eyes so far

into the back of her head like holding

this other staff and my staff I have to

do it once like awkwardly ones like

falling out I should have known no we

did it at Lanka man June he was super

evil anyway I have this sentient ice

being that needs to be Paul true

polymorphs so that we can destroy the

ring of winter which is also super evil

also I'm so lower friends let's get

coffee one day I can make you a pie

makes amazing pie

hi I'm Gweneth it's ice are you sure you

want to be something other than what you

are because you are really quite

beautiful Hey thank you yes I would like

to not melt but okay what would you like

to be Oh

normal but normal what what is it

everyone's an else the ring was enough I

think I don't know yeah Vash voucher

will say to Gweneth she'll just lean in

very quietly and she says people like

this a normality

I be mostly normal so what would you

like to be my dear um I am rather fond

of my wings okay

she says humans don't have wings so you

don't want to be a human what do you

want to be a bird just gonna turn to

Miranda

could she be Ana ladrón winter flavored

you know it's a theme voucher sort of

looks quizzically like she's not exactly

sure what you're talking about this

seems to be whatever whatever it is

you're describing is kind of out of her

field she says there are there are

legends of winged elves is that what

you're referring to sure close enough

they're called Avari el although they

have been gone from this world as far as

I know for millennia is that too much to

ask for well I'd like to do some

research before I do anything so drastic

perhaps the two of you could stay with

me

until we get this matter resolved I mean

I've never gotten to stay with her

that'll give us time to plan the wedding

Oh still the wedding um well we there's

there's a suggestion of a wedding which

we'll have to talk about um I think

might have commitment issues you've been

through what I've been through you would

understand but also I've been with her

for what six months that's a little

hasty well it's a conversation Strix has

put one of the healing pies into Basra's

row

okay with a note that just says lobster

eggs your crab

yeah so the black staff is willing to

entertain the idea and take Miranda and

gwennyth back to black staff tower to to

look at possibilities what can be done

but that still doesn't explain she says

the dinosaur and she looks at the

Triceratops across the street yeah I

don't really know are you there

does anybody own that Allyson Island ray

comes over and tells the black staff

that she owns it and that she is in the

service of the lady Alice andhe ray

Burton and gestures to you your

character Christina whereupon the black

staff looks at you with no like she

suddenly realizes who you are and she

says I didn't realize that you were in

the city my lady is there anything that

we could do to make your stay more

enjoyable and she looks around at all

the carnage I believe we have a long

journey ahead and some rest might be

nice you're more than welcome to come to

black staff tower as well everyone gets

this once everyone names um no that

would be thank you thank you for your

hospitality we've had quite a day and

yes we have much to discuss and we'll

take care of the cleanup here the rest

of you be off now sir makes a shoe move

at the dragon shoe there with me all

right well thank you vodka for not

hating me at least in helping my friends

is that a pie in my boot all right so

Alice sanda and her company Gwyneth and

Miranda you leave with the black staff

two black staff tower to get the matter

resolved but what of the ring it's

currently in Portland's possession this

is the like just while they're talking

just swoops by just nice dragon

oh no that's why I said they're with me

he's not going out of my sight at the

moment okay so palton what are you going

to give up the ring ah that's the ring

doesn't want you to now how am I feeling

about that before you can attempt to

even attempt to resist it if you want to

make it tourism you can make a charisma

saving throw to part with the ring

otherwise it owns your ass roll thank

you oh my god now don't just say roll

yeah look at the character arts 22:22

yeah you can part with the ring it

doesn't own you what do you what do you

do I'm like so

so I go to give I'm giving it to

Alessandra right is that what what the

agreement was I'm sure she'd like that

like I'm just like well as discussed and

agreed

here is the ring I am giving you

willingly do you always make things so

difficult a commute you really should

have some introspection at some point

you've got some serious issues when you

take the ring off him you see he can't

help himself it's like a huge burden of

sort of mental weight disappears from

him and his eyes revert to their normal

color not the sort of glowy blue the

crackly icy blue that has filled them up

to that moment even is who's standing

nearby is so proud and she goes to like

hug him and then she goes to like she's

kind of like she's chuck's him on the

shoulder and she and the RIC the ring

says to you sort of telepathically

Alessandra oh is the dragon still

out yeah no it's just now looking toward

a Lassonde serve dumbly I just give a

pat and just like you did you did good

Bessie never forget you that communicate

with this dragon when you were tuned to

the ring you can take about five minutes

can I ask it what its name is cuz I

don't think Bessie is you don't you

don't think it would actually no it's

it's such a it's such a it's just a

construct that exists to serve you it

doesn't really have an identity but yes

you now have the ring and it does not

dare try to force its will upon you

wonderful it just remains very quiet yes

until next time all right

thanks for stopping by come back anytime

we love it I mean it's not make it to

let's not make it a habit I saved your

life that was a lie

I played you a song

free performance from Paulding SEPA so

when daddy needed help I love you guys

this is like eating a pie with like the

four robes on her shoulders starts

gathering everybody into a group hug

strikes reluctantly leans in yeah

alright so you have your moment in a

slight coda small coda sometime later

Durnin decides to take his sword and

hack the iron gauntlet off of mention

any puts it in a law he puts it in a

locked chest

in a back room nicely on in court to get

the hand is actually attached to his

body

Miranda taken at all you want to take it

out great then you and now have the hand

with you oh I mean I like weird stuff

too but not weird evil magical stuff I

draw a line then well while you're

basically walking Miranda you can feel

the hand moving you know cool I'm just

gonna like take the gauntlet and try and

dump the hand out get out there is no

hand there's nothing inside the actual

articulated limb is moving okay that's

where we'll stop you know if there's

weird I'm gonna try and take it of

two mansions your green demons the ice

questionable assassin one two three four

five six seven eight eight other people

you introduced there are like 25 people

disappear in that moment so Terrence got

sucked down by I'm sorry Terrence got

sucked down by an imprisonment spell and

is basically trapped in the bowels of

the world oh it's dead

no she's not dead she's salad China yeah

giant it's true a black sack and just so

many one they can do anything as what

Strix thinks yeah also there's not a

staff of power I just loot it off and

sure is robe of the Archmage what yeah

and so so but I'll

Sanda if you when you if anybody

describes to the black staff she can
