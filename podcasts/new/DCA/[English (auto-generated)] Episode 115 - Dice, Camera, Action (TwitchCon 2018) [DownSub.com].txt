welcome to our live show but seriously

I'm Chris Perkins I will be your dungeon

master and your bad guy tonight thanks

now if you're in the audience and you

have never participated in a D&D game or

watched the D&D game before there's

something you need to know right away

and that is this is not scripted we're

making this up as we go along D&D is a

game of shared storytelling involving

all the participants I as the dungeon

master will set the scene and keep the

story moving forward but it's really the

players in this escapade who will face

the gravest challenges and making

decisions that will keep them alive as

long as possible now before I begin I

would like to introduce been loads of

Sirens scape who will be providing

today's orchestral accompaniment and all

of the sundry special effects that will

haunt you in your dreams so here is the

story that we're going to tell today we

are in the city of Waterdeep and there

is a festival called sorne in now this

is a festival where nobles and other

influential people gather to meet in

peace with their traditional enemies

it's the only day of the year where they

can't kill each other and it is seen as

a great sign of respect to host an event

where enemies can gather peacefully for

one night of revelry before going back

to their day to day business of wanting

each other dead

so it is on this night that the waffle

crew our heroes have been invited by a

noble woman named lady s valet Rosner to

attend a horn in gathering at the house

of one of her hated rivals the house

Marg Astor and it is in this house

haunted house where our story unfolds

allow me to introduce you now to our

four heroes and their gracious hostess

here is the waffle crew and lady Rajan

are joining us on stage I'm gonna give

each of them a chance to introduce

themselves to you I don't want to sit by

you

I'm strict I am 80 fleeing sorcerer and

I'm a trash which and what's that you

got in your hand strings so why what's

that magical lamp you've got Oh oh yeah

so I usually have a staff but it can

polymorph into other things including a

lantern and this is cuz it's spooky

and that's it I didn't dress myself evil

here I should warn you in advance that

normally D&D is played around a table

we're not gonna do that here as you can

see there is no table we will be using

this space as they are now I will use

this space splendid splendid

so you have all now entered the Marg

Astor Manor and have discovered that

you're not the only ones here there are

in this extravagant large house sorry

guys this is for my which stream ah

there we go there we are in this large

house there are scores of Nobles

brushing shoulders an undercurrent of

animosity well suppressed by wine and

good food and you have seen what you

assume to be members of the Marg Astor

family welcoming various people but for

whatever reason they don't seem to want

anything to do

with lady Rosner she seems to be not

welcome harsh well yeah we're not

welcome lots of things either and lady

Russian are you know that your family

has had a difficult time in Waterdeep

over the years you were actually you and

your family will run out of town once

for all kinds of criminal activity yes

and so it may even on a night like Sorna

it seems not all hatchets can be

unburied don't mind me so there are

Nobles in various rooms but you have now

find yourself quietly sequestered to the

library

I've been sequestered in the library the

whole time but your hair looks so pretty

I hate it but but I did it I hate it why

it itches can you take your coat off why

cuz I loaned you that dress and it's

real pretty I like the coat but it's not

cold she's wearing a dress she looks

real pretty I'm not wearing a dress

she's wearing a dress that's never

there's a dress under there did you rip

the dress yeah

I'll take the coat off if we can leave

leave where I don't don't want to be

here at a part they don't like it

there's so many festivities still to

have there's no festivities and I don't

like talking to you I think you look

absolutely darling don't you feel so

much better

too much freer it's okay I love it when

you do that to me it's fine nice dude

look whatever it is you need us to do

here let's get it done so we can get out

this must be enjoying it I like this

woman why can't we just go to a party

here awhile I don't I just feel out of

place

well your hair looks nice Thanks I don't

like your tag line it could be cool this

is very exciting I'm gonna find one okay

it's okay

oh please thank the register let's be

blended so your friends seem nice yeah

they're the best yeah really

um entertaining delightful yeah

wonderful thank you

and this isn't so whatever it is you

need us to do just let us know so we can

be done with it

just little heads-up be sure to leave

enough room for Lysander

my kids have fun is it okay if I

fireball this place because I think I'm

ready to probably you see a couple

nobles sort of try to blunder into the

library looking for a quiet place to

make out and realizing that you're here

in sort of do an about-face and turn

around and leave the servants who glide

past the doorways with their platters of

wine look at you and don't stop and just

keep on walking away yeah but I need

that no please I don't want to feel

anymore

oh that's a mood what did you do to make

everyone so mad at you

me personally nothing I have done

absolutely nothing everything is great

but my family some hundreds of years ago

I mean it's old news at this point it's

practically forgettable did nothing bad

at all there was perhaps a little issue

with them slavery that we may have

dabbled into well either way it seems

like you're not the only one not welcome

here so I'm not sure what we're doing

here I mean we are putting on airs and

and perhaps on this great day we could

be welcome

buddy it's a party get lyddie

yeah what's the whatever that means

right right Oh see Thanks

how did you two meet and get so close he

crawled into my family window and scared

my mother what those are mom I mean from

what I heard and your mom still around I

kind of like a gray kind of so of this

party though it's absolutely amazing

in fact I there's there's so many onyx

odd white lovely I really wanted that

back afterwards I'm sorry you know I was

very much hoping to put on a good good

show here so going back to this window

yeah we found that fingers again yeah

let's get back to that your mom is one

still around alive living in your home

state I heard you're usually not this

forward with me okay but there's so many

good good wine and good good for my

attention here hold this would you thank

you so much I will definitely be back

all of you

don't worry about it go ahead look

around I'm sure that um now that I've

left you'll definitely get some service

but go ahead have a great time and I'll

definitely be back soon don't even worry

about it

everything is totally fine not yet

I don't like you so you find yourselves

now alone in the quiet library of the

house Marg Astor but you hear the noise

of the party all around you mostly just

talking among various Nobles it sounds

almost like secret whispered

conspiracies against you I think us

so what also it only seems you reckon

it's your imagination getting the better

of you are there any cool books in here

the place is full of cool books yeah I'm

looking at all of them I'm not talking

to anyone all right

and I successfully find my wine you have

been looking all over the place for the

wine and have nots bucks this party

sucks I'm actually agreeing with the

palton on this one well I'm sure there's

lots of this place to explore we could

try to find somewhere cooler to hang

into that the room gets very very cold

all of a sudden you told me to take my

jacket off now I'm cold I feel cold feel

in this large house a draught come

through the room is said draught

familiar I was I would like you to make

common perception checks yeah so get

thee to a dice station oh and roll your

dice there's a dice station over here

hey I have this rug in my house ooh

13:13 cool yeah 11:21

that's good

[Music]

really the first role and it's in that

20 what do you expect it's a good

cutscene paltin yes you come from

Supernatural roots and something in your

spine tingles as you feel a vaporous

entity forming nearby

spectral presence Wow as a ghost

manifests behind man G yeah he got

slapped I couldn't even connect with his

face I mean corporal no I thought it was

it was just it was that impactful so

kudos I will Lady Margaret you were kind

of turned off by the presence of a Raj

Nair in your library it was only after

she left that you felt it well in

decorum to present yourself I am

presenting myself to you this ragtag

trash that's me these are nice clothes

you do look okay thank you but this

particular piece of trash how dare you

enter this library after you ruined my

funeral sir what hype Alton SEPA I don't

think we've actually met it was okay

okay lots of that alright well do you

not remember five years before this when

you were the most glorious event of the

season my death when the small peasant

children are singing in a chorus and the

lovely black gowns were covered with all

the people who are worth something not

the peasants

and you sir you pursued by all the gods

and the pigs of the town read through my

funeral something you do yeah I mean you

were drunk

I believe her yeah you probably should

apologize anyway because rats do I

remember this it may there's something

in the wine haze of your younger days

that maybe it maybe it's true but you

may have been in one of your

transcendental wine and do students look

all I'm saying is that it may or may not

have happened but for what it's worth I

don't really remember it and for what

it's really worth

I'm sorry well I mean we're apologizing

to go so I'm gonna go hide under that

bench over there that actually makes me

feel a little bit better about being

murdered thank you very much absolutely

you were murdered do you want to talk

about it Oh have a seat if you can't I

do oh sorry let me move the this

definitely not an iPad oh I can't feel

that at all yes it is a burden to have

been murdered and not be able to move on

from this life but it is a burden I bear

isn't it something that we could help

with I mean you could track down which

family better

yeah well murdered me that would be very

convenient it was one of your own family

members I mean I suspect as much there

are so many backstab amara Guster's

really we were raised as Viper so I

don't know why I'm surprised but it is a

bit of a disappointment

tread since you guys aren't having fun

at the party maybe we need a quest find

out who murdered this lovely blue woman

who are so observant I try I love this

one the rest of you can leave fantastic

find yourselves in an armory I found

myself in an armory well let's all go to

the armory then I mean if one guys I

found myself in an armory it was really

enlightening I shove at least four books

into my courses you shouldn't just leave

your sword lying around

oh absolutely shouldn't especially with

definitely not this is nice it's not

ours don't get too excited

well there's lots of weapons I like

weapons look at this one yes it's

beautiful yeah all right let's focus for

a moment so who's the ghosts name again

you hear a voice say s Parrilla

sarsaparilla sarsaparilla sarsaparilla

aspirin

Casper Ella Casper eller HAP's here we

go

Chris all right Marilla Oh Casper Ella

carry on I asked Coachella got it well

murder mystery parties can be really fun

I have Casper Ella was murdered and

supposedly by a family member and we're

here on lady ass fillets behalf who was

already acting very very ah it was ID

actually what was not jump to that but I

do believe she might know something

or perhaps be involved well maybe you

should use some of your favor with her

to find out mmm yes only ever favor with

her there was a like favor to me yeah

there was a pulsing favor a favor fancy

I don't know what that means they have

fear you hear a disturbance downstairs

and it sounds like a riot has erupted in

another part of the house you hear the

sound of glasses as in wine glasses

smashing on the floor the gasps of women

and men alike

there seems to be some sort of fracas

like like the sounds you would hear in a

mob as if some raging beast had just

come stampeding into the house

thrashing tearing its way up the stairs

toward you

oh it came crashing in yes it came

crashing in and is getting louder and

louder and louder it's boring to mine

no okay radiant sword goes on I know we

said it's not ours but we'll come back

when we're done well there's anything

that's good for a party it's a fight

right I'm behind Chris Perkins question

yes did I happen to bring my gun to this

party which I have so no you have said

gun on you we don't match ensued you

don't even know how to use it well

that's why you learned yeah you wish to

say that you have the gun you can have

that's a thing that has been said in

Dungeons & Dragons now it is a it is a

flintlock pistol as you know that you

have to load the smoke powder you get to

work it makes a very loud sound

fantastic I feel like when Perkins gets

that look about learning to use a gun we

should maybe be concerned yeah if that's

more reason you might have to roll for

the thrashing sound gets louder until

blasting into the artery oh are two

gentlemen that you have never laid eyes

on before but of such grim countenance

and purpose were they wasn't you cause

in that fracas we would never cause a

fracas hi I believe you know we're here

for the party

find somewhere cooler

evil will be gone forever

from his prison in Berea I'm unleashed

as in black may have accidentally left

with him okay mistakes were made so

where is he we gave him two he wasn't at

all is he here

mistakes so had the doll great trusted

someone to take care of that for us oh

we took the doll out of burrow via which

it was real safe and doll dolls are safe

places to keep vampire

overlord

and then we killed a kid to put him in

there this was kill our guest our

servant pokes his head in and says you

don't have invitations here gentlemen

you don't belong here you should leave

at once or I'll call the city watch but

we don't like an all-access badge it's

okay

we don't lady yes filet it's already

we're vendors there's no violence here

this is soaring the festival of peace

look there is nothing that is going to

stand in our way to get you to strike

what if it's like a really big what is

your name wise man what I am as you said

wise mouth what is your name van Rycke

t'en so van rycke tin he says been

written is the man who trained you yes

also family member because we do share a

name where just think it is think so

hair really makes a difference it does

I've never yeah I wouldn't never guess

I've never seen you before oh it's okay

I know the straw doll that held him was

found weeks ago right back to the plot

wait why didn't you tell us because I

didn't wanna worry you it's I'm worried

now

the doll itself almost as if like the

entire stuffing inside of it was removed

so it was just the skin remaining so

just just to recap yeah we went on an

epic quest to rid the world of the

vampire Straub yes pretty then we

trapped him in a doll and then we

thought the doll was safe but it turns

out the dolls not save and then you knew

that but then you didn't tell us what

was I wasn't hiding it

I was hiding it behind my bed yes well

we had other things going on and just

question mmm

why are you hiding the doll behind your

bed yeah that's a good question yeah

yeah do not scare everyone else or worry

them I don't make great decisions we're

so glad he's the lead look the important

part never the important part is that

remains that the doll was found within

the manor of lady s fillet her a

supposedly mother had it she said I met

her but she was more like a apparition

like a kind of great girl she screamed

oh they go I don't know she seemed

pretty wails there I don't know I went

to the Attic found book open coffin with

the straw doll in there when I came back

down he's gone back up you just breezed

over it we went to the Attic yes

found a coffin what was open we got it

oh we found a lot of that's why I want

to ask her but she was gone hey we

glossed over that stuff a lot this shows

kind of weird okay okay yeah well there

are also dozens of bats living in there

that's why I was trying to help I came

back down and she was gone and I don't

know why and that's when I took the doll

and ran well I divine your bed behind

yes so that other people couldn't find

it or take it it is a doll of what else

great better go ahead yeah huh what else

you keep back there nothing a couple

members of house Marg Astor's guard show

up two men in the houses livery you can

see that they've got their swords

sheathed but they have a countenance

about them gentlemen that suggests they

are going to take you from the room look

more than a little terrified at the

prospect

that's not let's let's draw swords it's

just it's a nice party we're all here

partying together not doing any kind of

violence is this what a party Helen's

one of the guards says with you they

sure are can I roll a persuasion check

[Laughter]

I need to go get I left my dice in the

living room

we also hunt but we travel with dice yes

they sure are with me so evil in there

is something there's a certain genetic

quoi magic about you that when they look

into your eyes and they see the radiance

of your faith just erupting from every

pore of your body they could not

possibly deny that you are telling the

truth nor could they ever stand in the

way of any wish that you so desired what

they they bow and retreat and disappear

into the shadows of the house I do

evening yeah just safe to young

gentleman's lives did didn't we're not

talking about us

yeah not us not us he's gonna body them

don't talk easy put that coffee

well I'm got bodied me too

well if you're here after straw then I

just need to know where this doll is

yeah where is it Chris we're going to

leave the doll it's not here oh good the

DM said where did you leave it not here

I put a pie behind your bed

that's how will I hit it look if you're

after Stroud then you're certainly no

enemies of ours and if anything we're

allies because we've had plenty of

encounters with them and we're all been

spending along a lot of our years is a

strong word

well if you bet as our vampire hunters

we are I'm a hunter of vile creature

hunter about violence right and girls

vile creatures and girls and hopefully

vampires too but if you are said hunters

maybe you have some way of finding

estrade that we could help with because

obviously we have no idea what we're

doing at all all right so you guys won't

pay with me searching the premises I'm

certainly fine a bit take a look around

absolutely if anything this videos

really is the most suspicious all right

you do you take that side oh no roll

some dice for a reason I don't know

maybe a investigation investigation

exactly that I'm helping I don't like

two weeks so it's that's gonna be yes

yes all right

as you look around and you're searching

the house for signs of your quarry

Kristina's here Nobles speak of a tall

mysterious stranger who arrived it

seemed to be the way he was dressed he

was from another time and they tried to

tell you where he is but they can't

remember where he walked off to they

tried to tell you who

remember his name almost as if they were

spellbound in the moment by him but you

find him in the library of course this

library and he has he you find him

sitting in a chair having a delightful

conversation with Lady Margaret ghost

[Applause]

isn't it funny when I'm very old and I'm

floor and he is basically saying oh yes

former wives is it goes really yes

was missing the whole time you were

really trying the three of them I'm

nice monologue by the way really nice

glint in the eye it was gorgeous it it

hurts to bring back up but the people

need to know I mean you could tell it

again they don't have a c2 you know just

in case we're enemies put aside their

differences oh yeah coexist in peaceful

harmony no to violate the peaceful

Accord of the sword fest would be to

condemn yourself to death or worse I

mean your ass for it my wrath I don't

want her wrap

what is your wrath consistent way in the

scale it consists of a horrifying visage

where I can age you a pretty little face

with the roll of a dice a massage it was

hello I have the biggest castle he's a

wonder to behold I can't wait to see it

I wish I could leave the grounds of my

my own city but I was murdered here and

I'm caught here until someone frees me

happy in my castle we were having a

great then they put ask me in the door

with someone we may have trapped in a

doll but how was it how was being in a

doll sometimes that could be fun

maybe hast wrought it was not fun evylyn

there's no need for pleasantries with

straud I'm smelling the escalation of

aggression here and I must persuade all

of you to leave your conflict the height

this is the Soron fest you do not want

to be known as those who broke the peace

cause violence but that doesn't mean our

words don't have daggers tied to them I

him working many angles oh that's nice

but you're open to that I'm a ghost I

gotta get what I can all right I'm just

working on my technique that's all relax

let's try it if you're here also under

this time of peace that means you

probably need something from us unless

you just want to spook us which you

succeeded we're spooked time to go

you missed the doll don't you you want

it that's that's what it is

it's you've grown up you've grown

accustomed to it and it's you feel it as

home now is it right he ruined my

funeral he's terrible look they're all

laughing so I'm gonna keep going with it

you know don't you

Bobby stop all right we are now in

initiative so first thing's gonna happen

is you get to make an attack roll my

friend yes I don't so roll a die here I

have one right here my iPad 12 wheels

all right

so your blow scuffs off my armor alright

but with his butt but I have a sneak

attack

vamsee there we go see if that baby

bandage I got a longer than advantage

here saying umm yeah 5 b6 alright so you

can make a second attack roll because

you have advantage because your sneak

attacking so let's see if you can roll

higher than a 12 all right good

great do you need these sixes I gotcha

oh right don't need them he's gonna need

them pray for the boy oh hey still count

still counts as long as it's right yeah

hey baby oh yeah boy all right

cuckoos so you plunge your weapon deep

into the vampire you roll your damage a

sword caused it sounds like oh I'm small

you messed up yes that's so he just sort

of pins straud to the chair if somebody

do you want to roll your damage or cuz

that'll feel good I'll roll it excellent

yes I thought you were new at this

they'll put this time it's really easy

to hit someone from behind doing it

assignment by hacked is broken at once

I am livid and I would like to make a

move where there the chance to do it as

soon as I get the damage from all right

so Balthasar

21:21 points of damage described he goes

ow

big-big it that's that don't collapse

so you've impaled the vampire briefly

and cop him not wise he was kind of

expecting this betrayal but I think what

he was also counting on was the ferocity

of his undead hostess oh oh no that's

not good no angry I don't know whether

to punish everyone read it what does

everyone think one person don't listen

to one person we have at least another

hour to fill in a foe and I will say not

in my house and I will do four fine

missin your face twists into a horrible

horrible death mask cool girl you need

some night cream not Lee and I will have

to roll in on a dead creature within 60

feet of me I'm good uh you are that's

why I picked this one must succeed on a

DC thirteen wisdom saving throw or be

frightened for one minute one good thing

is I'm a hearty friend remember remember

that everyone who's standing in my aura

has plus five to their saving throw oh

my god and in fact is this or be

frightened oh what's that

it's they would be frightened that's the

only thing yes so no one in my aura can

be Fred

our dancer horrified as this paladin's

or a basin I just mom everybody yes now

that's fine I liked that okay but these

two quick and see her need to roll okay

alright Baltazar Dragomir this is a

wisdom saving throat you don't get mom

goodness gracious what I believe yes DC

13 per fect that's a six I'm it if you

feel my fiber more let me know that's a

five okay

if the save fails by five or more may

would you like to say that I don't

please oh the target also ages one D

four times ten years what were we

rolling so your wisdom walking back and

all of a sudden my wisdom Wendy Wendy

for I need to get a visa more here we go

1b 424 it's only ten years I'll take

that

so the Brothers Grimm here both aged ten

years before the rest of your eyes

distinguish those we are with them goes

up to us and because the source of your

fear is Lady Margaret as she is within

your site you have disadvantage on all

your attack roles because you are so

terrified of her presence nice really

team knocking team yes what's your name

again

[Laughter]

poutine yes that's the one routine okay

she's straw I was next it's my sword

retaliation that's awesome it's me

standing on my cloak I know what you're

thinking alright

I mean I will not attack them my lady

without your permission even though they

have broken the sword in fact I will not

do the same he was their asses were

punished us oh no no no it's just the

beginning I told you it was the gravest

offence

so like my mom all right

straw draws his blade and levels it at

the paladin good morning and then he

says kill them boys and coming out among

the various side chambers disguised as

ordinary folk you see several people

charged into the room with short swords

and as they bear down on you you see

that their human features give away to

rat-like visages yomi's you know to be

where rats

oh they begin to swarm into the room and

attack people from both sides

yes okay but stride has to make an

attack roll against evil image and he

rules let the under shot spawn me you

you are not wearing your armor because

you are at a party I wore some bracers

to the party so what is your armor class

without your armor oh that's a good

question Chris Perkins umm straat I mean

straw that's a good question I believe

my breastplate is plus to your

breastplate is normally a c14 oh I don't

know I've never not worn my breastplate

ever before what's your dexterity bonus

my decks bonus is +2 okay so your AC is

12

even with my braces are a shield

technically Oh so 14 okay 13 okay you

deflect strods attack by the light of

Lysander I rebuke you

yes then my minions accost all of the

rest of you can I kick him that is a 22

hit so that's gonna hit you Wow Strix

the one on you missus palton the one on

you mrs. sweet lady ROG I'm sorry

mysterious woman Master you are critical

hidden Roger can i god I'm sad to say

and you know that a particular where rat

doesn't attack you with his sword but

sinks his fangs 5 feet of me yes I want

to use my protection fighting style to

impose disadvantage on straw Don that

okay for the way Rhett that's a Miss

then hi so you are miss lady Rajan re

the lady in the mask you're killing me

here sorry literally yeah as one of

these creatures now clinging to her and

then two of them are going to attack the

brothers that's fine Balki's are

brothers you are able to fight one off

as he tries to stab you with a rusty old

short sword and then the one on you

Dragomir you also deflect it andele and

you can tell you have been well trained

against these sorts of like anthropic

threats they are practically incompetent

these fighters come on strongest of my

time we're scared we can do this still

yeah and strawed laments taught me mr

gasser that this is the best you could

find in this wretched hellhole of a city

you call home what it's doing okay mom

water deep not nice all right

so you take some damage there

mass lady oh so you take nine points of

damage as the where rat sinks his fangs

into you and it's the most horrible bite

you have ever experienced

uh-huh I've experienced some bites and

yes there is as it pulls its fangs away

it says and now it is dragon there's

turn I'm going to just straight-up

attack you and I can do that twice yes

you and your brother yes are costing me

with your magical weapons yeah for yeah

it's a 408 okay I parry your blow okay

and good laughs all right well van Rycke

didn't train will rude hard it's their

first time 6 plus 8 is 14

he's a real strong man hired deflected

so I don't take my eyes off of evylyn as

these two are cost me my wound dealt by

your sword starts to mint like it wasn't

there yeah that happens yeah not

completely

the wound was far greater than my

regeneration could account for but that

wound is slowly going away black Viper

you have a wear rat on you what would

you like to do I would like to not I

would like to hit it off please thank

you okay he has already sort of detached

from you so at this point you are

fighting him but he is not grappling

onto you yes what would you like to do I

would like to hit him with this side of

the stick all right go ahead and make

your attack role and also I attack three

times so I would like to hit him all the

times at this side of the stick all

right so you can't wait I gotta get a

plus with us 21 at home in vino one okay

and then he 12 you knock some of Lady

Margaret's property oh wait sneak attack

also okay

that's a plus 14 sneak attack you need

to have some sort of advantage since

you're fighting the whereat alone you

have none I mean I could but you did it

but you did hit twice oh I hit twice yes

excellent excellent

so that is does anyone have a pair of

sixes for me I have something there

there should be a couple there all right

so that's a that's 13 on the one

let's see seven that's 10 on the other

okay

that one looks grievously wounded you

don't think he could take another

barrage such as that and he sort of cows

from you and hisses in pain rivaling

what would you like to do straw is just

kind of mean bugging me yes I say

something to the effect of like you can

look all you want but if you try to

touch any of them you lose those eyes

mine doesn't do that all right so he is

pressing you and you're fighting back

are you trying to actually wound him are

you just playing you know yeah if you

attacked first

yeah then I'm gonna go ahead and take

some swings out in right our bat hole

sort of plays across the room into the

armory okay okay okay make your attack

roll the flames light the room whoo my

attack is Plus hold on D&D be on rescue

my attack with the flame sword is plus

eight so that means in eighteen that

hits all right and I'm gonna need some

damage and I left my days over there

that's gonna be 9 + 7 is 16 plus 4 is 20

and I think I think I would throw some

divine smite on top of that I also have

improved divine smite so I get a plus s

d8 already so let's just find out what

the d8 would have given me

anyone got a d8 oh my god lines all

right an extra one so that's 21 and then

we'll add divine smite which I think can

give me 3 mm-hmm at that level so ok 23

31 and 33 all right that is a nasty

wound and your divine smite is radiant

damage correct that's right okay so that

seems to grievously hurt strawed and cut

him to the core burn by the light of

Lysander all right coming back to a

second time get ready that's gonna be a

20 okay so that's gonna be a total of 11

plus 11 is 22 plus the improved divine

smite is 28 and let's add divine smite

on top now let's do that let's go ahead

28 34 36 39 be alright

[Applause]

yeah we're not looking for anymore so

daggered by that paltin yep

you see battling playing out between

good and evil in the armory

Lady Margaret is still a fierce mask of

horror and the brothers are sort of

trembling in her presence it's all right

guys first times always kind of scary

well I'm just kind of okay alright make

my way over here middle of this fight

okay - holy swords Paul Torres oh here

we go

so I'm gonna go for Sun sword and try

and jab it and good that's real with

Andrey mm-hmm

so that is Vanessa it's plus plus my Dex

is there any kind of boost with your or

no that is on the side which sucks as it

would have been a 20 it looks like a 20

to me can we can we have the DM why me

the DM ruling on whether that's a oh

that is whoa no that's not a tilt die

that's a 20 ah

okay say all right buddy game is not fun

anymore

no it's fine it's good it's really good

okay and what's the damage

hold on please hold all right so it's

one the eight plus four so to d8 all

right so we've got two and two

okay so four plus or so eight radiant

okay I don't like that let's do that

I said pick that up in me and I feel

radiant damage where the Sun don't shine

well now it's outshine there all right

and so as you rip your weapon out of my

wound

it is DF turn alright cool

I wasn't the impression this was a party

so I did not beat you no weapon

now it's a party party so instead I'm

going to focus and Moon splinter appears

into my hands okay how far away is the

armoury from the room that I'm currently

in it is this far oh great okay so I'm

use my cunning action to - for extra

movement and before I go I'm gonna look

at Strix and just gesture to the raster

just say blast oh okay so it's my extra

movement it's over into the armory and

I'll grab what I will count as a short

sword yeah all right there we go

and then from and then for like the rest

of my movement I go up to the where rat

that is fighting this mysterious figure

and I'm not idiot but she was sneaking

around like an idiot and I saw all of

that sneaking around like an idiot or

sneaking around like a fox

open for interpretation I like an idiot

box I'm so and uh I mean I've got pretty

high passive perceptions I don't know if

I also like immediately recognized her

or what well make an insight check ok

that's not my strongest suit perfect

five nope she has totally Clark Kent at

your ass and this strange woman who came

out of nowhere and is being accosted

doesn't look like she necessarily fits

in this venue

what would the mask and all you can only

imagine what her motives are all right

well great

the fireballer right yeah give me a

second so still suspicious from there so

yeah so Amelia grabbing this sword we're

at honor since it's an ally attacking it

it's like immediately back up into like

a sneaky Tech we're at to finish it off

what is it like right back to her and

mean like so we're gonna try to attack

roll-on we're at okay with sneak attack

no I know I'm potent poison so sneak

attack attempt at the we're at and ride

to whatever weapon this is that is it

Rob or not it's probably not silver

probably not great

all right well DF isn't thinking

straight so let's do an attack role yep

was their advantage you have advantage

because with an ally all right so that

was a

[Applause]

13 so with the 13 you are able to hit

this route but your weapon is magically

rebuffed it appears this lycanthrope ik

creature is not hurt at all by non

magical weapons so I literally hit it

with a wooden sword but it did feel it's

like hitting somebody with a sword it's

okay still feels it it just doesn't take

any damage alright where you get its

intention if nothing else I don't want

that Strix watch this all play out what

do you do so I don't recognize her

either right you can make an insight

check okay okay please let I don't like

her so can I just do it anyway that's

ten you do not recognize her cool I

don't care either I don't like her so

all the way rats yeah yeah but you're

still in the room yeah okay you got it

all right well sorry everyone so I'm

gonna first go ahead and I'm gonna cast

fireball at fifth level fireball

I have on CERN's well here's the thing

okay

you said blasted blessed then I mean

about everything open to interpretation

either fireball or chickens oh it was

fireball I got was impending fire I mean

we burned down our own house why not

burn down this yeah you're right okay

all right maybe be a little careful they

worked really hard on this set and its

really nice and I just I would I'd hate

to see hard work go to waste

well and Strix you're targeting the

whereas yes who else you targeting well

I don't care about anyone else in this

room except for well these guys they

feel bad for them thank you and then

over here bleed our pants but I don't

recognize her so well okay so everybody

except your friends and the vampire

hunter brothers Wow have to make saving

throws what's your deal well unless I

saw it was deep trying to help her it

was looks like that's how it's trying to

do yeah yeah it looks like he is trying

to okay well if you're trying to help

her I won't fireball her okay but lady

Marga

you are being targeted by a fireball oh

great so we're gonna need a saving throw

again a dexterity saving throw okay I

have a thirteen plus one all right not

the best 15 how does that square with

your DC it's 16 suck it alright so both

the ghost lady Margot sir and the

vampire strawed are caught full blast in

the fireball and

oh god this dice all yay all of the

where rats except one are caught in the

fireball that's a 33 so a huge

conflagration fills these two chambers

[Applause]

Lady Margaret

him you take some damage how much damage

would I take because I'm very very weak

how many good for I have eight hole hit

point eight eight that can't be right

well that's what you gave must be a

clerical error beyond I mean you can't

just go in there and change this I'm

very I'm dead again so can I get my ten

years back now that she's done yeah push

it

thank you sure it wasn't like 80 yeah

alright later our gaster as a reaction

I'm going to let you try to possess

somebody Oh what not it I yeah hurl

myself backwards from the fire into the

nearest humanoid I could find oh yeah

this one this one right here

so as this ghost comes flying back

toward you Balthasar yes are you

I have resistance are you going to try

to resist her yes all right

of course I'll need you to make a safety

first against dr. session not today

ghost not today let's go 15 that's

pretty good what is the DC is 1300

charisma yes sir

you are rebuffed and in this incident

consumed by the flames

[Laughter]

[Applause]

now the good thing about ghosts is they

can only be dead for 24 hours and they

reform until the source of their death

the original death ends so with lady

monster enveloped in flames before you

Balthasar shrieking you see with some

sadness the sorrow in her eyes that you

would not allow her into your being

sounds like me I'm pretty much a softy

when it comes to that yeah yeah okay

and we come back around to you hey we

figured out who killed her so what would

you like to do strawed in battle the

we're rats have been consumed by flame

and are now just lying here wait

question I'm picking bits off those we

were looking for the killer yes so he

just saw it yeah yes yeah so now we can

tell them now we can tell them what's up

yeah but wait there's more they can help

us okay well tell them maybe we should

wait until we're doctor yes dumbass good

morning

well you know the pilot the Paladin and

the rogue are doing a pretty good job of

killing it you don't know how much

longer I'll be able to keep it together

right but it's really up to you

Balthasar what you would like to do at

this face I want to finish you off okay

that's the goal

absolutely freezing so bring your attack

let's see what you got all right I'm

gonna use my moon touch sword yes how's

your mood style bro oh yeah I wrote this

hmm so that with your bonus is going to

hit and my bonus is for yes so your moon

touch sword is going to cut through me

and I need damage now you've got sneak

attack damage oh yeah on top of this oh

yes I got a row five Don yeah

cool oops so that was for the 19 oh okay

I'm gonna roll one to go with that it's

wonderful

okay hey I'm good at hunting always

LeBron is looking bloody whoa ah wait

really

yes well you have done a crapload of

damage damn fireballs

so our fancy new sword fire sword just

laser swords this just means we have

bigger problems than swords all kinds of

swords

after you act I go and I look deep into

your eyes Balthazar and I say we are not

enemies we don't have to be enemies we

were destined to fight side by side and

I am trying to charm that you yeah so I

need you to make a saving throw a wisdom

saving throw against my charm as I try

to dispel you know when I think about it

me vampires were not that much different

I'm dead on the inside just like them so

give me a a wisdom saving throw

Chris do I pick up on this yes is this a

spell this is not a spell sick all right

you are now under my sway oh that was

smooth that's not good that's not good

yeah and Dragomir you see your brother

yep as fan written warned you thank you

or isn't the vampire strong you see your

brother's to come to the vampires charm

taken hey what if my brother and he

starts struts and starts telling you

telepathic messages saying protect me

from them oh you are going down stay

away from them hey I'll see the light

now dragomir well we just like to do I

mean the fear that lady Marcus to put

upon you on on I'm looking for something

no the vampire now has your brother and

thrall all I'm seeing in here is brute

force and it didn't work too well on you

okay so I am going to someone to have

something that can like get him out of

his brain at some point are you are you

literally a penis that yeah cuz like we

don't know you guys yeah I hit a rat

with a wooden stick okay I got big

really hard ah I'm going to attempt to

knock my brother unconscious oh you

believe that that is a good course of

action that if a person in spelled by

the vampire can takes enough damage

essentially you can break their hold so

you have at it okay brother

I gotta make runner I gotta make sure

I'm doing this Rex when I swung on you

there was I hit nothing yeah I'm just

swinging yes you're using your magical

weapons here plus ten on your role well

that would have helped me against you

I'm not yes and if you hit you do a d-10

plus six okay yeah

hey that is a 5 plus 10 is 15

what's your armor class Balthasar good

question

you can tell he's evil not he's got the

sunglasses on that's right light armor

oh snap

okay yeah so my armor is right on

request 15 exactly yes yes so roll

damage on your brother okay

don't hurt me too bad bro okay so you

take 12 points of damage but I'm

swinging like I didn't look at the butt

in the temp okay yeah so you're

basically watching damage yeah all right

so after taking the twelve points of

damage you're still conscious cuz you

have more hit points than that but I

would like you're happy you're saving

throw oh sorry no I do not go twice I

detect whoa

there you go anyways yes beetus : I give

you go another four so I hit you in one

side of the temple ah then I jump to the

other side and page me in the other side

that simple electroshock therapy bro and

twelve and twelve points oh so you're

gonna take that much damage but roll

your saving throw again to see if you

can break the

oh hi let's go hey big you snap out of

it I saved you saved you what happened

don't mind the blood coming out of your

temples it was him he did it thank you

lady Rajan are sorry don't slack fiber

black Viper as the where rats bursts

into flames and withers before you into

a blackened mass of singed fur i I did

that I've been laughing at it thank you

a bunch of vampires come crashing in

through windows and land around you

there are three of these vampires spa

including one little orphan girl great

about why summers got to be an orphan

girl because it's tragic and this is a

gothic story oh you know what to do but

she looks all feral and she's got her

fangs out and she comes at you with two

of her kin her a Tolkien oh three coming

at me yeah because you're standing

closest to the windows that's one so

they come smashing through those windows

they hop down off the bookshelves in

your grille what do you do

dang it yeah alright I'm going to use my

cunning action to get behind you how you

doing there you go

and well no come to the side of him and

I'm going to try to fight them off okay

all three are coming at me I can attack

three times so I guess one each

sure all right do I have advantage you

do because the F is fighting by your

side I know so therefore I also a sneak

attack alright so that is 1/12 and that

isn't a lemon ooh and that's really a

lot that's 24

okay that was from one attack right yes

those were all the attacks and you're

okay so you hit the first one for 24 and

that one deals a grievous wound he's

still all those were to attack oh I'm so

hit separate attacks okay got it

um so which how many hit all oh hey okay

yeah these these vampires are not

wearing any kind of armor oh okay girl

alright so that is 18 19 20 21 but also

plus 14

so that's 35 right is that right someone

check my map that right I'm bad at that

okay so you badly wound one of them that

one's the girl oh hey that okay if you

want it's a little girl for 35 she goes

down oh you just rock very nice it

wasn't you this time we just dropped her

all right I can leave that's all I

wanted to do for this game I'm done all

right let's see 8 9 10 13 and then 5 9

13 14 15

okay so that that will carry over to the

next vampire I've Charlie after the

vampires a beer house Marg Astor's

guards start

come in and confront some of these

vampires that have infiltrated the

estate so you are not alone okay Aaron

now battle is playing out all over the

place vampires all over the place

exactly yes I try to apologize for the

room being burnt oh yeah sorry yeah

things are still smoking and smoldering

furnishings are kind of half on fire

like they're putting stuff out like put

my feather out in my colon what do you

do I'm still single-minded about strawed

so I'm just gonna keep attacking him

we're locked in a duel so first attack

will be ooh well no she she gets a

little overzealous flips backward a

little bit misses this time though it's

a 25 yeah and so I think she still has

quite a few of those divine smize left

so let's go okay the base damage is

gonna be 6 plus 5 is 11

Plus Boris 15

divine smite is 23 at the noise 31 weird

like ah words and Oh 40 to God

alright straat is crumbling leave a lot

of the later compels you and you realize

it has been so long since you have faced

strong and you have been through so much

in the interim that it is with some

surprise that you see him weaken before

you the way he does

you realize in an instant just all the

things that you and your friends have

gone through to steal you for this

moment for this showdown and realize for

the first time there there isn't fear in

his eyes because he is a creature of the

night

and here is beyond him in his present

state but more importantly there's no

fear in your eyes a tear welled up

beneath one's eyes just like yeah I love

you guys for a moment you almost take

pity on the devil straud no no no no

really you take pity on the devil stride

please go palton do it this is all you

buddy oh so I'm not feeling particularly

good with hitting with a story again

that was just dumb luck

but for flavor after I've liked taking

the sword out of him yes I just kind of

look at him as he's like like all

crumpled up by my evil ins just like

obnoxious amount of dice and it is kind

of like you've cursed people for long I

know

so we're gonna see how you like it and

I'm gonna my I kind of like veins

growing in it and the whites turn black

and glow yellow and I'm gonna try and

cast this tiny evil eye on them wisdom

that is okay

and I did that at fifth level so that is

going to be equivalent to duplicate the

effect of whole person so his help he's

just chillin there so he's just like

frozen mm-hmm okay just watching him

yeah all right and that was your action

right yeah

and then as my bonus action I'm going to

so everyone else is like in the other

room is only a super strut

Balthasar was actually over here

attacking me and Dragomir was over here

attacking him though they'd be in the

area too

okay well I have even come over yeah oh

man what's up hey haters I so for my

bonus action I will do a Bartok

inspiration on Evelyn I'm gonna sing her

a nice little song and it's an emotional

moment it is and then that gives her a

uh-1d ten on any ability check attack

role or saving throne

okay nice do ya yes what do you do okay

so now we're fighting vampire spawn yes

I really appreciate your help

all right yeah okay the child look at

that that kid I saw okay

all right so first thing I do is a get

rid of that and then I'll have the moon

splinter dagger now this thing that is a

magical weapon so I'll use that to fight

alongside her more particularly what I

want to ask about is I've seen this

fighting before you have yes it's a very

peculiar type of fighting especially

with where she's placing her blade yeah

i and you know that bleed is starting to

look a little fun huh

I think you piece together the puzzle

dear okay so yeah I'll do an attack rule

first grip on the dagger and just yeah I

try to get one in the chest just doing

attack role against that all right

I'll roll over here camera people there

is a wounded one a little girl I'm gonna

go after the young wounded one okay then

don't need the help so with advantage

just gonna be 27 27 yes all right great

then for sneak attack damage 11 14 17 21

23 plus the d4 from moon spinder 24 29

total 29 total yes okay that one is

badly wounded all right great

so he yeah like Pierce and that like

pull it out and I attention immediately

here and be like what the hell are you

doing I don't know what you mean

you're really bad at this estimate lane

you'll explain to yourself as soon as

we're done with this and they'll be much

all right yeah Strix after lighting the

place on fire there are some vampires

fighting guards well this is the perfect

time for spectral chicken so describe

what happens okay so I'm gonna catch

spectral chickens at six levels so these

monsters ghost is green chickens just

like come out of the ground or the car

and you start attacking all the vampires

this is a very serious game yeah and

there's silkie chickens cuz they're

really cute okay does everyone see we

all know it yeah so anyway alright these

rating and damage so sucks basically on

the bad guys turn they will start they

will that your kids will attack them yes

and they'll be doing a 68 radiant damage

Oh lovely six-month 868 radiant damages

radiant yeah yeah right here and I'm

just petting it

Balthasar what do you do on your turn

you have been freed from your brother

Bob from the vampire yes what is the

current status of strasse right now

Strada is buckling under the abuse

heaped upon him by the Paladin he Boleyn

and by the lightsaber wielding evil eye

bearing bard and you dealt him a quite a

blow and you can see that the radiant

damage he's taken is preventing him from

right I'd like to improvise a way to

capture him he is held right now so it's

really easy today like yeah he's just

frozen

yeah he just froze it you have a rope

don't they say capture yeah yeah yeah we

tried that yeah don't you that what

happened just kill him just guys look

I'm not gonna put a mess out of it at

all yes I mean no I wanna take him out

into the sunshine I mean yeah you can

live it's a dark and stormy night yeah

my eye doesn't last like but now let me

let me ask you that your brother this

CFS your expert vampire Anders you

probably would have accounted for

something I'm the expert he tries to

kill vampires with garlic steel yeah

yeah yeah yeah so would you can you

imagine anything that you would have on

you or brought with you that might

facilitate what it is you want to do

like basically capturing a vampire well

they're notorious silver SEC Oh

excellent

zipper exactly so I take my silver

shekels okay so you're gonna try to slap

those on me I'm gonna try to slap well

actually no it's like a silver breeze

like it goes around your weight like a

chastity belt so you're gonna live a

chaste I'm Belle beard

vampire straat you know look what is

vampire saying so like if you're gonna

try to clamp that on me while I'm still

fighting you're gonna have to make some

sort of attack well my friend all right

sneak attack but it would be like an

advantage because he's held right right

so you've got a nerve you're a rogue you

have your sneak attack bonus you roll

twice and take the higher result what

are y'all friend to do with him exactly

what a silver chest look we're gonna

take him out of here okay so you don't

have to deal with him anymore

yeah but the capacity belt I'm a

questioning it's silver he can't really

break out of it so it's not the material

check it out here at though me the

question it's a trade deal we found out

who killed the ghost okay we give you

that information and we leave with some

that still doesn't really answer the

question Lady Margaret

her incorporeal form having returned to

her secret sanctuary basically repents

or comes back into being we're in her

house what do you expect we are in her

house yeah yes well she could just move

she's around somewhere lady monster

somewhere and if she's not around that's

if not that's okay she's a ghost we

can't see her no spooky

nobody has chosen to leave the vampire

to his fate awesome so romance exactly

chastity belt roll baby

Stroud will call out for her to no avail

you make your attacker all's alright but

you get strong wow that was one

to get to okay I get to though it's all

good yeah - sorry what is it 3-3 yeah

that doesn't work you try to clap that

thing on me and I'm having none of it

he's literally like something I watch

you fail I'm just like dude come on man

look I'm not an inventor I'm a husband

okay setup for you it was so easy don't

rub it in how do you perhaps thought

that maybe this isn't really for you

anyway just bragging or your day or

something just see drawn something I'll

see what fits well look I'm gonna leave

this rest of this to my brother because

obviously over the head I'm a little

loopy right now I'm in chastity belt

didn't work so playing - so we just

finished them off baby you keep saying

that I know I know I know but should we

talk I'm going to attack so whilst I am

cowed before you - yes skulky Dragomir

here take my head off I'm smokin Prince

will I do it 5 + 10 huh man yeah that's

what's up well because the your held

yeah oh that's right yeah thank you did

he get advantage - he did he did but he

already had him so you had to make

another role yeah it's still because I'm

being magically held by what do you guys

even do we senators I mean really I

think you tain yeah yeah same here and I

still did something okay no I got him

out of my brother's brain yeah a little

bit there oh yes so happy I started this

whole thing off yeah come on now yeah

you did when you were able to

successfully hit with your brother

story of my life it's not over yet wait

hold on say that say that again really

quick say it say that again so you're

saying that the only one that you've

actually been able to successfully hit

was your brother

okay we are trying our best we have a

hard time this is the only thing open

well the vampire is held but he doesn't

have to do anything to try to lock his

gaze onto you

Alton yeah okay to try to get you to

break the hold over him make a wisdom

saving throw against his charm any eight

plus five okay you feel strong and I'm

radiating my business kayak and again

this is not a spell this is not a spell

but you do have evil ins plus five bonus

for her pounds net 20 it still happens

just like a few boss yeah it's real cute

so as I try to sway you

evylyn you can see in my plaintive gaze

trying to reach out to palton and you

have the next action I already quit dude

we're done you have a plot you have a

d-10 to whatever your next role is if

you so wish to use it you know normally

even would would not continue to fight

against something defenseless but Strada

is pure evil right yeah yes just about

as evil as it gets

family yeah she's looking around and

she's feeling the light of life and her

shining down on her and she's seeing all

her friends who have done so much to

help her and she says it's time and she

just takes a big swing at him even

without the +10 that's gonna be a 26 to

hit okay

[Music]

and we're gonna go for 7 plus 10 is 17

plus 4 is 21 okay I can add it to damage

mm-hm

no not defend to attacker all saving

throw yeah let's go my apologies 24 28

29 Oh your hair looks married all three

you're doing plenty of damage okay so

you bring your flaming blade and you

chop off strods head real and as his

head flies off his body

you see both the head and the body

turned to mist and just sort of hang

there as this green oily mist that's

normal right she does like a like a

prayer to levander in honor and the mist

seems to cohere into a vaguely

straw-like shape and you see it bear

claws and fangs at the empty hair but it

is still holding together as basically

this spectral misty form now kind of

making its way slowly away oh cool you

made us draw back to try to see if I can

do something to the mist yeah I mean

it's a magical weapon so at least just

try to slice through it you wave your

flaming sword through the mist yeah

absolutely

I got another attack role or mistake

[Music]

I'm trying to think magic yeah I know I

was thinking magic magic thinking magic

but I can't think of anything

yes our from home straw you have moved

him from his domain my moon my thing is

not radiant damage right or any of my

chickens in there I remember their

chicken yes I'll check I'll check hold

on D&D beyond what say yes ok ok yes DM

says yes all right so instead she cast

her flaming sword aside and cast

Moonbeam and calls down a pillar of

light in the middle of the mists there's

a chicken there too and she adds the

Bartok inspiration mm-hmm chicken

support and chickens any moral support

yeah the chickens are just like pecking

like eatin seeds but mainly the bar

ticks so 24 to hit with all right you

catch the misty form of straw in the

Moonbeam and this energy comes basically

from your faith right down from the

standard so we have already sort of said

it's more of a warning light

yeah right yeah yes the dawn the light

of the dogs were the Sun so you bring

the dawn down the pothole and in that

moment he is just obliterated there's

another one

yes you will be able to take the stories

of your conquest over the devil strata

cross the plains to every tavern and

fest hall as you come upon and they will

know that the brother is Dragomir and

Balthazar with a little help from the

waffle crew I would like to persuade

them they did nothing the world will

never know that it's our story now

yeah I'm can I - okay all right can the

chickens eat some of the straw dashes

yes the the as ashes rain down upon the

floor your spectral chickens just start

pecking ask them okay so persuading them

they didn't do anything that is a seven

plus okay

[Laughter]

it's like every guest NPC why are the

vampires still in here with us

so yeah vampires that remain many of

them fighting guards and whatnot shrivel

and die good

you I did it I got the little one

question can I roll to persuade them

that we did everything

oh well I guess all's fair the tables

have turned I'm gonna kick vampires good

luck with my aura oh that's a four okay

yeah that's good all around someone else

family over performance can I make the

rules yeah there we go

well they can we just agree to disagree

that well we might depending on what the

number is oh yeah

you guys aren't gonna really influence

each other because your parents I mean

as a 19 though that's really strong hmm

so they make a good case ball yeah you

know what I don't care let's say well

yeah it's a good job you know a thumbs

up we did this together right so there's

all sorts of craziness going on the

marketers say because of course you guys

started a fight on Sauron to wrap up how

would you like to make your exits I

think for the moment evylyn is kind of

like she's just called down the light of

Lysander and obliterated the most

terrifying enemy that they had the party

had known so I think she's kind of like

overwhelmed I think she's maybe standing

there having like said a prayer to

Lysander but almost like maybe tears are

running down her face I think she's just

kind of stunned I think she's not moving

okay and is there any bearing on the

fact that we started the fight and they

just fought because the fight had

started with that that's right

yeah we take the brunt you you on that

so I like so there Shadid from yes and

you probably have like a little vial or

something where you can sweep up some of

the vampires at huh so that you have

proof that say the vampires the - I was

gonna say so you were there perfect bad

yeah

you guys hold no bearing on starting a

fight on this night for it was us who

did everything

everything okay so I'll be taking the

ashes as a reward for our efforts should

you require their monster-hunting

services and a few debtor here's the

card if you do what I tell people that

you did have a hand in this then you can

take part of the punishment for starting

to fight tonight Wow

I'll be sure that tomorrow over tea I

will definitely be telling everybody

that the black Viper came in and

definitely did all of the attack unit

and all of the winning who is that come

in yes fillet everyone oh hi oh right

you look exactly the same mask mask it's

like it's a I'm sorry

so do we do we need to like leave

without getting in trouble

yeah you also promised this nation you

can go back to the party yeah great

people and we're still in the middle of

a murder mystery party if you forgot and

if I recall Bob Lazar said you had

information on who the murderer was

you promised that to us this is true but

that was in exchange for letting us take

him hostage which didn't happen so we

gotta go that's kind of your fault

though how so how we you said that we

couldn't hit anybody but our brothers

yeah first of all the person who like I

forgot was even here said that second of

all it was literally on the ground

immobile ready to be shackled actually

what needs the most dangerous though

exactly Thanks and and professional

hunters know that yes when our animal

was wounded back against the corner that

is when they fight the hardest dude
