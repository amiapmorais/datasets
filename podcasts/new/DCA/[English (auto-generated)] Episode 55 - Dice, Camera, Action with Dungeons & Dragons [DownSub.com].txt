you

[Laughter]

everybody Wow

and welcome back Sam hey happy to be

here all right

so just to bring everybody up to speed a

little preamble many years ago a

powerful wizard was drawn into the

domain of burrow via and like so many

adventurers before and after him unable

to escape but so great was this wizard

and his magic that he persuaded a number

of the Burrow vien people to rise up and

revolt against their Dark Lord in a bid

to gain his freedom and led these

hapless souls to Castle Ravenloft and a

showdown with its Dark Master strawed as

the wizard sent the Burrow viens off to

die at the hands of strods dragon shaped

gargoyles and minions the wizard locked

in battle with the vampire and they

fought in the courtyard and they fought

on the walls and they fought past the

gates to the tops of the mountains and

there two four headed to the top of a

great waterfall and thought and thought

and thought and strawed sent his bat

sent his wolves and his other minions at

this wizard until finally the wizard was

defeated and thrown from the top of the

waterfall where he presumably fell to

his death and yet he lived and

sequestered himself in the darker

corners of burrow via locked away in a

magical mansion away from the prying

eyes of the Dark Lord straud and slowly

went mad only to come forth once more to

the aid of a group of adventurers

calling themselves the waffle crew and

while they confronted Stroud in the

depths of Castle Ravenloft this wizard

Morton Kynan headed up into the spires

of Ravenloft and

destroyed the heart of sorrow with his

magic this pulsating glimmering

crystalline heart that gave the Dark

Lord of Ravenloft powers far greater

than a normal vampire Lord and then from

there went down into the study of the

vampire Lord found his stolen spell book

and quickly departed not knowing and not

really caring about the fate of the

adventurer as he had left in the

catacombs who were fortunate enough to

have with them of astana doll into which

they trapped straud and they bore him

out of burrow via not realizing that a

fragment of straud had been left behind

in the disembodied shadow of paltin the

bard that shadow brought the waffle crew

back into burrow via for one reason and

one reason alone to see palton cast off

the light embrace the darkness and wed

the dark powers thereby ensuring burrow

vias damnation ensuring that it could

reunite with paltin once again shadow

and man as one and in order to do this

paltin would have to let go of many

things including his friends for until

then the shadow would continually bring

them back and there would be no hope of

escape for them ever and when we last

left paltin he was being berated by the

abbot of Kris who has come to the castle

to perform the wedding and to deliver

the bride you stirred the Abbott's anger

paltin when you cast a suggestion spell

on him not realizing that his celestial

heritage rendered him immune and as he

spread his angelic wings and summoned to

his hand a golden mace with which to

smite you it seemed like you would be

smote and that's where we left off last

session with your friends perched on the

roof of the chapel overhead peering down

on you although

you do not know that they're there the

abbot regains his composure you see the

anger in his eyes paltin his sort of

golden glimmering eyes disappear and

sort of a look of embarrassment on his

face like how dare he threatened to

strike one of your one such as you

oh I just smashed a control panel and he

says forgive me I wish you no harm the

dark powers and as he says that he kind

of steps down off the a couple steps

down away from the black altar behind

him to kind of rest an arm a comforting

hand on your shoulder and he says they

speak to me they inspired me to create a

bride for the rightful Lord of this land

I thought they wanted her first rod but

I was mistaken

I made her myself

from the most beautiful women of burrow

via

I and he says the dark powers will turn

my beloved daughter into flesh and blood

as their wedding gift to you

her life is in your hands

no pressure he says while this is going

on and DF Strix and evylyn from your

perch on the roof of the chapel looking

through one of its cracked windows you

can hear the abbot's voice ringing clear

through the the chapel and the two of

them are very close physically now you

can see below you there's also a vampire

spawn that you know named Doru who's the

altar boy he's standing a few paces

behind the abbot near the altar looking

kind of awkward and timid in posture

there's also a balcony that overlooks

the chapel that you can see clearly and

as you recall a hulking shadow of Strix

is brother Isaac the half fiend can be

seen on that balcony

the only other figures in the chapel now

that the witches of all left are a

couple zombie guards along the perimeter

but nothing nothing too great it is at

that time that the three of you need to

make perception checks 1618 I can see

through my tears none of you are

surprised now outside it's it's gotten

darker the Sun has set behind the

distant mountains and a storm is rolling

in but over the sound of the Rolling

Thunder and the wind the cold wind

blowing over you you hear the soft

of wings and landing on the rooftop not

too far from you and you're not

surprised by it is a crow or Raven and

it kind of stares at you with its black

eyes for an instant and then instantly

transforms into a naked boy maybe 9 or

10 years old crouched down very pallid

pale flesh and dark curly hair and dark

black eyes and he is smiling wickedly at

you I like put the snacks that I had

just was getting out for the Raven and

put him back in my robe

creepy little boy yes and you plans I'm

like Falcon you've seen creature you've

seen at least one creature like this

this is a where Raven the last we're

living you know died and the boy while

still smiling at you holds up a finger

goes and then say

I look at I look at Strix who is the

only person that I would think would

know something about a wizard coming and

kind of just look quizzically at her we

just like across the void just keep and

then the little boy says Marty Carty

gasps very loudly like you know he said

she's been trying to whisper but she's

very excited to hear about paltin make a

perception check oh boy

that is a powerful powerful five okay

you do not hear yeah you do not hear

evil ins gasp and actually neither does

the abbot the fake God but you you can

see over the abbot shoulder palton that

door ooh heard something because he

cranes his head up to the ceiling and

just starts staring up at the roof with

his bloodshot eyes while he's doing that

you can see that the abbot is strongly

suggesting that you prepare your vows

and getting dressed for the wedding

because the guests are on their way

mm-hmm so do I notice do I knows him

looking up like look at around you see

door ooh looking up at something like

sudden suddenly some noise or something

caught his attention but yeah I feel you

don't see what it is and you don't think

anything okay all right well vows suit

up

let's let's have a wedding all right now

you recall that assure the strods

vampire spawn led you here but then he

left at the abbot's command so the abbot

sort of will usher you down the aisle

back to the doors of the chapel

when the doors open you see that usher

is not waiting outside like you expected

and I say that only because while you

are talking with the abbot well I sure

was out in the hall he saw eASIC Straz

knee and directed him up to the balcony

then headed off into the bowels of the

castle his purple waistcoat tightly

bound around him his ruffled shirt neat

and proper and he enters through a

secret door and there is a circular room

choked with webs so much so that any

natural light that could possibly

penetrate this room has been all but

snuffed out but with his vampire eyes he

can see perfectly in the darkness and

therein lies a coffin lying on the

middle of the floor he walks over and

touches his boot to a pedal built into

the foot of the coffin and pressing it

causes the lid to split in the middle

and snap open revealing that his coffin

contains a rotted maggot ridden corpse

and as assure Niels our sorry sits down

on the edge of the coffin he reaches for

the hand the right hand of the corpse

and actually lifts it and caresses his

face with it as maggots fall from falls

in the flesh

and then the car pulling a little too

hard he actually rips the arm off the

rotted corpse that seems completely

untroubled by this and just presses the

palm of the rotted arm up into his face

and kisses it and says to the maggot

ridden remains of Falken a revenge will

be ours so soon

Paulding I don't think you stick your

dick and crazy I'm sorry

wait we see this nope nobody sees this

what paltin sees is sure that's what I

thought okay you're essentially seeing

something you couldn't possibly know

about gotcha but what you see paltin is

a light coming down the hallway and it's

your mongrel folk servant

Cyrus Bellevue he's not a lantern and he

seems to come right up to you and is

going to take you back to your room so

that you can get properly outfitted so

if you'll follow him he'll lead you

where you need to go sure let's go okay

you're able to get back to your master

suite

there is your tailored wedding suit

ready for you it's been cleaned as best

as possible considering it was basically

dug out of some probably taken off some

corpse somewhere and it's it's laid out

you can see that in a couple witches

burrow vien witches come into the room

and they help you get into your suit and

one of them pulls out a set of shears

and the other one pulls out a shawl a

crimson shawl to drape over your

shoulders while they trim your hair

and once you are dressed and neatly

trimmed the witches with their brooms

sweep up the hairs in gather them up and

take all their paraphernalia out and

leave you there the mongrel folk doesn't

leave until Asher shows up and when

Asher sees you he practically weeps you

are sight breathe it in and then shoes

away Cyrus get out get out

and Cyrus mumbles something about making

sure the wedding cake is ready and then

you don't see him again for a while

Asher will come over to you you've

noticed that there's a although he

douses himself in perfume there is a

thicker stench of decay on him than when

last you were together and he he sort of

straightens up just a couple little

frills and things and he sort of brushes

his hand in your hair and takes a couple

little pieces of hair that the witches

missed off your lip Elle and I want to

like as he's doing now I like grab his

hand okay you see his thin gaunt

pale hand and his long nails and yeah it

it looks it smells like he was holding

like a dead rat for about ten minutes in

that hand soap would add make another

perception check to see if you detect

[Laughter]

well I guess you'll never know now I

believe you do have inspiration you

gained that last time for turning kind

of

over to your side and getting him to

divulge information he shouldn't have

okay I would like to use that actually

all right

second 1:18 okay much better okay so yes

you think that he has been in direct

prolonged contact with dead flesh hmm

with your 18 you voice words you can

sense a sort of familiar aroma

you can't quite peg where you last

smelled it but he's definitely got

someone else's stink hanging on him and

the other thing that you can see with

your 18 is that while he has been sort

of straightening you up and cleaning up

a figure has appeared in the open

doorway behind him and he hasn't noticed

that figure is in a white wedding gown

and stands 6 feet tall is perfectly

still like a statue with its arms

slightly out from its sides and there is

a veil so thick over her head that you

can't see her features at all and she's

just standing there like a ghost I mean

while you're sniffing Escher his hand

and kind of hang over the hand at this

bride in the doorway look as I'm like

smelling his hand like I I see her there

and I just kind of like like just kind

of like push him off okay that's like I

have an idea if you might be at that

point in time

I sure looks over his shoulder at what

you're talking to or who you're talking

to and if it's possible he becomes even

more pale and he gasps and immediately

makes his way over to her and says where

are your bridesmaids

and the bride bride goes from under the

veil and Asher says this is not the good

luck

you must golf and he begins to he sort

of grabs hold of her and he it's like

trying to move he's like trying to move

a statue at first she just doesn't move

and Asher looks back at you embarrassed

and he says I don't know what's what's

wrong the bridesmaids are supposed to

tend to her say oh the bridesmaids

that's what's wrong okay and that extra

sort of pushes her out in the doorway a

little bit enough so that he can close

the doors and he turns to and he says I

will return as soon as I can

to gather you for the procession stay

here I need to take her back to her bed

chambers okay and then he pulls the door

shut and now you find yourself at least

momentarily alone you sort of cast your

eyes over to a full-length freestanding

mirror where you can see yourself

dressed for the first time you look

pretty snazzy um I'll be at your garb is

somewhat archaic hmm it's like okay okay

got your vows figured out I got

everything figured out I am ready

excellent what do I do well while you're

thinking about that let's find out what

they rest of the waffle crew on the roof

of the chapel wants to do that try that

naked child where Raven is still on the

rooftop he told you wait for murti Kirti

as soon as Paulson starts leaving even

just like makes to follow Oh kind of

motions everyone to follow her is your

intention to go down into the chapel

where you can be seen or to follow

outside the castle essentially go back

to where you think he might go well I

guess I say to the crew like come on we

have to follow him he's coming back here

like Prince wait here well he probably

doesn't want to actually come back here

he probably doesn't want to actually go

through well I'm not going actually back

in that castle I'm staying actually

right here I said I don't think that he

actually wants to go back here don't

actually listen to her she's actually

crazy you guys figure it out I cast a

mage armor on myself because as a

pre-emptive fear reaction okay I was

damn kind of crouches like that and like

says you guys figure it out I grabbed

him by the shoulders I'm like yep what

is wrong with you we need you right now

as easy still there you can still see

him haunting the balcony overlooking the

chapter chapel trying not to be seen

he's in the shadows does he see us no oh

thank god

and at this very moment he seems

somewhat impatient it's at that point in

time when the castle belfry rings out

big loud bells and chimes sound above

you because the belfry is rate above the

chapel spatially and with the ringing of

the bells you can hear the doors to the

chapel below throw open and a procession

of ghosts begin to move into the into

the chapel and these ghosts look like

the sort of spectral remains of the

buried dead in finery and in some cases

in what appeared to be Armour and

adventuring garb do we recognize any of

them oh no

no oh they're just vestiges of what we

could have been okay it's sort of that's

sort of the impression you get is this

could be the remains of those who have

who died not only dead burro viens

raised to attend the wedding by the

bagpipe sound that you heard but also

the spirits of dead adventurers over the

years who perished here trying to escape

basically all of all of the the Damned

have been invited to this blessed event

I take deaths face and I point it

towards the ghost and I said look what's

going out here

what what do I do I think we should

silently stay still like the nice bird

voices but I agree with him bird boy

what do you want and you see he just

sort of tilts his head up looks around

at the air the sky the brewing clouds

the the distant rumble of thunder and

then he when you start yelling at him he

sort of turns to you and just says you

never do it once even

peoplein gets really really close to the

bird boy and goes what do what he says

Marty Garrett he's coming when is he

coming so we're kind of busy he says and

the rest of the flock to walk of what he

says

the real ravens obviously evil and

obviously there were murders that a

murder I don't know are we gonna be

murdered

maybe a little from column a little call

me and the the bird boy tells you that

he has come here on behalf of her win'

Marta cough yes you know at her when

Marta cough was the proprietor of an inn

in the town of Allah key

we got his wine yes absolutely you did

what what businesses you wouldn't have

with us now because we obviously never

starts just like lies down on the ground

and the kid says we're all on the same

side yes look that's fine I'm really

happy to see our friend Marie Kirti

again he says very nice

Marty cardis gonna free us from

damnation great I hate damnation love

being free awesome right now I don't

know if he's mentally stable enough for

that but you know I'll keep my hopes

high we just supposed to I'm looking at

like death crunched on the floor and the

Strix laying on the ground like staring

at the sky are we just supposed to sit

here what where are my friends where am

i mister don't you remember at this

point in time crawling up to the window

oh come on door is the vampire altar boy

door rue you can see you must have just

like start to walk like a spider to hear

what the hell is going on outside and he

pokes his bloodshot eyes and face out

through the window and looks

you evylyn and is surprised and

horrified when he sees the three of you

on the roof because the last time he got

you you accosted him and paste him out

of church and that's screaming off into

the night

so the sound of Evelyn's voice brought

back brings back some instant and and

seeing you brings back some horrible

horrible memories strangely no there's a

there in his sort of bloodshot eyes you

can see there's all kinds of things

going through his head like should he

run back down and tell the aperture here

should he attack you

he doesn't care about new evil and

you're not alive but he does seem to his

eyes are drawn somewhat to Strix and

deaath and the warm blood pumping

through their veins trying to approach

him slowly like like a stray dog okay

and he says you're here to save your

friend aren't you

we have so so many friends advancing

toward him very carefully the one that

the abbot plans to marry off oh the

abbot's getting married that's so that's

so sweet

I'm like try I'm like oh let's to get

close up to him to like Holliman yeah

you can make that attempt right now if

you want okay make a make a strength

athletics check oh it is an a20 oh all

right although he's stronger than he

looks you are able to pull him through

the window out onto the roof I just like

pulling and grabbing like around the

face and I'm holding him like this

alright

small as you are you are able to do that

using your crazy robot strength yeah

the words and places and as I'm holding

him like the stress just sounds like a

woo like a word every time he tries to

get away oh my god

and I'm looking at strict Cynthia then

like you see what's going on what am i

doing this one

do you wait a polymorph am happy nice

alright just complain you know daaru

shakes his head

well course he shakes his I mean well

maybe maybe he's not evil anymore let me

check I check it easy umm yeah Dora is

still evil you sense totally evil Undead

'no scumming from him yeah still totally

evil and undead so polymorph great idea

something cute please i'll polymorph him

into a bat finger then that'll just

that'll be the thing that blends in the

most

all right you cast the spell and he

turns into a bat yes you've lame I hold

on to the bat I mean I'm actually gonna

leave a nice bag I'm gonna have you make

an attack role to gravity sorry not an

attack role a strength extract to grab

him 22 okay you succeed as he turns into

a bat

he sort of flaps a couple times before

you grab him hey but do you have like a

like a thing you can open up and like

put things in ah maybe like a you know

like juice bars in there already or just

a pouch that we could tie up and throw

off the roof that makes more sense I'm

sure I'll just take a piece of my robe

and make it into a little pouch alright

it starts to rain so you have it's not I

didn't you know I'll put him on my

person you stuck in a Battier pouch done

I'd great carry it then let someone else

find him and turn him not into about

just put him off the roof no he's gonna

stay on my person as the rain begins to

fall the chimes and the belfry cease and

you can see there are a number

spectral figures in the chapel below

paltin you can hear the rain falling on

the roof tiles above you yeah there are

big double doors leading out of the

bedchamber as well as a large window

that's covered with drapes and the room

is lit by candles in candle sticks and

there are shadows all over the place one

of them you recognize as your own it's

detached from you however in many ways

yes okay I'm chilling okay

s-sure returns to lead you to the chapel

well what now and he grabs you and sort

of pulls you along hastily like time is

short and there's a sense of urgency on

in his facial and his in his village and

in his pace can I like like pull my hand

yeah like abruptly off just like Sarah

is there a reason he says no everything

is fine I promise you do I believe him

make an inside check okay I probably

believe him that would be a six okay um

let's just say you're not sure you

believe him or not he's not giving much

away but you obviously have doubts

hmm

he's he's kind of tipping his hand there

you do get the sense even with your six

that's something is he's worried about

something something has changed since

the last time you saw him

I'm gonna I'm gonna tell him I'm like

we'll go we'll go at the pace alright so

you sort of walk slowly and deliberately

no and as you do and he's walking beside

you almost like the shadow that you lost

you can see that he is looking around in

the corners of the castle and listening

something is making him very very

worried and I'm still in case you forgot

you still have your severed hand

following you around your disembodied

shriveled black member but you know that

you inherited that's still clinging to

you somewhere ok can I can try and

persuade him to just tell me let's go

what's going on

you sure can go ahead and make a

persuasion check while you're well while

you're walking to your wedding that

would be a 23 all right

once again you were able to pry

information out of him that he is

reluctant to give he tells you that he

couldn't find the bridesmaids a vampire

spawn who basically were charged with

Ludmilla honest Razia and Valenta their

names are and they were supposed to look

after the bride they're missing and he

can't help but feel there's someone here

that that someone might try to ruin all

of our glorious plans

and he says but don't let that trouble

you you have to marry it is the only way

we can be together what so so what if

the bridesmaids aren't there is the

whole thing off no he trusted he

entrusted the bride to strods witches

and so she'll be there he's just worried

that there is danger presence he can

smell danger on the air it's like oh

speaking of smell I never I never asked

pretty dank right now dude what's going

on cut to scene where he leads you to a

chamber in in the castle and you can see

there's a secret door that he opens that

leads to this chamber that's full of

thick webs and you can hear the sound of

the Thunder and the rain through open

windows near the high top of this

chamber it looks like you're in a belfry

up nestled among the the webs in a flash

of lightning you can see a great Bell on

the floor underneath the Bell is a

coffin a beautiful sort of redwood

coffin with Usher's name in it and it's

open and inside you can see the rotted

desiccated corpse of Falcon the and I'm

and your suitor standing next assure as

he shows you the corpse of his dead

former wear Raven lover a look at and

lightning flashes briefly allowing just

enough like light to fall onto Falcons

corpse to see that in its present

decayed state it's barely recognizable

it's the basically the naked broken body

of falcon as you last saw him when you

both fell off of the out of the castle

onto the courtyard

yes when we both fell yes sure leans

over to you and takes your hand and says

I don't blame you for his death oh thank

god

I blame straud for turning me into this

and tearing me away from him oh I don't

want that to happen with us that is why

you will take this bride you will marry

her you will take the gift that the dark

powers offer you and then before strods

shadow can reunite with you we will

destroy it together using that shiny

sword of yours it's the only thing that

can hurt him it's not the worst thing

I've ever heard you don't know how happy

it makes me to hear you say that the

road to Raven we have a wedding to

attend

oh gosh your absence would be noted

my wad now your absence would be noted

he says you wouldn't want to make the

abbot angry mm-hmm so then should we go

now would be a good time yes I'll go get

married fam all right after you stuff

the bat in the pouch and the rain begins

to fall down upon you is there anything

that the three of you want to do paltin

has been gone for some number of minutes

now is there any way that my spell could

reach music on the balcony to try and

polymorph him to let me check the ring

what's the range of the spell you check

that oh yeah see how far away is this

from you don't want anything to do with

him oh now you know if you cast the

spell and it fails 60 feet okay well I

have I have two things I'd like you to

whatever fails no yeah no from ill no

all right yeah so he's about from your

vantage point about 30 40 feet away

great okay so first thing I'm gonna do

is alter myself to look like straw that

causes the the little where Raven boy's

eyes to kind of bulge it was like I'm

going to try and polymorphic all right

the as you begin to cast the spell the

where Raven turns to you death and says

stop says what stop it's not time

I hear him say that she'll ruin

everything

actually yeah slightly smelly like kind

of disheveled Scott is tackle okay just

for giggles I'd like you both to make

dexterity savings because you are on

this sort of domed roof of this old old

old chapel it's kind of falling yes

please don't forget your ring too by the

way

oh yeah yeah 15 I got a 12 okay so as

you tackle her estrade in quotes kind of

tumbles a little bit and kind of doesn't

fall off the roof but tumbles off the

dome part and kind of is now clutching

by long fingers

the the eaves and gargoyles that are

sort of clinging to the edge of the dome

[Laughter]

regret my actions and then make way to

I'll just misty step back towards you oh

no you think you can probably with some

help just pull yourself okay okay then

you didn't fail

nearly bad entire to watch yourself in a

dire situation all right all right

and you regain your solid footing okay

great

at least I know is aquo n-- trek ignite

me with young everything bad happens so

I've taken all my precautions dance what

is wrong with you I think we should

listen to the bat he just tackled me so

I'm guessing we have to listen why don't

we just wait palton enters the chapel

with his best men assure by his side and

usher leads him down the aisle to the

black draped altar where the abbot

stands alone is there like a wedding

march like is it happening it's all very

quiet right now the ghosts watching

solemn silence as paltin has led to the

altar and then as

he stands there and kind of looks around

the abbot says words of welcome to the

congregation and then pipe organ music

begins playing throughout the castle oh

no we're running and you hear the bridal

March I look at death and strikes and

I'm like he he must have a plan

we just good plan and he's just waiting

till the opportune moment right yeah I'm

just like it is this the rehearsal and

coming into the doorway paltin of the

coldest aim doorway through which you

just entered you can see a bride the

same one that was standing in the

doorway there are two she's holding her

train and she walks in carrying a in her

hands dead roses I turn to the ethics

I'm like he he wouldn't marry and and

have the dark powers coming to his you

know his soul and he would never he's

not he's not evil he wouldn't strict you

feel you can feel the bat flapping madly

in your pouch tied you off just hold it

it's a starting to not feel like a

rehearsal and a sure Melina and say

there's no rehearsal ah was not aware

actually you know what I'm gonna take

the bat out and in a mage hand and just

like just holding it they're just like

yeah just totally thrashing I wanted to

really deal with that

like I leaned over - sure I'm just like

so so so that plan is gonna work right

you're not you're not you're not you're

not lying to me he says

if you have the Sun sword I have the son

of the Sun sword right I didn't give

that away can I like perceive it fight

feel like he's lying go ahead and make

another insight check okay all this time

evylyn is like she's kind of she's on

the roof and she's just like one step

closer like one step closer as this

seems to be progressing she's like more

and more at the tip of the roof that's a

that's a 10

okay you can't tell but nobody has none

of you have to make a perception check

to hear what sounds like from somewhere

deep in the castle screams explosions

and reverberations of things falling and

collapsing this is over the sound of the

music that wasn't us this time oh wait I

hear this - yeah

yes you do we know we're sure again I'm

like this part of it and he just ok cool

cuz it didn't feel like part of it but

I'm like not super from alright cool

thank you

alright the bride comes up to stand next

to you and the abbot begins to recite an

ancient ritual and based on the nature

of this it it sounds as much like a

spell as just a casual like normal

wedding ritual he is actually invoking

magic are we not gonna address the the

happenings happening nobody seems to

acknowledge it but you at this point and

a dark shadow appears on the wall of the

chapel behind the altar as though

presiding over everything

even above and behind the abbot and you

recognize it as the shadow of you but

wearing strods voluminous black cloak

it's joltin it's Stratton yes to evylyn

does this look like he is going through

like does she perceive that a spell is

being cast on balton or is he still the

spell is being cast and when paul you

believe that based on your actually make

a religion check to get the ins and outs

on this religion excellent you believe

that this is a powerful spell of magical

binding to be consummated with this

wedding and that once palton says his

vows he will essentially forsake who he

was and marry this bride this

representation of darkness and the power

that the dark powers have over this land

okay so I so the bound about the vows

are the completion of the spell so I am

holding action until I even slightly

perceived that paltin is about to like

move or speak okay

what's everybody else doing well the

mage hands still holding the bat I guess

I guess once the explosions start

happening I'll just have it like set it

down on the ground outside and just okay

I don't want to hurt it I just wanna

like get rid of it and and we're hearing

the explosion so obviously like bad

things are going to happen so yes I'm

just going to make sure to stand here

and our we're close together right

you are the three of us yes okay you see

the bat fly back up to you Oh smash

itself into the roof just like and then

as it does it turns back into the

vampire essentially I had enough damage

to itself Cerises facepalm so hard like

just like everything crawl curls into a

ball on the ground asteroids

and Doru says light and darkness are

forever betrothed whatever and he looks

at you evil and looks down at the bride

then it works it sorry yes door who

looks at you evil and looks down at the

bride looks at you like you're kind of

the same oh no you didn't and he says if

if you cast off the light and you read

darkness the dark powers may see fit to

restore you to flesh and blood what now

he does this to me on the roof yeah does

do other people notice he's talking to

me

oh yeah yeah that's their feel like

Scott's now yeah door ooh no not the

chapel below this is Dora this is Dora

the vampire the vampire spawn that strix

turned into a bat he's not he's back

with you on the roof okay

no your death impression he doesn't want

to be in the chapel any more than you do

okay excuse me what now

he says light and darkness are forever

betrothed if you cast off the light and

wed darkness the dark powers may see fit

to restore you to flesh and blood why on

earth would I want to be flesh and blood

if the darkness is inside me away with

you fell may the light of the theaters

to might you he doesn't like that you

see him royal and as you start yelling

about life and make another perception

check that would be in nineteen over the

sound over the sound of the Thunder you

can hear evil and yelling on the roof

not yellow and it's at that point in

time when the closed doors of the chapel

blast open and a mob of burro viens with

torches and pitchforks spill forth into

the chapel leading the way is Mark

Cawley animage not dead people the

brother of arena see that I immediately

am not strong anymore you can see his

mark has his like the borough viens with

him abrasions and wounds like they've

just been in a fight is Marquez cup is

covered with bite marks and he's very

pale and he's bleeding from wounds but

he clutches a bloody sword in one hand

and three severed women's heads by the

hair in the other and throws them down

on to the floor and they go tumbling

onto the carpet okay I lean over that

sure again this is not part of it he

shakes his head he sort of puts a sort

of a reassuring claw hand on your arm

just sort of tightening hold like he

doesn't want to become separated from

you don't touch me behind this wave of

borough viens strides in a familiar

figure a wizard that you knew who helped

you come this far you recognize it as of

course Morton Kainan how many of these

borough viens are tied together with

ropes that are currently and they are

armed a lot of them are armed with

10-foot poles and while that happens

outside on the roof you see

several ravens begin to fly and flutter

around you Holly as you dispel your

illusion as you banish Dora to the

darkness yes go ahead um the Ravens and

tell me if I'm wrong Kris because I can

be wrong but the Ravens some of them are

carrying flasks of oil yes many of them

are carrying replace some of them big

wine skins and they are flapping all

around the roof and they begin to pour

into the chapel through the cracked

windows and are now fluttering around in

the ceiling of the chapel and I'd like

everybody to roll initiative okay so

what does that amount to even when all

said and done 2022 palton nine nine

Strix I rolled a one yeah okay and Morty

Coony

rolled a four so that's a six all right

and done okay so and I was too busy

talking to the Ravens so the first

person to act is evylyn so we're Ravens

fluttering into pouring into the chapel

from the skies above and you can see

chaos below as burro viens have broken

in with Morton Keenan behind them man

I rolled that twenty I was so excited

now I'm not exactly sure that's why I'm

kind of glad I rolled though yeah I

think I think what even does is because

she was like in that stance already and

she was waiting for this moment to see

whether paulten was going to speak or

not kind of the way that like

a sound just like trigger someone mm-hmm

she I think she just like flying boots

tackles paulten I think she does as soon

as this as soon as the sound like she's

like poised and ready as soon as she

hears the sound it's just like alright

so you've basically fly down into the

chapel and try to tackle paltin there

yeah like blow em right off the altar

like tackle alright great

this is probably gonna catch paltin by

surprise but I'd like its lucky to make

an attack against paltin okay we're all

this tackling each other today yeah

actually palton because you heard evil

and you would actually see her

descending down toward you so if you

want if you want I can she can forego

the role if you're willing to let her

tackle you sure all right so she

literally falls on top of you and drives

you to the floor okay okay now scream

alright unless you want to use a bonus

action we'll say that I think I just I

say something to like speak now or

forever hold your peace were you going

to give yourself over to the dark powers

[Laughter]

all right with that silence the next to

act is the abbot who affronted by this

looks down at you evylyn and with some

surprise because the last time he saw

you you were flesh and blood now you

look like some sort of animated toy

version of yourself and then that mighty

mace will appear in his hand and he will

strike you with it yep his first swing

at you is only a 13 yeah

and so glance it off with the brush of

my bracer when he comes at you with the

backswing he rolls a twenty that he does

seven points of bludgeoning damage and

eighteen points of radiant damage for a

key for a total of 25 points of damage

to you it's fine and after trying to and

he tries to sort of smack you off of

paltin but that doesn't really work and

so next up is DF I crouched into

position to wash

evylyn as she like tackles Paulsen and

get attacked by the Abbott and then wait

just wait there okay

all right next up is Asher Asher is

going to try to pull palton out from

under away from evil and essentially so

evil and I'd like you to make a strength

athletics check opposed by Escher's

check guys me pulling from both okay he

rips palton away from you even screams

wildly and just sort of push pushes you

off him with his foot while he does that

and also paltin if you allow him he'll

help you get back to your feet sure all

right like I say in any of this

[Laughter]

Morton Canaan you can decide it on your

turn what you would like both of the

borough viens to do and the way Ravens

before you act okay okay

[Laughter]

what poles come up but there's also all

manner of strange pole arms that you've

never seen before some really obscure

looking weapons you really like you kind

of and every one of them is different

and you you realize wow everyone who

probably has their own statistics and

that's a nightmare commanding the where

Ravens that are holding a flash of oil

to drop them on the on the the attended

guests ghosts and such yep and and then

I and then he holds up his hand it goes

big me get me strength

he then addresses the groom as he casts

big bodies hand juiced up to level nine

[Music]

and addresses the groom says as this

giant hand appears but robbery and

family law does not favor the groom he

reaches over with Big B's hands and

attempts to grasp okay the bride and

grab her lift her up and and smusher

fire all right yes so use the hand

strength score to resolve the grapple

great

it's a juice to level nine yeah do I

need to make my nose up it's damaged by

quite a bit just go ahead and make a

spell casting it let's see it has a

strength of twenty six so it gets a plus

eight on its strength check so make that

strength check to grab it okay grab the

bride oh this is happening Paul and just

like oh no my breath no poor oh dear

thus for alright so your hand moves to

grab the bride but she forcefully prized

its fingers open falls from its grasp

good could you big bees gently lift the

veil

pigby always had Butterfinger yes and as

as her as her veil is sort of ripped her

veil is sort of ripped away and she

turns to you paltin and looked at the

congregation you see that her

it looks like the flesh golem that you

saw the abbot made back at the Abbey

this sort of kind of beautiful cobbled

out of various women's body parts figure

quite a lovely girl and her stitches

were very well masked and whatnot but at

some point the abbot decided to slice

off her head discard it and put the head

of arena cole jana on its

shoulders and that head is locked in the

same scream she had on her face when

strips when Strix knocked her off of

strods mount and dropped her to her

death that look of horror and surprise

shock that death gasp is just sort of

frozen on her face no all right and

that's Morty's spell so so the oil flax

then begin to explode throughout the

chamber lighting all of the brittle

wooden pews of flame and the ghosts find

themselves just engulfed in this fiery

Inferno several of the flasks also fall

on top of the cloth covered altar and

set that ablaze as well

two of the - of the flasks break on to

the abbot and kind of douse him with oil

but he hasn't caught fire yet and then

the Burrow viens go sort of hacking

through the ghosts with their

and affecting them not that's gonna work

his mark sees his dead sister's head on

this abominations body and just gasps in

horror almost he actually drops his

sword with a clatter onto the floor when

he sees her then bends down picks it up

tightens his grip and comes charging

down the aisle toward her saw her raised

and it will take all of his movement to

get to her all right and that brings us

to now DF dropped out of initiative

Asher's gun Morty's done paltin and the

abbot shouts say your vows so to recap

I'm going to go invisible and hide all

right now Asher had a grip on you so if

you want to worm out of it making a

dexterity acrobatics check or a strength

athletics check to break his grip is a

16 you are successful you tear free of

him disappear and now the the chapel is

full of flame and fire and ghosts and

screaming burro viens and swinging Hal

birds and cawing where Ravens in bird

form a beautiful wedding

yes would you like to hide sort of at

the back of the chapel or more toward

the front were like the doors and the

the staircases to the upper balcony are

knowing that your shadow by the way is

still on the back wall I'm gonna okay so

you're gonna get close to the shadow or

in that general vicinity closer to the

shadow than you are to the fracas going

on yeah you do that and there's

certainly enough noise that nobody can

actually hear you as well as see you at

the present so the the groom disappears

next is typical Strix you see that your

half-brother is on the balcony looking

around for what you assumed to be you

okay well I'm more concerned honestly at

this point of us all dying so is is next

to me somewhere yes okay

I'm just going to cast death Ward on

Diaz oh good news stop big scared you

can't die I can't do anything I'm like

and I'm just like shaky and I'm like you

have to help us

you have to throw knives or something do

what versus angels the demons it goes I

can't help you here you're so I don't

say I can help you so that was Strix

action to try and try and at least calm

D it down a little bit if Isaac Caesar

that's that's it I mean she's concerned

about her friends nope doesn't see you

okay so you cast the spell on DF which

brings us back to

so the ghosts who are watching this and

watching the Burrow viens accost them

they don't do they just look at the

Peruvians and watch as

weapons passed through their bodies

these phantoms don't look threatening in

the least even though the fires are

raging around them

however entering on the balcony the same

balcony that is extras Nia is hidden

upon are several bromine witches and you

can see they sort of all come in with

their grooms and look around and DF and

Strix they see you witch's brooms there

are six of them and they all set loose

their brooms this fleet of brooms comes

racing up toward you evil and as you as

palton disappears from your grasp and

usher is standing beside you and the

abbot is beating down on you with your

mace and these brooms go soaring in the

air past the Ravens overhead and there

are all these fires brewing around you

what do you do I cast in sneering strike

on the abbot at second level okay he has

to that's a bonus action okay alright he

rolled a 22 which is enough to beat your

spell save DC so as magical vines break

through the stone the flag stones on the

chapel floor and try to snare him he

tears them away they shrivel underfoot

that sucks but you still have your

action that was a

[Music]

I look around me paltin has disappeared

yes I see Asher and I just kind of like

yeah at him I see he stares he sneers at

you - yeah yeah I would hit him if even

was the hissing kind and but I see my

friend murti Kirti just killing it over

there and that's someone I want to be

back to back within battle so I go join

him and I I take like as an action I'm

gonna like fly in and high-five him what

does what does Morton kind of knew when

this construct version of evylyn with

her little winged boots flutters over

him with her palm raised you kind of

recognize her Bigby's hand also off in

the distance does the same thing which I

believe it lasts for a minute right

let's still around right so you see the

giant hand maybe it maybe it I don't

know slaps the chandeliers eye or

something something it knocks over a

bunch of candles as he does the

high-five mmm dad high-five which is not

very powerful and he's not in melee or

in battle with anything right now no

because he's got this sort of wall of

Peruvians surrounding him protecting him

right okay so then I just I guess the

high-five it is my action but if it

weren't I would yeah bold action

got it you I'd say it's your action okay

yeah I really wanted to high-five so

it's worth absolutely all right the

abbot his black angelic wings spread

wide is going to launch himself into the

air he's going to ignore the where

Ravens for the time being they will sort

of accost him as he flies directly at

you evylyn and you Morton Kynan and as

he kind of lands amid the burrow viens

and they began hacking at him their

weapons are rebuffed his divine origin

warding them he will attempt to smash

his mace down on your skull

evylyn he rolled two on his first attack

raised that's a man and in second attack

he rolled 221 so he does five points of

bludgeoning damage plus 20 points of

radiant damage for a total of 25 as his

mace strikes you there is a flash of

radiant light I know but this is what it

must feel like if he smoked by the

morning Lord I don't like it mm-hmm okay

and after he's done it is Diaz turn DFAC

six brooms racing up toward you all

right do they look at they're going

straight for me like they want yeah it

could be Strix you're not sure you're

both pretty close together but yeah

they're all right I'm gonna grab Strix

and kind of like push her out of the way

with you guys

yeah she's probably just tied off to

like a gargoyle on the roof looks like

they're kind of chasing after me I'm

going to then start running off the roof

and let them kind of chase me okay I'm

going to how far up on from the ground

are we on this roof you are eighty feet

over the ground okay is there another

building that's kind of nearby or like

an alleyway you could launch yourself

from the roof onto a nearby castle wall

that's held up by giant columns or

pillars and that connects to the

connects the castle to the outer wall

okay

I'm basically trying to find a way to

kind of something you're by that I can

quick

we descend back down to ground floor

okay Russ it's kinda like sliding down

the wall or like between to policy or

whatever yeah you could also there are

some parts of the chapel roof that are a

little bit lower so you could kind of

jump on to one of them slide down the

slanted slope and be much closer to the

ground like about 20 feet off the ground

okay that's all right so as you spring

into action and leap away all of the

brooms homed in on you great and you hit

that roof

that's slanted roof you go skidding down

the stone tiles and if you want to you

can make a dexterity acrobatics check to

achieve a landing do any of the groom's

pass by me I would say they all pass by

you can i grab one you can try to grab

one yes I'm gonna try to grab one okay

just make a check fifteen you do yes all

right and it pulls you off your feet

into the air

for the record I'm sorry acrobatics okay

30 yes you land like a cat in what

appears to be a old dead flower garden

behind the chapel fenced in by rusted

wrought iron gates all right cutting

action to - would I be able to continue

my movement or am I good there by by

this point you have moved about 60 feet

all right yeah so I'm just saying

basically continue running and having

all these brooms chased me as I continue

to make my way down to the ground floor

and then ideally towards the entrance of

the abbey or Cathedral okay

well from the outside here you don't see

any easy way into the chapel you'd have

to go through the castle somehow yeah

well alright well my turn is done I'll

figure that later yep

I'm just checking the speed of the

brooms of animated attack

one moment please dude there we go okay

bring it all right idea they're gonna

catch up with you Oh

because there and their speed is the fly

speed is 50 feet when they're going all

out yes but they won't catch you quite

yet next up is a sure the vampire he

sees is Mark coming to attack the bride

who he needs to complete his evil plans

so he is going to intercede and try to

attack is Mark but is Mark swats him

away kind of does actually pushes Asher

into some fire and you CH are

floundering around in burning oil and

then Morton Kane Jordan Morden Kainan

your turn has circled around the borough

viens do not seem to be able to hurt the

ghosts or the abbot what would you like

them to do if anything alright they

always they will attempt to do so see

and actually on maths they pull the

abbot to the floor he's got a pile of

Peruvians on top of them into the floor

it doesn't seem to be hurting the abbot

it's just annoying the hell out of them

Morten Kynan points up at the where

Ravens reverence transform and attack

the witches all right the where Ravens

they will all transform hurling

themselves naked onto the balcony and

begin to accost the witches with their

fists and just start punching them in

the face and in the body and the witches

do not seem to be impervious to their

attacks

and a couple of the - there are

two big thrown like chairs on the sort

of protruding part of the balcony and

one of the which goes gets pushed into

one of those and they're just beating

the crap out of her in the chair

the other ones attempting to hide behind

another one Stefanie hide behind the

chair and they just pushed the whole

chair down on top of her and begin

dancing up and down on top of it

the other ones are just beating and

taking out the the witches left right in

the center so they're all taken care of

Morton Canaan all right tries to grab

the bride okay let's see

all right strength saving throw here we

go oh sorry yeah I rolled up 14 so it's

got what's his strength is 26 I rolled a

14

okay so plus a 22 you succeed in

grabbing the bride this time so the big

hand attempts to crush and we'll do

because you've amped it up holy crap

so normally does normally the grasping

hand does 2d6 plus your spell-casting

ability modifier but since you amped it

up it increases by 4 T so by 2 t 6 for

each slot above v level all that's right

so 6th 7th 8th 9th so 8 d 6 more for a

total of 10 d 6 plus your spell-casting

all right I mean she's a flesh golem so

she has some resilience but you're gonna

still she does and that's plus my

spellcaster is that the my intelligence

over my spellcaster attack faster attack

bonus okay all right 53 yeah now it's

your ability modifier so it's just your

info gates

bonus okay so it's 46 great that that

does I'm sorry no no I'm sorry my bad my

bad my bad I'm incorrect it's 49 oh

great all right

you begin to crush her and you can hear

the cracking of her

as she is being just absolutely crushed

you think that one squeeze alone

probably took half our health away I'm

sorry darling has to be done and nice so

next is paltin you are standing

invisibly out of immediate harm's way

the brooms have flown off after your

friend DF look around you can see on the

balcony overhead the witches have been

tackled by the naked where Ravens and

the Peruvians have tackled the Abbott to

the floor no no my bread again so so

from what I sure told me the marriage

has to happen first and until that

there's nothing I can really do to the

shadow right well make an intelligence

check okay thankfully you're sober are

you relatively alarmingly sober yes okay

so based on what Asher confided in you

because you were so persuasive the

wedding is to appease the dark powers

basically to give you the powers of dark

Lord over this domain and thus you would

have the power to control this domain

and to lock your bride away and be with

Asher forever he's a vampire spawn he

can't really leave the domain this is

his ticket to getting being with you

eternally and ensuring that you're

basically rendered immortal with him if

you don't go through with the wedding

the only the only problem with that is

the shadow because the shadow has your

shadow because as a piece of straw

inside it has the ability to bring you

back to this domain as often as it once

with or without your friends so as long

as it is separated from you and kind of

doing its own thing and there's no

bonafide Dark Lord established

you'll never really escape it right well

the thing he was saying was like but if

if you go through with the wedding then

the shadow can because now you are one

with the dark powers and darkness the

shadow can merge with you again and

strods fragment won't necessarily be

lost or destroyed it will be sort of one

with you now but didn't he say like

using the yes once you don't see that

basic or yes now you believe based on

your intelligence core that the shadow

can be hurt by the Sun sword at any time

and you don't have to wait till after

the ceremony the only advantage to

waiting till after the ceremony is you

destroy the straw shadow before it

merges with you where do I um

you could based on what Esther said you

could destroy your shadow with the Sun

sword and some sort of solve a lot of

your problems and do I have any do I

know any reason like not to do that

would that like mess me up nope not as

far as you gather maybe you're wrong

about that but you think mostly what you

glean from Escher was this was a

self-centered effort on his part to be

to not lose the other level in his life

doesn't sound like him well he's also

evil and perverted so what now old come

on let's it's not fair let's give her

the benefit of the doubt here come on he

has an evil vampire spawn after all

sometimes do I think for the wrong head

it happened yeah love does weird things

do I see the shadow yes you can see that

in the chaos it is quietly silently in

fact moving around behind

evylyn can I try to scab it you sure can

okay

sweet what are you gonna try to stab it

with the I'm gonna stab you with the

thing that's gonna hurt it okay you draw

forth the bladeless hilt yes that

belonged to strods brother sergey and

you caused this radiant blade of

sunlight to erupt from it and that's

pretty hard to hide invisible or not

that light begins to even though the

sword is invisible in your hand the

light begins to fill the chapel it's

like up here and you can make an attack

if you want as you do you become visible

okey-dokey oh my gosh okay

swear to Christ all right as soon as the

you strike with you're not twenty into

the shadow of Strahl ttan you can see

that the light of the sword and the

darkness of the shadow are consumed and

the shadow is instantly obliterated so

as the light hits the shadow and just

like what happens to shadows when they

have nothing to hide behind they're just

sort of immediately banished by the

light about what you see is sort of at

the edge

of the light given off by this sword

traces of blackness like shards or

something or maybe bats kind of flutter

off and disappear into the darkness and

you hear strods voice sound out with a

horrible horrible inhuman cry I'm like

guys I did something yes you believe

you've just destroyed this last vestige

of strawed with the weapon that was

destined to do so what a brilliant plan

he went through with the wedding just to

get close enough to stab lightning

strikes the roof of the chapel and

suddenly it falls in yeah well actually

you're taking off the roof just in time

the dark powers themselves they're

pissed yes as they express their

displeasure at this sudden turn of

events Strix you are born off the roof

just in time is as lightning strikes the

rooftop Oh waffles is tied to that damn

gargoyle and as it hits the roof of me

could you wouldn't it hits the roof of

the chapel you see it's stones fall in

and I need Morton Keenan and Evelyn to

make dexterity saving throws yeah he's

really good at this

I know only on your turn you have here a

reaction you can potentially use that

it's fine all right I got a nine okay

sounds great I got 18 all right 18 is

good enough evylyn that you avoid the

huge chunks of stone falling from the

ceiling unfortunately at least eight

possibly nine burro viens do not get out

of the way and they are crushed under

debris in the center I'm right next to

Morgan kind and so he gets yo yeah he

gets +4 hey hey

so that 29 is a 13 make that a 14 all

right

so good news for Morton Kynan he is also

missed by the falling debris thanks so

as some borough viens are smushed and

they cry out in terror at the collapsing

roof yes a number of them

in fact you think that your power not

only saved Morton Kynan but also saved

at least five borough viens I feel like

there's a kind of a like glowing

sparkling us and the like some of the

falling rocks kind of like they

inexplicably seem to just kind of like

change course and fall around the

sparkling

I just like the juxtaposition between

Strix being dragged away by a witch

broom they've flown through the rain by

this crazy broom yes and death from down

below you see the the roof of the chapel

gets struck and you see this ball of fur

and feathers come tumbling off the

rooftop to

you oh I'm so adorably worried for it

yeah so you stop with the brooms in

pursuit do you want to catch waffles yes

then I would like you to make a

dexterity acrobatics check to do so even

if it's like a leap granted midair and

take the fall kind of save whatever just

this fluffy it's like smiling it's all

bober's dexterity acrobatics check oh

great 30 all right yes you you leap up

you pluck the albear of the air and

cushion its landing so it doesn't die

with a horrible splat and then as you

land and look around there are five

brooms all pointed at you

uh-huh like a just okay yep business

ends in just looking at you

yep seeking javelins got it yeah and

while that's happening waffles is giving

you licks all right was that my turn or

digesta no that's just your basically

reacting to the situation and then as

more of the roof begins to fall in a

large chunk comes tumbling down falls

directly on top of a sure just like gone

under debris you don't even see him in

fact there might even be like a like a

poof of ash that sort of comes out from

underneath the huge debris tragic figure

oh no my bride all right and that was

all on Paul tunes turn so as well as

they wear Ravens start to tear up the

witches on the balcony a dark lumbering

hulking fiendish figure leaps upward

clinging to wall sconces and tattered

hanging tapestries and hurls himself

bodily out through the cracked ceiling

of the chapel out into the rain perhaps

going after his sister who knows and in

that moment as music disappears from

view you can see through the hole in the

ceiling of the chapel or death if you

are outside the clouds take the form of

a giant face no thanks what much rather

thanks no and then there's more sort of

flashes of lightning behind the face

almost making it look cracked and broken

it looks like maybe Vasa it looks like a

it looks like a horrible angered straud

like village great but then the

lightning sort of flashes behind it and

it kind of tears apart cool and is

destroyed so I'm seeing that a whole

still holding the broom those of you in

the chapel

that's palton Morgan Kainan and Evelyn

you begin to see the chapel flicker

between night and the rain coming down

and bright daylight like the morning

like night stage tonight to stay it's

night to say it's nice day it's like

flashing in and out it's almost like for

an instant you seem to be straddling two

worlds the world of dark rainy brooding

borough via and the world of sunny

bright Lysander along

radiant but you're still in the chapel

it's just like for a split second year

in the rainy bomb bombed-out chapel with

all the fires and the oil burning and

the collapsed ceiling and then suddenly

you're in a perfect pristine version of

that chapel that may have existed

hundreds and hundreds of years ago

Evelyn

raises her hands in prayer she feels

like this is Lysander blessing they're

their holy work

yes Lysander shine down upon us and all

of your holy glory wash this place clean

of the darkness holy levander okay so

she's losing it basically is what you're

telling me okay strix you are clutching

onto this racing broom through the air

[Music]

all right all right okay I would like

you to make an Arcana check for me all

right come on bro all right

your initial attempts to sort of gain

control of this broomstick do not meet

with success and it attempts to whisk

you into some very large and immovable

objects so I'd like you to make a

dexterity saving throw to hang on to the

broom

all right broom that's 12 okay you are

able to hang on to the broom and not be

damaged as it's flailing flying through

the air and cork screwing around and

they say taking every measure at its

disposal to get you off of it the other

brooms all come at D F and begin to

whack on I'm so like holding onto

waffles like yeah and they're yeah all

right I'm just gonna they each get two

attacks on you so I'm just gonna roll

ten attacks and let you know if any

what's your AC currently super high

that's great all right you are hit a

total of three times

one of which was a crit so I got you

like rainy oh yeah alright so the first

one does four points of damage the

second one does six points of damage and

the one that crit you does 11 reduced to

five points of damage so you take a

total of 15 whack a whacking damage

Morden Kynan I'd like you to make an art

very comical and I gonna make an arc on

a check for me Sam this has actually a

chance during all this DF is actually in

tears as he accepts his fate you can't

die okay twenty not an at twenty but a

twenty is my room okay terrible world

you believe with that role that what

you're seeing here is the destruction of

strawed by the Sun sword has created a

fracture in time that's something it

looks like that you maybe if you stay

here much longer

the thrown backward or forward in time

alright Morden kinda looks like he's

been struck by lightning he's just gonna

leave your hand to crush the bride do I

do I notice things yes it's perfectly

obvious Morton Keenan is the loudest

thing in the room right now was raving

he's out of his mind he's got he's lost

it at this point yes and and is

well-versed in time travel and

[Laughter]

all right

and also yes your question can I can I

cast a spell while ushering yep okay um

okay I'm gonna cast more than kind and

faithful hound yeah get the pretty boy

go

all right its next yes a spectral hound

comes leaping out through the wall of

the chapel behind you d/f and

immediately sees brooms beating on you

fiercely and then another one hurling

through the air with Strix in tow I only

see tears and despair Oh God all right

and I'm sorry I'm more than kind and

after casting spell you said you wanted

to possibly move or Exeter yeah but go

back whence you came okay and you said

you're taking somebody with you I can't

remember

are you a willing accomplice to him yeah

pulling you out okay all right so he

drags you out of the chapel into the

hall where this effect does not seem to

be nearly as pronounced but even in the

hall you can see glimmers or corners of

the hall that look like they're from

another time where the the paint does

not plaster it away and they're sort of

bright and well tended and the wood is

nicely finished and do you see the light

of Lysander shining through the darkness

no all right so just to speed things up

here that was the Morgan kind in Stern

palton you're in the chapel you see

evylyn has been taken out by the crazy

mage taken out of the room not taken out

leaving you with some fleeing borough

viens is Mark who is watching as his

quote/unquote sister is being crushed to

death

by a magical giant spectral hand sort of

helpless calling out her name arena as

the rain falls onto his face he managed

to avoid getting crushed what do you do

now that you seem to be alone amidst

wreckage

you also see somewhere Ravens overhead

they've gotten back into their Raven

forms and are fleeing the chapel as

quickly as possible so I'm gathering

that people are running it seems like

people are evacuating this place as

quickly as possible I too will be doing

running all right I would like to leave

you follow the wizard out very good as

you do you see your shadow now a part of

you once more follow you and for a

moment you're startled then a little

spooked by but then you realize it's

just your normal shadow cool warm and my

hand my little my hands still with me

right yes oh god all right cool

let's go yes it'll actually help you bye

uncorking one of your flasks for you

hasn't run out it's like Oh God and then

like so I'm like I'm running and

drinking okay

d/f yes he's extra' see the half fiend

comes out of the darkness leaping down

onto the ground not too far away from

you about 30 feet away you can see his

sister being pulled hither and thither

through the air but doesn't really care

he seems to focus all of his eye on you

hold out a hand of flame and summoned

that flame forth and hurl it at you

shouting lore cthis come what's wrong he

calls you there Laura cava scum Oh No is

there a way I can not make sure it did

like wild waffles out of the way or

something

you're basically shielding her he's

making an attack role against you he

rolls a 16 which is not enough to hit

you so his little gout a flame that he

hurls it you it goes flying past and

explodes on the ground behind you yeah I

uh need it for the record awesome

excellent yep and after hurling the

flame he begins to advance toward you

threatening Li and says stay away all

right and Strix do I see all this

transpire right yes from up high yes

all right I look down at the broom and

I'm like Oh fine and all this misty step

in front of Diaz

all right dia Strix appears before you

great anything else look at Isaac and

just kind of like angrily just say

you're not part of my family these are

my family and then look really really

bad and throw my hat on the ground

because it obviously isn't doing me any

good all right and DF what would you let

I do when this happens by still getting

beat up by brooms yes they beat you up

and now it's your turn

oh if I can I guess that was my action

but if I could I would you could do

something Isaac okay I'm gonna dispel

magic on the brooms ah okay I can let's

see okay that doesn't seem to have oh no

wait that does that could affect them

yes they must make Constitution saving

throws against your spell DC what's your

name sixteen no all the brooms fall down

yes

clatter clatter clatter onto the floor

the last broom the one that's flying

through the air I was racing down and

kind of lands beside you stretch

and then just kind of nudges up toward

you and kind of like just sort of leave

it it's time to go

it's like saying no don't dispel me

don't discover me I don't want to be

dispelled on it and then like points to

the broom and says get on it we're

leaving all right

and yes so you that broom has is now

kowtow to you yes as the other ones fall

down inert but DF it's now your turn

all the brooms have fallen the threat

seems to be ended except for Isaac who

is looming above you and Strix all right

Am I

am i aware of the mass retreat happening

you're aware of you see big flights of

ravens come out of the shattered roof of

the chapel so they're obviously

evacuating and you heard Morden Cain and

belt something borderline incoherent

that suggested to you that they were all

getting out of that particular situation

okay and while you're standing there

both you and Strix momentarily see

flashes of the garden when it's vibrant

and full of life and the morning light

is shining down upon it and you catch

the whiff of fully alive roses and see

the brilliant colors all around you how

many people can this broom support

you're a little dubious it can take more

than once and now over and over all

right doesn't matter it's like okay I

feel I can kind of get a glimpse of

what's going on so I don't give a

about using right now and how pissed he

is I was like tell strike like another

day we just need to leave and then

whatever I can do to rejoin Evelyn and

Paulson wherever they are to whatever is

they're running to I guess probably

Morgan kind and okay yeah just like

we're good we're getting out of here all

right as you make that faithful decision

you can see that the darkness seems to

go away

and you are in the morning garden eASIC

is gone

[Music]

evylyn and paltin as you're out in the

hall Morden Kainan and the fiends just

sort of fade away around you you can see

that they're being pulled back in time

my last move that's correct

if there's a broken spike mm-hmm and

that's well thank you that's a very

special episode make sure you write all

that stuff down evylyn and stuff cuz you

know you got buttermilk and you got iron

spike a part of a staff and a flask of

oil yeah how many foot pole is it now

it's probably like seven and

three-quarters is that good enough to

like search for traps though yeah the

tap the our yeah so I don't need to

worry about that in spite of oil classy

broke broken staff and buttermilk all
