hi everybody nice camera action that's

right

Holly will be joining us momentarily

she's had two events crash up against

each other very tightly so expect her

shortly in the meantime let me regale

you with a story about the past that

leads into the future oh boy

so after securing the ring of winter the

waffle crew was forced to abandon the

airship they were on when Klaus the red

dragon attacked them and they escaped by

teleporting to port nyan Zaru with their

guide and the ring bearer hardest sim

bear and shortly after arriving in Port

lions aru the waffle crew was beset by

agents of the disc of the Santarem and

fearing for their safety and also

somewhat doubtful that they could reach

the city of omou and stop the death

curse in their present condition artists

decided to cut himself loose from the

waffle crew but feeling kind of bad

about it he contacted his friend dragon

bait and said you know take him as far

as you can into the jungle and when they

die from the death curse just bury them

somewhere nice and after the waffle crew

and dragon bait left artists poked

around in the city for a while until

another airship arrived this one from

the distant land of Hal Rua

a realm of powerful wizards and they too

were looking for a guide to lead them to

the city of oh Moo and artists decided

to help them and boarded their ship and

they set off and the thing that prompted

him to join him join them was the Hal

ruins brought with them a device a black

egg-shaped Force bomb which they said

they could drop on the city annihilating

it and the soul monger in one fell swoop

and so this ship set off and in the

course of its journey the Wizards on

board noticed that artists had this

powerful elven artifact the ring of

winter and they decided they were going

to take it

artists resisted and succumbed to the

evil of the ring causing the ship to

crash and stranding himself in the

jungle until as fortune would have it

the waffle crew and dragon bait happened

upon the wrecked ship the star goddess

and killed artists and took the ring in

their possession and found the Hal Rouen

force bomb in the hold

that's simplifying things a little even

called to try to just make him

unconscious he was just he was very you

know things were complicated okay yes

and he uttered his dying words and then

expired paltin had the ring at last and

the force bomb was secured away until

Strix could analyze it further to gauge

its destructive impact and she was

successful at one point realizing that

it carried within it the rough damage

potential of about ten thousand magic

missle spouse anyway

this item was eventually packed away in

with evylyn until the party became

separated and in the dream coils of den

dar the night serpent during which they

experienced some of their worst

nightmares ever it was toward the end of

evil ins nightmare as she was dealing

with the wamba's converting one of them

that the device that the device unknown

to her was activated when the waffle

crew was reunited at the end of last

week's episode they had a big group hug

and Miranda their newest

brought into the fold all gathered

around is evil and hug them all warmly

and that's when everybody but evil and

heard which is probably something

completely unrelated yeah excuse me

sometimes my body just does

another game you made it it's all good

welcome Holly thanks for joining us no

worries yep

so I hadn't suggested to me that evil

ins arms probably like I don't think

they're extended like go-go gadget arms

but I need like like I think that her

joints can go like just a little bit

bigger so she maybe has like an even

bigger arm hugs right she's got the

telescoping hug arms got skirt it's like

a little bit of an unlatching of the

elbow yeah she's just she's got everyone

all wrapped up she's squeezing real hard

yes as usual strips you're the ticking

she just shuts down so that I can go to

the bathroom really quick okay I would

like everybody else to roll initiative

oh we're still an initiative well you're

out of initiative which is why I'm

having you roll again see ten-four

evylyn 1515 we've got a powerful seven

okay seven four palton Miranda this is

the order in which you explode so just

to remind you stalling for time here a

little bit you guys are still in the

fame of the night serpent but you're in

a different chamber yes you're in a

sacrificial chamber that has an altar

upon which is splayed the blood leaded

corpse of a tiefling warlock that

Miranda seems to know or knew and there

was a secret door entrance through which

Miranda and palton entered after

surviving their encounter with the

and everybody else is sort of magically

appeared in the room the and the corpse

the blasted incinerated corpse of Roz

Niecy lies all around you and Miranda

took his flaming sword so she has that

Miranda when you hear the tick tick

ticking what do you do because it's a

strange noise to you and you think it

might be this little machine woman who's

wrapped her arms around you that's a

distinct possibility but she's also

shorter than you are and when you look

over her you can see that there is a

device in her backpack you can just sort

of see the top of it it's kind of a

black egg-shaped device and you're

pretty sure the sounds actually coming

from that ok strix wakes back up and and

tries to she's gonna Arkana check the

bomb and turn it off

I got an initiative roll okay back to

Miranda you see no subscription strix

his eyes just get slowly wider and wider

[Laughter]

that's a bomb I'm gonna use it to

destroy the soul longer listens to it

mm-hmm that's a free action Oh

I assume she's listening yeah she could

turn you can just turn your head and

hear it pretty clearly what you do yeah

oh yeah she starts to try pokey out it

let you out to death

hang on Miranda do you have any other

actions you want to take I can I look

over it and see if there if I can tell

if there's any way to turn it off you

honestly can't while it's in the

backpack now okay you could take it out

of the backpack

I will let you yeah I want to take it

out of the pack back and sit it on the

ground but I

alright you bring it out of the pack

packing set on the ground and it weighs

about 15-20 pounds it's got an iron a

black iron shell or black metal shell of

some kind you can see light pouring out

of a small circular window in one side

of the egg and on the back you can see a

recessed what looks like a clock face

dial and there is a hand behind glass

that is ticking down okay now can I find

a way to turn it off for like posit make

a wisdom perception check 19 you can see

that beneath the clock there is a small

button for lack of a better word that

has been sort of pushed in and is now

lodged in there's nothing really to grab

on to to pull it back out and that's

York that's your turn dear

you're never okay so with Miranda

currently like trying to figure out the

bomb DF Kylie starts to give himself up

to go to the bus like go check it out as

he doesn't feel like you mean like holds

his side just like kind of gets over

there still very injured from resin you

see that's right uh so then yeah he'll

heal basic at the same thing like he'll

probably see the same button and there's

no one way to rely to really unpress

button i can't imagine but i'm gonna

look at the clock device laughs cuz you

said the actual clock on there yeah

whatever mechanisms there is between

myself and strix I figured somehow maybe

we could probably at least get some kind

of idea of perhaps how much time is

actually left on this thing okay so make

a wisdom insight check insight yep to

see if you can gauge that Oh

my best

[Applause]

9 you think your guess is there's less

than a minute

watch

you say that out loud right how many

other exits other to this place good

question so there is the secret door

that paltin and Miranda opened when they

came in it's it's sort of at one end of

this rectangular room that then there's

the door that you came out of that had

the snake women in it that door still

there that's a door is still there and

it's it's open much as you left it

there's just darkness beyond but as you

recall you didn't see any other exits

out of that room okay then you also

notice scouting around that the rivulets

of blood that were pouring out of the

tiefling on the altar and onto the floor

were being channelled out through small

little arched holes on at floor level

basically little tiny little tunnels

that the Bloods were going out in theory

you think you might be able to jam the

egg down one of those we have no idea

where it would go or maybe you do you

did see blood pouring out of the main

temple of the Thane and into that basin

yeah that's always the connection that I

really have yeah and more importantly

where it were to go somewhere that it

could potentially reach the soul monger

and destroy that which I don't know

great Paul did freeze it ok next up is

evil enough do I have any sense of

knowing where the soul monger is

um let me think what have you been told

no you just know it's somewhere in or

under Oh Moo you think it's it you think

it's underground so it might not be

hugely far away from where you are for

all you know and I understand that this

bomb will iterate the whole city like

sternest restricts gave you the

impression that it was a really big bomb

like the devastation would be huge

so innocence would die I know for sure

well most of the city you know is a dead

city apart from the creatures that live

in it my babies and and Miranda secret

army I mean by the way I have a

stopwatch going so I mean let's just

leave it here let it blow things up and

right how are we get out of here in time

we don't know where we are

there's there's a big there's a thing

back that way you don't want to trust me

you do not want to go that way Miranda

could very quickly fill you in that if

you follow the secret door that they

took there's a portcullis and then

there's a big frozen section of an

underground cavern that palton sort of

unleashed his icy rage upon and then

there's a huge Hydra what if that's it

for Jared we're in a hut and sorry

where's Evan I'm sorry there will be

bill I didn't actually do anything yep I

just want to say dance you have to ask

some ESCA

No all right

that's evilman's turn or do you want to

that's used to have to be something

taken in action even oh I thought you

were cutting yeah I'm about to but

you're still got some time

evylyn wants to take it out too so

longer but she doesn't know where the

soul monger is and she doesn't want her

friends to blow up so she's just gonna

try to stop it she's gonna see if she

can figure out how to defuse the bomb

okay make a wisdom insight check nine no

color strips

I could I could try to disarm it it's

not that's like grab the bond and

dimension door outside of the temple on

her room

what Oh can't you see where you're going

stop it doesn't matter she knows where

it is it's 500 feet well she okay so she

wants to basically go 500 feet straight

up straight up okay and and she's just

gonna grab the bomb and to say I'm sorry

didn't mentioned or yeah you can do it

up to 500 feet away it can be a place

you see one that you can visualize one

that you can describe by stating

distance and direction so you're just

going 500 feet straight up that's no

problem

on her broom and you can bring along

objects

okay so Strix you we all scream you grab

the bomb that's a that's a free item

interaction for you you pick it up and

let's see you've got the so activating

your broom is action right and dimension

door is an action so you can do one or

the other well I well do I think that

it'll get it far enough away from

everyone to keep them safe honestly

you're not sure don't be a hero I mean

they'll have lots of ground between them

and you they're there they must be

pretty far into grounder decent this

decent distance underground a decent

distance underground yeah would it be

possible for me to do that and then

because I can I can i misty step after

that so you can't with a misty step I

believe that with a bonus action spell

you're limited on what other spell step

is one bonus act right and you can do

that and cast another spell of a certain

level right is it limited to a can trip

isn't that right

I don't doesn't say it just says it's

instantaneous one bonus action at this

I'm making my cards do bonus actions

oh it says chat saying it's limited to

can trips oh yeah okay you can't do

dimension Dorian could I said I

dimension door and throw it through yes

okay perfect then I won't send myself

yeah all right

you has dimension door and you hurl it

through mmm it goes out to the mentioned

or you presume 500 feet over your head

paltin okay so now it's now it's now

it's above us yes yeah so it hasn't

exploded so do I do we have a

guesstimate of how much time was left on

that thing well based on Geoff's role of

nine you think under a minute and I

could be completely wrong it could be a

thousand minutes who knows and that was

you know that was about 30 seconds ago

what will be bit will be buried if it

falls down here and explodes it's better

than being dead immediately at least

we'd have a chance ah do I have time for

a hut you it's an action so you wear a

dragon maiden the others oh they're gone

they're outside somewhere oh no celery

in rain probably in range of the okay

you have call your wait call your friend

please oh wait leo miss tiny how does a

casting time of one minute

[Applause]

what why is that so bad why don't we

want to call Joe Mishka I don't want

ever do anything exactly

paltin would you like to do anything I'm

her pet yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna tell

df2 culture Mishka with suggestion okay

suggestion spell on dia it's like you

want to be in debt or you want to be in

dead up to you yeah but it's in action

so wisdom saving throw DF what's my role

total of 14 well what's it that cuts you

what you're save I believe it's 15 yes

you are oh you're always in bandura

and you can oh that's okay okay alright

that well it's a good idea right you

think yeah yeah if you think that's a

great idea great idea you see you see

palton cast a familiar spell suggestion

and then suddenly you see DF no now if

you up if you had yeah if you have like

counterspell you could counter it if you

want I don't but yeah okay so yes DF

isn't spelled and puts his foots one

hand on that sword thinking like okay

that's not about idiot after all and

let's see whose turn is it now

it's the bombs turn

paltin you're in trouble yes yes Alton

not in trouble I've been here for like

four episodes I'd rather be alive and

deal with the problem all right

somewhere high above you the bomb falls

out of the sky and lands somewhere in

the city and continues to tick away and

Miranda the bomb is gone the dimension

door collapses and what do you do it was

the door that paltin and I came through

it was the door that diaas came through

which I I don't know what's back there

that's all the exits you see okay or you

can crawl through a blood channel and

see where that goes

[Laughter]

and as you look around yourself jarred

for a moment when you look toward your

dead companion Cielo she's kind of

staring right at you just by virtue of

you happen to be in the place where

she's her dead corpses looking yeah

can I do any of the other bodies look

familiar

is the zero among these somehow no you

know you don't see the other bodies seem

to be wrapped up in bandages like

mummies and just lying on essentially in

recessed stone slabs does it look like

there's any kind of dried blood from

where they are no no but based on based

on what you can see they look like

they're humanoid human sized okay all

right and fairly freshly wrapped they

don't look like ancient mummies all

dusty and falling apart they look like

they were recently mummified okay I I

don't know who this woman is they're

talking about I there are a lot of

things that I'm missing can I just go

over to Sierra and hold her hand

yeah I'm just gonna lean down and

whisper I'm I'm so sorry

I didn't get to you in time I tried

that's when you see the magic ring on

her finger

and I'm gonna take it very very good I'm

so sorry

[Laughter]

all right yes you can see that

Sierra's ring looks like it's made of

some sort of silvery metal or pewter and

it's got these Ram like designs to it

and you've seen you saw her use this

once or twice it's a it's a ring of the

RAM it creates a spectral ram headed

blast of force that can knock through

doors and punch through walls and things

so it has three charges and it requires

attunement and you regain one be three

charges at Dorney and between one and

three of the charges at once to

basically produce the special Ram head

and use it to smash people if you want

in addition to objects okay very good

okay the rest of you by the way see

obviously Miranda's got this connection

to this dead tiefling on the altar you

you might not see her take the ring

exactly or she might take the ring and

then mumble something the tiefling but

there is obviously a bond there that has

been suffered by the tea-things demise

and the next person to go is DF DF based

on the suggestion so yeah because of

this suggestion how would I role play

this out you would tell you did a is

there something like I would have to do

or something okay heavily consider so

here's how it works um so you're

basically charmed so you're of a

disposition to do as paltin asks as long

as it is not suicidal if it's a suicidal

command

[Music]

I'd say I'd say suggesting to not die is

quite the opposite correct yes yes yes

so it has to be a session is if it's

worded in a manner to make the course of

action sound reasonable then you you

must do it whereas if it's something

like hey D F stab yourself then the

spell ends so the spell has taken hold

which means you must do as paltin says

and take one of your keys off your ring

and insert it into the hilt of gutter

can tricks like stop that no suggestion

is mine if just takes moms like oh yeah

that is a good idea takes out gutter

all right despite everything in my head

saying this is awful I should not do

this all right as soon as you turn it a

plane of force appears before the sword

light seems to spill out of the keyhole

just to basically create this

rectangular doorway that appears before

you and I need to roll initiative for

one shamash give them a rather she's

just like I hate you what's what's she

what's so what's so bad about her I feel

like I missed that part

[Applause]

all right yes so the doorway appears and

now you're just waiting for this

shemekka to come through that's deaths

turn it is now evil ins turn you can't

wait to see our old friend how long is

the hollow suggestion lasted by the way

that's a very very good question so you

have completed the action that was

required of you which means the spell

ends great so sue that's over I can be

like

yes you're now staring at this shimmery

rectangular doorway in front of you well

I mean now that now that she's already

on the way to be like you know I'll just

go back home all right

evylyn right I understand that the bomb

has been teleported outside right yes

and I understand that waffles and dragon

bait are outside right do you I asked

Miranda I turned it Brandon I grabbed

her face I hold her close I see Miranda

where is the alla' bear and the dragon's

dinosaur looking person and the rest of

our pets and party uh we're wandering

down a tunnel and dragon baked was gonna

keep them safe and and then and I sent

celery with them I don't know where they

went

they just went down a tunnel you know

that that tunnel would have led them

outside it might have can you take me to

them oh and there's a high drought there

okay will do think it'll be fine you

start you start pulling Miranda along

you take care of these ones paltin you

hug him if it gets bad and she tries to

go for ya all right but a Hydra so evil

in it and now she's gone all right so

you just boogie on your winged boots so

you can move 60 feet if you just go all

out on your turn which is going to get

you so with 60 feet you blast through

the tunnel you slip through the icy

portcullis bars you're standing on an

underground beach in a water filled cave

there's a boat there glazed in ice ice

fanning out all around it over the water

clear behind all Finn's handiwork

and you can get that far in a little bit

further almost to the edge of where the

ice stops and the water resumes and you

can see this dark watery cave in front

of you and you don't Politan yeah you

don't remember well you've never been

down here so you don't know how far you

have to go down this water filled cave

but as far as the Hydra you don't see it

okay and that's

evylyn and next is Strix

after all this said I don't think it's a

sigil and she's just not okay so she's

just panicking okay

she's like I can't deal with this right

now like the bombs gone at least maybe

maybe death Lord do you have any of

those left I think so

I do I think I think I think I do

I took cast I only cast one I had cast a

dimension door so I have one more left

okay oh wait no wait pump wait polymorph

but then I also have sorcery spells

which I can use or sorcery points which

I can use to test another third level or

sorry fourth level spell okay so I

should does everybody do yes who's gonna

be the beneficiary of death word it's

gonna cast deaf word idea okay alright

death you got it I didn't do anything

last time she screams okay palton

hey you see you see that there's a

shimmer in the in the curtain of light

before you indicating that SHINee shkas

arrival is imminent I'm just seeing

everyone's reactions I'm just like oh

it's like I've I've worked for worse for

less so I mean you know it's okay so uh

so let's see BOM is god-knows-where just

Rebecca's on the way we know where BOM

is it's maybe 450 feet up and standing

that isn't far enough away to get from

whatever blast it's supposed to be we're

supposed to use it on the sole longer

right so it's a good thing that someone

who is capable of fixing this is on the

way in the meantime that's right just

like in the meantime I'm just gonna cast

invisibility on myself

[Laughter]

folds out of view and then Simon holding

on to his invisible but Simon reassured

by Paul Tain's leadership skills just

gives the earth a big thumbs up all

right and by Shemesh qey emerges from

the plane you can see that she is

immersed she is in a resplendent gown

that seems to have all sorts of colors

worked into and you can see that's

because it it's sort of covered in

sequins and it's picking up all the the

color of your lights and and whatnot in

the room and she's got a bird mask on

that she's just sort of holding up in

front of her face but then she takes it

off when she comes through

yeah exactly

her life is great she's got a great life

and you're about to shorten it

the she comes through and says my boys

sit talking's for free action right

essentially two into two okay

timing is an issue here conversations

will probably need to be truncated right

I like tap on your shoulder like tell

her about the bomb three questions as

succinctly as possible with minimal

amounts of rage in panic DF explains the

fact that they had just slain Rosen you

see you're on our way to get to mr. Fox

so that I complete my geese although we

had these the trouble of a goddamn bomb

about to go off and we just send it away

a little bit

and we're pretty sure is but to ignite

and blow all of us up please help that's

not the question

will you please save us from the bomb

[Laughter]

she looks around and she says where is

it bother your feet up three per

dimension door probably on the surface

of a moon or maybe deactivate it or just

yeah deactivate the bomb just for a hot

minute that way we can use it when we

want which is used to destroy the

soldiers that we're free to get their

 from mr. Fox so we could do oh well

he probably said I would do and she she

sort of leans into you and says show

some beauty my friend I wish I could

help you but if it's not here I don't

know what to do you do see she just sort

of doing a little mental calculus and

she says tell me more about this it has

the force of 10,000 magic missiles we

founded on this star fire lady starship

we found the star goddess

all right

she is going to cast a spell on UDF a

love spell and you Tod oh no and I need

you to make a charisma saving throw left

she says I can't help all of you but I

can help you know you're helping all of

us all of us are nothing she says I have

to protect my one percent and make a

charisma same girl

Paul's like yeah you know what I

probably deserve that not if this kills

us first okay she banishes you you are

banished to another plane of existence

then she will step back into the plane

and it will collapse she just literally

just sort of pointed a finger at DF and

he just went gone like his bike's gone

all right all right go we can all right

yeah I didn't call her you yeah yeah if

you find yourself appearing in a party

and there are all these people around

wearing masks many of them they're

holding up on little sticks in front of

their faces you see humans you see one

creature that has maybe a tiefling

it's got horns as far as you can tell

that protrude up above its mask which is

sort of looks like a I don't know a

spider an arachnid of some kind but you

seem to be in a very in a very large

Hall opulently decorated and you can see

small little gnome servants walking

around with platters with flutes of wine

on them and one just sort of goes right

past you and all these people who are

dressed in costume are talking to one

another in small little groups and you

can hear orchestral music playing

and sort of see over their heads that

there is a ban

and over in one corner of the hall

performing live the sea welcomed the

ceiling of this hall is arched and has

all these glass panels in it and through

the glass panels you can see what

appears to be smoke and through the haze

of the smoke a city above you high high

high high high above you you've been

here before this is signal yeah yeah and

then moments later shemekka appears and

just puts her very dental it gently her

paw on your shoulder

yeah just looking around you realize

where he is and who's around them and

who isn't and just there is just going

no no no no no no no yes yes yes yes my

boy no the others smell how about the

others we have to go back set me back

that would be suicide I don't care

I do okay to be fair I thought this

would work out a little different

Paulsen says staring at the space where

D F and shamash go were moments ago it

is now

Miranda's turn Alton's still just

pointing at the empty space just like

you see like imagine that but it was

like all of us you're invisible they'll

see it when you have an idea we need to

work on some kind of rule where you

think about it for like ten seconds

before you execute that idea whatever

I'm gonna look districts and go do you

have any idea what to do should we run

should we cry I don't know I have no

idea what to do now I think there's

nowhere to run

he's just looking where the door closed

it just like like just shaking shaking

okay then I'm just gonna go put an arm

around her and go all right I what was

back for that door Strix team what was

back there the door you came through she

actually came she didn't come through a

door strict strict sort of plopped in

from space you know I don't know what's

true this door but let's go through this

door no no no no we're talking I can

turn you all into clouds

just come here does everyone come here I

could turn you into cloud okay when I do

that on her turn no you have to do that

on your turn because it's respect I can

I can turn I can turn he's evil and

where did evil and go I could turn her

into cloud she's gone

[Laughter]

okay so you want to do anything else

Miranda are you just going to follow

strict instructions hang back till she

passes spell

okay d/f sure Mashka says you still have

two questions left

what can you date do to save the others

why would all of them huh she says I

don't know I don't exactly know what

kind of danger they're in on the bomb is

about to explode with the force of ten

thousand magic missiles above ground

probably know they're all going to get

buried alive whatever it is you want me

to do or need to do for you I can't do

it without them

I need you to complete your gaze you're

right and I need them to do it I think

you please do much stock in your friends

how dare you and then she a person comes

over and introduced it or and when she

sees him she said you're not even paying

attention necessarily what she's talking

about but she introduces you to a figure

who's like a 9-foot tall slender blue

skinned man and he's just covered just

dripping with jewels and his robes are

all gold and they've got he's got this

sort of almost like a feather boa

attached to the edges of his robe so

he's all decked out in feathers and gold

and whatnot and she says his name but

you're just like whatever and he's got a

funny hat on and he introduces he nods

to you and they're making small party

talking all you get from her is that

he's some sort of really powerful

merchant in the city obviously somebody

of great importance and they start to

laugh and for a moment the two of them

forget that you're standing there

panicking but you still have an action

technically

you

so so she banished me and now she's back

here with me that's right

I don't at the time she she doesn't

mention to this merchant she's talking

business and then the merchant wants to

know what her relationship to you is and

she says something about you being an

investment I don't know

and then she sort of reaches over grab

something and brings it around to you

and you see it's a glass of wine

you need this I'm so holding gutter

right you are okay sort of in a kind of

a reverse blade yeah

pointed backward do I still have the

other key as well you have not you have

not asked all the questions yet so you

have not she has not asked for the key

right so you have one question left

and remember remember the question the

answer is that she gives as she's told

you they she can give an answer that she

knows but she's not omnipotent she's not

omniscient she can't see things she's

never seen before

yeah yeah yeah yeah if I if I were to if

I were to turn it again we'll just bring

up before where she is or what bring you

back so you're gonna try to stick the

key back in the lock

yeah like if I just like activate it

again real fast just like will again

just when you start can you stick the

key in it doesn't turn in the lock

I turned the blade onto myself mm-hmm

like right into the chest and just have

it right there okay and just tell her

that if you want your investment put me

back or save the others threat no

negotiation I haven't heard one of those

in a while mm-hmm okay so you hold the

blade to your chest

that's your action but you got her

attention and it is even's turn even you

rock it through the caves let's see how

far you know yet one two three four five

six one two three four five six okay as

you bomb through you don't see any signs

of the Hydra might be underwater for all

you know the water is too dark to see

through yeah and you sort of get a

little bit extra out of your boots you

know you push them beyond their

tolerance levels as you zip through and

you get far enough that you can see the

end of this cavern and the other Beach

where there is still a boat pulled up

onto the the pebbles and there is a

tunnel that you know leads up and out

it's the secret tunnel that Miranda

showed you to get into the fame so but

you're still at least another round from

getting to the surface I'm just yelling

for them okay yeah

your voice is just carrying up and down

this cavern and you you think you might

hear or hear something sort of rising up

from the water like a head of a just

chill out just just sort of later this

is like after you've gone past this head

surfaces and just try to follow the

sound what about that and then it goes

back down under the water it sort of

pokes out sir looks around pokes up

looks around no more insects good

okay and then it is Strix is turn so

Strix you've got Miranda by your side

Paul Tain's invisible Simon is standing

holding onto his invisible hand what do

you want to do crying is a free action

on the ground across okay you plot down

and just pull your hat down over your

eyes this is gonna be over soon at least

alright doesn't know what else to do

Paul's gonna palms gonna interject what

the hell are you doing so just sit there

good yeah a broad tried I tried stuff I

didn't I didn't it didn't work well but

she just looks just like rage I just

says you made him used the key people I

know and I barely know you

doesn't and palton who is your turn I

take a step forward okay so you don't

see palton cuz he's invisible but you

see Simon still got home by the hand he

know I'll read visible myself just to

show the step forward right so palton

will dramatically reveal himself and

then step forward with simon there and

Simon's holding on to Portland's hand

and looking at you defiantly

fine well Strix is gonna look at paltin

let's go pike off and just turn into a

cloud you see no you did this you

started this you are such a shy if I'm

about to doll I'm not gonna do it I'm

not gonna spend my death taking commands

from you or anyone I'm not gonna be

bossed around in my last minute to 1,000

minutes still a little gray on how much

time we actually have I feel like it's

been a lot longer than a minute

no do you know what won't get crushed to

death is a cloud

you know what won't blow up is someone

who's not here I don't worry when but

he's not here I'm assuming somewhere

with

less explode ease it look fancy but

here's the thing you hurt your friend

and now she's the only one that's a

cloud instead of being nice to her which

you know sometimes works you just did a

little emotional stabbing maybe

eventually at some point maybe just a

suggestion not a command just gonna take

a little swig of wine you know which

door a big like too many headed ugly

looking thing and so far that's really

the only thing I can see happening is

either us going through that door or us

just sitting here and being useless and

dying and I'd rather not die useless uh

evylyn went out the way with the with

the hydrorite

that's Karen going really fast as fast

as their little wings would take her um

let's see here I'm gonna I'm gonna look

at marina be like can you fly hmm oh

that's a shame and I'm gonna hop on my

mandolin and go out the way win-win

alright alright alright

so paltin hops on his mandolin and

mm-hmm he plays a little chord on it

first and then he hops on and it takes

off like a broom and he shoots out of

you shemekka looks at da that says this

should be interesting

go ahead my boy let's see the worm

inside you

okay so one question left holding sword

I guess last last chance less tempt how

do I disable the heleluyan bomb you

can't

great okay it's too late it's never too

late

that's her action and she says but if it

makes you feel better I can arrange to

have at least two of your friends

brought back from the dead thank the

little worms in them their souls won't

be lost forever does that make you feel

better my boy that's not enough there's

more than two next up is oh boy you are

now you're now alone in this chamber

with your dead former companion and a

ghostly gaseous version of Strix who's

not me who's not making any noise right

now but it's clearly agitated there's

tears coming off this ghostly team I'm

gonna go sit down next to strips and and

you've stirred it out you just got one

you got one bed you pygmy with you too

right you got potato he's just still

cradled in my little arm yep it's really

the thought that counts against under

strict some I don't know what's gonna

happen but just uh I don't know don't

give that okay I mean you can give up on

paulten I really don't give a about

him right now he's whatever but it's

it's hard to find words for this when

when things are their worst there's only

one direction to go you know and

everything sucks right now so if you

just power through everything will be

better that's the only way you can go

you just have to come back or you know

get out of here safe if you can all

right did you want to do anything strix

just not not action wise but you can't

really talk but any sort of reaction

I'll just I mean I can't I can't

uncloudy

it really doesn't matter but I'll just

cloud up next to her okay I'm just kind

of like sit there as a cloud I'll write

DF

uh-huh

you can see sure Mashka she sort of gets

tapped on the shoulder by a couple who

have been very interested in talking

with her all evening and she turns

around and turns on the charm and starts

to play nice with them and at least for

the moment has her back to you

just occasionally shooting a little side

eye out in your direction to make sure

you're not completely melting down but

she is back to entertaining I'm not the

most you noticed she hasn't asked you

for the key yet right

uh I'm not the most magically inclined

person but do I know that she you

specifically used the spell vanish on me

no you've never been subjected to it

before yeah so I would really know

anything about it right no you think it

for all it for all intensive purposes to

you it's like a teleport spell it's just

taking you yeah much place than

you've ever been

[Music]

okay it's curly Ranma other do I see any

other exits or any other place other

possible places I could go there are

tons of exits there are staircases that

head up two balconies there are big

beautiful arched doors in every wall

space so far I mean there there are like

twelve ways you could leave this hall

mm-hmm and she has her back turned

towards me yeah

all right god when you look back you can

see up on the above a high balcony

you're you're kind of at one end of the

hall so you're closer to some of the

doors than you are to others at the far

end where the musicians are when you

look up high you can see there's this

beautiful stained-glass window up on the

second floor it's circular and big and

it looks like a clock face except the

hands are spinning around one hand is

going one direction and the other is

going the other way very fast and it's

monstrous I mean this stained-glass

clock is at least 14 15 feet in diameter

it's just a feature that strikes your

attention you're not sure what its

significance is there's so much else

going on here

but that strikes you as particularly odd

I another way to go with another short

little waiter goes by it with it yeah

drinks

I turned the blade away from myself yeah

stealth up to Shemesh go and put the tip

back at her back just so she feels it or

not that she feels it so that she feels

it so that I can say something and if

it's the wrong answer it's going in okay

yeah you get her attention she feels the

little poke of the tip of this sword

uh-huh and she stops talking

okay boy return me or save them all

she turns away from her guests and looks

back to you and says you really want to

go back yes

what if you go back and you can't save

them what will you have gained

I'll save them and if I don't I won't be

separated their fate is the same as mine

this is exactly why your mortals have to

try to destroy and nearly destroyed the

multiverse twice already and she says

with some exasperation there's anything

in the long run but you know if just

kind of gives like a silent quick nod

the key gives her the keys oils her

fingers around it clutches it to her

chest and then banishes you again do you

want to make a saving throw no I want to

go back okay you are flung out of her

existence all right

you up here next to the hell ruined bomb

it's just lying it's lying it's lying in

the garden of a crumbled down palace all

around you it's pillar at arcades all

collapsed and the pillars leaning and

smashed upon the ground but it's sort of

circular indicating that you're

basically in the core of the old Roman

Palace and it's just sitting there in

weeds amidst broken statuary so ancient

that you can barely recognize it there

are a few bats circling overhead but

you're pretty much on your own here and

you hear it

and that is you evil

you emerge from the tunnel into open air

as you gain some altitude to look around

still calling out for waffles and and

company make a perception check to see

if you spot them or notice anything else

okay

excellent natural 20 okay so as you look

around oh Moo looks pretty much as you

left it although it's probably darker

like there's huge shadows being cast by

the cliffs over portions of the city but

you can see the river coursing through

the city you can see smoke coming out of

the fissure at one end of the city you

can see all the old buildings overgrown

with vines around you you can also see

around the tunnel entrance from which

you emerged there are other veggies that

have come out and are basically waiting

to see if their Queen their goddess

emerges and as you come out there

they're all sort of looking up at you

with some mystification but they're

silent and they don't smell anything but

as you cast your eyes past them and get

over they're loyal to sort of get over

their loyalty and you look out you don't

know what it is exactly maybe it's a

flicker of dragon baits sword off in the

distance but you see a flash of the the

the Setting Sun hits the blade shines in

your eyes and you just see it gleam off

in the distance and its way up out of

the city on top of one of the cliffs Wow

like a hell a distance well with your

roll no you wouldn't

not yet you think you might have to go

higher because if if your direction

sense is good and

based on your 20 you think it is that it

would have came up and then fallen

probably directly in the Omo and palace

and the omen Palace is the series of

concentric walls these circles of walls

which are quite high when they're fully

formed see above them yet so it felt it

fell in the palace you know that much so

I see I see dragon base sword glint and

I just assume that he's looking at me or

I can see me and I'm like wow as a

matter of fact from you know all the way

across the city at the top of the cliffs

he sees something bright and golden hit

the Setting Sun light this golden glow

in the air over over the city of Omo he

sees you looks back at you and continues

to quickly make his way as far away from

the city as possible yeah with with

little baby Triceratops in his arms and

waffles by the caller okay yes and

[Music]

that's when you see in the courtyard

there were tumbled down courtyard of the

palace DF you see him that and you

probably see the bottom - oh you

actually know you can't you're to go up

I mean you you moved out of the tunnel

and then you went up that's pretty much

it for you but you can call out to him

that's a free action what are you doing

there get out leave it I got it go get

safe

don't you shake your head at me what's

wrong

alright Strix would you like to do

anything I will just turn back in

districts next door and oh okay and I

have another gaseous form and I'll cast

it on her are you willing to receive the

spell Miranda has to be a willing target

um can I tell her something first before

she tries to cast it on me yeah you can

okay let's save that for yourself

I lied to Halton you want to let you in

on it I might default it I can turn into

things so well I can turn into things

too

do you want to fly out why though I can

find my broom let's do that okay then I

will turn into a falcon or I don't know

what's like the stealthiest fastest bird

I've ever seen probably a raptor yes

excellent alright so you turn into a

raptor and alright and I guess I'll just

be like and that'll actually be on your

turn Miranda so that's something to look

forward to

[Music]

so strengths I just don't even like if

everyone's gone everyone's left me I

don't even want to survive Miranda's

here

oh my phew thanks Miranda let's go find

them okay

I'm sure like Turner staff into a broom

okay and you hop on and big out of smoke

billows out behind you is you take off

after polkan

worked better and then circling around

Halton you've you're writing on your

mandolin going as fast as you can you go

out between the portcullis bars over the

icy stuff that you did to freeze the

water and you're able to get past that

into the dark cave and you can't see

again can i flying in pitch blackness if

I were to ferry fire

my way can I do is it only on creatures

or I'm gonna check that but it might be

possible to cast it on yourself no you

can outline an object okay can I just if

I outlined like my mandolin with that

I'm gonna end up just to see um so you

 your your mandolin will shed dim

light and a 10-foot radius so you'll

have like ten feet of distance out which

you can see okay

so that that would be at least enough to

know I'm not going to hit a wall correct

yeah okay also I'm going to very

tempting target I'm aware okay so as you

book out over the water the Hydra I have

to roll initiative for it to see where

it's gonna land in all of this business

okay we'll get to him it but yes you are

glowing and not in danger of hitting

anything and you make your way out or

you start to make your way out over the

water of this sunken passageway and then

it is she's she's out so now we're back

to Miranda Miranda you become a raptor

you fly out there strips I'm gonna try

today as high as I can and stick to

places where I would be mostly in the

dark I'm gonna skirt as much as I can

around the water I don't understand

I can't do that yeah as you as you

follow Strix out you get past the

billowing smoke coming out of the back

of a broom you do enter that que that

frozen cave again and you are acutely

aware that there's a Hydra in there and

you keep as close to the ceiling as you

possibly can because that's smart okay

and then it is the hydras turn so paltin

is you're zipping along all glowy one of

the heads will try to come up out of the

water and snatch you up out of the air

it has cool because you are lit by a

faerie fire it has advantage on attacks

against you yeah well is it attacks on

me or my mandolin alright well thank you

very technically it's your mandolin

would you prefer if it attacked your

mandolin I think okay all right so it

snaps with its teeth with advantage and

catches air yeah I see you from the

second and then you see a wall you like

whoa yeah but you have evaded the Hydra

it only gets basically an opportunity a

terror just one attack against you yeah

d/f you are standing over the ticking as

soon as like the SPI seborrhea what is

it like there's the bomb in front of I'm

still ticking I like the desperation and

panic and with all that heightened

emotions like it reaches such a point

that it all just washes away and now

he's just in like this completely serene

state as he stares at it and the first

thing she kneels onto it starts taking

the bomb and it's going to find a way to

disable it now barb are you telling us

that there was indeed a keyhole on this

bump I want to try whatever remaining

keys I have on this keyhole first

barring any

that that doesn't work then it's off of

these tools I'm opening this up I'm

either going to disable it find a way to

return time or just jam it i preferably

just jam it so it stops altogether okay

so you gonna take one of your remaining

keys yep starting with that if that

doesn't work there's the fuse tool to

open it up and then disable it jamming

will have what four keys left or far I

have four keys Lucky's not okay you

stick that key in and it turns and you

hear it click and the bomb stops

I'm just holding it right there and just

not moving or doing anything else just

turn okay that's your turn and and then

you see your key just sort of

disintegrates oh great

so I lost a key yeah okay and I think

the same thing I believe the same thing

happened when you open the tome of

strawed that Kili I don't do that one

disintegrate I don't remember I remember

it's been so long yeah

power score check here actually no let's

no it didn't I don't think it's actually

your key this key did not disintegrate

either okay good you're fine and it's

still it's still in the bomb yeah I'm

gonna key up there isn't it okay then we

come to Evelyn yeah you type down you

see that the idea has stuck a key in the

bomb and it's not ticking well superhero

lands her feet like crack the ground and

she's like grabbing for the bomb already

and she's like it's not I'm gonna take

it up into the sky and I'm gonna take

his Barb's I can't just go poof and it's

gonna be fine you guys will be fine okay

I love you bye evylyn it's off how do

that

I used one of my cheese I kind of show

her the keys still being in there do not

touch it

Oh helped us after all

not-so-nice no no she didn't

[Laughter]

no she did not

okay so evylyn that's u-turn strix

you're barreling through you see some

bubbles in the water below you with your

dark vision you can see a hulking

reptilian form with many heads but

you're just flying in darkness it

doesn't pay you any heed you blow past

it followed soon thereafter by Miranda

and palton you emerge from the tunnels

from the from the water-filled tunnel

you go up the the escape hatch and you

break the surface and as soon as you do

you see these this semicircle of veggies

standing again they look hopeful and

then their hopes are dashed as you and

you you gaze out into the city of omou

as the Sun is disappearing over the

distant horizon and everything is

starting to look pretty dark down here

you don't see evylyn you don't hear any

earth-shattering kaboom what do you do

space modulator can i I like try and

could I look like take a look around to

see if I see where they went

yeah you can make a perception check ok

ok well me I guess ok don't

perceive them so I'm gonna use locate

creature to see error if they're in if

they're within a thousand feet of me

which creature would you like to locate

let's locate evylyn sandshoes yeah

you can pinpoint her she's not terribly

far away from you she's about 100 120

feet in one direction which puts her

kind of in the center of the palace oh

okay I'm gonna start headin over there

okay Miranda you follow Strix down the

passageway and to make a long story

short we are out of initiative

eventually paltin was that will be the

next person to land on his mandolin

followed by Strix on her smoke billowing

broom followed by a raptor with

resplendent feathers and some and some

choice words for paltin probably but

you're all together in the center of the

palace good are we good is it done

yes just like on the ground like yours

cross-legged like holding the bottom

Eska disarmed it out here right how did

he end up out here he went through the

portal now he's not here he's on the

bomb Derek's just she just she just

looks at pulse and she just like that

whole like that fire thing the Rosnay

see fake is like again she's like don't

you ever cast that on any of these

people ever again ever okay to be fair

situation could have been more under

control had to bomb up and transport it

out before anyone could try to do

something about it don't blame me for

that blaming you just saying and event

triggers another so don't blame me for

like

[Laughter]

you guys are both so awesome I'm so glad

you're here I love arches aren't we all

just so good she kind of pulls them in

she's like patting them and comforting

them

oh good lord I'll turn 2d yet I'll say

look I know that wasn't the coolest way

to go about that and I'm also not saying

that that worked I'll leave it up to

chance that things played out the way

they did I don't know what she went I

don't know where you went but we're not

exploded so for now I'm gonna say we're

in the green paltin you look around and

Simon's not there way no Simon while he

was on my mandolin oh you put him on

yeah sorry don't scare me don't do that

he's there sorry first thing I'm like

awful over Ben try and pick him up off

the ball Simon walks over and just like

holds the key okay yeah do you look kind

of like slowly rise to his feet again

just in a very oddly eerily calm state

just like stand up would like to take a

deep breath then just I understand you

were doing what you thought was best

stress I understand you're doing - we

had to get rid of it

everything's fine well okay

d/f will turn back to paltin and say but

I have never been more hurt in my life

he'll walk past him and go to Miranda

and we'll say I'm sorry we couldn't get

to your friends in time it's okay um we

all knew coming in here what was it

steak and I didn't really expect us to

survive very long to be honest but uh

you know at least I know now right but I

can only think for you for all the help

that you gave you didn't have to do any

of that and this is our task this is our

mission I can't ask you to go along with

us I have nothing else I have no one

else really

I have potato and that's it

if you need me I will be there should we

need you where can we find you probably

these guys she points after her like

army that's probably followed her in

here it's possible I don't think they

would have recognized her as a raptor

hmm

say they're probably still going outside

yeah so it's just you and potato I have

nowhere else to go so I will probably be

here with them I'd like everybody to

make a perception check well know which

tricks his fault hold on hold on because

she just like

like activated and so her carelessness

but everyone in danger so assuming that

I'm gonna roll really poorly it's

because she's like paltin well have once

everyone else's perception first also

eighteen 2019

I got a nineteen but before we try and

before even a of that before anything

was perceived Alden just turns to

deities like hurt hurt is what you're

going with dire means everyone's lives

at stake and you know again I said I'm

not taking credit I'd like to think

indirectly it played out in a way where

everyone gets to walk away in one piece

no no I didn't even look I wasn't

looking for it thanks I wasn't looking

for a good job I wasn't looking for a

wrist slap and I wasn't looking for a

guilt trip I thought we came out neutral

but you know what that's how it is and

you know what that's that's where I

gather I gathered that you know what

there was never a good click with us so

and hey the appreciation was shown and

you know what she's great and I get it

and it's fine and Bolton's gonna just

open a dimension door and just out okay

my family feud I don't understand what's

going on here

so I'm sorry strict zero to 20 right

yeah and DFU rolled a 1818 Miranda you

rolled a Paul Tain's gone he stepped

through a dimension door did you want to

take Simon with you cuz you can you can

take one other creature Paulding mmm

what do you need some yes okay all right

yeah Simon will hop in right behind

Pauline just as the dimension door

disappears even like tries to reach your

hand through the door as it disappears

like she feels a tingly but that's it

[Music]

yeah and he took your son he can't go

too far Kenny Miranda you are

backstabbed pip what you get you get a

sword through the back I need you to

make a constitution saving through we

just wanted to keep one and PC alive

yeah okay so you'll take half damage

from the poison that's good ahh

the rest of you see okay oh she made it

the first time but that's great I'm so

yes I'm glad I'm actually glad you

reminded me that's good

so as you all watch Miranda sort of lets

out this gasp of air and you

see that behind her is this small

halfling sized creature covered in

scales

he just plunges his short-sword right

into her back and Miranda you take 32

points of damage from the sneak attack

plus 5 points of damage from the poison

for a total of 37 and you hear him say

SS for abandoning us oh okay this is

this is your old halfling buddy Typho

fat right yeah let's roll initiative for

those who are present 24

evylyn lucky one what do you want for DF

Miranda 1414 and Strix 1616 okay good

news DF you're the first good how much

for this what a backstab

looks like so in me like get myself into

a position and just got her like

straight into him nice and he's

currently engaged with Miranda that's

correct yeah that's right oh yeah boy oh

so not good

26 that is definitely a hit

go ahead all the guys are coming out

well most of dice only one one okay ooh

Danica 25 now all right

so he takes that that is a grievous

wound for him and he cries out and evil

and you're next

so this creature has just gotten Miranda

in the back and then DF just still flee

comes up and slits him one and he shouts

out in pain even like almost passively

tree veins the heck out of him

all right make your first attack 24

that's definitely hit can i retcon also

that she's doing this two-handed what I

was saying it's like she's just she's

like like I said oh it was just passive

yeah that six second attack is 19 that's

a hit too and that's gonna be a 1/8 okay

he is still alive after getting whacked

on and stabbed multiple times now and it

is he he goes basically at the same time

as strict so strict so what would you

like to do when you see this halfling

you want e creature I'm going to

oh yeah I have plenty of those left I'm

just gonna fireball him okay this huge

expired ball ball explodes in the

courtyard of the palace it's strangely

engulfing only this little creature go

ahead and roll your damage screaming oh

okay

so he has evasion and he rolled in that

twenty on his roll so he dodges out of

the way of the fireball in its entirety

okay

so suddenly you're surrounded by smoke

and the smell of burnt branches and

vines but he is no worse for wear

well I'm useless then dear when I

brought tried to move the bomb all right

and then he goes he is going to go after

Miranda again he's going to make two

attacks one of them is going to hit you

Miranda and he does fourteen points of

damage

I'm sorry twelve points of damage I

can't add twelve his second attack

missed

he caught empty air and it is your turn

Miranda did you say that bomb of the

summer court was an action it is a bonus

action okay and then I'm going to find a

furious and right man that just starts

sobbing absolute guttural heaves as she

has to do this but she's gonna have

insect fly again okay

I believe a saving throw in his future

[Laughter]

yeah Constitution save me through yeah

okay so you engulfed him and he fails so

he is going to take you casting it at

its normal level fifth level I guess yes

yes so you're gonna take you're gonna

deal for d-10 piercing damage as he is

not on my insects 25 oh my gosh okay so

he starts to scream as these insects

begin to chew all of his flesh and he's

trying to cover his eyes as he's doing

it he is still alive and still in this

little cloud that's around him and

unless he it looks like at the start of

his next turn creature you almost also

make this a mystery when it enters the

spells area for the first time on a turn

or ends its turn there okay so he'll

have to either move out of the area on

his next turn or he'll take the damage

again and then it comes back to DF so

you see all these insects begin to swarm

around him that doesn't prevent you from

attacking him by all right well yep you

can have another yeah this point is just

lending out so much pent-up frustration

oh wow

after bonus is 11 that's a Miss okay

alright

I lost my common cool so it's just

wildly evylyn there's such a little guy

he sure does have mulatto he does have a

lot of hit points yeah what this

yeah I guess I'll just keep hitting them

these adventurers man they're tough he

would not she kind of like turns to

Miranda as soon as like

not anymore oh good cuz I'm gonna I'm

gonna chop them up 17 oh yes that's it

and that is a 13 damage okay does he

need more uh he does he doesn't need one

more guy alright okay 22 oh yes that was

my second attack in case anyone in case

anyone in chat is watching and that's 16

okay you kill him

evylyn just chops him down into the

ground until he's a bloody pulp and

there's like all these flies now just

sort of they just land on him and begin

feasting on his body it was like that's

just real unpleasant kind of wipes her

bags off and as the combat ends he once

again feel the pangs of Portland's

absence she just kind of stares back at

where that door was and blinks uh yeah I

mean even after the bad DF does even

take a moment to even recognize Miranda

and what she's even currently going

through instead DF just starts calling

out at the top of his lungs just Bolton

hold on

sorry he turns back to evylyn I I'm

sorry

and that's where we'll stop we'll find

out next week you know you went 500 feet

in some directions okay he's definitely

500 feet away definitely within earshot

yeah that first dimension door maybe

absolutely all right

hand-in-hand sorry sorry sorry your

fireball didn't blow anything up I

get rid of to three-quarters of the

party okay usual a dense minster and the

dice camera reaction sovereign all kinds

of cool fan art fanfiction lots of

theories as of late especially with the

most recent episodes we thing to go over

well I'm very excited to look a little

bit me too yeah yeah Civil War - yeah

slash dice camera actions BAM that link

and there may be some discussion there

about you know you know what would

happen if the bomb had gone off while I

was prepared for that eventuality

unfortunately it never came so OH

unfortunately he says yes

no I said fortunately you're putting

UNH's in my mouth if you look at his

notes it's just that shrug emoji right

but during the episode I was like

crossing stuff out that I knew was no

longer even worth looking at because it

was never gonna it just says bomb

explodes fine fine more additional
