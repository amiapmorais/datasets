buddy welcome to dice camera action

you fanfare welcome back Jarrod hello

the house is destroyed

all right the record I have not watched

last week's episode yet well you weren't

that's great I mean that's pretty so it

makes me make sense if I don't know what

happened dummy you've got anti research

yeah yeah this way you know sir cheats

yeah so DF yes you left water deep to

clear your head

you took a fishing pole with you and you

headed out the river gate you made your

way down out of the city into the

farmlands east of Waterdeep and then you

crossed a farm you went through some

woods to get to a river and you've

probably been to this river in the

course of your life multiple times on

various occasions with friends and

without you find a quiet place on a rock

where you can sit cast the line into the

water and listen to your thoughts and

nature and just kind of get away from it

all that sounds nice yeah it's it's

really lovely you you are reminded that

not every corner of the world is a

dangerous place that wants to eat you

you see a gambling fawn and after after

spending X number of hours and maybe

catching fish and just kind of letting

go and enjoying the relaxation of it all

is there anything that you're you're

trying to get out of your head in

particular everything okay

I mean there's quite a bit

yes thinking a lot about Strix becoming

a bee stinger mm-hmm and what she more

or less did for herself and them in the

multiverse mm-hmm

in his head he keeps replaying their hug

the afterwards

yeah just like remembering that kind of

race the embrace yeah yeah but it was

also thinking about all the

responsibilities that he still has to do

like going and finding a lady was a

regin are right yeah right yeah finally

near as gnar the whole trash piles and

finding those harsh mints he's been

thinking about that and trying to do

research into that thinking about the

weird left-hander stuff back at the

temple mm-hmm yeah but I think other

words that probably stick with them more

more and more are the things I heard

from Magnus Burnside yeah

oh it's almost like you see his face in

the clouds there for a minute no after

all the advertisement for his wood shop

right of course yes after mulling over

these thoughts and being alone for a

while you make your way back before it

gets dark you cross the fatty through

the farmyard again and you can actually

see because it's springtime there's

actually a farmer and his family out

there and they're they're getting ready

they're tilling the land to get ready to

plant seeds and he just tips his straw

hat to you and lets you carry on I'm

sure he's seen countless fishermen criss

crossing over his property before with

no great concern you make your way up

the dusty road back to the city and then

you see unusual for the river gate a bit

of a line people backed up out of the

gate waiting to get in this is not

typical of this gate in your experience

because it basically just leads down to

pasture land in small little village

area it's more likely to find a

backed-up crowd at the north gate or the

south gate which are connected to the

main roads that run through water deep

but when you come here you are a little

bit

I mean by the slowness of this and there

are people out just sort of waving their

hats and talking and kind of really

bored with the whole thing and wish they

could just get into the city and so you

know you kind of take it upon yourself

to move ahead and then you get to the

gate and you realize oh they're

dismantling a wagon and some of the

guards are sort of holding a guy in

questioning him probably because they

think he's some sort of criminal or

they've mistaken him for one and so

they're just sort of dismantling his

whole wagon and checking his saddlebags

and all that and he's becoming more

angry and angry with this whole affair

and denying that he is the individual

they claim and you can see a couple

guards standing off the side and they're

looking at a piece of paper which might

have some sort of like image of a figure

that they are looking for on it and

looking at him and looking at the paper

and looking and looking in paper all of

this no rate concern to you but you're

not really willing to spend the next 45

minutes in line so using your new

reliable talent you just kind of slip

through the gate like a slip of paper

caught on a breeze and nobody even

notices as you amble in words leaving

the line and the guards and the

dismantled coach and the aggravated man

behind and in rain in the dwindling

hours of the day you find yourself in

the trades ward where you can take care

of some other business and whatnot

before heading up into the North Ward

where you live yes you can even make a

you can even swing a little bit south to

a watch post and find out that the watch

there is a record of the watch assailing

a building in the doc ward in response

to the whole garbage incident okay they

basically stormed the address that you

gave them found that it was sort of a

derelict structure haunted by Ken ku and

basically murdered as many of them as

they could fired and there there there

are some reports that maybe one or two

of them might have gotten away but they

basically purged that place of any

threat hope that's better so at this

point in time they're not there they

sort of kind of taken care of it okay

yeah

and they tell you according to the

reports the Kangoo were very aggressive

when they were confronted and so he had

to be killed yes they weren't going to

subject themselves to any kind of arrest

all right it's good when you make your

way up to the North Ward and you walk

into troll skull alley the fishing pole

and maybe a few groceries in your care

you come up you lay eyes upon the manor

for the first time you see that the cap

on top of the turret is gone and it's

just a blackened ruin like the whole top

of the turret was blown off

that's deaath actual reaction yeah and

you get to the front door and you

realize it's not locked

so you go in there's still a lot of

charred remains of things in the tap

room where the explosion of the motor on

happened but you can see there's a pile

of lumber kind of lying on the floor as

well not too far from the blackened bar

and speaking of the bar lying on the

floor not too far away from it upside

down is a package wrapped in string the

package itself looks like it's a little

dented and smashed but is still intact

it's a it's a bigger than a shoebox

sized box wrapped up in string there is

no sound of anyone here the place looks

completely vacant your calls to your

friends are met with no response again

usually when death comes home the first

thing he hears is evylyn shouting from

some other room right deaths home yeah

do I do I hear theirs

nothing upstairs yeah you go upstairs

you dump the fishing pole off somewhere

you don't see any sign of your friends

they seem to be gone at the moment

waffles is gone

Simon is gone everybody's gone tonight I

check the blown off cap yeah you can see

that when you go up there it's clear

that strikes detonated a fireball up

here no if there was nothing up there

the need when you go back downstairs you

can see well paltin paulten left his

chair there's also the smashed remains

of another half-burnt chair lying near

that chair oh and the my chair looks

especially more like just a little more

upright and confident yeah and then you

notice on one corner of the bar you see

a knife sticking out you didn't notice

that when you came in I have so many

questions do I recognize the knife at

all no you've never seen the knife

before and it's sort of a cheap dagger

really and but you see that there's a

piece of paper pinned underneath it to

the bar okay and on that piece of paper

you see a symbol that looks like a

circle with ten spokes short spokes

radiating out from it and written above

it scrawled really are the words I have

your albear what do I recognize the

symbol you make a history intelligence

history check okay oh heck just reliable

talent only worked for skills I'm

proficient in I forget dat that bone

let's find out for the fans reliable

talent where are you

there it is when you make an ability

check that lets you add your proficiency

bonus yeah so there you go okay so eight

nor you know mm-hmm okay

well that's concerning and I can only

assume that the others are probably

chasing after trying to find whatever

the hell that's about is there anything

about this package that seems suspicious

the knots that are used to tie it look

especially challenging try me

I have been cutting open the hops DL

just uses nimble fingers yeah

so you just very quickly run your

fingers over the knots and they

practically just untie themselves in

your hands and d Ithaca much heather has

a hand on moon splinter as he's doing

this just in case cell T's gonna pop out

and like try to bite them like a snake

or something okay inside this box

nestled in colored paper is a blowing

horn not not a huge one kind of a short

easily transportable one and it's even

got a little chain on it that you can

loop around like a belt loop or

something like that you can see that

it's really beautiful carved horn all

right is there anything about this horn

that seems familiar or magical but I

would need I want these tricks for that

mm-hmm it just seems like I'm very very

very finely made wooden horn weird yeah

okay I'll just hold on to that for now

okay and then she said nothing about the

dagger was was not worthy yeah okay

death will then just drop off all those

other stuff that you brought home like

the procedure ball all the groceries

whatever take that piece of paper with

assemble out it and it might immediately

head back out into the streets of

Waterdeep first he's gonna do is contact

the rest of his um his seedy underworld

information brokers and try to learn a

thing can about this alright

cuts to three children a ten-year-old

girl with dark hair and a wooden sword a

nine-year-old tiefling boy with a

tattered cloak and a small bow and a

quiver with some homemade arrows stuffed

in it and a portly lad of nine years

wearing a Wizards cloak with lots of

pouches for his spell components a

crooked little wooden wand and a stuffed

al bear familiar companion tucked under

one arm you guys are the bestest of

friends and you have crawled down to one

of your favorite haunts which is this

dungeon complex in the sewers but not in

the stinky part of the sewers and sort

of one of the cleaner less rekey part of

the sewers and this is a complex that

you have played around in since you've

been friends and you've been friends

over a year enjoying each other's

company and all that Waterdeep has to

offer for people your age and but one of

the things you discover recently was a

secret door sort of in the side of a

sewer tunnel and you were able to with

your combined effort and some of jinxes

mighty magic convinced the door to open

and let you through into a small dark

little chamber with an ordinary door at

the far end of it and what looks like an

arrow slit in one wall that so sort of

choked with dust and cobwebs that you

don't think anybody has peeked through

it in in years this is a this is a part

of the dungeon that you haven't really

explored in great lengths before

for the record was did he use actual

magic or is like pretend magic and then

the door opens jinx jinx thinks he has a

very very powerful magic his friends

have never seen it

he Jenks will Jenks will tell you in

great detail the the spells that he's

able to cast and the powers that he

possesses and he he will vouch for the

intensity of his magic I know so much

magic and I'm really good at it my best

spell is an sky tzer's scorcher

squigglies like hell yeah it is dude I

know I know what I'm doing I promise and

that's like yes you you know magic thank

you I am the best wizard on the entire

planet it's that's true it's totally

true thank you and as relieved as the

three of you are confronted with this

door ahead of you you see that it's

actually it looks like at some point it

must have been kicked in or broken in

because it's locking mechanisms just

sort of shattered and there's actually a

hole where the door handle would usually

be and it's as you approach and you peer

through that hole in the door you can

see a landing beyond with a short

staircase leading down to a large

chamber that much to your surprise has

torches flickering in sconces along the

walls you've never seen torches lit down

here before and you hear voices in the

distance some distance away guys it's

lit down there we should go squiggly

just starts going toward it all right

yes squiggly pushes open the door Matt

tries to push him back and be like no no

me first

oh you need a minute got it all right

I'll go first

I should I need to make sure that

there's

there's no dangerous magical traps okay

do that and then I'll go down there yes

tell me what their sword medicine yes

thanks does like a jinx like takes his

wand and it's just like does a circle I

keep points at some things like maybe

like tiptoes a little bit like it's safe

yes this honestly all sounds exactly

like me playing D&D when I was there and

jenks you also see a little spider on

the wall that you think might make a

good future spell component with my hand

[Laughter]

do it Ferdinand any wipes it on the

lodger than the out bears a little beak

or something as you as you make your way

down the stairs

squidly than that than Jenks and Jenks

you always have a bit of problem with

stairs because sometimes your cloak is a

little ear your robe is a little bit

long and your if your feet get caught on

it and so you take yourself you take

yourself very seriously and delicately

down the stairs and but in the lead

squiggly with your dark vision you can

see that there is a cage set up in the

middle of what is basically a 20 foot

square room with several doors leading

off of it this cage is about eight feet

on a side made of wood with a with metal

rivets and corners and trim and what

looks like a wooden metal door set on

one side there's also a set of double

doors that fly open across the room and

you guys have basically just an instant

as you're standing on the staircase

across the room to try to maybe hide in

the shadows I'd like you all to roll a

d20 please all of us no Don you Jared

okay sixteen that's an eleven okay and

I'll roll for Holly all right all right

all these back Holly there we go thank

you

Holly Roy I got my props roll a d20 I

got five okay so

squiggly in that you duck into the the

you've sort of press yourself up against

the walls of the staircase but then you

see Jenks just basically coming down the

stairs and he just sort of freezes on

the staircase between you and he's an

obvious visual target during his height

what I did he says hide a nice just say

it louder hide okay Shh so he waves his

wand and where do you where do you hide

do you attempt to press yourself up

against the walls like NAT and squidly

are doing you're running back into the

darkness I don't think that I'll do as

good of a job as I'm gonna try you

squiggly is like hiding but also doing

like his own music all right now is

watching squiggly and and waiting for

like they have a special all-clear don't

know yeah cuz she she wouldn't be able

to hear what's going on she just would

have known to hide from yes emotion yes

and you also can see not as the double

doors open since you have the best view

from where you are that there are three

figures that come into the room the

first one to come through is a dwarf

with some tattoos on his brown skin the

curious thing about him is one of his

arms seems to have been lopped off and

replaced with a crossbow be hauntings

that's really cool be it is pretty cool

behind him you see that there is a woman

much taller stick like in frame and

she's got big red curly hair that falls

down over her shoulders and based on the

way she's dressed well I'll let you

interpret this as you will

she seems to be wearing what looks like

a soiled ball gown possibly a wedding

dress that has been probably just kind

of dragged or spent too long down here

in the sewers and has lost its proper

color and taken sort of an unsavory

shade to it but she's also dressed in

tall knee-high leather boots with high

heels and she sort of clops into the

room behind this dwarf wedding dress

with knee-high love yes yes yes and you

can see the the boots through a tear in

the side of the dress and then behind

them you see a man who must be at least

seven feet tall dressed in kind of like

a suit with a tweed vest an overcoat and

a hat over sort of a weirdly malformed

head and you can see he's a particularly

hairy man his arms are just covered with

hair and he is pulling or rather pushing

a baby carriage with its canopy up

shielding anything that might be in the

carriage from sight

and they stopped in front of the cage

and the woman reaches into her bust and

pulls out a key to unlock the cage door

and we haven't seen what's in the cage

there's nothing in the cage the cage is

empty but as she opens the door she pull

she holds out her other hand the a a

yellowish green hand sort of sticks out

of the baby carriage holding a twitching

fish and she grabs the fish and throws

the fish into or slides the fish into

the cage and then slams the door shut

he says I'm surprised we made it back in

time and then she darts looks at the

dwarf and she says that was too easy

he didn't even lock the doors there was

no knock spells I'm sorry there was no

arcane lock spells there were no glyphs

of warden I prepared my knock and my

dispel magic for nothing what a joke and

he says and the dwarf says yeah here's

you and your inevitable betrayal sorry

not signs she signs too squiggly like

what are they saying uh and you know

enough of her of the sign language she

taught you squiggly to respond in the

language oh I was gonna say like he very

crudely tries to respond just like they

said it's time to play butterfly sight

you sort of a you know squigglies bad

signing well enough disorder you can

make a d20 check to try to correctly

interpret I got it - okay it's a little

hard to see in the dark shadowy

staircase what he's doing and it's

possible he my

be improvising he said something about

brunch and she's really confused what

that has to do with any of this and at

that point the woman turns to the dwarf

and says and don't you think for one

minute I'm letting you off the hook

Nazca or gray I know what you're up to

you were consorting with the enemy and

he says no no that's not true

that's not true I was spying on them I

was spying on them that's what I was

doing there and she says look we i'm

very perceptive nothing slips by my

attention nazca are great and i'm

telling you right now you are lying to

me

you are lying to me and she says but I

will tell you what I will not report you

or snitch on you to tulip or any of the

others but I want something for my

silence he says what your room that's

right

I want your room my room in this

amethyst layer you bet you what why cuz

if you want to be pop I'm tired of being

on the outside looking in you want to be

powerful you got to be near power and

that's why I aim to do so you give me

your room

you're the key right he says uh not on

me

well okay then you better go get your

key because I want your room from my

silence

otherwise I'm gonna tell Big Daddy

eyeballs all about you and your

treachery at which point you are the

three of you see the fish turn into an

Al bear and it's in the cage and Jared

you'll be playing waffles you find the

cage is really really tight so your butt

is just sort of squeezed up against the

back bars of this thing and your face is

kind of pressed up against the door a

little bit which would be adorable if it

wasn't so sad right and the rest of you

see this this gray feathered al bear

monster appear in the cage

and when it appears the the dwarf kind

of instinctively kind of jumps because

he's very close and I said oh you bet

you better get away from the bar jinkx

is really excited because jinkx has an

owl bear familiar that's right

stuffed but he's like never I never seen

a real Albert for just one in pictures

and books and things no and he just like

Cass was like us aside aside for the

gods what during this muffles even like

in a tight yeah this space like is like

actually trying to bite at the bars

their beak and kind of pawing at it like

their limited movement when this happens

you can see the the cage door sort of

bangs in its frame but seems to hold

secure and the three of you hiding in

the staircase can see that there is a

big fat iron lock on the door that's

sort of holding it shut and even though

this big beast is kind of rattling

around in there it's not look the cage

looks pretty darn secure and she says to

the dwarf this doesn't hold I swear I'm

gonna hold you responsible somehow I

didn't even make the cage I don't care

he says I need to take these boots off

and then she looks at the the the big

tall hairy guy in the suit and says mud

rut you stay here and watch and then she

looks into the baby carriage and says

snack you stay here to be a good boy and

then she stomps out of the room and the

dwarf follows after her so now there's

just the tall hairy creature in the suit

and the baby carriage with whatever is

inside it I signed to jinx

at first I say put down your owl bear

and talk to me I can't understand you

when you hold the albear and try to sign

oh why is that

real albear in trouble uh she looks over

at the wheel real owl bear and he's

never again never seen him before and

he's just like he'll sign back so I'm

sure I think we all know yeah we all

know that yeah okay guys I think it's a

side and we should take a sign from who

I think it's just like my god she's like

Oh waffles

you can smell many smells in this place

there's the creatures near you there's

the crate there's the big guy there's

the creature in the in the in the

carriage and then you smell three more

creatures in the stairway which is sort

of darkened the light doesn't really

shine in there too well but you can make

out with your albear eyes three small

tasty little morsels but there there's

no sense here that waffles recognizes no

yeah so still just just kind of not yeah

the thing you discover is the bars don't

lend themselves well to non because

they're so tightly tight together so

you're just kind of scratching your beak

across the surface of them yeah and like

a dog who wants to go outside in the

back backyard and no but doesn't realize

that no matter how many times he paused

it'll never open the door waffles just

keeps mm-hmm just just right at it okay

yeah at that point the the big hairy

creature takes off his hat and you see

two big years come sticking out

triangular pointy ears and you see that

he had sort of a high collar up but now

he's sort of divesting himself of the

road of the cloak and just sort of

draping it over the the baby carriage

and waffles has seen these kinds of

creatures before has smelled them before

but wouldn't know what they're called

the rest of you can make a d20 roll to

see if you've ever seen creatures like

this big guy before six

3:18 alright the wizard you've seen her

you've seen you so you're when you're

when your mom and dad would read you

stories picture books and things like

that you would see pictures of these

creatures they are called bug bears and

bugbears are big hairy brutes with sharp

teeth and sharp claws and they're

smarter than they look squiggly just

like looks bag is like a yellowish

greenish skinned kind of bat nosed

pointy eared goblin crawls out of the

baby carriage and just sort of drops

down onto the floor and he sort of rips

a baby bonnet off his head and kind of

throws it down on the floor that's like

it's not a baby like what and as as he

says it sees the albear kind of nying on

the bars and whatnot you see this little

green goblin just start to gamble around

and make fun of the albear oh I hate a

bully Nadja's also does not like people

who make fun of people and then it's

like

- the albear that's like we're going to

cut his tongue off then he takes his

pants down he takes his pants down and

moons the al-bari squiggly replies now

like now okay now sir please scan

squiggly when you look you can see that

that bug bear is scary freakishly tall

and big and strong the Goblin you're not

gone ones actually smaller than you are

but that bug bear is like five of you I

don't care what does Goodley do best

squid Lee is gonna reach for their yep

he's gonna take a shot at the bigger one

because he's just like I like a good

challenge

- too late three all right

rolling rolling do twenty squiggly

dealing with literal children twelve all

right do bare right so you is your arrow

kind of sticks it and goes impales

itself through the felt hat that he's

holding in his hand and then he just

sort of holds it up and notices for the

first time there's an arrow sticking

through I'm like good shot squigglies

like that's a warning shot and then you

actually shout that out or you just yep

okay the bug bear kind of looks over

into the dark and focuses its beady eyes

in your direction and then it sort of

throws the hat on to the floor and comes

stopping stopping over to the three of

you so everybody on I'm not free

everybody roll initiative

disability all right let's roll

initiative you can't see be a man

visible for initiative just roll D 20s

and and I'll bear you can roll too just

for the sake of eight for net eighteen

eighteen for squiggly I got fifteen

fifteen for Jenks fifteen for waffles

all right as he's like stomping over

squigglies just like we're gonna kick

your ass and save that fish yeah you saw

them change that fish into a big monster

we got to change it back and bring it

back to the ocean all right the so

squiggly you were but you basically took

your shot on what was technically a

surprise round your turn comes around

again what do you do is the bug bear

lumbers toward you

is he like dawning on me how big this

thing really is yeah yeah he's like

approaching as he gets closer I keep

looking I'm just like hey you just

looked it he looks too now he's like

what do we do okay he's like okay I'm

gonna kick him in the shin come on up

and kick him in the shin alright so you

run up and he's actually very very tall

but you can get it you can get tuition

no problem there you sort of drop drop

kick him in the shin make a d20 roll

thirteen okay you bounce off him and

just sort of ow

after kicking him you're just like

standing now right in front of him

looking straight up at this glowering

creature and like this glob of drool off

one of his fangs fall and just splats

you in the eye squidly trying to be a

badass just like just like licks it off

his face fear okay yeah then it is whoa

oh it's the goblins turn

the Goblin he's not concerned at all

about pesky little

tiefling urgent person he sort of

reaches for the Hat and rips out the

arrow and just kind of tries to poke the

albear with it but only world of 12 to

attack which isn't really enough to get

through your beastly hide waffles least

I don't think so let me double check I

think so

yeah you are by one okay so he does not

get through your your natural hide but

he is trying to antagonize you all right

but now it is your turn waffles great I

want to bite his arm is he's trying to

poke me yeah that looking he's like

trying to poke through like just snap

with the beak right his hand okay you

won't be able to get because he's not

sticking any part of his arms into the

cage still that's what she does you

could try to bite off the arrow I think

she like trying to just snap like at him

no game I try to get to be through the

cage and okay through that hit the arrow

okay

like instinctively waffles was trying to

go for him and got it so just on pure

instinct she's going after him all right

I think like because of the logistical

projects get the arrow on it okay just

make an attack roll with your beak which

is plus 7 total 11 okay he's able to

snatch the arrow back as you as if

anticipating your hostile response and

suffers no ill effects all right and

then she'll just further keep smashing

against the cage okay

and jinx all right I of course see I'm

sure squidly has done this before oh yes

numerous yes usually with a butcher or

with some sort of broad Cryer but today

it's with a bugbear okay yeah I'll look

at my my towel very familiar and say

stamp back for then we're gonna cast a

really strong spell and I'm gonna I'm

gonna run down there and forget in front

of the

bugbear and say oh my name is Jenks but

I deficit and I'll take you down you

evil follow what are many shaking he's a

hundred percent shaking are you Carrie

are you casting any spells I would if I

have five in my mind I'm casting

fireball okay I don't have food all

right

so you utter your incantation that

you've come up with for spite fireball

where are you detonating it I don't know

how fireball works I'm a percent just a

just like whatever I think it's like a

ball like actual all right so you

conjure a ball of fire in your time with

your wand and the new helix right at his

face and it explodes and the fire just

sort of consumes his head so he's just

like a burning pumpkin head squiggly and

not you see none of this you just hear

the wild gesticulations you see Jenks

thrust his hand mightily at the creature

and then he starts you know huzzah but

the bugbear from your point of view

squidly doesn't looks just sort of

arches of bushy eyebrow up at the

spell-casting kid behind you and then

focuses back on you and it is the

bugbears turn next he is going to

attempt to grapple Oh y-you squiggly you

can just look at your little arrows and

go he's doing the mental algebra okay so

he is going to make a strength check

contested by your d20 role okay fifteen

okay

you managed to slip out of his grasp who

he reaches for you you leap to the side

he does not grab hold of you quick and

nimble and that is his action and

Matt that's like eyes locked on the

Goblin and she she tries to get his

attention and speak slowly so that he

will understand she says your but my and

she raises her sword and she goes after

him all right so you charge past the

bugbear who is too aggravated by squidly

to pay much mind to you when you run

toward the Goblin he's just standing

there with the little arrow in his hand

and you can make an attack role which is

just the d20 role for you these dice are

really not my friend today six okay you

just kind of clock him punk on he's

right he says tries to block you with

his arm so you just hit him across the

arm and he just says oh I don't that's

right you don't hear it but everybody

else does

totally he knows that she doesn't hear

it so he tries to yell louder like he

said ow and then it is that's the bottom

of the initiative order so we're back at

the top with squiggly you have moved

left to the side up the staircase a

little bit to get out of the grasp of

the bug bear what do you do I'm feeling

like especially like like like cunning

and like moving her around so I want to

try and like slip to the cage and I want

to try and save the fish okay you are

basically disengaging from the bug

baracy kind of tumble and run past him

you run over to the cage you see the big

giant owl bear filling up the cage you

see the lock on the door of the cage

what do you do when you get there I look

at the lock I'm like

 um did I wait who has the key so

you saw the woman take the key out of

her bodice mm-hmm she presumably still

has the key and is not in the room at

present is the only things in the room

at presents are the two monsters that

you're fighting the al bear and the cage

and the baby carriage

I want too so did is waffle stinking up

like the like literally just filling up

there are various space in there like a

a small person could probably squeeze in

there with this beast can I try to

squeeze in there yes do you want to

squeeze in toward the front end or the

back end of the monster front end I have

faith that this is a friendly monster

who knows that I'm trying to help it Wow

monster waffles is a fish okay make a

d20 roll to slip through the narrow bars

15 okay you squeeze your rail-thin body

you kind of get stuck your head gets

kind of stuck for a second then you

realize oh warns you turn and then just

sort of slip through and then find

yourself stuck in this cage with this

creature and every time it moves you're

sort of bashed up against the bars

looking flashed up against the bars

little so it's just like okay in here

you're pretty sure it's so tight in here

that she couldn't really attack you even

if she wanted to because yeah squidly

assesses for a second and looks around

and he's just like all right now what

you're not sure you could get out again

Frank really tries to get I just like to

fish man

the it's trying to talk to me I know it

the the goblins it's safe the Goblin is

gonna try to poke the albear again and

does not succeed

not even close and that will bring us to

waffles waffles you are aware of the boy

who is in this cage with you now I'll

protect you fish okay what did you say

the cage is made out of so it's iron

Rhian for reinforced with iron okay now

make a make an intelligence check for

waffles which will be for you a d20 roll

- four - four okay come on girl - four

equals three okay

what would waffles like to do well she

can't really reach squigglies at all she

could if she you know tried her best

yeah I mean all she can tell is that

he's trying to hug her it looks like she

knows hugs yeah but this goblin still

pissing her off so she's still just

trying to snap at that maybe biting at

the board's or trying to fog in sit as

hard as it can okay squiggly make an

intelligence check this is just a d20

roll for you six okay we're not sure

what the albear is trying to do but

every time she does it you you sort of

get rammed up against the bars in an

uncomfortable way ow all right Wow

waffles you you don't make any progress

at getting through the bars you do hear

the lock on the door banging as you as

the cage moves and gets jostled about

Jencks you can make an intelligence

check sixteen okay one of the things you

notice is that while the cage itself is

secure it is not secured to the floor

that whenever a waffles kind of throws

her weight up against it like the bottom

the floor almost comes up

it's sitting on the floor alright I am

going to run over there alright I would

like I would like you to make another

d20 roll actually makes those noise rod

running night team all right

you you're so good at this you don't

trip and fall over your robe as you get

to the other side of the cage used to my

fabulous wizard where yeah I think my my

biggest inspiration is Jim dark magic

[Laughter]

the dark magic books are your favorite

yeah

but Kay just isn't bolted to the ground

I'll cast the knock spell on it and then

you get out where to lift it up

what okay

yes the high lock nitrogen also sign it

yeah it's salt and I don't look at

waffles be we're gonna get you out of

there little lady

and I'm ugly like me just let him feel

proud of himself it's okay and so and

also hold up my my owl bear familiar and

say this is you Ferdinand this is you in

like a hundred years

yeah so waffles you kind of have some

sort of instinctual recognition that

what she's holding up to you is like a

baby Albert yeah yeah and I'll go I'll

go uh knock well tricks could you could

transform her staff into al bear

couldn't she yeah and two just like that

yeah yeah so I imagine there's some

familiarity there with ya holes yes

probably soothes her yes and it's waving

a little creature that there's waving a

wand around frantically in making words

and nothing is happening okay and then

it is the bug bear this turn so Enoch

didn't work they did not know no well it

actually from your point of view Jenks

you think that it may have caused the

the lock to open slightly like maybe it

could just now be turned invisible so

you think you think it is success on

some degree but then the bugbear turns

around realizes his quarry has escaped

sees this young girl

accosting the Goblin and comes over

behind her to try to grab her and you

have to make a strength or just roll a

d20 an ax to elude this hulking beast -

okay he grabs you and just sort of picks

you up in his in a kind of bear hug a

bugbear hug he's kicking her feet yeah

sword is kind of waving around with his

hands above your above it and so and

then he just cries out I got her I got

her she's trying to kick him okay

and it is your turn so you can try to

finagle your way out if you like she

tries to kick him in the step like in

the stomach or the knee or wherever her

feet are okay she tries to just like

donkey kick him back right with the goal

of getting free I assume yes yeah nine

okay Wow you are successful and he drops

you and you just land on your feet like

a cat in front of him and yeah he he

clutches his gut where he took the kick

why I don't have movement after that

doing yes you do because that was just

an action I'm gonna try to get back

toward the rest of my party because they

might need my help the leader okay mm-hm

you don't have far to go it's only a few

feet to get to Jenks who's on the back

side of the cage squidly I see has

letí's in the cage and I don't have any

other action though no you used your

action to escape that's it yep

so I just take a defensive stance yeah I

saw it right but you can communicate as

a free action so you can do that anytime

you want to

I just say hey alright and now it is

back to squiggly she's like pressed up

like I really didn't think this through

maybe I should start doing that he says

that every time but not today I'm gonna

try to what can I even do like Jax has

told you that the the lock is really

weak now and could come undone at any

moment so get ready for that and you

know he told you about the the cage is

sort of getting heaved around it's not

fixed to the floor okay can I like maybe

try it I'm so tiny I can't knock this

cage over no you almost certainly can't

um I guess I'll try to get my way back

out okay make another d20 rule to get

your way back out 18 alright you are

actually successful and you plop outside

the cage just as I planned

now we're all here what do we do what do

we do did you learn anything from your

reconnaissance in the cage

what reconnaissance spying area oh

you're doing you're doing peace signs

recon oh nice okay cool she looks at him

non plus she's like I teach you this

every day yeah you've had good luck

you've had lesson time an hour a day on

purpose she does hiss I'm just like yeah

it's almost brunch do can I do anything

else nope you can help you've done quite

enough snake the Goblin at this point

realizes that you guys are danger

because you kicked the bug bear in the

gut

bugbears clearly been hurt you see he'll

throw the arrow down on the ground

and he that he pulls out a little Club

and comes up behind squidly and just

tries to leap up and crack him on the

back of the head with it you know what

you had it coming all right

but he rolled a eight which is not high

enough so squidly you see this goblin

fling himself upon you and you kind of

moved to the side and he just sort of

lands on the ground having hit nothing I

like to imagine like he didn't try to

dodge it just as he was coming down

squidly saw something shiny he's just

like oh yeah goblin goes over squigglies

fine but you notice that the Goblin is

has got this billy club out essentially

and just tried to clock you with it and

then it is waffles turn how close is the

Goblin in relation to the cage oh about

you know three feet away okay but I was

like attacking these other children it

has this little waffle bear pet but yes

okay so waffles again sees familiarity

from like the spell-casting and the

little waffle where pet is getting a

little more sanity don't forget heart

and the insanity and the fact that none

of them are very successful at anything

they're doing waffles feels at the as

like familiarity and come home this with

this so she kind of goes it's like a

waffles rage and trying to get through

the case you get them okay so like what

sort of limited movement is rather than

like just pong it's most like a full-on

like leap head but putting all of her

weight into outside yeah Oliver wait

like backing up as much in cage the cage

and will he be forward with like your

back legs all right make a strength

check for the al bear which is going to

be your role +5 o 18 okay

the the al bear goes crazy and throws

its weight up against one side of the

cage and the entire cage just like a die

tipping

/ basically comes over squiggly I need

you to make a a roll a d20 okay this

could be funny 18 okay you see the cage

coming down on top of you and the Goblin

you turn sort of sideways and the bars

just go right over you so that you're

back in the cage again that's good

like Schooley doesn't even see anything

just crashes it's like domino lucky just

like us and then you're stuck well in

the cage with the owl bear again but the

entire cage is now on its side well this

is way better and the rest of you see

the goblin just get crushed under the

bars and waffles you're just sort of on

top of the squelched Goblin she's next

on it a little bit use the rest of you

see her sort of reach down through the

bars with her beak and pull out like

just a big long whip of sinew and tissue

and other goblin matter she's like good

riddance

yeah those waffles just like doing like

a handstand or headstand yes she is now

headfirst down on the floor eating this

goblin the cage door is on its side up

in the air beside her its lock sort of

hanging now at an odd angle the bug bear

is like holy crap psyche snake and it is

jinxes turn alright well knock didn't

work so I think what I'm gonna do is oh

yeah I'm levitate we have to get the

hell out of there like what do you it's

the float or push it or something and

I'll be like I'll levitate okay you

start to cast the spell and when you

realize the cages

it's because it's way too heavy you

underestimated the heaviness of this the

spell while you can levitate you know

your friends or like an apple or

something this is just too big and the

fizzles out on you all right well I'm

doing it though I'm in front of I'm in

front of the owl bear holding my owl

okay and I'm going levitate levitate

don't like like like look and so I'm

just it pretty much looks like I'm

coaxing the owl bear to knock the cage

over okay so then we can get out and

make a d20 roll for me jinx okay 15 you

can hear outside the room past the

double doors which are closed at the

moment you can hear the clop clop

clopping of boots oh no it sounds like

it sounds like that woman oh no do I see

anything that I can put in front of the

door Bob's back no I mean there's

there's the baby carriage but it's it

doesn't look like it's got a lot of

resistance like it like it there's not

enough weight to it to really hold the

door shut okay well I'm gonna run over

to the door after holding it over up

okay and I'm in my mind I'm casting

disguise self okay and I'm gonna stand

by the door and just wait wait okay so

Jenks just sort of bodily puts presses

himself up against the door and and just

sort of make some sort of arcane just

stick ulation as he does so and then it

is let's see

bump bump bump um the bugbears turn the

bugbear eye he might still be alive he

starts to drag the the cage over trying

to get it off his friend and as he does

the goblin just sort of smears across

and the bug bears like I always thought

I'd go first he just sort of drags this

cage maybe like two feet because it's so

heavy with the al bear inside

and that's all that he can muster and

then when he realizes he's just made it

even worse and created this smear where

the Goblin used to be he's like now I'm

really angry oh I'm so angry now it's

like that's why you don't mock people

and you hear who you hear a voice

outside the door say what the hell's

going on in there

I told you to watch the albear what are

you give me where's that teeth

squealing goes nothing everything's fine

and then that's the bugbears turn NAT

NAT will try to the door of the cage is

still accessible right is yes you could

just sort of have to climb up a couple

bars to get to it she's gonna try to

unlatch or break the door okay how is

she going what is she going to do

exactly so you have it you have a door

in its frame with a big padlock hanging

off its latch yeah does the bugbear have

any visible like weapons or tools that's

a good question um you can see that you

see no obvious weapons on the bugbear

and given the way he's dressed you think

he was probably quote-unquote disguised

so that he could maybe pass for a very

tall man in the city

so he wouldn't have been carrying

anything too big and brawny if he was

trying to pass himself off as a water

Davian and I don't have anything like

lock picks or anything like that

you don't um but make a d20 roll this is

sort of an intelligence check for you 13

it's possible the Goblin did and maybe

he hid them in the carriage she's gonna

do something super cool like run jump on

the carriage and ride it into the cage

okay

at least she thinks it looks cool

alright yeah and then you know search

search inside there and see if there's

anything all right make a d20 roll to

ride the cage this is sort of an

acrobatics 11 okay you are successful in

doing so and you can see that there is a

monitor a canopy to the cage that you

can kind of roll back and as you it

looks like there's a baby blanket in

there and all kinds of stuff but

underneath the blanket you can see that

yes in fact the Goblin has hidden some

gear in there and a lot of it looks like

the kind of thing you'd expect a like a

burglar to have like if they're gonna

break into a house I hold it up and show

the others cool do I still have movement

left if I like slid on the yeah you do

cool so if I can use the rest of my

movement to get to the door I'll try to

apply these fuse tools to the lock okay

or break it since you can pick up an

item as a sort of a free action on your

turn doesn't cost you anything to grab

the tools so yes you can make your way

back over to the door and try your

darndest and you don't have you know a

ton of time in your 6 seconds so you

kind of pull a tool out that you think

might be good at jimmying this big lock

[Music]

and just make a d20 roll as you finna go

laughing okay to your surprise thanks in

part to jinx is magic you reckon the

lock pops open

she looks shocked for a second she's

like hahaha and then she's like I mean

and you sort of unclasp it and you throw

it aside and then you can just sort of

let the door fall open and waffles you

hear this big door clanged open on one

side she makes it she she makes a grand

motion like after you want to take

yourself out the bugbear shouts they

open the cage the open air

and nothing's open it is squiggly Stern

squiggly you are in the

age with said albear and the door just

opened

yes it's on the far side of the out

there all right I'm gonna like just like

try and like climb over okay yeah ad 20

roll to climb over the albear 17 you are

successful and you can squirt out of the

cage door cool um next in that is that

that's pretty much all I can do huh yeah

it's probably all your movement will

allow you could probably you could try

to attack something uh as squidly was

like coming out I'm guessing it's like a

like a really really tiny like drop out

of the door mm-hmm

just he he looks at he just like oh oh

Kiril landing okay and he like does this

really sad little hero landing and then

looks up like he's all cool yeah

and he sort of saw she sort of flaps his

cape a little bit behind him jinx like

jinx is up against the door like didn't

did both of them observe the superhero

landing squigglies looking for like like

affirmation just like yeah and yes

yeah Jenks you can hear that there's the

rail-thin woman putting her you know

shoulder to the door trying to get it

open do I see the door to be opened yes

yes that looks for Jenks and sees that

Jenks is holding the door because she

didn't hear any of that

right yeah she sees him like yeah good

like this and she's like oh no okay

squeeze like don't worry I got this and

he just shoots in here do it make a d20

roll for your attack against the door 15

okay the the arrow decide six in the

door next to Jenks his head I imagine

what these arrows usually don't even

like embed in anything again she's like

nice shot

it took one here like one of those like

whistling like that home it's also it's

also very uh Jenks you know it's also

very sort of soft rotted spongy wood so

yeah

well jinx jinx is now now that waffles

is free shanks is going to try and make

eye contact with waffles and Cass speak

with animals all right whatever he

doesn't know

well like I could speak to you where is

your home beautiful creature not your

turn yet

Cass the spelling your turn waffles

yes his waffles aware that there's now

this open door or unhinged side or what

a mess so from like her face-planted

yeah

whatever she's just gonna like she sort

of yeah she can shift their weight or

push her back hindquarters out first and

then sort of back her way out of the

door you know and basically do that to

kind of crawl or yes adorably fall out

and then when she gets out she sort of

shakes yeah some feathers go flying yeah

and then as soon as she's out it's a

full-on waffle bear rage at the bug bear

all right go ahead do you think this is

like the full ferocity is that waffles

has learned from her 50 years of strix

nice so you three kids see this creature

just go crazy

oh so Jenks you're about to cast your

spell you're like yeah and so al bear

you get to make two attacks a beak

attack at plus seven and the claws

attack at plus seven is it one claw -

it's both plaza or one attack so okay so

we'll say this one this beak this one is

claws plus seven for both yeah it's a 23

for claws and 24 B can you hit with both

yeah so your beak will do one be ten

plus five I never get to roll one D ten

yeah beak it's for seven and your claws

will do 2d eight plus five

well this is excited I'm rolling died I

never get you yay

and the beaks or the claws do twelve so

19 total all right that blood ease the

bug bear and not like has her sword out

and she's trying to look all menacing

and as soon as this happened it just

like drops like to her side which is

like

the first time seeing an actual creator

do anything you saw this bit you see

this big lumbering behemoth just sort of

throw itself at the bugbear knock him

down on to the stairs and just start

tearing clothes and flesh away from his

body now it's like one of those kids

that like should be horrified by a

horror movie but is like cool squigglies

like watching from the back doing things

like yeah alright and then it is jinxes

turn alright does the same same thing

except more scared like Bloods flying

everywhere like where is your home speak

to me alright

the it does not so waffles you hear one

of the kids calling out but you don't

know you're too busy tearing up this bug

bear they're all buffle says is so Jenks

you take that to mean whatever you want

it to me just like it wants us to ride

it you can it wants us to what get on

the back but he'll make a run for it -

oh yes waffles is done with the bug

bereted jump or stride jump on his back

actually or her back wall she's actually

you're not doing that now are you gonna

do that now Oh jinkx is gonna like try

and keep it on her back down okay so as

soon as you run away from the door they

open up behind you oh no and you can see

that woman standing there and she has a

wand out ah if I look at if I look at

her I immediately hold my doubt in my

size Oh Wizards doll you turn around did

you point your crooked wand over all

right with Ferdinand tucked under your

arm look you're a pacifist the woman

says

there's the spells today but I still add

McCain trips should be enough to take

care of you you little fatso

[Laughter]

can not read lips well enough to you see

that she calls him yes yes

she's like and then she actually fires a

beam of frost from her wand and Jenks

you

you've never been yeah you're like you

start to wave your wand around okay

right defend me for amend all right yes

so the frigid beam of blue-white light

streaks toward you is she has to make

arranged spell attack all right she she

hits you or rather hits Ferdinand you

see ice form over your familiar and as

its as it forms over the familiar and

covers your hand Jenks your hand gets so

cold and numb that you have to kind of

drop Ferdinand on the ground and you see

you see Ferdinand lying dead on the

floor covered in ice staring up at you

quick retaliate with meteor storm looks

like it looks like your your counter

spell protected you but it couldn't

protect Ferdinand in time okay alright I

need like doing all kinds of crazy

gestures yes

this is a particularly powerful spell

for you so roll a d20

[Laughter]

okay as you start to incant this

horrible horrible spell you can see the

rest of you see everybody sees this

woman go I'm having a piece of that and

she ducks around the corner and Jenks

you open your eyes and she is gone and

then it is the bugbears turn the bugbear

doesn't have any weapons so all he is

going to do is make an unarmed attack to

defend himself against the al bear who

called brother yeah this is going to be

13:8 so he's actually going to hit with

his unarmed attack and he does a

whopping three points of damage which

I'll keep track of for you thank you

as he just pounds with his fists

the al bear in the side of the head and

it only seems to incite the beast

further I'm sure yeah further waffles

rage yep and then he helps us outs I'm

coming I'm coming and then it is Matt's

turn do I think that the woman

disappeared because of the spell no she

just you saw her literally just jump to

the side I guess to take hiding yes I

think that she since she saw that lady

called Jencks fatso she's now like I

thought so she advances with her sword

drawn as you advance you actually get up

to Jenks who's standing there looking at

his frozen al bear familiar I say I'm

sorry yeah but you know she puts a hand

on her heart just to remind them that

you know we're here together and she's

like also that lady

sucks is bad fashion sense I'm gonna

cutter thank you I go stab right now all

right go ahead to the hall you you poke

you poke your head out into the hall NAT

and you can see the woman has sort of

thrown herself up against the side of

the door out of the way of whatever

horrible magic might come from that

little kid but you can also see at this

point in time she's saying nasca gosh go

get your fat would last over here and

she is mean and she's calling out to

some dark chamber behind her that you

can't quite see NAT because the torch

light from the chamber you're in does

not extend out into the hall that far so

but you can hear Nazca say I'm coming

I'm coming

and then she's standing there well well

well what do we have here this little

trollop Jennifer Amy can I can I get to

her and make an attack yeah you can I

want to smack the wand out of her hand

with my sword okay make it why are you

so mean all right you smack it make an

attack role but d12 okay you knock the

wand out of her hand and it clatters

down on the floor and she says why am I

so mean my little dear I put the ice in

nice she says and if you if your future

husband left you at the altar

you'd be mean to something look forward

to husband she tries to grab the water

run away okay let's see picking up an

item is a free action for you so you can

grab it and run away she goes and come

back here you little all right

those are all Universal signs yes

and you can see that her wand is this

black stick with a little crystal at the

top of it and shake it around alright

whatever you imagine it does it does but

it's just your imagination and then it

is goblins dead

I should really cross him out um

squiggly you seen that has the woman's

wand hell yeah she's running around a

bit like I'm gonna try and ride the

albear alright I just make a d20 role to

clamour up on to the raging beast 12 you

are successful yeah Here I am

yep you're up there I'll waffles you

obviously know about mauling two steers

like him

so you're probably like yeah I'm

controlling Awful's this yeah yeah you

see that waffles from waffles point of

view over her shoulder her tearing into

this bloodied up bug bear he like looks

over see he's like yeah alright and you

still have an attack action Oh

oh shoot okay and as you as you sort of

look around engage your surroundings

you've got the bug bear down below you

and behind you the woman comes back into

view and she's with that dwarf with the

crossbow arm so now mounted atop my new

steed and I'm gonna do a from animal

back arrow shot Oh cuz I feel so cool

down at the bug bear no yeah yeah back

at the at the at the lady

alright shot go ahead and make another

d20 room I like one to reach for an

arrow and I just like I like pulled out

nothing but didn't realize oh

this is how you lost your one eye

actually this is why you worry this is

why you wear an eyepatch

mmm-hmm

okay and then after that spectacular

failure waffles

yeah still Mallen okay plus seven both

imagine I like to imagine he has him

like she hasn't like pinch pinch down to

the ground yeah and just like clawing at

that round and him yep Destin's are in

there somewhere

17 and 16 for beacon o'clock okay two

hits yeah so D 10 plus 5 2 D 8 plus 5

all right

so peak is 13 okay and and the claws are

14 all right you bite his face off and

you rip him in half bits of entrails go

splattering all over the staircase up

the walls she flings something over her

back it flies past you squidly he

realizes like one of the bug bears ears

and that is that the bug bear is dead -

waffles is there any kind of anywhere it

looks like she can use to escape through

like a tunnel or something so at the top

of the stairs is a door that looks like

it's hat it's it's handles have been

ripped off at some point like it's a

handle been torn off just to create a

hole and it's just kind of hanging open

so there's there's actually some sort of

hallway at the top of this staircase

okay does it look like waffles could fit

through it though oh yeah okay

and she knows she's got something on his

back yeah she knows it's the little guy

yeah so waffles will cost quickly

saunter up next to you Jenks and just

kind of like it's kind of crouched down

and just kind of and like lower herself

squidly thinks he's like controlling the

elevator does it on their own accord I'm

just like hop on you can see that

Ferdinand's already thawing a little bit

so yeah his corpse is fine and waffles

get well we animate them yeah

well this is a heartwarming coup to

jinxing they're just okay it's a really

hard bloody nose they make it makes that

little Koontz Whitley's like I think

it's threatening you better watch out

NAT shows the wand

look what I gave you huh I'll be on

granny hands it alright yeah you grab it

all right so that's waffles and next up

is Jenks so you can grab the wand blink

yes what do you do next jinx I'm gonna

get on top of waffles make a d20 roll

ten okay you do yeah you climb up office

probably has to help a bit it's like no

you're you're actually surprisingly

agile for a wizard my robes are so long

yeah yeah you manage it no problem

whatsoever all right

waffles waffles feels the weight of the

added part of the added person but it's

it's no more than you know you can bear

a lot more can I see if the wand is like

does anything when I point it

what do you try to make it do well I saw

it cast a cold spell so I'm just like

you're gonna try to do that kind of call

the missile and you're trying to direct

it at anything in particular just up at

the air just where that lady went she's

standing in the doorway again now so

yeah her okay you point the wand make a

d20 roll 18 okay a beam of blue cold

shoots from the tip of the wand and and

hits her and you see ice just sort of

blasts in her face the rest of you see

nothing

he just waves the lot around makes us

zap it makes a resort sound and

Cheers nice you're frozen you can't move

for a while I got a good yeah okay and

then it is oh he's dead he's dead so it

is her turn you can see alright

she rolls up her sleeves of her worn

wedding dress or gallon or whatever

she's wearing she cracks her knuckles no

more can trips for you little

and reinsert lips and goes language and

then you can see she's about to bust out

a spell and the dwarf sort of pulls her

back and says you don't want to mess

with that el bair we got to get some

reinforcements then we'll get them and

he reaches in and pulls the doors shut

what are you doing I'm dare you no no no

this is this is well they're not going

anywhere

let's go get some reinforcements they

start to have an argument out in the

hall perfect and then it is he's only

got one hand too so he probably has to

pull one door shut and then the other

door shut and when he pulls the other

door shut the last thing he does is he

sort of looks at you NAT and mouthed

something and I can I yes read it yes he

says leave while you can

I will delay her as much as possible

basically is what he's trying to

communicate she she gives him a an

adventurers understanding nod right

which she's totally done before totally

totally done before but now you hear

them arguing outside and I don't it

that's right everybody else does can

just just on the other side of the doors

getting into a screaming match and the

woman's basically shouting you

underestimate my magical powers I'm a

harp hell and we have magic behind your

comprehension God you dwarves are so

stupid and then he says I've seen what

that albear can do you won't get a spell

off before it rips your lips off and

rips your heart out and probably tears

your head off and do we hear all this oh

yeah the doors are like rotting doesn't

and that doesn't but you do Wow squiggly

here's the describing of the Al Barry's

like like looking back at him and then

the dwarf says and if you think these

dwarves are gonna or these doors are

gonna hold it probably should think

twice about that we should we should go

are we still in the initiative yes we

are and it is now down to

[Music]

nuts turn I skip squiggly sorry squiggly

what do you uh

squiggly just tells gnat just like get

on let's go

okay she runs and she tries to do a cool

like Li P thing um up on to the albergue

but she's also gonna like try to push

squiggly back so that she can drive

right okay make a d20 roll wait what

thirteen

all right you succeed you hop on land

three push push squiggly back into the

second-ranked position yeah and then you

sort of grab hold of the albear and sort

of waffles you can feel this girl

tugging on it

she's a natural are you two children

fighting for the leader position not so

much fighting she seems to have won yeah

we all know I'm the leader and after

that what do you do gnats once you're on

and you you have the driver seat I try

to go back from whence we came okay

waffles you feel like you're being

directed oh yeah so with that there's no

there's all on them yeah again I learned

behavior from living with Strix and

Simon alright

so you go up the stairs you go through a

door you come to a wall a dead end but

that the kids know is the secret door

that they found so they're able to lead

you out there into the swamp or not the

swamp the sewer okay and you go

splooshing down the sewer with them on

your back now Nats Quigley and Jenks you

know that you kind of usually come into

the sewers at this point through a very

narrow passageway that leads into the

cellar of a halfling house but you know

the waffles are the albear is not going

to be able to fit down the narrow

opening so you kind of have to continue

down the sewers and find another way out

eventually you guys come to a great that

waffles can basically push open with her

sheer bulk what she did cuz she learned

from iron exactly yes this is this is

manageable tech for her and so she

pushes her way out through the great

some will say she has proficiency

exactly into an alleyway a cobbled

alleyway which contains a low foggy mist

and as you guys sort of run your way

through the alleyway you hear the

maniacal clatter of a carriage and

wheeling in front of you coming around

the corner so sharply that it comes off

its wheels on one side before writing

itself is a black handsome pulled by a

horse and on that the reins of the

hansom is that crazy woman is a and you

can see that there are in the hansom

four goblins with bows or yep she's

riding on the back with the reins and

these crazy goblins are all stuffed in

the hansom with their bows getting

loading up to fire and take waffles down

okay

is this uh as our only direction through

them nope I'll it goes two ways and it's

crooked as all so it's not there's

not like a straight Ally it's like this

crooked up down up a few stairs down a

few stairs around buildings kind of a

gotcha okay basically everything is

happening on your turn now waffles oh

okay I guess bottles will not what she's

back outside numbers first he's gonna

try to do like fine sense to find her

way back home right and then we'll you

can make a basically a survival check

which for you will be just believe a

wisdom check sure because I don't think

I don't think I'll bears have the

survival skill do not so it's plus one

on your roll all right Ken

that is enough to sort of get your

bearings on where where you are in the

city all right yeah well then you're in

the trades ward which is south of where

you live

yeah waffles will then like kind of just

turn around and just well I kind of

start sprinting away just get away from

them and just trying to find the cents

and through their while well carrying

this the three children on her back okay

you also light it like doesn't yeah

they're they're all very very light as

the albear bolts away from this Hansen

which comes charging after it I'd like

the three kids to make d20 rolls to hang

on to the back of this leaping growling

beast oh gosh and also nine okay

I don't read yep so how am I still

babysitting so at one point you sort of

you leap down some stairs you deke

around a turret that sort of sticks out

into this alleyway the stairs sort of go

down at regular intervals around this

torrid before continuing on its way

through the alley the way the coach

driven by the crazy lady comes barreling

down the stairs after you slamming into

walls and suddenly NAT you feel the

weight lightened on your back as nat

goes tumbling off completely and just so

like i was leaning forward like yeah

let's go let's go yeah right over and

just sort of goes tumbling into some

soft trash squidly will like instantly

be like oh and just jump after her

okay

squidly dives off into the trash after

her holes and it's like this is my

purpose yes you crawl up to the front

Jencks finally you're holding on to the

scruff of waffles neck while your

friends are in the trash oh my gosh I

missed the opportunity to call it an at

one Oh

yeah all right ice whatever Big B's hand

all right you saw yelling stuff things

happen in your mind Jenks walls go up

fiery you know what's really cool yeah

it all looks get in your mind nothing

really happens though good waffles uh

turn around and I started making already

back towards the other you know were the

ones that fell off mm-hmm yep -

whichever creature looks like has a

harder time holding on to her she'll try

to like pick up with her beak okay and

then like let the other just kind of

grab on to her before she will take off

again all right so the al bear comes

over to you

grabs which one you want to grab with

the beak uh we'll see squiggly okay

squiggly you're picked up in this

thing's beak oh that way you can still

shoot your bow you hear it's like you

hear the the battered black handsome

clattering behind you and you know which

by the way in my head I'm absolutely

picturing just like Cruella De Vil like

doing like the crazy yeah look chase

after the Solow bear pretty much yeah

and they can't get line of sight on you

though because the it's the the alley is

so curved and twisty at this point gnats

do you want to try to throw yourself

back onto its back or grab on yeah all

right just make another d20 roll for me

she tries to just like do it cool I roll

an eight that's not so bad

that's fine but she what she tries to do

is do it cool like cowboy you know like

grab and flip over onto the top but what

you end up doing is kind of just like

awkwardly dragging next to it kind of

running or at least grab gotta have

running off scrabbling hole trying to

hold on all right you guys

trundle past what looks like a parked

apple cart with no horse or anything

attached to it and that as you're sort

of running alongside trying to keep up

on this thing

you do have to kind of move to the side

not to collide with this parked cart but

it's not that hard

Can I grab an apple make a detour oh 17

you totally do I do I do like a cool

Adam looking thing and tossed it up to

jinx okay it sort of ballet bounces

objects his head into waffles is running

for the alleyways and streets like like

doing some like pure like water deep

drifting yeah it actually makes like

skin sly on her paws before like kind of

running him down a little bit sort of

cutting down a long view down an alley

and then this Albers are sort of slides

into the alley stirring up dust then

comes charging toward us yeah four

arrows go flinging by none of them get

close enough to hit you and then you

bolt out into a crowded morning street

and there are coaches and double-decker

horse-drawn buses basically being pulled

Criss crossing up and down this street

that you just sort of bolt into so

quickly just starts yelling just like

scuse me please because you're riding in

albear pretty much everybody who can get

out of the way does get out of the way

but waffles you sort of run out into the

flow not not motions to jinx and

squiggly and she's like she's activating

a plan that they have like one of their

signature group moves and she's like do

the poor children routine oh no like and

this is something we do where it's like

people are chasing us and it's like woe

is us poor innocent children being

chased by a bad guy that yeah yeah we're

just trying to take this out there to

the sanctuary

oh try to stop us in fact it was in a

circus and there's the circus owners

while these creatures on your back are

just chattering away waffles what are

you doing I'm still here the danger

coming up behind you out of the alley

yeah still moving forward again in a

general direction back to wherever home

is yeah yeah but she's barreling forward

she tried to avoid like people in cars

because she's not like our ruckus and

she's been trained to not cause problems

right this is a fairly Main Avenue so

there is a lot of room for you to

navigate between it's not it's not like

tight quarters or anything this is a

very very wide a Boulevard

so you dart past people people's heads

jerk when like do double takes when they

see you with these three turns riding on

your back trundling forth and then you

hear screaming I'm gonna run you all

over you bastards get out of my

goddamn way

my old man's getting away yes I bought

those puppies right and then waffles you

smell something familiar nearby and it's

Strix

yeah I would also accept food miss

tricks is good

there's also food okay lots of food all

around you sense sense of food all

around you and you deke down a road to a

gigantic statue that rises 90 feet up in

the air or surrounded by the buildings

of the city this looks like you know the

city has kind of built itself around

this gigantic statue and you kind of

clamor up to one of its feet all right

and try to catch the air again you're

kind of on a street corner at this point

that handsome that is following you you

can see a bunch of city guards start to

come out and try to slow it down slash

cordon it off and

the woman realizing that she has nowhere

to go all of you just see her cast a

spell and she disappears like turns

invisible did you do that magic

the goblins in the hansom tried to

scatter but you're not sure how

successful they're gonna be given where

they are out in the morning Street

waffles continues to make her way

towards Strix --is okay scent well-liked

cooing out for her the rest of you can

hear now so now this creature you're

riding on this big creature just has it

slowed down you can see that the danger

has been stopped by the city watch and

that handsome is not in any danger of

catching up to you at this point but now

the albear seems to be prowling around

and giving off these strange noises what

did the three of you do guys I think

it's dying

yeah what else could that noise mean can

I try and ascertain what is doing sure

make a d20 roll you think she's caught a

familiar scent and is tracking it all

right and you sent you since just the

way she's shivering under you now you

sense that there's this incredible

anticipation okay and as she comes

through and the crowd parts ahead you

see three figures a trash which a woman

with fluttery boots in the air wearing

gleaming armor her hair perfect and this

this dashing cloaked dark-haired figure

billet with his cloak billowing

dramatically behind him evylyn Asterix

paltin you are now confronted by waffles

who has three children

her back and as waffles approached she

like it's like full speed until she like

as close as possible and then it's like

immediate like not quick a sudden stop
