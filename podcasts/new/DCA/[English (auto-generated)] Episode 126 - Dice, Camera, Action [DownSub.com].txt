hi everybody welcome to dice camera

action

[Music]

before we jump in I would like to

welcome our guest stars today Rachel and

Erica those of you who watch the show

familiar with Rachel she'll be reprising

her her role as Miranda but Erica is

playing a mystery character who will be

revealed momentarily

so the scariest when that happens it's

fine it's fine it's fine I'll just pop

out and yell surprise then you'll know

yeah

Miranda the elf druid acquired the ring

of winter and bore it away from the

waffle crew with the aid of to shatter

Kai assassins and made their way by

coach to the distant city of gloom rot a

dismal Victorian style coastal city in

the shadow fell convinced that the

shadow kai were sociopaths

Miranda ditched them and retreated to a

convent run by shadow kind nuns who had

taken a vow of silence

using the library in the convent she

began researching a means to destroy the

ring of winter while keeping the

artifact hidden from the nuns about a

month later stifled by life in the

convent

Miranda stole several books and

retreated to an abandoned house in the

Moors and over the course of another

month succumbed to what sages call

shadow felt despair this overwhelming

pervasive sense of gloom that is

inescapable that you just sink deeper

and deeper

- like quicksand isolated and lonely she

used the ring to create an ice construct

that she named Gwyneth the ring trying

to impress Miranda imbued the construct

with sentience and life

Miranda didn't fall for the Rings

seduction but she adored

Gweneth this woman of ice who is immune

to the shadow fell despair Miranda and

Gwyneth returned to gloom rot to break

into a library and steal more books from

Miranda's research but they had trouble

accomplishing this goal by themselves

but were befriended by an out-of-work

shadow Kai parlor magician named zolto

Ming grazi also known as the amazing

Ming grazi as he liked to refer to

himself who used his magic to help them

acquire the books that they needed

Miranda's research finally bore fruit as

she learned the secret to destroying the

ring unfortunately she needed the ring

to keep Gwyneth from melting putting her

in a bind Miranda decided that Gwyneth

was more important to her than the rings

destruction

despite Gwyneth's best efforts to lift

her friends spirits Miranda's despair

seemed to be getting worse and worse

Miranda couldn't shake the fear that the

Raven Queens agents would soon be upon

them which leads us to the present

Miranda and Gwyneth decided at last to

leave the shadow fell to flee with

zalto's help with agents of the Raven

Queen bearing down on them zolto led

Miranda and Gwyneth back to gloom rot

and they're in a vast cemetery dug up a

grave and turned it into a portal all of

this happening under the watchful eye of

a blood-red wolf moon

that's when zolto betrayed Miranda he

snatched the ring turned invisible and

disappeared through the portal dropping

into the grave Miranda and gwennyth

pursued the portal closing behind them

Strix you are in the kitchen

experimenting with your good berry

healing pie recipe yeah it worked no no

you're you're you're experimenting

you're doing it for basically for the

first time so you've prepared the pie

and you've sort of put it in the oven to

see how it's coming out and you're just

sort of staring at the at the baking pie

watching it every second to see what

happens now that happens a lot yes

you're up in your room sitting on your

bed looking down the bed at the chest

sitting on the middle of the floor

gazing at it longingly since you had a

chance to inspect it a little bit more

closely you did notice that there was a

very small itching into the what do you

call them the iron reinforcements that

help bind the wood together yeah and it

says poor thieves try as you might

this chest shall remain sealed tight

evylyn you are having a splendid dream

of your childhood cradled in the the the

arms of your father as a young girl just

gently kind of swaying or rocking it is

only some time later when you awake with

a start and it isn't you that's rocking

but the ship that you're on you are in a

bed covered with purple silken sheets

and beautiful silk pillows with a

beautiful gold tasseled canopy above you

and there's a portal on one curved wall

and you suddenly remember that you are

aboard Jarl axel ship and you are

currently waking in his bed that's all

just fell asleep here paltin you're in

my fields from that recap yes I am good

you are tuning your lute the lutes that

the Harper agent matram Merrick told you

was being used by the Harper's as a

listening device or an eavesdropping

device to nimma lute yes and there is a

there's a crowd of people gathered at

the yawning portal to hear the the

dulcet strums of paltin sapa local

legend a

I've talked enough anybody anybody want

to do something talking specifically to

the waffle crew right now I'm bout to

put on a hell of a show all right yeah

is would you say Simon is with you or

not for this absolutely he is I'm gonna

give them absolutely by the way you can

you could by now have trained hand-drew

to also play the instrument or help you

play the instrument so you can drink a

beer while stringing the instrument and

still have your other hand now would

only make it way more impressive right

yeah obviously clearly cool so so Han

drew will be will be will be on the neck

a bit while I'm strumming and just

downing wine and what's what's not kit

can I give Simon like little like a

little like finger cymbals yeah yeah

absolutely

cool yeah he'll he'll do those he's good

at those anything anything work she can

just click or bash he's really good at

sweet all right yes yes yes I like to

imagine that Strix is not is just

something she's just staring at this pie

it's maybe willing it to be yes sir I'll

be sort of drifts into frame and just

sort of floats next to your head and

sting she goes like this it floats back

and he just stares at the pie with you

and he's he's salivating can always give

him a snack like this is normal this is

this is Strix is tiny

albino beholder can we're talking about

yes I'll give my screeching - that's

great

alright sorry uh loot yeah so I am

immediately intrigued by this back of

his chest claims that cannot be opened

by thieves yep so I would immediately

like to inspect it for any and all

possible mechanisms that could spring

any kind of trap also this was covering

like starfish's yes at least a couple

yeah I'm gonna

pull those a sizes I can get them

districts okay so yeah your remit you

removed the sea life from the chest and

you inspect it make a perception check

it does seem to have what is what looks

like a customary built-in lock on its

front but your your check might reveal

other things reception is 22 okay

this is no ordinary lock you think that

it is extremely complex lots of tumblers

deep in there to challenge and defy lock

picks who knows there might even be some

other there are some other curious

mechanisms you can make out in the lock

that you've never seen in a lock before

you can sort of divine that they too are

part of its defensive mechanism there

are no traps that you can detect from

the outside of the chest or by peering

into the lock cool I am so fascinated

like Strix is looking at the pie and

like cut 2d if looking at this chest not

moving cut to evil and suddenly tossing

tossing blankets off of her so evylyn

you are in this perfume scented

bedchamber that you

I mean it's ostentatiously decorated

it's a border line it's on the verge of

tasteful too gauche but you're struck by

a particularly large field of wardrobe

doors that dominate one entire wall of

this cabin and there's a big mirror next

to a vanity that you can see yourself in

and you can see you're you know you got

bed head and you obviously slept very

soundly for a part of the night anyway

nope

your your your armor bits are kind of

thrown over a chair parked near the door

even looks around for like a a piece of

paper or something she can write a note

on yeah

and she writes that's when you notice

there are some like muffins on a -

muffins on a platter but on a small

table by the chair that you can smell

them so they're fresh somebody must have

come into the room and left him there

for you know me and she like kicks out

the paper and she's like so sorry I fell

asleep

thanks for the muffin breakfast so kind

of you loved chatting about levander

last night could talk about the morning

Lord for hours lol heart heart isn't let

the under the best glad we're friends

see you at the temple love evylyn

serving ovals and ER all right

like second guessing sincerely no and

then she takes the muffins what's on her

armor sneaks a look in his closet

because boys got wardrobe and she got a

check out I mean like she gets this

sense that he might be some serious

fashion inspo so she checks that out

yeah he can give a lando calrissian it

run for the money in the capes

department to the boots the boots oh my

goodness the boots she she takes some

serious hashtag inspo although she's not

as into the de coeur she's a little bit

more with you know the d saturated you

know dried flower kind of thing with

their house but takes note and then she

cheerfully heads above deck okay the

other thing she notices is that although

the portals sort of round and they're

actually two in the room they are just

wide enough that she could theoretically

squeeze out a portal if she so wanted to

not saying you'd want to but you know if

you didn't want to go topside that's

another way out of this room she doesn't

see any reason why she could not go you

strap on your armor mmm yeah she gets

all ready smooth her hair in the mirror

okay

Strix

so the good berries that you use were

they created using the good berries

spell um that's what I was gonna ask you

I mean technically Strix could do that

spell how's that she she's got a nice

list she could do it cuz it's not like

cleric isn't a clerics ba it's uh let me

double-check that or is it true itself

it might be true I know it's all I know

it's on the druid list it is no not on

the clerics then she's just asking the

neighbor for them okay she can get them

from follow yeah hates her is that is

that true where is fall adjust angry

Court uh no she's she's just are they I

should say they are just private okay

well then if if follow gives Strix some

berries Strix will you know leave them

gifts bring them gifts for the berries

like just not also also fallen knows

that the all your other neighbors hate

your guts and if she were to show you

any visible compassion they probably

hate her to hate that okay

okay I'll get the pronouns right

eventually so yes you can get the good

berries from them and use them in the

pie that you baked make a performance

check for your pie okay

oh that's not bad do I add my and that's

my charisma bonus right in this case I

would like you to use something other

than charisma let's go with wisdom okay

that's okay that's plus nothing eighteen

okay

the pie seems to come out just fine it

smells good oh good

no one's hurt so also if they're gonna

be a little hand pies so you can just

eat them okay so there's a bunch of them

yeah that's a bunch of little so you're

thinking about you you put them

underneath the glass in the the display

people come in they sort of say oh

what's that that's new what's that yeah

and I'm just like that's a healing pie

are you hurt it'll fix you we're not

hurt do you get hurt not here they you

don't know that anyone can get hurt

anywhere

would you like me to tell me to tell you

about being anxious cuz that's what that

is and she just goes on a spiel

[Laughter]

throughout the day people ask you why

why would they come none of but yeah you

get the same spiel over and over again

people they they're interested and then

you tell them it's a healing pies like

but they don't need healing and so they

don't buy the pie then I change the sign

that says it's a healing pie special for

adventurers of Waterdeep and I draw a

little adventurer person with the sword

okay come on yeah and I make it all

glowy with prestidigitation in my

glowing quill and I make it shiny and

put it in the window and I let go - I

don't know if everyone's back yet but I

like go and like ask everyone does this

look like an adventure to you and it's

just like a really poorly drawn

yes squiggly probably doesn't think they

look that great so I don't ask squiggly

maybe maybe the kids the kid the kids

will dry you some new no need to yeah

yes I'm happy to have the kids draw some

adventures for me they won't listen they

will do that at a table perfect all

right

okay so you market it toward adventurers

yes

evylyn when you get topside you can see

that the the crew which consists

primarily of humans that maybe you spot

the occasional half elf here and they're

just doing tending to the matters of the

ship but it they're very laid-back in

casual and they don't seem to pay much

mind to you you do not see Jarl axel in

your travels but there is somebody here

who is wearing what looks like a

captain's hat who is chatting with the

bosun's mate and this individual but is

captain lorath farn

I'm sorry I got the name right wrong tar

wind re hook is his name Captain Airy

hook is you overhear him talking to the

bosun about going to the shore in a

dinghy this afternoon to do some

gambling apparently he likes the gamble

were we at the shore when she got on the

boat no you were teleported to the boat

right you stepped into a shadow with

Jarl axel and he bore you here

so to speak yeah sorry was not expected

I couldn't believe I couldn't believe it

was coming out of my mouth even as I

said it yeah you are in the middle of

the harbour a good distance away from

the shore of Waterdeep cool do I see any

reason why I would need to interact with

this captain not particularly unless you

wanted to arrange passage on a dinghy

which you probably don't because you

have your wing in boots but no okay I

don't need no passage also she feels

like it's super rude that she

accidentally fell asleep on the ship and

overstayed her welcome so she kind of is

just like whoops and just jumps over the

side yeah all right

as you're sort of skimming over the

water toward the shore make a perception

check

[Music]

18 oh that's very good okay so you leave

the ship fly off toward the city as you

sort of cast just a parting glance back

at the eye catcher you see something in

the water underneath it and you're not

exactly sure what it is but the Sun just

catches a gleam of something that looks

like it's parked underneath the ship

under the water well I gotta go check

that out so she goes she does another

wide circle back around to the ship and

just kind of skims over the water like

next to the boat okay not getting back

on the boat but just kind of like

checking in the water okay some of the

crew members are kind of watching you

because you're a flying you know mm-hmm

woman hi good morning in May the morning

Lord shine upon you and this dawn and

all all forward as you Circle the ship

you can see that there appears to be

another vessel mounted underneath it

what's this crab shaped she just is like

if anyone's looking at her she's like

what is this down here underneath the

boat you can see there's a little bit of

discussion on the ship now

what languages does evil and speak

elvish common and celestial one of the

humans turns to the captain and says in

elvish she knows too much

and the captain says we can't touch her

in elvish and then turns to you and says

in common it's nothing pay no mind

there's definitely something I see

something down here did you not know

there's something stuck to the bottom of

your ship I can go check it out if you

want no it's quite all right

go back to shore little bird okay

and she just dives underneath the boat

your eyes narrowing like all right as

you dive down just look like she's going

back to shore but she goes under the

boat instead of going over the boat so

she's just gonna go and see everything

that she can underneath it and then come

back up and go back to shore okay you

can see attached to the underside of the

eye catcher is a submarine not that you

know what that is but it is essentially

a metal vessel that has large wings

coming off the side it looks like it's

modeled or designed in the form of a

manta and it's got windows big windows

on the front and smaller portal windows

along its sides and it is lit within you

can see light coming out from inside of

it and and the whole thing looks like

it's about let's see 10 20 30 40 50 60

70 80 90 feet long and about 30 feet

wide well actually with the wings it's

even wider it's as wide as it is long

I'll swim right by the windows I see

anyone in there yes

you see drow two waves they don't

they're not looking at you they're

they're engaged in conversation or

dealing with other things you're out in

the dark water okay so you can see them

because they're lit but they can't see

you unless you go right up to the glass

now that's fine is relax all there does

she see dry LexA does not you see a

female drow a male drow and then you see

a second male drow on a flying deck at

the front of the ship is a two level

bridge and on the upper level you can

see a drow on the lower level you see no

little gnomes about two and a half feet

tall scurrying around and all kinds of

mechanical apparatus that they're

operating can I roll an insight check to

see if I can figure out anything about

like what their purpose might be or

their intentions absolutely that would

give me hmm

22 you believe that the gnomes are

basically engineers they're doing what

appears to be maintenance and systems

checks and things like that you don't

know exactly what they're doing but

that's the kind of the thrust of it you

can see they got little tools and tool

kits that they carry around with them

the the drow aren't doing anything they

just seem to be either guarding it

watching it or basically in a holding

pattern they look like they're just

waiting and they kind of look bored

you're inside check is gets the sense

that they're they've they're stuck down

here and probably have to remain here

until they're told to do something I

meant more like what what would this

ship before like is it a warship is it

exploration unclear you think it's your

best guess is that its stealth given

that they're drow inside it that makes

sense meaning because drow liked to stay

hidden and kind of work in the shadows

or because there is a lot of prejudice

against drow or right it is it is

unusual to see travel underwater but

this environment makes sense for them

it's dark and and they they nobody knows

they're here okay even does finishes her

Ark comes back up

they don't wave they're probably just

busy all right

Strix the signs are made so the display

is up and you just have to wait for some

adventurers to wander in okay I do I put

give squiggly one of those spinning

signs street corner sign

I give him one of those like street

corner signs and I'm like squiggly

pretend this is a gun and go outside and

spin it around and it says like he

likewise for adventurers what and only

good berry pie hell yeah can you please

like try oral performance to see how

good he can like yes but it'll be a

performance based on dexterity so

instead of using your instead of you so

actually just roll a d20 yeah such a

good image 17 okay

he's actually he gets good at it pretty

fast yeah he's like doing like the can't

actually rise like obviously people this

is eye-catching and like oh he's good at

flipping paper right yeah okay great and

then DF have touched base with you uh I

would love to just real gently get my

lockpick small up in there all right

nice okay go ahead and make a check for

the record DF is very much aware that he

is shirking off all of its other

responsibilities of course but this is

for him tenderly whisper you're insanely

high role for this

twenty nine okay you start to get your

lock picks in there and then you hear a

grinding noise and the lock actually

destroys them so you pull out the little

stubs that used to be your lock picks

yeah just like tingled okay okay

mmm-hmm all right okay looking through

like the rest of my lock there's

anything else

mmm even even like the anchor I would

use for all the tumblers would probably

get ground up too so I can't use that

okay that's fine I'm gonna open you up

just you wait

all right Miranda and Gwyneth you appear

you sort of fall just like a foot and

you are standing in the middle of a

bright sunny Park that is dotted with

tombstones and mausoleums but it's all

very beautiful

unlike the cemetery that you just left

which was foreboding and foggy and

decrepit with leaning headstones and

plundered tombs

this place looks pristine alabaster

walled mausoleums with beautiful vine

wrapped statues manicured trees and

shrubs and there are people wandering

about on the little hillock sand on the

cobblestone trails among the graves

there pushing baby carriages there

they're lovers walks there are there's

an old couple looking at the birds this

is some sort of weird cemetery park but

on the it's not so big that you can't

see the walls that enclose it and behind

those walls you can see the rooftops of

buildings suggesting that this this

walled cemetery is part of a very large

city but do we see the magician anywhere

you do not but as you recall before he

stepped into the portal he turns

invisible so he made me invisible nearby

and the Sun the the it's it's a warm day

and Gwyneth you feel the Sun beating

down on the ice that is your body and

you start to glisten and shimmer as the

heat begins to very very slowly melt

your form well first thing I'm gonna run

to the nearest Shay

that you can do there's a tree that's

offering abundant shade about 20 feet

away and that seems to you can you can

tell that you're not suffering in this

place do you want me to try and get a

higher perspective no not yet I'm gonna

run up to the nearest person and grab

them by the shoulders and say have you

seen a magician uh this old woman gasps

and then she sort of stops and then she

kind of looks into your eyes and she

just gets calm just sort of this elven

calm that you can even though you're

panicked

she's just captivated by your beautiful

eyes and she just stares into them goes

I haven't seen any magician okay never

mind what do you what what does he look

like dear what does he think so zolto

Benghazi is a shadow kai so he's like

this ghostly gray skinned elf but he is

dressed sort of in this Victorian mantle

cloak black as many shadow Kai favor is

his preferred color and he's got a top

hat that is weathered and worn his cape

is got red velvet lining on the inside

and he wears gloves and and he has a

monocle that he sometimes puts in one

eye if I use detect magic would I be

able to see the ring within range of the

spell yes and the range and that spell

is limited yes

I'll go ahead and just use it to see if

he is within range okay he's not within

30 feet of you when we had been prior to

the portal prior to the betrayal did I

get the sense of where he might be going

here that is a good question make an

inside check and actually Gwyneth can

make the check as well when if you don't

have insight as a skill but you can

still make a wisdom check first role of

the game and it's not 20 okay well yes

we're starting good yep so if zolto this

this charlatan who won his way into your

heart by helping you for several months

it's possible that he actually may be an

agent of the Raven Queen many shadow kai

are in which case this was sort of a

long con

to get the ring it dawns on you that

before you left the waffle crew they had

occasionally mentioned to you where they

came from they came from the city of

Waterdeep and if the ring is somehow

trying to figure out a way to get back

to palton maybe paltin is here and maybe

this is water deep there are they never

mentioned a large cemetery per se but

you know you're in a big city and you

can smell the coastal air I'm gonna turn

back to that old woman that I'd grabbed

her earlier and say is this water deep

yes yes dear this is water deep okay

that's a start

do you know a very sad-looking drunk man

with a

crazy instrument or a describing two of

my past husbands can you be more

specific

a teasing who's a little dirty but very

sweet at evening was a little dirty but

varies with no no no man with the he's

got like never mind okay I'm gonna go

I'll be I do these names yes its Strix

and paltin and yes they were my friends

yeah he's the one that does the dude to

do that I was talking about palton SEPA

the musician yes yeah where where where

is he oh he's everywhere the broadsheets

won't stop talking about him that's not

helpful but yeah and she says I was only

I had one of those broad sheets with me

find out where he's performing it's a

what he's a musician he's performing in

the city to sold-out crowds are there

flyers is there something I can find I

need to find him well Jerry if you go

into the city proper on any street

corner you can find abroad cry or maybe

they can help you in the middle of her

talking Myranda leaves and she goes to

grab Gwyneth's and just walk away okay

she has a direction she's that's that's

when the woman sees this almost

crystalline figure hiding out underneath

a tree and she she just sort of gasps

and collapses oh oh no that's uh I don't

have time for this don't die and then

she just leaves and gwennyth are you

going with her yeah okay trying to stick

to the shadows as much as I can

okay hopping from having from a shady

spot a shady spot but if I pass the old

lady I'm going to

I am so sorry okay and you know what

happened you kind of make this kind of

very soft almost melodic crackling noise

as you move which you're totally

accustomed to and Brenda's as well but

it must seem strange to these people

because you start to see other people

other folks in the park have noticed

that the old woman has fainted they're

not exactly sure what happened but they

see a elf woman and a ice woman moving

away and so they sort of go in toward

the woman to make sure she's okay and as

they leaned down to help her get back up

to her feet they their instant they

seemed instantly suspicious of you like

you had something to do with this

woman's fainting spell like maybe she

was robbed I don't have time to stop and

talk to them so that's fine they can

okay be suspicious of me all they want I

don't care okay and the two of you make

your way to the edge of the cemetery

eventually following a path that leads

you to one of the gates that lead out

through the wall to the great city of

Waterdeep beyond and then what do you do

I'm going to find either a bulletin

board or something with notes fliers

anything or or any kind of town

literature literature you're looking for

literature and you start to run through

the streets for broad Criers and posted

words and things so water davian's are

known for being pretty tolerant and it

takes a lot to turn their heads a elf

leading a woman made of ice through the

streets is not something they are

accustomed to seeing and so you all eyes

turn to you wonder just amazement I'm

going to stop it in a shadow and take my

cloak of many fashions off and I want to

make it into something that is thermal

something that will keep heat out

and as a hood and we'll disguise witness

something white would also be

appropriate yeah okay so who cast that

over Gweneth and suddenly she takes on

the the foreman semblance of a figure

indistinguishable from most of the

humanoids in the city you've sort of you

can still see her hands in her face of

course but she is for the most part

cloaked and you think that this will

help repel some of the heat that is

bearing down on her what she can't find

a shady spot to stand in okay

I'm gonna grab her hand and continue

forward trying to find anything that'll

lead me to the group okay paulten thou

is performing splendidly but make a

perception our sorry if performance

check aided by Simon so you get

advantage okay

Simon's charm goes a long way twenty-two

okay another spectacular performance you

enthrall the crowd at the yawning portal

tavern which is packed there is a big

well shaft in the middle as you know of

the only portal which plunges down into

some deep dark dungeon that you hope to

never go into and but there all these

tables around and then on the balcony

overhead there are people leaning down

to hear you leaning over the balcony to

catch sight of you lots of ah and hand

waving and all kinds of adoring men and

women and others and other creatures

this all pleases Durnin the proprietor

because you know lots of ale being sold

and earns the envy of some other

musicians who have to follow you and you

wrap your set mmm you hop off your stool

Simon hands you a towel

and he dabs his home forehead and your

throng is eager to buy drinks for you

mmm fantastic like trying to like walk

through a crowd just like scuse me sorry

I yes and and you've had Simon's got his

little gesture cap out and he's it's

full of money

that people are just thrown into the Hat

so he certainly you kind of ties it off

like a little sack I was hoping he'd

like where it is just like big and that

would be I guess I guess he could stuff

him down the because it's a jester hat

he's got these long bits that the coins

could sort of hang in and so he's a sort

of jingling and jangling and it sort of

being pulled down pulled down tight over

his head yeah is anyone disturbed by the

severed hand I'm just curious

no okay it's part of the Act it's it's

cool it's right yeah it's like the

Addams Family everyone's like no that's

that's normal

yes and you you've throw yourself down

at a table with your your fans gathered

around you people want signatures all

that but I think drinks come in freely

constantly a what he call

waiter basically keeps the flagons as

soon as one empties another one shows up

it's all been paid for some Nobles young

and old come by to congratulate you one

of them hopes that you'll perform at his

cousin's birthday party in three months

your your cousin has a great Bar Mitzvah

okay and then in the chaos as you're

sitting around the table and people are

moving

you a dark figure moves to sit across

from you and you see that it is a

shatter Kai a long white hair gray ashen

skin pointy ears bloodshot eyes crooked

smile and a monocle and he pushes a

black silk handkerchief across the table

toward you and flips it open and it's

the ring of winter almonds just

immediately like just instantly Sobers

up you just like yells out it's like

everyone out right now clear out there's

so much noise that is hard to even hear

I was hoping that would go a lot better

is the like it's like the owner or

whatever like around you can you can't

see him but you he's got to be behind

the bar he's always behind the bar and

the bar is like 10 feet that way but

there's just this wall of moving people

between you and him

you might catch occasional flashes of

him through the crowd your great your

groupies don't understand what you're

telling them I'll at least try to get

like everyone at the table to like clear

out okay like I need everyone but this

one to leave go okay they they will

leave and so you do have this you're not

you're not feeling the crowd pressing

around you anymore mm-hmm I just kind of

to you and your eyes go blue and go and

you can see all down your hand where

you're holding the ring in the veins all

go glowing blue and you can't let go so

this is the real deal good to know

like I'm like trying to my right so I

like try to just hold it as far from me

as I can yeah just did not actually put

it on so that's when a metal hand grabs

your wrist and you see a robed figure

with alabaster white skin

almost angelic features black hair with

an articulated metal hand and arm that

goes all the way up to his elbow and he

just clenches your wrist so tight that

your hand goes numb roll initiative he

was a chicken oh boy yeah yawning

mission it was a 17 okay I love Bolton's

attitude

grappled and I immediately recognized

him right yes you you confronted him

briefly at house growl and he was the

one I counterspell yes hater I'm just

like Oh D&D Thanos is back great okay

like hi how don't don't

I know you're very excited about him

being here too before I do anything is

it's like a we could talk it out

situation or do or did you see thank you

for bringing in my memory

oh that's not gonna work I'm going to

quick question since since last time

have we taken a long rest okay that's

good to know

you are fully loaded in every respect

all right sweet so I'm going to go so so

it's just I knew either view fully

attuned to the ring you have all of its

powers ok let me just bring up an old

email really quick particular oh no cool

so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna cast

a big B's hand made of ice and just try

a punch him in the face okay nice

ok so Big B's big hand of ice

mmm-hmm Kapow since this is a clenched

fist make a melee spell attack okay

is it still lots 9 to hit it sure is

okay okay that is a big icy hand

manifests in the air that is a 24 and

punches man soon in the face

okay so roll your demos okay what's the

damage on that I don't know so it'll be

four d8 cold damage okay all right

you punch man soon 4:16 he is still

grabbing on to you looks like he has

more more hit points okay Simon well at

least for the moment crawl under the

table good boy han drew leaps on

mansions face alright that shocks me as

Andrew clenches on to mention that

shocks the wizard enough to break his

grip on your wrist sweet I'm going to go

ahead

oh wait no it's not my turn just it's

not your turn all right at this point in

time not to be left out late / for his

performance fellow members of the waffle

crew DF Evelyn and Strix come in to the

establishment asking if if paltin has

you know when when Parton's coming on

[Laughter]

the entire way as we're traveling there

you just hear like gifs boys getting

closer and closer doors saying something

on the lines like I don't want to watch

the show I wanna go for that treasure

chest we're already late

yeah when you walk in the door one of

the bouncer says oh you just missed them

he just wrapped his set you're like

sorry and that's through the crowd you

can see Paulson sitting at a table this

ice fist just smashed some guy in the

face oh not again

do I see them you do you can no no I

spot them I'm just holding the RAM just

like hey guys looks like it's exactly

what it looks like strikes just drops

the starfish Verizon I'll catch up later

we're in trouble strix that's a 12 12

yeah 20 20 evylyn 10 10 okay

but that you guys will basically get in

and after next round as we cycle back

through man soon

is why not we're good I can give you

reasons why not so we'd always feel a

little scared when Chris just says why

not about his feeling especially

forgiving he also casts Bigby's hand but

his is a big metal hand he is going to

try to use his to grasp you and he rolls

a thirty on his attack role so you are

you are in the grip of his medal at 30

in a tack role that's an attack so so

since you are oh we actually has

advantage on the attack role but never

mind anyway 33 it's so you are now

grappled and he will then use a bonus

action to have it slowly crush you okay

and that is going to be

of spell-casting ability modifier that

does okay so that will be 15 points of

bludgeoning damage as the middle hand

crushes you and this hand is huge it's

like an 8 foot hand that's got you

bodily but chair that you're in is

basically crushed to Flinders and you

are in its grasp

okay as a reaction I'm gonna use cutting

words and that means I get to roll my

inspiration die to take that much off

the attack great off the attack or the

damage damage okay great I think that

says it yeah attack roll ability check

your damage roll okay right I mean you

just insult him this doesn't hurt I'm

fine I'm good that's a seven so take

seven off you take eight cool it's

something all right like so my cutting

words after it's like Ken damage I'm

just like hey man if your next attack

could do another even 10 that'll put me

at 16 and HP and that'd be really funny

I shall take that ring off your crushed

corpse and then it's like not it be my

friends have anything tourney he then

turns to the crowd and says flee flee of

your value your lives

Oh people people start to panic as this

big ice fist and this big metal fist are

our present and this wizard is screaming

at them Alden like insists again if my

friends have anything to say that's your

that's the clan soon will point to the

shadow Chi magician and say kill him who

me

I just met him you don't know who he's

talking to until two invisible creatures

suddenly actually no more than that

eight invisible creatures it's a little

more than to appear all around the

awning portal some are up in the balcony

some are in the corners on the ground

floor some are standing only ten feet

away from you paltin but they are a

giant demonic creatures with green skin

they stand about nine feet tall each

their wings folded tightly behind them

they they basically look like big green

demons and each of them is wielding a

great axe good and one of them will

immediately push through the crowd over

to this shadow kai and make two attacks

against him hitting him both times

another one will do the same hitting him

once and I'll just take average damage

you can see that the shadow kai is

bloodied under this barrage of axe

blades now you can see that the way that

these creatures are all moving suggests

that some of them are mirror images

and after these demons attack these

images all sort of coalesce around them

and shuffle around so that you can't

tell which one is the real one and which

one isn't and then they kind of split

off again and stand in different parts

of the room all right

that is their turn oh oh yeah oh okay so

back at the top of the initiative order

death hello

you are not dear you are a doppelganger

impersonating d/f you must attack the

shadow chi-wai as as mansion just

ordered you to what Strix you are not

the real Strix you with our doppelganger

Strix working for Manchu and evylyn you

are not the real evylyn you are an evil

and doppelganger working for a Manchu

yes sir okay so yes you do not have

magical weapons no but you have ordinary

counterparts okay all right and the real

one decides to go deep okay so this dear

Bob makes his death way up through the

shadow kai D F Lee know how to death and

doesn't in such a very poor fashion yes

now I'm tracking

I've got your statistics you don't have

to worry about any of that okay I just

need to know your intent and then I'll

tell you that you need to roll an attack

with a plus six modifier to the d20 role

okay and you'll do your normal damage so

I was ordered to take attacked the

shadow Chi right yep yeah so I guess I'm

using just a regular short sword you

have one that's like a fake looking

gutter or something exactly

and then I try to do something really

fancy and flirty but it's really she -

okay the the shatter Kai nimbly springs

up after the withering blows of the axe

blades rain down upon him by these

demonic creatures he dodges out of the

way with a bit of a flourish of his cape

and confounds you as you stand there

perplexed yes and I say do you ever see

it's me yes paltin what do you do when

you see DF suck like seams par for the

course but do I get the sense that these

are I mean they're attacking they're

listening man soon they are clearly

obeying man soon so either he has it one

of two possibilities he has ensorcelled

your friends which is possible he's a

wizard or worse or these are not your

friends okay

and being as you've had doppelganger

encounters involved with the Sitaram

which mention leads you're inclined to

believe the latter cool great they sent

in the stunt doubles yes cool so am I

still in the grips of this thing

you sure are would I still be able to

like cast with the ring or there is

nothing stopping you from taking actions

you just can't move so you can still use

the ring and do things well okay

grappled so how many charges were on the

ring 20 total 20 okay and risking the

biskits remembering back to one of the

last times I tried something new with

the ring that they had suggested how

many charges would it be to try and

summon that ice dragon you believe that

that would be somewhere in the

neighborhood

of eight charges Chris I'd like to try

and summon that ice dragon okay cool oh

yeah do I add anything to the roll no

you don't have to roll one ice dragon

coming right up what okay so as you

channel the power of the Ring you see

all that all the blue veins go right up

into your body up your neck around

around your neck through your arms you

you feel your heart just sort of stop

and then outside through the windows all

the windows sort of blow open as this

cold gale rushes in and the sky outside

becomes very dark and then you hear a

roar from somewhere outside the inn oh

my god oh my god oh my god oh my god

all right you start to see a few on the

wind coming blowing in through the

window some flakes of snow all right

you see mr. Paulson summoned a nice

dragon

cool yeah all right um I was like oh oh

he's just like pointing at 20 a mansion

like oh oh man soon holds out his metal

arm and a staff appears in it it is a

metal shod staff capped with sort of an

arcane design but he is still

concentrating on that big bees hand

spell you are not concentrating on your

big bees hand spell oh yeah so it goes

that's fine poof

and so he will while concentrating on

the spell

cast

I have to check that he is just going to

basically stick you with the staff now

and you feel a charge of energy rush

through it as he attempts to attack you

that's your grappled so he has advantage

on his attack role that's going to be a

17-2 hit all right he does

14 points of force damage okay as he

sticks you with the end of his staff and

then the hand crushes you for another 15

so that's a total of 29 points on his

turn cool

good all right his demon monster things

oh I forgot the magician

turns into a flock of Ravens it's so

cool there's Dobbs and flies out the

window

goddammit hey Chris yes out of combat

question do I see this dragon and is it

snowing outside snow is falling over

water deep the Summer Sun has been

blotted out by clouds and suddenly you

are very cold as the temperature drops

about 10 degrees immediately then you

hear this loud roar and you're not

exactly sure where it's coming from and

then you see this cold air in the skies

over the castle ward coalesce into a

nice dragon

out of nothing

that's where I'm going as fast as

possible alright yeah I'm gonna sprout

my ice wings wings just come out of

Gwyneth's back and they begin to flutter

with a sound of just like crunching

paper and she takes to the air toward

the ice dragon from the air you can see

that the sudden change in the weather

coupled with the appearance of the

dragon in a city that is not accustomed

to seeing dragons or allowing dragons in

their midst has created a widespread

panic

Gweneth from your vantage point you can

see people running for the any buildings

they can get to and it is getting colder

every second okay

so I'll have the two of you roll

initiative just so we can keep things

straight Miranda okay what's right right

dirty oh five yeah dirty 20 dirty 28

outstanding okay so we want to do do

soon next up is double strikes so Doppel

strikes you don't have spells I smelled

good so you can basically bash things

when you can bash things with your fake

staff okay in a very probably like

unlike strict manner this doppelganger

is incredibly brave it just runs in and

starts trying to hit halten with her

stuff okay go ahead and roll it roll a

d20 and add six okay that's 17 that hits

palton I'm sorry and actually would have

advantage because he's grappled so roll

again in case you get a crit just in

case you probably not okay so then roll

a d6 and add four

that's how much damage you do alright

okay so that's only five damage five

damage to Paul yeah

and she's just like it's just like a

bonk on the head and yeah just like at

least now you know that you know watch

out for those edges actually I realize

doppelgangers get two attacks so yeah

yeah you would have had a second but no

matter

go ahead make ups yes you get to hit him

again with your staff do you see the

first time just like don't do it again

it's only 15 don't do it again

what's Paul's ac15 do I hit classes 56

plus 4 Wow topless Turks is really scary

damage it's sharp that stuff is sharp

it's not edges like stop definitely no

it's her because she smells good I

rather Doppel evylyn does the fact that

winter has fallen over water deep maybe

alert the actor I'll get to those at the

bottom okay alright Doppel evylyn what

does man shooting told her to do that

the magician is now he's telling you to

turn set your sights on paltin she and

she has all of her normal weapons but

they're not magical correct so she has a

normal great sword does she have also

her normal great axe her normal battle

axe

yeah battle axe the other man she does

and her and and and a fake emoji shield

that doesn't actually I guess I don't

know I just feel like a doppelganger

Elin would use her battle axe but it's

perfectly okay use it to hand it to if

you want yeah yeah you'll do DDT 10

instead of dat throws down the fake

emoji shield and uses it to handed okay

oops

my first attack is

Oh 12 that does not but you get it sorry

you have advantage because paltin has

grappled so roll again

I'm trying Nate I'm trying dad 6:17 add

six at six to my already know just the

d20 plus six Oh

instead of my plus nine encourage gotcha

all that all the doppelgangers are plus

six on their attacks 1414 is amiss your

second attacker just wildly swinging

that was my second okay actually it came

dangerously close with a 14 and your so

your first attack was what total first

attack would have been with a six nine

okay great so two misses both year blows

bounced off of the metal gauntlet that

seems to be crushing paulten in its

grasp

just a little buzzing be like oh can she

fly if she doesn't have magic she can't

so she's sort of trotting across the

ground she's running that's guys yes

arms yes mm-hmm

so Miranda you are making a beeline for

the dragon you've got it's gonna take

you a while to get there unless you like

hitch a ride or there are horse-drawn

coaches that pull people through the

streets like handsome Zord rays and then

there are just so you could essentially

either you probably your best bet is to

commandeer one of those okay um unless

you can fly or move quickly

well what what's gonna use two hidden

paths oh okay just 120 feet yeah so

strange for you to use this in the city

that you find you do it and so you make

your way through the city getting closer

and closer and closer it gets colder and

colder and colder as you approach the

dragon which will act on Paul tins next

turn the rest of the waffle crew evylyn

yours you're done skimming across the

water and they're sort of flying over

the dock ward

when you see all the clouds magically

for

blotting out the Sun in the sky which is

very alarming but then when the

temperature suddenly drops you're a

little bit surprised magic must be a

foot then when you hear the coalescing

wind to gather into the form of a

roaring dragon made of entirely of ice

your worst fears take hold but the

dragon itself is there you have no idea

where paltin is oh no not this again

absolutely not that's her jaw and she

goes right after the dragon and I would

think that if she does maybe she Maranda

it possibly I'm gonna have you make a

perception check as you race toward the

dragon eight okay

possibly more characteristic of even

death

you are upstairs in your room looking at

the chest like your arch your arch

nemesis yeah he's like sitting on the

floor across my chest on like just

crossed-legged stop staring at me like

how am I gonna do this window blows open

snow comes in just a few flakes one of

them lands right on your eyeball and you

hear the roar of a dragon it gets very

cold as does yes internally like yeah

it's been around the magic enough to

know exactly he's felt this cold before

yeah and then right away if he doesn't

have already have his equipment he maybe

like grabs it and puts it on and just

gels restricts as loudly possible to

cancer wherever she is up in the house

in here

and then from death's window mm-hmm

are there nearby rooftops are way down

to the street because he's in such envy

and such immediate urgency

I just want even bother going downstairs

to the front door he's out the window

and like towards this yes there is a

balcony below him on he's on the fourth

floor balcony below him on the second

floor outside waffles den that he could

easily scamper down and from there to

the street yep okay yeah exactly that's

that's precisely what it looks like he

Park down the side of the

building and lands in the cobblestone

street all right

yeah cutting action is - the fastest

possible superfast Brittany okay you see

ice forming on the conical roof tops of

some of the tallest buildings he's

pushing himself to his upper limits okay

strikes you heard death scream your name

all right it's not the you did something

like funny bad but it's the things are

really bad kind of scream so yeah she'll

just look at Albion is doing please take

the path the oven and then it's already

at the other pious children grab a

couple of the good berry pies and just

like stuff Mandir a robe and just like

run outside push squidly back in the

door close the door okay when you're

right outside you feel the cold air but

yeah she's not even like really acting

like her usual panicked self like this

is like we don't fix this things are

gonna get really bad so she like pushes

them in close the door might even lock

the door like from the outside like

maybe she's had a key this whole time I

don't know yeah maybe she pulls that

locks that she just reflexively grabs

the peach yeah and she's like search

staff into a broom and just immediately

takes off okay leaving a big cloud of

black smoke behind you guys you take to

the air and she'll just follow DF from

the top from above evylyn

evylyn you would see the distant smoke

trail of Strix his broom coming up into

the sky but she's well and truly on the

far side of the city reassured alright

but she stays the course she knows that

means strict I'll be there alright

assemble yes for sanity's reasons I'm

going to now that signal now that we're

now that we're at the bottom of the

initiative I'm gonna stop for danger we

understand that you and your

doppelgangers are acting on the same

around just for my own sanity but before

that happens

Durnan leaps over the bar drawing a

black black handled long or great sword

that he has hidden behind the bar and he

will bear the great sword at mansion and

say release him o Durnan during its

strong and

[Music]

Durnin seems pretty firm you don't

attack his musicians particularly his

gifted ones and gwennyth what would you

like to do based on your realization

that this ice dragon has formed and you

know instinctively that it was formed

using the same magic that created you I

do i is there any way for me to know

where the source came from you can

because you are a cold creature

basically move you can track the coal

the temperature change and always move

to where it's coldest and that is

basically a straight line pointing you

at a place in the heart of the city and

can I see Miranda from where I am

you lose her in the streets the

buildings are so tall it's hard and

she's also zapping like poof poof

disappearing from sight you've lost

sight of her you also reckon that the

source the death the destination

are bearing down on is basically right

below the dragon

I'm also keep heading towards the dragon

so you know that's where Miranda's

headed okay you can cover a good amount

of distance just a straight shot little

flakes of ice coming off behind you and

the snow starts to get a little heavier

falling from the sky DF and Doppel DF

let's deal with Doppel the others get

him out of the way sure you have two

attacks coming on paltin actually no

mention has you turn on Durnan before

actually rolling he like gets down onto

his butt first and then like eggs up and

then it rolls over wheels yes okay to is

either hokage go ahead and make your two

tax plus six on each one is 16 the other

is 24 okay both pearce Durnin you can

see underneath his shirt Durnin has what

appears to be some elven chainmail but

you're able to get through that armor

and wound him both times alright so then

I was rolling very short sword yep D 6

plus 4 plus 4 okay 15 total

Durnin looks at you paulten and says I

think I feel an insect biting me

whoo Dane Oh it's called Joe ass

irrelevant di okay

I got I look dirty so I'm in here

because that's gonna be business see I

got I got Chris - oh I wish I wish

to everyone watching on the stream right

now could see Chris's table as he has

like three or four different yes I have

I have to move annihilation

I have cursive strawed I have dragon

heist players hand luck Monster Manual

dmg all relevant can't see it but the

information from the books are actually

like slowly floating towards Chris's

right right next

so that was double death real death

you're buckin yeah you realize you can

get there a lot quicker if you steal a

couch

I will not okay I figure you wouldn't

but I'd ask there yep captain Diaz would

row does not steal just be authority

seizing a necessary vehicle don't he

moves pretty fast DF when he wants yeah

I'm pretty quick yeah all right so

you're darting just darting and

parkouring your way through the streets

yeah so how far away is the unimportant

from where I am I'm glad you asked

because I have the map somewhere under

these this mound of it there we go

so from troll skull ally to the yawning

portal you are looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

8 9 10 11 12 blocks

so a good hike basically you have to run

down Dells Oran Street to the highroad

then follow the high road all the way

down to snail Street and then dodge

through snail Street to get to be on a

portal I know enough shortcuts through

my city sequence background feature

hell yes some hello you can fold space

in the city just like just like this we

disappeared nice over there now

yeah so death is making rocket time do

ya if you think you'll be there next

round just like breathing in like cold

air the entire yes yes yes exactly

yeah the other thing you notice is that

as the little particles of snow fall

toward the ground they don't quite sit

on the ground they just sort of they

become slower and slower and slower

until they stop and then they begin to

make their way up look what have you

wrought okay so next up is palton SEPA

your dragon comes crashing through the

roof of the awning portal tearing it

asunder

turn is like oh crap as large chunks of

the ceiling cascade and fall all around

use your grapples you're not doing

anything

I need the doppelgangers to make

dexterity saving throws it's just is it

what is it for them that's a good

question so for them it's plus four hey

I got a 9 fail success even I was 10 oh

10 sorry

alright as the roof of the yawning

portal collapses and falls in word since

most of the people had previously

evacuated or moved into other safe areas

very few were hurt however both Doppel

evylyn and double Strix get crushed by

following the rubble

oh no they're both still alive but

knocked prone and under debris and they

are both bloodied Oh Jax yeah BB F

double D F you take half damage and are

not not buried or not too prone the

demon creatures the debris falls around

them but appears to have no effect on

them it just sort of bounces off

harmlessly and man soon also has to make

a saving throw I hope you get smushed

I'll take some damage regardless another

icon the realms destroyed by alright

mansion makes the saving throw and takes

half damage as well and is not not

knocked prone this is the second amount

of damage he's taken as as bits of the

ceiling and roof collapsed down upon him

paltin miraculously you were not in any

area of debris it's like the dragon

somehow knew not to damage you and now

this big-ass ice dragon is in your midst

what would you like it to do what you

know it's a big dragon made of ice

alright I don't really know what I can

do so it can it can it can attack it can

fly it can roll over and it can sit all

right man the dragon just look around be

like all right this is Sikkim

[Laughter]

it can also play dead all right

you're not specifying a target so it

will pick one did you do one two three

four five OH six seven

there's a seven how inconvenient okay

for Durnan for what it's worth um was I

didn't specify mainstream but I

definitely meant for sure I guess that's

fine I know for future reference the

dragon will attempt to bite Durnan

succeeding Bessie no ah mean Dern Anna

still alive

then it will claw him twice I'm gonna

just repeatedly pointed manchu and be

like yeah and then it will once it once

it gets through its thick icy head who

you actually meant after turning takes a

pile of damage wait 13 okay Durnan is

still not bloodied after being raked by

two claws and bitten by the ice dragon

who then takes its tail and tries to

slap man soon across the room yeah

alright man soon is struck he takes 15

points of damage and is sent careening

all the way across the tavern into a

wall and his spell is broken the weed

the gauntlet disappears can I do

something then you sure can alright I'm

gonna so so who's who's immediately on

me then is it the doppelgangers ah it is

their promo so double yeah they're

they're buried under rubble and prone

but they're right next to you double D I

switched his target to Durnin but he's

also pretty he's the next closest target

who isn't buried to you but there

also the big demon guys who act right

after you and they have they have

duplicates three duplicates each so

there appears to be a dove them but

there are in fact only two okay so then

you'd say that they're all my targets

are probably within 15 feet of me

probably okay then I'm gonna go ahead

and do a six level thunder wave kaboom

sure it's faring better than port nine

Zaru right so double D F you're a con

save bonus is plus two against that

seventeen okay and actually Doppel Strix

and Doppel evil and you're in the range

2 so plus two all right saving throws I

am I won't dodge it and he like dives

towards I rolled eight okay what's your

DC there Nate seventeen okay so all of

them failed the two demons also failed

cool so roll your damage alright time to

do math

[Music]

a so that is a total of 34 all right

double D F is looking very hurt I took

like true damage

doppel Strix Doppel Strix and Apple

evylyn are killed by the sonic blast oh

no and hurl the all three of them are

hurled backward away from you

the demons when the doppelgangers died

do they revert back to their true forms

they do so you see Doppel Strix and

double evil and now in their true

doppelganger forms browse oh my god who

would have thunk it alright

and that's Halton stern hand rue what

would you like hand ro to do just sort

of scuttling around on the floor right

now is so are any of the targets

standing or is everyone kind of prone

everybody's been knocked back ten feet

including the demons and their doubles

cool I want to take hand rue and

actually see okay just got to pull up

another quick email actually while

you're doing that Simon is going to sort

of grab the legs of the table and just

sort of drag it across the floor so he

can stay under it until he makes his way

over to a safe spot skirting around

skirting around the debris as he goes

he's a good boy cool I'm gonna I'm gonna

pick up Andrew okay was gonna okay you

got him

so that's it for Nate next up is the

demons they are going to come at you

Paul to Zappa okay Lord of the Ring

nothing between you and them so they'll

just come at you one of them hits you

twice but what were they the roles are

27 and 25 okay so one of them hits me

twice okay oops wrong dice one does 71

hit does 17 points of slashing damage

okay and the other hit does 21 for a

total of 38

okay I'm gonna I'm gonna use cutting

words again okay and a d-10 off of that

okay 38 - 38 - 1028 cool still hurts a

lot the second one will do the same this

one is rolling a 27 and 820 I only get

one reaction for tone correct yes okay

well those real so that one does oops

wrong dice again cook I have an aversion

to right we're really d12 source um the

first attack does 19 and the second

attack does 19 for a total of 38 cool I

am down okay you collapse underneath the

the withering blows and fall unconscious

Manchu will race to your body and take

the ring off your finger or rather try

please no okay

let's see who else for reals is in the

room none of you okay great

Vernon indeed mm-hmm and skip since

there's nobody here for a real

perspective of what's happening I'm just

going to jump to cool tricks because

your next leadership order you're a

bombing along on your broom flying

through the air you can see the dragon

has crashed down into a building which

as you get closer you recognize as the

yawning portal okay and you do remember

pölten saying something about performing

at the yawning portal earlier that okay

I'm putting it together yep and I've

gotten ahead of deaath right uncertain

okay okay I don't I remember the last

time that I went into an inn where

palton was in it with the ring of winter

and it did not turn out well and my

brain gears slowly come to remember that

and I am just going to looks and see

where deaath is and just kind of just

follow him okay make a perception check

to spot death because the last time I

went into the end by myself things were

real bad that's a sixteen okay you do

catch sight of him moving with blinding

speed parkouring his way through the

alleys and streets and record pace and

finding passages you who have lived in

the city most of your life did not even

know existed

that's neat good I do something yeah

sure this whole time I am blowing my

horn of secret danger oh yeah nice it's

too uh alerts Strix

evylyn of my presence around direction

and where I'm going and be like help

help help

okay yeah I'm not going I don't know

what's in the end I don't know what's

happening in the end I don't know all I

did see is this dragon but and honestly

the best thing I can do is if I'm close

enough to the dragon I'm going to try to

maybe polymorph it just to get it out of

the way cuz I don't know whose dragon

that isn't I don't want to Dragon okay

what's the range of your polymorph yeah

[Music]

pretty good thing it's a 60 feet okay

you're not in range okay

well I am just going to and at this

point it sort of disappears into the

superstructure of the building okay its

tail is the last thing you see as it

goes down into it Higgens thrashing

around alright okay well then I'm going

to do the second best thing that I can

do which is you know what if I can't see

inside the end can I stop wait I'm too

far away damn it okay or something then

I'll just like swing by D then just slap

him a death Ward okay there your death

warden and I'm looking and I'm looking

around for evylyn to see if she's there

for a death Ward - if I don't see her uh

sorry

so as Strix does that yes well as he's

running while say Strix please no matter

what just stay close and stay in sight

do you think okay stay with the others

okay um next up is let's see evil in

Martine alright

so evil in you are with now within range

of the in you saw strictest trail coming

toward the end and then it suddenly

plunged down somewhere into the city

several blocks away the reasons unknown

but then you got the blaring horn of DF

sounding off and you suddenly realize ah

Strix is doing her death

ward trick and I do I gather at this

point that we're all heading for the

unemployed or absolutely there's no

question does even know that Paulson was

supposed to perform at the yawning

portal yes once she sees once she saw

the dragon sort of plunged down into the

yawning portal she put the pieces

together as quickly as Trix did mm-hmm

she dives into the yawning portal all

right then you are the first Oh make a

perception check I hope you do a

three-point here all and totally

perception is 12 okay you see two before

you go down into the end you see two

people outside of it a woman made of ice

with beautiful wings flying from the

opposite direction also toward the end

you've never seen her before but she

looks like another ice construct like

something the ring must have made you

also see Miranda in the street outside

below and you haven't seen her since

child so the evil ones like on a mission

then she sees the ice lady and she's

like she's like paulding oh and she's

like she's like hi Miranda miss you just

a second okay then then evylyn you are

there when man soon puts the ring of

winter on his finger and the dragon

turns to attack mansion and mansion just

holds up its hand like this and the

dragon stops and he says you're mine now

evylyn does not like the ring of winter

at all

she's a very visceral reaction to it jet

just-just-just for my own entertainment

at least in my head cannons and the

dragon come down to bite them and a

mansion with the rain just gives up yeah

that works perfect that that fits the

the head cannon much better done that's

that's now cannon you know then you also

bend in half of water do you even you

see paltin lying just absolutely

massacred @mentions feet I was laughing

because I think this is probably a bad

idea but this is what he was gonna do

she's going to like she dives bombs in

she sees the ring she's gonna go plant

her feet on his shoulder grab the ring

on his finger and just like race like a

child trying to pull this ring or his

finger okay yeah see you as he's got his

hand up like this to stop the dragon you

basically descend upon his arm and try

to wrench the ring from his finger go

ahead and make a strength check strength

athletics just for giggles dang it it's

only a 12 okay so you might get

advantage for being really really upset

yeah but you able so you sort of reach

and kind of grab hold of him but he's

able to sort of clench his fist and

basically prevent the ring from being

removed and I need a little if it were

yeah this tiny little girl basically

trying to rip his fingers off you can

see if it were maybe like a normal hand

you'd be able to pry his fingers open

but when that metal hand is clenched it

is tight well and she has like she has

her feet like on his shoulder

[Music]

yeah exactly

Miranda Gwyneth you are now within sight

of this building the awning portal is a

large rambling two multi-story tavern

that now looks in shambles most of its

rooftop collapsed snow falling all

around you slowly you can hear the

dragon inside

crunching furniture beans whatever is

down there you saw evylyn who Miranda

you recognize plunge into the building

and you can hear her threat

grunting away inside there you can also

hear the backfire of Strix is broom and

you see her race up above the buildings

once again coming very close to the

building now and you can see DF striding

out of an through alleys out into the

street now now just within a breath of

reaching the outside of the awning

portal and that's Miranda when a portal

forms in the air near you in front of

the yawning portal a big spiraling gate

opens up and a Tyrannosaurus Rex

what drops through let me out of there

with a rider on its back and you see

this resplendent woman in golden armor

her majesty undiminished by the weather

by the grey by the snow and that's where

we'll stop

hi guys it's Paul - dad will find out

next week for part two of this spectacle

during which Christina Arielle tigner

will be rejoining us in her role as a

Lassonde ray Burton how do you make a

portal for a t-rex where are the

components for that oh my gosh I love

that Chris is just like let's do all of

it now as well holding for a split

second has enough consciousness to look

around and say we're in the endgame now
